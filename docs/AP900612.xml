   Here is a brief look at positions and public
statements of leaders of new Soviet political parties and movements:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VLADIMIR ZHIRONOVSKY, Liberal Democratic Party: We are not
saying equal rights for private property; we are saying private
property. This is an absolute priority.
   It's OK after 70 years to throw people into the sea _ not to
make them homeless or throw them out of work, but to make them
start to feel again and think how to earn.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   NIKOLAI TRAVKIN, who is forming a populist party: The party
wants to create a society of equal opportunity. ... A normal
society can create ordinary social justice, not the other way
around.
   The goal of a party must not be to work within the system, but
to break up the system.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OLEG RUMYANTSEV, Russian Social Democratic Party: Our party must
be a party of social democracy rather than a union for the struggle
against totalitarianism.
   Taking into account the condition of our society, torn apart
under the cover of social phraseology, we cannot afford to call
ourselves socialists.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   VYACHESLAV SHOSTAKOVSKY, Communist Party Higher Party School: We
have become accustomed to looking at the party as a unique army,
having a single strategic objective for all its divisions.
   This is understandable. The party was, and remains, the backbone
of the command-administrative system.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The symbol of the anti-Communist
revolution, President Vaclav Havel has built enormous power and
popularity since taking office. Much of the public following is
genuine veneration, but critics say a ``cult of personality'' is
growing that Havel does too little to control.
   After his fairy-tale progression from prison to the presidency
last year, Havel has become a national father figure, particularly
for his fellow Czechs, who make up two-thirds of the 15.5 million
people in Czechoslovakia.
   Now he has led his Civic Forum to victory in the country's first
free elections in more than four decades.
   In Prague, a stronghold of the Civic Forum movement Havel
founded to lead the revolution, pictures and buttons of the
president are everywhere.
   Havel himself complained in late April that his popularity had
reached such extremes that he could no longer say, for instance,
that he disliked a passing dog. If he did, he said, he would find
five people ready to shoot the animal.
   But some critics who have observed Havel closely before and
after he took office say the president has developed a tangible
taste for power and does too little to discourage such veneration.
   ``We have a new cult of personality,'' said an ex-dissident who
asked not to be identified because of past loyalty to Havel. ``He
has always relied on friendly opinions around him ... there is too
little criticism.''
   After taking office, Havel appointed friends, mostly fellow
dissidents, to influential positions at the castle that dominates
Prague's skyline.
   Fellow dissident Jiri Kanturek took over state television, and
another fellow dissident, Petr Uhl, the state news agency CTK.
Civic Forum sympathizers control key ministries and institutions
such as the state prosecutor's office.
   Nobody suggests that such people are anything but democratic and
admirable for their courage in fighting communism.
   On Sunday, however, TV viewers waiting to watch their World Cup
soccer team crush the United States 5-1 were treated to the third
broadcast in four months of the star-studded tribute to Havel when
he visited New York.
   Czechoslovakia's soccer captain, Ivan Hasek, dedicated the World
Cup victory to Civic Forum and to Havel personally.
   Such reverence, and the Czechoslovak media's reluctance to
criticize Havel, stem in part from the lack of free expression
during four decades of Communist rule and the Nazi domination
before that.
   Journalists say they also think twice about writing critical
articles because, in the new climate of free market competition,
newspapers must worry about the readership loss that might result.
   Vladimir Mlynar, a writer for the Lidove Noviny independent
daily, said an article he wrote criticizing the practice of closing
streets for Havel's motorcade drew mixed letters.
   ``Some said, `Thank God someobody is saying it,''' he said.
``Others criticized, asking `How dare you attack our idol?'''
   The overwhelming victory for Civic Forum and its Slovak ally
Public Against Violence was in large measure a personal endorsement
of Havel. But Havel broke the tradition of a non-partisan president
by openly campaigning for his political allies.
   In other respects, Havel openly evokes the president who molded
that non-partisan tradition _ Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, founder of
Czechoslovakia in 1918 and president until 1935.
   Presidential spokesman Michael Zantovsky, asked about Havel's
popularity, said it was to some extent inevitable.
   ``This is a new-found nation ... which looks for
self-confidence,'' he said. ``Just as something close to a cult of
personality was built around Masaryk after independence in 1918, so
we see the same kind of thing happening.''
   But Havel also cultivates the comparison.
   He loves to frequent the country residence built for Masaryk in
Lany, 30 miles west of Prague, the town where the Masaryk family is
buried. Havel addresses the nation each Sunday by radio in a
program called ``Conversations From Lany.''
   A Czech television journalist who has watched Havel closely said
the president has yet to succumb to the ``cult of personality.''
   By contrast, he said, those around the president tend to be too
uncritical.
   ``If ... he keeps on relying on friendly advice rather than real
expertise, he may pay dearly for this,'' said the journalist, who
like some others spoke on condition of anonymity because he said he
feared for his job.
   Zantovsky said the press shouldn't be so cautious. ``We need
people who are willing to go public and criticize whatever aspect
of Havel's activities they don't like,'' he said.
   While willing to accept criticism, Havel is not above using his
power and influence.
   He now says, for example, that he will run for re-election only
if he can appoint a government serving the national interest.
   Given his enormous popularity at home and abroad, the threat of
not running exerts powerful pressure for a government molded to
please Havel. The young democracy identified with Havel would
suffer from the political turmoil and lack of foreign aid that
might result from his resignation.

   When Eskimo whaling crews on the Arctic
Ocean want to determine the weather, they scan the sky, study the
ice, test the wind and observe the currents. Then they might turn
on the radio for the whaling forecast.
   The National Weather Service this spring bought a VHF radio
transmitter to broadcast forecasts at least three times daily for
whalers out on the ice near Barrow.
   ``It's additional safety. It's made quite a difference,'' said
Eugene Brower, president of the Barrow Whaling Captains
Association. ``The old and the new work together. It's just more
refined.''
   Until this spring, the weather service had sent its whaling
forecasts on citizens band radio, which whalers complained
frequently was interrupted or fuzzy. VHF signals, usually used for
shipping and aviation, offer much better reception and range.
   The whaling captains met last year with the service's Barrow
station manager, Chuck Evans, and offered to buy a VHF transmitter
for direct communications with crews on the ice.
   The weather service liked the idea enough that it decided to pay
for the radio, Evans said. The radio can transmit as far as 50
miles from Barrow.
   Floating ice, strong currents, high winds and fog are the main
dangers to whalers.
   ``If the wind blows the ice wrong, it could trap the boats and
crush them,'' Evans said. ``If we see anything that's unusual or
could be a hazard to them, then we broadcast more frequently.''
   The whalers keep the radios at their camps on the ice, Brower
said, and find the extended forecasts, predicting weather for the
next few days, most helpful.
   ``It's insurance _ they haven't been wrong,'' he said. ``Before,
we used to have some doubts, but this spring they've been right on
the money _ rain, snow, how strong the wind is, ice conditions.''
   Eskimo whalers still use ancient forecasting methods as well, he
said, ``things that we have observed over time.''
   ``Some of the old-timers would look at the sun, the moon and let
us know what's happening,'' said Brower. ``We've never learned the
full knowledge they had.''
   The Eskimo spring whaling season usually starts in mid-April and
runs through May as the whales head for their summer feeding
grounds.
   The fall season begins in August when the bowheads migrate
south, past the Arctic Slope and through the Bering Strait.
   Although commercial whaling is banned, Eskimos are allowed to
hunt a limited number of whales for their own use. The
International Whaling Commission sets annual quotas; this year's
quota for the seven Eskimo spring whaling villages is 44 bowhead
whales, 12 of those for Barrow.
   More than half that total has been reached.
   No Eskimos have died while whaling in recent years, Brower said,
but some crews lost their camps and equipment in 1988 when the ice
broke up.
   ``We have a lot of respect for the moving ice out there,'' he
said.
   Eventually, the weather service hopes whalers will give
forecasters a better grasp of Arctic weather, Evans said.
   ``They listen to what we've got, compare it with what they know,
and they go with it,'' said Evans.
   ``We can tell them all kinds of information and that's not going
to change their minds. It's the knowledge they have of the ice that
matters.''

<HEAD>Shamir's Hardline Government: Faces Credibility Problems</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has pledged to
make peace a top priority of his new right-wing government, but he
faces a major task in convincing Arab enemies he is not a ``monster
seeking war.''
   In an apparent effort to allay Washington's fears, Shamir and
leading political allies have softened rhetoric about
settlement-building that U.S. policy considers an obstacle to peace.
   Officials of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc suggest their new
government, which won parliamentary approval on Monday, will move
quickly to improve ties with the Bush administration.
   They acknowledge that Israel's new government has an image
problem.
   Yossi Olmert, director of the Government Press Office, said,
``We are concerned. We are aware of it, and we shall strive to
explain what the government is all about.''
   ``There is more flexibility in this government than meets the
eye,'' he added.
   David Levy, the new foreign minister, was housing minister in
the last government and approved granting $1.8 million in state
funds to start a new settlement during Easter Week in the Christian
quarter of Jerusalem's old city.
   But he told reporters his first task as foreign minister would
be ``to prevent deterioration and to improve'' Israel's strained
ties with the United States.
   Harry Wall, Israel director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'Nai B'Rith, said the government would act to reassure concerned
U.S. Jews that it is not extremist.
   ``It will have to try harder to disabuse the critics who think
that this regime will not push the peace process...the important
thing will be to watch what it does and not what is said.''
   Palestinians, however, plainly do not believe a right-wing
government will make any sincere move toward starting negotiations.
   They see Shamir as a politician who opposed the peace treaty
with Egypt, Levy as the man whose reign as housing minister
resulted in creation of most of the 130 existing settlements in the
occupied territories and Ariel Sharon, the new immigration czar, as
the man who launched a war against Palestinians in Lebanon.
   In a leaflet, the underground leadership of the 30-month
Palestinian uprising noted that Shamir's government relied for
support on the two-seat Moledet, or Homeland, party which advocates
the expulsion of all Arabs.
   It called for an escalation of anti-Israeli protests to ``burn
the ground under the feet of the occupation's army and settlers.''
   Faisal Husseini, a leading Palestinian activist in Jerusalem,
said: ``I think it is a government of war, and I think the
decisions of such a government will be a decision of war.''
   Elias Freij, the moderate mayor of the West Bank town of
Bethlehem, predicted a new wave of settlement building, saying
``Israeli bulldozers are much more dangerous than armored tanks.''
   Others predicted a new wave of arrests aimed at leading
activists and the possible closing of Arabic-language newspapers,
which right-wingers have accused of inciting anti-Israel violence.
   The daily al-Quds newspaper, which reflects pro-PLO views, said
Shamir's peacemaking efforts would not be credible because Likud
and other right-wing parties opposed yielding any war-won land.
   ``How can Shamir's government program talk about peace while on
the other hand rejecting the principle of land for peace...What
kind of peace is Shamir talking about?''
   The new government guidelines, in addition to advocating new
settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, appear to
kill any chances that Israel will now adopt Secretary of State
James A. Baker III's proposals for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue
in Cairo.
   For example, they rule out any participation of Palestinians
from Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem from participating in elections
proposed for the occupied territories, which Israel seized in the
1967 Middle East war.
   Shamir, speaking to Likud bloc members Sunday, said that ``the
instigators among our enemies want to present us as a monster
seeking war. We shall not respond to them in their language. We
shall talk peace to all the world.''
   In his address to parliament on Monday, Shamir hinted that he
would seek a new process that focuses on Egypt taking a more active
role and on reviving the Camp David plan for establishing limited
autonomy for Palestinians in occupied areas.
   ``The time has come for Egypt to stop maneuvering between an
inclination for peace and the Arab elements devoted to
uncompromising hatred,'' Shamir said.
   Political scientist Gabi Sheffer, director of the Leonard Davis
Institute at Hebrew University, said there was little hope for a
serious peace effort because the right wing wants to annex the West
Bank rather than use it as a bargaining chip.
   ``A new initiative will be sought, but I have difficulties in
seeing how it can be a serious one. The situation has reached a
stage where Israel must talk with the Palestinians. But I can't see
this government doing it,'' he said.

   When it comes to worms, Wayne Fauser
is all business _ even at the dinner table.
   He stocks more than 10 million worms on his three Adelaide-based
farms for his company, Fauser All States Worms Pty. Ltd., which has
grown into one of the largest worm farms in the country since its
1985 inception.
   And at the risk of eating into his profits, Fauser also consumes
worms in great quantity _ in sandwiches, omelettes and just about
any food that can contain meat.
   ``They're a great source of protein, and they taste great,'' he
said Monday as he snacked on an overflowing worm sandwich.
   The worms must be fed a diet of dough for 48 hours before being
cooked.
   ``Then they're all right for all sorts of dishes,'' Fauser said.
``I'm sure they will eventually be on Adelaide menus.''
   As an easy meal, he suggests: Dice and fry an onion in a frying
pan, add live worms and two cups of minced pork or beef. Fry until
cooked. Add a can of tomatoes, chopped red pepper, salt and
seasoning. Just before serving, sprinkle with cheese. The end
result is a meal for two.

<HEAD>Top Royal Opera Tickets To Exceed $170 Next Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top ticket prices at the Royal Opera House will
exceed $170 for the first time next season, the financially
struggling company says.
   Beginning in September, opera tickets at the theater in Covent
Garden will jump on average by 17 percent while ballet seats will
rise 25 percent, the company announced Monday.
   The decision to raise prices comes as the theater struggles with
an accumulated deficit of about $8.5 million. The company projects
a deficit of $3.4 million this season.
   ``Even in a perfect world our ticket prices would have to rise
to keep pace with inflation,'' said Jeremy Isaacs, general director
of the Royal Opera House. ``We have taken these steps with
reluctance in order to sustain rather than reduce our service to
our audiences.''
   Prices for 12 of the 126 upcoming opera performances will range
from $5 for seats in the upper balcony, to $172 for the house's
best seats. The most expensive ticket last season was $153.
   For 12 performances, including Joan Sutherland's farewell
appearance in ``Die Fledermaus'' and operas starring Jose Carreras
and Placido Domingo, ticket prices will range from $10 to $190.
   Ballet tickets will cost from $2.55 to $83.
   ``Even at these prices, subscription sales are as high as
ever,'' said opera spokesman Ewen Balfour.

   Texas _ a major center for oil drilling,
refining and transportation _ isn't ready for the mammoth spill in
the Gulf of Mexico that could come from a supertanker burning
offshore, a state official said Monday.
   ``This is our worst nightmare,'' said Land Commissioner Garry
Mauro, who serves on the Governor's Oil Spill Advisory Committee.
``We're not ready to deal with a catastrophic oil spill off the
coast.''
   But Gov. Bill Clements disagreed, saying, ``Texas is hoping and
praying that the worst doesn't happen. But if it does, we'll be
ready.
   ``Because of the potential for a major oil spill, state
government has been put on alert. The state is taking each and
every precaution possible,'' Clements said. ``Protecting our
environment is paramount.''
   By midday, the tanker Mega Borg had spilled up to 100,000
gallons of its 38 million-gallon cargo of light crude oil, the
Coast Guard estimated. The nearly 886-foot-long ship's aft remained
above water but waves occasionally washed over it, slightly
increasing the chance it could sink, the Coast Guard said.
   The Norwegian ship has been on fire since an explosion Saturday
while it transferred cargo 57 miles southeast of Galveston.
   The response to the disaster was delayed during the weekend as
firefighting and oil containment equipment was brought in from
Louisiana, Alabama and even the Netherlands, Coast Guard officials
said.
   At a news conference Monday, Coast Guard Adm. Williams Merlin
said private salvage and containment companies responding to the
fire had equipment stationed elsewhere because there are more
offshore fires in the North Sea and the Middle East than in the
gulf.
   Little of the specialized equipment exists in the world, and the
Coast Guard does not determine where it is assigned, Merlin said.
The Coast Guard supervises cleanups, but they usually are funded by
ship owners who hire private contractors to do the work.
   ``This is free enterprise at work,'' Merlin said. ``The salvage
companies that operate in this area find more business overseas
than they do here.
   ``We would love to have all that (equipment) ... immediately
available,'' he said.
   The Coast Guard is satisfied that the Mega Borg's owner,
Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway, is acting responsibly and
professionally, Merlin said.
   Texas ports handle 300 million tons of cargo each year, 75
percent of it crude oil or petroleum products, according to Mauro.
   The commissioner criticized the state for failing to have a plan
for dealing with disasters like the Mega Borg fire.
   ``There is no plan to deal with 38 million gallons of oil on the
water,'' he said. ``Anything that happens to deal with this crisis
is going to be a make-do emergency plan. And the chances of a major
catastrophe occurring are much higher as a result of no plan.''
   However, other state officials said the response has gone well
so far.
   ``Time and good weather have been on our side,'' said state
Emergency Management Coordinator Robert Lansford.
   Texas Water Commission Chairman Buck Wynne said the state can
better respond to shippng disasters thanks to a recent drill that
simulated a 200,000-gallon oil spill in the gulf.
   ``Hopefully, we've identified problems in coordinating a
response to a major oil spill,'' said Wynne, whose agency is part
of a regional response team that includes the Coast Guard and other
federal agencies.
   ``I think we are as ready as we can be,'' he said.
   Mauro said Texas deals well with small spills, but is not ready
for a large one.
   He recommends that the state consolidate oil spill emergency
planning in one agency instead of the current five; buy and deploy
cleanup equipment along the Gulf Coast and get more federal
equipment placed in Texas.
   Clements said putting more equipment along the Texas coast has
been debated.
   ``It's terribly expensive equipment, and a lot of people are
involved,'' he said. ``You never seem to have the people and
equipment where the problem arises.''

   A Supreme Court decision to overturn a flag
protection law is a political gift to Republican conservatives who
have seen some of their best themes blunted by events beyond their
reach.
   President Bush waved the flag with great skill in the last
election, although the top issues for Republicans in the 1980s were
taxes and defense.
   But the upheaval in Central and Eastern Europe has taken the
steam out of the advocates of continuing the U.S. military buildup.
   Then, Bush opened the door to a tax increase as part of his
budget summit with Congress _ blurring partisan lines.
   In addition, the Supreme Court's ruling last year expanding
states' power over abortion has proven electorally difficult for
many in the GOP.
   If the court had upheld the anti-flag-burning statute Congress
approved last year, that issue too would have been pushed into the
political background.
   But Monday, the court cooperated in a way that will force the
Democratic-controlled Congress to decide straight-up on a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. Democrats had dodged
an amendment last fall by passing the law protecting the flag, only
to see that political cover taken from them with this 5-4 ruling.
   Congressional Republicans want to stand up and salute.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., wasted no time defining
the upcoming vote as a test of patriotism.
   ``I happened to be at Arlington Cemetery on Memorial Day and
some stranger asked me why don't they bring the flag burners out
here'' to see the graves, he said.
   ``I'll place my money on the young men and young women who serve
in America's armed services. The rest can place their money'' with
the flag burners, he said.
   ``There are those of us who've fought for that flag, and regard
it as a precious national symbol,'' said House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   For Democrats opposed to the amendment the issue is undoubtedly
a loser. They were left arguing Monday that the issue shouldn't be
made partisan and taken alone isn't enough to defeat any of their
candidates this fall.
   House and Senate Democratic leaders seem ready to bring the
matter up quickly, which could help minimize the political impact
and give supporters less time to whip up passions anew.
   Democrats, their own ranks divided on the issue, attacked
Republicans for trying to take advantage.
   ``To drag the flag through cheap politics is every bit as
offensive as burning it,'' said Democratic National Chairman Ron
Brown.
   But Republicans made clear they were in no mood to give
Democrats a free ride.
   ``I think it's a good value-defining issue,'' said Ed Rollins,
co-chairman of the House GOP's campaign committee. ``If your
opponent is for flag burning, then he's got to go through a very
sophisticated explanation of why he is.''
   Wendy DeMocker, spokeswoman for the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee, rattled off her select list of Democratic
incumbents who voted against the constitutional amendment last
year, when it was rejected.
   She included Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.;
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa; Paul Simon, D-Ill.; and Carl Levin, D-Mich. _
all of whom now have strong Republican challengers in this year's
elections.
   Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, said the issue won't work because ``every
member is for protecting the flag, honoring the flag. There is no
member of the House of Representatives who is saying, `Let's burn
the flag.'''
   ``What this means is they're desperate for anything that comes
along,'' Schloss said. ``If this is the only issue for them,
they're in trouble.''
   Schloss said Democrats who vote against the constitutional
amendment would successfully defend their positions and then move
on to important issues, such as education, the environment and the
economy.
   But the Democrats won't be able to keep the lid on the political
rhetoric.
   Bush, who used the news media and flag issue effectively in his
1988 campaign, is already planning to beat the drum as he campaigns
around the country for GOP House and Senate candidates. Republicans
hope it will help them in their quest to upset enough Democrats to
take control of the Senate for the first time since 1980.
   When the issue was hot last year, Democrats said they returned
to their home districts and found voters were less concerned about
the flag issue than other things.
   But that was when it appeared a simple statute _ the one thrown
out Monday _ might suffice.
   It also wasn't an election year, when a complex legal issue can
be boiled down to us-or-them simplicity. As Dole said Monday, ``It
would make a good 30-second spot.''

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's 5-4
decision Monday that overturned the federal law banning flag
burning.
   The opinion of the court was written by Justice William J.
Brennan. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the dissent.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From the majority opinion:
   The government's interest in protecting the ``physical
integrity'' of a privately owned flag rests upon a perceived need
to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of our nation and certain
national ideals. But the mere destruction or disfigurement of a
particular physical manifestation of the symbol, without more, does
not diminish or otherwise affect the symbol itself in any way. ...
   The government's interest cannot justify its infringement on
First Amendment rights. We decline the government's invitation to
reassess this conclusion in light of Congress' recent recognition
of a purported ``national consensus'' favoring a prohibition on
flag-burning. ... Even assuming such a consensus exists, any
suggestion that the government's interest in suppressing speech
becomes more weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is
foreign to the First Amendment.
   ... Government may create national symbols, promote them, and
encourage their respectful treatment. But the Flag Protection Act
goes well beyond this by criminally proscribing expressive conduct
because of its likely communicative impact.
   We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to
many. But the same might be said, for example, of virulent ethnic
and religious epithets, vulgar repudiations of the draft, and
scurrilous caricatures. ... Punishing desecration of the flag
dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and
worth revering.
   
   From the dissent:
   The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality and
tolerance _ ideas that Americans have passionately defended and
debated throughout our history. The flag embodies the spirit of our
national commitment to those ideals.
   ... The flag is a reminder both that the struggle for liberty
and equality is unceasing, and that our obligation of tolerance and
respect for all of our fellow citizens encompasses those who
disagree with us _ indeed, even those whose ideas are disagreeable
or offensive.
   Thus, the government may _ indeed, it should _ protect the
symbolic value of the flag without regard to the specific content
of the flag burners' speech. ...
   ... The prohibition does not entail any interference with the
speaker's freedom to express his or her ideas by other means. It
may well be true that other means of expression may be less
effective in drawing attention to those ideas, but that is not
itself a sufficient reason for immunizing flag burning.
   ... The freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment
embraces not only the freedom to communicate particular ideas, but
also the right to communicate them effectively. That right,
however, is not absolute _ the communicative value of a well-placed
bomb in the Capitol does not entitle it to the protection of the
First Amendment.
   ... The integrity of the symbol has been compromised by those
leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the flag even by
individuals whom it offends, or who seem to manipulate the symbol
of national purpose into a pretext for partisan disputes about
meaner ends.

   Here is a chronology of events involving the
Supreme Court's decisions on flag-burning and efforts to reinstate
penalties for desecration.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1989</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   June 21 _ The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, declares that
burning the American flag as a form of political protest is
constitutionally protected free speech, saying, ``We do not
consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration.'' The defendant
in the case, Gregory Johnson, had burned the flag at the 1984
Republican Convention in Dallas.
   
   June 22 _ Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., introduces a proposed
constitutional amendment ``to protect the dignity of the U.S.
flag.'' A flag-burning is reported in Berkeley, Calif. President
Bush tells a New York audience, ``Flag burning is wrong _ dead
wrong.''
   
   June 23 _ The Senate passes legislation to outlaw flag
desecration. The sponsor, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., says he is
confident the measure is constitutional. House Speaker Thomas
Foley, D-Wash., says changing the Constitution should be viewed
with caution.
   
   June 26 _ President Bush's spokesman says Bush supports
legislation to restore criminal penalties for flag desecration but
hadn't decided whether to back a constitutional amendment to
overturn the Supreme Court decision.
   
   June 27 _ Bush calls for a constitutional amendment to bypass
the Supreme Court ruling, saying, ``I will uphold our precious
right to dissent, but burning the flag goes too far.'' The House
approves a resolution expressing ``profound concern'' over the
court decision.
   
   June 29 _ Bush and congressional Republicans agree on a proposed
constitutional amendment. House members hold an all-night
speechmaking session on the flag issue in an empty chamber.
   
   July 13 _ Congress opens hearings on the flag-burning issue,
with conservatives seeking a constitutional amendment but Democrats
backing a change in law instead.
   
   July 27 _ The House Judiciary Committee approves a
flag-protection bill over Republican objections that it wouldn't
overcome the Supreme Court decision.
   
   Aug. 10 _ The American Bar Association's policy-making body
votes to oppose a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration.
   
   Sept. 12 _ The House votes 380-38 to approve legislation
restoring criminal penalties for flag-burning.
   
   Sept. 21 _ The Senate Judiciary Committee approves a proposed
flag bill and disapproves a constitutional amendment but sends both
to the floor for action.
   
   Oct. 15 _ The Senate approves a flag desecration bill 91-9. Bush
says he respects ``the intention'' but still will seek a
constitutional amendment.
   
   Oct. 12 _ The House votes final approval for the flag bill,
371-43. The next day, Bush says he'll allow the bill to become law
without his signature.
   
   Oct. 19 _ The Senate defeats an anti-flag-burning constitutional
amendment, with the 51-48 vote falling 16 votes short of the
two-thirds majority needed for passage.
   
   Oct. 28 _ The flag desecration law takes effect, and minutes
later a Seattle crowd torches a pile of American flags, chanting
``burn, baby, burn.'' Four people were arrested. Flag burnings
occur in other cities in following days, and three people were
charged with burning a flag on the U.S. Capitol steps on Oct. 30.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1990</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   
   Feb. 21 _ A federal judge in Seattle rules the flag desecration
law is unconstitutional.
   
   March 5 _ A federal judge in Washington D.C. rules the law is
unconstitutional. The law provides for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court.
   
   May 14 _ The Supreme Court hears arguments on the new flag
desecration law.
   
   June 11 _ The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 split identical to that in
the 1989 ruling, strikes down the new federal law that outlaws
burning the American flag. It says the ban ``dilutes the very
freedom that makes this emblem so revered.''

   Here is the legal status of key figures in the
Iran-Contra affair:
   _John M. Poindexter, former national security adviser, convicted
April 7 of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two
counts of making false statements in connection with Reagan
administration assistance to the Contras and a November 1985
shipment of missiles to Iran. He was sentenced Monday to six months
in prison.
   _Oliver L. North, former National Security Council aide, found
guilty in May 1989 of three felonies _ aiding and abetting the
obstruction of Congress, destroying official documents and
accepting an illegal gratuity _ and sentenced to two years'
probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service. He is appealing while serving the community
service in an anti-drug program.
   _Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded
guilty to four misdemeanors of withholding information from
Congress by denying that the NSC staff was soliciting support for
the Contras' military activities and helping move supplies to the
rebels and denying that he knew anything about other-country
financing of the Contras. Was placed on two years' probation, fined
$20,000 and sentenced to 200 hours of community service.
   _Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded
guilty Nov. 8 to lying to congressional investigators when he said
he wasn't aware of any money that went to the benefit of North from
the maze of companies known as ``the enterprise,'' which Secord had
used in the Iran-Contra affair. Secord on Jan. 24 was sentenced to
two years' probation.
   _Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, pleaded guilty to using his non-profit
National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty to raise more
than $2 million to buy weapons for the Nicaraguan rebels. Sentenced
to two years probation for conspiring to defraud the Treasury of
taxes due on the money raised with North's assistance. He died last
month.
   _Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations company,
pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue
Service of taxes on contributions used to supply military aid to
the Nicaraguan Contras. Sentenced to two years' probation.
   _Albert Hakim, Iranian-born businessman who with Secord ran
``the enterprise,'' pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of aiding and
abetting in supplementing North's income by paying for a security
fence at North's home. Hakim was fined $5,000 and sentenced to two
years probation Feb. 1. He agreed to forgo his claims on more than
$7 million in profits from the Reagan administration's Iran arms
sales. Also, a company he set up, Lake Resources, pleaded guilty to
theft of government property in connection with Iran arms sale
money diverted from the U.S. government. The judge ordered that
company dissolved.
   _Joseph Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica,
charged with obstruction and making false statements in connection
with his assistance to North's Contra resupply network. The judge
in the case said the charges must be dismissed due to the attorney
general's ban on the use of classified material Fernandez needs for
his defense. Iran-Contra prosecutors are appealing.
   _Former CIA agent Thomas Clines, indicted for allegedly failing
to report some of his income to the Internal Revenue Service that
he received for working for North's Contra resupply network.
Clines, a business partner of Secord and Hakim, has pleaded
innocent and is scheduled to go on trial Sept. 4 in U.S. District
Court in Baltimore. Clines located a European arms dealer as a
source of weapons for the Contras and helped arrange for shipping
and lined up crews to transport the supplies to the rebels.

<HEAD>Man Sent to State Hospital for Universal Studios Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former mental patient who admitted killing
two Universal Studios guards during a hunt for actor Michael Landon
was committed to a state mental hospital Monday.
   On the advice of psychologists, Nicholas Nathan Trupp, 43, was
formally ordered to stay at Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino
County.
   In a plea bargain with prosecutors last month, Trupp admitted to
the 1988 fatal shootings of Jeren Beeks, 27, of La Crescenta and
Armando Torres, 18, of Los Angeles.
   Trupp first entered guilty pleas to second-degree murder, but
Superior Court Judge Clarence A. Stromwell accepted his second plea
of innocent by reason of insanity.
   Authorities in New Mexico, where Trupp was sought for
investigation of killing three people, will not pursue prosecution
of Trupp, said Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Sterling Norris.
   Norris claimed Trupp went to Universal Studios on Dec. 1, 1988,
in search of Landon, who was starring in the television series
``Highway to Heaven.''
   The guards refused Trupp entry and declined to let him use their
phone to call the actor. Trupp left, returned with a shotgun and
killed the guards. He said he believed they were Nazis.
   Deputy Public Defender Steven Hobson has said that Trupp, who is
Jewish and spent time in Israel in his youth, remains obsessed
about Nazis and says he hears voices as well as God telling him to
do things.
   Trupp has had mental problems since age 13, Hobson said. He was
committed to a Trenton, N.J., psychiatric hospital in 1987, but was
released to a supervised boarding house after a court ruled he
posed no threat. He walked away from the boarding house in April
1988.

<TEXT>
   If playing a practical joke is your idea of
fun, but exploding cigars and whoopee cushions have lost their
charm, it's time to summon Tom Antion and his merry pranksters.
   Antion is a jovial, 34-year-old professional trickster and
founder of Prankmasters, a company based in his brick rambler home
in suburban New Carrollton, Md., that does a booming business in
custom-designed practical jokes for all occasions.
   Good-natured embarrassment is Antion's stock in trade. ``Our
motto is, whatever we do for you will be remembered forever,'' says
Antion, whose business card features an impudent red devil sticking
out his tongue.
   One bride and groom won't soon forget Antion and partner Bonnie
Lichtman, who appeared at the wedding reception as ``a nerd couple
from West Virginia'' who carried the invitation of a fun-loving
couple who couldn't make the festivities.
   Antion wore white socks and a red paisley dinner jacket over a
Hawaiian sports shirt. He scarfed dinner rolls from the banquet
tables, gawked at the chandeliers and wormed his way into every
photo taken for the wedding album.
   He may be remembered forever _ but not exactly with affection _
by the owner of a fancy hairstyling salon whose friends called at
the last minute to request a birthday surprise.
   Antion appeared at the door with Freeway, his 50-pound pet
mongrel, and complained irately that the dog's missing patches of
fur had resulted from a badly botched perm at the salon the day
before.
   ``I said, `This is a show dog. Just look at his coat.' Freeway,
who is totally untrained, was running around in circles. I said,
`Look how upset he is. He knows he's got a show tomorrow.' I
demanded they ship me a canine toupee kit by express mail or I'd
sue.
   ``They were thinking, this guy's really from outer space. There
was a stunned silence until I came back with the birthday balloons
and started singing,'' he said.
   Antion charges $19.95 for an imposter's ``teleprank'' to perhaps
$1,000 for a more elaborate scheme. One of his costliest involved
fooling a Wall Street investment banker into believing that one of
his Midwestern nursing homes had bilked a little old lady who was
suing him for $12 million.
   ``He was sweating bullets,'' Antion said. ``His friends on the
board of directors let him suffer for a very long day.''
   Antion maintains a stable of three dozen paid accomplices,
including several midgets, a striptease artist who performs in a
gorilla suit and a 450-pound man who delivers ``moon-a-grams'' with
comic messages scribbled across his exposed backside.
   A native of rural Claysville, Pa., Antion entertained himself as
a child by playing practical jokes. After graduating from West
Virginia University, he ran a nightclub in Morgantown, W.Va., for
several years. It was an unhappy experience.
   ``I was always dealing in misery,'' he said. ``People were
getting drunk. There were knife fights and fistfights. I was
throwing people out the door and getting sued. I decided that when
I got out of there, I'd be dealing in happiness instead of
sadness.''
   Inspired by his nightclub sideline of delivering party balloons
and novelty telegrams, Antion moved to Washington to ``make money
and have fun.'' He established Prankmasters three years ago, and
says ``it's going great guns.''
   One of his favorite pranks was played on a young woman having
dinner in a penthouse restaurant with her boyfriend, who'd hired
Antion to appear as a secret government courier.
   Antion sat at their table, put on white gloves and opened the
briefcase shackled to his wrist. ``I pulled out a love telegram,
and she started laughing,'' he said. ``Then I pulled out an
engagement ring, and her boyfriend asked her to marry him. She
burst into tears.''
   Added Antion: ``I got into this business to make people happy,
and she was happy that day. I hope she said yes.''

   A 38-year-old man
convicted of illegally harvesting crabs seized five court officials
as hostages on Monday before shooting it out six hours later with
police, police said.
   A police officer and the gunman were wounded in the incident,
and the hostages _ four sheriffs and a court interpreter _ escaped
unharmed, said Casey Dehaas, a spokesman for the New Westminster
police.
   Police said the gunman was shot in the upper body and was
hospitalized in serious condition. The police officer suffered a
slight head wound.
   Police said the hostage-taker, who was not identified, had gone
to court to appeal a three-month sentence for violating
crab-fishing regulations and a three-month sentence for obstructing
justice.
   The federal regulations prohibit harvesting of Dungeness crabs
smaller than seven inches or red rock crabs smaller than five
inches.
   While in the lockup area of the courthouse, the man somehow
seized the hostages.
   Police believe the gunman had smuggled a handgun into the
courthouse.
   A police officer negotiated with the hostage-taker using the
courthouse's internal phone system.
   Dehaas said the gunman was born in China and did not speak
English.
   Six hours after the hostages were seized more than dozen shots
were heard.
   It was unclear who opened fire first, or under what
circumstances.

<TEXT>
   A change in government style is promised for
Singapore when Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, a benevolent but stern
patriarch, steps aside after 31 robust years.
   Plans call for First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to take
over later this year, sometime after Sept. 16, when Lee turns 67.
   Goh, 48, was named to the No. 2 post in 1985. Using a
consultative leadership style, Goh says he expects to preside over
a more open society with the goal of making Singapore a ``great
small nation.''
   Lee is not passing completely from the scene, however, and his
influence is expected to remain intact. Goh intends to have him in
the Cabinet as a senior minister without portfolio.
   ``Those who believe that when I have left the government as
prime minister that I've gone into permanent retirement really
should have their heads examined,'' he once told a gathering of his
People's Action Party.
   ``Even from my sick bed, even if you are going to lower me into
the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I'll get up.''
   The Cambridge-educated lawyer took charge in 1959. Modern
Singapore began its independent existence with no resources, no
industry, bitter racial divisions and potentially unfriendly
neighbors.
   Lee helped forge an identity for this polyglot place, uniting
with sizeable Malay and Indian minorities an ethnic Chinese
majority regarded with suspicion by its Moslem neighbors in
Malaysia and Indonesia.
   He demanded discipline to overcome hardships. Obedience, hard
work, cleanliness, thrift and the profit motive all came into play
as a shabby British colonial outpost was transformed.
   Now its a flourishing banking and commercial center with
high-tech industries, first-class education and glitzy shopping
centers.
   Lee's government enjoys a reputation for honesty, efficiency and
a strong sense of direction. Standards are high and there is a
strict moral code. Tipping, jaywalking, littering, discourtesy and
failing to flush public toilets after use are officially denounced.
Those suspected of more serious transgressions such as subversion
and drug abuse _ 28 convicted traffickers have been hanged _ can
expect no mercy.
   In recent years, Lee's dominance over national affairs has been
largely accepted as the justifiable means to an end that benefited
most Singaporeans.
   ``We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think,''
he once said. More than half Singapore's 2.7 million people were
born during Lee's tenure and more than 80 percent have had no other
leader during their adult lives.
   Those who would challenge that leadership found themselves
subject to arrest, detention without trial, public humiliation and
general harassment by a government reluctant to acknowledge dissent.
   Lee said several years ago that his political heirs sometimes
did not seem tough enough to keep the opposition and other critics
in their place. He nevertheless planned an orderly transfer of
power to a new generation.
   In 1988, he admitted publicly that he preferred Education
Minister Tony Tan instead of the easygoing Goh as his successor.
Tan did not aspire to the post.
   Goh told the party faithful in April that he stands for
continuity, not change. But he also said he expects to run a more
open administration offering participation, accommodation and
consensus.
   Participation means involving as many as practicable in the
political process, Goh said. Painting a picture of a kinder,
gentler Singapore, he said participation involved ``understanding
their hopes and aspirations, their fears and tribulations, and
helping them to realize their hopes and overcome their fears ...
   ``More than just listening to their views, I also want to give
the people more opportunity to choose and decide for themselves,
instead of letting government agencies make most of the decisions
that often have to be applied uniformly.''
   Goh recently visited Washington, London and other capitals to
introduce himself. Lee has been touring separately to say farewell
to foreign friends and offer his views on the transition.
   ``I could not get good men to join me if they're going to hang
around and wait for me to go senile,'' Lee said in London. ``I've
got a very competent and dedicated group, fully able to run the
country and in fact have been doing so for the last four years with
minimal overview from me.''
   Lee has accurately described his role as that of ``chairman'' of
Singapore, Inc., a 240-square-mile city-state run on corporate
lines. Ministers act as executive directors, largely untroubled by
ideological issues or domestic political infighting. They are
chosen less for their electoral appeal than their capacity to
manage a department effectively.
   Lee's eldest son, Trade and Industry Minister Lee Hsien Loong,
37, is already acknowledged by Goh as his logical successor as
prime minister.

<HEAD>Hundreds Found Dodging Limits on Subsidy Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Department watchdogs says hundreds
of farmers are still dodging the limits on federal subsidies, some
with intricate schemes going back several years.
   A semiannual report by the department's Office of Inspector
General said auditors have been reporting the abuses since 1985.
   Generally, the payments are limited to $50,000 per ``person''
annually. But a person can be an individual, a joint stock company,
a corporation, an association, a trust or some other legal entity.
   ``Over the five-year period, we conducted three major audits and
evaluated 1,644 `person' determinations,'' the report said. ``We
questioned 381 of these `person' determinations where these
producers received or were scheduled to receive excessive program
payments of $21.3 million.''
   Projecting those results, auditors estimated the excessive
payments at more than $126 million.
   In one case used as an example, corporations A and B in 1986
each was one person as defined by the USDA program. In 1987,
corporation B was dissolved and its assets absorbed by partnership
A, consisting of three persons.
   Corporation A, partnership A and a newly created five-person
partnership B were then considered as nine separate ``persons''
under the program.
   ``In actual practice, however, each `person' was linked to the
other through a shared financing arrangement and therefore should
have been reorganized as one entity in 1987,'' the report said.
   ``This arrangement continued into 1988,'' it added. ``The three
entities improperly received deficiency and disaster payments
totaling about $577,000.''
   Program rules for additional ``persons'' were tightened in the
Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987, effective for the 1989 crop
year. However, for 1989 only, the law allowed for equitable farm
reorganization.
   ``Because of this provision, large operators who would have
received reduced payments for 1989 reorganized by selling stock, by
giving stock to new individuals or others who had an interest in
less than three entities, and by creating irrevocable trusts,'' the
report said.
   ``Thus, farm operations were reorganized to earn maximum
payments, and total program costs may not be changed from previous
years,'' the report added. ``Rather, payments will be assigned to
more `persons' created as a result of reorganization.''
   Inspectors said they ``are continuing to evaluate compliance
with the 1987 rules by expanding our audit of reorganizations of
large farms'' enrolled in the USDA programs.
   The report covered the first half of the 1990 fiscal year
through March 31. A wide range of USDA programs and functions was
included.
   Overall, said Deputy Inspector General Leon Snead, during the
six-month period auditors identified about $24 million in
recoveries and collections, and $367 million in commitments by
managers to put funds to better use.
   ``Our investigative efforts resulted in 224 indictments, 368
convictions and about $23 million in fines, restitutions and
recoveries'' during the first half of the fiscal year, Snead
reported.
   The main hunting ground for inspectors looking at program
overpayments is USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service, or ASCS, which has a nationwide network of state and
county offices.
   Financing of the programs is handled by the Commodity Credit
Corp., or CCC, a wholly owned department corporation.
   The report noted many other procedural and fraudulent
infractions relating to commodity programs. A common violation was
the unauthorized disposal of mortgaged property _ grain or other
commodities stored by farmers under price support loan.
   In one case, a Nebraska farmer was accused of converting 25,000
bushels of CCC-mortgaged corn to his own use. The ASCS inspectors
found a black plastic and wire mesh structure covered with a small
amount of corn under the hatches of his bins.
   ``The farmer allegedly rigged the device to give the impression
that the bins were full when ASCS inspected them,'' the report
said. ``Other bins contained bales of hay under the corn. Trial is
pending.''
   Other instances of illegal practices included a rural electric
cooperative manager being convicted to racketeering, conspiracy and
mail fraud; improper use of imported vegetable oil in domestic and
export food donations; and the continuing problems of overpayments
and fraud by some grocers handling food stamps.
   Investigations are also continuing to identify illegal food
stamp recipients through computer matchups.
   ``We conducted the matches to identify federal employees
participating in the (food stamp program) but not reporting wages,
and to identify recipients who are crossing state lines to work but
not reporting wages,'' the report said. ``These matching efforts
are in addition to state matching requirements.''
   Inspectors said more than 400 federal employees and retirees out
of about 9,000 identified by computers were found to be getting
food stamps illegally.
   ``These individuals received program benefits because they had
not reported their federal incomes properly,'' the report said.
   In all, they were found to have received nearly $526,000 in
excessive stamp benefits and more than $650,000 in excessive Aid to
Families with Dependent Children and Medicaid benefits.

<HEAD>Sponsor of National Guard Training Law Lauds Ruling</HEAD>

   A Supreme Court ruling that permits the
federal government to send state National Guard troops abroad for
peacetime training will bar governors from playing politics with
foreign policy, says a member of Congress.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chief sponsor of a 1986
law upheld unanimously by the court on Monday, said the decision is
a relief.
   ``We just couldn't afford to have a few governors play politics
with this issue just because they objected to the foreign policy
objectives of the administration,'' he said.
   The so-called Montgomery Amendment prohibits any governor from
withholding consent to a National Guard unit's active duty outside
the country because of an objection to the location, purpose or
schedule of the duty.
   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota challenged the law in
an appeal supported by several other governors.
   Attorney General Hubert H. Humphrey III of Minnesota said he was
disappointed by the ruling. John Tunheim, a deputy in Humphrey's
office who argued the case before the high court, said he was not
surprised by the decision.
   Tunheim said the ruling is in line with recent decisions
broadening federal powers at the expense of the states.
   In other actions Monday, the court:
   _Ruled, 5-4, that Congress violated free-speech rights when it
outlawed flag burning last year. The decision immediately set off a
new political fight over amending the Constitution to protect the
American flag.
   _Gave police broad new power to stop and question someone based
on anonymous tips. The 6-3 ruling reinstated an Alabama woman's
drug conviction.
   _Ruled, 7-2, that the federal government can cut benefits paid
to recipients who relied on a government worker's incorrect answers
about their eligibility.
   _Refused to let a private Jewish group display a menorah in a
public park near the Burlington, Vt., City Hall.
   _Agreed to study the power of federal prosecutors to seize
sexually explicit material and business records from distributors
of adult books and films.
   Among those who opposed the Montgomery Amendment was Democratic
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, who made federal control
over National Guard troops an issue in his unsuccessful 1988
presidential campaign.
   Dukakis had opposed sending National Guard troops to train in
Central America, denouncing the Reagan administration in 1988 for
what he called a ``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   He said sending National Guard troops to the region was an
attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   The Justice Department had called Dukakis' position ``a dagger
aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   By contrast, Perpich did not criticize Reagan or Bush
administration foreign policy but emphasized states' rights. He
said the Constitution gives states veto power over peacetime
training missions for National Guard members.
   Perpich did not object when 12 members of a Minnesota National
Guard public relations unit happened to be training in Panama last
December when U.S. forces invaded to capture Gen. Manuel Noriega.
The Minnesota troops returned to the United States a day after the
invasion began.
   It was enacted after several governors said they opposed the
Reagan administration's Central American policy and did not want
National Guard troops from their states assigned to training
missions in that region.
   The Bush administration said Perpich's challenge to the federal
law was illogical because the governor did not contest the federal
government's power to order National Guard troops to fight a war
abroad but said the federal government lacked authority to train
the troops for war.
   There has been dual control over the National Guard since
Congress made it a component of the Army in 1933.
   There are some 460,000 men and women in the Army National Guard
and 115,000 in the Air National Guard.
   Anyone joining the National Guard enrolls automatically in a
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national
armed forces.
   The Army National Guard provides 46 percent of the Army's combat
units and 28 percent of its support forces.
   The Air National Guard provides 73 percent of the nation's
interceptor forces, 25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent
of tactical air support.
   Minnesota's appeal was supported by officials from Iowa, Maine,
Massachusetts, Ohio and Vermont. Most other states sided with the
federal government.

   With wisecracks from Willard Scott about another
bald head on the set, Joe Garagiola returned to NBC's ``Today''
show for what it hopes will prove a fresh start after a year of woe.
   Although heavily promoted by NBC during the weekend, the
new-look ``Today'' was low-key Monday as Bryant Gumbel and
co-anchor Deborah Norville welcomed Garagiola, the show's co-host
from 1969 to 1973 and now its second co-anchor.
   Appearing without his toupee, the ebullient Scott kidded
Garagiola about his baldness, joking from Washington, ``I got a
quart of Simonize I'm sending.''
   There were no speeches and no recap by Gumbel of the show's
problems.
   Since anchorwoman Jane Pauley's departure in December after 13
years, once-dominant ``Today'' has been second in ratings to ABC's
``Good Morning America'' for 22 weeks. Its ratings are 17 percent
below last year's.
   Garagiola, a 64-year-old former baseball catcher, was brought
back from semi-retirement in Arizona to add what NBC hopes will be
a sense of warmth and family that translates into higher ratings.

   Dads in TV comedies should show a little more
affection, says Bob Saget of ABC's ``Full House.''
   Saget said he and other fathers in TV comedies are often
insensitive incompetents because the basis for sitcoms is conflict,
and the conflict often comes from the father needing help.
   ``For the show to work, you got to make him a goober
sometimes,'' Saget said in the June 16 issue of TV Guide. ``If the
father's not a bit bumbling and the kids are not on top of it,
where's the comedy?''
   Hal Williams, a father on NBC's ``227,'' said the networks ``add
lighter moments, like a dad who has problems cooking a meal or
changing a diaper or talking about something serious, but I find a
lot of that stuff hard to believe.''

   A recount has been ordered to determine who
won the Democratic nomination for governor because the unofficial
margin of victory in the seven-way primary May 15 was a mere 41
votes for lawyer Ben Nelson.
   The recount, which begins Wednesday, was automatic under state
law because the margin was less than 1 percent of Nelson's
first-place total of 44,556 votes.
   The state Board of Canvassers voted 4-0 on Monday to order the
recount.
   Unofficial returns showed Nelson with a 41-vote lead over Bill
Hoppner, a former aide to U.S. Sen. Bob Kerrey.
   The Democratic nominee will challenge Gov. Kay Orr, the nation's
first Republican woman elected governor, who seeks a second,
four-year term. Mrs. Orr is chairwoman of the election board and
voted for the recount.
   Secretary of State Allen Beermann said it could be a week or
more before the board convenes to certify the results.
   ``Recounting all seven will require some additional time and
expense but we feel the voters want it in consideration of fairness
and accuracy,'' he said.
   The recount will be done by hand in 69 counties that still use
paper ballots and by machine in the 24 others, Beermann said.
   In unofficial returns, former Omaha Mayor Mike Boyle came in
third with 41,226 votes.

   Gov. Bob Martinez signed oil-spill
prevention and cleanup legislation he called the nation's most
comprehensive as a supertanker fire off Texas highlighted the
threat to coastal states.
   ``This legislation puts Florida in a much better position to
deal with an oil spill and even to prevent one from happening in
the first place,'' Martinez said Monday.
   The law, a compromise with oil shippers and retailers, was
prompted by last year's Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska.
   Martinez noted that firefighters were battling to keep a burning
Norwegian supertanker with 38 million gallons of oil from sinking
in the Gulf of Mexico off Galveston, Texas.
   ``These are real problems that do occur,'' Martinez said. ``To
our knowledge, there's not another state in the union that has a
bill of this comprehensive nature dealing with oil spills.
   ``I believe that others will begin to follow suit,'' he said.
``They have coastlines to protect, and the only way to protect is
to be able to immediately respond.''
   Highlights of the law:
   _Vessels and terminals must produce detailed spill-response
plans, and terminals must buy equipment to contain a spill quickly.
   _Only certified pilots or deputy pilots may move large ships in
Florida waters.
   _Where oil and other pollutants are loaded and unloaded in large
quantities, terminal operators will have to use booms to seal off
the waters around the ship in case a spill occurs.
   _Liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs for
transporters and owners of cargo jump from $14 million to $50
million.
   _Fines of up to $25,000 can be assessed if shippers or terminals
fail to meet the law's provisions.
   In addition, if oil drilling is approved off Florida's coast,
the cap on a state spill-cleanup fund will double from $50 million
to $100 million using an existing 2-cent-a-barrel excise tax on oil
and other pollutants.
   If the fund, which now contains $32 million, is depleted by a
major spill, the tax could be increased to 10 cents by the governor
and Cabinet.
   Environmentalists generally praised the law as a positive first
step but said more must be done.
   In particular, the limits on cleanup liability for oil companies
and shippers should be removed, said Ann Whitfield of the Florida
Public Interest Research Group. She noted the $2 billion cost of
the Exxon Valdez spill.
   ``This is a dramatic improvement but it still maintains the
principle that the oil industry should be protected from cleanup
costs,'' she said.
   ``If they were not protected, it would be a financial incentive
for them to have the safety equipment to do the job.''

<TEXT>
   Congress probably will have to approve another
$50 billion savings and loan bailout this year, the Senate Banking
Committee chairman says, but he warns against handing the
administration a blank check.
   In a two-hour speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., said, ``Congress will have to act, probably later
this year, to provide additional funds.
   ``New legislation will be needed to provide new monies ...
probably in amounts comparable to what (the S&amp;L bill) provided last
year,'' he said.
   Riegle's speech followed the dramatic increase last month in the
administration's estimate of the cost of rescuing the thrift
industry.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told Riegle's panel it
would cost between $89 billion and $132 billion. Until then, the
administration had insisted S&amp;L failures mostly could be handled by
$50 billion in long-term borrowing authority provided last year.
   Brady had suggested Congress consider providing ``indefinite
authority'' for the administration to spend whatever it takes to
meet the government's obligation to back insured S&amp;L deposits.
   However, Riegle said, ``I believe the ... blank check approach
would be dangerous'' and would interfere with Congress' power to
oversee the bailout.
   On related topics, Riegle:
   _Said there is ``scant evidence of significant'' progress in
selling assets the government has inherited from failed S&amp;Ls.
Instead of concentrating on hard-to-sell problem real estate, the
RTC has focused on easy sales, he said.
   _Criticized the administration for resisting congressional
efforts to earmark more money for prosecuting thrift fraud. The
Justice Department sought and received only $50 million of the $75
million authorized by Congress. Riegle said that's not enough to
attack a backlog of more than 1,300 major fraud cases.
   _Rebuked the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision
for failing to provide current information on the financial
condition of the S&amp;L industry. The office's predecessor, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, had provided monthly reports with a
lag of about two months. However, the most recent report from the
thrift office is current only through the end of December.

<HEAD>Damage in Asia Seen from US-Mexico Free Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Closer ties between the United States and
Mexico under a planned free trade treaty would undercut low-wage
countries in Asia which compete with Mexico for sales of their
goods and for foreign investment, analysts say.
   President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
announced Monday they had agreed to start talks on a free trade
agreement like the one between the United States and Canada.
   A free trade agreement would break down barriers between the two
countries and encourage businesses to build new factories for
low-cost Mexican labor. It would promote sales of U.S. machinery in
Mexico and Mexican farm products in the United States.
   By creating new jobs in Mexico, it could discourage migration to
this country.
   Eventually the pact could be linked with the free trade accord
that the United States signed with Canada in 1988 and create the
single North American trade zone that Bush promised in his
presidential campaign.
   Figures recently issued by the Labor Department showed that in
1987, the most recent year for which data was available, the cost
of hiring a worker in Mexico was $1.57 an hour. That compared with
$1.79 in South Korea, $2.12 in Hong Kong, $2.31 in Singapore and
$13.40 in this country.
   A free trade agreement with the United States would make Mexico
even more attractive to investors.
   While Eastern Europe also has low wages, it has different
problems.
   ``The Eastern Europeans aren't ready to do a great deal of
exporting to the United States,'' said Ernest L. Preeg, a former
State Department official, who now works for the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.
   Preeg and Nora Lustig, a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution, said the main short-run effect of free trade talks
should be to encourage investment in Mexico. Business people would
be reassured by the prospect of steady sales in the huge U.S.
market for Mexican products.
   Ms. Lustig, a former consultant to the Mexican government, said
she saw textiles and electronics as two important areas where
Mexico would have much to offer investors, in competition with
Asian countries.
   She noted that Mexico also has an advantage over other
competitors in its proximity and low transport costs to the United
States. She said she expected to see more development of industry
near the U.S.-Mexican border.
   She and Preeg both pointed out that the psychological effect of
a free trade agreement will be visible long before the agreement is
signed.
   Preeg predicted that in addition to U.S. and Canadian investors,
moneyed people of other industrial countries will want to start
manufacturing in a place where costs are low and restrictions few
on sales to the United States.
   In addition, confidence could also bring home some of the
billions of dollars that wealthy Mexicans have invested abroad in
past years.
   Among advantages for the United States, Ms. Lustig pointed to
prospects for sale of machinery to equip the new factories in
Mexico and the possibility of making auto parts for less.
   For Mexico, Ms. Lustig listed prospects of sales in the United
States of food products, some of them now restricted by U.S.
regulations: avocados, potatoes, prunes and chocolates, among
others.
   Not everyone sees the prospects so favorably. Last week, Lane
Kirkland, head of the AFL-CIO, and Shirley Carr, head of the
Canadian Labor Congress, predicted more unemployment and the
creation of few high-wage jobs in the United States and Canada from
a U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement.
   In a speech prepared for the Business Roundtable on Monday
night, Salinas replied:
   ``To assume that the creation of new jobs in Mexico will be
attained at the expense of the American worker is to ignore
Mexico's enormous potential as a market for U.S. exports and the
complementarity of our economies,'' he said.
   Mexico's senate, dominated by Salinas' Party of Revolutionary
Institutions, recommended a free trade treaty on May 22. But Senate
President Maximiliano Silerio Esparza warned that some Mexicans _
especially trade unions and business owners fearful of U.S.
competition _ oppose closer ties as increasing Mexican dependence
on the United States.

<HEAD>Little Progress Reported in Amorphous Metals Dispute with Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three rounds of bargaining have produced
little progress in resolving a contentious trade dispute with Japan
over sales of amorphous metals, U.S. officials report.
   Following a day of discussions Monday, a U.S. trade official
said the Japanese are refusing to comply with U.S. demands to
remove barriers to sale of the product, invented by Allied Signal
Inc. of Morristown, N.J.
   The trade official who briefed reporters on condition of
anonymity, said the talks have gotten only about 10 percent of the
way toward a settlement. He said another round of bargaining would
be held in midsummer.
   The official said the Japanese are contending they need more
time to test the product, for which Allied Signal won the patent in
1973. Amorphous metals, marketed under the name Metglas, are used
in electric transformers to cut energy transmission losses.
   ``They want to spend the next two to three years testing,'' the
official said. ``We are saying if they wanted to they could get
this thing moving a lot faster.''
   The dispute is considered a major test case of the Bush
administration's efforts to break down Japanese trade barriers
because it involves a high-technology product with a potential for
$40 million to $50 million in annual sales in Japan.
   Allied Signal contends it has been unfairly blocked from selling
its invention in Japan for more than a decade because the Japanese
want to foster development of a rival amorphous metals product to
be sold when the Allied Signal patent runs out in 1993.
   Last April, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills postponed
taking any action on the Allied Signal petition for economic
sanctions against Japan, saying she would first seek a negotiated
settlement of the dispute. She set a Sept. 15 deadline for reaching
such a settlement.
   Allied Signal sold 18,000 electric transformers using amorphous
metals in the United States last year and projects U.S. sales will
reach 50,000 new units this year.

<HEAD>Hubble Telescope Vibrates at Sunrise, Sunset Making Work Difficult</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seven weeks in space, the Hubble
Telescope still gets the shakes on each of the nearly 15 sunrises
and sunsets it encounters a day and it gets a sudden memory loss in
a region known as the South Atlantic Anomaly.
   While the problems can't be fixed, engineers are preparing
computer commands to counter the effects, Jean Olivier, one of
NASA's top telescope engineers said Monday.
   The two 40-feet-long solar arrays, which convert sunlight into
electricity, set up vibration in the telescope each time it passes
from day to night and from night to day. The problem has persisted
since the Hubble was put into orbit on April 25.
   ``This solar array dynamics is beginning to rear its head as a
limiting factor in our ability to effectively carry this work
out,'' Olivier said. ``We probably would have been along further
than we are today.''
   ``Until we get this corrected _ we are in the process of working
the changes to the software _ we are kind of hampered in our
efficiency.''
   The telescope circles the Earth at an altitude of 281 miles
every 97 minutes _ 14.8 times a day _ encountering a sunrise and
sunset each time. The vibration lasts up to six minutes each time
the instrument passes from day to night and 20 minutes going from
night to day.
   Analyses both in Europe and in this country have determined that
heat causes a bowing in poles _ called bistems _ that pulled the
ribbon-like solar panels from cassettes where they were rolled up
much like a pull-down window shade.
   The solution, Olivier said, is to program computers to put in a
counter-force to dampen the vibration. That will be done in the
coming weeks, he said.
   The other problem involves the electronics of the telescope's
fine guidance sensors. Whenever the spacecraft flies over the South
Atlantic Anomaly, radiation affects the electronic ``bits'' that
make up computer memory instructions and commands.
   The anomaly is a region off the coast of Brazil where radiation
that surrounds the Earth in the so-called Van Allen Belt dips down
to near the telescope's orbit. The closer the telescope is to that
area, Olivier said, the more its electronics are affected.
   ``If it goes through the center, it's in there 10 minutes,'' he
said. ``It's at the very center that the radiation is worst.''
   The solution for that problem, which will be with the telescope
during its 15-year lifetime, is a software program that will
automatically ``refresh'' the electronics' memory 10 times a second.
   Ed Weiler, project scientist for the telescope, said that the
problems have put the start-up work on the project at least three
weeks behind schedule. But, he said, the science instruments' check
is ahead of schedule and all are working fine.

   The ruling Monday by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means
the department must pay Ohio $125,000.
   The court upheld a lower court ruling that Congress waived the
department's traditional immunity from civil claims under two key
environmental laws.
   Ohio had sued the Energy Department in 1986, trying to impose
fines for improper hazardous waste disposal and release of
radioactive materials at the plant, which operated from 1952 until
last summer, when it was shut for cleanup.
   In a 1988 settlement, the Energy Department agreed to pay
$750,000 to Ohio and an additional $250,000 _ half to Ohio and half
to the U.S. Treasury _ if it lost the appeal.
   ``The amount isn't as important as the sting of defeat,'' said
Jack Van Kley, an assistant Ohio attorney general. ``It's more
important that the federal government violated the law and was
penalized.''
   Lawyers for the Energy Department did not immediately return
calls for comment.
   Because of the 1988 agreement, a federal court in Cincinnati
never ruled on the substance of case: whether the Energy Department
and its contractors should be fined for improperly handling
hazardous waste or polluting air or water.
   The issue the Energy Department was appealing was the federal
court's ruling that the government, under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act and the Clean Air Act, waived its immunity from
lawsuits.
   The plant 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati processes uranium for
nuclear weapons.
   Neighbors of the plant won a $78 million settlement last summer,
claiming its contamination lowered property values and caused
emotional distress.
   Hazardous wastes stored at Fernald date back to the Manhattan
Project, which developed the atomic bomb during World War II. A
citizen watchdog group has said barrels of hazardous and chemical
wastes are rusting and leaking.
   The Environmental Protection Agency is supervising the cleanup,
which is expected to take as long as 50 years.

<HEAD>D.C. Mayor Said Concerned About Timing of Retirement Announcement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry, embattled by drug charges,
still plans to abandon a re-election bid, but aides say he wants to
make the announcement without appearing to be pressured into doing
so.
   Barry aides said the mayor had planned to make that announcement
Monday in a television interview but didn't do so because of
publicity surrounding his discussions with civil rights leader
Jesse Jackson and the efforts of others to get Barry to abandon his
re-election plans.
   ``There have been some intrusive parties, Jesse and others,''
said one source close to Barry who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``The man wants to act on his own, without seeming to be pushed
around.''
   Barry has decided he must forgo plans for seeking a fourth,
four-year term in this November's election if he hopes to restart
stalled plea-bargain talks in his drug possession and perjury
trial, several sources have said.
   The mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and
three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug
use.
   Meanwhile, selection of a jury to hear Barry's case in U.S.
District Court is continuing, with the aim of seating a panel by
week's end. Ten people were added to the pool on Monday, bringing
the number of potential jurors to 58.
   Plea discussions, which started more than two weeks ago, broke
down last week with U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens insisting that
Barry plead guilty to a felony charge and the mayor willing to
consider only a misdemeanor plea, sources familiar with the
situation have said.
   The talks have not revolved around Barry's re-election plans,
the sources said.
   Barry, interviewed on WHUR-FM radio Monday night, denied any
kind of linkage.
   ``Those have been false reports,'' he said. ``My defense team
has not asked for or sought any plea bargain. ... Moreover, there's
been an effort to link that to any political decision that I may
make.
   ``There is no linkage, there is no connection between the two.
Any decision I make about my political future will be made
independent of the legal case,'' the mayor said.
   But several aides who met with Barry on Sunday insisted that he
has decided not to run.
   ``When he announces it, it may be one of those things where he
tells no one except a couple of close advisers,'' one aide said.
``He wants to avoid that circus atmosphere.''

<HEAD>Murphy's `48 HRS' Unseats `Total Recall' at the Box Office</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Another 48 HRS.,'' Eddie Murphy's
crime-stopper sequel, pushed the Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi
thriller ``Total Recall'' out of the No. 1 spot at the box office
in its debut weekend.
   ``Another 48 HRS.,'' which critics said offered no improvement
on the 1982 original, sold $19.5 million in tickets, or $4 million
less than ``Total Recall'' did the previous weekend, according to
figures Monday from Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``Total Recall'' plummeted 41 percent, making $15.1 million for
second place. In third was ``Back to the Future Part III'' with
receipts of $7.7 million.
   ``Bird on a Wire,'' the Mel Gibson-Goldie Hawn road movie that
was lightly considered at the summer season's start, continued to
do vigorous business. In fourth place, it grossed $4.8 million and
now has made $49.7 million.
   Not in the top 10 but playing strongly with $286,992 in 85
theaters was ``Longtime Companion,'' the acclaimed movie about a
group of men dying of AIDS. ``Longtime Companion'' has now passed
the $2 million mark in five weeks, and its distributor is trying to
market the film to a wider audience.
   ``Dick Tracy,'' one of the summer's most anticipated titles,
opens Friday, and the Walt Disney Co. already is being slammed for
its plans to count special ``Dick Tracy'' T-shirts as part of the
film's opening gross.
   Disney said the shirts, which give early patrons a guaranteed
seat for the film, should be counted as regular admissions,
although some theaters are selling the shirts for up to $20.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Another 48 HRS.,'' Paramount, $19.5 million, 2,301 screens,
$8,461 per screen, $19.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Total Recall,'' Tri-Star, $15.1 million, 2,076 screens,
$7,255 per screen, $51.1 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Back to the Future III,'' Universal, $7.7 million, 2,054
screens, $3,725 per screen, $49.5 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Bird on a Wire,'' Universal, $4.8 million, 2,008 screens,
$2,400 per screen, $49.7 million, four weeks.
   5. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $4.5 million, 1,777 screens, $2,521
per screen, $133.3 million, 12 weeks.
   6. ``Cadillac Man,'' Orion, $1.8 million, 1,795 screens, $993
per screen, $22.4 million, four weeks.
   7. ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' New Line, $1.6 million,
1,588 screens, $1,002 per screen, $123.2 million, 11 weeks.
   8. ``Fire Birds,'' Disney, $1.2 million, 1,539 screens, $810 per
screen, $12.4 million, three weeks.
   9. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $802,750, 822
screens, $976 per screen, $113.5 million, 15 weeks.
   10. ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' Warner Bros., $642,840, 964 screens,
$666 per screen, $102.7 million, 26 weeks.

<TEXT>
   Election officials
declared Monday night that President Joaquin Balaguer won
re-election in last month's disputed balloting. The review of tally
sheets from each polling district took 27 days.
   The Central Electoral Council said the 83-year-old president won
a sixth term by defeating longtime rival Juan Bosch, an 80-year-old
Marxist former president, by a margin of 678,268 to 653,423 votes.
   Bosch had claimed massive electoral fraud in the May 16 vote.
   The nearly blind Balaguer, leader of the Social Christian
Reformist party, is to begin his new term on Aug. 16. He and his
political allies won 35.7 percent of the vote, the council said.
   It said Bosch, of the Dominican Liberation Party, received 34.4
percent.
   The council said the mayor of Santo Domingo, Jose Francisco Pena
Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party that governed between
1978 and 1986, won 449,323 votes, or 23.6 percent.
   Former president Jacobo Majluta of the Independent Revolutionary
Party won 135,645 votes, or 7.1 percent, the council said.
   Balaguer had won the 1986 election over Majluta, then the
Dominican Revolutionary Party candidate, by just 40,000 votes.
   Voter turnout in last month's election was just 59.2 percent,
the lowest since free elections were first held after the 1961 fall
of the military dictatorship of Gen. Rafael Leonidas Trujillo.
   The governing party did not comment Monday night on the
electoral council's announcement of Balaguer's victory. Nor did
Bosch have any immediate comment.

<HEAD>Internal Strife Slows Rapid Growth of Southern Baptist Convention</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Election of president not set until late afternoon. Lead

<TEXT>
   The Southern Baptist Convention's phenomenal
growth in the late 1960s and '70s dramatized the resurgence of
religious conservatives.
   Now, weakened by internal strife between moderates and
fundamentalists, the denomination that pledged in 1976 to ``reach
every person in the world with the gospel of Jesus Christ by the
year 2000'' is struggling to hold its own.
   The 14.9-million-member church grew by barely half a percent
last year and experienced its first decline in foreign missionaries
in nearly 20 years.
   And even after 11 straight presidential victories by the
fundamentalist wing, the theological and political war rages over
how to interpret the Bible and share authority within the nation's
largest Protestant denomination.
   ``Welcome to the battle of New Orleans, 1990 version'' is how
convention spokesman Alvin C. Shackleford greeted reporters at the
denomination's annual meeting.
   More than 30,000 delegates, or ``messengers,'' are expected for
the three-day meeting opening today. The presidential election was
set for today.
   The church more than doubled membership since the mid-'60s to
surge past the declining United Methodist Church as the nation's
second-largest denomination behind the 55 million-member Roman
Catholic Church.
   But the church's gain of 95,000 members last year was a rise of
only .64 percent, the second-smallest increase since 1936.
   Giving to denominational programs increased 1.89 percent to
$137.3 million, less than half the average 4.63 percent increase of
the last five years and far lower than the 10.39 percent increases
throughout the 1970s.
   And for the first time since 1972, the number of foreign
missionaries declined, dropping 87 to 3,867.
   The controversy that is blamed for the church's decline dates to
1979, when a group of fundamentalists concerned about ``liberal''
tendencies in the church began the first in a series of campaigns
for control of the denomination.
   The church's moderate wing since has expressed increasing
concerns it is being shut out. In some cases the moderates have
held back financial support.
   The conservatives contend the Bible is free from error even in
its historical and scientific claims.
   The moderates charge the fundamentalists are chipping away at
the concept that church members have the ability to interpret the
Bible for themselves.
   On specific issues, fundamentalists are more likely to support
school prayer and oppose legalized abortion and ordination of women.
   Some moderates said it is critical they stop their losing streak
this year.
   ``To say that this convention is an important convention is an
understatement. This is a crucial convention,'' said the Rev.
Daniel Vestal of suburban Atlanta, who lost the presidency last
year to the Rev. C. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla.
   Vestal's opponent this year, the Rev. Morris Chapman of Wichita
Falls, Texas, asked a group of Hispanic ministers Sunday to help
Southern Baptists ``complete the course correction'' that he said
would make the denomination the first to ever reverse a trend away
from believing the Bible can't be wrong.

   One person was killed and at least eight
injured by a powerful car bomb exploded by Shining Path guerrillas
near an election office in this Andean tourist center, police said.
   It was the first rebel attack of note in Peru since Alberto
Fujimori beat Mario Vargas Llosa by a landslide in a runoff
presidential election Sunday.
   A police spokesman said the attack also devastated a number of
buildings adjacent the election office.
   The explosion killed bank guard Erasmo Pena Chipa, 29, and
injured eight bystanders, the spokesman said.
   ``The blast was felt all over the city,'' said the spokesman,
who asked that his name not be used.
   It was the most damaging attack by the Maoist-inspired rebels in
this city 350 miles southeast of Lima since the 1986 bombing of a
tourist train in Cuzco station. Seven foreigners died in the blast.
   On June 2, rebels took over a local radio station and broadcast
an appeal to boycott Sunday's elections.
   More than 18,500 people have died in political violence in the
decade since the Shining Path began its armed insurgency.

<TEXT>
   Veterans said the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the
flag-burning law shows that the way to protect Old Glory is by
constitutional amendment. Civil libertarians said such a move would
itself be a desecration.
   The 1989 law ``was a thinly veiled attempt by Congress to avoid
the issues of a constitutional amendment which will protect our
nation's flag,'' American Legion commander Miles Epling said at
national headquarters in Indianapolis.
   The high court Monday ruled 5-4 that Congress violated
free-speech rights when it outlawed flag burning.
   William Ramsey of the Nebraska Freedoms Foundation Board said he
supports ``whatever it takes'' to protect the flag.
   ``It's sad we have to do anything,'' he said. ``It should be a
matter of common decency that we respect such a symbol of freedom.
It's a sad day.''
   R. Jack Powell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of
America, said of the ruling, ``This seems to clearly indicate that
those who felt a constitutional amendment was necessary all along
are right.''
   But Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe said, ``It would
desecrate the Constitution to carve out an exception to the First
Amendment, and I hope the House and Senate resist that temptation.''
   ``I think it's a proper decision. I hope it doesn't lead to a
panic to adopt a constitutional amendment to override it,'' said
civil rights lawyer William Kunstler. ``That would be a tragedy for
all Americans.''
   One decorated Vietnam War veteran on Capitol Hill, Sen. Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb., called amendment efforts a mistake. He urge
restraint.
   ``I think the current need is fueled by things that we need to
control a bit, and the emotional response that we feel when we see
people damaging the flag should not lead us to amend our
constitution,'' said the Medal of Honor recipient.

   A newly renovated museum with more than 400

in operation at Ford's Theater where the Civil War president was
fatally shot the night of April 14, 1865.
   Included in the new permanent exhibition dedicated Monday is the
single-shot derringer pistol that actor John Wilkes Booth used to
wound Lincoln mortally while he was attending a play at Ford's
Theater.
   Also on display is life-size model of Lincoln in the clothes he
was wearing that night, including the large, black broadcloth frock
coat made for the president by Brooks Brothers to wear at his
second inaugural.
   The museum was closed two years ago for renovation.
   ``After 20 years of accommodating more than a half-million
visitors annually, the museum was ready for a change,'' said Park
Service official Robert G. Stanton.
   The 400 items are more than double the number on display when
the museum first opened in 1968.

   The White House says it has stepped up
security for U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald P. Gregg in
response to death threats from student radicals.
   South Korean police clashed with students in Kwangju as Gregg
reopened a U.S. cultural center that has been repeatedly attacked.
   Some 500 students hurled rocks and firebombs at police who
blocked them from marching off the campus of Chosun University.
They had claimed they had formed ``death squads'' to kidnap Gregg
during his visit to Kwangju.
   The city 155 miles south of Seoul is a hotbed of anti-U.S.
sentiment. The radicals accuse the United States of condoning the
lethal suppression of anti-government demonstrations in 1980, when
South Korea was still under military rule.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday: ``We
take all such threats seriously and be assured that we are taking
the proper security measures and that they are in place.''
   Fitzwater noted that radicals broke into Gregg's residence last
October. The ambassador and his wife escaped unharmed. He said the
United States took ``a number of security measures to augment the
situation'' after that incident.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
Tuesday, while the dollar closed higher against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar finished at 154.40 yen, up 0.30 yen from Monday's
154.10-yen finish. It opened at 154.38 yen and ranged between
153.80 yen and 154.55 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 217.87 points, or 0.67
percent, ending at 32,322.31. The index lost almost 260 points
before recovering by the end of the morning session, and fell back
in the afternoon.
   Traders attributed the index's afternoon plunge to an unexpected
recovery in the morning session despite Monday's 453.11-point
decline.
   Yoshio Ogawa, chief dealer of Nikko Securities Co., said the
index's early decline came following arbitrage selling in an
attempt to take profits between the spot and futures markets.
   The yen's early weakness against the dollar also prompted
selling, he said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar reversed its early downswing
and edged higher in the afternoon as market players sold the yen to
buy the British pound, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical
Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar fell earlier as market players made position
adjustments, she said.
   Other participants remained on the sidelines ahead of a series
of releases of the U.S. economic indicators this week, dealers said.
   Among the announcements are U.S. retail sales, producer prices,
consumer prices and the monthly trade figures for April.

   Mayor David N. Dinkins appealed for a healing of
racial divisions after a judge handed down maximum prison terms to
two young white men for their roles in the mob attack that left a
black teen-ager dead.
   Justice Thaddeus Owens imposed the sentences Monday for what a
prosecutor called ``Neanderthal-type'' behavior by whites who
jumped and shot 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins after he ventured into
mostly white Bensonhurst on Aug. 23.
   Joseph Fama, 19, named by prosecutors as the triggerman, was
sentenced to 32 and two-thirds years to life in prison for murder
and other crimes.
   Keith Mondello, 19, identified as the ringleader, drew five and
one-third to 16 years in prison, plus a $2,000 fine. He had been
acquitted of murder and manslaughter but convicted of riot and
other offenses.
   Fama and Mondello each must serve the lower range of their
sentences before they become eligible for parole.
   The slaying heightened racial tensions during the campaign that
resulted in Dinkins' election as New York's first black mayor. The
verdict in Mondello's case in May set off rock- and bottle-throwing
melees by blacks in Brooklyn.
   In a statement from City Hall, Dinkins said ``the stiff
sentences imposed today speak for themselves.''
   Now that the criminal justice system has spoken, we all must
join our hearts, heads and hands together to rid our city of the
racism that destroys lives and communities,'' he said. ``We have
had enough of tragedy. Together, we must and we will move the
healing process forward.''
   When Fama's sentence was read in the packed courtroom, the
victim's father, Moses Stewart, murmured ``Yes!'' Later, Stewart
called the ruling ``a small joy for myself but a great victory for
black people all over the state.''
   Members of Fama's family screamed in Italian and wept. ``Not my
son! Not my son!'' shouted his mother, Josephine Fama.
   Hawkins and three friends had gone to the Brooklyn neighborhood
to look at a used car. A mob of whites, having been warned by
Mondello's ex-girlfriend about ``outsiders,'' set upon the black
teen-agers with baseball bats.
   Assistant District Paul Burns, arguing for the maximum term,
called the killing ``a Neanderthal-type of behavior.''
   ``We need to send the message to every community that we will
not tolerate senseless violence,'' the prosecutor said.
   Mondello's attorney, Stephen Murphy, told the judge, ``I believe
that the law should rise above public opinion.''
   On Monday, jury selection began for co-defendant John Vento, and
trial dates were set for five other young men accused in the case.
   Vento, 21, is charged with murder as well as riot, assault and
other crimes. He faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted of
murder.

   Nepal, the world's only Hindu kingdom,
will free all Christian prisoners who were jailed by the former
government for illegal proselytizing, the royal palace said today.
   The palace said in a statement King Birendra has ``granted
amnesty to all religious prisoners'' on the advice of Prime
Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in view of the ``new political
environment ... in the country.''
   Currently, 29 Christians, including 14 children younger than age
18, are serving sentences for proselytizing. There are no religious
prisoners of other faiths. A human rights report recently said 144
other Christians were in police custody across the country facing
trial.
   The royal statement said King Birendra has ``given instructions
for the dismissal of all cases against persons awaiting trial for
religious activities.''
   A Home Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said orders had already been issued to prison authorities to set
free the 29 imprisoned Christians.
   ``We believe this is the Lord's doing,'' said Samuel Sotemba,
the pastor of Nepal Christian Fellowship, a local church that like
hundreds of other protestant churches in Nepal operates
unofficially.
   The amnesty appeared to be the first step towards Nepalese
church leaders' demand that the new pro-democracy government change
a 32-year-old law banning religious conversion.
   Human rights activists in Nepal say the country's Christians
have faced widespread persecution by previous governments that were
dominated by the monarchy.
   A popular movement in April forced King Birendra to loosen his
grip on power and appoint pro-democracy leaders to government
offices.
   Although the current constitution, which will soon be rewritten,
allows freedom of religion, it prescribes a one-year prison term
for freely converting oneself to another religion, three years for
an attempt to convert someone else and six years for successfully
converting others.
   Christian leaders say there are between 35,000 and 40,000
Christians in the country, but government records put the number at
3,000.
   About 75 percent of the Himalayan kingdom's 17 million people
are Hindus, 5 percent Moslems and 3 percent Buddhists.

   A 17-year-old Israeli going to pray at the
Western Wall was stabbed twice in the stomach today at the entrance
to Jerusalem's walled Old City, police and hospital officials said.
   Police arrested a 15-year-old Palestinian suspect immediately
after the attack at Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to the
Old City, a police spokesman said.
   The victim, whose name was not released, was in satisfactory
condition at Sharei Tzadek Hospital, spokeswoman Orna Cohen said.
He is a student at a yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, and is from
Dimona in Israel's Negev Desert.
   The Western Wall is the last remnant of the ancient Jewish
Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. It is the holiest site
for Jews.

   A Delta rocket lifted into orbit
today an Indian communications satellite that was grounded a year
because of damage first from a launch pad accident and then the
California earthquake.
   The unmanned rocket thundered skyward, the moon in the
background, at 1:52 a.m. About an hour later, the satellite
separated from the rocket and settled into a temporary orbit 130
miles high.
   The satellite will reach a circular orbit 22,300 miles high in
10 days, said Sastri Vasantha, project director of India's
Department of Space.
   McDonnell Douglas launch commentator Ray Adams said the rocket
went ``right down the middle of the path.''
   ``That's the way we like to see them fly,'' he said.
   Abid Hussain, India's ambassador to the United States, said
Monday the satellite will ``spread education and knowledge, science
and new culture to hundreds and thousands of those who have been
out of the mainstream of life.''
   India has 800 million people. Its communications ``are mostly
guided by land facilities, and there are hundreds and thousands of
villages that are remote from the metropolitan cities and we have
not been able to reach there,'' Hussain.
   The $80 million Insat satellite will replace one that was
deployed in 1983 by the shuttle Challenger.
   Once it becomes operational in mid-July, the satellite will send
video and voice signals to TV, radio and disaster-warning
receivers, and transmit weather observations to a forecasting
center in New Delhi.
   McDonnell Douglas' rocket and launch services cost nearly $50
million. It was the fourth commercial launch of a Delta.
   The satellite was scheduled to ride a Delta rocket into orbit
last June, which would have made it America's first commercial
launch to reach orbit. But a cable on a crane broke and dropped a
heavy hook on the satellite 10 days before liftoff.
   Ford Aerospace, which built the satellite, returned the
spacecraft to Palo Alto, Calif., and replaced an antenna and made
other repairs at a cost of $10 million.
   The earthquake that struck Northern California in October caused
further damage _ about a dozen cells in the satellite's solar
panels had to be replaced at a cost of about $150,000.
   Ford Aerospace insured the satellite for any problems on the
ground. The Indian government, which also has insurance, assumed
responsibility after liftoff.
   Because of the one-year delay, India has had to lease the
services of other satellite communications companies, Vasantha
said. The Insat satellite that will be replaced is operating at
about 70 percent capacity, he said.
   The new craft is the fourth and final in a series of India's
Insat 1 satellites. It has a working lifetime of seven years. An
updated version, the Insat 2, will be carried into space next year
by Europe's Ariane rocket.

   Journalists stood on street corners hawking
a newspaper they published on their own after launching Norway's
first newspaper strike in 44 years.
   The 32-page tabloid Avisa, the Norwegian word for newspaper,
appeared on Monday, a day after wage negotiations collapsed. It
competed with regular newspapers that succeeded in publishing thin
Monday editions.
   The Norwegian Union of Journalists had ordered strikes at eight
major newspapers and the national news service NTB, said union
officer Bente Sabel.
   Norway's publishers association responded by locking out
reporters from 57 other newspapers.
   Most of the 65 newspapers published Monday editions, filled
mainly with advertisements.
   In all, about 2,000 journalists were on strike or locked out.
   Employers offered less than half the journalists' demand of a
4.57 percent increase on their $34,460 average annual salary,
reports said.
   ``In our view, it is mostly a wage problem,'' said Tore
Cappelen, the publishers chief negotiator.
   Cappelen said it was too early to attempt new talks. ``A lot
depends on what happens with NRK,'' he said. Journalists at the
state NRK radio and television network have also threatened to
strike.
   Sabel said the closest they came to new talks was ``when I sold
a copy of Avisa to a publishers negotiator.''
   The union, founded in 1946, has claimed it is ready to make its
first strike a long one, and to publish Avisa and similar
newspapers daily.
   Monday's Avisa edition was delayed, and limited to 10,000
copies, due to problems in buying newsprint, Sabel said.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged after
nervous fluctuations today, while the dollar continued its upward
trend against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average fell 217.87 points, or 0.67
percent, closing at 32,322.31. The index declined almost 260
points, more than regained that loss by the end of the morning
session and then fell back in the afternoon.
   Traders attributed the fluctuations to investors' caution after
Monday's 453.11-point plunge and to the yen's weakness against the
dollar.
   In early trading, market players used arbitrage selling in an
attempt to take profits from price differences between the spot and
the futures markets, but after a round of selling began picking up
underpriced issues, said Yoshio Ogawa, a chief trader with Nikko
Securities Co.
   Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co., said
caution and discouragement over the yen sent prices back down in
the afternoon.
   ``The morning recovery was too quick considering the situation _
yesterday's decline and the yen's weakness,'' he said.
   First section volume was estimated at 500 million shares, up
from Monday's 350 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 154.40 yen, up 0.30
yen from Monday's 154.10-yen finish. It opened at 154.38 yen and
ranged between 153.80 yen and 154.55 yen.
   Since closing at 149.45 yen on May 28, the dollar has gained
against the yen on 10 of the last 11 trading days.
   The dollar reversed an early downswing today and edged higher in
the afternoon as market players sold the yen to buy the British
pound, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``The yen plunged against the pound and the dollar because of
the Financial Times story today,'' she said.
   The Financial Times reported from London today that Britain is
prepared to join the European Monetary System as early as September
if the British pound is strong enough in the foreign exchange
market then.
   The dollar fell earlier as market players made position
adjustments, Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Many participants remained on the sidelines awaiting a series of
U.S. economic indicators due to be announced this week, other
dealers said.
   These include U.S. retail sales, producer prices, consumer
prices and the monthly trade figures for April.
   About $13.98 billion changed hands in spot trading.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 87.45 points as of 5 p.m. from
Monday's close of 87.18. The yield stood at 7.085 percent, down
from 7.140 percent.

<HEAD>Pioneering Horror Movie Producer Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir James Carreras, who as head of Hammer Films
produced horror movies that scared the daylights out of a whole
generation of filmgoers, has died, according to a family death
notice published today. He was 81.
   Carreras died peacefully on Saturday of a stroke at his home at
Henley-on-Thames, west of London, the notice said.
   Known as a mild-mannered family man, Carreras always said the
ghastly monsters with which Hammer Films filled screens around the
world were harmless, escapist entertainment.
   Carreras built up the Hammer company after World War II, and in
the mid-1950s began making the gruesome, low-budget horror films
for which the British studio became internationally famous.
   His first big hit and the first Hammer film to be distributed in
the United States was ``The Quatermass Experiment,'' based on a
1954 television science fiction series.
   The horror aspects of that film inspired Carreras to look for
material among the monsters popular with film fans in the 1930s. He
raised from the dead Frankenstein, Dracula and other creepy
characters of legend and novel who had faded from the screen.
   ``The Curse of Frankenstein'' in 1956 struck an immediate chord
with the public who liked its fantastic sets, garish color and
melodramatic plot. Hammer horror films boosted the careers of two
actors who became synonymous with escapist horror fare _ Peter
Cushing and Christopher Lee.
   ``Dracula,'' with Lee in the title role and Cushing as Van
Helsing, followed Frankenstein and several sequels were made to
each. Lee played Dracula in nearly a dozen films.
   The sound stage at Hammer was filled at one time or another with
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Jack the Ripper, and Sherlock Holmes in
``The Hound of the Baskervilles.''
   Carreras shunned the creative side of filmmaking, preferring the
role of impresario. Born June 9, 1909, he inherited his flair for
showmanship from his father, Enrique Carreras, the owner of a chain
of London movie theaters.
   Carreras made sure films were shot quickly and cheaply, and
played a role in the British film industry similar to that played
by Roger Corman in Hollywood.
   Like Corman, Carreras made films that were the objects of
critical scorn, but developed a strong cult following. The company
did not hold press screenings, but devoted resources and
imagination to promotion.
   In one typical Carreras-inspired stunt, coffins were carried
through the streets to promote the opening of a horror film.
   The Hammer company also produced pirate adventures, war epics,
bloody thrillers and a peculiar prehistoric yarn, ``One Million
Years BC,'' which helped make a star of a little known American
actress named Raquel Welch.
   Even in the 1970s, films under Carreras rarely cost more than a
modest 200,000 pounds ($336,000 at current exchange rates). At the
studio's height, it produced eight films a year.

<HEAD>University President, Under Fusion Fire, Announces Retirement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   University of Utah President Chase N.
Peterson, a cheerleader for the phantom phenomenon of tabletop
fusion, is retiring under fire for a hidden, $500,000 transfer of
money toward its development.
   Peterson, 60, said Monday he would retire next year but had no
intention of resigning under pressure.
   In a resolution last week, the faculty's Academic Senate had
questioned Peterson's ability to run the 23,500-student university
in light of the furor over the money transfer. Peterson has held
the post since 1983.
   The president acknowledged that the ``period of time I can
effectively provide leadership is nearing an end.''
   Peterson had come under sharp criticism twice before in the past
15 months, first for the school's announcement of a breakthrough in
the quest for fusion and then for his handling of a $15 million
donation that later was returned.
   Last month, controversy erupted when it became known that a
$500,000 donation to the school's fusion research center that had
been characterized by the university as an ``anonymous,'' outside
gift actually was the result of a Peterson-authorized transfer of
money from the school's Research Foundation.
   Peterson on June 1 said that hiding the origin of the donation
was a mistake. He said he had hoped to avoid jealousy within other
departments, but had ``hurt the credibility of the institute.''
   Chemist B. Stanley Pons of the university and British colleague
Martin Fleischmann announced in March 1989 that they had achieved a
sustained nuclear fusion reaction in a tabletop experiment. The
announcement held out the prospect of a cheap, safe and virtually
inexhaustible source of energy.
   Despite extreme scientific skepticism that continues today, the
Legislature appropriated $5 million last fall to establish the
National Cold Fusion Institute at the school and to protect the
state's patent rights.
   The center has tried to raise money from the government and
corporations but has had limited success. A Department of Energy
panel recommended against funding, and the only confirmed
contribution was $50,000 from Utah Power &amp; Light Co. in March.
   In June, Salt Lake medical equipment manufacturer James L.
Sorenson donated $15 million in pharmaceutical stock to the
university with the understanding the medical school and hospital
would be renamed in his honor.
   Peterson was forced to return the money after protests from
doctors, faculty and students.
   Pons said he was grateful for Peterson's support.
   ``He made a strong effort to see it through. We regret that it
is an issue in his retirement decision,'' Pons said. ``We still
know that we are right, and we are sure that soon he will be able
to list cold fusion as one of the positive accomplishments by the
University of Utah.''
   Critics lauded Peterson's decision to retire at the end of the
1990-91 academic year.
   ``I think that his timetable is entirely appropriate and his
statement is appreciated by the faculty,'' said Sandra Taylor, a
history professor who had introduced the Academic Senate resolution.
   Peterson was the school's vice president for health sciences
when surgeons completed the first artificial heart implant in 1982
on Barney Clark, who died after 112 days on the device.
   Peterson became the university's 11th president in 1983,
succeeding David P. Gardner.
   His supporters most often cite his talent for fund-raising.
   ``We don't raise money. We generate support for important
programs,'' Peterson said in an interview Monday night. That
support totaled $42 million this year, while ``before I came the
highest was $17 million.''
   Donations for the last five years amounted to $207 million, he
said.
   But Peterson said the period in which he could effectively lead
was nearing an end.
   ``Leadership needs to be rather forceful, occasionally bold and
likely occasionally wrong _ or judged to be wrong _ and
occasionally bruising, which probably means you shouldn't be here
forever,'' he said.

   Carbon-monoxide seeped into a condominium
and killed two roomates of a woman who committed suicide by
shutting herself in the garage with her car's engine running,

   The bodies of Ruth M. Goran and her roommates were discovered

Sgt. Jim Flonacher said Monday.
   The deaths of the roommates, Claude R. Hillhouse, 42, and Gordon

   ``I'm sure she didn't mean to take two with her,'' said
Hillhouse's nephew, Scott Hillhouse.
   ``She wasn't suicidal,'' said Ms. Goran's daughter, Karen

   She said Hillhouse was her mother's boyfried.

   Co Star, a Soviet company that produces and distributes films,

advertising to U.S. companies doing business in the Soviet Union.
Those companies include General Motors and AT&amp;T.
   In return, the show's U.S. producers will get technical support

   A catastrophic spill from the burning supertanker
Mega Borg couldn't come at a worse time of year for shellfish and
birds on the Texas coast, environmentalists say.
   The Coast Guard estimated the Norwegian ship had spilled up to
100,000 gallons of its 38 million-gallon cargo of light crude. Much
of the oil was being consumed by fires that erupted Saturday 57
miles southeast of Galveston.
   Currents and winds were expected to push escaping oil toward a
200-mile stretch of coast between Freeport and Corpus Christi. But
the Coast Guard said the currents also were expected to keep the
spill from coming ashore.
   Roy Hann, a Texas A&amp;M environmental engineering professor, said
damage to the ecology would be catastrophic if millions of gallons
reached the bays and estuaries along the central coast where fish
hatch and birds nest.
   Gary Clark, president of the Houston Audubon Society, said the
spill ``couldn't have happened at a worse time of year'' for
shellfish and birds.
   ``In mid-June the immediate consequences on breeding birds would
be devastating,'' he said. ``It could wipe out the brown pelican.''
   Clark said light crude would be more devastating to birds over
the short-term because it floats, and ``just a slight ingestion of
light crude could kill numerous birds.'' Heavy crude, which sinks
to the bottom, would have a long-term impact.
   Pat Rogers, who owns a seafood business in Galveston and a fleet
of shrimp boats, said any oil that might make it to the ocean floor
could kill the shrimp.
   ``This is a critical time for the brown shrimp because they're
leaving the estuary areas for the Gulf,'' Rogers said. ``It
couldn't be any more critical than what it is right now.''
   Brown and white shrimp are the two species most often found in
restaurants, and major populations of the species are found in the
area of the burning tanker.
   The response to the disaster was delayed during the weekend as
firefighting and oil containment equipment was brought in from
Louisiana, Alabama and even the Netherlands.
   ``What I guess disturbs me,'' said Clark, ``is I don't
understand why the Texas coast, the Houston area, doesn't have a
well-coordinated response to something like this. It's all
reactionary, it's all ad hoc, it's all here after the fact.''
   ``I think we need to hold our public officials responsible in a
big way,'' he said. ``There should have been equipment in place to
take care of this thing right away.''

<HEAD>Ryan No-Hitter Breaks Own Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nolan Ryan of the Texas Rangers struck
out 14 batters for his sixth no-hitter, more than any pitcher in
major league history.
   The 43-year-old right-hander broke his own record in the 5-0
victory over the Oakland A's Monday night and also became the
oldest ballplayer to pitch a no-hitter _ two years older than Cy
Young.
   Ryan now has two more no-hitters than Sandy Koufax and three
more than Bob Feller. It was career shutout No. 59.
   ``I haven't gotten bored with no-hitters, yet,'' Ryan said. ``I
don't know how many more chances I'm going to get, but the way I've
been throwing, it's certainly not out of the question that I'll get
another shot.''
   Ryan is the first player to pitch a no-hitter for three teams _
the Rangers, California Angels and Houston Astros. His no-hitters
span three decades, from the 1970s to the '90s _ also a first.
   In 24 seasons, Ryan has pitched 12 one-hitters and 19
three-hitters. He is the all-time strikeout leader with 5,152 and
six wins short of 300.
   ``He's amazing,'' Oakland manager Tony La Russa said.
``Obviously, I pull for the A's more than I do for Nolan Ryan, but
you just have to respect him. ... There is honor in defeat
sometimes.''

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed today against most major
foreign currencies in calm European trading. Gold prices were
higher.
   Traders said the dollar is drifting in a narrow range as markets
wait for U.S. economic figures scheduled for release at the end of
the week.
   U.S. May producer prices, due for release Thursday, are expected
to be up 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent from a drop of 0.3 percent in
April. On Friday, the May consumer price index is expected to be up
0.3 percent from an increase of 0.2 percent in April.
   The same day, the U.S. April trade balance is expected to
register a deficit between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, down from
$8.45 billion in March.
   A Milan trader said the U.S. currency is fundamentally sturdy.
   ``The dollar is strong but it's going to need more substantial
support to take it any further,'' the trader said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 154.40 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.60 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6923 West German marks, up from 1.6910
   _1.4375 Swiss francs, down from 1.4400
   _5.6963 French francs, up from 5.6900
   _1.9000 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9040
   _1,243.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.75
   _1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1705
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6997, compared with $1.6858 late Monday.
   Gold dealers said they expect bullion to move higher.
   ``It may take a few days, but I think that after the market gets
a bit longer we'll see a pretty good drop,'' said a dealer with a
London bullion house. ``The fundamentals haven't really changed.''
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $355.40 a troy ounce, up
from $354.45 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $356.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $355.60, up from $355.00 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.07 to close at a bid $357.82.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.02 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $5.01.

<HEAD>India To Re-open Border Crossings with Nepal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India's agreement to re-open border
crossings should end the economic hardships suffered by landlocked
Nepal since New Delhi imposed the restrictions 15 months ago,
Indian newspapers said today.
   Prime Ministers V.P. Singh of India and Krishna Prasad Bhattarai
of Nepal announced an agreement Sunday on restoring trade and
transit links, and India agreed to re-open the border crossings by
July 1.
   ``Today we have finally put an unfortunate interlude behind us
and have fully normalized our relations,'' Singh told a news
conference in announcing the agreement.
   The agreement provides for concessions on customs duties for
goods traded between the two countries and the dropping of
restrictions on Indian citizens seeking employment in Nepal. The
two countries also agreed to consider their mutual security
concerns.
   Major Indian newspapers praised the agreement in editorials
today.
   The agreement will ``put an end to the hardships suffered by the
people of Nepal as a result of a major interruption in the flow of
essential consumer goods,'' said the independent Indian Express
newspaper.
   Relations between the two neighbors soured in March 1989 when
Rajiv Gandhi, then India's prime minister, closed 13 of the 15
goods transit points on its border with Nepal when trade and
transit treaties expired.
   Gandhi imposed the restrictions after Nepal refused to agree to
Indian demands for a single treaty covering both trade and transit.
India refused to renew the existing treaties.
   India saw Nepal's refusal to negotiate a single treaty as
reflecting a desire to forge economic ties with other countries at
India's expense.
   India also was apparently concerned about Nepal's increasingly
close ties with its northern neighbor, China. In 1988, India
opposed a decision by Nepal to purchase a large quantity of
anti-aircraft weapons from China.
   The border closings severely restricted the flow of imports to
Nepal, which have to be transported overland from Indian ports to
the Himalayan kingdom. Nepal's exports are not significant.
   During the past 15 months, new governments took over in both
countries and moved to resolve the disputes.
   Singh's National Front coalition replaced Gandhi's government in
December. Bhattarai was sworn in as head of an interim coalition
government in April after an eight-week pro-democracy campaign
forced King Birendra to end a partyless system of government.
   The new agreement basically restores the situation as it existed
before March 1989 when the treaties expired. The two countries have
agreed to begin negotiations on new trade and transit treaties, but
did not set any date.
   The ``absurdity of India waging a war of economic attrition
against Nepal with which it is closely bound by ties of history,
geography, culture and economic independence is all too clear,''
The Hindu, a conservative, English-language newspaper said.

   A man has pleaded guilty to stabbing to
death three boys _ including two brothers who had gone cycling in a
park _ and trying to murder a youngster he snatched from a movie
theater.
   A jury will be selected June 25 to decide the penalty for
28-year-old Westley Allan Dodd _ death or life in prison without
parole.
   Dodd had been held without bail since his arrest Nov. 13 on
charges of murdering Lee Joseph Iseli, 4, of Portland, Ore., and
brothers Cole Neer, 11, and William Neer, 10, of Vancouver.
   Dodd, who had earlier pleaded innocent, offered no explanation
for the change of plea.
   The Neer brothers' bodies were found Sept. 4 in a park. Iseli's
body was discovered near Vancouver Lake Nov. 1, three days after he
disappeared from a Portland schoolyard. Rape charges were dropped
for lack of evidence.
   Dodd was arrested after he carried 6-year-old James Kirk II from
a Camas theater. The child was let go, but his mother's boyfriend
tracked down Dodd and brought him back.
   Dodd was charged with kidnapping and attempted murder in that
case. The kidnapping charge was dropped Monday.

<HEAD>British Airways Suspends Engineer In Windscreen Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways said today that it has suspended
an engineer at the airport where maintenance work was done on the
jetliner that lost a windshield at 23,000 feet, sucking out the
pilot.
   Pilot Tim Lancaster was saved by cabin staff who clutched his
ankles as he was buffeted against the nose cone for 15 minutes on
Sunday until the copilot managed to bring the BAC 1-11 down for an
emergency landing.
   The 41-year-old pilot was recovering at Southampton General
Hospital from broken bones, bruises and frostbite.
   British Airways said the engineer, based at a maintenance depot
in the central England city of Birmingham, has been suspended with
full pay. The employee was not identified.
   ``The suspension does not imply anything. It is quite normal in
an investigation like this,'' said an airline spokesman, who asked
not to be identified in accordance with British custom.
   The domestic British news agency, Press Association, quoting
airline sources, said the suspended engineer was directly involved
in the routine replacement of the flight deck windows of the
18-year-old plane two days before the near-disaster.
   British Airways refused to confirm this, but did say that the
windows were replaced Friday in Birmingham.
   Investigators for the government's Air Accident Investigation
have recovered the 2-by-3-foot windshield and have interviewed the
flight crew.
   The plane had taken off from Birmingham in northern England
carrying 81 holiday makers to Malaga, Spain.
   On Monday, Lancaster met for an hour with his rescuers _ purser
Nigel Ogden, steward Simon Rogers and stewardess Susan Prince _ and
posed with the trio, smiling and barechested in his hospital bed.
   ``They were magnificent. If it was not for them I would not be
here now,'' he said of the crew.
   Lancaster, responding to written questions from reporters, said
he remembered hearing a bang when the window blew out of the
18-year-old jet, and then felt himself being pulled from his seat.
   He was wearing a lap belt but had unfastened his shoulder
harness after takeoff.
   ``I remember the buffeting of the wind,'' he said. ``I tried to
shout back at the crew but I'm sure they could not hear me.''
   He said the thought of death ``did cross my mind for a moment or
two.''
   Lancaster, whose replies were relayed by a British Airways
spokesman, said his first thought was that he had to keep breathing
in the thin, cold air.
   He described the ordeal as ``extremely fast _ frantic,'' and
said he felt no pain during the 15 minutes it took the plane to
land.
   The 21-year British Airways veteran, however, said the
experience would not make him stop flying.

<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hoaxer used a public relations firm's
answering machine to trick the news media into running a bogus
story about Elizabeth Taylor, a publicist says.
   The story, distributed worldwide by The Associated Press and
United Press International, said Miss Taylor, 58, was romantically
involved with a 23-year-old man and had undergone surgery over the
weekend.
   ``It is a hoax,'' Miss Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam, said
Monday. ``I have contacted Miss Taylor's attorneys and we are going
to conduct an investigation. It is apparently somebody using my
(telephone) service.''
   Ms. Sam's New York City public relations firm has been the sole
media link during Miss Taylor's nine-week hospitalization for
pneumonia at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica.
   The Sam organization has discouraged the news media from calling
St. John's about Miss Taylor and has instructed the hospital's
public relations staff not to answer reporters' questions. Under
California privacy law, hospitals must abide by the wishes of
patients who don't want information released about them.
   The hoaxer said Miss Taylor underwent an abdominal biopsy and
was expected to be released from the hospital within two weeks on
the arm of Julian Lee Hobbs of Lake Orion, Mich., described as Miss
Taylor's boyfriend.
   Hobbs is apparently an aspiring actor sometimes known as Rory
Emerald. Newspaper editors in Michigan say his representatives have
pitched stories to them in the past but they doubted their veracity.
   The AP office in Los Angeles had placed calls to the hospital
and to Chen Sam and Associates after receiving a message Sunday
from an AP affiliate in England, the Press Association. Editors at
the British domestic news agency had heard Miss Taylor had
undergone another operation and wanted a story.
   Paulette Weir, the hospital spokeswoman, was unavailable for
comment Sunday. When the reporter called New York, he was connected
to Ms. Sam's answering service and left a message.
   A short time later, a woman returned the call, saying she was
Lisa Flowers from Chen Sam and Associates. She then gave the
reporter the bogus information about Miss Taylor's romantic
involvement and the surgery.
   The hoaxer also provided the same story to UPI and City News
Service, a metropolitan Los Angeles wire service.
   The AP reporter, in an effort to verify the authenticity of the
source, later placed a second call to Ms. Sam's answering service,
leaving a message for Lisa Flowers. The answering service operator
accepted that message without question.
   Later, an AP reporter placed a third call to Ms. Sam's answering
service. A woman identifying herself as Ms. Sam returned that call
and verified the identity of ``Ms. Flowers'' and the story she had
told.
   Ms. Sam said Monday that no one from her organization had talked
to reporters on Sunday.
   Ms. Sam said a woman involved in the hoax had telephoned
Billie's Registry, her answering service, and was given the
publicist's messages after somehow providing proper coded
identification to the switchboard.
   ``It was all very cleverly done,'' Ms. Sam said. ``It was done
on a Sunday when we weren't around. I can't understand how they got
the code. I've had to change the entire system here.''
   Billie McDonald, owner of the answering service, said she
couldn't offer any details about her staff's role in the hoax.
   Ms. Sam said Miss Taylor was still recuperating at the hospital
and had not undergone any surgery over the weekend.
   ``I was out there last week,'' Ms. Sam said. ``She's looking
wonderful and doing much better. She should be there two more
weeks.''

<TEXT>
   Students formed a human chain around
Sofia University today and declared a strike over alleged
government manipulation of what were billed as Bulgaria's first
free elections in 58 years.
   The long-ruling Communists, who have renamed themselves the
Socialist Party as they strive to break with a repressive past,
appeared headed for a decisive victory in Sunday's elections.
   Initial official results announced today for 111 seats in the
400-seat Parliament gave the Socialists 68 seats against 32 for the
main opposition alliance, the Union of Democratic Forces.
   Eight seats went to the mainly ethnic Turkish Rights and
Freedoms Movement, and the other three were split among lesser
parties.
   Leaders of the 16-party Union of Democratic Forces claim a
series of election irregularities affected the outcome of Sunday's
first round of balloting.
   They rejected the Socialists' offer to join a governing
coalition, and about 60,000 opposition supporters staged a protest
rally Monday night outside election headquarters.
   ``Down with the Red Mafia'' and ``We Won't Work For the Red,''
they shouted. Today, demonstrations forced the closure of several
downtown roads.
   Today, about 3,000 students staged a strike against what they
said were election manipulations. Some ringed a university
building, blocking entrances.
   The Socialists, heir to the Communists who have controlled this
Balkan nation since 1944, appeared on the verge of becoming the
only Communists to win a free election in an Eastern European
country newly free of the Soviet orbit.
   West German and Bulgarian projections gave them about 48 percent
of the vote. The Union of Democratic Forces was second with about
36 percent.
   In third place was the Agrarian Party, a former docile Communist
ally that declared its independence this year, with about 8 percent
of the vote. It was followed by the Movement for Rights and
Freedoms, with about 5.7 percent.
   The rest of the vote was divided among 34 other parties that
fielded candidates.
   Half the seats in Parliament are to be filled through races for
single-seat constituencies, the other half based upon parties'
proportional showing. The results announced today were for
single-seat constituencies.
   Sofia radio said runoffs would be held Sunday in the at least 73
districts where no single candidate won the necessary majority.
Sixteen constituences apparently were not yet fully counted.
   Premier Andrei Lukanov, a leading Socialist Party member, went
on television Monday night and urged all parties ``to look beyond
party passions'' and take part in a ``broad national coalition.''
   ``There are no losers in the present elections because in the
final reckoning the victory of democracy is a victory for all,'' he
was quoted as saying by the Bulgarian news agency BTA.
   But the Union's chairman, Zhelyu Zhelev, told Monday's rally
that the opposition alliance would not form a coalition the former
Communists; ``In the National Assembly we will be a powerful
opposition faction.''
   The Union picked up immediate backing from the Agrarian Party
and the Alternative Socialist Party, which split from the
mainstream Socialists because it favors more radical reforms.
   The growing support for a united opposition means the Socialists
will probably have to tackle Bulgaria's growing inflation, $10
billion debt, and consumer shortages alone.
   The Union favors a quick move to a Western-style free-market
economy, while the Socialists favored slower reforms.
   Union spokesman Georgi Spasov alleged that irregularities in the
voting included political agitation in front of polling stations.
   Petar Beron, a Union official, claimed that the irregularities
made as much as a 6 percent difference in the vote. He said the
opposition coalition would seek another vote in some places.
   Western observers reported election irregularities but said they
did not affect the overall results substantially.
   With nearly a century as a strong political force in Bulgaria,
the Communist Party was the known quantity. The municipal and local
party structures of the former Communist Party are largely intact
in small towns and villages and have been taken over by the
Socialists.
   According to the projections, the Union topped the Socialists
only in Sofia, with the Socialists carrying the countryside and
provincial cities.
   The opposition had wanted the elections postponed until fall to
allow more time for non-Communist parties to organize.
   Bulgaria had only a nascent opposition when reform Communists
ousted longtime Communist strongman Todor Zhivkov last November.

   Korean Air has signed a $4.8 billion contract
for 23 Boeing 747-400s to be delivered by the end of the decade.
   The contract signed Monday includes spare parts and training and
commits Korean Air to 31 of Boeing's most sophisticated and biggest
jetliner, more than any other carrier except Japan Air Lines. JAL
has signed up for 40 of the world's largest passenger jets.
   Frank Shrontz, Boeing chairman and chief executive officer, said
at a news conference that the large order reflects the fact that
traffic growth in the Pacific has been higher than in either the
United States or Europe. The 747-400s, each of which will be
equipped to carry 392 passengers, also are best suited to meet the
long-range flights and high-capacity needs of the region, Shrontz
said.
   Boeing officials said 307 of the Seattle, Wash., company's
747-400s have been ordered, with 71 so far delivered to airlines
around the world.
   The Korean order was the third largest ever received by Boeing
and the third multibillion-dollar purchase of Boeing aircraft in as
many weeks. The others also were from Asian air carriers: a $2
billion order from the Chinese government and a $3.1 billion order
from Japan Air Lines.

   Former national security adviser John M.
Poindexter received a six-month sentence and a stern lecture from a
judge who said he undermined democracy by lying to Congress about
the Iran-Contra affair.
   Poindexter became the first of seven people convicted in the
scandal to receive a prison term when he was sentenced Monday by
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene.
   The judge said Poindexter, who plans to appeal, deserved
incarceration as the ``decision-making head of the Iran-Contra
operation.''
   Probation ``would be tantamount to a statement that a scheme to
lie (to) and obstruct Congress is of no great moment,'' Greene said.
   Poindexter, who served as President Reagan's national security
adviser from late 1985 until the Iran-Contra scandal forced his
resignation in November 1986, was convicted of conspiracy, making
false statements to Congress and obstructing lawmakers' inquiries
into the Iran-Contra affair.
   Greene said Poindexter, former White House aide Oliver L. North
and others usurped political power from Congress when they set up a
covert operation to arm the Contra rebels in Nicaragua in defiance
of a congressional ban on such aid.
   ``When Admiral Poindexter and his associates obstructed the
Congress, what were they seeking to accomplish?'' the judge asked.
``In a word it was to nullify the decision that body had made on
the issue of supplies to the Contras.''
   Poindexter was found guilty of conspiring to thwart attempts by
Congress in 1986 to verify reports that North was coordinating the
secret resupply operation for the rebels. He was also convicted of
lying and destroying documents to conceal the U.S. role in a 1985
shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   Poindexter's sentencing doesn't close the Iran-Contra affair. A
newly-empaneled federal grand jury is trying to determine the
precise roles of Reagan, then-Vice President George Bush, CIA
officers and others in the case. The grand jury probe is being
conducted by the office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh.
   Poindexter, 53, a retired Navy rear admiral, made no statement
in court and showed little emotion, except to smile at his wife,
Linda, after the sentence was imposed. The couple kissed and walked
arm-in-arm out of the courtroom.
   Outside the U.S. District Courthouse, Poindexter briefly joined
a throng of about 30 demonstrators who held placards urging
President Bush to pardon the Iran-Contra defendants and fire their
prosecutor, independent counsel Walsh.
   His car drove off to the strains of ``Anchors Aweigh,'' which
was broadcast over loudspeakers set up by the demonstrators, who
chanted ``Full pardon now.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on
the sentence. Asked if he would rule out a pardon by President
Bush, Fitzwater said: ``I can rule out having any comment on this
matter while the case is under appeal.''
   Greene said Poindexter violated ``a principle fundamental to
this constitutional republic _ that those elected by and
responsible to the people shall make important policy decisions.''
   ``It is unfortunate that, whatever may be his view of his own
purposes and actions, the defendant still gives no evidence or
recognizing that principle and the seriousness of its violation,''
the judge said.
   The judge did not impose any fine, saying Poindexter had already
amassed large legal bills. The former national security adviser was
allowed to remain free pending appeal of his conviction.
   Defense attorney Richard W. Beckler urged Greene to show
leniency because of Poindexter's 33 years of service as a Navy
officer.
   ``He cared for his country, he cared for his family,'' Beckler
said. ``All his life he set an example of dedication of service to
his country.''
   Prosecutor Dan K. Webb ``there is nothing about this man's
background that would have predicted ... he would have committed
five serious felony offenses. Yet, the jury's verdict stands as a
monument to that fact.''
   Afterward, Webb said the term imposed by Greene was ``a very
fair and very proper sentence'' that would warn other public
officials.
   Both the judge and Webb noted that Poindexter sought leniency
without expressing any regrets or remorse.
   Greene said that under sentencing guidelines that took effect
after the Iran-Contra affair, Poindexter could have been sentenced
to between 21 and 27 months.
   But the judge said that it would be unfair to impose that long a
sentence while other Iran-Contra defendants ``received the benefits
of probation, community service or fine.''
   North drew 1,200 hours of community service and a $150,000 fine,
and Robert McFarlane, Poindexter's predecessor as national security
adviser, received two years' probation, a $20,000 fine and 200
hours of community service.

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
criticizing the Bush administration's Cambodia policy, says he's
determined to find out if any American money is reaching the Khmer
Rouge.
   Mitchell said Congress passed a law in 1985 that bars the Khmer
Rouge from getting any military help _ direct or indirect _ from
the United States.
   ``It appears that there is reason to question whether this law
is being obeyed,'' Mitchell said, adding that the Senate
Intelligence Committee plans to hold oversight hearings into U.S.
policy on Cambodia and the administration's compliance with the law.
   The administration has denied that the Khmer Rouge benefits from
U.S. aid. But President Bush said last month he ordered a review of
U.S.-Cambodia policy, saying he was troubled by the perception that
the United States is aiding the Khmer Rouge.
   ``To the degree it has any effect to help them, yes, I am
uncomfortable about that,'' he told reporters.
   Mitchell's attack Monday is the third time he has sparred with
the administration in recent weeks.
   ``In the literal sense of the word, the Bush administration's
Cambodia policy is incredible, it is insupportable and it must be
changed,'' Mitchell said.
   Last week the Maine Democrat criticized President Bush for
granting trade benefits to the Soviet Union without obtaining
concessions on Lithuania, and he has vowed to try to thwart
extension of a trade pact with China because of that country's
human rights policies.
   China is also involved in Cambodia, Mitchell said.
   ``It is time to admit that China does not share our goals in
Cambodia,'' he said. ``It is time for American policy to reflect
American goals.''
   The Chinese are the prime sponsors of the Khmer Rouge, the group
that committed genocide in the 1970s, he said. The Khmer Rouge were
driven from power by the Vietnamese.
   The Khmer Rouge, along with two non-communist factions, have
been trying to oust the Vietnamese-installed government.
   The United States provides non-lethal assistance to two
non-communist guerrilla groups in Cambodia, one headed by Prince
Sihanouk and the other by Son Sen.
   Mitchell said the non-communists, like the Khmer Rouge, also get
support from the Chinese. ``Joined in a coalition, they do not
fight against the Khmer Rouge, they fight with the Khmer Rouge,''
he said.
   ``Increasingly there are reports of tactical and strategic
military cooperation between Sihanouk's forces and the Khmer
Rouge,'' he said. Moreover, ``it is alleged that all factions share
intelligence information during battlefield operations,'' he said.
   Mitchell said the United States is making a big mistake by
refusing to talk with the Hun Sen government. ``The current regime
is not ideal. But it is not the Khmer Rouge.''
   Mitchell urged the administration to use its influence to
divorce the non-communists from the Khmer Rouge, to state that it
will not support any future government that includes the Khmer
Rouge and to ease restrictions of U.S. development aid for the
Cambodians.
   He also said the Khmer Rouge should be stripped of their
representation of Cambodia at the United Nations.
   The State Department has said it opposes any return to power of
the Khmer Rouge, but the Cambodians themselves must determine their
future in fair and free elections.
   The United States supports a comprehensive settlement in
Cambodia, which involves a major role for the United Nations.

lack of legal force, background on Yeltsin and Gorbachev, more

   The vast Russian republic proclaimed its
sovereignty today with a declaration that signaled a sharp break
with the central Soviet government but carried no legal force.
   Deputies of the Russian Congress, who overwhelmingly approved
the declaration, stressed the move does not amount to a declaration
of independence like that of the breakaway Baltic republic of
Lithuania.
   ``We didn't declare ourselves a separate government from the
U.S.S.R.,'' said Ruslan Khasbulatov, the Congress' deputy chairman.
``We think our Russian fate should be within the framework of the
U.S.S.R.''
   The lawmakers last month elected as the republic's president
Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist reformer who backs a more radical
shift to a market economy than Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   There was no immediate reaction by Gorbachev, who has warned
that the Kremlin cannot carry out its reforms if the Russian
heartland is not firmly behind it.
   Yeltsin had urged quick passage of the measure so that June 12
could become ``Russia's independence day.'' The vote was 907-13,
and the result was met with applause and a standing ovation.
Yeltsin stood and applauded the deputies.
   Earlier in the day, deputies voted 704-206 not to drop the
``Soviet Socialist'' from the republic's formal name: The Russian
Soviet Federated Socialist Republic.
   Today's declaration does not actually have any effect on the
laws of Russia, by far the largest of the country's 15 republics,
comprising two-thirds of the country's territory and just over half
its population. The declaration is, however, the basis for writing
a new Russian constitution.
   Passing a declaration that carried legal force, Khasbulatov
said, ``would have called forth a big crash.''
   The declaration ``solemnly proclaims the state sovereignty of
the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic on all its
territory'' and says laws of the Russian Federation should have
priority over centrally dictated Soviet laws.
   The declaration says the republic has the right to secede from
the Soviet Union under conditions to be stated in a future
nationwide treaty. But the proclamation serves only as a political
statement of intent, with no legal weight.
   Still, it ``expresses the mood of decentralization in the
country,'' said Vyacheslav Maslennikov, a consultant for the
Congress' editorial commission.
   The Russian action falls far short of secessionist drives in the
Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
   The three Baltic presidents formed a united front last month to
press their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years
ago when forcibly annexed.
   Lithuania has gone the farthest toward secession by declaring
its immediate independence on March 11.
   A radical Russian deputy, Mikhail Maley, said his wing ``had a
great desire to pass a real declaration'' of sovereignty, but
conceded that lawmakers would not have accepted such a move.
   Yeltsin, elected to the republic's presidency last month, has
been a strong proponent of Russian sovereignty. He included it in
his platform and predicted it would be declared in the first 100
days of his tenure.
   ``I think it has great political significance for our
government,'' Khasbulatov, a strong supporter of Yeltsin, said of
the declaration. ``It's an extraordinary event for our country, for
our Russia.''
   Eventually, he said, Russia would ``go on our own ideas,''
especially in the area of economic reform. He said the Russian
government hoped to take control of its own foreign trade.
   Yeltsin, who has become Gorbachev's political nemesis in the
last two years, has said he hopes to cooperate with the Soviet
president despite their personal and political differences, but
that his first priority is defending Russia's interests.
   Gorbachev, who had opposed Yeltsin's election as president of
the Russian republic, indicated last week he would seek a
reconciliation with him.
   ``What would disturb me more than anything at this stage is a
split in the democratic forces,'' he said. That implied that he
viewed Yeltsin as an ally in the reform movement.

<HEAD>Death Toll in Central Asia Unrest Now 139</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Protesters have clashed with police in a Central
Asian republic, where the death toll in ethnic fighting has risen
to 139, the official Tass news agency said today.
   In recent days, Soviet media reports from the Soviet republic of
Kirghizia had said the unrest between Kirghiz and Uzbeks was
subsiding.
   But Tass said a new clash occurred Monday night when youths in
Frunze, the capital of Kirghizia, pelted police with stones and
bottles. Several of the youths were detained, it said. No injuries
were reported.
   As of late Saturday, 107 deaths had been reported, with the
situation in western Kirghizia reported in the state-controlled
newspapers and television to be returning to normal.
   By today, however, the Kirghiz Interior Ministry said 139 people
had been killed and 486 wounded, Tass reported. It did not detail
any major clashes in the intervening days.
   Tass reported again today that ``the situation is stabilizing,''
with residents staging counter-demonstrations and discussing how to
resolve the crisis.
   Soviet officials said the violence began June 2, with fighting
between the two Sunni Moslem groups flaring on June 4 in the border
city of Osh, a city of 210,000.
   Uzbeks, who make up one-third of the population, discovered that
Kirghiz were being given parcels of land for housing. Housing is
critically short in the densely populated region of Central Asia.
   The fighting spread to districts around Osh, and thousands of
troops were sent in to reinforce the local police.
   Soviet troops sealed off the border to prevent thousands of
Uzbeks from crossing into Kirghizia to join the battle, and curfews
were imposed in the region, including Osh, Frunze and border areas
inside neighboring Uzbekistan.
   At least 500 acts of arson were committed, Soviet media
reported. Kirghiz Prime Minister Apas Dzhumagulov said all houses
would be rebuilt in a few months if life returns to normal, Tass
reported.
   Dzhumagulov met Sunday with Uzbek Prime Minister Shukurulla
Mirsaidov and they pledged that the instigators of the unrest
``will be severely prosecuted,'' Tass reported.

   Tempers flared on the Senate floor over the
Supreme Court's decision to allow flag burning as Republican and
Democratic leaders debated renewed calls for a constitutional
amendment.
   Shortly after Monday's ruling, Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
urged action this week on a constitutional amendment protecting the
flag from desecration and suggested that those who oppose it side
with flag burners.
   ``I'll place my money on the young men and young women who serve
in American's armed services,'' Dole said. ``The rest can place
their money on the Jennifer Campbells and the others involved in
this flag-burning case.''
   Campbell, 23, of Seattle, was one of four defendants accused
last fall of violating a law against flag burning that Democrats
guided through Congress last year to avoid a constitutional
amendment.
   As many predicted it would, the Supreme Court on Monday
overturned the statute as an unconstitutional violation of First
Amendment guarantees of freedom of expression.
   ``We pointed out that it would never work,'' Dole said of the
1989 law. ``It's not as if we have to go back and reinvent the
wheel. We've had the debate; we're ready to take up the
constitutional amendment.''
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine accused Dole
of demeaning those who on principle oppose opening the Constitution
up to what in effect would be the first change in the Bill of
Rights.
   ``The question before us is whether or not after 200 years, the
American Bill of Rights _ the most concise, the most eloquent, the
most effective statement of individual liberty in all of human
history _ is to be changed,'' Mitchell said.
   ``You can debate the issue vigorously ... without suggesting for
a moment that the Senate is choosing between Jennifer Campbell and
the men and women in our military service,'' he added. ``No such
choice is before the Senate ... or the country.''
   Dole turned his back to Mitchell, walked to the rear of the
Senate chamber and conferred with an aide as the Democratic leader
continued his remarks.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., later took up Mitchell's theme,
calling Dole's request for Senate action this week ``the fast food
school of constitutional amendments.''
   ``Some would rather debate symbols than reality ... that we have
mortgaged our children and our children's children, ... that the
United States has fallen behind Japan and Europe in our
competitiveness,'' Leahy said.
   Mitchell said he wanted to confer with several people, including
Dole and House leaders, before deciding when to allow the Senate to
consider a flag-burning amendment.
   Amending the Constitution would require support from 67 of the
100 senators and 290 of the 435 representatives. It would then have
to be ratified by the legislatures of at least 38 states.

   A 17-year-old Israeli going to pray at the
Western Wall was stabbed twice in the stomach today in the walled
Old City, authorities said. A police roundup of Palestinian
suspects set off more violence.
   The incidents came the day after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
won a vote of confidence in Parliament for his new right-wing
government. Cabinet members today promised new steps to put down
the 2{-year-old Palestinian uprising.
   Israel radio reported that the new defense minister, Moshe
Arens, began consulting high-ranking army officers today on how to
end the uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The new foreign minister, David Levy, suggested the army could
withdraw from the occupied lands as part of a peace settlement. But
he repeated the new government's opposition to Palestinian demands
for statehood in the territories.
   The new government's agriculture minister, Rafael Eitan, who led
Israel's forces in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon, suggested on army
radio that more Palestinians be deported.
   ``Instead of shooting at children you have to deport those
responsible, the inciters, the organizers,'' he said. Since the
start of the uprising in December 1987, 60 Arabs have been expelled
to neighboring Lebanon.
   After today's stabbing in Jerusalem, police seized up about 100
Palestinians near Damascus Gate, one of the main entrances to the
Old City, said Jersualem police commander Arieh Bibi.
   The arrests set off a spate of stone-throwing at Israeli cars on
Sultan Suleiman Street just outside the city walls, but no injuries
were reported.
   The victim, identified as Yosef Edri, was in moderate condition
at Sharei Tzadek Hospital, spokeswoman Orna Cohen said. He is a
student at a yeshiva, or Jewish seminary, and is from Dimona in
Israel's Negev Desert.
   Bibi told Israel radio that police had recovered the knife.
   In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, meanwhile, soldiers destroyed
three houses of Palestinians accused of throwing firebombs or
killing suspected Arab collaborators and sealed two other homes of
Palestinian suspects.
   One of the suspects, 25-year-old Abdel Hakim Shana, was
convicted of murdering alleged collaborators and sentenced to life
imprisonment. Soldiers tore down the four-room house owned by his
father, which was home to a family of 12.
   The Supreme Court rejected appeals from some families of the
suspects. U.S. policy opposes the demolition of houses as an unfair
collective punishment.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories said there has been a marked decline in recent months
in destruction of houses by the army.
   It said that through the end of May a total of 293 houses were
destroyed and 173 sealed for security reasons. Several hundred
others have been destroyed for being built without a permit.

   A constitutional amendment for a casino
gambling pilot project has gained a spot on the November ballot in
Ohio.
   Secretary of State Sherrod Brown announced on Monday that the
Let Us Vote Ohio Committee submitted 318,899 valid signatures on
its initiative petitions, 12,238 more than required by law. The
group gathered the minimum number of signatures required from 44 of
the state's 88 counties.
   If approved by voters statewide, the referendum would allow the
City Council in Lorain _ a Lake Erie port town about 30 miles west
of Cleveland _ to place a referendum on the local ballot proposing
a five-year pilot project casino.
   After that time, the Legislature could end the project or create
seven additional resorts districts in Cleveland, Columbus,
Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton, Youngstown and Steubenville.
   ``We think it's the responsible approach, to stick your toe in
the water and not go, as they did in Atlantic City, whole hog,''
said backer Alan Spitzer.
   Representatives of the horse racing industry and some churches
already have lined up in opposition.

   Richard M. Nixon will be joined by President
Bush and former presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan at next
month's opening of his presidential library.
   Bush, Ford and Reagan will attend the July 19 dedication at
Yorba Linda, 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Former President
Carter declined the invitation, citing a previous commitment.
   Hugh Hewitt, director of the Nixon library foundation, said
Monday that he had not received White House confirmation that Bush
would attend. The Los Angeles Times, citing an administration

   The privately funded library on the site where Nixon was born in
1913 opens almost 17 years after he resigned in the wake of the
Watergate scandal.
   The gathering would mark the first time since Bush was elected
that the four living Republican presidents have met.
   The 8,400-square-foot library will house replicas of Nixon's
White House papers, materials from his congressional terms, private
papers and White House diaries.

   Government troops and Tamil rebels
have agreed to a cease-fire in northeastern Sri Lanka, government
and rebel officials said today.
   Fighting has raged for two days between government forces and
the Tamil Tigers for two days in the Batticaloa and Ampara
districts in northeastern Sri Lanka. Witnesses said more than 85
people were killed.
   The clashes were the worst since a cease-fire was declared in
Sri Lanka 13 months ago between the rebels and the government of
President Ranasinghe Premadasa. The new truce was to take effect
Wednesday.
   Government officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the
agreement had been reached in negotiations by Justice Minister
Shahul Hameed and Tamil Tiger in Jaffna, a Tiger stronghold in
northern Sri Lanka.
   A Tiger spokesman, contacted by telephone in Jaffna and also
speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the agreement.
   Tamil rebels, a minority in Sri Lanka, are fighting for more
political autonomy. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Sinhalese comprise 75 percent.
   Journalists and residents contacted by telephone in Batticaloa
on Tuesday said the dead in fighting that began Sunday included 30
Tamil civilians in the villages of Chavalakadai and Chadayantalawa.
   Batticaloa residents said the city was deserted and that
transportation was halted and shops, businesses and schools were
shut down. They reported heavy fire by helicopter gunships.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the northeastern districts
after Indian peacekeeping forces withdrew in March. Premadasa's
government, which has been negotiating with the Tigers for the past
year, requested the Indians' departure.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,200 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil war since it started in 1983. Another
6,000 people have been killed since 1987 in a backlash to Tamil
demands whipped up by Sinhalese guerrillas.

   Algerians cast ballots today in the
country's first contested elections since French rule ended in
1962, but some opposition parties contended the voting was rigged
and urged a boycott.
   The main challenge to the National Liberation Front, which has
held sole power since this North African country gained its
independence, was expected to come from the fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front.
   Police were deployed throughout the country, but there were no
reports of violence.
   Authorities said the heavy police presence was to protect
voters, but they also feared violent street protests if the
fundamentalists failed to win a majority.
   Other opposition parties looked for a low turnout among the
country's 13 million eligible voters as an indication of support
for their boycott call.
   They claimed the election was rigged in favor of the National
Liberation Front because the ruling party controls nearly all the
media, has greater resources than other parties to help get out the
vote, and has its functionaries in the local government offices
where the votes will be counted.
   In all, 11 parties were contesting the election, which is to
fill nearly 15,000 seats on 1,541 municipal councils and 48
provincial councils.
   Elections for the National People's Assembly, or parliament, are
not scheduled until 1993 but President Chadli Bendjedid could
decide to advance the date for parliamentary elections depending on
the outcome of the municipal voting.
   Until recently, the National Liberation Front was the country's
only legal political party. Its candidates continue to enjoy access
to state funds, office space and the media, although there have
been official efforts to assist the new parties.
   The National Liberation Front is an old-line Marxist party born
out of the Algerian independence struggle. It has abandoned its
efforts to turn Algeria into a one-party socialist state. Although
the Front takes note of Islam as a major tradition in Algeria, it
has steered clear of fundamentalism.
   The Islamic Salvation Front, the best organized among the new
parties, wants to establish the Islamic legal code, the Sharia, as
law and openly opposes the democratic process.
   ``We expect the people to give us 75 percent of the vote,'' said
Islamic Salvation Front leader Ali Madani, a philosophy teacher.
   Hundreds of university faculty members wrote a letter to
Algerian newspapers denouncing Madani's remarks as a provocation.
   Some of the country's most important opposition political groups
were either barred from the elections or calling for a nationwide
boycott. The opposition covers a broad political spectrum,
including communists, social democrats and conservatives.
   The Algerian Popular Party, the National Liberation Front's main
rival during the independence struggle against France, was among
several parties refused official recognition by the government and
barred from fielding candidates.
   Two other opposition parties, the Front of Socialist Forces and
the Movement for Democracy in Algeria, chose not to run and instead
called for an election boycott.
   The Movement for Democracy is a leftist populist group headed by
former President Ahmed Ben Bella, who was forced out of office by a
military coup n 1965 and now lives in exile in Switzerland.
   The Front of Socialist Forces is headed by Berber leader Ait
Ahmed, a historic figure in the country's liberation struggle. It
is a middle-of-the-road group that places strong emphasis on
preserving the Berber language.
   Many Algerian women have little say in the elections. Under the
country's Islamic family code, any man can vote on behalf of his
wife, or wives, without producing a document authorizing him to do
so.
   The attitude of the 120,000-strong Algerian military could prove
decisive for the country's political future.
   The fundamentalists have called for the military to intervene to
establish an Islamic republic, but senior army officers seem more
likely to support a state free of religious interference.

<HEAD>Rebel Leader, Government Delegation Arrive for Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and rebel leaders traveled
to neighboring Malawi today for their first direct peace talks
aimed at ending a 13-year-old civil war, the national news agency
reported.
   Afonso Dhlakama, commander of the Mozambique National Resistance
known by its Portuguese acronym RENAMO, arrived in Malawi's capital
Blantyre, the AIM news agency said.
   The delegation of the leftist government included Transport
Minister Armando Guebaza and Foreign Minister Pascoal Mocumbi, both
members of the Political Bureau of the ruling FRELIMO Party, AIM
said.
   ``By midday, all the actors in the drama were present in
Blantyre, although the talks had not yet begun,'' AIM said.
   Also in Blantyre to mediate the talks were government officials
from Kenya and Zimbabwe.
   Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi and President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe arranged several indirect, low-level meetings last year
aimed at bringing the two sides to the negotiating table.
   Earlier today, a spokesman for the guerrillas in Lisbon,
Portugal, denied that RENAMO would hold talks in Malawi.
   ``We are prepared to meet anytime, anywhere, except Malawi,''
Manuel Frank told the independent TSF radio station in Lisbon.
   RENAMO had said it would prefer talks in Kenya or Portugal,
which ruled Mozambique until 1975.
   The war has claimed an estimated 600,000 lives and turned the
southeast African nation into one of the poorest countries in the
world. Almost half of Mozambique's 15 million people require food
assistance and the annual per capita income is less than $200.
   The rebels are active throughout Mozambique, waging hit-and-run
attacks on both military and civilian targets. They have been
accused of committing atrocities against civilians.
   No government acknowledges supporting the rebels, although South
Africa openly backed them in the early 1980s, and the
white-minority government of Rhodesia helped them until it became
black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   The rebels have demanded recognition by the government and free
elections in Mozambique, but their political aims have never been
clear.
   Chissano's government officially dropped its Marxist label last
year and has moved away from its socialist-oriented economy toward
a more market-oriented system in recent years.
   The government has proposed a new constitution to allow
elections in which independents could challenge candidates from
Chissano's ruling party, the Front for the Liberation of
Mozambique. However, the government has refused to allow opposition
parties.
   The government receives most of its military aid from the Soviet
Union, but it also has developed good relations with the West in
recent years. The United States is the leading donor of food aid in
Mozambique.

<HEAD>Bush Renews Call for United Germany in NATO `With No Conditions'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 9 grafs with Bush comments on latest Gorbachev
proposal; picks up 4th graf pvs, De Maiziere said ...</NOTE>

   President Bush said anew today that a united
Germany must belong to NATO without conditions, and not the
associate membership suggested by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   But Bush, at the outset of a meeting with Republican
congressional leaders, said he stood ready to listen and discuss
``without rancor'' any ideas the Soviets have for solving the
dispute over the future of Germany.
   Gorbachev suggested in a speech today to the Supreme Soviet
legislature that he could accept a German ``associative
participation'' in NATO, provided that there were no changes in the
``mutual obligations'' that East Germany now has to the East bloc
and West Germany to NATO. Gorbachev also said the two military
alliances both must be transformed from their Cold War status.
   Bush, fielding a question from reporters, indicated that the
Gorbachev proposal was not new, but had come up during the
superpower summit here two weeks ago.
   ``Our position is well known to him, which is that a unified
Germany should be in NATO with no conditions,'' said the president,
who was observing his 66th birthday today. ``But the more talking
we do, the more convinced I am that they will see that what we're
proposing is more stabilizing and is best for the Soviet Union as
well as Western Europe and Eastern Europe.''
   ``So we'll keep on trying,'' Bush added. ``But these ideas, let
them float them out there and we'll listen and we'll discuss them
without rancor.''
   Bush met Monday with East Germany's first non-communist leader,
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere, who said afterwards that NATO
must be ``significantly changed'' if Soviet concerns about
membership for a united Germany are to be met.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the United States
believes ``considerable progress'' has been made in persuading
Gorbachev that a unified Germany inside the Western alliance will
not threaten Soviet security or European peace.
   ``I made clear to him what psychological difficulties this would
signify,'' de Maiziere said after his Oval Office meeting with
Bush. ``I made clear to him that it must be a significantly changed
NATO in order to be acceptable to our East European neighbors.''
   De Maiziere said he and Bush agreed that creating a new, lasting
and stable security order in Europe is possible only ``if the role
of the Soviet Union is written into it.''
   The prime minister added that membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization for a united Germany ``is only thinkable'' if a
treaty clearly defines the status of Soviet troops now stationed in
East Germany.
   It remains open whether such a treaty should be between NATO and
the Warsaw Pact or between Germany and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   De Maiziere said Bush insisted that questions over such a treaty
would have to be resolved by the countries negotiating the
unification of East and West Germany.
   A White House statement said Bush and de Maiziere agreed that a
united Germany ``should enjoy full sovereignty from the time of its
unification, with no discriminatory constraints on its sovereignty,
and that Germany should be free to choose its own alliance
arrangements.''
   The March election of De Maiziere, chairman of the East German
Christian Democratic Union, replaced a once rigidly communist
regime. He now heads a government rapidly moving to unify with West
Germany. He was responsible for church affairs in the government of
Hans Modrow, the last communist leader.
   Fitzwater said Bush stressed his belief that a united Germany's
membership in NATO is essential for European security and will pose
no threat to the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has said he is unwilling to accept continued German
membership in NATO on grounds it is a U.S.-led, anti-Soviet
military alliance. He wants a united Germany to belong to both the
Warsaw Pact and NATO.
   But Fitzwater said Gorbachev's summit meeting with Bush this
month, and later assurances offered by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, may be helping to change Gorbachev's mind.
   ``It's clear that this is going to be a gradual process ... I
can't report any conclusion to the matter, but we do feel progress
is going to be made,'' the spokesman said.
   De Maizierie said he took his reception by Bush, the first
between an American president and an East German leader, as ``an
honor to the people of my country who won their freedom in a
peaceful, democratic revolution.''
   Bush told White House visitors that the East German prime
minister was clearly moved by his visit, an event that would have
been all but unthinkable at the height of the Cold War.
   ``He was so emotional about it. He had never been here,'' the
president said, describing his meeting with de Maiziere as
``wonderful.''

   A bus carrying rock-'n'-roller Chubby
Checker struck a semi-tractor trailer early this morning. Checker
was not among the five people injured, authorities said.
   ``He's on there,'' said Charles Lynch, a supervisor for the
Oklahoma Department of Transportation, referring to Checker. ``He's

hurt.''
   Lynch said he was told the bus slammed into the rear end of an
18-wheeler.
   Five people were being treated for minor injuries at the Love
County Health Center in Marietta, said hospital spokesman Richard
Barker. ``We did not treat Mr. Checker, so evidently he was not
injured,'' Barker added.
   The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the 5:45 a.m. accident involved
a semi-tractor trailer and a bus carrying 12 passengers. The
accident closed both southbound lanes of Interstate 35 just north
of the Texas border.
   Checker gained international fame three decades ago as the man
who popularized the dance known as the ``twist.'' He reportedly was
en route from Chicago to San Antonio when the accident occurred.

   The weather improved today and divers should be
able to begin patching a 90-foot gash in a cruise ship off Cape
Cod, the Coast Guard said.
   Cleanup crews had been waiting for calmer seas and clearer
weather to unload thousands of gallons of diesel before repairs
began. But the Coast Guard said today the fuel would probably be
left on board.
   ``The weather's definitely better today,'' said Petty Officer
Kelly King in Boston. ``The first thing on the agenda is to fully
check the hull and patch it up.''
   About 7,500 gallons of diesel fuel already had leaked from the
617-foot Bermuda Star, which ran onto a rocky ledge Sunday, and
some oil washed onto about five miles of a rocky shoreline of
pristine Naushon Island, the Coast Guard said.
   About 100,000 gallons of thick fuel remained on board, exposed
by a 90-by-2-foot tear, but pressure from seawater kept the oil
inside while the vessel lay at anchor, officials said.
   ``If you moved the ship now, the inertia of the sea would take
away the balancing effect we have, and it would suck the oil right
out of the tear in the ship,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Steve
Aitkins.
   Repairs and unloading were called off Monday because of rain,
fog, winds of 15 to 30 mph and 2-to-4-foot waves that endangered
repair crews, the Coast Guard said.
   ``I'm not in any rush to hurry through that,'' said Cmdr. Larry
Doyle, executive officer of the Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office
in Providence, R.I. ``The vessel is stable; it's safe.''
   The fuel spilled so far threatens wildlife in Buzzards Bay,
including the world's largest population of roseate terns, a
shorebird, experts said.
   The Bermuda Star was freed Sunday nearly 13 hours after it
strayed too close to shore and ran aground in dense fog on a cruise
from New York to Nova Scotia.
   Sunday evening, 680 passengers and about 380 crew members were
taken off the ship by ferry.
   ``There was a sudden stop and then a metallic noise, then
immediately there was an oily smell. We went out on deck and we
could see the oil coming out on the water,'' said passenger Paul
Kelly of Columbia, S.C.
   Blood and urine tests were given to key members of the crew.
Results were not immediately available.
   David Roddy, senior vice president of Bermuda Star Line Cruises
in Teaneck, N.J., said the ship's captain, Hans Lewing, was an
excellent skipper with 20 years of shipping experience.
   Lewing had been with the company for three years and had no
record of problems, Roddy said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush turned 66 today, and several
reporters trooped into the Cabinet Room wearing children's birthday
hats in honor of the occasion.
   They were rewarded with laughter and applause from Bush and the
Republican congressional leaders he was meeting with. The lawmakers
had already burst into a chorus of ``Happy Birthday'' as the first
wave of media entered the room.
   ``It's a vast improvement,'' a smiling president told the
reporters in the silly hats.
   He then gave them a birthday present: he waived his rule against
answering questions at these so-called photo opportunities.
   There was one catch.
   ``Only those wearing hats get their questions answered,'' Bush
admonished the hatless reporters in the Cabinet Room.
   Bush said he did not know if Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had sent him a birthday card. But, he added
diplomatically, ``I've got to be careful. He may well have sent
something.''
   He also fielded a query about the latest Soviet suggestion on
how to resolve East-West differences over NATO membership for a
united Germany.
   Bush was being feted with more ceremony tonight at a black-tie
GOP fund-raising event in his honor, the annual President's Dinner,
at the Washington Convention Center. Some 4,000 guests were paying
$1,500 apiece to attend the event, expected to raise several
million dollars for Senate and House GOP candidates.

<HEAD>Baker Says Administration Accepts Reluctance in Congress on Trade
Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today the Bush administration accepts the fact that Congress won't
approve a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement until Moscow loosens its grip
on Lithuania.
   Baker, making his first appearance on Capitol Hill since the
U.S.-Soviet summit ended June 3, said President Bush has made this
point to Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We do not believe that Congress will approve the commercial
agreement until the deadlock over Lithuania is broken,'' Baker told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ``That is a fact of
political life.''
   Bush said he would not send the agreement to Congress for
approval until the Soviet Union passed a law granting free
emigration to Soviet Jews and others. But he did not link the trade
pact to Lithuania.
   Many members of Congress promised to oppose the trade agreement
until the Soviet Union ended its embargo against the breakaway
Baltic republic and participated in negotiations aimed at achieving
Lithuanian independence.
   The agreement requires majority approval by both the House and
Senate.
   Baker said wide distances remain between the United States and
the Soviets regarding Lithuania. He said he wished he could report
the two superpowers' positions were close, ``but they are not.''
   At the same time he said, administration officials are
encouraged that Baltic leaders are in Moscow for talks. The
administration hopes a ``systematic dialogue'' will lead to a
peaceful resolution of the problem, he said.
   On other issues, Baker praised the recent multi-party elections
in Czechoslovakia in which pro-democracy groups received the
plurality of the votes. ``The big winner was democracy,'' Baker
said.
   But Baker said the administration was reserving judgment on what
happened in the Bulgarian elections, where the socialist party _
the former communists _ took almost half the vote.
   ``Questions about possible election-day abuses are being
explored by government and party representatives,'' Baker said.
   While Baker said the summit provided solid underpinning for
future U.S.-Soviet relations, differences remain between the two
superpowers.
   Specifically, he criticized the Soviets for continuing to
support Cuba.
   ``We are still concerned ... about Soviet support for Cuba and
Cuban support for the rebels in El Salvador,'' he said. ``Continued
Soviet military assistance for Cuba is a striking exception to the
Soviet Union's `new thinking' on regional issues.''
   Baker reiterated the U.S. position that a unified Germany should
remain in NATO. He said he believes the Soviet Union eventually
will come around to accepting this view. The Soviets now oppose
giving a unified Germany NATO membership.
   On arms control, he said the administration has been heartened
by recent Soviet statements renewing a commitment to seek a rapid
agreement on reducing conventional forces in Europe.
   Overall, Baker said, there will be aftershocks from the
momentous changes in the world in 1989. ``There will also be great
opportunities to create a more democratic, more prosperous and more
secure world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Rebel Delegation Arrives In Sierra Leone for Liberian Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation of Liberian rebels
arrived this morning for talks with government officials aimed at
ending the tribal war in the West African nation, U.S. Embassy
sources said.
   A delegation of government representatives and members of the
Liberian Council of Churches, which is to mediate the talks,
arrived Monday in Sierra Leone, Liberia's western neighbor.
   The embassy sources said the talks were to be held in the U.S.
Cultural Center auditorium, but they could not say when they would
begin.
   The talks were delayed Monday, when rebel sources said their
delegation was taking a roundabout route to avoid the danger of
attack.
   Both sides made concessions to permit the talks possible. But
the talks could be headed to an early impasse if rebels stick to
their demand that Liberian President Samuel Doe resign and leave
the country before a cease-fire can be arranged in the
five-month-old war.
   Doe agreed to send a delegation after rebels had advanced to
within 25 miles of the capital of Monrovia. His troops, unable to
halt the rebels since they invaded from the Ivory Coast on Dec. 24,
were accused of killing hundreds of civilians believed to support
the insurgents.
   The rebels had met little resistance until a week ago, when
government troops managed to retake the headquarters of the
Firestone rubber plantation.
   Doe, who had refused negotiations with the rebels as long as
Taylor, a former aide, led them, agreed to begin talks after his
troops chased the rebels from the plantation. Rebels claim to have
subsequently retaken the plantation, but its American employees
told their headquarters that it was not clear who was in control.
   Taylor had been insisting Doe surrender before any negotiations
could begin but accepted the appeal from church leaders to enter
talks. He said he would send a delegation to the talks but no
cease-fire could be arranged until Doe leaves Liberia.
   Taylor's delegation was believed to be headed by Tom Woewiyu,
who had been serving as the rebels' spokesman.
   The government delegation to the peace talks was to include

   Texas should prepare for oil spills the way
California prepares for earthquakes, a state official said as
emergency crews braced for a possibly catastrophic spill from the
Mega Borg burning in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``We've got some plans. But they're not capable of handling a
gigantic spill,'' Andy Mangan, deputy land commissioner, said
Monday.
   The 886-foot Norwegian supertanker had been carrying 38 million
gallons of light crude when explosions and fire crippled it
Saturday.
   But at the time some of the needed equipment for oil containment
and salvage was in Europe. Equipment to spray flame-choking foam
was in Louisiana.
   More powerful explosions hit Sunday, spilling blazing crude into
the Gulf and nudging the ship closer to sinking. Early today waves
were breaking over the tanker's deck. Officials estimated as much
as 100,000 gallons of oil had spilled.
   On Monday, Mangan and other state officials urged lawmakers to
unify the state's scattershot approach to dealing with spills. He
said the state should prepare for such disasters the way San
Francisco prepares for earthquakes.
   ``The focus has not been there. There hasn't been any concerted
effort to put such a contingency plan together,'' Mangan said.
   Mangan said state officials have worked closely with Alaska and
other states since the Exxon Valdez spill, the nation's worst at
nearly 11 million gallons.
   He said Texas probably is better prepared than some coastal
states but not as well prepared as it could be.
   In Florida on Monday, Gov. Bob Martinez signed what he said is
the nation's most comprehensive law for preventing and cleaning up
oil spills.
   The law, a compromise with oil shippers and retailers, requires
vessels and terminals to develop detailed spill-response plans and
terminals to buy spill-containment equipment. Among other things,
it also raises liability limits for spill damage and cleanup costs
for transporters and owners of cargo.
   Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, a member of the Governor's
Oil Spill Advisory Committee, agreed Texas has some work to do. He
said Texas ports handle 300 million tons of cargo each year, 75
percent of it oil products.
   ``This is our worst nightmare,'' Mauro said. ``We're not ready
to deal with a catastrophic oil spill off the coast.''
   The delay-plagued cleanup effort bears out Mauro's words.
   Firefighters were hoping to start battling the blaze with foam
on Sunday. But that tactic was pushed back because equipment to
spray the foam had to be brought from Louisiana, said Coast Guard
Chief Petty Officer Sam Wilson.
   Other oil containment and salvage equipment was brought from as
far away as Holland. The private companies responding to the Mega
Borg fire had their equipment overseas because there are more
offshore fires in the North Sea and Middle East than the Gulf of
Mexico, Coast Guard Adm. Williams Merlin said.
   John Sharp, Texas railroad commissioner and a member of the
Governor's Oil Spill Advisory Committee, said the Exxon Valdez
accident in 1989 had prompted state efforts to try to better
coordinate a plan.
   ``When you're talking about a spill that is possible _ the size
of an entire tanker _ I'm not sure you can make plans that are
going to always adequately cover one that size or the size of a
Valdez,'' Sharp said.
   ``What you have to do is make sure you do everything you can to
ensure they don't happen to begin with.''
   Other state officials said the response has gone well so far.
   Gov. Bill Clements said the state is ``pulling out all the
stops'' to prepare for a major spill.
   He noted that there was a meeting Monday of the State Emergency
Management Council, which includes 27 state agencies and the Red
Cross.
   Buck Wynne, chairman of the Texas Water Commission, said a
recent drill that simulated a 200,000-gallon spill in the Gulf
helped prepare the state.
   ``Hopefully, we've identified problems in coordinating a
response to a major oil spill,'' said Wynne, whose agency is part
of a regional response team that also includes the Coast Guard and
other federal agencies.
   ``I think we are as ready as we can be.''

<HEAD>Environmental Groups Sue to Block Restart of Nuclear Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two environmental groups said today they had
filed a federal lawsuit in South Carolina to try to block the
restart of a federal nuclear weapons plant closed more than two
years ago for safety reasons.
   The suit by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy
Research Foundation was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in
Columbia, said Daniel W. Reicher, an attorney for NRDC.
   The Energy Department, which owns the Savannah River Site, has
said it intends to restart the first of Savannah River's three
active reactors by next January. The plant produces tritium gas for
nuclear warheads.
   The reactors were closed in 1988 after an accident at one
facility raised troubling questions about safety standards and the
risk of mechanical failures. More than $1 billion is being spent to
upgrade the reactors and retrain workers.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has said the timetable for
restarting the plant is tentative, but that putting the reactors
back in production soon is vital to the nation's security.
   Tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a year, so the
quantities in warheads must be replenished. The government says its
stockpile of tritium is running low, although information about
tritium inventories is classified.
   A secretary in the Energy Department's public affairs office
said no one was immediately available to comment on the lawsuit.
   Reicher said the suit contends that the government should not be
permitted to restart the K reactor at Savannah River until it
completes construction of a cooling tower for water discharged from
the reactor into man-made lakes. Environmental groups contend the
water, at temperatures of up to 180 degrees, interferes with fish
migration and causes other environmental damage.
   The cooling tower is scheduled for completion in 1992.
   Reicher said the department could remain in compliance with the
federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 without finishing the
cooling tower if President Bush issued a waiver of the pollution
requirements on national security grounds.
   Bush has given no indication of whether he would grant such a
waiver.
   The weapons plant, whose reactors were built in the early 1950s,
is situated on a 315-square-mile federal reservation near Aiken,
S.C., along the Savannah River.

  Last summer, Rebecca Donovan landed her dream
job as head librarian for Hazen's three schools.
   She had spent 12 years in nearby Stanton as an English teacher
who also ran the school library, arranged the prom and sold popcorn
at basketball games.
   ``I was pregnant. At the end of the night, my feet would be
swelled up like bowling balls,'' she said, recalling those grim
days of being ``spread too thin.''
   But her joy was brief. Donovan, 37, got laid off in April.
   North Dakota cut its education budget by more than $31 million
this spring after voters rejected tax increases, and some schools
closed, others cut out art, music and home economics, and more than
300 teachers lost their contracts.
   Donovan's hopes of getting her job back may rest with North
Dakota's voters, who decide today whether to raise the sales tax
from 5 percent to 6 percent for a year to bail out education by
raising an estimated $42 million.
   John Conrad, a retired businessman who has campaigned to raise
the tax, said voters' reluctance to open their wallets wider has
harmed education.
   ``People have to look kids right square in the eye and say, `Are
these kids worth it?''' he said. Conrad has billed his campaign ``A
Penny for Our Kids.''
   Opponents said the schools will benefit by being forced to
consolidate and share. Government spending, they added, is bloated
and needs a crash diet.
   ``State government has become a monster, not a servant of the
people,'' says Republican state Sen. Bryce Streibel. ``The special
interests want to have their way _ `Let the poor sucker who's out
in the boondocks struggling along ... pay the bill.'''
   Voters rejected increases in income, sales and gasoline taxes in
December but showed the most sympathy for higher sales taxes, with
47 percent approving an increase.
   Kent French, a businessman who led the drive last year against
tax increases, argued the state budget is big enough to provide for
education. If lawmakers want to provide more, they should cut from
other areas, he said.
   ``While no one wants education to suffer, some necessary changes
are being made,'' French said. Because of the financial crunch,
North Dakotans are taking a harder look at how their school boards
manage their budgets, he and others said.
   Wayne Sanstead, state superintendent of public instruction, said
teacher morale could take a dive if the measure is voted down.
   ``I think the school administrators and the teachers are going
to wonder, `Where is the support that people talk about having?''
he said.
   The Hazen district is cutting $400,000 from its budget next
year, said Superintendent Ray Frank.
   Hazen shed the equivalent of five teaching jobs, reducing its
music and library staffs and laying off a counselor. The district
also canceled plans to hire another sixth-grade teacher, which
probably means larger classes, Frank said.
   Donovan said she is troubled by the cuts, especially when she
looks at her young son, who has shown talent at local art contests.
Offerings such as music and art are ``the only things that separate
us from the animals,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today proposed that
a united Germany could be an associate member of a transformed NATO.
   Western diplomats said Gorbachev, in his hourlong speech to the
Supreme Soviet legislature, appeared to show more flexibility on
the German question. Only days earlier, he had reiterated Soviet
opposition to NATO membership.
   Gorbachev also said the Washington summit achieved ``huge
results'' in arms control. The speech, broadcast live on Soviet TV,
gave Gorbachev the chance to highlight his area of greatest
success, foreign policy.
   His domestic policy faces increasing criticism from citizens.
The country is beset with severe economic problems, ethnic clashes
and secessionist movements.
   Speaking calmly and smiling frequently, Gorbachev told the
legislators that his warm reception in the United States and the
signing of a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement were evidence of U.S.
faith in his domestic reform program.
   Gorbachev recounted his discussions at the Washington summit
with President Bush on a united Germany joining the North Atlantic
Treat Organization, the Western military alliance. East Germany is
a member of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``Our position is thus: We could agree to the joining, if you
accept associative participation, the principle of blocs coming
together in conjunction with the unification of Germany in the
process of which mutual obligations are not changed, neither from
the side of West or East Germany, and if simultaneously the blocs
are reformed in natural connection with Vienna and the all-European
process.''
   Gorbachev did not define his concept of associate membership for
Germany. Vienna is the site of talks on arms cuts and the
Europe-wide Conference on Security and Cooperation aimed at
reducing tensions.
   Bush, asked by reporters in Washington about Gorbachev's speech
today, said, ``a unified Germany should be in NATO with no
conditions.''
   But Bush said he stands ready to listen and discuss ``without
rancor'' any ideas the Soviets have for solving the dispute over
the future of Germany.
   Official Radio Moscow explained Gorbachev's comments saying:
``it might be possible to agree with Germany being in NATO as an
associated member provided there are changes in the nature of the
military alliances, both NATO and the Warsaw Treaty organization.
   Gorbachev appeared to be demanding that a united Germany fulfill
East Germany's obligations to the Warsaw Pact only during a
transition period, when the function of the two military blocs
would change.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Gorbachev's comments appeared to signal ``positive movement'' on
the German question. But he said it was still unlikely Gorbachev's
position would be acceptable to the Western allies without further
modification.
   Previously, the Soviet Union sought membership in both NATO and
the Warsaw Pact for a united Germany.
   A West German newspaper reported Monday that, at a meeting in
Washington, East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere would
give Bush a new proprosal from Gorbachev to break the deadlock over
Germany's military allegiance.
   The Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Gorbachev would agree to NATO
membership for a united Germany if the Western alliance made ``a
clear decision to transform itself into a political alliance.''
   Speaking of the May 30-June 3 summit with Bush, Gorbachev said:
``As a whole, I think huge results were achieved in Washington
toward limiting nuclear and conventional weapons.''
   ``All this has great meaning,'' he said. ``Another practical
step was taken to realize the idea of a non-violent, non-nuclear
world.'' There is difficult work ahead, but the danger of the Cold
War has begun to recede, he said.
   Gorbachev and Bush signed agreements to eliminate the two sides'
chemical weapons and to reach a final accord this year to cut
sharply their strategic nuclear weapons.
   Speaking to the legislature, Gorbachev cited the trade bill he
signed with Bush as evidence that the ``American government indeed
has faith in us.''

<HEAD>Baker Says PLO Response Inadequate on Terrorist Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today the actions of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the
wake of an aborted terrorist attack on an Israeli beach have been
inadequate.
   But he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the United
States has not made any decision on whether to cut off dialogue
with the PLO because of the matter.
   ``We want to weigh matters carefully and do so without the
pressure of artificial deadlines,'' said Baker, noting that
suspending talks with the PLO would have far-reaching ramifications
on future Middle East peace efforts.
   Abu Abbas, a member of the PLO executive committee, claimed
responsibility for the attempted seaborne attack.
   While the PLO has disassociated itself from the attack, the
group's top leaders have given no indication that they intend to
take steps to discipline Abu Abbas, and they have not condemned the
attack directly, Baker said.
   The United States has urged the PLO to take such steps, he said.
   So far the PLO's ``public and private responses have fallen
short of the mark,'' Baker said.
   He said U.S. allies, such as Britain, have interceded with the
PLO, asking the Arab group to follow the United States' advice.
   Over two dozen members of the Senate have urged the Bush
administration to suspend the dialogue with the PLO as a result of
the attempted attack.

   Columbia returned to a hangar today
for repair of a hydrogen leak that will ground the space shuttle
until August.
   NASA started rolling Columbia off the launch pad before
daybreak. The shuttle completed the 3{-mile trip nearly six hours
later.
   Columbia was to be secured on a pedestal later today, and access
platforms were to be placed around the shuttle, said agency
spokesman George Diller.
   Columbia's flight with the $150 million Astro observatory was
called off two weeks ago when the leak was detected during fueling.
   NASA officials suspect the leak is in or near a tight cavity
between two metal plates that connect the orbiter and the external
fuel tank. The tank will have to be disconnected, a job that can
only be done at the hangar.
   Atlantis is scheduled to be taken from the hangar to the launch
pad on Saturday for a secret military mission next month.

   A leftist terrorist group today claimed
responsibility for a weekend rocket attack that damaged the offices
of a U.S. company.
   The November 17 group said it launched the Sunday attack against
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., a household products manufacturer, because it
recently bought a debt-ridden company from the government at a low
price.
   ``We will automatically consider such a move as robbing the
Greek people ... and consequently we will strike without warning,''
the group said in a letter to the Socialist daily Epikairotita.
   Authorities had already said they suspected November 17 in the
attack on an office of Cincinnati-based company. The building,
located on a main thoroughfare, was damaged but no one was injured.
   Officials said the attackers apparently used a stolen anti-tank
missile and a small World War II bazooka.
   The conservative Greek government elected in April says that it
plans to privatize or liquidate most of the 70 former private
companies operated by the state because they are losing about $1
billion annually. Labor unions have protested the move.
   Procter &amp; Gamble bought the property of a defunct Greek company
for $2.77 million at a public auction in May, said Gerassimos
Vassilatos, a company spokesman. The Greek company had a total debt
of $37.5 million, he said.
   ``Eight previous auctions failed to provoke any interest from
anybody else. The price, as a result, was lowered by the court to a
price that it considered appropriate,'' he said.
   He added that the Greek company had laid off its work force two
years ago and that the property would be used as a warehouse.
   Procter &amp; Gamble has been in Greece for 30 years and last year
did $106 million in business, Vassilatos said.
   November 17 has claimed the killings of 14 people since 1975. No
member of the group has ever been arrested.

<HEAD>Electoral Council Says Balaguer Won Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Joaquin
Balaguer won last month's election a margin of less than 25,000
votes over challenger Juan Bosch, the Central Electoral Board has
announced.
   The board issued its final official count Monday night of the
May 16 election, giving Balaguer 678,268 votes, or 35.7 percent
vote of those cast, to 653,423, or 34.4 percent, for Bosch.
   The outcome had been left hanging five days after the election
when the board suspended counting pending a review of tally sheets
in the presence of six international observers. The board acted on
the recommendation of former President Jimmy Carter, an observer.
   Leftist challenger Bosch, a former president overthrown by a
military coup in 1963, had accused conservative Balaguer of fraud.
Bosch threatened street protests and a national strike until he
agreed to the board's review.
   At the time the count was suspended, Electoral Board President
Troilan Tavares did not mention fraud, although he said officials
found errors by some polling stations in compiling tally sheets.
   There was no immediate victory statement from Balaguer or his
party, nor any public reaction overnight from Bosch to the results.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind, will assume his sixth term in office on
Aug. 16. Bosch is an 80-year-old Marxist, but says he is not a
communist and recognizes capitalism as necessary for reviving the
Dominican economy,
   Balaguer was first elected president in 1966 and served three
consecutive four-year terms before losing in 1978. He was
re-elected in 1986.
   During his current term Balaguer has undertaken a $2 billion
public works project that created thousands of jobs but fueled
inflation.
   He appeared to be in trouble before the election because of the
country's economic crisis, frequent electricity blackouts and water
shortages. Opinion polls showed Bosch leading by up to 10 points.

   French saxophone and clarinet player Hubert
Rostaing, a legend on the Paris jazz circuit in the 1940s, has died
of liver cancer, family members said. He was 71.
   He died Sunday in a Paris hospital, and funeral services will be
held Thursday.
   Born in Lyon, Rostaing learned to play the clarinet and
saxophone during a boyhood in Algiers, Algeria, and made his jazz
debut in local clubs during the 1930s.
   After moving to Paris he caught the attention of orchestra
leader Alix Combelle, for whom he performed throughout the Nazi
occupation at the celebrated Hot Club de France.
   With a clarinet style heavily influenced by Benny Goodman,
Rostaing also performed successfully throughout the 1950s. In later
years he turned his attention to composition and writing music for
films.
   It was not immediately known whether there were survivors.

   Cuban students studying at Hungarian

   Cuba remains staunchly communist, but Hungary, like other
Eastern European nations, has been swept by democratic reform.
North Korea and Vietnam, which also have hard-line governments,
brought their students home from Hungary last year.
   MTI said 70 Cuban students were affected.
   The news agency quoted students as saying they were told to

   A Cuban diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, told MTI
the students ``will be given every chance to continue their

   A top Taiwanese official on Tuesday
rejected a proposal from China for talks between their ruling
political parties on communication and trade links as steps toward
reunification.
   Tsiang Yien-si, President Lee Teng-hui's secretary general, told
reporters the talks must be between the rival governments, as
proposed earlier by Taiwan.
   Tsiang was responding to an offer made Monday by China's
Communist Party general secretary, Jiang Zemin.
   Jiang said Taiwan and China should establish trade and
communications links before the two sides hold formal talks on
reunification, but that the initial meetings must be between
China's Communist Party and Taiwan's ruling Nationalist party.
   Jiang's remarks were the Communist leadership's first detailed
response to last month's proposal by Taiwanese President Lee for
government contacts in trade, academia, science and other fields.
   Tsiang, a leading member of the Nationalist party, said Jiang's
offer failed to recognize the existence of the Nationalist
government.
   The Nationalists have ruled Taiwan, an island province of China,
since 1949 when they lost a civil war to the Communists on the
China mainland. The Nationalists continue to claim they are the
legitimate government of all China.

   A ruling party boss has urged followers to

   Wilson Leitich, chairman of the ruling Kenya African National

celebrating the ruling party's 30th birthday.
   Leitich told members of the party's youth wing to carry knives
and chop off the index and middle fingers off anyone seen giving
the opposition salute. He said they should take the fingers to the
party offices in Nakuru, in the southeastern Rift Valley.
   ``We are not cowards for them to play around with us like
that,'' the Daily Nation quoted Leitich as saying.
   That paper and the daily Standard reported the address, but
Kenya's other English-language newspaper, the ruling party's Kenya
Times, did not.
   Several prominent clergymen and former politicians have
increasingly called for a return to multiparty politics.
   Kenya has been a one-party state since 1982. Daniel arap Moi is

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's spokesman said today the
Senate's vote on overriding the veto of a $2 billion Amtrak bill
will be close, but he voiced optimism it will be sustained.
   ``We haven't lost a veto yet. We'd hate to lose a first one,''
said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The House voted last week to override the veto. Both houses must
vote to override by a two-third majorities for a measure to be
enacted over a veto.
   ``We're hopeful we will be able to sustain that vote in the
Senate. It will be close, but we're hopeful,'' he said. The Senate
was scheduled to vote tonight on the veto override.
   In vetoing the transportation authorization bill, Bush objected
to a provision expanding government regulation over railroad
aquistions. But critics accused him of vetoing the measure
primarily to kill the government's subsidy of Amtrak rail passenger
service.
   ``We have a good chance of winning,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., told reporters after he and other Republican leaders
met with Bush at the White House.
   ``Everything's on track,'' he quipped.

   Japan's finance minister suggested Tuesday that
Japanese women are having fewer babies because more of them are
going to college, according to a health official.
   The health official said the comments came during a Cabinet
discussion about a report that says Japan's birth rate reached a
record low in 1989, indicating the country could have problems in
meeting future labor force needs.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto questioned whether all young
people needed higher education, said the health official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. Hashimoto said people could study while
working.
   A government report, issued last week, said the average Japanese
woman had just 1.57 children as of 1989, an all-time low. The
previous low was 1.58 in 1966.
   The health official said Cabinet members asked Health and
Welfare Minister Yuji Tsushima to take positive measures to help
increase the birth rate.
   ``Women's higher education may also be related to the matter,''
the health official quoted Hashimoto as saying.
   He said Tsushima told the other ministers the issue was worth
studying.

<HEAD>NRC Proposes $160,000 Fine Against 3M For Leaky Ionizers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
proposed a $160,000 fine against 3M Co. for failing to fully report
radiation leaks from air guns filled with a radioactive chemical.
   ``There were more leaking devices than they informed us of,''
Jan Strasma, an NRC spokesman in Glen Ellyn, Ill., said Monday.
   The NRC cited 3M for placing the devices in ``unacceptable
environments'' and failing to give adequate handling instructions
to customers. The citations were based on 1988 inspections by the
federal agency.
   Mark Fenner, a 3M spokesman, said the company will study the
charges and respond within the allotted 30 days. The manufacturer
also has 30 days to pay or protest the fine.
   ``We are surprised by the size of the proposed penalty,'' Fenner
said.
   The NRC ordered 3M in February 1988 to recall all 52,000 of its
air ionizers _ air guns that are used to change the electrical
charges of atomic particles during manufacturing. The ionizers are
filled with polonium, a radioactive substance.
   By changing electrical charges, the devices are able to
eliminate static and dust in computer chips, chemicals or in the
air.
   Between 1,500 and 2,000 of the 3M ionizers were used by
companies that make food, beverages, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
The NRC said Monday it was unlikely that any consumer products were
contaminated or that any handlers of the devices were exposed to
significant radiation.
   The agency said its inspection identified seven violations of
its policies.
   According to the NRC summary of the inspection, 3M sales
representatives ``willfully failed, in some cases, to perform
evaluations to assure that customers would use static eliminators
only in acceptable environments which would not cause leakage.''
   Strasma said some sales were made to customers required to test
for radiation leaks but not equipped to make the tests.
   3M also failed to follow up with its customers after it
determined that its air guns were leaking, the NRC inspection
summary said.
   In addition, NRC inspectors have accused 3M of failing to report
to the NRC all results of tests performed on the ionizers for 1986
and 1987.
   Fenner said the company would not respond publicly to the
allegations until it reviews the case.

   Congressional Republicans emerged from the
White House today waving the flag, criticizing the Supreme Court
and vowing to press for quick action on a constitutional amendment
to restore special protection for the flag.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., holding a small flag in
hand, took a swipe at Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who
warned in his dissent Monday against leaders' manipulating the flag
``for partisan disputes.''
   ``As far as I know he's never run for political office,'' Dole
told reporters on the White House driveway. ``If he wants to get
out there and run, well, go right ahead. He has a right to
criticize those of us in politics, and we have a right to criticize
the court, and they're wrong.''
   ``We're not manipulating. We're going to go out and tell the
American people this is how people voted on this issue. And then we
can tell them how Justice Stevens voted in the court. Nobody would
care,'' said Dole.
   Stevens was in the minority on the 5-4 decision that overturned
the federal flag protection act. In a dissent, he wrote that the
integrity of the flag as a national symbol ``has been compromised
by those leaders who seem to advocate compulsory worship of the
flag ... (or) manipulate the symbol of national purpose into a
pretext for partisan disputes about meaner ends.''
   President Bush was renewing his call for a constitutional
amendment to protect the flag later today at a Rose Garden ceremony
in which he was receiving a replica of the Marine's famed statue of
the World War II flag-raising on Iwo Jima.
   Dole said the flag debate was very important to ``real'' people,
and ``the Democrats should give us a very quick vote.''
   ``We don't need more hearings. ... We're ready to vote on Flag
Day,'' which is Thursday, Dole said.
   Asked if he would question the patriotism of lawmakers who vote
against the constitutional amendment, Dole said no, but quipped,
``I might make a 30-second spot.''
   Congressional Democratic leaders strongly oppose amending the
Constitution to ban flag burning. But votes were being scheduled
around such symbolic days as the Fourth of July and Flag Day, June
14.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., meanwhile, said today he
would not delay a House vote on a constitutional amendment and said
it could come within two weeks. But Foley said he intended to vote
against the proposal, despite tradition that has the speaker
refrain from voting.
   ``I do not support amending the First Amendment,'' Foley said.
``Flag burning isn't worth tampering with the most important
repository of freedom any country has ever established in its
history.''
   Foley said Republican efforts to use the vote as a political
weapon against Democrats who oppose the amendment will not succeed,
and that a vote against the amendment ``will not be one that leads
to any political embarrassment.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on the Constitution and a leading House opponent of an
amendment, predicted an amendment would fail again.
   ``I'm confident we're going to get enough members to stand up
and say, `No, I love the Bill of Rights,''' Edwards said.
   With flag burning no longer a federal crime since the court's
action, some said a vote for a constitutional ban would be
politically irresistible just a few months before the fall
congressional elections. Republicans hoped so.
   ``Certainly the vote on the constitutional amendment will become
a campaign issue,'' said Ed Rollins, head of the House Republican
campaign committee.
   ``It's a good issue to define your opponent,'' Rollins said.
``If your opponent is for flag burning, he's got to go through a
very sophisticated explanation of why he is.''
   Democrats were aware of the political pitfalls the issue poses
for them, recalling how George Bush exploited the flag's patriotic
values at Michael Dukakis's expense in his 1988 campaign.
   ``It will be very tempting to play politics with it, with the
Fourth of July,'' said Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a fierce
opponent of a constitutional change.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown warned his potential
candidates away from turning the fall campaign into a contest for
patriotism. He urged all Democratic candidates ``not to seek any
political gain by challenging their opponents' patriotism or
position on the flag amendment.''
   Brown said the flag and Bill of Rights were ``more important
than any political tug of war.''
   But some backers of a flag-burning ban acknowledged public
support for the issue may have dropped since the dispute was
temporarily defused last fall with passage of the now-overturned
law.
   ``I think candidly it will be a difficult vote,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, who backs a
constitutional amendment. ``It's not going to happen
automatically.''
   Opponents of the amendment argue that the Bill of Rights and its
First Amendment protection of free speech are too sacred to tamper
with because of a few dissenters who burn flags to gain publicity
for themselves or their cause.
   An amendment to prohibit burning the American flag would temper
the First Amendment by saying the right of free speech excluded
burning the flag as a form of political expression. The Bill of
Rights, comprising the first 10 amendments, has never actually been
amended.
   The proposed amendment was scheduled for a vote next week in the
House Judiciary Committee, where Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
supports it.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee and an author of the law, said, ``We are left with no
other option but a constitutional amendment.'' He said he would
begin hearings and try to write an amendment ``that doesn't do
violence'' to the First Amendment.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, an opponent, said he
would move more slowly.
   ``The issue is not the flag. The issue is whether we are going
to amend the Bill of Rights,'' Mitchell said.
   To be added to the Constitution, the amendment needs two-thirds
majorities in both the Senate and House and approval by 38 of the
50 state legislatures.

<HEAD>Saving Soup Labels to Get Free Van</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of families looking for a way to
transport their children to a Catholic school have collected nearly
a million Campbell Soup Co. product labels needed to get a free van.
   Diana Goebel, who's heading the drive, said Monday that 994,000
labels had been collected. Friday's the deadline. The group
gathered 150,000 labels in the campaign's first eight months and
more than 764,000 in the last four months.
   The late rush of labels bordered on the miraculous, Goebel said.
   ``It was like the loaves and fishes, only they were Campbell's
Soup labels,'' she said, referring to the New Testament story of
Jesus feeding 5,000 men, plus women and children, with just five
loaves of bread and two fish.
   ``It just seemed like it was an impossibility,'' Goebel said of
the group's efforts. ``The way I figured it, if the good Lord
wanted it to happen, it will happen. All we had to do was work
hard.''
   And she did.
   With more than 50,000 labels a week pouring into her mailbox
during the last couple of months, Goebel spent 15 hours a day
clipping and packaging labels.
   ``I've got blisters and calluses,'' she said.
   Goebel said she received labels from more than 150 Minnesota
communities, at least 35 states, and from Italy, Canada, Mexico,
Asia and the Bahamas. The effort got a lift in February, when it
attracted national attention.
   But the 15-seat, $20,000 van won't solve their problem; it will
be too small for the 20 students who ride a rickety 1971 school
bus. Instead, the group plans to sell the van and use the money to
buy a new or used 48-passenger bus.
   On Friday, Goebel and her supporters from Jordan _ a town of
about 3,000 people about 20 miles southwest of the Twin Cities _
plan to pack the labels into the old bus and travel 50 miles to a
Campbell's office in Monticello, where the labels will be counted.
   Under Campbell's 18-year-old Labels for Education program,
schools can redeem labels from Campbell's products for
school-related equipment. During the last three years, several
schools nationwide have turned in enough labels to earn vans, the
company said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The disintegrating Warsaw Pact
should be preserved in some form to prevent the Soviet Union from
becoming dangerously isolated, Czechoslovakia's foreign minister
said Tuesday.
   The minister, Jiri Dienstbier, said the Warsaw Pact is moving
away from its role as a military alliance but can still play a role
in European affairs.
   The Warsaw Pact, led by the Soviet Union, sent tanks into
Czechoslovakia to crush the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   But now Czechoslovakia wants to remain in the alliance so it can
have a voice in negotiating disarmament and a new European security
order, Dienstbier said.
   ``For the first time, the Warsaw Pact is useful to us,'' he said
in an interview with The Associated Press and two other news
organizations.
   The foreign minister was considered certain to keep his post in
the new Czechoslovak government being formed after weekend
elections won by the pro-democracy forces that led last year's
revolution.
   Dienstbier, recalling the isolation of Germany following World
War I, said of the Soviets: ``We should do everything to pull them
into Europe.''
   ``We don't want to create any Versailles complex in Russia,'' he
said, referring to the treaty that punished Germany at the end of
World War I. ``It's even more dangerous because they have all those
nuclear arms.''
   The Warsaw Pact was created in 1955 and had always been
dominated by the Soviets until the dramatic changes that swept
eastern Europe last year.
   Pact members met in Moscow last week, and the Soviets agreed
that the other six member nations should have command of their own
armies.
   They had nominal command before. But with the exception of
Romania' refusal to join the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, they
had never exercised it. The supreme military commander of the
Warsaw Pact was always a top Soviet general or marshal.
   ``Even the Warsaw Pact military command was not important,''
Dienstbier said. ``It was just subordinated to the Soviet army.''
   Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Poland want the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe to make its headquarters in
Prague. The 35-nation group includes the United States, the Soviet
Union, Canada and all of Europe except Albania.
   Under the three-nation proposal, a parallel center for arms
control, verification and confidence-building measures also would
be established in Berlin.
   The three east European nations want their idea discussed at a
meeting of the Conference on Security in Vienna July 10. That
meeting is to pave the way for a Paris summit in December.
   Dienstbier and Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel have long
advocated the eventual break-up of the Warsaw Pact and its Western
counterpart, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Unlike Hungary's new leaders _ who want their country out of the
Pact _ Dienstbier and Havel say the East bloc alliance should break
up only gradually. Meantime, they want to remain members.
   Dienstbier said there are ``positive forces in the Soviet
Union'' who want to work with Czechoslovakia, East Germany and
Poland on transforming European security.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told President
Bush in Washington Monday that NATO must be ``significantly
changed'' to meet the Soviet Union's security concerns.
   The West is insisting that a united Germany be a member of NATO.
Moscow wants the new country to either be neutral or a member of
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   De Maiziere said a united Germany would consider membership in
NATO only if a treaty clearly defined the status of Soviet troops
now stationed in East Germany.

   A loaded coal train slammed into a car,
killing four members of a family and leaving a fifth in critical
condition, authorities said.
   The accident occurred Monday afternoon at a crossing about
one-half mile east of Seneca, a ranching community of about 100
people in the Nebraska Sandhills.
   ``I don't know how it happened,'' Thomas County Attorney Warren
Arganbright said. ``He was not going fast. He was not trying to
race the train or anything. It was a horribly tragic accident.''
   The loaded Burlington Northern Railroad train was traveling
about 49 mph in an area where the posted speed for trains is 50
mph, Arganbright said. The crossing, where about 40 trains pass
daily, has no lights or wooden arms to bar traffic when a train is
approaching, he said.
   The accident killed Mark and Vanna Goodpasture, ages 34 and 35,
respectively, their 13-year-old son, Lance, and 9-year-old
daughter, Brook. Another daughter, Brandi, 10, was listed in
critical condition at Good Samaritan Hospital in Kearney.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's term may mark the end of
American industrial strength unless he adopts an economic policy
that provides more assistance to develop new technologies, a
research group said Tuesday.
   Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., chairman of Rebuild America, said the
United States needs an industry-led strategy with government
cooperation and support to compete in the world market.
   ``The next three years represent a critical turning point in
economic history,'' the group said in a report titled, ``Fiddling
While U.S. Industry Burns.''
   ``If President Bush sides with the pragmatists, America can
remain a world-class power for the foreseeable future,'' the report
said. ``If he continues to allow the ideologues to dominate
decision-making, his term may mark the end of American industrial
might.''
   Rebuild America describes itself as a non-profit, bipartisan
research group established to ``promote productive investment in
people and industry.''
   The organization report was critical of Bush's economic advisers
_ Chief of Staff John Sununu, Budget Director Richard Darman and
Economic Adviser Michael Boskin _ for what it called hands-off,
laissez-faire policies toward commercial ventures.
   Those policies, it said, have failed to produce sufficient
commercial research and development, close the investment gap with
Japan, ensure continued U.S. leadership in strategic industries,
protect the U.S. manufacturing base and ``are keeping us the
world's largest debtor and increasingly dependent upon foreigners.''
   The report was written by Lester Thurow, dean of the Sloan
School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
Professor George Lodge of Harvard Business School; Ed Miller,
president of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences, and
Rebuild America director Fred Branfman.
   Thurow, who joined Levine at a news conference, the United
States spends only ``one-half as much per capita on plant and
equipment as the Japanese, two-thirds as much as the Germans'' with
those governments ``footing 50 percent of the research and
development bill.''
   ``We have to spend equivalent amounts,'' he said.
   The administration's three proposals for closing the investment
gap _ reduction of the federal budget deficit, a capital gains tax
cut and its family savings plan _ ``will do little to boost
productive investment in the United States,'' the report contended.
   Unless the administration changes its policies, the report said,
``the U.S. could be a second or third-rate industrial power in the
year 2000, and President Bush will be remembered as the Herbert
Hoover of U.S. industrial competitiveness.''
   Hoover, elected in 1928, was president during the stock market
crash of 1929 and resulting collapse of the economy that led to the
Great Depression.

<TEXT>
   The Senate ethics committee today opened two
weeks of trial-like hearings into the financial dealings of Sen.
Dave Durenberger, warning the Minnesota Republican that he could
face ``strong sanctions.''
   The panel said earlier it found ``substantial credible
evidence'' that the 12-year senator broke Senate rules and federal
law in transactions involving his Minneapolis condominium, a book
promotion deal and free limousine rides.
   Committee Chairman Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., told Durenberger
today the committee had to answer two questions: Whether he
violated Senate rules or laws and whether his conduct had
discredited the Senate.
   Looking straight at Durenberger, Heflin, a former chief justice
of the Alabama Supreme Court, said, ``If the evidence clearly and
convincingly leads me to the conclusion that you have violated the
public trust, I will not hesitate to recommend appropriate
sanctions.''
   In opening its first hearings in nine years on charges that a
senator abused his office, committee members also promised
Durenberger they would not prejudge his case, which the panel has
spent more than a year investigating.
   ``The theory expounded by some that the committee will, because
of the current political climate, take harsh action against Senator
Durenberger in order to prove that it is tough is ludicrous,'' said
committee Vice Chairman Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H..
   ``If the facts warrant, the committee will recommend strong
sanctions. But, if they do not, we will not,'' Rudman said in
opening remarks at the hearing.
   Durenberger sat between his attorney and an aide at a table
facing committee members, his back to around 100 onlookers and
several tables full of reporters.
   The committee's special counsel, Robert Bennett, later opened
his case by saying that Durenberger ``knowingly and actively'' used
a book promotion scheme to circumvent Senate honoraria limits and
divert $100,000 in speaking fees into his own pocket.
   ``This is unethical, this is not honest,'' said Bennett, who was
expected to take most of the day laying out his case.
   One of Durenberger's four sons, Dan, 22, asked his father during
a hearing break, ``How are you?''
   ``Perfect,'' his father replied.
   Bennett is familiar with the role of prosecutor, having brought
the case in 1981 against then-Sen. Harrison A. Williams Jr.,
D-N.J., the last senator to face these kinds of hearings.
   Durenberger spent Monday polishing an opening statement to the
committee to ``give a context'' to the defense by his attorney,
said press secretary Lois West.
   The senator is represented by Jim Hamilton, a former counsel to
the Senate Watergate Committee.
   Durenberger, who has been silent on the case in recent days,
apologized to Minnesotans last December for ``mistakes and lapses
in judgment.''
   But the intense, public scrutiny of his finances could spell the
end of his career if voters in Minnesota, a state known for clean
government, aren't satisfied with his defense.
   Many public radio stations in Minnesota will broadcast the
hearings live and television stations are planning heavy, daily
coverage.
   ``People are concluding that something is seriously wrong,''
said William Luther, the Minneapolis attorney whose complaint
initiated the Senate investigation. ``Now it's a matter of seeing
if any kind of reasonable evidence or defense is presented.''
   Durenberger does not have to run for re-election until 1994, but
opinion polls indicate a majority of Minnesotans think he should
resign if the committee finds serious violations.
   The six-member ethics committee is made up equally of
Republicans and Democrats. It will decide after the hearings
whether its allegations are true and then recommend a punishment to
the full Senate ranging from a mild reprimand to expulsion.
   Bennett recommended removing Williams from the Senate after the
1981 hearings, but he resigned before his colleagues had to vote on
ousting him. The ethics committee began its investigation after
Williams had already been convicted in federal court in the Abscam
bribery case.
   The committee began investigating Durenberger early last year
and brought charges against him in February and again in May.
   The first set of allegations focused on the book contract
Durenberger used to earn $100,000 in speaking fees in 1985 and 1986
for promoting two books he wrote on defense and health issues.
   In May, the panel charged that Durenberger abused his office and
misused public funds in a ``pattern of improper conduct'' involving
his Minneapolis condominium.
   Durenberger has acknowledged that he tried to cut the cost of
maintaining homes in Washington and Minnesota by claiming Senate
reimbursement for nights he stayed in the condominium.

   Columbia was returned to the hangar
Tuesday for repair of a hydrogen leak that has delayed the
shuttle's Astro observatory million until at least August.
   NASA started rolling Columbia off the launch pad before
daybreak. The shuttle completed the 3{-mile trip within six hours.
   Columbia's flight was called off two weeks ago when the leak was
detected during fueling. Officials suspect the leak is in or near a
tight cavity between two metal plates that connect the orbiter and
the external fuel tank.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration planned to
remove the orbiter from the tank on Wednesday.
   It is only the fourth time a shuttle has been transported from

   Atlantis is scheduled to be taken from the hangar to the launch

<TEXT>
   A woman testified today that she tried to help
her husband pull his foot off the accelerator of their speeding
station wagon before it plunged into the Detroit River, drowning
their four children.
   Lawrence DeLisle, 29, is charged with four counts of murder in
the drownings of their children, ages 8 months to 8 years. He is
also standing trial on one count of attempting to murder his wife.
   He faces mandatory life imprisonment without parole if convicted.
   DeLisle has said a leg cramp prevented him from taking his foot
off the accelerator as the car sped down a street and into the
river last Aug. 3. Boaters rescued him and his wife, Suzanne. The
children were trapped.
   Mrs. DeLisle has said her husband is innocent. She was
subpoenaed by the prosecution and agreed to testify.
   Mrs. DeLisle said she managed to pull her husband's foot about
an inch off the accelerator as he struggled to do the same.
   Assistant Wayne County Prosecutor Kevin Simowski asked why she
hadn't mentioned the effort to police or during her husband's
preliminary examination.
   ``I didn't remember it then,'' she replied.
   Mrs. DeLisle, 32, also testified that she escaped the sinking
station wagon through a side window. She was unable to release the
strap holding her infant daughter in a safety seat, and it was too
dark to see the children in the back.
   During the first day of testimony Monday, witnesses said DeLisle
made no attempt to save his children.
   Aaron Stoneburner he was in his boat when he saw the car go into
the water. He helped pull the the DeLisles into his boat.
   ``They embraced, Mr. DeLisle was sobbing, something to the
effect of `Oh my God, what have I done?''' Stoneburner said.
   Prosecutors claim DeLisle deliberately drove into the river in
suburban Wyandotte to rid himself of family and financial burdens.
   ``It wasn't spur-of-the-moment,'' Assistant Prosecutor Kevin
Simowski told the jury in Wayne County Circuit Court. ``Mr. DeLisle
had a lot of options in front of him, and he chose the option to
drown his children.''
   Defense lawyer Frank Eaman mentioned the leg cramp in his
opening arguments and also said the 1977 Ford was defective.
   ``This case is so obviously an accident that you're all going to
wonder why you were here,'' Eaman said.
   Eaman has said DeLisle initially was unemotional because he was
in shock, and didn't dive after the children because he couldn't
swim well.
   Jurors won't hear one piece of evidence _ a purported confession
from DeLisle, given after nine hours of questioning by police.
Judge Robert Colombo Jr. ruled the confession resulted from police
coercion and couldn't be used.

   More than 75,000 gallons of diesel fuel
leaked from a pipeline into the Minnesota River and spread
downstream for about eight miles just south of the Twin Cities,
authorities said today.
   ``It's a major spill as far as I'm concerned,'' said Savage Fire
Chief Al McColl.
   Most of the oil was contained in the downtown Savage area, but
containment devices also were set up near Burnsville, McColl said.
River traffic will be halted until the spill is cleaned up, he said.
   The leak came from a Williams Pipe Line Co. pipe where it
crosses the river in Eden Prairie, McColl said.
   The exact cause of the leak was not immediately known, he said.
A spokesman for Williams did not immediately return a phone call.
   McColl said the leak was noticed around 6:20 a.m. today, but he
did not know how long the pipe had been leaking.
   There were no injuries reported.

<TEXT>
   An FBI agent pleaded guilty today to
manslaughter in the strangulation death of a pregnant woman with
whom he purportedly was having an affair.
   Pike Circuit Judge Bayard Collier sentenced the agent, Mark
Putnam, to 16 years in prison after Putnam accepted a plea bargain
and pleaded guilty to killing Susan Daniels Smith, 28, of Freeburn,
Ky., on June 8, 1989. Sources have said that Ms. Smith met Putnam
when she was serving as an FBI informant.
   The Pike County grand jury indicted Putnam earlier today. The
indictment said Putnam killed the woman ``while under extreme
emotional duress.''
   The FBI has said it has no record of any agent ever being
convicted of killing someone in a similar case.
   Dressed in a starched white shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes,
Putnam said little during the 18-minute proceeding, except to
answer Collier's questions.
   Ms. Smith's family on Monday bitterly denounced the pending plea
agreement and asked the grand jury to indict him for murder.
   Shelby Ward, Ms. Smith's sister, and several sources say Putnam
admitted killing Ms. Smith during an argument over support payments
for the woman's expected child.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, and Ms.
Smith's family say the agent described the killing and location of
the woman's body in exchange for a plea bargain. The remains were
found only last week.
   Mrs. Ward and her brother, Billy Joe Daniels, said
Commonwealth's Attorney John Paul Runyon did not consult the family
about the plea bargain.
   ``Because he was a big FBI, famous and everything, they don't
want him to get justice,'' Mrs. Ward said after meeting with the
grand jury. ``I'd still like to have a murder trial. ... I don't
care what that clique there says. To me it was a brutal murder.
Brutal, brutal.''
   Runyon declined to respond, saying only: ``I can't control what
she says.''
   Ms. Smith's family has retained Pikeville lawyer Larry Webster
to file a lawsuit against the agent and possibly the FBI. Webster
said he intends to file the suit today, seeking ``millions'' in
damages and lost earnings.
   ``If she was working for them at the time and she lost her life,
she could be entitled to get paid for that,'' Webster said.

   Explosions felt up to 30 miles away
leveled a small fireworks plant today, killing two people,
authorities said.
   An hour after the first explosion at 9 a.m., witnesses said
there were still minor explosions at the Mid-South Fireworks plant,
located six miles southeast of this east-central Mississippi town.
   ``We have not found the bodies yet, but we are sure there are
two,'' Don Harris of the Lowndes County medical examiner's office
said at late morning. ``We have just now been able to put water to
it.''
   He said two people were injured. Suzy Powers, a spokesman for
the Golden Triangle Regional Medical Center in Columbus, said one
person had been brought in ``with fairly minor injuries.''
   The plant usually employees about 20, but that increases to
about 35 this time of the year. But at the time of the explosion,
only four people were believed to be in the plant, witnesses said.
   The old brick school that housed the plant ``is down to the
ground,'' Harris said.
   ``There was one small explosion, then a real big one,'' said Ed
Markham of Ekanobel Inc., a chemical plant about four miles from
the fireworks factory. ``After the first one, I thought it was a
sonic boom from a plane. Then the second one went off and I knew it
was something big.''
   Markham said he understood a trailer containing more explosives
survived the initial blasts and that officials were trying to move
it to a safe area away from the plant.
   The blasts were felt as far away at Mississippi State University
about 30 miles away in Starkville.
   ``We felt two distinct booms and the windows on the east side of
our building, which is located in the center of campus, were
rattled,'' said Sammy McDavid, a university spokesman. ``It did no
damage here. It was one of those things that you say, `What was
that?''

<HEAD>Committee Hears Testimony on Credit Privacy Laws</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers' privacy rights are not violated
when businesses share their credit records, banking and retail
officials said Tuesday in opposing legislation to restrict the
practice.
   In fact, consumers benefit from quick availability of credit and
direct-mail sales they otherwise might not hear about, William
Bloom of the National Retail Federation told a House subcommittee
that is considering revisions to the 20-year-old Fair Credit
Reporting Act.
   But other witnesses told the panel the law should be changed so
that consumers, not private credit reporting agencies, control
access to their credit records.
   ``Credit records are more than just account numbers. They are a
consumer's reputation,'' Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., told the
House Banking Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs.
   ``Since credit bureaus make huge profits by finding new ways to
sell personal credit records, they have shown no interest in
seriously protecting a consumer's privacy,'' Rinaldo said.
   The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Richard Lehman, D-Calif.,
proposes allowing credit reporting bureaus to release customer
records to solicitors and other companies only if the consumers
have a chance to bar such action.
   Rinaldo would go further. His proposal would allow credit
reports to be provided only for transactions initiated by consumers
_ not for such things as direct-mail marketing or pre-approved
lines of credit.
   In a third proposal, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., would allow
credit files to be released only with consumers' consent, and only
to companies seeking new customers by offering them credit.
   Bloom, vice president of Saks Fifth Avenue, defended the sharing
of customers' credit records through credit reporting bureaus.
   The practice ``is innocent in its operation and the benefits to
both creditors and consumers are real,'' Bloom said. Consumers get
quicker credit, and direct mailings help new businesses enter a
local marketplace, he said.
   A proposal to allow the Federal Trade Commission to impose civil
penalties against those who misuse credit records should be dropped
because enough penalties already exist, contended Alan Heuer of
Marine Midland Bank, representing the Consumer Bankers Association
and the American Bankers Association.
   Jean Noonan, associate director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that although
there is a danger that use of credit reports can be an invasion of
privacy, her office would rather regulate it than ban it.
   And Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., ranking minority member of the
subcommittee, said the proposals to restrict the credit reporting
law go too far.
   ``We also have to be concerned that we do not shut off the flow
of credit to all but the most gold-plated credit risks,'' Hiler
said.
   Bonnie Guiton, director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs,
said, ``Most consumers are concerned about how much information is
known about them'' by private business. She noted that industry
estimates the error rate in credit records could be as high as 40
percent.
   But she opposed proposals to require credit reporting companies
to provide customers a free annual copy of their credit record. The
consumers will end up paying the cost, she said, adding that credit
companies instead should have to conduct random checks on their own
work and publish the results.
   The various proposals include language to give consumers new
power to correct errors in their credit reports, and require that
they be notified when their credit report is used to deny them a
transaction.

<HEAD>Japan Says It's Willing to Resume Loans to Peru</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan said Tuesday it is willing to resume loans to
Peru if the South American nation's new government shows
willingness to deal with its serious economic and social problems.
   The Japanese ancestry of Peru's new president, Alberto Fujimori,
has raised hopes of greater access to Japanese aid. Fujimori said
Monday he hoped to visit Tokyo before his scheduled July 28
inauguration.
   Fujimori's victory over Mario Vargas Llosa in Peru's
presidential runoff election Sunday was the top story in many
Japanese newspapers. Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe
extended the government's ``heartfelt congratulations'' to Fujimori.
   He noted that Fujimori would be the first ethnic Japanese to
head a foreign government.
   ``But at the same time, the diplomacy and the relations between
the two countries should not be swayed by such factors,'' Watanabe
said.
   Peru was the largest recipient of Japanese aid in Latin America
in cumulative terms until 1988, but dropped to fourth-largest after
it defaulted on payments and Japan cut off its yen credits.
   Fujimori faces widespread unemployment, a 2,000 percent
inflation rate, terrorism and extensive drug trafficking.
   Despite Peru's previous default, ``if there is a willingness to
cope and overcome those problems and explain to us in concrete
manner what means they will take, and if we are satisfied, yes,
there is always a possibility of more loans,'' Watanabe told a news
briefing.
   Peru reportedly estimates its current worldwide medium- and
long-term debt, both public and private, at about $15.2 billion.
   One Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, estimated Peru owes Japan $1 billion in government and
private debts.
   The ministry said Japanese government credits to Peru have
totaled $359 million since 1971. The last outlay was in 1983, $31.3
million for fishing port construction, it said.
   Watanabe said the Japanese government is aware of reports that
Fujimori wants to visit Japan, but had not received any official
notification. If Fujimori indicates he wants to visit, ``we would
welcome him and would like to arrange meetings with those people he
wants to meet,'' he said.
   Fujimori, 51, is the eldest son of Japanese emigrants who
traveled to Peru from Japan's southern island of Kyushu in 1934. In
Lima, they opened an upholstery shop that failed during a boycott
of Japanese businesses during World War II.
   Fujimori earned a degree in agricultural engineering and became
a school administrator.
   Japanese emigration peaked in the decades before and after World
War II, but has always been relatively small. Japanese settlers
never have exceeded 1 percent of the population of their host
countries.
   Brazil was the principal destination of Japanese settlers in
North and South America in the prewar years, followed by the United
States, Canada and Peru.
   In recent years, Japan's prosperity and stability have
discouraged further emigration. Last year, only 3,851 Japanese
settled in other countries, the Foreign Ministry says.

<HEAD>Native Groups Worried About Court Adoption Rulings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ENDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eskimo and Indian groups as well as
Alaska officials say two recent court decisions undermine a federal
law meant to guarantee tribal rights in adoption cases.
   The Alaska Supreme Court in December and a Southern California
Superior Court judge in February ruled that tribes have no right to
intervene in adoption proceedings involving Eskimo or Indian
children if the mother gives up the child voluntarily.
   Representatives of Indian and Eskimo rights groups in Alaska and
the Lower 48 have criticized the rulings, saying they violate the
intent of the Indian Child Welfare Act.
   ``Essentially, the Alaska Supreme Court has sanctioned a
loophole'' in the federal law, said Lloyd Miller, a lawyer for the
Anchorage-based Cook Inlet Tribal Council.
   The tribal council earlier this year appealed the state Supreme
Court's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the panel declined
to hear the appeal.
   The Indian Child Welfare Act was enacted by Congress in 1978
after it reviewed evidence that up to 50 percent of some tribes'
children nationally had been put up for adoption.
   Congress agreed with Indian advocates that adoption of Indian
children by non-Indian parents was threatening the integrity of
tribal groups and that such adoptions can cause long-term soct Tribal Council,
wasn't notified. The mother later changed her
mind and sought the council's assistance to recover her child.
   ``If the birth parent asks to remain anonymous, in other words,
chooses not to have the tribe notified, we believe the mother's
right to privacy supersedes the tribe's right to be notified,''
said Jim Caldarola, executive director of Catholic Social Services,
the state's largest private adoption agency.
   But Indian groups contend the Indian Child Welfare Act was meant
to protect the child's rights, not the mother's.
   The second case involves an Aleut girl from the Kodiak Island
village of Akhiok. Her 19-year-old mother from Cypress, Calif.,
decided to give up her child to a non-Aleut couple in Canada, but
Akhiok village leaders learned of the case and want the child back.
   ``We're trying to get the baby out of Canada and back down here
to our community,'' said Akhiok Tribal Council President David
Eluska. ``Too many of our tribal members in the past have been
adopted out and we have no idea or inkling where they ended up.''
   State, tribal officials and Indian advocates believe that when
children are not adopted by their own people, they are removed from
their ancestral heritage and thrust into a sort of cultural and
ethnic limbo.
   From 1985 through 1987, the last year for which statistics are
available, 474 Eskimo and Indian children were adopted, according
to the Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics. Ninety-two were adopted
by couples who were neither Eskimo nor Indian.
   State officials agree the notification issue creates a loophole
in federal law.
   ``The state's position is that the notice should be required,''
said Myra Munson, commissioner of the state Department of Health
and Social Services. ``We believe it (the federal law) should be
amended.''
   Indian advocates have said the court cases are important, not
just to Alaska but to the entire country.
   ``It's of a great deal of importance nationally,'' said Jack
Trope, a lawyer with the New York-based Association of American
Indian Affairs, a non-profit legal aid and advocacy group concerned
about Indian issues.
   ``Up until very recently the tribes were certain under the act
that they had the right to intervene,'' Trope said.
   The recent case ``indicated that the right to intervention is
not as clear cut in the act as everyone thought. That's of great
concern.''
   Trope predicts legal battles across the country to clarify the
law.
   ``We'll certainly be looking to fight these things in the court
system,'' he said. ``The law is on our side, notwithstanding what
the Alaska Supreme Court says.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fast food restaurant chain is voluntarily
recalling 300,000 sports water bottles because the mouthpiece can
present a choking hazard to children.
   Taco Bell Corp. of Irvine, Calif., began last Monday offering
the bottles for 99 cents to customers who made food purchases at
its 2,700 stores nationwide. But the promotional campaign was
suspended three days laer after the company ``received a report
from a customer that his 21-month-old child had dismantled the
bottle's mouthpiece and attempted to swallow it,'' the Consumer
Product Safety Commission said.
   When a CPSC inspector tried to purchase a bottle last Friday he
was told store managers had been instructed to pack them up and
ship them back the day before, the agency said in a written
statement.
   ``It's the fastest work on a recall I've ever seen,'' said CPSC
spokesman Dan Rumelt.
   Consumers should return the bottles to the Taco Bell where
purchased for a full refund.
   More than 20 million of the water bottles, which have become a
popular fixture among sports enthusiasts, have been marketed in the
last ten years by Specialized Bicycle Components of Morganhill,
Calif., according to company president Mike Sinyard.
   Specialized has redesigned the bottles and plans to ship them to
customers like Taco Bell by June 25, he said.
   The company also will replace mouthpieces on all other bottles
it distributed. Consumers should contact Specialized at
1-800-735-4668.

   The Coast Guard also backed away from earlier reports that the
886-foot tanker had begun buckling because of the intense heat, the
shifting cargo and the contiuous stream of water being poured on
the vessel.
   ``There is no evidence at all of any structural damage,'' said
Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Gene Maestas.
   He said crews on the scene 57 miles southeast of Galveston
reported no signs of damage.
   The Norwegian tanker was transferring some of its cargo of 38
million gallons of oil to a smaller tanker when the first
explosions occurred. Two of the 41 crew members were killed and two
are missing and presumed dead.
   On Monday, the Coast Guard said there was a slightly increased
chance the ship would sink because waves were washing over the back
end.
   The Coast Guard said today they believed less than 2,000 gallons
of light crude remained in the water. The rest of the up to 100,000
gallons believed spilled since Saturday had either dissipated or
burned off, officials said.
   As a precaution, the U.S. government asked Mexico to send oil
skimmers to help with cleanup operations if the situation worsens.
``We're in the planning stages for what may be a catastrophic
incident,'' said Maestas.
   The rear of the Mega Borg has dropped more than 60 feet since
the Norwegian tanker was crippled early Saturday by explosions and
fire. The drop indicated either that the cargo had shifted or the
ship was taking on water, officials said.
   The dropping stern ``increases the danger of sinking but only
incrementally,'' Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Todd Nelson said.
``We are not talking right now about sinking.''
   Rear Adm. William Kime, commandant of the Coast Guard, flew over
the crippled ship and said that despite the setbacks, ``We're
cautiously optimistic.''
   However, Bob Schuller, a naval architect in Houston, said the
dropping added pressure on the ship's structure. He said he did not
know the extent of damage but speculated the pressure could crack
the ship or sink it.
   The Mega Borg carries more than three times as much oil as was
spilled by the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in March 1989 in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Authorities, however, noted the oil spilled in Alaska was heavy
crude, which doesn't dissipate nearly as rapidly as the light crude
aboard the Mega Borg. Also, much of the oil spilling off Texas was
being consumed by fire.
   Currents and winds were expected to push the oil toward a
200-mile stretch of coast between Freeport and Corpus Christi. But
the Coast Guard said the currents were expected to keep the spill
from coming ashore.
   Gary Clark, Houston Audubon Society president, said the coast is
``probably the most sensitive breeding bird area in the United
States'' and that a huge spill would come at the worst time _ the
height of the breeding season for many birds.
   The tanker, operated by Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway,
was bound from Palanca, Angola. It was scheduled to travel to Aruba
after Galveston.
   ELF, a Houston-based oil distributor that was going to market
the tanker's cargo, is paying an undetermined amount for the
cleanup.
   Texas officials, meanwhile, urged lawmakers to better prepare
the big oil-producing state for spills by unifying the state's
approach to prevention and planning.
   ``The focus has not been there. There hasn't been any concerted
effort to put such a contingency plan together,'' said Andy Mangan,
the state's deputy land commissioner.

<TEXT>
   Australia's ambassador circled his embassy in
a sporty red convertible Tuesday to introduce the first
Australian-built car line to be exported to the United States.
   Australia hopes to export more than $300 million worth of the
newly designed Mercury Capri convertibles for sale by U.S.
Lincoln-Mercury dealers, said Ambassador Michael Cook, who held a
news conference with Ford Motor Co. officials on the embassy's
front walk.
   In the mid-1960s, Australia's car exports exceeded those of
Japan, Cook said. But Japan has surged way ahead of Australia,
which has never before exported cars to the United States.
   The Capri is a front-wheel drive convertible with a small,
two-place seat in the rear. It is expected to compete with the
fast-selling, Japanese-made Mazda Miata.
   Ford is partners with Mazda, which helped developed the Capri
chassis and power train.
   The base price of the Capri is $12,500, with an airconditioned
XR2 model selling for $15,900. The only major option is a removable
hard top for about $1,200.
   About 30,000 1991 Capri are to be brought to the United States
with another 10,000 built with the driver's seat on the right side
for sale in Australia, Ford spokesman Bill Gray said. The first
shipment of 25 is to arrive for the District of Columbia's July 4
parade.
   Joe Chavara, Lincoln-Mercury district sales manager, said Ford
expects more than half the buyers of the basic model to be women.
   The Capri model name has not been used by Ford for several
years. The original Capri were built in Germany and later in the
United States.
   Ford officials said the new Capri body was designed in Italy and
the car uses some Japanese mechanical parts but it was manufactured
and assembled at a $250 million Ford plant near Melbourne.

   Three members of a Japanese climbing
team were airlifted off a 14,000-foot level of Mount McKinley
following the death of one of the team's climbers.
   National Park Service officials said the three climbers, two
with frostbite on their toes, were airlifted Monday evening and
were to be taken to a hospital in Anchorage.
   Rescuers believe they just 500 feet below Hairoaki Ito, 38, when
he died Sunday. He was the first person to die on McKinley this
year.
   Officials said the party of seven Japanese climbers left much of
their survival gear at about 17,000 feet early Saturday in an
effort to make a quick ascent of the 20,320-feet summit.
   ``It's not uncommon to do that, although it's risky,'' said park
service spokesman John Quinley. ``Their gear was a long way from
where they were.''
   After ascending a couple thousand feet more up the mountain's
West Rib, Ito became too sick to continue and stayed behind while
his companions went on and apparently made it to the top, Quinley
said.
   The six other climbers became separated on the way down, two
making a safe descent with another party down the West Buttress and
four returning to Ito.
   The strongest remained with Ito, while the three others went for
help, Quinley said.

<TEXT>
   Drug czar William Bennett said the ``Great
Deceiver'' is partly responsible for U.S. drug problems, and
applauded the nation's largest Protestant denomination to bring
drug abusers to God.
   In a speech filled with religious imagery, Bennett, a Roman
Catholic, told a group of Southern Baptists that the drug problem
``is, in the end, fundamentally a moral problem. It is
fundamentally a spiritual problem.''
   He said crack users are searching for meaning in their lives,
and some refer to the drug as the devil, or ``the big lie.''
   Without referring specifically to the devil, Bennett said when
looking at the drug crisis, ``One can speak of the Great Deceiver,
the Great Deceiver everyone knows.''
   At a luncheon Monday before their annual meeting, Bennett also
told the group of Southern Baptists, ``I applaud your effort to
bring those in need to the God who heals.''
   The former education secretary said Americans need to have the
``courage'' to teach values in public schools.
   ``There is no earthly reason or divine reason public schools
cannot talk about values,'' Bennett told reporters later. ``If you
have a drug education program that is value-neutral, you have a
valueless drug education program.''
   He said America needs to bring the wisdom of the Judeo-Christian
tradition to bear on the drug problem.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev met the presidents of all
three Baltic republics today, the first time since the Soviet
president called their steps toward independence illegal.
   The leaders held ``an exchange of opinions on the situation in
inter-ethnic relations,'' reported Vremya, the government's nightly
TV news, without giving further details.
   Vremya's reference to ethnic relations apparently referred to
reports that the independence moves in the Baltic republics have
heightened tensions between Russian-speaking residents and the
native populations.
   The meeting appeared to mark a new stage in the diplomatic
effort to end the impasse that began when Lithuania declared
independence in March. Latvia and Estonia followed with resolutions
setting transition periods to independence.
   Before the meeting, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
sounded upbeat about seeing Gorbachev.
   ``Constructive dialogue is on the way,'' Landsbergis said upon
arrival at the Lithuanian mission in Moscow. He earlier held a
40-minute meeting with Presidents Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia and
Arnold Ruutel of Estonia at the Latvian mission.
   Gorbachev, in a report to the Supreme Soviet parliament on his
Washington summit, did not mention today's meeting.
   He acknowledged that some Americans oppose Senate ratification
of a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement signed during the summit ``until
Moscow grants independence to the group of Lithuanian separatists.''
   ``But after I had contacts with the American people, it turned
out that such demands do not reflect the position of the entire
United States,'' Gorbachev told parliament.
   Gorbachev also held a meeting with the presidents of all 15
Soviet republics, and told them it was time to get down to
practical work on revamping the Soviet federation, Vremya reported.
   The meeting included the Baltic presidents and Boris N. Yeltsin,
president of the Russian republic, which deepened Gorbachev's
problems today by passing a declaration of sovereignty, although a
non-binding one.
   During his parliamentary address, Gorbachev did not mention that
President Bush said he would not implement the trade deal until the
Soviet parliament gives final endorsement to a law liberalizing
Soviet emigration policies.
   Although Soviet Jews and other ethnic groups are leaving in
record numbers, parliament last week adopted an agenda that delays
until at least September final consideration of the law, which it
has given preliminary approval.
   Reports from Washington inddents formed a united front last month to
press their drives to restore the independence they lost 50 years
ago when forcibly annexed. The leaders had asked for a meeting with
Gorbachev.
   Estonia and Latvia have taken a more cautious path than
Lithuania, tentatively declaring independence but setting no date
for their secession.
   Gorbachev embargoed all oil, most natural gas and other raw
materials shipments to Lithuania on April 18 to press the republic
to rescind pro-independence laws. Lithuania has said since then
that it is willing to negotiate on rolling back those laws but
steadfastly refuses to revoke its declaration of independence.

   A black businessman endorsed by his party's leadership competed
against a Ku Klux Klan supporter Tuesday in an Arkansas runoff for
the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor.
   Ralph Forbes, a former member of the American Nazi Party who
advocates separate governments for blacks and whites, faced Kenneth
``Muskie'' Harris, an executive with a Little Rock company. Either
man figured to be an underdog in November against the Democratic
nominee, ex-Rep. Jim Guy Tucker.
   In South Carolina, Democratic state Sens. Ernest Passailaigue,
serving his first term, and Theo Mitchell, a 16-year veteran of the
Legislature, vied for the nomination to challenge popular GOP Gov.
Carroll Campbell. Mitchell would be the state's first black
governor.
   Both parties held primaries in Maine for the seat of Democratic
Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, who is trying to regain his old job of
governor. State Attorney General James E. Tierney was favored in a
five-way Democratic race. Republicans chose between state Rep. John
McCormick, an opponent of abortion rights, and David F. Emery, a
former congressman who has changed his position and is now
pro-choice.
   In Atlantic City, N.J., Mayor James L. Usry, under indictment on
charges of political corruption, was in a non-partisan runoff with
City Councilman Jim Whelan. Usry was the city's first black mayor.
   North Dakota voters decided whether to raise sales taxes from 5
percent to 6 percent for a year to improve education.
   They also voted for the non-partisan post of labor commissioner.
Incumbent Byron Knutson, accused of sloppy management, was
challenged by S.F. ``Buckshot'' Hoffner, head of the state
Centennial Commission, and Craig Hagen, a political newcomer who
won't reach the minimum age for the office of 25 until after the
primary.
   In two counties west of Bismarck, an advisory vote was held to
determine whether residents want to switch from Mountain to Central
time to conform to the capital city.

   Forbes, 50-year-old evangelist for the Sword of the Lord Good
News Ministries, polled 46 percent of the 71,000 votes cast in a
three-way May 29 primary, short of the majority needed to win the
nomination. Harris, 36, placed second with 36 percent.
   The contest attracted little attention before the primary,
partly because Republicans were preoccupied with an unusually
bitter race for the gubernatorial nomination. The winner of that
primary, businessman Sheffield Nelson, promptly repudiated Forbes
and endorsed Harris, as did virtually all the state's GOP leaders.
   In an interview Sunday with the Arkansas Democrat, Forbes
proclaimed that ``white Christian Americans are the true lost tribe
of Israel'' and said that the sight of an interracial couple
``turns my stomach.''
   Forbes has run unsuccessfully for several statewide offices,
including a 1986 bid for the GOP lieutenant governor's nomination.
He also managed the 1988 presidential campaign of former Klan
leader David Duke, who is now a state representative in Louisiana.
   Harris is a property-management executive with JM Products Inc.,
a Little Rock company that manufactures hair care products for
blacks. He has lost bids for seats in the General Assembly and the
Little Rock Board of Directors.
   In South Carolina, Passailaigue, a 42-year-old accountant from
Charleston, has frequently challenged the Senate leadership in his
freshman term and made an unsuccessful push for tax reform.
   Mitchell, a 51-year-old Greenville lawyer and a lawmaker since
1974, has been a proponent of public transportation and assistance
to the poor.
   In Atlantic City, Usry, a 68-year-old former school
administrator, pleaded innocent in January to charges of illegally
accepting $6,000 while hospitalized last summer. He said he was
targeted for investigation because he is black.
   Whelan, 41, did not raise the issue of the indictment but
blasted Usry for saying the night of the May 8 election that he
would not campaign in two predominantly white wards.
   North Dakota's tax measure was designed to raise $42 million
over a year to restore education cuts made after voters rejected
new taxes last year.
   The time zone votes in Oliver and Mercer counties were not
binding, but favorable votes could prompt county commissioners to
petition the federal Department of Transportation make the change.
   Three GOP senators faced no primary opposition Tuesday in their
bids for re-election. Sen. John W. Warner of Virginia won't even
face a major party opponent in November. Sen. William S. Cohen of
Maine will face Democratic state Rep. Neil Rolde in November, and
Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina will be challenged by
Democrat Robert Cunningham.

   reform for years to come.
   He said it was a mistake to focus almost exclusively on present
teachers.
   ``Both older and younger teachers have to be considered, but if
I were to draw a conclusion, I'd say we have been far too
neglectful of educating the new generation of teachers who will be
determining where schools will be going in the first quarter of the
21st century,'' said Boyer in a recent interview.
   Darling-Hammond added it's generally easier to train a new
teacher in reform techniques such as team teaching than it is to
persuade a veteran teacher to break long-cherished classroom habits.
   Some teacher colleges have begun to address these problems. The
``Holmes Group,'' a coalition of about 100 education schools
interested in reform, is fostering programs allowing student
teachers to practice new techniques in public school classrooms.
Several such programs have started recently in Michigan, for
example.
   The rise in the average age of teachers during the last two
decades mirrors declining student enrollments and tight state
school budgets. Those trends have been most pronounced in the
Midwest and Northeast.
   Not all states keep teacher age data. But a check of state
departments of education and local union affiliates found the
average age of teachers in Connecticut, for example, is 43.3; in
Georgia, 42; Indiana, 42; Michigan, 44; Maryland, 41.1; and New
Jersey, 42.5.
   The median age in New York was 42.4 as the 1988-89 school year,
and 25.1 percent of the teaching force is 49 or older.
   In Massachusetts, suffering the effects of a decade-old tax
revolt measure and a worsening budget crisis, the average age is 47.
   By contrast, teachers in New Mexico, a Sunbelt state with a
growing student population, average 37.7.
   Reformers concerned over average age emphasize they don't mean
to belittle the skills of veteran teachers.
   ``More experienced teachers are more productive. They just won't
make the mistakes a younger teacher would,'' said Gould.
   Nonetheless, the age statistics lend urgency to the need to
update the skills of veteran teachers and create more collegial
environments in public schools, said Darling-Hammond.
   ``By and large, teacher effectiveness increases during the first
five to seven years of a career, then levels off and may even
decline. Whether that happens depends on the school environment.
Collegial environments that have lots of opportunities to develop
and learn help foster professional growth. But that's not
typical,'' she said.
   Educators believe that school improvement is most likely to take
root in schools with a balanced mix of young and old teachers.
   ``From what I see, whether or not a person is willing to take a
look at innovative ideas has little to do with age,'' said Keith
Geiger, president of the National Education Association. ``I hear
as many innovative ideas from 50 year-olds as 25 year-olds.''
   But statistics suggest that the balance has swung toward a
heavier concentration of veteran teachers, many of whom have seen
reform waves come and go with little apparent effect and may be
viewing current reform efforts skeptically.
   ``I think all teachers want to be part of exciting changes,''
Boyer said. ``But we have to ask: Which teachers will be prepared
to harness technology? Will they be prepared to deal with an
increasingly bilingual population? Will they be prepared to be
creative and not just conforming?''

<TEXT>
   A state Senate committee Tuesday
approved legislation reducing to $25 the maximum penalty for
beating someone burning an American flag.
   The panel's 3-2 vote came the day after the U.S. Supreme Court
overturned the federal flag protection act. The bill was approved
by the state House in a 53-39 Memorial Day vote. The full Senate
gets the bill next.
   Rep. James David Cain said his bill was needed to demonstrate
the people's desire for a constitutional amendment protecting the
flag.
   ``The whole point of the bill is to send Washington a message to
do something now,'' Cain told the committee.
   Cain's bill would amend state laws on simple battery. The crime
now carries a maximum $500 fine and six months in jail. The change
would specify that a person who commits simple battery on a flag
burner would face no jail time and a maximum $25 fine.

<HEAD>Former Rulers in Central Europe Show Good Staying Power</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist parties in Eastern
Europe have shown surprising staying power in the region's first
free elections in four decades.
   In Bulgaria and Romania, former Communists won elections.
   In Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia, the
Communist ideologoy has been largely dismissed by voters and
replaced by reformers.
   But even in Czechoslovakia, where over the weekend President
Vaclav Havel's Civic Forum was the big winner, Communists
demonstrated a surprising core of power.
   ``I did underestimate the Communists, I would give them
something like 8 percent of the vote,'' said Jan Urban, leader of
Civic Forum, who watched the Communists get 13.7 percent of the
vote.
   After the swift fall of a series of Communist governments in
Central Europe last year, the Communist successes in free elections
were not widely expected.
   In Czechoslovakia, many attributed the Communist vote to the
country's relatively high standard of living in the East bloc and a
long leftist tradition. But another reason seemed to be a fear of
persecution on the part of many who were members of the old regime.
   ``I am convinced that the (anti-Communist) campaign ... and the
demands to ban the Communist Party contributed to the fact that
people who are still Communist Party members or ho recently left
the party were afraid,'' said Petr Uhl, veteran dissident and Civic
Forum member.
   ``They feared for their existence and their future and that
brought them together,'' Uhl said. But he added that in spite of
their limited success it was ``a party of the past.''
   In East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, Communists
are virtually excluded from the new governments and expect to act
as a parliamentary opposition.
   In Romania, reform Communists instrumental in the ouster of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu defeated a badly organized opposition
led by figures who had been in exile for years. Bulgaria, probably
the Soviet Union's closest ally in the East bloc, also voted in a
government of reform Communists.
   Communists in all the countries may profit from the hardships
during the region's transition to a market economy.
   ``This is the end of the euphoria of slogans, the time when
according to some it was enough to bad-mouth the Communists,'' said
Ladislav Adamec, Czechoslovakia's Communist leader.
   He expressed hope that things could swing the Communists' way
again.
   ``It is probable that a new regrouping of political forces will
take place, and that means new opportunities for us,'' he said.
   But the problems of his party are great. About 700,000 members
have left the Communist Party since December 1989, mostly younger
people who joined after 1981. That leaves a high percentage of
older, more orthodox, members whose political future seems limited.
   Communists will not be permitted to join the new coalition
government and the aging party membership seems unlikely to produce
dynamic parliamentary politicians.
   The Czechoslovak Communist Party relinquished power under the
pressure of a revolution. In contrast, the Polish and Hungarian
parties were in the vanguard of reform, pushing their countries
toward a more liberal system.
   Many people recognize that Imre Pozsgay, a leading reformer in
the Hungarian Communist Party, played an important role in
dismantling the one-party system in that nation.
   Yet despite the party's pioneering role in East European reform,
it only won just over 10 percent of the vote in elections held in
March and April.
   The Polish Communist Party tried to distance itself from its
past by adopting the name Social Democracy of the Republic of
Poland. Nonetheless, as local elections in the country showed
recently, the Solidarity labor movement has virtually wiped out the
former Communists as a political force.
   There are still several former Communist ministers in the
Cabinet, however, under last August's agreement between Solidarity
and the Communists.

<HEAD>Outdoor Condom Campaign Launched in San Francisco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NOEL K. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxis, bus shelters, even the city's famed
cable cars are displaying advertisements for name-brand condoms as
part of a bold move to expand condom advertising.
   Schmid Laboratories, the world's largest condom manufacturer,
took the step because ``while the awareness of the AIDS problem is
very high, behavior changes are not as great as anyone would like
to have it,'' company President Don Falk said Monday.
   City officials agreed the time has come for condom advertising.
   Unlike previous ad campaigns for condoms that took a public
service approach, the new outdoor campaign tries to reach a broader
audience by encouraging general condom use.
   The ads, which began appearing on 75 taxis, 10 cable cars and 23
bus shelters on Monday, show a box of condoms on a white
background. Black lettering on the ads say:
   ``For extra protection _ Ramses condoms.''
   The company coordinating the bus shelter campaign also supports
the ads. The ads look good and there ``was never any question'' of
not putting them up, said Lou Lillian, vice president-general
manager of Gannett outdoor advertising.
   The AIDS epidemic shifted the focus of condom advertising from
contraception to AIDS prevention, Falk said, but now the campaign
strategy is shifting back somewhat.
   Falk conceded that the AIDS crisis opened doors for condom
manufacturers by expanding the market and increasing the public's
tolerance for open peddling of the product.
   Recent advertising stunts have included flying a plane over Fort
Lauderdale Beach, Fla., and Padre Island in Texas during spring
break with a banner that read ``Play safe with Ramses Extra.'' A
similar tactic was used at the Indianapolis 500.
   The San Francisco project will last two months. Schmid will
evaluate the campaign's effectiveness by tracking sales and
conducting surveys.
   Coordinating the project's release with the upcoming sixth
International Conference on AIDS was aimed at reaching a receptive
audience. ``We thought the timing would be perfect,'' Falk said.
``The campaign would reach not only people in San Francisco who
would be interested in condoms, but 10,000 to 12,000 people from
all over the world who would be interested.
   ``I fully expect that if the project is a success we would
repeat and expand it.''

<HEAD>Foreign Trade Deficit Smallest in 6 Years</HEAD>

   The deficit in the broadest measure of U.S.
trade shrank to a six-year low of $22.94 billion during the first
three months of the year, the government reported Tuesday, but
analysts cautioned that the good news may be temporary.
   The Commerce Department credited a record level of American
merchandise exports, increased spending by foreign tourists and
higher U.S. investment earnings for the 14 percent improvement in
the current account deficit compared to the fourth quarter, when
the deficit had been $26.69 billion.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most closely watched trade statistic because it measures not
only trade in merchandise but also trade in services and investment
flows between countries.
   The first quarter deficit was the smallest since a $20.5 billion
gap in the first three months of 1984. But analysts cautioned that
special factors had skewed the new figure and that the U.S. trade
performance is likely to deteriorate in coming months.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI-McGraw Hill, said
that $3 billion in first quarter export growth came from backlogged
shipments at Boeing Co., which had curtailed shipments during a
strike late last year. He predicted the overall deficit for all of
1990 would total $108 billion, essentially unchanged from the
$110.03 billion for 1989.
   ``The first quarter was a bit of a false dawn,'' Wyss said.
   Even with the quarter's improvement, the United States is
beginning the 1990s in a far different position from the beginning
of the 1980s. A decade ago, America was the largest creditor
nation. It ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on
overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
in payments for imported cars and televisions, the investment
cushion eroded. It disappeared altogether in 1985, when the United
States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   That means foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans
own overseas, a development that has led some to say the United
States is losing control over its economic destiny.
   Tuesday's report indicates America's debtor position has now
risen to around $670 billion, although the government's official
accounting of the gap between U.S. holdings and foreign investments
will not be released for several more weeks.
   Brad Larschan, an attorney with the Association for
International Investment, a lobbying group for foreign companies
doing business in the United States, said there was a growing push
in Congress to restrict foreign investment, which he termed an
``unfortunate development'' given America's continued need to
finance the shortfall in its current account position with foreign
borrowing.
   For the first three months of the year, the merchandise trade
deficit narrowed by 8.2 percent to $26.37 billion as an all-time
high in U.S. export sales offset the highest volume of oil imports
in more than 12 years.
   The surplus in the investment category rose by 8.3 percent to
$608 million while the surplus in the services category, which
covers such things as foreign tourist spending in the United States
and banking and insurance earnings by U.S. companies operating
overseas, rose 3.1 percent to $6.31 billion.
   The fourth category in the current account, unilateral
transfers, covers U.S. foreign aid payments and pension benefits
paid to Americans living overseas. It shrank by 25 percent to $3.49
billion in the first quarter.

   President Bush's backers predicted a close
victory Tuesday in the Senate fight to protect his unblemished veto
record and deny federal support for Amtrak.
   ``We have a good chance of winning,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole said before the veto override battle. ``Everything's on
track.''
   ``It will be close, but we're hopeful,'' White House spokeswoman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Tuesday's vote pitted $2 billion in federal support for the
national passenger rail system against Bush's record of having none
of his 11 vetoes overridden by Congress.
   The House voted 294-123 on June 7 to override Bush's veto of the
bill, which authorized payment of the subsidy over three years. It
was the first time either chamber had gathered the votes necessary
for an override. A two-thirds vote is necessary in both houses to
override a presidential veto.
   In the House vote, 58 Republicans joined in the override. The
Senate has a 55-45 Democratic majority.
   Bush vetoed the bill May 24, complaining about a provision in
the bill unrelated to Amtrak.
   He took issue with a requirement that the Interstate Commerce
Commission approve any acquisition of railroads by non-railroad
companies. Bush called it ``an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to
the financial restructuring of the railroad industry.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., urged a Senate
subcommittee Tuesday to stop the National Park Service from a land
deal that would allow commercial development of pristine, Southern
California land owned by comedian Bob Hope.
   Under the arrangement, Hope would give the National Park Service
864 acres in the China Flat area of Jordan Ranch in exchange for 59
acres of national park land in Cheeseboro Canyon.
   Hope is selling other land in the area to developers of a golf
course and luxury housing who need the 59 acres that now belongs to
the government to reach Hope's property.
   As part of the arrangement, the developers have agreed to pay
the Park Service up to $1 million to build a new visitor center for
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and give the
service all revenues from a parking concession at golf tournaments
on the Jordan Ranch.
   Hope also has agreed to sell 4,772 acres in the Santa Monica
Mountains to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state
agency, to be preserved for public park and recreational use.
   Cranston call the deal troubling.
   ``Jordan Ranch has repeatedly been identified for federal
acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area,'' Cranston told the Senate Appropriations interior
subcommittee. ``The Park Service should be seeking to acquire that
property and to protect the resources of Jordan Ranch.''
   Cranston described the ranch as 2,308 acres of pristine canyon
lands and said the property supports an abundant bird population.
   ``I am dismayed that the National Park Service is opening the
door to commercial development of what one day should be national
parkland,'' said Cranston. ``In my judgment they are acting
directly contrary to the mission of the Park Service.''

   A sailor who was afraid of reporting late
to his ship swam across the Columbia River because he figured it

   Police noticed the man in the river before 6 a.m. Tuesday and
expected they would have to rescue him, said Marvin Hoover, a
police officer in Rainier, Ore. Few swimmers attempt the dangerous,
half-mile crossing.
   But the sailor, Armano Joseph Alvarez, climbed out on a dock at
Longview and was met by police who said he was barely winded.
   Alvarez, 21, of Santa Fe Springs, Calif., said he had to make it
back to his ship, the USS Kiska, and thought swimming would be
faster than walking across a bridge, police said. The Kiska was
docked at the Port of Longview overnight, returning to the sea
after a weekend at the Rose Festival in Portland.
   Alvarez was returned to ship in time before it left Longview.
   A Navy spokesman in Seattle, Cmdr. Jim Britt, said if sailor
returned to the ship in time there would be no action taken against
him.

   Pumping iron in the geriatric set does not
necessarily mean gulping down Geritol.
   Researchers say that giving frail 90-year-olds a regimen of
high-intensity weight-training can dramatically increase their
muscle strength and may help them avoid accidents associated with
weak muscles.
   The findings, reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association, are based on a study of 10 residents of a
Boston nursing home, ages 86 to 96.
   ``Our findings suggest that a portion of the muscle weakness
attributed to aging may be modifiable through exercise,'' wrote the
researchers, who were led by Dr. Maria Fiatarone of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center on
Aging at Tufts University in Boston.
   ``Because muscle strength decreases by perhaps 30 percent to 40
percent during the course of the adult life span, it is likely that
at the end of training these subjects were stronger than they had
been many years previously,'' the researchers wrote.
   They called it the first study to examine the effects of
weight-training in such an old population.
   But Kim Herling, who works with the elderly as director of
cardiovascular rehabilitation at the University of Chicago Medical
Center, said the number of subjects in the study was too small to
apply to the general population.
   ``The last thing you'd want to have happen is have a group of
60- to 90-year-old people going out and weight-lifting'' because of
the risk of injury, Ms. Herling said. She said elderly people who
want to lift weights should consult a physician.
   During the study, conducted in the summer of 1988, six women and
four men participated in an eight-week weight-training program that
focused on the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh.
   Three times a week, for eight weeks, the subjects performed leg
lifts with weights for about 45 minutes a session.
   By the end of the eight-week training period, the nine subjects
who completed the study had at least doubled the amount of weight
they could lift, and some had tripled and quadrupled that amount,
said Ms. Fiatarone.
   The average increase in single-leg exercises went from 16 pounds
at the beginning to about 42 pounds by the end of the training, she
said.
   One 86-year-old man stopped after four weeks because of pain at
the site of a previous hernia. The rest completed the training with
little pain and no injuries, the researchers said.
   They called the results ``remarkable'' considering the subjects'
age and poor health condition at the start of the study. Seven had
arthritis, six had heart disease, and four had hypertension.
   The subjects stopped weight-lifting at the end of the eight-week
period, and four weeks later, they had lost about one-third of the
strength they had gained, Ms. Fiatarone said.
   A similar loss would be expected in a younger person, she said,
noting that for the results to be lasting, weight-training must be
done on a long-term basis.
   Although the study focused only on leg muscles, Ms. Fiatarone
said it can be assumed weight-training also would strengthen
upper-body muscles in the elderly.
   The researcher said the results indicate that weight-training
can be used in the elderly to help them gain strength and possibly
avoid the falls and other accidents associated with weakness.
   But Ms. Herling said more research is needed to determine if
weight-training strengthens upper-body muscles in the very old,
adding that those muscles tend to be the weakest in the elderly.
   But she also said that the study ``certainly sheds new light on
the capabilities that these elderly patients ... can achieve, and
that's promising.''

   The United States won't increase the number of
Soviet Jews allowed into this country despite pressure from the
Soviet Union and Arab nations, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Tuesday.
   ``We make the point to the Soviet Union that we have had some
rather dramatic increases in the numbers that we are admitting,
that at this time at least we don't think (the United States can)
permit further increases because of budgetary concerns,'' Baker
told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The unprecedented number of Jews allowed to leave the Soviet
Union in recent months has outraged the Arab world, which is
worried that Israel's population will increase and that emigres
will be settled in territories captured from Jordan and Egypt in
1967.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the Kremlin was
under intense pressure from Arab governments to stop the emigration
to Israel, expected to reach as high as 150,000 this year.
   Gorbachev, at the end of a four-day summit with President Bush
earlier this month, said emigration might be cut off unless Israel
stops settling Soviet Jews in the predominantly Arab West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Israel denies it has such a settlement policy.
   However, Baker said he had been assured by his Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze that the Kremlin would not stop Jewish
emigration despite Gorbachev's warning.
   ``My sense is they (the Soviets) are not going to cut it off,
but that could be ... proven wrong,'' Baker said.
   The Soviet Union is eager for congressional approval of a trade
agreement signed by Bush and Gorbachev at their summit. But
lawmakers told Baker they would withhold support for any trade
concessions if the Soviets stop Jewish emigration.
   Baker said the Soviets have asked if the United States would
accept more Soviet Jews as refugees or immigrants. The United
States, he said, said it had increased the number of permits for
Soviet refugees from 14,000 in 1988 to 50,000 in 1990 and was
taking in another 20,000 Soviets not classified as refugees.

   Shark hunter Frank Mundus, who claims to be
the model for the Quint character in ``Jaws,'' says he's retiring
to Hawaii next year after half a century on the seas off Long
Island.
   ``Anybody that's been in this business for 50 years has to have
his head examined,'' said Mundus, 64.
   Mundus is in the record books for catching the biggest great
white shark ever snared with a rod and reel, a 3,450-pound fish
caught off Montauk Harbor in August 1986.
   Last summer, when Mundus tried to renew his lapsed captain's
license, the Coast Guard discovered he could barely read. He was
denied a license and had to hire a licensed captain to operate his
boat legally.
   After decades of piloting his own boat, he asked, ``What do I
need a bit of paper for?''
   Mundus is a living legend in Montauk, which bills itself as the
fishing capital of the world.
   He claims, and is generally believed, to be the inspiration for
the cantankerous shark hunter who meets his demise in the teeth of
a great white in Peter Benchley's ``Jaws.''
   His opinion of the movie? ``The funniest thing I've ever seen.
Hilarious. Stupid.''
   In October, Mundus sold his charter fishing business and his
boat, Cricket II, to two used car salesmen. He said he intends to
move to Kona, on the island of Hawaii, at the end of the 1991
summer season.

<DATELINE>PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not that folks dislike George
Baker. They simply mind his minesweeper docking along the Black
River.
   ``I feel like an orphan. ... This boat has become my obsession,
too much of an obsession I suppose,'' Baker said of the 98-foot
Atlas. ``Right now though, I need some place to park this damn
thing.''
   Baker, 48, acquired the World War II era vessel in 1988, when it
sat on the bottom of the harbor at Superior, Wis. He raised the
ship, repaired it and brought it his hometown, where he owned a
steel fabrication business.
   In May 1989, Baker sold his steel business, sailed the Atlas to
Algonac, anchored off Harsens Island and began turning the vessel
into a recreational ship for charters he hopes to take in the
Virgin Islands next year.
   Last November, he sailed into Port Huron, working in a factory
by day and spending his free time renovating the Atlas for the trip
next winter to Jacksonville, Fla.
   For now, though, Baker and the Atlas apparently have used up
their welcome in Port Huron.
   Property owners along the Black River already forced Baker to
leave two of his moorings, and the city is threatening to seek a
court order barring the Atlas from any mooring in the city without
permission from the property owner.
   Michael West, a lawyer representing the city, said he knows that
Baker isn't annoying people on purpose, but folks see him as a
nuisance just the same.
   ``We would prefer not to take him to court. I wish he would just
hurry up and move out of here. If he had permission to be where he
is, that would be fine. But he doesn't,'' West said.
   Baker, who has built or owned 54 boats in 30 years, said he
needs just one more berth and a few more weeks on the Black River
before the Atlas will be ready to leave Port Huron forever.
   ``I certainly haven't wanted to stir up a hornet's nest. But the
spring came so late this year I haven't been able to do the work
that's necessary to get this old girl out of here,'' he said. ``I
am trying. Believe me I am trying.''

   The republic of Russia on Tuesday proclaimed its
sovereignty in a sharp break with the central Soviet government,
and deputies said it will begin to chart its own course,
particularly on economic matters.
   The declaration, passed by the republic's legislature, carries
no legal weight, but is to serve as a blueprint for future
decisions on the republic's relations with the central government.
   Some deputies also said the republic had no intention of trying
to secede from the Soviet Union.
   The vote by the Russian Congress of People's Deputies came just
before President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with the heads of all 15
republics, including Russian president Boris N. Yeltsin, who led
the sovreignty drive.
   It was Yeltsin's first public meeting with the Soviet leader
since being elected president of Russia on June 5. The huge
republic has Moscow as its capital and contains two-thirds of
Soviet territory and just over half the country's population.
   Gorbachev summoned the presidents of the republics to begin work
on ``realizing the key idea of deeply reforming our federation,''
he said. The nightly news program ``Vremya'' showed him speaking to
the leaders at a long table in the Kremlin.
   Gorbachev has long promised a revamped treaty among the
republics guaranteeing their sovereignty. But the republic decided
to ``take its fate into its own hands,'' Ruslan Khasbulatov, deputy
chairman of the Congress of the Russian Federation, told reporters.
   He said the sovereignty declaration, although it would have no
immediate legal effect, meant Russia will no longer have to wait
``for intelligent thoughts to come down from above.''
   The announcement of the 907-13 vote on the declaration was met
with a rousing ovation by lawmakers.
   Tuesday's measure was weaker than an original proposal that
would have proclaimed that Russia's sovereignty and total control
of laws on its territory would ``come into force from the moment of
its passage.''
   The version that was passed serves only as a political statement
of intent.
   Khasbulatov said the stronger version ``was unacceptable and
would have called forth a big clash. And we needed to pass the
declaration.''
   ``I think it has great political significance for our
government'' and will hasten decentralization, said Khasbulatov, a
strong supporter of Yeltsin.
   He said Russian leaders were particularly eager to start acting
on their own ideas on economic reform.
   Deputies stressed that the proclamation did not amount to a
declaration of independence like that made by the Baltic republic
of Lithuania.
   ``We didn't declare ourselves a separate government from the
U.S.S.R.,'' Khasbulatov said. ``We think our Russian fate should be
within the framework of the U.S.S.R.''
   Earlier in the day, deputies voted 704-206 not to drop the
``Soviet Socialist'' from the formal name of the Russian Soviet
Federated Socialist Republic.
   Yeltsin has been a strong proponent of Russian sovereignty. He
included it in his platform for the presidency and predicted it
would be declared in the first 100 days of his tenure.
   There was no immediate public reaction to the sovereignty vote
by Gorbachev, who has warned that the Kremlin cannot carry out its
reforms if the Russian heartland is not firmly behind it.
   Yeltsin has said he hopes to cooperate with Gorbachev despite
their personal and political differences, but that his first
priority is defending Russia's interests.

<HEAD>House Approves Program to Find Airliner Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Monday approved a $10 million
research program to develop new technologies and inspection
programs to find defects in airplanes before they cause accidents.
   The bill by Rep. Tom Lewis, R-Fla., was passed on a voice vote
with no opposition. A similar plan is being considered in the
Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.
   The legislation was prompted by the crash landing last July of a
United Airlines DC-10 at Sioux City, Iowa, and an April 1988
accident in which part of the top was ripped off an Aloha Airlines
plane during a short inter-island flight.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said both accidents
could have been prevented through adequate inspection and
maintenance programs.
   For example, the United crash landing _ in which 112 of the 296
aboard were killed _ was caused by an engine failure due to a crack
in a fan disk from a defect when the DC-10 was manufactured in 1971.
   The section of the Aloha airliner was ripped off as the result
of cracks in the outer metal covering that began almost 17 years
earlier but went undetected, the NTSB said.
   In both cases, the Federal Aviation Administration began
mandating inspections of aging airliners for such defects and
cracks only after the accidents.
   ``The status quo for too long has been to do something about a
problem only after it costs lives,'' Lewis said.
   The bill would require the FAA to devote $10 million of its
research over the next three years to addressing the risks of
component failures and coming up with a program to prevent them.

<DATELINE>OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Towering columns of black smoke
and balls of flames were replaced Tuesday by a gray cloud
surrounding the rear section of the crippled supertanker Mega Borg.
   That signaled that firefighters were gaining control of the
blaze after four days.
   Although the plume could be seen on the clear horizon from
Galveston, 57 miles away, the fire clearly was at its lowest level
since the tanker erupted in flames early Saturday during the
transfer of some of its cargo of 38 million gallons of light
African crude oil.
   Five fireboats showered the rear section of the tanker with 10
water cannons _ three of the hoses pointed at the listing left side
and the seven others aimed at the right rear.
   Another water hose was anchored to the deck of the Mega Borg and
pointed toward the fire-ravaged superstructure.
   The superstructure, wracked by explosions and flames for three
days, was engulfed in gray smoke Tuesday.
   The left rear of the ship was extremely close to being awash,
but the thick smoke prevented a view of the stern, which the Coast
Guard said Monday had dipped below the surface of the Gulf of
Mexico.
   Earlier, a long trail of flaming oil snaked from rear of the
ship. But by Tuesday, only a small pool of oil about a half-mile
away was burning. The Coast Guard said later it had burned itself
out.
   A slick of rusty brown oil extended a short distance from the
rear of the ship, while a thin and broader sheen was more
widespread around the vessel.
   One fireboat was fastened to the right side of the tanker,
another vessel moored near the bow on the left side. Blue barrels
containing chemical foam were clearly visible on some of the
fireboats but were untouched as of Tuesday morning. No flames could
be seen.
   A Coast Guard cutter patrolled the area west of the ship while
several other boats, with oil-collecting booms extending from their
sides, were sucking up patches of oil farther from the tanker.
   A mile or so away, the heat from the fire created its own
waterspout, its thin dark finger spinning lazily like a slow-motion
mini-tornado out of the smoke cloud.

<HEAD>Doggie Drive-Thru Offers Fast Food for Fido</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NILES, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Fido goes into a frenzy over fast food,
you can always pick up a dog biscuit shaped like a cheeseburger at
a drive-through window that caters to canines.
   When Maggie Patterson opened her Doggie-Drive-Thru in April, her
idea was met with skepticism.
   ``People told me I was crazy,'' Patterson said Tuesday. ``But
now that I'm open, they tell me it's the greatest idea since sliced
bread.''
   Now besides her homemade dog biscuits in the shapes of french
fries and cheeseburgers, she's trying to develop a pizza-shaped
biscuit and a ``diet'' puffed rice treat for the pooch with a
paunch.
   She mixes and bakes the biscuits using her own recipe of minced
garlic, wheat germ, margarine, eggs, cheddar cheese, molasses, dry
milk and whole wheat flour. She works with a veterinarian and a
hospital dietitian.
   When the owner drives up, Patterson asks the dog's name and then
offers a sample. If the dog seems too shy or aggressive, she'll
have the owner give it the treat.
   After telling her biscuits' ingredients and the prices (45 cents
for a cheeseburger biscuit the size of a large cookie), she gets
the owner to talk about the dog _ something she finds people love
to do.
   ``Meanwhile, the dog is freaking out. He's getting all the
attention and nobody but him is getting anything to eat,'' she said.
   Sometimes, owners take their dog through as a birthday surprise,
and Patterson accommodates by taking the dog's picture as a memento.
   On a busy Saturday, she said as many as 100 cars pull up to her
window.
   The 9-week-old business has created such a craze, Patterson
said, she has received dozens of requests for franchises.
   Patterson, 33, said she owes the idea to her three dogs and
their love of fast-food _ the people kind.
   ``I used to give them cheeseburgers when we'd go through
McDonald's, but they started getting fat,'' she said of her
Labrador, cocker spaniel and poodle. ``But every time they'd see
those golden arches they'd still go crazy.''

   Hurricane Hugo left death and
destruction along South Carolina's coast _ but also, apparently, a
rainbow of flowers.
   Beside the creek here, for example, bright petunias bloom in
yards where they never were planted by human hands. No one knows
for sure where the flowers came from. But many believe Hugo brought
them.
   ``We've got all kinds of stuff out of place. That's the only
logical thing for us to come up with,'' said Georgetown County
agricultural agent Laval Oxendine.
   When Hugo hit in September, the seeds of perennial flowers were
mature and soon would have fallen into bed for the winter. But the
storm's flooding and winds spread the seeds all along the coast,
Oxendine said.
   He said the seeds also may have come from wildflowers being
planted to beautify highways.
   ``(Hugo) brought me a lot of weeds and it killed all my azaleas
and it killed all my dogwoods, but now I have a beautiful yard of
petunias,'' said Norma Thompson, who lives here.

   An anti-smoking measure in a rural town lost
its place in Colorado history when city officials discovered it
hadn't passed after all.
   ``The election judges read the results backwards,'' City
Administrator Roy Lauricello said Monday.
   About 17 percent of the estimated 4,600 registered voters in
this conservative eastern Colorado town voted June 5 on the
proposal to limit smoking in public.
   Afterward, the city said the ordinance passed 431-355, giving
the City Council 60 days to decide how strict to make the
regulations.
   But a recount Monday revealed the measure actually failed by 11
votes, Lauricello said.
   ``I'm in a state of disbelief that an error of this size could
have been made,'' said Mark Simmerman, a public health nurse who
campaigned for the measure.
   Thirty-four Colorado cities and counties have enacted smoking
restrictions, but this would have been the first passed in a rural
town, according to the Group to Alleviate Smoking Pollution.

   A federal appeals court struck down Tuesday a
Securities and Exchange Commission attempt to prevent corporations
from creating unequal voting rights among their stockholders.
   The three-judge appeals panel unanimously ruled in favor of an
association of top corporations that had contended the SEC was
exceeding its authority by imposing a so-called ``one share, one
vote'' rule.
   The rule in question, SEC Rule 19c-4, was adopted in July 1988.
It prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the
voting power of existing stock holders by issuing new classes of
stock with superior or ``supervoting'' rights.
   The court upheld the arguments of The Business Roundtable, which
claimed the rule interfered with corporate governance _ authority
traditionally left to the states.
   The SEC had claimed it had a right to impose the one share, one
vote rule as part of its mission under the 1934 law that created
the commission to protect investors in publicly traded companies.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia disagreed. In an unusually sharp rebuke, the court
chastened the SEC for trying to put its own ``spin on a statutory
fragment.''
   SEC officials had no immediate comment on the ruling, saying
they hadn't yet read it.
   ``It's a very important decision that limits the SEC's attempt
to regulate corporate governance,'' said Washington attorney Robert
D. Rosenbaum, who represented The Business Roundtable in oral
arguments last November before the appeals court.
   The Business Roundtable is an association of 200 corporations,
including such corporate giants as American Express Co., Xerox
Corp., Citicorp and General Mills.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are harvesting a bumper crop of winter
wheat despite some losses from wet weather and lower quality in
some areas, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Production was estimated at a nine-year high of 2.09 billion
bushels. That was down fractionally from the May forecast, but
still 44 percent more than last year's drought-battered harvest of
1.45 billion bushels.
   Figures released by the department's Agricultural Statistics
Board showed the decline from the May forecast was only about 0.1
percent, or less than 2.4 million bushels.
   The average yield, based on indications as of June 1, was
estimated at 41.2 bushels per acre, compared with 41.1 bushels
indicated last month and the 1989 yield of 35.1 bushels.
   Farmers are expected to harvest fewer than 50.7 million acres,
down from 50.8 million indicated in May.
   ``Wet conditions have caused yield declines in the (Mississippi)
Delta area,'' the report said. ``Early harvested fields in Arkansas
had low test weights, and diseases are a problem.''
   The Missouri crop is developing late, with about 23 percent
``turning color'' in the ripening process as of June 3, about 10
days behind the usual pace, the report said.
   In Kansas, winter wheat production was estimated at 460.2
million bushels, unchanged from the May forecast and more than
double the shriveled 1989 harvest of 213.6 million bushels.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the next year.
It accounts for about three-fourths of the U.S. total wheat
production. The remainder is planted in the spring.
   The USDA's first official estimate of 1990 production of all
wheat will be issued July 12. The first estimates for corn,
soybeans and some other major spring-planted crops are scheduled
for Aug. 9, along with revised figures for wheat.
   No official estimates of total 1990 wheat output based on field
surveys were included.
   However, department analysts in a related report did project
``highly tentative'' 1990 production of all wheat at almost 2.69
billion bushels, up from fewer than 2.04 billion bushels last year
and virtually unchanged from the May projection.
   Projections for all wheat and some other crops were based on
yield trends and an assumption the crop would have normal weather
the remainder of the growing season.
   The 1990 corn harvest was projected at 8.1 billion bushels, up
from 7.53 billion harvested last year and unchanged from May.
Soybean production was projected at 1.925 billion bushels, also
unchanged from last month and virtually the same as the crop of
1.927 billion bushels in 1989.
   According to the supply-and-demand report, the U.S. wheat
stockpile was drained to a 15-year low of 452 million bushels on
June 1, the beginning of the new wheat marketing year. But with the
expected larger 1990 harvest, the wheat stockpile could be rebuilt
to about 772 million bushels a year from now.
   The projected larger 1990 wheat harvest is putting pressure on
market prices, which were indicated in both May and June in the
range of $2.90 to $3.30 per bushel in 1990-91, compared with an
estimated $3.71 last season.
   If corn production turns out at the projected level of 8.1
billion bushels, it still wouldn't be quite enough to match
domestic and export demand, the report showed. Thus, the U.S. corn
stockpile, which may be around 1.28 billion bushels next fall,
could edge lower by Oct. 1, 1991.
   Corn prices were projected at $2.35 to $2.75 per bushel in
1990-91, compared with the current season's forecast of $2.35 to
$2.40 per bushel. That was up 10 cents per bushel from last month's
1990-91 projection.
   Soybeans were indicated at an average of $6.25 per bushel in the
1990-91 marketing year that begins Sept. 1, compared with $5.70
this season. That was unchanged from May.

<HEAD>Jury Selection to Begin in Central Park Jogger Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jury selection begins Wednesday in the trial of
three teen-agers accused of raping and beating a Central Park
jogger _ a case that relies mainly on what the defendants told
police about each other.
   The first hurdle will be finding 12 jurors who haven't made up
their mind about the ``wilding'' case, which has received vast
amounts of attention from New York newspapers, radio and television
stations.
   About 500 people are expected in court to form the first pool
from which lawyers will try to pick the dozen jurors and six
alternates. The jury will hear the cases against Antron McCray and
Yusef Salaam, both 16, and Raymond Santana, 15.
   They and three other youths are charged with attacking an
investment banker while she was jogging through the northern end of
Central Park shortly before 10 p.m. on April 19, 1989.
   According to authorities, a pack of more than 30 youths had
entered the north end of the park together for what they called
wilding, a violent rampage through the park. Eventually, splitting
up into smaller groups, they allegedly attacked two male joggers, a
homeless man, and the female jogger, who was gang-raped and left
for dead.
   Police said there were several rapes reported that night, and
there has been at least one equally brutal rape of a woman since.
But the Central Park case was especially shocking to New Yorkers
and continues to hold public attention.
   On Tuesday, Justice Thomas Galligan decided against allowing
audio-visual coverage of the trial, including live televiation and lies
perpetrated
against scared teen-agers and their uncomprehending parents and
guardians.
   Without the statements, defense lawyers said after Galligan's
ruling, the prosecution would have had no case.

   A federal appeals court struck down Tuesday a
Securities and Exchange Commission attempt to prevent corporations
from creating unequal voting rights among their stockholders.
   The three-judge appeals panel unanimously ruled in favor of an
association of top corporations that had contended the SEC was
exceeding its authority by imposing a so-called ``one share, one
vote'' rule.
   The rule in question, SEC Rule 19c-4, was adopted in July 1988.
It prohibited publicly traded corporations from weakening the
voting power of existing stock holders by issuing new classes of
stock with superior or ``supervoting'' rights.
   The court upheld the arguments of The Business Roundtable, which
claimed the rule interfered with corporate governance _ authority
traditionally left to the states.
   The SEC had claimed it had a right to impose the one share, one
vote rule as part of its mission under the 1934 law that created
the commission to protect investors in publicly traded companies.
   But the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia disagreed. In an unusually sharp rebuke, the court
chastened the SEC for trying to put its own ``spin on a statutory
fragment.''
   SEC officials had no immediate comment on the ruling, saying
they hadn't yet read it.
   ``It's a very important decision that limits the SEC's attempt
to regulate corporate governance,'' said Washington attorney Robert
D. Rosenbaum, who represented The Business Roundtable in oral
arguments last November before the appeals court.
   The Business Roundtable is an association of 200 corporations,
including such corporate giants as American Express Co., Xerox
Corp., Citicorp and General Mills.

   The Palestine Liberation Organization must
discipline one of its top leaders as well as publicly condemn an
attempted terrorist attack on Israel to avoid cutoff of its
dialogue with the United States, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III said Tuesday.
   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that ``an
extraordinarily large number of our allies and friendly
governments'' have urged the Bush administration not to
precipitously cut off the contact begun in an effort to promote
peace in the Middle East.
   However, Baker said the United States ``will not allow our
pursuit of peace to undercut our commitment to fight terrorism, and
I think the PLO understands that.''
   The dialogue began in December 1988 after PLO leader Yasser
Arafat renounced terrorism and acknowledged Israel's right to exist.
   In wide-ranging testimony before the panel, Baker summarized
progress made at the recent U.S.-Soviet summit and reiterated
administration hopes that a strategic nuclear weapons treaty can be
sent to the Senate for approval by the end of the year.
   Baker also:
   _Said the United States and the Soviet Union could team up to
sponsor peace talks in Angola, and that a cease-fire could include
agreement by the two superpowers to halt flows of arms to the
warring sides.
   _Said the United States would not increase its ceiling on the
number of Soviet Jews allowed into this country.
   _Predicted Soviet aid to Cuba eventually will be curtailed
because of Moscow's increasing domestic needs.
   _Said the administration accepts that Congress will not approve
a new U.S.-Soviet trade agreement until Moscow eases an economic
embargo against freedom-minded Lithuania.
   _Praised recent multiparty elections in Czechoslovakia in which
pro-democracy groups received a plurality. However, he said the
administration would reserve judgment on the Bulgarian elections,
where the socialist party _ the former communists _ received almost
half the vote.
   _Said Moscow would have to understand U.S. insistence on full
NATO membership for a united Germany and why continuation of th
alliance is indispensable.
   Speaking about the aborted attack against Israel, Baker said he
told NATO foreign ministers meeting last week in Scotland that
there were two conditions for continued U.S. diplomatic contacts
with the group: specific condemnation of the thwarted May 30 attack
on a beach near Tel Aviv, and steps toward disciplining Abul Abbas,
a member of the PLO's executive council and leader of the radical
faction that carried out the attack.
   ``We are hopeful we will get these responses,'' Baker said.
``Not optimistic, but hopeful.''
   So far, PLO statements ``have fallen short of the mark,'' he
told the committee, because they neither specifically condemn the
raid nor indicate the possibility of punishment for Abbas, leader
of the Palestine Liberation Front.
   Baker's comments came as seven senators, including Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, introduced a resolution calling
for a cutoff of the dialogue if the PLO fails to condemn the attack
and expel Abbas from the executive committee ``in the immediate
future.''
   Other sponsors included Sens. Connie Mack, R-Fla., Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., Charles Grassley,
R-Iowa, Bob Graham, D-Fla., and Don Nickles, R-Okla.

<HEAD>New Clash in Central Asia Leaves Another 32 Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Another 32 deaths have been reported in a Soviet
Central Asian republic convulsed by ethnic fighting. The latest
violence brings to 139 the number of people killed in the region
since June 2, the official news agency Tass said Tuesday.
   Tass reported ``the situation is stabilizingp@holesale home
heating oil, which fell
0.49 cent on Monday, added 1.57 cents to close at 48.29 cents a
gallon.
   In natural gas trading, prices were lower almost across the
board. The July contract fell to $1.558 per 1,000 cubic feet from
$1.572 Monday. Only the December and May 1991 contracts managed to
post gains; other contracts settled marginally lower.
   Much of the oil buying was technically motivated, representing a
reaction to the recent steep declines in crude prices.
   Peter Beutel, who tracks the energy markets for Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said gasoline prices were driven higher by short covering,
which is buying by investors who had previously sold under a short
contract. Refiners and others bought crude aggressively against the
gasoline contract, he said.
   Various factors also gave energy brokers an incentive to buy.
   An announcement from Royal Dutch-Shell that it was curtailing
shipments of its petroleum products to the United States in its own
vessels supported prices. The oil giant has been concerned about
liability costs associated with environmental damage from recent
tanker spills.
   News that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
might convene an emergency meeting to discuss oil price weakness
also spurred buying.
   United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba said at a
news conference in Egypt that the oil cartel has begun preparation
for a new OPEC ministerial conference and, ``if neccessity calls
for such an emergency conference, it will be held.''

<HEAD>Havel Calls On Ex-Communist To Form New Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel on Tuesday
told Premier Marian Calfa, an ex-Communist, he can keep his job and
form the country's first democratically elected government in more
than 40 years.
   Havel and Calfa are leaders of the two groups that led last
winter's anti-Communist revolution and won last week's elections.
   The official news agency CTK said Havel tapped Calfa after a
meeting of the leaders of the two groups _ Havel's Civic Forum and
Calfa's Public Against Violence _ agreed Calfa should form the new
government.
   The two groups together won 46 percent of Parliament's 300 seats
in the elections, held Friday and Saturday. They need a
five-eighths majority to push through constitutional reform.
   Calfa's spokesman Ivan Fiala said he believed Calfa would be
ready to present the new government and its program to Parliament
within two weeks.
   Parliament will then elect a new president, almost certainly
Havel, to serve for two years before new elections.
   The leader of Slovakia's conservative Christian Democrats, who
came in third in the election after the Communists, told CTK in an
interview that his party will stay in the opposition.
   ``The Christian Democratic Movement will not join a coalition
with the Civic Forum and will have no participation in the future
government,'' CTK quoted Jan Carnogursky as saying.
   Carnogursky, a former leading dissident, indicated his ambitions
would be limited to his native Slovakia.
   Calfa, a Slovak, was Havel's choice for the premiership. Sources
inside Civic Forum and Public Against Violence made clear before
last weekend's elections however that they were not happy with the
choice of a former Communist.
   Calfa, 44, became premier during the bargaining that led last
December to the formation of a ``government of national
understanding'' dominated by Civic Forum.
   The premier, a lawyer from Slovakia, turned in his Communist
party card in January and since then is said by Havel aides to have
impressed the president with his political skills.
   Calfa was a top candidate for Public Against Violence in the
elections. Civic Forum and its ally won 46 percent of the vote, and
a projected 169 of the 300 seats in the federal Parliament.
   Key officials such as Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and
Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus are considered certain to keep their
jobs.
   It is uncertain who will be interior minister, the government's
top law enforcement official. The incumbent, Richard Sacher, has
come under fire from Civic Forum for alleged reluctance to
investigate the files of the now disbanded Communist secret police.
   A top official of Sacher's People's Party, Josef Bartoncik, was
publicly accused by Havel's aides Saturday of having worked for the
secret police for the last 17 years.
   The People's Party, one of three parties in the Christian
Democratic coalition, denies the accusations.

<HEAD>Baker Says Arms To UNITA Might Be Cut If Elections Promised</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday the United States might consider cutting off arms supplies
to rebels in Angola if the Soviet-supported government agrees to
hold free elections.
   Baker also said the United States and Soviet Union had proposed
joint sponsorship of talks between the Angolan government and the
UNITA rebels on ending the African country's 15-year civil war.
   The United States secretly funnels weapons to UNITA, an acronym
for the first letters in Portuguese of the name of the group, the
Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   U.S. aid has been estimated at between $40 million and $80
million annually. The State Department contends the Soviets provide
the Angolan government weapons worth about $600 million to $800
million a year.
   Asked at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
about a Soviet suggestion that both sides stop arming their allies
in Angola, Baker said ``that would be a part, I think, ... of an
agreement perhaps, if we could ever once get to a cease-fire and a
commitment that there could, in fact, be open, free and fair
elections.''
   A U.S.-backed cease-fire between the warring sides failed last
summer, and repeated attempts to start peace talks through the
mediation of Zaire's President Mobutu Sese Seko failed.
   A possible breakthrough occurred last April, when the rebels and
government representatives met in Portugal and agreed to meet
again. But Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos still refuses
to accept UNITA's demands for free elections in the one-party state.
   ``I think there is potential for moving toward peace in Angola
as a consequence of United States-Soviet cooperation'' in various
parts of the world, Baker told the committee.
   Baker said that when he met with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, at Namibia's independence celebrations last March,
the United States proposed joint sponsorship of Angolan peace
talks, ``and the Soviets thought it would be a good idea.''
   Soviet and U.S. cooperation in resolving conflicts in their
spheres of influence around the world has already led to the
agreement for Namibia's independence from South Africa. Also,
Presidents Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev announced at the end of their
summit earlier this month that they had agreed to fly U.S. food on
Soviet planes to starving Ethiopians.
   Meanwhile, a group of black leaders met with House Speaker Tom
Foley, D-Wash., Tuesday seeking a congressional review of U.S.
policy towards Angola, including a cutoff of aid to UNITA.
   ``It didn't produce much in the way of concrete results,''
Randall Robinson of the Transafrica lobbying group said of the
meeting. He said he and others were ``not pleased'' with the lack
of urgency expressed by Foley and Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich., and
Steny Hoyer, D-Md.
   Jesse Jackson, one of the blacks who attended the hour-long
meeting, said the bottom line was that the Democrats have been
working hand-in-hand with Republicans in promoting the current
policy on Angola.
   Jeff Biggs, a spokesman for Foley, said the House members were
interested in the black leaders' views but they made no immediate
commitment on policy.

   The Congress of the Russian Federation proclaimed
sovereignty on Tuesday with a declaration that carried no legal
force but pointed to a wish for greater independence from the
Soviet central government.
   The Union Treaty mentioned several times in the declaration
refers to a future voluntary agreement among Soviet republics
incorporating them into the country under newly negotiated terms.
It is not known when the treaty will be offered up for negotiating,
nor what its terms will be.
   Here are excerpts of the 15-point declaration, translated by The
Associated Press:

<TEXT>
   The First Congress of People's Deputies (of the Russian
federation), aware of its historical responsibility for the fate of
Russia, testifying to its respect for the sovereign rights of all
peoples united by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,
expressing the will of the people, solemnly proclaims the state
sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic on
all its territory and declares its determination to create a
democratic, law-based state in the framework of the renewed Soviet
Union.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic is a sovereign
state created by the peoples who united in it historically. The
sovereignty of the (republic) is a natural and necessary condition

(Russian) Constitution and (the republic's) laws on all the
territory of the (republic); the validity of acts of the Soviet
Union that contradict the sovereign rights of the (republic) are
suspended by the republic on its territory. Disagreements between
the republic and the Union are resolved according to a procedure
set in the Union Treaty.

<HEAD>New Crayons Let Kids Color the Sky Cerulean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kids in the '90s will have bolder, brighter
Crayola crayons: fuchsia, dandelion and cerulean _ a fancy word for
sky blue.
   Crayons in orange red, violet blue and other boring _ er, simple
_ colors their parents and grandparents used will fade into history.
   For the first time since 1972, the company is adding eight
colors and for the first time since Crayola crayons were created in
1903, retiring eight others.
   ``We're introducing the new colors in response to what kids told
us they wanted,'' said Brad Drexler, spokesman for Binney and
Smith, the maker of Crayola crayons in this eastern Pennsylvania
city.
   The company interviewed about 150 children aged 7 and under more
than a year ago, and learned that they wanted crayons in bolder,
brighter colors, Drexler said.
   Binney and Smith developed new hues, and gave them upbeat names
like wild strawberry, vivid tangerine, teal blue, royal purple and
jungle green, as well as fuchsia, dandelion and cerulean.
   To make room in the deluxe 72-crayon case, Binney and Smith
decided to discontinue the colors blue gray, green blue, violet
blue, orange red, orange yellow, lemon yellow, maize, and raw umber.
   For example, Drexler said the ``bright and brilliant'' dandelion
replaces maize, ``a dull, pale, almost mustard yellow.''
   Crayon packs with the new colors are already being shipped from
the plant, but they may not appear on store shelves until July,
Drexel said.
   The largest package of 72 crayons comes in a plastic case with a
handle, what Drexler called a ``yuppie'' version of the classic
64-pack that dates from 1957. It was upgraded in 1972 with eight
fluorescent colors.
   Binney and Smith makes 2 billion crayons a year, Drexler said.

Lothar de Maiziere rejected a Soviet suggestion Tuesday that a
united Germany be only an associate member of NATO.
   Bush said, however, that it was a proposal that U.S. and Soviet
officials would discuss ``without rancor'' in an effort to reach
agreement.
   And de Maiziere, who met with Bush on Monday, said he sees Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev coming closer together over
the military stance of a unified Germany.
   Gorbachev said in a speech to the Supreme Soviet legislature
Tuesday that he could accept a German associate status in NATO,
provided there were no changes in the ``mutual obligations'' that
East Germany now has to the Eastern bloc and West Germany to NATO.
   Bush reiterated his insistence that the new Germany belongs in
the Western military alliance with no strings attached and said the
latest proposal sounded similar to what Gorbachev discussed at the
superpower summit here two weeks ago.
   ``But the more talking we do, the more convinced I am that they
will see that what we're proposing is more stabilizing and is best
for the Soviet Union as well as Western Europe and Eastern
Europe,'' Bush said.
   De Maiziere told the National Press Club that he, too, rejected
Gorbachev's latest idea.
   ``We have heard in the past a series of Soviet proposals on what
the solution could be,'' de Maiziere said. ``And now we have one
from President Gorbachev. I believe it is one of the proposals that
will be discussed but it won't be the solution.''
   He said he relayed to Bush a position that Gorbachev presented
to him during the Warsaw Pact summit in Moscow last week, moving
toward a treaty covering the temporary presence of Soviet troops in
East Germany after East and West Germany unify.
   ``And I had the impression that he (Bush) listened with great
interest,'' de Maiziere said.
   The East German leader, who came to power as a result of East
Germany's first free elections last March 18, said he was
sympathetic to Soviet concerns about withdrawing troops from East
Germany.
   Gorbachev insists that the 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in
East Germany remain there for a transitional period.
   ``Of course, we're trying to establish a sovereign, united
Germany,'' de Maiziere said. ``It remains to be seen whether we can
find a treaty settlement that contains the presence of troops for a
specified time.
   ``We accept that the immediate withdrawal is neither socially
nor ecologically nor economically feasible,'' he said.
   The two Germanys are merging their currencies on July 2 and are
headed toward full political union.

   Rock 'n' roller Chubby Checker vowed
to go on with the show Tuesday after his touring bus struck a
tractor-trailer, leaving six members of his entourage injured.
   ``Everybody lived. It seems like nothing fatal happened,''
Checker said after the early morning accident on Interstate 35,
just north of the Texas line. ``No one's near death. We're getting
a truck together and we're getting a couple cars and we're going on
to San Antonio.
   ``I think we're OK enough to do a show tonight.''
   Checker's bus was traveling south on the highway when it struck
a semi-tractor trailer that was pulling onto the highway from a
rest stop, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said.
   The six injured passengers, including Checker's brother, Spencer
Evans, were treated at three hospitals for mostly minor injuries.
The most seriously injured was the bus driver, who was listed as
stable, authorities said.
   The driver of the truck was not injured, the patrol said.
   Checker, 48, gained international fame in the early 1960s for
popularizing the dance the twist.

   The United States and Chile have reached
agreement on procedures for Chile to pay compensation to the family
of a former Chilean diplomat who was assassinated in Washington in
1976, the State Department said Tuesday.
   Orlando Letelier and an associate died in a car bombing, and
U.S. authorities blamed agents of the military government that then
ruled Chile.
   Chile's new, 3-month-old government has agreed to pay
compensation for the deaths of Letelier and Ronni Moffitt without
admission of official liability by the previous government.
   The military government ignored a 1980 order by a U.S. federal
district judge to pay families of the victims $2.9 million.
   An international commission, set up years ago to help settle
bilateral disputes, will determine the amount of compensation to be
paid, the State Department said. The Chilean Congress then will be
asked to approve the request.
   The bilateral agreement outlining the procedure was signed
Monday.
   Letelier, an outspoken opponent of the military government, had
served as foreign minister and held other high posts in the
government of leftist President Salvador Allende.
   The State Department statement referred only briefly to the
question of culpability for the murders.
   ``Both governments recognize that bringing to trial those
responsible for the murders of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt
is of utmost importance,'' it said.
   During the administration of President Augusto Pinochet, Chilean
authorities refused to turn over three security officers wanted in
the United States for the killings.
   But a few weeks after Pinochet turned over the presidency to an
elected successor, Patricio Alwyn, the Chilean Supreme Court
decided to reopen the case.
   A Cuban exile who had eluded authorities for 12 years was
arrested April 11 in St. Petersburg, Fla., on five felony charges
related to the bombing.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, indicted in 1978 with seven
others, has pleaded innocent to the charges.

   Five states sued Mobil Chemical Co. on Tuesday,
charging the company falsely claimed its Hefty trash bags and
grocery bags would decompose.
   Mobil announced in March that it would stop referring to its
Hefty bags as biodegradable because of confusion about what
degradable means.
   Lawsuits were filed by Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas,
California and Wisconsin. New York and Washington state were also
expected to file lawsuits.
   The lawsuits contend Mobil made false claims for the Hefty bags
in advertisements by saying they break down when exposed to sun,
wind and rain.
   Allen Gray, a spokesman for Mobil Chemical, said the company had
been talking with states and had hoped to resolve questions about
its claims without a lawsuit.
   ``We're disappointed here,'' he said, and noted that the company
already voluntarily agreed to drop its claims for bags because
there is no agreement on how to define the term biodegradable.
   The Massachusetts lawsuit said the degradability claim violated
the state Consumer Protection Act. The bags do not perform as
promised because they are ultimately incinerated or disposed of in
landfills, where they decompose no faster than ordinary plastic
bags, the lawsuit alleges.
   ``Promoting plastics as degradable may actually cause consumers
to increase the amount of their litter because they may believe
that the products will degrade rapidly if littered,'' said the
lawsuit filed in Superior Court at Suffolk County.
   In March, Gray said claims that the bags degrade in sunlight had
been fully substantiated by tests and that the company never said
the bags would be the answer to the country's waste disposal
problem.
   The company said it would continue to make Hefty trash bags with
an ``environmentally safe additive'' that speeds up their
decomposition when exposed to sunlight.
   Gray conceded that, ``If left out in Arizona somewhere as bag
with the additive can quickly decompose in a couple of months, but
in a northern climate like Chicago it could take well over a year.''
   Mobil made its announcement shortly before it was to meet with a
task force of state attorney generals investigating deceptive
advertising and packaging.
   Massachusetts is seeking civil penalties of $5,000 for each
violation of the state Consumer Protection Act. In Massachusetts,
Mobil sold or distributed an estimated 112,000 cases of Hefty bags
and more than 75 million Marketote grocery sacks between June and
December of 1989, according to the lawsuit.
   Tom McNaught, a spokesman for state Attorney General James
Shannon, said the state also wanted assurances that Mobil has
permanently dropped the degradability references.
   Minnesota is seeking $250,000 in damages.
   ``Unfortunately, Mobil's advertising claims break down faster
than their garbage bags,'' said Minnesota Attorney General Hubert
Humphrey III at a news conference in St. Paul, Minn.
   The California lawsuit seeks civil penalties of $500,000 and an
injunction to formally halt the ads.
   In Wisconsin, Attorney General Don Hanaway said, ``These claims
prey on people's desire to play a role in protecting the
environment.''
   Hefty bags need to be exposed to a minimum of 26 to 42 days of
sunlight in Arizona or Florida, and up to six months in other parts
of the United States, to trigger degradation of the bags, according
to the lawsuits.

<HEAD>Bush Lauds Gorbachev Talks with Baltic Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush hailed talks between Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Baltic leaders on Tuesday as a
``heartening development'' in the long standoff between Moscow and
the three independence-minded republics.
   ``I hope that out of that comes a further step towards
self-determination for the Baltics,'' Bush said. ``I view dialogue
as something that's very important.''
   The president said he is still weighing whether to end talks
with the Palestine Liberation Organization to protest the May 30
guerrilla attack on an Israeli beach. He said the attack should be
``condemned and those who did it condemned.''
   The PLO issued a statement on Monday renouncing terrorism, but
not specifically renouncing the beach attack.
   Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden, Bush expressed
satisfaction with Gorbachev's meetings with the leaders of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia.
   ``I think that's a heartening development,'' Bush said.
   ``I view dialogue as something that's very important. I've said
all along we want dialogue to go forward.''
   Gorbachev ``knows I have a difference with him on the status of
Lithuania, the United States never having recognized its
incorporation into the Soviet Union,'' Bush added.
   Bush commented as he took questions from reporters after giving
a talk reiterating his support for a constitutional amendment to
outlaw flag desecration
   Gorbachev, trying to resolve the impasse, met with Lithuanian
President Vytautas Landsbergis and with the leaders of the two
other Baltic states for the first time on Tuesday since he declared
their independence moves illegal.
   Bush, asked whether he had decided to end the dialogue with the
PLO that began in December 1988 to protest the thwarted attack on a
Tel Aviv beach by Palestinian guerillas, replied: ``No decision on
that yet.''
   ``There's quite a bit going on behind the scenes. But I just
can't tell you,'' he said.
   Bush said he had discussed the attack on the phone earlier
Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ``But I'm not
prepared to make my decision known on that yet,'' he said.
   ``I want to see that terrorist act condemned, and those who did
it condemned,'' he added.
   On other subjects, Bush:
   _Declined to comment on a published report that linked the CIA
to the arrest of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in 1962,
saying ``I haven't looked into it'' yet. But, he said, ``I'm very
pleased that he's coming here.'' Mandela will visit Washington on
June 25.
   _Declared he feels like ``a spring colt'' on his 66th birthday.
``It's been a good birthday. I hadn't thought so. But good cake,
good cards and _ not bad.''
   _Cheered Texas Ranger pitcher Nolan Ryan's setting of a new
major league record by pitching his sixth no-hitter on Monday.
``Look, what's Nolan, 43? Just the tops _ top human being and a top
performer. And it's a great symbol for the kids around this country
that love baseball as much as I do.''
   Bush's oldest son, George W. Bush, is a part-owner of the
Rangers. ``It was a wonderful moment. I wish I'd been there,'' the
president said.

   A judge said an Internal Revenue Service
agent was incompetent and rude in her dealings with a couple who
owed back taxes.
   U.S. District Judge B. Avant Edenfield on Monday removed IRS
agent Sherilyn Heyward from the case of Brenda and Alan Stout,
owners of a Garden City convenience store.
   ``The combination of incompetence and rudeness with which the
Stouts were treated at the hands of Heyward and her supervisor is
unacceptable,'' the judge's order said, adding that it
``demonstrates the IRS's lack of organization and respect for the
taxpayers.''
   The judge last month voided a search warrant he had approved for
a search of the Stout's business. The affidavit contended Mrs.
Stout was switching bank accounts in an effort to conceal assets
and avoid paying $10,900 in back taxes.
   The Stouts have complained that IRS officials gave them four
different figures to satisfy the taxes. Their business was raided
May 10 by six agents who took $2.46 belonging to an employee and
money collected from the sale of novelty clowns by a private
citizen, evidence showed.
   The agents also rifled through business records, froze the
company's bank account and filed a lien on the company that
supplies the business oil and gas.
   The Stouts are now trying to sell their business to satisfy the
IRS bill.
   The judge said the IRS agent's affidavit was probably
intentionally misleading. While the affidavit said the Stouts owed
$7,532.95 plus penalties, it did not mention nearly $90,000 in back
taxes were paid within the last year.
   Heyward could not be reached for comment Tuesday afternoon.
Telephone information in Savannah lists only an S. Heyward with a
non-published number.
   An IRS spokesman in Atlanta said the agency's lawyers would
review the order before issuing a response.

<HEAD>Single Berlin Government Meets for First Time in Four Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single Berlin government met for the first
time in four decades on Tuesday and decided to swiftly demolish the
rest of the Berlin Wall.
   City council members from both sides of the city gathered in
East Berlin's historic Rotes Rathaus, a monumental red-brick
building that was the seat of local government for more than a
century.
   The two councils agreed to begin on Wednesday the final
demolition of the wall that split the city for 29 years.
   ``We are already now one city,'' said East Berlin Mayor Tino
Schwierzina, who was elected in East Germany's first free local
elections in May.
   One section of wall is to remain standing as a memorial to the
people who were killed trying to flee from East Germany to the West.
   The demolition is to be completed by July 2, when the two German
states are to merge their economies in the major step to full
unification.
   The meeting of the West Berlin Senate and the East Berlin
Magisrat was the first involving local officials from both Berlins
since 1948, after Germany and its capital were both carved in two
by the victorious World War II Allies.
   The two councils, which meet separately once a week, plan to
meet jointly every two weeks until full unification takes place and
a single government is chosen in new local elections.
   East Germany's former Communist government was toppled by mass
protests in October and the wall was opened in November. Since
then, Germans have been able to pass back and forth between the
cities and the two nations.
   Border crossings still are staffed by guards on both sides of
the wall and cursory passport checks are still made. Foreigners can
pass only through two points.
   Some of the most famous stretches of the Berlin Wall have
already been demolished, but most of the wall still snakes around
West Berlin.
   Berlin was divided into four sectors following World War II,
with the Soviets in control of the East and France, Britain and the
United States in control of the West.
   East Berlin is the capital of East Germany, but West Berlin is
still technically under military occupation and not part of the
territory of West Germany.
   The four Allies are expected to negotiate an end to their direct
involvement in the cities during the series of ongoing talks that
also are dealing with the future strategic allegiance of a united
Germany.
   The Allies are to hold their next negotiations on June 22 in
East Berlin.
   ``The unity process in Berlin is being carried out considerably
faster than in any place else in Germany, but also the problems are
greater than anywhere else,'' West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper told
a news conference after the council meeting.
   Last week, U.S. officials said they would take down Checkpoint
Charlie, the Allied checkpoint that was perhaps the world's most
famous border crossing and a symbol of the Cold War.
   Many Germans expect that Berlin will return as the capital of
Germany after unification. The West German seat of government was
moved to Bonn after the war.

<TEXT>
   Eight of 10 Americans believe patients should
be allowed to die in some circumstances and about half say some
incurably ill people have a moral right to commit suicide,
according to a poll released Tuesday.
   The poll, by the Times Mirror Center for The People and The
Press, was conducted a month before Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a retired
pathologist in Pontiac, Mich., assisted in the June 4 suicide of
Janet Adkins, who had been diagnosed as being in the early stages
of Alzheimer's disease.
   Diane Colasanto, a researcher for the Times Mirror Center who is
based in Princeton, N.J., said the survey did not include any
questions about physician-assisted suicide, but added, ``I think
what we found is relevant to the Kevorkian case.''
   The survey found that 80 percent of those polled believed there
are some circumstances in which a patient should be allowed to die.
Only 15 percent thought doctors and nurses should always do
everything possible to save a patient's life.
   Forty-nine percent said a person with an incurable disease has
the moral right to commit suicide, compared with the 40 percent who
expressed such a view in a 1975 Gallup poll.
   Fifty-five percent said there is a moral right to commit suicide
if a person is suffering great pain with no hope of improvement.
Forty-one percent held such a view in the 1975 survey.
   Susan M. Wolf, a lawyer with the Hastings Center, a research
institute in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., that studies medical ethics,
said there is a clear distinction between a doctor withholding life
support and a doctor assisting in a suicide.
   ``Both medical ethics and law treat those things as exact
opposites of one another,'' she said. ``In both ethics and law, it
is very widely agreed now that the doctor is really mandated to
stop life-sustaining treatment at the patient's request. On the
other hand, when you get to the question of physician-assisted
suicide, both medical ethics and the criminal law roundly condemn
that as it stands.''
   Many states have right-to-die laws, but the question has
remained a controversial one. The Supreme Court is expected to rule
soon on the efforts of a Missouri couple to remove life support
from their 31-year-old daughter, Nancy Cruzan, who was severely
brain damaged in a car crash. The Justice Department has sided with
the state of Missouri in attempting to block removal of the
life-support equipment.
   In 1985, the Lou Harris polling organization asked whether a
patient who was terminally ill, with no hope in sight, had the
right to ask a doctor to be put out of misery. Sixty-one percent
said, ``Yes;'' 31 percent said it would be wrong to make such a
request.
   Ms. Colasanto said the percentage of affirmative responses was
an increase over previous polls on the same question.
   A poll last year by Opinion Research Associates said that 66
percent of people surveyed believed a physician should be allowed
by law to end the life of an incurably ill patient, she said.
   Kevorkian has not been charged. Oakland County Circuit Judge
Alice Gilbert ordered him to stop using a device he calls the
suicide machine or taking other steps to help people kill
themselves until prosecutors decide whether to try him. Prosecutors
say toxicological tests on Ms. Adkins' brain, to determine whether
the 54-year-old, Portland, Ore., woman had Alzheimer's disease,
will take up to two months.
   The Times Mirror center, an adjunct of the Times Mirror
publishing and broadcasting organization, conducted telephone
interviews with 1,213 adults from May 1 to May 5. It said the
results are subject to an error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

   President Bush, saying flag desecration is
``unacceptable and must carry a price,'' asked Congress on Tuesday
to pass a constitutional amendment restoring special protection by
the Fourth of July.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he would allow a vote within
two weeks, but added that he would break tradition and vote on the
measure himself in order to emphasize his opposition to what he saw
as meddling with the First Amendment. Foley accused Bush of trying
to ``take political advantage'' from an issue that goes to the
heart of the Bill of Rights.
   ``What that flag encapsules is too sacred to be abused,'' Bush
said at the White House after receiving on his 66th birthday a
miniature replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial, the Marines' famed
flag-raising sculpture.
   Bush joined Republican lawmakers in demanding quick action from
the Democratic-controlled House and Senate on the amendment, which
would restore legal protections wiped out by Supreme Court rulings
last June and again on Monday.
   Foley, D-Wash., said they would get their vote, but he also said
he didn't like what was being done in the name of patriotism.
   ``Every country has a flag. We are one of the few countries that
has a Bill of Rights,'' he said before Bush spoke.
   ``To make it a partisan issue, to attempt to take political
advantage out of a question that has a deep relevance to the
protection of our constitutional integrity and to the protection of
the First Amendment, is not in my judgment worthy of the president,
and I'm sorry he's doing it,'' Foley said.
   Bush said it was not a partisan issue, but he said ``You're darn
right'' when asked if he planned to talk about the flag in the
upcoming election campaign.
   He said the amendment was ``an American issue. And so I call on
the Congress to act by July Fourth, this nation's birthday.''
   ``The law books are full of restrictions on free speech and we
ought to have this be one of them,'' said the president. Flag
burning ``endangers the fabric of our country and I think it ought
to be outlawed,'' he said.
   Bush said the amendment is ``the surest, safest way to guarantee
that while speech remains free, flag desecration is unacceptable
and must carry a price.''
   He lavished praise on the replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial by
sculptor Felix Deweldon of Oregon. They were joined in the Rose
Garden by Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., who fought at Iwo Jima, where
almost 7,000 Americans perished in the 1945.
   Hatfield voted against the constitutional amendment last year,
but his office said he would reluctantly support it now.
   Earlier, GOP leaders emerged from a strategy meeting with Bush
sharply criticizing the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling Monday striking
down the federal flag protection law enacted last October.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., pulling a small flag
from his pocket, said he would press for a vote on Thursday, Flag
Day.
   ``The Democrats should give us a very quick vote,'' said Dole.
``We don't need more hearings.''
   He took a jab at Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, who
voted to uphold the federal law but in his dissent criticized
politicians who ``manipulate the symbol of national purpose ... for
partisan disputes.''
   ``We're not manipulating,'' snapped Dole. He said Stevens has a
right to criticize politicians, ``and we have a right to criticize
the court, and they're wrong.''
   Bush made an issue in the 1988 campaign of his opponent Michael
Dukakis' veto as governor of Massachusetts of a law that would have
penalized public school teachers who refused to lead the Pledge of
Allegiance.
   Bush went to the actual Iwo Jima Memorial in nearby Arlington,
Va., last June 30 to unveil his proposed amendment, which states:
``The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit the
physical desecration of the flag of the United States.''
   That was two days after the first Supreme Court ruling striking
down state laws that made flag desecration a crime. The Senate
subsequently fell 15 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed
to pass the Bush amendment. It got a bare 51-48 majority.
   The Bill of Rights, comprising the first 10 amendments to the
Constitution, has never been amended.
   A constitutional amendment requires two-thirds majorities in
both the Senate and House and approval by 38 of the 50 state
legislatures.
   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, said Tuesday, ``We're called
upon in this body to decide what is more sacred _ the Constitution
or the flag. It would seem to me the Constitution is more sacred.''

   Wrong-size bolts were fitted to a jetliner
windshield that blew out in flight, sucking the pilot halfway out
the cockpit, government officials said Tuesday.
   British Airways said a maintenance engineer involved in the
installation was suspended, as standard procedure during inquiries.
   Cabin staff saved pilot Tim Lancaster, 41, on Sunday, clutching
his ankles as he was bounced against the nose cone for 15 minutes
over England until the co-pilot of the twin-engine BAC 1-11 made an
emergency landing at Southampton.
   An interim report from the Department of Transport's Air
Accident Investigation Branch said the diameter of 84 of the 90
bolts was too small for the captive nuts into which they fitted to
hold the windshield in place.
   Lancaster suffered broken bones, bruises and frostbite but
Southampton General Hospital said it expected to discharge him
Wednesday.
   Investigators said the blowout occurred as the 18-year-old
aircraft was climbing from Birmingham airport at 17,000 feet
carrying six crew and 81 passengers bound from Birmingham to
Malaga, Spain.
   The 2-by-3-foot windshield was found on the ground.
   Investigators were trying to find out if the bolts were wrongly
manufactured or incorrectly packaged when delivered or if the
airline's own engineers selected the wrong bolts.
   They said the windshield was fitted during routine maintenance
the day before the incident, not two days, and the plane was at
17,000 feet when the blowout took place, not 23,000 feet _ as
earlier reported.
   British Airways was checking out all its 34 BAC 1-11s.

<TEXT>
   Israel's Arab neighbors warned Tuesday the
Jewish state's new right-wing government is a threat to the peace
process and could lead to war.
   In a statement, the Egyptian government said Israel has
apparently begun ``to prepare for aggression and war.''
   The official Cairo Radio reported that President Hosni Mubarak
telephoned President Bush to ``discuss current developments in the
Middle East.'' The radio gave no further details.
   Egypt is the only Arab state to have signed a peace treaty with
Israel.
   In Jordan, King Hussein called the new Israeli government a
``dangerous threat'' and reiterated his call for a peaceful
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   ``The form of the new Israeli government constitutes a dangerous
threat to the stability of this region because the foundations
which led to the establishment of this government make it the most
extremist Israeli government ever formed,'' Hussein told the
visiting Soviet deputy foreign minister, Vladimir Petrovsky.
   Hussein's statements were carried by Jordan's official Petra
news agency.
   On Monday, Parliament narrowly approved a new government headed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc. The
governing coalition also includes several far-right and religious
factions.
   The government has promised new measures to crush the
30-month-long Palestinian rebellion against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and is committed to increasing Jewish
settlement in those areas.
   Shamir's alliance has also ruled out any direct or indirect
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. One two-man party
within the governing coalition advocates the expulsion of Arabs
from the occupied territories.
   In Syria, President Hafez Assad warned of a new war with the
Jewish state and said a confrontation will be bloodier than any of
the previous wars.
   Speaking at a session of the National Council, or Parliament,
Assad said: ``Wars today will not be like the wars fought in the
past which left low casualties.''
   Assad said Israel remains ``technologically superior and can
cause disasters in times of war. However, the Arabs can reciprocate
and the disasters will be more serious to Israel.''
   Israel has fought four wars against its Arab neighbors since the
Jewish state declared independence in 1948. Israel emerged
victorious in the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, but at
considerable cost.
   Israel also invaded Lebanon in 1982 in an effort to drive the
PLO from that country. Israel withdrew the bulk of its invasion
force in 1985, but still maintains a small security strip along its
northern frontier.
   Tensions in the Middle East have been increasing as Arab
countries continue to stockpile missiles and develop chemical
weapons in an effort to match Israel's military superiority.

   The House, in the face of an administration
veto threat, voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to send President Bush a
bill allowing federal workers to take an active role in politics
for the first time in half a century.
   By a 334-87 vote, the House forfeited its own version of Hatch
Act changes to adopt a Senate bill that is less onerous to the
White House but is still opposed by top administration officials.
   Ninety of the 176 Republicans, including Minority Leader Robert
H. Michel of Illinois, joined 244 Democrats to pass the bill. Three
Democrats _ Reps. Anthony Beilenson of California, Charles Bennett
of Florida and Thomas Foglietta of Pennsylvania _ voted against the
measure.
   Unlike the original House bill approved more than a year ago,
the measure that being sent to Bush retains prohibitions against
federal workers running for partisan office or soliciting campaign
funds from the public.
   The Senate passed the same bill last month by a vote of 67-30,
but GOP leaders there have expressed confidence they can persuade
one or two of their colleagues to change votes to sustain a veto.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a letter Tuesday that
he and other senior Bush advisers would recommend that the
president veto the bill.
   ``Such a reversal in the role of partisan politics in the ethic
of public service would permit virtually unbridled partisan
activities by federal employees,'' Thornburgh said in a letter to
House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   As passed by both houses, the bill substantially erases
prohibitions under the 51-year-old Hatch law that restrict th
nation's 3 million federal civil service and postal employees to
little more than voting.
   If enacted into law, those employees could begin holding office
in local, state and national political party organizations for the
first time. They also could solicit campaign funds from co-workers
on behalf of federal employee union political action committees,
but only when not working.
   However, federal workers would still be prohibited from running
in a partisan election for public office or soliciting campaign
funds from anyone other than fellow members of government employee
unions.
   The original House version approved by a 297-90 vote in April
1989 would have allowed government workers to take leaves of
absence to run for partisan office and solicit campaign funds from
anyone.
   ``Government workers in the Soviet Union enjoy more freedom to
practice politics than America's government workers,'' said Rep.
William Ford, D-Mich., one of the bill's sponsors.
   ``We are not advocating the gray masses ... rising up in a
coup,'' Ford said. ``We're only asking for the simple right to put
up a yard sign, display a bumper sticker, send a check or stuff
envelopes.''
   The Hatch Act was enacted at the height of the New Deal to
protect the emerging civil service from being coerced by political
appointees to contribute to or work on behalf of candidates.
   ``The Americans who guide the planes we fly ... and who deliver
the mail deserve our trust in the very modest right to participate
in the political process,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.
   Opponents argue that the law's protections against a spoils
system are still needed.
   ``Times have changed but the factors that make the Hatch Act
necessary have not changed,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va. ``Human
nature has not been repealed by Congress. The inevitable result
will be a politicizing of the federal work force.''

   It took Jeffrey Card exactly one day to
go from mortarboard to school board.
   Card graduated Sunday from Richmond High School. On Monday, he
was elected to a four-year term on the Board of Education in this
rural community 30 miles northeast of Detroit.
   Card missed the April filing deadline for board candidates, but
not on purpose; he wasn't old enough. He turned 18 May 16. Waging a
write-in campaign, he collected 703 votes to 545 for Victoria
Bonino, 30, the only other candidate on the ballot.
   The new board member said he decided to run after his father
died about 1{ years ago at age 41 of a brain tumor.
   ``If you want to take advantage of life, you'd better do it
now,'' said Card, who plans to attend the University of Detroit on
a scholarship this fall.
   Card will have his hands full when he's sworn in July 1. While
Richmond voters were electing him, they also rejected proposed tax
increases for school buses and equipment.

   The makers of Midol, a menstrual relief
medication, agreed Tuesday to pay $375,000 in fines to settle a
complaint that the company had made unsubstantiated advertising
claims.
   The consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission ``is
without admission of any wrongdoing,'' said Terry Kelley, a
spokesman for Sterling Drug Inc., which makes Midol.
   Kelley said the company, the nation's largest manufacturer of
over-the-counter menstrual relief medicine, entered into the
agreement ``to avoid protracted, costly litigation.''
   It would have involved ``highly technical scientific issues,''
said Kelley.
   ``This does not involve our current advertising,'' Kelley said,
explaining that all of the questionable advertising had been
stopped by March. ``Sterling will continue to manufacture and
market the Midol brand products.''
   The FTC said Sterling had violated a 1985 order prohibiting a
firm from making performance claims ``unless it has a reasonable
basis to substantiate the claims.''
   The complaint said Sterling ran certain ads for ``Original
Formula Midol'' and ``Maximum Strength Midol for Cramps'' from
March 1985 to January 1986 and in April 1988 that claimed or
implied one of the ingredients was a muscle relaxant for menstrual
cramps that would quickly help relieve muscle contractions.
   ``The company did not have competent and reliable scientific
evidence for those claims,'' the agency said in its complaint.
   ``The ingredient in question has been removed from the
product,'' according to Sterling.
   Virtually all of the company's products were included in the
FTC's advertising complaint.
   Also cited were ads for ``Maximum Strength Midol PMS'' which
claimed ``total'' or ``complete relief'' for the symptoms of
premenstrual syndrome.
   The FTC also said the company had ``no competent and reliable
scientific evidence'' for claims that ``Original Midol Muti-Symptom
Formula'' and ``Maximum Strength Midol Multi-Symptom Formula''
relieved menstrual bloating and water-weight gain.
   Sterling is based in New York City and is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Eastman-Kodak Co.

   The Pentagon's top personnel official has been
asked to recommend cuts in the number of military officers needed
in the coming years, the Department of Defense said Tuesday.
   Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood asked Christopher Jehn
to coordinate the study in anticipation of a ``smaller force
structure in light of changing world conditions and declining
budgets,'' the department said in a statement.
   The study will look at the number of officers expected to
graduate through 1997 from military service academies, reserve
officer training corps, officer candidate schools and other
programs.
   Jehn will coordinate the study with the secretaries of the
various military departments and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   The report, the statement said, should include recommendations
on ``appropriate reductions'' in the officer corps for fiscal years
1991 through 1997.
   Atwood said in his memo that the Defense Department must manage
its reduction ``to ensure that the Department maintains the
military capabilities it needs to defend the nation and protect
American interests around the globe.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's proposed 1991 budget has called
for reducing the armed forces by about 38,000 men and women.

   The White House on Tuesday brushed aside a
report linking the CIA to the 1962 arrest of anti-apartheid leader
Nelson Mandela, saying there was ``no value in reviewing a
30-year-old history.''
   ``I haven't looked into it yet,'' Bush said in response to
questions about the report, published earlier this week in an
Atlanta newspaper.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, earlier dismissed the report,
saying, ``We just don't comment on these kinds of intelligence
matters and we don't intend to.''
   ``Our attitude toward Mr. Mandela is one of total support and we
want to demonstrate that to him when he comes,'' Fitzwater said.
   Mandela, 71, who heads the African National Congress, will visit
the White House on June 25. He was freed from a South African
prison earlier this year after 27 years.
   In a sometimes testy exchange with reporters, Fitzwater
repeatedly refused to confirm or deny a report in an Atlanta
newspaper earlier this week that the CIA had helped arrange
Mandela's arrest on Aug. 5, 1962.
   Nor would he say whether the administration felt Mandela were
owed an apology.
   ``We welcome Mr. Mandela to this country. The president
personally called him and invited him. We recognize the outstanding
contributions that he has made to the fight against apartheid in
his country and the contributions he has made to fight racism
around the world,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We want his presence here to highlight that fact. We want to
fight apartheid as best we can. And we find no value in reviewing a
30-year-old history in this case.''
   Asked whether Bush, as a former Central Intelligence Agency
director, was concerned about allegations, Fitzwater said: ``I'm
not going to comment on it. I just won't do it.''
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that a senior CIA
official claimed credit for Mandela's capture within hours of his
arrest. The newspaper quoted an unidentified ``intelligence
officer'' as saying that a tip from a paid CIA informant led to
Mandela's arrest.
   Bush was asked whether he would apologize to Mandela.
   ``I don't know what I'll do about that. But I'm very pleased
that he's coming here. I'm very pleased that he is free,'' the
president said. ``I saw a story about that. But ... I cannot attest
to it. I haven't looked into it yet.''
   Asked if turning someone in to another intelligence agency would
have been proper for the CIA, Bush responded, ``I can't comment on
that matter.''
   Fitzwater told reporters: ``Don't beat me up for what the
Kennedy administration did.''
   ``I don't like it when people question our motives in regard to
blacks or Mandela in relation to something the Kennedy
administration did,'' he said.
   John F. Kennedy was president in 1962 when Mandela was arrested.

   Sen. Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, delayed action on the commodities section of
the 1990 farm bill Tuesday after fellow Democrats opposed his
strategy to appease Republicans.
   Meanwhile, the House Agriculture Committee met in closed session
on the conservation section of its farm bill, trying to settle
disputes between environmentalists and farmers.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who led the drafting of the original
Democratic commodities proposals, said the bill Leahy and ranking
Republican Sen. Richard Lugar created for committee markup sounded
more like a Republican bill than a Democratic one.
   ``We're in the majority,'' Kerrey said. ``What we were saying to
the chairman was you should vote the Democratic proposal.''
   The dispute between the Democrats and Leahy became obvious when
a morning session scheduled for a vote was so poorly attended that
Leahy decided to cancel it.
   Leahy said in a statement that he didn't agree with all parts of
the bill he was putting on the table, but that ``it represents the
basis of a bipartisan compromise on commodities.''
   During markup sessions, committee members can radically change
legislation through amendments. But Kerrey said the minority
Republicans should be the ones trying to amend the proposals, not
the Democrats.
   Lugar has threatened to cause trouble for the Democrats on the
floor if the committee doesn't approve a bill that freezes target
prices, loan rates, and acreage reduction levels and omits budget
gimmicks.
   ``I disagree strongly with the loan rate freeze,'' Kerrey said,
adding that there was room for compromise in the other areas.
   Loan rates determine the amount of support the government will
give farmers to assure they have enough money to plant crops.
Kerrey wants government support tied to production costs as a way
of protecting small and medium farms.
   ``Lugar is saying if you don't give me 100 percent, I'm going to
make life miserable,'' Kerrey said.
   ``It's a tough choice for the chairman,'' Lugar said after Leahy
called off the markup session. ``If he goes with the Democrats, he
would have rather creative and vigorous opposition on the floor.''
   Leahy said he wanted to postpone a vote until he corresponded
with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter about a letter Yeutter
sent him Tuesday.
   But Lugar, who had asked Yeutter to write the letter to
articulate the administration's position on the farm bill, said
Leahy was using it as an excuse to delay.

   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan denounced Tuesday the
``tough guy talk'' used by national drug policy director William
Bennett last week in a verbal attack on New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``I have to say that if a year ago I had any reason to suppose
that Dr. Bennett would use his office in this manner, I would have
taken whatever measures necessary to see that he was not confirmed
for it,'' Moynihan, D-N.Y., said in remarks submitted to the
Congressional Record.
   Bennett, in Albany, N.Y., last Thursday to meet with state drug
officials, attacked Cuomo's drug fighting record and challenged the
Democrat to run for president.
   ``Nobody's afraid of this guy,'' Bennett said. ``He's got a
record to run on and the record on drugs, I have to tell you, is
not what it should be.''
   Moynihan expressed surprise Tuesday at Bennett's choice of words.
   ``How does such a man come to refer to the governor of the state
of New York as `this guy'?'' Moynihan asked. ``We recognize the
idiom. It is so-called `tough-guy talk.' It can be learned from
Hollywood movies, also from detective novels.''
   Bennett declined to respond to the ``tough-guy'' remark,
according to spokesman Don Hamilton.
   ``We really don't have a lot to say on this.'' Hamilton said.
``His substantive criticisms have been made before and they've been
responded to before.''
   Last week, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., rushed to defend Cuomo
and strike back at Bennett. He said the drug policy director could
not point to any successful program that has brought the nation
closer to solving its drug problems.
   Rangel is chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics
Abuse and Control.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh will have a
reserved seat at a savings and loan fraud hearing even though he
hasn't responded to an invitation to testify, the chairman of a
House panel said Tuesday.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., said his House Banking subcommittee
on financial institutions had received no reply to a May 25 letter
offering Thornburgh his choice of three hearing dates.
   FBI Director William Webster and Assistant Attorney General
Edward Dennis already have testified about the administration's
efforts to combat financial institution fraud; Thornburgh has not.
   Justice Department spokesman Douglas Tillett said Thornburgh may
have had a conflict with Annunzio's proposed hearing dates. He said
Thornburgh would testify when it is appropriate.
   ``I will not deny the attorney general an opportunity to appear
if he so chooses, even at the last minute,'' Annunzio said. ``There
will be a chair and a nameplate at the witness table'' at the June
28 hearing.
   Congressional Democrats in recent weeks have stepped up their
criticism of the Bush administration, complaining of a backlog of
uninvestigated fraud cases.
   The administration, in turn, has pointed to a growing list of
convictions and its $50 million program to establish fraud task
forces in 27 cities.

<HEAD>Mid-Level Managers Suffer High-Level Depression, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Climbing the corporate ladder can plunge some
people into depression, but an early diagnosis could spare middle
managers a serious case of the office blues, researchers said
Tuesday.
   A study of 1,870 white-collar employees of Westinghouse Electric
Corp. in Monroeville, a Pittsburgh suburb, showed 16.6 percent of
female and 8.6 percent of male managers were clinically depressed
in the year prior to the survey, which was taken in 1987 and 1988.
   The figures exceed the latest depression rate for all Americans,
4.4 percent in 1986, according to the National Institute of Mental
Health.
   ``The bottom line for you is that depression is eminently
treatable,'' said Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of the psychiatry
department at the University of Pittsburgh. The research findings
were presented to about 100 personnel directors, health-insurance
managers and corporate doctors at a conference on mental health.
   Thirty-six percent of female and 23 percent of male Westinghouse
managers qualified as clinically depressed at some point during
their lives, the study said.
   According to the American Psychiatric Association, a person
suffers from major depression when he or she shows at least five of
the following symptoms within a two-week period: irregular sleeping
patterns, irregular eating habits, recurrent thoughts of suicide or
death, depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in daily
activities, significant weight loss or gain, agitated or retarded
movements, feelings of worthlessness or guilt and lack of
concentration.
   At least one of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or loss of
interest or pleasure, the APA says.
   Herbert Freudenberger, a New York City psychologist and
consultant to companies on white-collar stress and depression, said
the Westinghouse study is significant because it marks the first
time a large company allowed such an examination of its workers.
Westinghouse employs about 120,000 people worldwide.
   Mid-level managers often are depressed because they find
themselves trapped between the gripes of their subordinates and
demands of their own bosses, he said.
   ``The first-line managers are the ones who get hell from over
them and hell from under them,'' said Dr. E. Carroll Curtis,
Westinghouse's medical director.
   Pitt and Westinghouse interviewed the managers, most of whom
were white males, under a grant from the National Institute of
Mental Health.
   The most common causes of depression at work were lack of
rewards, a cloudy job future and specific events such as pay cuts
or bad evaluations, the study said.
   The most common cause of depression at home was a spouse with a
history of psychiatric disorders, the study said.
   Mark Kamlet, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University, estimated that depression-related absenteeism, lost
wages, hospital costs, prescriptions and suicides will cost the
U.S. economy $36.9 billion in 1990.
   Researchers said companies could train more executives and
managers to spot depression's symptoms and tactfully address the
illness with employees.
   The Westinghouse study said although depression usually can be
treated without hospitalization, 70 percent of the depressed
managers didn't seek treatment.
   ``It's not preferred procedure for a manager to turn himself in
to any psychologist,'' Kamlet said.
   ``Particularly with males, someone will tell you to buck up and
take a few shots of beer, then you'll be all right,'' said Jim
Jefferson, 43, a Mellon Bank building manager who recently returned
to work after treatment for depression. But, he said, ``It doesn't
work that way.''

   Jury selection ground through a seventh day
Tuesday in Mayor Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial while top
Barry aides said anew that he would announce he was abandoning his
re-election plans.
   ``He will do it, but the only question left is when,'' said one
top Barry adviser, speaking only on condition of anonymity. ``We're
all just waiting.''
   The mayor was meeting with his staff late Tuesday, but city
officials said they expected only a routine discussion of city
affairs.
   Barry told his top advisers and fund-raisers at a meeting Sunday
that he would give up his plans for a fourth, four-year term.
Several aides said the mayor was making that move in hopes of
restarting stalled plea bargain talks in his drug case.
   In courtroom proceedings Tuesday, 10 more people were assigned
to a pool of prospective jurors by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson. That brought to 68 the number of people accepted
for the pool from which 12 jurors and six alternates are to be
chosen.
   One woman included in the pool said she attended church three
times a week and that she prayed for Barry.
   She also works in the city Department of Human Services, but
said she didn't know any of the more than 50 potential witnesses in
the case. Those on the list include David Rivers, the former human
services department chief who is now on trial for alleged bribery
and conspiracy in connection with city contracts. The judge said he
was unable to conclude the woman was lying. He said also that her
prayers for the defendant were not inconsistent with her assurances
that she could be a fair and impartial juror.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
   The judge has said he expects jury selection, which began June
4, to continue through this week.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved to hold together a
splintering Soviet Union on Tuesday by proposing the 15 republics
agree on a new, looser federation of sovereign states, officials
said.
   The presidents of Lithuania and Latvia emerged smiling from two
meetings with Gorbachev and indicated it could be the beginning of
a solution to the country's problems with its restive republics.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis hinted Gorbachev might
soon end the economic embargo against his republic, which declared
independence from the Soviet Union on March 11.
   By redefining the Soviet federation, Gorbachev could deal with
the three Baltic republics' demands for independence as well as
lesser separatist moves across the vast country.
   On Tuesday, those problems heightened when Russia's parliament,
led by Gorbachev rival Boris Yeltsin, approved a resolution
declaring its laws supercede the national ones. This could
drmatically reduce Gorbachev's authority because the Russian
republic includes 52 percent of the Soviet Union's population and
three-quarters of its land mass.
   Latvia came away from Tuesday's meetings in the Kremlin with an
offer from the Soviet president on starting negotiations toward
independence, according to Latvian President Anatoly Gorbunov.
   At a Moscow press conference with Gorbunov, Landsbergis implied
that Gorbachev also offered his republic a compromise on
independence. But he refused to elaborate, saying he would tell the
people of Lithuania first.
   Asked if Gorbachev would end his embargo of Lithuania, which has
put 26,000 people out of work, Landsbergis replied, ``The blockade
will not be canceled tomorrow, but the day after tomorrow, we shall
see.''
   Gorbachev ordered the blockade of oil, most natural gas and
other raw materials to Lithuania on April 18 because it declared
independence. Latvia and Estonia, the other Baltic republics, have
proceded with slower transition periods toward independence, which
they lost when annexed in 1940.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel said on republic radio Tuesday
night that Gorbachev had recognized the need for talks and a
transition period toward independence, Neme Brus of Estonian Radio
said without elaboration.
   The Russian parliament approved its resolution declaring
sovereignty by a 907-13 vote. The statement was weaker than
originally proposed, however, because it says sovereignty and
priority of its laws over national ones will be worked out in a new
Russian constitution and a new union.
   Gorbachev told the presidents of all 15 Soviet republics in a
separate meeting Tuesday to nominate representatives and prepare
drafts for a union ``that would have elements of a federation, a
confederation or some such pluralistic relationship,'' said
Landsbergis.
   He said Lithuania would consider this.
   Earlier Tuesday, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet legislature
``if Lithuania will suspend the implementation of this act of
independence, we may start to talk. That means suspend its
implementation at least for the duration of the talks.''
   The Baltic officials met with Gorbachev after participating in
Tuesday's meeting of Gorbachev's advisory Federation Council, where
he offered ideas for a new type of Soviet Union ``as a union of
sovereign states,'' Landsbergis said.
   The official Tass news agency said the Federation Council
considered ``the urgent need to work out and conclude a new union
treaty, which will guarantee the actual economic and political
sovereignty of the union republics and their effective
interaction.''
   It continued by saying this would lead to a ``union of sovereign
socialist republics,'' adding the word ``socialist'' not mentioned
by Landsbergis.
   The Baltic republics have dropped the words ``Soviet Socialist''
from their names.
   Soviet television showed Gorbachev telling the Federation
Council it was time to find practical ways to realize ``the key
idea of the deep revamping of our federation.''
   The news announcer said the Soviet Union's planned move to a
market economy to help end widespread shortages and productivity
problems should create mutually profitable relations between the
republics and would help bind them together.
   Gorbachev has pledged repeatedly since fall to work out a new
union treaty but this is the first sign of action.
   Gorbachev offered Latvia ``immediate concrete negotiations'' on
that republic's legal status during its transition period to
independence if it freezes its declaration for the duration of the
negotiations, Gorbunov said.
   Gorbunov suggested that during the transition period, Latvia's
parliament would be considered sovereign. In addition, conflicts
during this period over such issues as the conscription of Latvians
into the Soviet Army would be decided in separate agreements ``on
the basis of equality.''
   He said the Latvian parliament will consider Gorbachev's offer
on Wednesday.
   The Federation Council meeting also brought Gorbachev
face-to-face with Yeltsin for the first time since his rival and
former protege was elected president of Russia over Gorbachev's
opposition.
   Gorbunov said the two men both offered constructive suggestions
and treated each other with respect.
   Earlier in the day, Gorbachev, speaking to the Supreme Soviet
pariament about his Washington summit, acknowledged that some
Americans opposed Senate ratification of a U.S.-Soviet trade
agreement signed during the summit ``until Moscow grants
independence to the group of Lithuanian separatists.''
   ``But after I had contacts with the American people, it turned
out that such demands do not reflect the position of the entire
United States,'' Gorbachev told parliament.
   During an hour-long address, and another hour of answers to
written questions, Gorbachev did not mention that President Bush
said he would not implement the trade deal until the Soviet
parliament approves a draft law guaranteeing free emigration.
   Although Soviet Jews and other ethnic groups are leaving in
record numbers, the parliament last week adopted an agenda that
delays the emigration law until at least September. The parliament
already has given the law preliminary approval.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev shifted gears on
Tuesday and suggested a united Germany could be an associate member
of NATO if the Western alliance switches from its Cold War position
against the Soviet Union.
   Western diplomats said Gorbachev appeared to be showing more
flexibility on the German issue only days after he had again
expressed Soviet opposition to NATO membership during the visit of
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The president also told the Supreme Soviet legislature in his
hourlong speech, broadcast live on Soviet TV, that ``huge results''
were achieved in arms control at his May 30-June 3 summit in
Washington with President Bush.
   The address gave Gorbachev the opportunity to highlight his area
of greatest success, foreign policy, as his domestic policy _
plagued by economic woes, ethnic strife and secessionist strains _
draws increasing fire at home. Gorbachev, smiling often and
speaking calmly, told the legislators his warm reception in the
United States and the signing of a U.S.-Soviet trade agreement
showed U.S. faith in his domestic reform program.
   He reported on his talks with Bush on a united Germany joining
the North Atlantic Treat Organization. West Germany now belongs to
the Western military alliance and East Germany to the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   Gorbachev said, ``Our position is thus: We could agree to the
joining, if you accept associative participation, the principle of
blocs coming together in conjunction with the unification of
Germany in the process of which mutual obligations are not changed,
neither from the side of West or East Germany, and if
simultaneously the blocs are reformed in natural connection with
Vienna and the all-European process.''
   He did not spell out what associate membership for Germany would
comprise. Vienna is the venue for arms reduction talks and the
Europe-wide Conference on Security and Cooperation aimed at
reducing tensions.
   Later, official Radio Moscow said: ``It might be possible to
agree with Germany being in NATO as an associated member provided
there are changes in the nature of the military alliances, both
NATO and the Warsaw Treaty organization.''
   The Kremlin up to now has sought membership in both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact for a united Germany.
   Bush said in Washington that ``a unified Germany should be in
NATO with no conditions,'' but said he was prepared to listen and
discuss ``without rancor'' any ideas the Soviets have on the issue.
He spoke in reply to reporters' questions about Gorbachev's speech.
   The Soviet president seemed to be demanding that a united
Germany fulfill East Germany's obligations to the Warsaw Pact only
during a transition period.
   His comments appeared to signal ``positive movement'' on the
German issue, said one Western diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The West German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Monday that
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East Germany would carry a new
Gorbachev proposal to break the deadlock to a meeting with Bush. It
said Gorbachev would agree to NATO membership for a united Germany
if the Western alliance made ``a clear decision to transform itself
into a political alliance.''
   Gorbachev said Tuesday of the summit: ``As a whole, I think huge
results were achieved in Washington toward limiting nuclear and
conventional weapons.''
   ``All this has great meaning. Another practical step was taken
to realize the idea of a non-violent, non-nuclear world.''
   He said hard work lies ahead, but the Cold War danger has begun
to recede.
   Gorbachev and Bush signed agreements to eliminate the two sides'
chemical weapons and to reach a final accord this year to cut
deeply their strategic nuclear weapons.

<HEAD>Balaguer Wins Election; Formal Proclamation Pending</HEAD>

   President Joaquin
Balaguer made it just another day at the office Tuesday, without
acknowledging that official results indicated he narrowly won a
sixth term as president.
   No rallies were held and no victory speeches were made following
Monday's declaration by the Central Electoral Board that the
83-year-old, blind Balaguer had defeated 80-year-old leftist
challenger Juan Bosch by a margin of fewer than 25,000 votes in the
May 16 election.
   A review of balloting results caused the almost monthlong delay
in concluding the election results.
   The board reported Balaguer had received 678,268 votes, or 35.7
percent, to 653,423, or 34.4 percent, for Bosch.
   Under Dominican law, Balaguer will not be proclaimed
president-elect until the board rules on all vote challenges, a
process that took almost two months in the last four elections.
Inauguration for a four-year term is set for Aug. 16.
   Two opposition parties filed formal challenges with the board
Tuesday, charging irregularities and fraud in the electoral
process. Such challenges are routine in the Dominican Republic, but
are generally regarded as a technicality and rarely result in
significant changes in the results.
   Bosch's Dominican Liberation Party called a meeting for
Wednesday evening to determine its course of action.
   Thousands of candles twinkled in working-class neighborhoods in
a symbol of protest after the board's figures were announced on
television. Police arrested 140 people for disturbing the peace by
lighting candles or chanting anti-Balaguer slogans, but most
detainees were quickly released.
   The electoral board said 40.8 percent of the 3.2 million
registered voters stayed home on election day, the highest
abstention figure in any election since dictator Gen. Rafael
Leonidas Trujillo was assassinated in 1961.
   Bosch, a former president, was overthrown by a military coup in
1963.
   Balaguer was a figuerhead president during the 31-year Trujillo
dictatorship. He was first elected president in 1966 and served
three consecutive terms before losing in 1978. He was re-elected in
1986.
   He appeared to be in trouble before the election because of this
Caribbean island country's economic crisis, frequent electricity
blackouts and water shortages. Opinion polls had Bosch leading by
up to 10 points.
   Bosch is a Marxist, but says he is not a communist and
recognizes capitalism as necessary for reviving the Dominican
economy.

   At least half of Algeria's voters
apparently heeded an election boycott call Tuesday as the ruling
party battled Islamic fundamentalists in the first contested ballot
since French rule ended in 1962, observers said.
   A majority of district races appeared dominated by the National
Liberation Front, the nation's sole political party until last
year's constitutional reforms.
   The fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front, the only other major
party on the ballot, benefitted by the withdrawal of several groups
that urged a boycott.
   Official results were expected Wednesday.
   Boycott leaders claimed the election was rigged in favor of the
ruling party because it controls nearly all the media, has greater
resources than other parties and has its functionaries in local
government offices where the votes will be counted.
   Charges of vote-rigging surfaced immediately after the polls
closed at 7 p.m.
   The Interior Ministry said 55 percent of the 13 million eligible
voters went to the polls. But figures showed a considerable range,
from 73 percent in the town of El-Tarf to 16 percent in the Berber
town of Tizi-Ouzou.
   Fifteen thousand seats were contested in this North African
nation's 1,541 municipal councils and 48 provinces. In all, 11
parties were on the ballot.
   Hocine Ait Ahmed, leader of the opposition Berber movement, the
Front of Socialist Forces, and former President Ahmed Ben Bella's
Movement for Democracy in Algeria led the boycott effort.
   Police were deployed throughout the country as the official
media urged Algerians to vote in ``this first test of democracy.''
   Fundamentalist leader Abassi Madani, a philosophy teacher,
predicted several days ago his party would capture 75 percent of
the vote. He challenged the legitimacy of the election in advance
if the result failed to reflect this figure.
   The statement was denounced as a ``trouble-making provocation''
by several hundred fellow university professors and lecturers.
   For months, fundamentalist supporters have been accused of
harrassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in the Algiers
region, prompting denunciations from most political groups.
   In the Algiers suburb of El Harrach, the National Liberation
Front withdrew from the elections, accusing the fundamentalists of
``exercising moral violence against the voters and committing
serious violations against the election law.'' The statement did
not elaborate.
   The official news agency reported several groups of Islamic
supporters tried to overrun some Algiers voting stations, alleging
the vote counting was influenced by the government.
   Numerous voters in the Algiers district were turned away from
polling booths when they appeared without the necessary documents.
Among those blocked were men who tried to exercise their right to
vote on behalf of their wife _ or wives _ without written
authorization.
   The National Liberation Front's was forced to give up its
monopoly on power after soldiers killed scores of people in October
1988 riots sparked by deteriorating economic conditions.
Constitutional changes adopted in February 1989 legalized pluralism.
   The Islamic Salvation Front seeks to establish the Islamic legal
code, the Sharia, as law and openly opposes the democratic process.

   Witnesses told the military court
trial of former Gen. Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu on Tuesday that he
did not shoot at protesters seeking the overthrow of his Communist
dictator brother.
   Ceausescu, 66, former commander of the secret police, was put on
trial in late March on a charge of ``inciting genocide'' during
attempts to quell the popular revolution that ended Nicolae
Ceausescu's 24 years in power.
   The dictator was executed by firing squad on Christmas Day.
   His brother was accused in the indictment of ordering his cadets
to fire at demonstrators and of killing seven people himself.
   Earlier witnesses swore they saw him approach the crowd with his
gun on Dec. 21, and fire.
   On Tuesday, however, Stefan Antohie, an officer of the secret
police securitate, told the panel of three military judges that he
heard warning salvos, but ``Ceausescu did not shoot ... and I did
not hear him ordering fire.''
   Antohie said he saw Ceausescu several times during Dec. 21, near
the scene of the alleged shooting.
   Securitate officer Cornel Manescu, 33, on duty at the police
academy on Dec. 21, said he heard no one at the time saying
Ceausescu fired at demonstrators.
   An official death toll lists at least 1,033 people as being
killed in the December revolution.
   Judge Adrian Nitoiu told a reporter Wednesday's session ``will
be important, the prosecutor might change the charge'' to a lesser
one, but offered no details. Nitoiu said the trial will end and a
verdict and sentence will be pronounced in ``a couple of days.''

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met
Tuesday with two Swedish ministers for talks on international
terrorism and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Thornburgh, who arrived from Scotland, met with Swedish Justice
Minister Laila Freivalds and the interior minister, Bengt
Johansson, the local TT news agency reported.
   Goran Regner, head of the legal division of the Ministry of
Justice, told TT that Thornburgh and Freivalds discussed the
bombing of the Pan Am flight and also ways to fight international
terrorism and drug trafficking. There were no further details.
   Two hundred seventy people in the air and on the ground were
killed when a bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish
town of Lockerbie in December 1988.
   Swedish police have supplied their Scottish counterparts with
information concerning two Palestinians suspected in the bombing.
   The two Arabs, Mohammed Abu Talb and Marten Imandi, both
received life terms in late 1989 for separate bombings in Denmark
and the Netherlands in 1985 and 1986.
   After the meeting Thornburgh departed for Italy. He will later
travel to Ireland for a meeting with ministers from the European
Economic Community to discuss methods of fighting international
terrorism.

<HEAD>Oil Spill Conferees Stuck on Liability, Hulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress has been unable to agree on
comprehensive oil spill legislation over provisions on ship
construction and liability, two problems exemplified in the wreck
of a Norwegian supertanker, officials said Tuesday.
   Since 1975, Congress has struggled to create a liability and
response law that covers the estimated 8,000 oil spills that occur
in the United States annually.
   Galvanized by the Exxon Valdez accident, both the House and
Senate last fall passed sweeping legislation. But the approximately
100 members of a House-Senate conference committee have met only
once to resolve differences in the bills.
   Last weekend, the supertanker Mega Borg caught fire 57 miles
from Galveston and since then firefighters have struggled to bring
the fire under control.
   The fire prompted members of Congress on Tuesday in calling for
conferees to step up the pace.
   ``Once again, the need to prevent these spills is made all too
clear,'' said Sen. Brock Adams.
   The bill creates a $1 billion cleanup fund through a 5-cent tax
on each barrel of oil created in or imported to the United States.
It also establishes Coast Guard oil spill response centers along
U.S. coasts.
   But the House and Senate disagree on requiring supertankers to
have double hulls and using international protocol to guide
liability in a spill.
   Congressional staff members say conferees are close to resolving
the double hull issue. But international protocol and its
relationship to state liability laws has tripped up oil spill
legislation for the past seven Congresses, officials say.
   Senators, led by Majority Leader George Mitchell, say liability
limits set by international protocol aren't strict enough.
   ``They see it rightly as a back door attempt to pre-empt state
laws,'' said Mike Matz of the Sierra Club. Nineteen states require
unlimited liability for the oil companies or carriers to clean up
damage to the environment.
   International protocols provide up to $260 million from an
international compensation fund before any U.S. dollars are spent
on an cleanup, say House backers.
   And they must be in place for the United States to hold foreign
vessels liable for spills that could affect U.S. water, they say.
   Currently, the Norwegian owners of the Mega Borg could walk away
from liability for damage the wreck causes the U.S. shoreline
because the fire occurred in international waters.
   ``We're living on the good graces of the Norwegians right now,''
said Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., a House conferee and proponent of
the international protocol. ``I hope this incident drives the
Senate to reconsider.''
   But Mitchell said full compensation for catastrophic spills
cannot be obtained from international protocol limits.
   He said the House version, for instance, would have limited
Exxon's liability for last year's Alaskan spill to less than $60
million. Damage from the Valdez spill is estimated to be more than
$2 billion, said Mitchell, D-Maine.
   ``Exxon's victims could not have obtained more than $260 million
from the international regime and $1 billion from the federal trust
fund, if this bill had been enacted,'' Mitchell said of the House
version.
   But Rep. Jack Fields, who flew over the Mega Borg fire Monday,
said the accident ``clearly begs for acceptance of international
protocols.''
   ``States like Maine want to punish the shippers,'' said Fields,
R-Texas. ``They want to be able to squeeze as much blood from the
turnip as possible rather than make those who have been damaged
whole.''
   The House bill requires new oil tankers to have double hulls and
existing tankers to be retrofitted in 15 years. The Senate
recommends study of ``double hulls or better'' means to prevent oil
spills.

   A former FBI agent who solved a year-old
homicide by confessing to the crime pleaded guilty Tuesday to
strangling a pregnant informant with whom he'd been having an
affair. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.
   In a signed confession, Mark Putnam said he choked Susan Daniels
Smith, 27, on June 8, 1989, ``in an act of extreme rage'' while the
couple arued over support of her expected child.
   Putnam, 30, of Sunrise, Fla., entered a guilty plea to one count
of felony manslaughter in Ms. Smith's death.
   Immediately after the hearing, Putnam was handcuffed and taken
into custody by Kentucky State Police officers.
   It was apparently the first case in FBI history in which an
agent had been charged with a homicide, said Terry O'Connor, the
FBI's top agent in Kentucky.
   ``As far as the FBI is concerned, this is a difficult day ...
but I would hope that our entire record ... is what's going to
govern the way that people think about the FBI,'' O'Connor said.
   The victim's family expressed outrage they were not consulted in
the drafting of Putnam's plea bargain. They had wanted him to stand
trial for murder.
   The victim's sister, Shelby Ward of Freeburn, was cited for
trying to conceal a .38-caliber handgun in the courtroom by
Kentucky State Police, and was released.
   Putnam appeared tense during his 20-minute appearance in Pike
County Circuit Court.
   Putnam, who resigned Friday, worked in Pikeville for about two
years until his transfer to Miami in May 1989. He used Ms. Smith as
an informant in a bank robbery and car theft case.
   Putnam's confession was attached to an indictment returned
Tuesday by the Pike County grand jury. In the statement, he
recalled a bitter, violent argument with Ms. Smith about her
pregnancy. Putnam had returned to Pikeville for several days to
work a car theft case he had investigated.
   Ms. Smith ``kept telling me the baby was mine and that she was
going to `hang me' over this. She said she would tell the FBI, my
family and the newspapers,'' Putnam's statement said.
   The couple was driving on a rural eastern Kentucky highway at
the time and pulled off the road at Peter Creek Mountain. Putnam
said he and his wife would adopt the child but Ms. Smith refused,
and began slapping Putnam.
   The agent recalled that ``in an act of extreme rage ... I
started choking her and telling her to shut up.'' Putnam said he
tried in vain to revive her.
   He said he placed the body in the trunk of his rented car and
dumped it the following evening off an old coal mine road about
nine miles north of Pikeville.
   Prosecutor John Paul Runyon, the Pike County commonwealth's
attorney, said that without Putnam's June 4 confession, ``we had
absolutely no evidence. Not one scintilla or shred of evidence to
bring a charge or convict this man.''
   ``In the 28 years that I have been a prosecutor, this is the
first experience that I have had where a lawyer called me on a
telephone and said I have a man who wants to confess to murder, or
homicide, and wants to go to the penitentiary, and we had
absolutely no evidence,'' Runyon added.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger has brought ``dishonor
and disrepute'' on the Senate and should be denounced by his
colleagues for engaging in unethical conduct, the Senate Ethics
Committee's special counsel recommended Tuesday.
   Robert S. Bennett's recommendation was a surprise on the opening
day of the panel's hearings into Durenberger's alleged financial
improprieties. Bennett called the Minnesota Republican's conduct
``reprehensible.''
   Durenberger, in a written statement, said ``the sanction of
denouncement ... is harsher than warranted.'' The senator, who
appeared stunned as Bennett made his recommendation, later admitted
in a written statement that he had made ``mistakes and even some
violations of rules,'' and his lawyer conceded some penalty was
appropriate. But Durenberger contended his actions ``were taken in
good faith.''
   Bennett said the evidence showed a ``pattern of unethical
conduct'' by Durenberger in a book-promotion deal, transactions
involving his Minneapolis condominium and his acceptance of free
limousine rides.
   ``Your loyalty here is not to Sen. Durenberger,'' Bennett told
the committee.
   Durenberger sat with his hand on his cheek as Bennett pointed
out to the six-member committee that they sat under a Senate seal.
   ``Sen. Durenberger has tarnished that seal and has brought this
institution to dishonor and disrepute,'' the counsel said. ``Your
loyalty to this institution now summons you to denounce this
senator and his actions.''
   Only the full Senate can decide to punish a member. If the
chamber eventually followed the counsel's recommendation, it would
pass a resolution denouncing Durenberger's conduct _ an action that
would have greater consequences for the senator politically than
for his position as a senator, which would not be affected.
   Bennett reminded the panel it could consider stripping
Durenberger of his seniority and committee assignments, as well as
ordering restitution. But he did not recommend such actions.
   He also said the most serious punishment, expulsion, has been
reserved for senators who violate the law and shouldn't apply in
this case.
   Durenberger's lawyer, Jim Hamilton, told the hearing:
   ``What we have is mistakes and sloppiness. Sanction such as
denouncement is simply not appropriate.''
   He told the committee that Durenberger ``relied on a bevy of
lawyers'' in all his financial transactions and there were no
``venal motives'' or a ``grand conspiracy'' to violate the rules.
   ``Senator Durenberger feels that some sanction is appropriate
because he was inattentive and unwise,'' Hamilton said, but the
attorney did not specify any punishment. The lowest form of
punishment would be a mild letter of rebuke.
   Bennett, who earlier told the committee that Durenberger
exhibited ``very serious insensitivity to the ethical demands of
his office,'' told senators they should ``denounce Sen. Durenberger
publicly for knowingly engaging in unethical conduct which has
brought dishonor and disrepute to this institution.''
   The hearing took on the aura of a trial as the 12-year senator
stared from across the room when Bennett, standing at a lectern,
accused Durenberger of making fake promotional appearances in 1985
and 1986 for his two books.
   The speeches were really ``a gimmick'' to ``magically'' turn
honoraria earned from appearances before trade groups into book
promotions, allowing Durenberger to make $100,000 beyond his Senate
salary and exceed the chamber's speaking-fee limits, Bennett said.
   The scheme was concocted, Bennett said, as the senator neared
the legal maximum for honoraria.
   Bennett said Durenberger's attempts to change ownership of his
Minneapolis condominium was a scheme to improperly collect $40,055
in Senate travel reimbursements from 1983 through 1989. He would
not have been eligible for the payments if he had owned the
residence outright, Bennett said.
   ``The senator consistently engaged in a pattern of unethical
conduct and showed very serious insensitivity to the ethical
demands of his office,'' Bennett told the six-member committee.
   About 200 spectators attended the first of the hearings, which
the committee will use to determine if Durenberger broke the
chamber's rules and federal law.
   The panel has found ``substantial credible evidence'' that
Durenberger may have committed violations in the condominium deal,
the book arrangement and the limousine trips.
   If the panel finds wrongdoing, it can recommend that the Senate
punish Durenberger by handing out anything from a mild rebuke to
expulsion _ although the latter is unlikely.
   In his book deal, Durenberger received $100,000 from a
Minneapolis publisher, Piranha Press, in return for addressing
trade groups that sent their speaking fees to Piranha.
   Durenberger contended the speeches were made to promote books,
but Bennett said the real purpose was for the senator to collect
honoraria in excess of Senate limits: $22,530 in 1985 and $30,040
in 1986.
   ``This very hungry fish, Piranha Press, was allowed to engage in
a feeding frenzy'' to make money, Bennett said. Durenberger, he
added, ``allowed himself and his office to be used as the bait and
he got $100,000 for his trouble.''
   The scheme made a large profit for Piranha, which earned
$248,360 from Durenberger's speeches and only $15,560 from the sale
of books.
   In calling the book arrangement a scam, Bennett told the
committee that in the 113 appearances being investigated, the host
groups thought they were hearing a typical honoraria speech. Some
of the groups ``strenuously'' objected when they learned
Durenberger's speech was classified as a book promotion and
withdrew the invitation.
   In addition, Bennett said, the two books Durenberger wrote on
national security and health issues were displayed at only three of
the 113 appearances. At one appearance, Durenberger commented,
``This is a book, but what it really is is 44 speeches'' compiled
into a book.
   In describing the complicated condominium deal, Bennett said
Durenberger wouldn't have been able to collect Senate travel
reimbursements if he had owned the residence.
   So Durenberger schemed not once, but twice, to have business
partnerships take ownership and lease the condominium back to him
when he stayed there _ thus allowing Senate travel expenses to be
paid.
   When the original partner decided to end the initial partnership
in 1987, four years after it was formed, Durenberger entered into a
similar arrangement year with his former campaign manager.
   Bennett also said Durenberger showed a ``pattern of
insensitivity'' when he accepted free limousine rides on 21
occasions in 1985 and 1986 from groups and individuals interested
in legislation.
   Durenberger has said the rides were to his marriage counselor
and were arranged in conjunction with official appearances.
   A senator could accept only up to $100 in gifts from those with
an interest in legislation, Bennett said. The limousine rides were
valued at $4,935.

   Crews from a company named OOPS brought
in equipment from all over to be ready to collect and contain oil
from the crippled supertanker Mega Borg once the flames on board
were smothered.
   ``I'm confident that we've got the pieces (of equipment) that we
need here now. And I'm confident that we've explored where we can
get other pieces, if needed,'' Jim O'Brien, president of OOPS Inc.,
said Tuesday. OOPS stands for O'Brien's Oil Pollution Services of
Gretna, La.
   OOPS was hired by Elf, a Houston subsidiary of the French oil
distribution company whose oil the Mega Borg was carrying.
   O'Brien was the technical adviser on the cleanup of the Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska.
   OOPS has brought in booms, skimmers and water separators from
the Gulf Coast and California. Other equipment was to arrive within
24 hours from the Northeast.
   O'Brien said his company has no equipment of its own.
   Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said Tuesday that although the
tanker fire had eased, ``we're still not completely safe from a
major release'' of oil.
   But he added that there ``is not a great chance'' of any oil
coming ashore because the light African crude is likely to break up
and evaporate.
   O'Brien said his company had enough equipment to handle a major
spill.
   OOPS' first priority will be to right the 886-foot ship to
prevent further spillage. Crews then will begin transferring oil to
smaller ships and pumping water into the Mega Borg's emptying cargo
tanks to keep her steady.
   The Coast Guard on Tuesday revised its estimate of the amount of
oil on the water to less than 2,000 gallons, a fraction of the
100,000 gallons estimated earlier. Much oil had either burned off
or evaporated, officials said.
   The length of the slick on the water continued to shrink,
officials said.
   The amount that spilled from the Norwegian tanker, which was
carrying 38 million gallons, was not determined.
   The rear of the Mega Borg dropped more than 60 feet since the
tanker caught fire early Saturday while transferring cargo to a
smaller vessel. Two of the 41 crewmen died, two were missing and
presumed dead and 17 were injured, none seriously.
   Airplane crews have sprayed dispersants to break up the heavier
oil patches and remained ready to spray more if needed, Greene said.

   City police warned record stores Tuesday to
stop selling the controversial album ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be''
by rap group 2 Live Crew or face possible obscenity charges.
   ``There's no prior restraint. We're just asking for voluntary
compliance,'' said Lt. Jerry Pittman, commander of the vice squad.
   In about five days, police will begin conducting undercover
investigations and arresting anyone still selling the album,
Pittman said.
   ``Unfortunately, when something like that occurs, the clerk that
sells the record is often the one that gets arrested,'' he said.
``I don't think the business owners want that.''
   Pittman said Bexar County Assistant District Attorney Mike
Schill reviewed transcripts of the album lyrics and listened to
them on tape before determining that some words violate state
obscenity law.
   However, Schill, reached later by telephone, would say only that
the lyrics in question could violate state obscenity law.
   ``I have my opinion, but my opinion doesn't count,'' Schill
said. ``It's what the jury or the judge think.'' Schill said his
role would be to decide whether to prosecute a case if police bring
him one.
   But, he added, ``I think the federal judge in Florida was
correct _ which was that it's obscene.''
   In Florida last week, U.S. District Judge Jose Gonzalez ruled
material on the album obscene under that state's law. On Sunday,
two 2 Live Crew members were arrested on obscenity charges after
performing the banned lyrics at an adults-only nightclub concert.
Two days earlier, a record-store owner was arrested on an obscenity
charge for selling the album.
   The group's attorney, Bruce Rogow, said he filed an appeal
Monday with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   Pittman said, ``We believe that it is obscene as well in the
state of Texas,'' adding that the album describes ``deviant sexual
intercourse'' and ``is inundated with obscene language.''
   State law requires that someone convicted of selling obscene
material be aware that it is obscene, Pittman said. He said
officers are ``diplomatically'' going to about 84 local stores to
explain what the album contains, and added, ``We're getting
compliance.''
   Sound Warehouse stores in San Antonio removed the records
Tuesday to comply with the law, said branch manager Mark Christy,
who had a note from vice detectives saying the records contain
obscene lyrics.
   ``I'm glad to see that they're doing it,'' Christy said. ``I'm
not one of the people for censorship, but I think this music is
ridiculous.''
   Greta Colvin, manager of a Hasting's Records and Tapes, said
local stores in that chain also are removing the albums, but said
she disagrees with police.
   Ms. Colvin said officers came to her store Tuesday and asked her
to sign a statement that she had been informed the lyrics violate
obscenity laws. She said she told them that Hasting's rates albums
and that any rated ``R'' may not be purchased by people under 18,
but the officers didn't seem to care.
   ``It's censorship,'' she said. ``If someone comes out with
another song that somebody with a political influence finds
offensive, they're going to come around again.''
   Pittman said he'd hoped to keep the police action out of the
limelight at first to avoid publicity-boosted sales.
   The penalty for conviction of selling obscene material in Texas
_ a Class A misdemeanor _ can be up to a year in jail and a $2,000
fine.
   2 Live Crew is to perform in Huntsville, Ala., on Saturday. City
Attorney Clyde Blankenship said some lyrics on the album appear to
violate the local obscenity ordinance, which the City Council on
Monday night expanded to include live performances.
   A local pastor threatened to block off the concert center with
``a human ring'' if the group is allowed to perform. But the
council said it could not block the performance, which the band's
promoter, Eddison Walters, said would be appropriate ``for kids.''

   A woman who committed suicide by running
her car in a closed garage also killed her two roommates,
apparently without intending to, police said Tuesday.
   The body of Ruth M. Goran, 55, was found Friday, two days before
her daughter's wedding. Mrs. Goran was clad in a nightgown, and was
sitting in a car with the ignition on, said Sgt. James Flonacher.
   Inside her condominium, Claude R. Hillhouse, 42, and Gordon
Geer, 32, were also dead. Both men were dressed, with Hillhouse in
the living room and Geer in the bathroom, police said.
   The same carbon monoxide fumes that took Mrs. Goran's life had
seeped into the condominium and killed the men, Flonacher said.
   Police are still unsure why Mrs. Goran would want to kill
herself, but seemed that she did not intend for the two men to die.
   ``There are absolutely no signs of foul play. ... We are
convinced the deaths were accidental,'' Flonacher said.
   The bodies were found when the daughter, Karen McLaughlin, went
to her mother's house Friday and called police when no one answered
the door.
   Mrs. McLaughlin, 29, had come from Las Vegas on Friday to be
married. She married Jon McLaughlin, 33, also of Las Vegas, in a
ceremony Sunday.
   ``We had the wedding because we knew Mom wanted us to,'' Mrs.
McLaughlin said.
   She said she had spoken to her mother earlier in the week.
   ``She wasn't suicidal,'' Mrs. McLaughlin said. ``She was real
happy. We were looking forward to holding the reception at her
home. We were going to bring everything over Friday night.''
   Mrs. McLaughlin said she thought her mother's action was more of
a cry for attention than an actual attempt to commit suicide.
   However, she previously told two detectives she thought her
mother had a history of instability and was capable of killing
herself, Flonacher said.
   Mrs. McLaughlin said Hillhouse was her mother's boyfriend and
that Geer had roomed with Hillhouse before the two moved in with
her mother several months ago.
   Mrs. Goran was widowed, and had moved to Arizona from Michigan.
Friends and neighbors said she had not seemed suicidal.
   ``There was no indication of despondency. All the employees were
very shocked at what happened,'' said Alice Huff, a secretary at
Terrell Battery Corp., where Mrs. Goran worked as a bookkeeper.

<HEAD>Amtrak Authorization Vote Upholds Bush's Veto Streak</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf: ``Sen. Robert,'' with similar bill being
introduced in Senate</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate failed to muster a two-thirds
majority Tuesday to override President Bush's veto of legislation
providing federal support for the Amtrak passenger rail network.
   The action kept Bush's his streak of successful vetoes intact at
11.
   The 64-36 vote to override on Bush's 66th birthday was three
votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed. Bush had vetoed the
measure last month because he objected to a requirement tightening
regulation of freight railroad ownership, and the House voted last
week to override him.
   Republicans maintained that Bush otherwise supported the $2
billion Amtrak authorization provisions even though his and the
Reagan administration before him have routinely proposed an end to
federal subsidies for rail passenger service.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, voted to
sustain the veto in a parliamentary move aimed at giving Democrats
another shot at overriding the president. Only a member of the
winning side may ask that a vote be reconsidered, and Mitchell
promptly did so, giving the Democrats time to try to switch votes.
Another vote was not immediately scheduled.
   The other 54 Democrats in the Senate voted for the override.
They were joined by 10 of the 45 Republicans.
   The vote ``shows that we obviously had the strength,'' said
White House spokesman Steve Hart. Earlier, White House officials
had predicted a close vote.
   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., noted that a bill without the
objectionable part has already been introduced in the House and
later, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., introduced a similar bill in the
Senate.
   ``The fight is not over the funding of Amtrak,'' said Kasten,
who lead the Republican debate. Hart at the White House added, ``If
they send us the bill without the ICC provision, he'll sign it.''
   It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to
Congress last year. None of them had been overridden.
   The bill authorizes government subsidies for the passenger rail
system for three years. It also includes a provision that allows
planning for a commuter line between Washington, D.C., and northern
Virginia suburbs.
   Bush vetoed the bill May 24 over a requirement that the
Interstate Commerce Commission, which regulates railroads, must
approve any acquisition of a major freight line by a company not in
the railroad business. The commission already must approve the
acquisition of one railroad by another.
   Bush called it ``an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the
financial restructuring of the railroad industry.''
   But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and other Midwestern lawmakers said
that without closing that regulatory loophole, thousands of miles
of track could be ripped up and be sold off to repay the debt
incurred in a buyout.
   ``The president's veto is wrong in terms of passenger traffic in
this nation,'' Simon said. ``It is infinitely wrong in terms of the
ICC approval.''
   ``What we want to avoid is a situation where people come in and
buy the railroad and then just dismember it,'' he said.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., argued that Republicans should put
national interest over concerns with a favor for Bush.
   ``I hope that we can get back not to what's nice for the party,
but what is right for America,'' he said. ``Overriding this veto is
certainly right for America and its transportation needs.''
   In the House vote last week, 58 Republicans joined 236 Democrats
for the override. The vote against was 123. It was the first
successful override vote in either chamber in the Bush
administration. However, a successful override requires a
two-thirds majority in both chambers.

   Israeli troops pursuing Palestinian
stone-throwers fired tear gas into a U.N. clinic in Gaza City on
Tuesday, and 66 infants and toddlers were treated for inhaling the
fumes, the army said.
   In Jerusalem, a 17-year-old Jewish seminary student going to
prayers at the Western Wall was stabbed twice in the stomach. He
was reported in fair condition at a Jerusalem hospital.
   Police immediately rounded up 100 Palestinians for questioning.
   Meanwhile, the army demolished the homes of three Palestinian
families and sealed three others in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. Members of the families were accused of throwing firebombs
or killing Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israel, the army
said.
   The house demolitions came on the first working day of Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir's new right-wing government, which has
pledged to ``uproot'' the 30-month-old Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.
   Since the rebellion against the Israeli occupation began in
December 1987, 717 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians.
   An additional 221 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities.
Forty-five Israelis have died in the violence.
   An army official said the tear gas was fired into the U.N.'s
Rimal Health Center in Gaza after an army patrol came under a
barrage of stones and blocks. He said the rocks were thrown from
the clinic compound.
   The official said on condition of anonymity that soldiers are
barred from firing tear gas into enclosed spaces. He said troops
involved in Tuesday's incident would be punished.
   Late Tuesday, a local military commander sentenced a reserve
captain to 10 days of hard labor for the incident, an army
spokesman said.
   Officials of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which runs the
clinic, said the incident began when about six Israelis in civilian
clothes ran into the building, apparently in pursuit of Palestinian
boys who had stoned their car.
   When army jeeps pulled up outside, they came under a hail of
stones, the officials said.
   Dr. Zihni Wahidi, director of the clinic, said there were about
200 pregnant women and babies inside the building when the tear gas
was fired.
   He said many babies were overcome by gas. ``Most were treated at
the clinic, and some were taken to Nasser Hospital,'' he said.
   The army said 66 children were affected by the tear gas, and
doctors at nearby Nasser Hospital said they treated 58 youngsters
between the ages of 1 month and 3 years. They said 16 of those were
admitted.
   A U.N. relief agency spokesman, Rolf van Oye, said a complaint
would be filed with the Israeli military government.
   The victim in the stabbing in Jerusalem's Old City was
identified as Yosef Edri, 17. In an interview on Israel radio, Edri
said his assailant carried ``a big sword and a pocket knife'' and
stabbed him with both.
   After the stabbing, police forced scores of Arab-owned shops to
close.
   The Western Wall, where Edri was going to pray, is the remnant
of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. and
is regarded as Judaism's holiest site.
   The Palestinian homes that were demolished were in the village
of Yatta and the Jalazoun refugee camp in the West Bank and the
Khan Yunis refugee camp in Gaza, the army said. Those sealed were
all in the West Bank, it said.
   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied
Territories said a total of 293 Palestinian houses have been
destroyed and 173 sealed for security offenses since the uprising
began.
   The U.S. government and human rights groups have opposed house
demolitions and sealings, saying they constitute collective
punishment.

   Sunny skies Tuesday raised hopes that patch-up
work might begin on the cruise liner Bermuda Star's torn hull, but
choppy seas delayed the effort to contain thousands of gallons of
oil within the ship.
   Winds reaching 35 mph whipped up waves around the liner in
Buzzards Bay, prompting divers to suspend their survey of the hull,
the Coast Guard said.
   ``With the waves so high, the diver could be thrown into the
hull,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Tom Blair at the Marine Safety
Office in Providence, R.I.
   ``He has to watch what he's doing very carefully, and he can't
use the video camera, so the whole survey is being slowed up,''
Blair added.
   ``It's nice and sunny out there today, but those winds are still
pretty strong,'' he said. ``It's great weather for sailing but not
for something like this.''
   The Coast Guard said that John Neary, who was piloting the
Bermuda Star when it ran aground Sunday, also had been piloting the
car-transport vessel Hual Ingrita in February when it ran aground
on Jamestown Island, R.I., in Narragansett Bay.
   But the Coast Guard determined that a failed steering mechanism
caused the earlier accident, Cmdr. Larry Doyle, executive officer
of the Marine Safety Office, told a news conference.
   The cause of the Bermuda Star accident remained under
investigation.
   Neary, of the Northeast Pilots Association in Newport, R.I., was
brought aboard the liner to guide it through local waters, the
Coast Guard said.
   Drug tests of Neary, the Bermuda Star's captain and several
other officers were not complete Tuesday.
   Doyle said a container with a urine sample from Neary broke en
route to a Philadelphia laboratory, and that another sample would
be taken Tuesday. He said the delay would not hamper tests for
potential substance abuse because traces remain in the body for
several weeks.
   The Bermuda Star, carrying more than 1,060 passengers and crew,
ran aground in dense fog Sunday morning on a rocky ledge off
Falmouth. The vessel was freed that night, and towed to anchor
about three miles away.
   The accident ripped a 90-by-2-foot hole in the ship's hull,
exposing tanks holding about 110,000 gallons of fuel, the Coast
Guard said.
   About 7,500 gallons spilled, and 500 gallons to 1,000 gallons
washed ashore on Naushon Island at the eastern end of Buzzards Bay.
   Workers began cleaning the oil Tuesday in an effort expected to
take about two weeks. The island, sparsely inhabited at the time,
becomes crowded during the summer.
   No additional oil was leaking from the liner, Doyle said. A
small sheen trailing off the rear of the ship was thought to be oil
clinging to its waterline and would be cleaned when seas calmed, he
said, adding that water pressure should keep more oil from leaking.
   Coast Guard officials decided against unloading the fuel to a
barge before towing the liner to dry dock because of the heavy seas.
   Rear Adm. Richard Rybacki said he was disappointed by how long
it took for the necessary equipment to get to the accident scene.
   ``I would like to have seen a quicker response on Sunday when we
had good weather,'' he said.
   Rybacki said Coast Guard personnel responded as quickly as
possible but that the Coast Guard has only ``first-aid equipment''
and must rely on commercial contractors for help in serious spills.
   Relatively small booms were placed around the Bermuda Star
within two hours of its grounding; larger booms were supplied seven
to eight hours later.

   Imelda Marcos' racketeering trial resumed
Tuesday for the first time since the former first lady of the
Philippines coughed blood in court.
   ``I feel fine,'' Mrs. Marcos said when she arrived at the
courthouse.
   The federal court trial had been in recess since May 31 when
Mrs. Marcos collapsed in the courtroom with a stomach ailment and
was hospitalized for three days.
   As the trial resumed, the U.S. State Department denied that Mrs.
Marcos had been asked to help negotiate military base leases in the
Philippines.
   A New York Post article on May 31 quoted Mrs. Marcos as saying
she was approached in New York by State Department representatives
who suggested a deal in which she could stand trial in her homeland
in return for her assistance in resolving the U.S.-Philippine base
agreement.
   In a letter to the prosecutor's office and made available to
reporters Tuesday, Jamison M. Selby, the department's assistant
legal adviser on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said the report
was ``entirely without foundation.''
   Selby said he spoke with more than a dozen officials who would
have authorized or been aware of such a meeting.
   However, one of Mrs. Marcos' attorneys, Benjamin Cassiday,
insisted that two ``State Department connected'' people did meet
with the former first lady of the Philippines during Memorial Day
weekend.
   Cassiday said he knew their identities but refused to say who
they were, or under what auspices they went to see her at 2 a.m. on
May 25.
   ``It's political and it isn't part of our case,'' he said.
   The leases on Clark Air Force Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in
the Philippines expire Sept. 16, 1991. The United States is seeking
to extend the leases despite opposition in the Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, has been on trial since March 20 on charges of
racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction
of justice.
   She is accused of helping her late husband, ousted Philippine
President Ferdinand E. Marcos, embezzle more than $220 million from
their country's treasury to buy real estate and art in New York.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is charged
with mail fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping
the Marcoses hide their ownership of the real estate.
   The trial resumed without mention of Mrs. Marcos' collapse. The
only indication that she had been ill was an emergency medical kit
next to her personal doctor who was seated behind her.
   Mrs. Marcos also returned to court without a portable monitor
she had previously worn because of a blood pressure condition.
   In testimony, the prosecution called FBI agent Robert Reich to
explain a large chart that outlined the flow of funds from the
Philippines for the purchase of an office building at 200 Madison.
   The building is among four New York properties the government
claims that the Marcoses bought with embezzled money.
   The chart showed that the Glockhurst Corp., a business allegedly
controlled by the Marcoses, bought the building in November 1983
for $50.5 million.
   The prosecution previously showed similar charts for the other
three buildings _ 40 Wall St., the Crown Building and Herald Center.
   The prosecution is expected to complete its case this week.

   Israel on Tuesday invited the U.N.
Secretary-General to send a personal envoy to the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to investigate alleged abuses of Palestinian
human rights.
   The move by Israel's day-old conservative government comes
almost 2 weeks after United Sttes vetoed a United Nations measure
calling for the Security Council to dispatch a team to the occupied
territories.
   The United States vetoed the measure but said it supported a
personal mission sent by the U.N. chief.
   ``The government of Israel, on our own initiative, extends to
the secretary-general an invitation to (Secretariat Director)
Jean-Claude Aime to visit Israel as an envoy in the framework of a
visit to the region,'' Israeli Ambassador Johanan Bein told
reporters.
   He said it was the ``first action of the new Israeli government
in the international arena.'' The hard-line government received
parliamentary approval Monday.
   Bein made the statement after a meeting with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar who had sought to send both Aime and a
special adviser to the occupied territories.
   Bein, Israel's acting permanent representative, said Israel
``definitely will extend full cooperation'' to the U.N. envoy. But
he said the invitation was limited to Aime.
   He did not give a date for the visit, but U.N. officials said it
could take place soon.
   Arab nations demanded emergency action from the United Nations
to protect Palestinians living in the occupied territories after an
apparently deranged Israeli gunned down seven Palestinian laborers
and wounded 11 others on May 20.
   The shooting sparked widespread rioting in the occupied
territories and a crackdown by Israeli troops.
   Israel's invitation may ease diplomatic tensions that emerged
after the U.S. veto.
   Arab nations have threatened to seek an emergency session of the
General Assembly to consider the situation in the territories if no
action was taken by the United Nations.

<HEAD>Environmentalists File Suit To Block Restart Of Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

   Two environmental groups have filed a
lawsuit to prevent the restart of the Savannah River nuclear
weapons plant on the grounds it would violate the federal Clean
Water Act, an attorney said Tuesday.
   The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Columbia
by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Energy Research
Foundation.
   The groups charge that hot water discharges from one of three
reactors scheduled to restart in December would exceed temperature
limits set by the 1972 Clean Water Act.
   The discharges would send scalding water into the small streams
adjacent to the plant, said Jimmy Chandler, attorney for the Energy
Research Foundation.
   ``This hot water discharge will wipe out virtually all aquatic
life and all vegetation within the receiving streams,'' Chandler
said. ``It will cause a loss of 10 to 12 acres of forested wetlands
each year.''
   The reactor will discharge water at between 150 degrees and 170
degrees, while federal law prohibits hot water discharges of more
than 90 degress, he said.
   U.S. Department of Energy spokesman Tim Tomastik, whose
organization owns the Savannah River Site, refused to comment on
the lawsuit because the issue was in litigation. The government has
60 days to respond.
   The reactors, located near Aiken near the Georgia line, were
closed in 1988 after an accident at one unit raised questions about
safety standards and the risk of mechanical failures. More than $1
billion is being spent to upgrade the reactors and retrain workers.
   The plant produces tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen
used to make H-bombs. Tritiums decays at a rate of 5.5 percent a
year, meaning quantities in warheads must be replenished. The
government says its stockpile of tritium is running low, although
information about tritium inventories is classified.
   In May, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins announced a tentative
schedule providing for the restart of the K reactor in December.
However, a cooling tower that would lower the temperature of
discharged water is not scheduled for completion until 1992.
   The lawsuit filed Monday asks that the K reactor not be operated
until the cooling tower is completed.
   ``Restarting K reactor is unsafe and unnecessary,'' said Frances
Hart, local coordinator of the Energy Research Foundation, a
private non-profit environmentalist group. ``It's time the
government started obeying its own laws.''

   Retired Army Gen. Isaac David White, a
highly decorated officer who led major armored assaults in World
War II and Korea, has died. He was 89.
   White died Monday at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center.
   Much of his military career paralleled the development of modern
armor and armored warfare tactics.
   In April 1945, White's forces played a major role in sealing
Germany's Ruhr Valley pocket, covering 190 miles in 13 days and
capturing more than 45,000 prisoners. His troops were the first
Allied soldiers to cross the Elbe River on the way to capture
Berlin and end the war in Europe.
   Before Korea, White headed the Cavalry School at Fort Riley,
Kan., and commanded the U.S. Constabulary in Germany for three
years before serving as commanding general of the Armored Center at
Fort Knox, Ky.
   White also created a tank training center at Vilseck, West
Germany, which has become a model for armor training around the
world.
   White helped speed the design, manufacture and procurement of
new armored weapons for the Korean War, and went to Korea in 1952
to command troops through three mountain campaigns.
   He was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster to the Distinguished Service
Medal and the Korean Order of Military Merit Taeguk for those
initiatives. White held 13 U.S. and 16 foreign decorations,
including the Distinguished Service Medal.
   He was born in Peterborough, N.H., graduated from Norwich
University in Vermont in 1922 and later became a trustee of the
school. He retired to Dublin, N.H., in 1961 after more than 38
years of active duty. He was director of the New Hampshire Council
on World Affairs.

   USAir said its staff erred in not detaining Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis for questioning when he warned as he boarded a
plane that there could be a bomb in a White House aide's luggage.
   An airline supervisor who was present recognized the governor
and determined the comments were made in a joking manner, Patricia
Goldman, a spokeswoman for USAir in Arlington, Va., said Monday.
   The flight Sunday night took off from Logan International
Airport as scheduled, bound for Washington D.C.
   Ms. Goldman said allowing Dukakis to board was an ``error in
procedure.'' Federal Aviation Administration rules say anyone who
comments about devices that could threaten passengers faces
detainment, questioning and a possible fine.
   Dukakis aimed his barb at Ron Kaufman, a Republican political
operative who Democrats claim conspired with a police union to
disrupt the state Democratic Convention in Springfield with a
demonstation June 2.
   ``After going through the experiences that the Democrats went
through in Springfield, I can tell you we will always be concerned
when Mr. Kaufman is around,'' Dukakis told reporters in Washington.
   As to his comment, the governor said, ``The humor of it was
obvious to everyone who was there.''
   Kaufman said he didn't think bombs were funny.
   ``Given the psychological terror people have of bombs and
flying, it was irresponsible for a man in his position to joke
about something like that,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Kohl Making no Promises on Sanctions, but Mandela Hopeful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela met with top West
German politicians on Tuesday to argue for continued international
sanctions against South Africa but came away with no clear promises
from Helmut Kohl.
   Mandela told reporters after his meeting with the West German
chancellor that Kohl had initially favored a review of sanctions
when the European Economic Community meets this month in Dublin.
   ``But I think, without speaking for him, after listening to our
argument he is now prepared to reconsider. That was my distinct
impression,'' the deputy leader of the African National Congress
said.
   Mandela is on a tour of Europe and North America to urge the
West not to lift economic sanctions against the white-led
government in South Africa.
   Some countries, notably Britain, have said South African
President F.W. de Klerk should be rewarded for the steps he has
taken toward ending the country's system of racial discrimination.
   Those measures have included freeing Mandela after nearly three
decades in jail, legalizing the black nationalist movement and,
engaging in a dialogue with black leaders, including Mandela.
   Mandela maintains it was only the persistence of the African
National Congress and the economic sanctions that prompted peace
talks, and that apartheid has not been completely dismantled.
   Without directly addressing the sanctions issue, Kohl's office
issued a statement saying: ``The chancellor underscores the
necessity for the quick and complete elimination of the existing
apartheid structures and the full inclusion of all South Africans''
in the political process.
   Mandela said his position was unequivocably endorsed by West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a member of a
junior coalition partner in Kohl's government.
   ``He is a strong supporter of the view that sanctions must be
maintained,'' said Mandela, who met with Genscher for an hour
Tuesday morning.
   In his meeting with Kohl, Mandela said he also raised the issue
of economic assistance from West Germany to help with the
repatriation of an expected 20,000 returning exiles.
   The European Economic Community, of which West Germany is an
influential member, agreed on a series of non-binding measures
against South Africa in 1986, banning the imports of iron, steel
and gold coins, worth $600 million in 1985. The EEC also banned new
investments in South Africa.
   Although no agenda has yet been set, the issue of sanctions is
expected to come up next week at a meeting of community foreign
ministers in Luxembourg and at the full meeting later this month in
Dublin.
   In February, Britain unilaterally lifted its ban on new
investments in South Africa.
   Mandela was freed from prison that month after 27 years in jail
by the de Klerk government.

<TEXT>
   The Liberian government and rebels
began peace talks Tuesday, and President Samuel K. Doe reportedly
said he would welcome an international peacekeeping mission to his
West African nation.
   In Liberia, government officials took journalists 35 miles from
the capital to the international airport to prove the government
still controlled the airport contrary to claims by the rebel
National Patriotic Front.
   The peace talks were held in the auditorium of the U.S.
Embassy's cultural center in Freetown, with Liberian religious
leaders acting as mediators.
   Talks were to have opened Monday but were delayed when rebel
sources said their delegation was taking a roundabout route to
neighboring Sierra Leone to avoid the danger of attack.
   Host Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Karim opened the meeting by
saying Sierra Leone wants an end to the 5{-month-old conflict,
which has killed more than 1,000 people and prompted thousands of
Liberians to flee into Sierra Leone.
   Sierra Leone and U.S. officials then left and the Liberian
delegations met behind closed doors.
   Tambakai Jangaxa, chief government delegate and president pro
tem of the Liberian senate, and Thomas Woweiyu, a top leader and
spokesman of the National Patriotic Front movement, both strongly
stated their positions, mediators said. The rebels accuse Doe's
people of corruption, economic mismanagement and human rights
abuses.
   The Rev. Levee Multon, peace talks chairman and president of the
Liberian Council of Churches, said after the session adjourned
Tuesday night that talks will resume Wednesday.
   He added, ``Everything was done in an atmosphere of respect,
cordiality and understanding and it looks like we are in for a
fruitful conference.''
   The talks could break down if rebels stick to their demand that
Doe resign and leave the country before they will agree to a
cease-fire.
   Doe agreed to the talks after the rebels, led by former civil
servant Charles Taylor, advanced to within 25 miles of Monrovia.
His troops, unable to halt the rebels since they invaded from Ivory
Coast on Dec. 24, were accused of killing hundreds of civilians
believed to support the insurgents.
   Liberian state radio Tuesday quoted Doe as saying he would
welcome the presence of an international peacekeeping force in
Liberia if one were agreed to at the Freetown negotiations.
   The rebels met little resistance until a week ago, when
government troops recaptured the headquarters of a U.S.-managed
rubber plantation near the international airport.
   Rebels say they took back the plantation later.
   On Tuesday, foreign reporters accompanied by a government
official drove to Robertsfield International Airport, which is next
to the plantation.
   Reporters said they passed through heavily manned checkpoints
and that many soldiers guarded the airport.
   They said they heard only an occasional gunshot. Airlines halted
flights to the airport June 3.
   More than 100,000 plantation workers and war refugees, including
at least 20 expatriate managers, have been trapped by the fighting.
   The British Embassy announced Tuesday it was organizing a convoy
to Sierra Leone on Wednesday. More than 1,000 Britons remain in the
capital Monrovia.
   The U.S. Embassy organized its last air evacuation Sunday. More
than 1,000 Americans remain, many of them Liberians who hold U.S.
passports.
   About 500 Liberian refugees are fleeing daily to Sierra Leone,
Raymond Hall, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, said Tuesday in Geneva.
   He said 10,000 people recently escaped the fighting and his
agency expected the refugee population to swell to 20,000.
   The United Nations estimates there are already about 60,000
Liberian refugees in the Ivory Coast and 80,000 in Guinea.
   In Clay Ashland, Liberia, hundreds of wailing and weeping
mourners on Tuesday buried three civilians, including prominent
sculptor R. Vanjah Richards, who were reported killed by soldiers.
   ``The soldiers who attacked us, brutalized us and did this are
paid by us, the taxpayer,'' Episcopal Bishop George D. Brown told
mourners outside the Baptist church at Clay Ashland.
   Richards, 48, was mayor of the small town just west of Monrovia
and professor of fine arts at the University of Liberia.
   Many descendants of the freed Americans slaves who founded
Liberia oppose Doe's government. Doe seized power in a violent 1980
coup that ousted elitist Americo-Liberians who had governed the
country and discriminated against native Liberians.

<HEAD>South American Kidnappers of U.S. Miner Upset With Currency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attempts to free an American miner kidnapped
by South American guerrillas hit a snag when a go-between brought
the ransom in U.S. dollars instead of Colombian pesos, the
hostage's father said Tuesday.
   ``The intermediary had problems getting up the river (to the
kidnappers) because they've had heavy rain and the river is
swollen,'' Roy Heimdal said.
   ``Then the guerrillas got upset because the ransom money came in
U.S. dollars instead of pesos. When they tried to exchange it, they
had trouble finding enough pesos,'' Heimdal said. ``So things
aren't going so smoothly.''
   Heimdal said he and his wife, Marge, had believed the kidnappers
wanted $60,000 in U.S. currency in exchange for the freedom of
their 27-year-old son, Scott.
   The Heimdals traveled to Chicago on Tuesday with their
daughters, Linda and Angela, to obtain passports so they can travel
to Quito, Ecuador, when their son is released.
   Roy Heimdal said the kidnappers also were upset after seeing
coverage on Cable News Network of the family's effort last week to
raise the ransom.
   ``They saw pictures of our house,'' Heimdal said of the family's
modest, wood-frame bungalow in a middle-class Peoria neighborhood.
   ``Our house is no mansion. But by their standards it is. I guess
they figure anyone who eats three square meals a day has $60,000
laying around.''
   Heimdal said the unidentified intermediary was trying to
convince the kidnappers the working-class family really is
financially strapped. The family's life savings were wiped out by
medical bills after Mrs. Heimdal was seriously injured in a 1983
wreck with an uninsured drunken driver.
   There were no reports Tuesday from Ecuador.
   Heimdal said recent heavy rains there have swollen rivers,
making travel to the guerrilla's jungle hideout difficult and
slowing negotiations.
   But the family has solved its own transportation problems.
   Heimdal said a Florida travel agent has stepped forward to
guarantee them passage to Quito.
   Last week, Midway Airlines donated two plane tickets to get the
Heimdals to Miami, but they did not have tickets to South America.
   ``A woman who wants to remain anonymous called and offered us
tickets the rest of the way,'' Heimdal said. ``She said her
daughter was kidnapped and murdered a few years ago and she wants
to help us out. She is arranging a flight to Quito from Miami.''
   Heimdal said the family will stay in Illinois until they receive
word their son is free before leaving for Ecuador.
   The Colombian guerrilla group believed to have kidnapped Scott
Heimdal on April 28 has a long history of kidnappings and violence,
State Department records show.
   John Reap of the State Department's counterterrorism bureau said
that while there is no proof the group known as EPL was involved in
the abduction, it seems likely.
   ``We feel it's a strong possibility, since kidnappings strictly
for money, with no political factors involved, have been part of
their past conduct,'' he said.
   Reap said the United States is not treating Heimdal's kidnapping
as an act of international terrorism because the only motive
appears to be money.
   Scott Heimdal was abducted while working for the Iminco Gold
Mining Co. in northern Ecuador near the Colombian border.
   His purported captors, the Popular Liberation Army (EPL),
initially demanded $1.2 million for his release, but later lowered
their demand to $60,000.
   According to State Department documents, the Popular Liberation
Army _ the EPL stands for its Spanish name ``Ejercito Popular de
Liberacion'' _ was formed in late 1967 by a small group of
Colombian Maoists.

   An investigator has
recommended modifications to a Boeing aircraft after blaming a fire
in the cargo section for the crash of a South African Airways jet.
The 1987 crash near Mauritius killed all 159 people aboard.
   Sabotage was ruled out in the report by Justice Cecil Margo in
newspapers Tuesday but no cause could be determined for the fire in
the Boeing 747-200 Combi.
   The plane, en route from Taipei, Taiwan, to Johannesburg,
plunged into the Indian Ocean about 1,500 miles east of
Johannesburg on Nov. 28, 1987. Most of the passengers on Flight 295
were Japanese, Taiwanese or South African.
   Margo called for changes in the Combi configuration planes that
have an extra-large cargo hold on the same level as the passenger
section and cockpit.
   He said smoke and gasses spread quickly through the passenger
section and possibly the cockpit. Plastic and cardboard packing
were involved in the blaze, according to the investigation report.
   ``There was a strong possibility'' gases and smoke overwhelmed
the flight crew, the report said.
   Margo's report said the smoke-detection, firefighting equipment
and safety procedures on the plane were inadequate.
   Until such problems are corrected, ``the Combi configuration,
with passengers and cargo on the same deck ... should be prohibited
as creating an unacceptable risk,'' Margo said.
   He said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board had
rejected his recommendation for modifications to the plane, but the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had issued new directives to
minimize fire hazards on the Combi.
   South African Airways has since removed the cargo section from
the passenger level on its one remaining Combi.
   Jack Gamble, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Group in
Renton, Wash., said company officials had not seen the judge's
report.
   He noted the FAA had called for changes in firefighting
procedures and ``some minor design modifications'' in DC-10 and 747
combination passenger-cargo aircraft.
   New planes incorporate the recommendations, and manufacturers
are working to retrofit older aircraft, Gamble said.
   ``We feel those (FAA) recommendations are adequate,'' he said.
``How those changes relate to what the judge ordered, we don't
know.''
   Margo prohibited public release of the full transcript of the
cockpit voice recording, saying it might be misunderstood or cause
embarrassment.
   The release of the report was slowed by the complicated recovery
of wreckage from about 15,000 feet underwater.
   The report said investigators could find no evidence of an
explosion in the wreckage.
   ``It is virtually certain there was no sabotage,'' the report
said.
   The investigation probed the cause, not liability. The airline
reached an out-of-court financial settlement with relatives of the
victims and no court cases are pending or expected.

   Firefighters boarded a burning
supertanker Tuesday, and brought under control the fierce blaze
that has left the oil-laden vessel crippled and leaking in the Gulf
of Mexico, officials said.
   Oil continued leaking from the ship, the Coast Guard said.
   A thick cloud of gray smoke surrounded the superstructure of the
886-foot Mega Borg, replacing the balls of flame and towering
columns of black smoke that had been billowing from the Norwegian
vessel since an engine-room explosion Saturday.
   Coast Guard Capt. Tom Greene said that Ted Hoskins, who heads
the salvage operation, boarded the ship with a crew. Hoskins ``said
he would characterize the fire as under control,'' Greene said.
   Greene said he could see no fires in the latest videos taken on
the ship, but added a fire was still burning below deck.
   The fire has been ``pinned down'' in the engine room and the
pumping room, spokesman Daan Kaakebeen of Smit Internationale, the
Dutch salvage company leading the firefighting effort, said earlier
in Rotterdam.
   The Coast Guard also revised its estimate of the amount of oil
on the water to less than 2,000 gallons, a fraction of the 100,000
gallons officials estimated earlier. The amount that had spilled
from the tanker, which was carrying 38 million gallons of light
African crude, was not determined.
   Much of the oil that spilled had burned off, but with the fire
now confined, ``there is more oil in the water and the slick is
continuing to grow,'' Greene said.
   Still, Coast Guard officials said they believe a disastrous
spill can be avoided because the light crude can be easily
dispersed.
   Meanwhile, Mexico sent a collector vessel to help clean up the
spill.
   Pemex, the Mexican government oil monopoly, said that at the
U.S. government's request, it sent the 146-foot Ecopemex, which can
suck up oil and water at the rate of 2,000 barrels an hour,
separate out the oil and store it in special tanks.
   Crewmen boarded the tanker to determine if it had cooled enough
to be sprayed with flame-smothering chemical foam. Foam spraying
has been delayed since Monday because the ship was too hot and
crews feared another explosion even if the flames were doused.
   Officials speculated it could take as little as an hour to pump
the foam into the engine room and other areas still burning.
   ``We're hoping the foam application is a success,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Howard Holmes. If it isn't, ``we can't deny the
fact that we could be in trouble, but we are optimistic that the
foam will work.''
   Crews aimed 10 water streams from five fireboats stationed at
the sides of the tanker, and firefighters had placed another water
hose on the deck, pointing it toward the burning stern.
   ``They've kept applying water in great quantities and it's
continued to cool the structure,'' Greene said. ``They'll continue
to do that. There's progress being made. They're making ground.''
   Efforts to dissipate an oil leak apparently also were having
some success. The oil slick around the ship diminished to three
miles by 10 miles, Petty Officer Gene Maestas said. Most of what
remained appeared in a light sheen with few heavy concentrations.
   The ship is 57 miles southeast of Galveston. None of the spilled
oil is expected to reach the coastline immediately. The Coast Guard
said it was moving daily about three to four miles to the northwest.
   ``We're still not completely safe from a major release until the
fire is out and the ship is stabilized and it is brought on an even
keel,'' Greene said.
   Once the fire was extinguished, an 825-foot British-registered
tanker, the Vic Bilh, was standing by to begin receiving the
remainder of the Mega Borg's cargo of crude, Maestas said. Greene
said that operation could be dangerous because the ship is listing
slightly and crews might have to pump water into the holds to keep
the vessel balanced.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Coast Guard said part of the vessel showed
signs of buckling because of the intense 900-degree blaze, the
shifting cargo and the continuous stream of water being poured on
the hulk. But later, officials said crews at the scene reported no
signs of major structural damage.
   The ship's left rear section, however, was very close to the
water line. On Monday, the rear had dipped below the surface,
heightening fears the vessel might sink.
   ``I'd say the chance of sinking is very slight at this point
because they have the fire well pushed back in the ship,'' Greene
said Tuesday.
   The rear has dropped more than 60 feet since the tanker caught
fire early Saturday while transferring cargo to a smaller vessel.
Two of the 41 crewmen died, two were missing and presumed dead and
17 were injured, none seriously.
   The Norwegian government scheduled a hearing for Wednesday
morning in Galveston to interview crew members who were aboard at
the time of the blast and try to determine how it occurred.
   Little oil spilled at first, but five explosions within 20
minutes Sunday sent burning crude pouring into the Gulf. By
Tuesday, a burning trail of oil that extended for hundreds of feet
behind the stricken tanker had diminished to a small pool.
   The Mega Borg was carrying more than three times as much oil as
was spilled by the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in March 1989 in the
nation's worst oil spill. But the oil spilled in Alaska was heavy
crude, which doesn't dissipate nearly as rapidly as the light crude
aboard the Mega Borg. Also, much of the oil spilling off Texas was
being consumed by fire.
   Currents and winds were expected to push oil toward a 200-mile
stretch of coast between Freeport and Corpus Christi, an area
considered a prime bird breeding and shellfish harvest area.
   The tanker, operated by Mosvolds Shipping of Farsund, Norway,
was bound from Palanca, Angola. It was scheduled to travel to Aruba
after Galveston.
   Elf, a Houston subsidiary of a French oil distribution company,
owned the cargo and said it would participate in the cleanup. But a
company official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Tuesday
he did not believe Elf was liable for the costs.

   Explosions leveled a fireworks factory
Tuesday, killing two workers, injuring two others and shaking
windows as far as 30 miles away, authorities said.
   ``It sounded like the biggest bomb that ever was,'' said Norma
Oswalt who lives about three miles northeast of the plant. ``It
shook my back porch and shook the screens all over the house.''
   Another fireworks plant blast seriously injured a worker near
Elkton, Md.
   One of the several explosions about 9 a.m. at the Mid-South
Pyrotechnics plant six miles southeast of this east-central
Mississippi town killed two employees, Lowndes County Coroner Don
Harris said. They were burned beyond recognition but were
identified as Herman J. Hallman, 65, and Frank Young, 37, both of
Columbus, he said.
   Employee Sally Brandon was hospitalized after being thrown 100
feet by one of the blasts, Harris said. Golden Triangle Regional
Medical Center Hospital spokeswoman Cynthia Rose would say only
that Brandon was in stable condition.
   Plant owner Gene Beatty was slightly injured, and a visitor to
the plant escaped injury.
   Agents of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
arrived to help determine what sparked the explosions, local
emergency Director Bennie McDow said.
   A metal girder flew 300 feet from the plant and smoldering bits
of wood and concrete and firecracker wrappers landed even further
away. One of the blasts left a crater about 5 feet deep and 50 feet
wide.
   ``We felt two distinct booms, and the windows on the east side
of our building, which is located in the center of campus, were
rattled,'' said Sammy McDavid, spokesman for Mississippi State
University, 30 miles to the west. ``It did no damage here.
   ``It was one of those things that you say, `What was that?'''
   A one-mile area was evacuated for fear more blasts would occur,
but by midafternoon the evacuation area was reduced to about 200
feet around the brick building, which once had been a school.
Firefighters spent the afternoon dousing the charred rubble.
Remnants of the plant's stock crackled and popped in the smoking
debris.
   ``My concern is that there is another full ton of fireworks that
haven't exploded there,'' said Sheriff Ed Prescott.
   The worker injured at the New Jersey Fireworks plant in
northeastern Maryland had worked there for nearly 30 years and was
the only person in the building at the time, state fire marshal's
spokesman Bob Thomas said.
   George Carroll, 65, was in critical condition at a Baltimore
hospital after suffering second and third-degree burns over 72
percent of his body, Francis Scott Key Medical Center spokeswoman
Terrie O'Sullivan said.
   The first explosion occurred in a building used to make Roman
candles. Fire then spread to a second building; both buildings were
destroyed, a fire department spokesman said.
   The explosion was the second in a week near Elkton, said Al
Ward, deputy state fire marshal, who estimated the damages at
$6,000. As a result, State Fire Marshal Rocco Gabriele ordered
inspections of Maryland's four fireworks plants, all in Cecil
County, Thomas said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens' conviction on a
charge he had sex with a teen-age girl was upheld Tuesday by a
state appeals court.
   The 59-year-old Republican was convicted May 26, 1989, of a
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor. He
was accused of paying a girl to have sex with him at his Columbus
apartment in November 1988 when she was 16.
   Lukens was sentenced to six months in jail and fined $500.
   The congressman has 30 days to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court
and will remain free on bond during that time, said an attorney for
Lukens, Thomas Tyack.
   Lukens spoke with Tyack and other attorneys by telephone from
Washington to discuss the case, said Lukens aide Joe Bukovac.
   ``In the decision passed down there is a determination of errors
made by the judge in the courtroom on several issues,'' Bukovac
said. ``At this point, there are a concensus of Lukens' legal
advisers leaning toward further appeal.''
   A three-judge panel of the 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals
rejected arguments by Lukens' attorneys that Franklin County
Domestic Relations Judge Ronald Solove erred by barring testimony
about the girl's record of juvenile offenses.
   Lukens' attorneys also contended that Solove's definition of an
unruly child differed from the definition in Lukens' indictment.
   In addition, they said the judge improperly overruled defense
motions for a mistrial after prosecutors tried to use inadmissible
testimony of sex between Ms. Coffman and Lukens in 1985. They
further said the court abused its discretion in sentencing Lukens.
   The appeals judges rejected all the arguments.
   ``I get frustrated in cases of this nature to be told yes, there
were errors committed but it doesn't matter,'' Tyack said.
   Tyack said the evidence about the girl's past was necessary to
establish she already was unruly and to challenge her credibility.
   But the appeals court said Tyack failed to show the records were
relevant.
   Lukens lost his bid for a third consecutive term in the 8th
Congressional District GOP primary in May.
   A week before the election, he publicly apologized for what he
called ``a dumb mistake'' and asked voters to forgive him. But he
maintained he was innocent of the charge.
   Allegations that Lukens had sex with the girl surfaced in early
1989. Shortly afterward, a Columbus television station broadcast a
videotape of a November 1988 meeting between Lukens and the girl's
mother, Anna Coffman, who confronted Lukens about the relationship.
Lukens did not know the meeting at a local fast-food restaurant was
being taped by a TV crew.
   On the tape, Lukens offered to find Mrs. Coffman a government
job after she accused him of ``messing around'' with her daughter.
   Lukens served two terms in Congress, from 1967 to 1970, and then
made an unsuccessful attempt to gain the GOP gubernatorial
nomination in Ohio. After 15 years in the Ohio Senate, he was
returned to Congress by voters in 1986. He was re-elected in 1988.

   President Bush, likening himself to a ``spring
colt'' on his 66th birthday, prodded Republicans Tuesday night to
``end the Democratic stranglehold'' on Congress by recapturing the
Senate.
   ``I feel it in my bones, we can get the majority of the
Senate,'' Bush told a GOP fundraiser in his honor.
   More than 4,000 Republicans at the banquet stood and sang
``Happy Birthday Mr. President.'' Former Senate Republican Leader
Howard H. Baker of Tennessee said the event raised some $6.9
million for Republican Senate and House candidates for fall
elections.
   The current Senate Minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, told
Bush that the Senate vote earlier in the evening sustaining Bush's
veto of a $2 billion Amtrak authorization bill was the president's
real birthday president.
   And Vice President Dan Quayle said that ``the Democrats have had
their turn. Now it's our turn'' to control the Senate.
   Bush told the gathering: ``What's scaring the heck out of our
opponents is the simple fact that this fall, they're up against the
Republican record.''
   ``This year's election presents an opportunity for us to regain
a majority in the Senate. We can end the Democratic stranglehold on
the U.S. Congress,'' Bush said. Democrats now control the Senate by
55-45.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bush said turning 66 was ``slightly worse than
being 65 but not bad.''
   ``I feel like a spring colt,'' Bush told reporters. However, he
did admit to starting off the day ``kind of regretting it.''
   ``It's been a good birthday. I hadn't thought so. But good cake,
good cards and _ not bad,'' he told reporters after giving a talk
in the Rose Garden reiterating his support for a constitutional
amendment to ban flag-desecration.
   Senior White House staff members gave Bush a brown leather
briefcase for his birthday. And Bush was being feted at a GOP
dinner expected to raise several million dollars for GOP Senate and
House candidates.
   Bush and Quayle were hosts of the annual $1,500-a-plate
President's Dinner, which this year falls on the president's
birthday.
   Composer Marvin Hamlisch was to perform a song specially written
for the event.
   Earlier, Republican lawmakers burst into a rendition of ``Happy
Birthday'' at a White House GOP leadership meeting.
   Some reporters showed up at a picture-taking session at the
start of the meeting wearing children's birthday hats to honor the
occasion.
   ``It's a vast improvement,'' Bush said.
   He agreed to amend his own policy against answering questions at
picture-taking sessions. But, Bush said, ``only those wearing hats
get their questions answered.''
   In response to one query, Bush said he did not know if Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had sent him a birthday card. But,
he added diplomatically, ``I've got to be careful. He may well have
sent something.''
   Bush's wife, Barbara, turned 65 last Friday.
   The annual black-tie GOP event was sponsored by the National
Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
   Some 4,000 guests paid for tickets.
   It was at the same event two years ago that then-Vice President
Bush was formally endorsed for the GOP presidential nomination by
President Reagan.

   Premature, low-birth-weight babies given special
education from the start scored significantly higher on IQ tests at
age 3 than their counterparts who weren't helped, researchers said
Tuesday.
   Infants born weighing between 4.4 pounds and 5.5 pounds who
received special educational help in addition to medical care
scored an average of 98 on IQ tests taken at age 3, the researchers
wrote.
   That was 13.2 IQ points higher than subjects who were born in
the same weight range but who received only the medical care, said
the researchers, who were led by Dr. Ruth Gross of Stanford
University.
   Infants who weighed about 4.3 pounds or less at birth and were
given the educational help scored an average of 91 at age 3, or 6.6
IQ points higher than counterparts who got only medical care, the
group reported in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   ``The predictiveness for the scores at age 3 means good things
for the kids (who were helped) in the years ahead,'' said Dr. Donna
Bryant, a study participant and research psychologist at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   ``The fact that the differences were so great means that fewer
of these kids will be held back in school,'' she said.
   The four-year study involved 985 babies born in 1985 in eight
states _ Arkansas, New York, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas,
Washington, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. One-third received the
educational help, two-thirds did not.
   Almost 7 percent of babies born annually in the United States,
or 250,000, are of low-birth weight, 5.5 pounds or less, said Gross.
   Thanks to advances in technology, almost all babies born
weighing more than 4.5 pounds survive, and those weighing about 2
pounds have a 20 percent chance of survival, Gross said.
   But she added that all low-birth-weight babies risk
developmental problems.
   Of the children studied, those not helped educationally were 2.7
times more likely to have IQs in the mental retardation range,
below 70, the study found. An average IQ for all people is 100.
   In the study, the babies who were helped had researchers visit
their families' homes weekly during the child's first year to
advise the parents and make sure the babies had educational toys.
   At 1 year old, the child started going to a child development
center five days a week, while researchers continued visiting the
home every two weeks.
   The researchers also held group meetings for parents every two
weeks to give advice about child rearing and health and safety.
   Berry Brazelton, a pediatrics professor at Harvard University's
medical school, said the study results ``certainly showed the
importance of early intervention. ... The critical part of this
study is the first year.''
   But Arnold Sameroff, a psychologist who teaches at Brown
University and practices at Bradley Hospital in Providence, R.I.,
said other researchers will find it hard to tell what in the
multifaceted treatment made the difference.
   Universities involved in the $33 million study were the
University of Arkansas, Little Rock; Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, New York; Harvard Medical School, Boston; University of
Miami in Florida; University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia;
University of Texas, Dallas; University of Washington, Seattle; and
Yale University, New Haven, Conn.

<HEAD>Liberal Vice Minister of Culture Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's most famous actor-politician, Ying
Ruocheng, has been dismissed as vice minister of culture, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday.
   Ying, along with the culture minister, short-story writer Wang
Meng, was a proponent of greater artistic freedom. Wang was fired
as minister in September.
   No explaination was given for Ying's dismissal.
   Official reports initially said Wang wanted more time to write,
but later said he was in poor health.
   Both moves appeared to be part of the Communist leadership's
effort to restore tight controls over artists since suppressing
last year's mass pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Ying played no public role in the student-led democracy movement
and is not known to have supported it. But the crushing of the
movement created a political backlash in which conservatives gained
the upper hand and have tried to rein in liberalism, especially in
the arts.
   As a director, Ying introduced several Western plays to Chinese
audiences, including Shakespeare's ``Measure for Measure'' and
``The Tempest,'' and Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman,'' in
which Ying played Willy Loman.
   In Bernardo Bertolucci's movie ``The Last Emperor,'' filmed in
China, Ying played the jailer who helps remold deposed Emperor Pu
Yi into a socialist citizen. He also played Mongol emperor Kublai
Khan in the 1982 television mini-series ``Marco Polo,'' produced by
Italy, the United States, Japan and China.
   Ying's dismissal was one of several high-level personnel changes
approved since May 18 by the State Council, China's cabinet, Xinhua
said. It was the first time any of the changes have been disclosed.
   Also dismissed was a second vice minister of culture, Wang Jifu,
a career party official. Xinhua said Ying and Wang were replaced by
Xu Wenbo and Chen Changben.
   Xu is a member of the party's Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, which is in charge of disciplining party members.

   Southern Baptists elected a fundamentalist
minister president Tuesday, solidifying conservative control of the
nation's largest Protestant denomination.
   The Rev. Morris Chapman of Wichita Falls, Texas, defeated the
candidate backed by moderates, the Rev. Daniel Vestal of the
Atlanta suburb of Dunwoody. The 21,471-to-15,753 vote gave Chapman
a 58 percent majority.
   The convention moved toward curtailing funding for the
Washington-based Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, which
lobbies for religious freedom on behalf of nine Baptist bodies.
Fundamentalists have denounced the lobby for opposing organized
prayer in public schools and for not opposing abortion.
   The election outcome extended fundamentalist control for the
12th straight year. Some moderates predicted they would give up
trying to retake control of the 14.9 million-member denomination.
Some also said its national operations, with a budget of more than
$440 million a year, would lose much support from moderates.
   Chapman said at a post-election news conference that he would
seek ``peace and harmony'' in the denomination, but ``what we
believe about the Bible is non-negotiable.'' He said he has ``never
advocated any wholesale housecleaning'' of those not accepting
belief in an infallible Bible.
   Nearly all Southern Baptists are theological conservatives,
devoted to the Bible's authority, but fundamentalists stress its
``inerrancy'' _ that it is without error in any way, historically,
scientifically or religiously.
   They also have imposed detailed questioning in denominational
agencies and institutions to assure adherence of personnel to the
expanded requirements.
   The Southern Baptist presidency is one of the most powerful
offices in U.S. Christianity, with appointive powers controlling
selection of governing trustees of a far-flung network of agencies
and institutions.
   Chapman said he would advocate attrition to get rid of staff
members, executives or seminary professors who could not subscribe
to an ``inerrant'' Bible. He said he felt that in time they would
``find a home more in line with their convictions.''
   Members of First Baptist Church in Wichita Falls, where Chapman
has been pastor since 1979, said they think Chapman is the kind of
person who can mend the denomination's rift.
   ``I see him as someone that can play the role of a peacemaker.
So I'm excited about it,'' said Tom Bacus, 44, a deacon of the
4,000-member church.
   Although some moderates including Vestal are fundamentalist, or
literalist, about the Bible, they leave room for other
understandings under the Baptist view of ``soul competence'' of the
individual.
   The Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., who is completing
his term as president, told the convention that some want to leave
``room for all'' in the denomination, but ``that's too much room.''
   He said denominations that haven't insisted on an ``infallible
inerrant'' Bible were bound for ``the garbage dump.''
   The convention approved a change recommended by the executive
committee to turn over religious liberty concerns to the
denomination's Christian Life Commission. This was expected to lead
Wednesday to a vote to cut out 87 percent of Southern Baptist
support, or $365,328, from the Baptist Joint Committee on Public
Affairs.
   Numerous speakers protested turning over lobbying to a
commission concerned with morality and abandoning the joint
committee.
   Henry Green of Cocoa, Fla., pleaded that ``we maintain
fellowship'' with other Baptists, saying ``it is unbilibal to
railroad through this plan to destroy cooperation.''
   The campaigns for the presidency were intensified this time by
added fundamentalist attacks on seminaries, including the
administration and some professors at the 131-year-old flagship
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   Its president, the Rev. Roy Honeycutt, and the faculty have
struck back, calling accusations of ``doctrinal infidelity'' false
distortions that ``sow seeds of hate.''
   Chapman, 49, a Mississippi native, got his theological education
at Southwester Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.
He was pastor of churches in Albuquerque, N.M., and in Waco and
Rogers, Texas, before assuming his present pastorate at First
Baptist Church in Wichita Falls, Texas.
   Vestal, 46, the son of an evangelist, also got his ministerial
education at the Fort Worth seminary. He previously led churches in
Arlington, Fort Worth and Midland, Texas, before becoming pastor of
Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta.

   A federal judge ordered an oil tanker
impounded Tuesday so that New Jersey, New York and New York City
can guarantee that the vessels owner pay for damages resulting from
last week's 260,000-gallon oil spill.
   ``This order gives us the power to prevent them from moving the
ship until we're satisfied,'' said Gordon Johnson, an assistant
attorney general for the state of New York.
   Johnson said Govs. Jim Florio of New Jersey and Mario Cuomo of
New York decided to seek the impoundment of the vessel because
officials received word that the ship BT Nautilus could be ready to
move as early as Wednesday from Bayonne, where it was docking
Thursday when it ran aground.
   Charles Anderson, a New York City attorney representing the
811-foot ship's owners, Nautilus Motor Tanker Co. of London,
characterized U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan's order as
routine in maritime cases..
   Anderson said the ship was under repair and no decisions have
been made on moving it. He said the company's underwriters are
working on posting a bond to guarantee payment of cleanup costs.
   Workers collected about 100 gallons of oil waste that washed up
along a five-mile stretch of Sandy Hook beach Tuesday, including
three miles of beaches where swimming is normally permitted,
according to the National Parks Service. The beach was clean by 5
p.m., said parks service spokesman Manny Strumpf.
   The Coast Guard has not determined the cause of the grounding.
   Navigational charts of the area where the BT Nautilus ran
aground are accurate, and the accident would not have occurred if
the ship had been following the proper route, said Capt. Robert
North, coordinator of the cleanup.
   A grand jury is to meet this week to consider charges that the
tanker's first mate, Gregory Frederick Geoffrey, 52, of New Marske,
England, was operating a vessel while intoxicated, said Christopher
Florentz, a spokesman for the New Jersey attorney general's office.
   The Coast Guard said tests of the captain, Albert Ainscough, and
the pilot, Jim Naughton, showed no traces of drug or alcohol use.
   The BT Nautilus ran aground while being docked, ripping a
30-foot-long gash in its hull and pouring 260,000 gallons of No. 6
industrial heating oil into the Kill van Kull, a busy waterway
separating Bayonne from the New York City borough of Staten Island.
   Attorneys for New York and New Jersey argued that the captain
and crew were ``incompetent, inattentive, reckless and otherwise
grossly negligent in their duties, which resulted in the general
unseaworthiness of the BT Nautilus.'' That condition caused the
``illegal discharge of oil,'' according to papers filed in federal
court.
   Anderson said the allegations were ``totally unfounded,'' and
noted that the cause of the investigation remained under
investigation.
   The spill was the fourth major one in the waterway and nearby
Arthur Kill this year.

<HEAD>Newsprint Suppliers Raise Prices 5 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most North American newsprint producers
increased prices about 5 percent in June, the first broad hike in
more than two years. But buyers say they'll resist paying it
because of plentiful supplies.
   Industry analysts and purchasers say the $35 increase, which
raised the benchmark eastern U.S. list price of standard newsprint
to $685 a metric ton, hinges mainly on whether labor negotiations
are settled at mills in eastern Canada, the world's largest single
source of newsprint.
   ``The labor dispute is probably the only thing that's keeping
the price increase in place now,'' said Dan Dowis, director of
newsprint for Knight-Ridder Inc., one of the nation's largest
newspaper groups.
   If the negotiations are settled without a strike, ``you'll see a
lot of (the increase) going back to purchasers in the form of
discounts or even rollbacks on what's being paid now,'' Dowis said.
``Our policy is that we won't pay the increased price.''
   The price hike, which went into effect June 1, was first
announced in February by Abitibi-Price Inc. of Toronto, the world's
second-largest newsprint maker behind Fletcher Challenge of New
Zealand.
   It is the first since an industrywide increase of 6.6 percent on
Jan. 1, 1988, and producers say the hike is overdue because of
declining profits that have left them struggling at the margin,
threatening mill shutdowns.
   ``Sellers have been getting killed. All the Canadians, who are
two-thirds of the North American market, are making no money
because they're selling at $525 (a ton) and that's their cost to
produce,'' said Mark Kurland, an analyst with Mabon, Nugent in New
York.
   Newsprint is now sold at about a 19 percent discount from the
list price. The increase raises actual transaction prices to about
$555-560 a metric ton from about $525.
   Newspaper companies have been stockpiling inventories of about
50 days in anticipation of a possible strike at Canadian mills,
which have already begun to cut production.
   The industry is closely watching talks that began May 31 between
Montreal-based Stone Consolidated Inc. and the Canadian
Paperworkers Union, which is seeking wage increases of 8 percent a
year in each of two years.
   A strike at Stone, which would likely spread to the entire
industry, would sharply curtail supplies. It also could force the
shutdown of some Canadian mills, which already face the prospect of
a costly retooling from virgin pulp to recycled production.
   ``The increase will go through for now. If Stone settles, then
newsprint purchasers will have the upper hand and it will probably
argue against the increase holding,'' said Kurland.

<HEAD>Knoxville Newspapers To Dissolve Joint Operating Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's two newspapers decided June 8
to dissolve their joint operating agreement, ending a lawsuit filed
by the morning Knoxville News-Sentinel against the afternoon
Knoxville Journal.
   Under the JOA, the News-Sentinel provided sales, production and
distribution for the Journal. Editorial departments of the two
newspapers are separate.
   The lawsuit claimed that the Journal's owner, Persis Corp.,
violated terms of the agreement when it purchased The Daily Times
in nearby Maryville last year. Journal Editor and Publisher Gerald
Garcia was made president and publisher of The Daily Times.
   The News-Sentinel, which recently began a zoned edition in
Maryville, considered The Daily Times a direct competitor.
   The lawsuit contended that with Garcia in the dual roles, The
Daily Times would have access to the News-Sentinel's confidential
business information and trade secrets.
   The arrangement to end the JOA calls for the News-Sentinel to
pay Persis $40 million in two $20 million installments. The money
will be in lieu of payments the Journal would have received from
Dec. 31, 1991, through the scheduled end of the agreement on Dec.
31, 2005.
   The plan calls for the JOA to end in December 1991. Until then,
the News-Sentinel will continue to act as agent on some business
matters for the Journal.
   The News-Sentinel, owned by the E.W. Scripps Co., has a daily
circulation of 101,000 and a Sunday circulation of 169,000. The
Journal publishes Monday through Saturday with a circulation of
40,000.

<HEAD>Computer Use Linked to RSI Problems at Newsday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study conducted for Newsday and its
union shows there is ``significant association'' between computer
keyboard work and repetitive strain injury, one of the researchers
said June 7.
   The study, the first comprehensive survey of repetitive strain
injury in the U.S. newspaper industry, also concluded that computer
terminal use among workers at Newsday and New York Newsday
presented ``a hazard to workers' health.'' It did not quantify or
elaborate on the risks.
   The study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health and the University of Michigan found no single cause for the
injuries, Cincinnati-based NIOSH researcher Susan Burt said in a
telephone interview.
   She said several factors contribute to the risk of getting
repetitive strain injury, or RSI, including:
   _Repetitive motions, like those made while typing on a computer
keyboard.
   _Work positions, like extending the wrists up in an awkward
position in order to type.
   _Static position, caused by holding arms up in order to type.
   The study also found that how long a person worked at a keyboard
without a break and how fast they typed contributed to problems
associated with RSI. ``We do not recommend working at a keyboard
for extended periods without taking a break,'' she said. No
specific time limit was given.
   The study group included 834 workers at Newsday and New York
Newsday. They included reporters, editors, clerical and secretarial
employees who worked in the editorial, financial, advertising and
circulation departments.
   Burt said the employees were asked if they had experienced any
pain, aching numbness, tingling or burning in their hand-wrist,
elbow, shoulder and neck area within a 12-month period.
   By definition, she said the pain had to last at least a week or
occur at least once a month. They also had to have no previous
history of acute injury to the area and the pain had to have
started on their current job.
   Survey results showed that 331 of the 834 employees, or 40
percent, reported one or more symptoms in at least one of the four
regions some time within the past year.
   Burt cautioned that the results were based on self-reporting and
said NIOSH estimated they were ``twice as high than if we had done
physical examinations as well as questionnaires.''
   Of all the employees questioned, she said ``reporters appeared
to be at higher risk'' than the other workers.
   Some believed that the type of keyboard used may contribute to
RSI, but Burt said ``we found no significant difference.''
Researchers did say, however, that work stations crowded with
computers, desks, chairs and other equipment could contribute to
the problem.
   Repetitive strain injury is listed as the leading cause of
occupational illness by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
bureau said 115,400 cases of RSI were reported nationwide in 1988,
representing 48 percent of all workplace illnesses.
   The malady has been reported in a wide range of workers
including office employees, assembly-line jobs and within the
meatpacking industry.
   The study was requested by Newsday and the Graphics
Communication International Union Local 406, which represents
nearly half of the newspaper's 3,100 fulltime employees.
   Researchers recommended that Newsday establish a
labor-management committee to handle RSI problems and train
employees on how to use adjustable equipment and change their work
habits.
   Assistant Managing Editor Robert Keane said the newspaper has
already initiated those recommendations.
   John McDonald, vice president of the union's editorial unit,
said further studies may be done to show how individual work habits
and equipment contributes to RSI.
   Burt said the agency is beginning work on two more studies on
RSI at the Los Angeles Times and U.S. West, a large
telecommunications company.

<HEAD>Maxwell Negotiating for American Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell says
he is negotiating to buy an American newspaper.
   Maxwell, the chairman of Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC,
declined to name the company but said the deal would be worth
``hundreds of millions'' of dollars.
   Maxwell, whose interest in buying more papers is widely known,
made his comments to reporters June 4 after the annual meeting of
one of his companies, Berlitz International Inc., in New York.
   Industry analysts named a few papers that Maxwell could be
targeting, including the New York Daily News, owned by the Tribune
Co. of Chicago, and the Chicago Sun-Times, which the New York-based
investment firm Adler &amp; Shaykin bought from Rupert Murdoch in 1986.
   Tribune Co. spokeswoman Martha Lindeman and Leonard Shaykin, a
managing partner of Adler &amp; Shaykin, both said their companies do
not comment on rumors of negotiations.
   Maxwell owns the London Daily Mirror and recently launched The
European, an English-language newspaper distributed throughout
Europe.
   Maxwell announced last month that he planned to buy three U.S.
supermarket tabloids, Globe, National Examiner and Sun, from
Montreal-based Globe International Publishing Inc.
   His biggest acquisition to date in the United States was his
$2.6 billion purchase in 1988 of Macmillan Inc., the publishing and

<HEAD>Lawmaker Seeks Repeal of Newspaper Preservation Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Newspaper Preservation Act is fattening
publishers' wallets but eroding press freedom and the quality of
the nation's journalism, a Republican congressman says.
   ``It seems ironic that some of the very voices which call for
free market forces to work in other industries seek government
protection for creating monopolies in their own,'' said Rep. Carl
Pursell of Michigan.
   Pursell introduced a bill June 6 to repeal the 1970 law, which
allows newspapers in the same city to operate as a single business
entity while maintaining separate news staffs.
   The bill would not affect the partial mergers already in place.
But it would prohibit similar arrangements _ known as joint
operating agreements or JOAs _ in the future.
   Leaders of Citizens for an Independent Press, a national
coalition of small newspaper publishers, business and civic
leaders, endorsed Pursell's bill. They accused the large newspapers
that have entered into JOAs of sacrificing principle for profit.
   ``These crybaby billionaires have for many years enjoyed one of
the biggest and most enduring special-interest giveaways in
American history,'' said Bruce B. Brugmann, editor and publisher of
the San Francisco Bay Guardian, a weekly newspaper.
   Newspapers in 19 cities were operating under JOAs last year.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh approved two others, in Las Vegas
and York, Pa., this year.
   Some of the country's oldest and best newspapers would be out of
business without JOAs, said Joseph Ungaro, president and chief
executive officer of the Detroit Newspaper Agency. His company
administers a JOA between the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit
News.
   The Free Press' daily circulation was 629,275 in March 1989 and
rose to 639,767 by March 1990, Ungaro said.
   The News' circulation fell from 693,943 in March 1989 to 526,147
in March 1990, largely because of a decision to scale back
circulation outside the Detroit area and to make the News an
afternoon paper instead of retaining most of the previous morning
editions, Ungaro said.
   ``I'd have to say that the readers are voting with their
pocketbooks every day by buying the product,'' he said.
   Ungaro noted that Knight-Ridder, which owns the Free Press, had
indicated it would close the money-losing newspaper if the JOA were
denied.
   ``Is one paper with a monopoly better than two voices in the
community? I don't think so,'' Ungaro said.

<HEAD>Photoengravers Laid Off in Second Round of Personnel Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The second round of layoffs at the Daily News in
two weeks was unrelated to contract negotiations, an executive for
the newspaper says.
   John T. Sloan, the News' vice president of human resources, said
June 4 the laying off of 13 full-time and eight part-time
photoengravers stemmed from ``the soft newspaper economy, and
because we are overmanned in the photoengraver department.''
   Union leader Stanley Aslanian called it ``a further tightening
of the screws,'' though he agreed the cuts were permissible under
provisions of the contract.
   On May 29, the newspaper announced the layoff of 17 machinists
because of reduced advertising revenue.
   Intense negotiations have been taking place over Daily News
labor contracts that expired March 30.
   Both sides acknowledge that the survival of the News is at
stake, although the paper says it must eliminate workers and
increase productivity to survive, and the unions say the paper is
trying to decimate them en route to shutting down the paper or
selling it.

<HEAD>Papers Publish Letter to Anderson From Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lebanon's eight daily newspapers on June
7 published a letter to American journalist Terry Anderson from his
daughter, Sulome, who was born after his abduction.
   In addition to the letter in Arabic, the prestigious An-Nahar
and four other dailies printed the original English-language text
of the letter, which Sulome addressed to her father on her fifth
birthday in the hope that Anderson would be allowed to read it.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest-held Western captive among the hostages. He
did not know Arabic when the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad _ Islamic
Holy War _ kidnapped him in west Beirut March 16, 1985.
   Sulome, in the letter addressed to ``my darling daddy,'' wrote:
``Tomorrow is my birthday. I will be five years old. I know you
have never seen me.''
   ``I also have never seen you, but my mummy tells me everything
about you and how you used to call me an active little baby,'' the
letter said.
   ``I like listening to stories about you, they make me happy.
Mummy says you will soon come to us. Please come home daddy,''
Sulome's letter said.
   ``I love you daddy. I pray for you and the others every night,'
she concluded.
   Anderson and five other Americans are among the 16 Westerners
held mainly by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions in Lebanon. The
other Western captives are four Britons, two West Germans, two
Swiss workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross, an
Italian and an Irishman.

<HEAD>Judge Considering Dismissal of Secord Libel Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal district judge is considering
whether to dismiss a $38 million libel suit filed against two
journalists by Iran-Contra figure Richard V. Secord.
   Lawyer Dean Ringel told Judge George H. Revercombe on June 5
that Secord's suit against Leslie and Andrew Cockburn and the
Atlantic Monthly Press should be dismissed because no actual malice
has been proved.
   But W. Michael Kramer, attorney for the former Air Force major
general, contended the authors, in a 1988 book, falsely linked
Secord to narcotics trafficking said to have been carried out as
part of the effort to finance the Contra rebels.
   Kramer asked the judge for additional time to take depositions
and search for further evidence in the case.
   Revercombe took both motions under advisement.
   Kramer contended that the clear intent of the book, ``Out of
Control: The Story of the Reagan Administration's Secret War in
Nicaragua,'' was to exploit the Iran-Contra affair by putting the
administration and its key players in the worst possible light.
   But Ringel, appealing for dismissal, said, ``Mr. Secord seems to
assume that since the book takes a political position opposite to
that of the previous administration that is evidence of malice.''
   Secord's libel suit was filed in March 1988, the same day he was
indicted for his Iran-Contra role.
   He was sentenced to two years' probation on one of 12 original
counts after a plea bargain. But he is appealing, alleging that
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh lacked jurisdiction to prosecute
for an offense arising out of Secord's congressional Iran-Contra
testimony.

<HEAD>Newspapers Exchange Fire in Basketball Feud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers in Portland and Detroit have
gotten into the rivalry over the NBA Finals between the Trail
Blazers and the Pistons.
   ``Just what sort of place is this Portland?'' The Detroit News
asked on its editorial page June 5.
   Well, for starters, the News says, there is the cultural tone of
the Oregon city.
   ``Portland's image is pretty well captured by its mayor, Bud
Clark, a tavern owner who posed as a flasher in a promotion for the
local arts community a few years back. The poster showed Mr. Clark,
back to the camera, raincoat wide open, flashing a sculpture above
the slogan `Expose yourself to art.'''
   Portland is also a place where ``the City Council renamed the
boulevard where all the hookers hang out after Martin Luther King.''
   The Oregonian returned fire in an editorial two days later.
   ``Detroit, a French word meaning `Let's move to Houston,' was
founded by Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, who settled there when the
transmission in his canoe gave out,'' the newspaper said.
   If The Detroit News thinks Portland is boring and snooty, The
Oregonian thinks Detroit may be too exciting for its own good.
   ``The last time the Detroit Tigers won a World Series, in 1984,
Detroit's major league fans celebrated by setting the city on
fire,'' The Oregonian said. ``The National Guard complained, but
city planners thought it was a good idea.''

<HEAD>Newspaper, Judge Battle Over List of Jurors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public and press have the right to a list of
jurors' names, even if those jurors, fearing the revenge of a
defendant they sent to jail, ask that their identities remain
secret, The Boston Globe argued June 6 before the 1st Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals.
   A former U.S. solicitor general countered that while a judge
cannot halt the ``obnoxious and harmful'' process by which jurors
become media personalities, he does not have to make the reporter's
job any easier.
   The Globe challenged a ruling last April by U.S. District Court
Judge Edward F. Harrington, who withheld the names of jurors in a
money laundering case.
   In briefs filed in support of the case, the newspaper held that
the jurors are acting in a public role when they render a verdict
and that the public has a historical right to know who they are.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney F. Dennis Saylor IV also argued for the
names to be released, in an appearance against the presiding judge
that Senior Circuit Judge Frank Coffin termed ``highly unusual.''
Saylor told the appeals court the U.S. government did not consider
the security of the jurors in the case threatened.
   Former U.S. Solicitor General Charles Fried, arguing on
Harrington's behalf, said the judge was under no obligation to
provide the list. Reporters were free to corner jurors on their way
out of the courtroom if they could, he said.
   But a judge, Fried argued, has the right to say, ```I'm not
going to make (the reporter's) job easier. I cannot stop it, I
cannot shut it down, but I will not facilitate it.' That is the
heart of this case.''
   The money laundering case involved alleged members of organized
crime, and one of the defendants was still at large at the time of
the trial. Jurors in the case had asked that their names not be
disclosed because they feared retribution by the defendants.

   Partsch said June 5 he was holding 30 to 40 pages of Soviet

   ``It's the first time I've ever seen this,'' said Bob Haring,
executive editor or the Tulsa World, who received 20 to 30 pages of
faxed material from the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   The Soviets say it's nothing unusual, just another embassy using
technology to reach the media.
   ``We're using modern know-how to reach newspapers. If,
politically, countries are changing, why should information
agencies work in the same manner, the old manner?'' said Alexander
Malyshkin, senior information officer for the Soviet Embassy.
   ``American media is very fast, you know,'' he said.
   Malyshkin said his office has one fax machine and aides work
constantly to relay articles by the official Novosti Press Agency,
opinion pieces by Soviet officials and even lighthearted features
on life in the Soviet republics.
   But if calls to a handful of newspapers are any indication,
there may be more openness than the American media can handle.

   Most Americans would welcome cable television
competition, according to a Gallup Poll released June 4 by one of
the telephone companies eager to get into the business.
   A majority of those surveyed also said they would like to have
two-way video services _ such as movies on demand, library services
and office-in-the-home services _ that could be provided through a
network of high-capacity, fiber-optic telephone lines.
   ``This is a clear indication that the public would favor
competition and innovation,'' said Kent B. Foster, president of GTE
Telephone Operations, which commissioned the study.
   The poll results were released as congressional committees,
beset by constituent complaints of high prices and poor service,
consider legislation to re-regulate the cable industry.
   A proposal by Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., would lift some
provisions of the 1984 Cable Act that prohibit companies such as
GTE from providing video programming within their telephone service
areas.
   Other federal laws prohibit the seven regional Bell companies
from selling cable TV programming.
   The poll was conducted April 30-May 2 by telephone with 1,000

   _Allow local governments to regulate prices for a ``basic tier''
of channels including local over-the-air broadcast channels.
Ad-supported pay cable channels such as ESPN, CNN and MTV would not
be subject to local rate regulation. However, if local authorities
or a subscriber complains about rate increases for such
ad-supported cable channels, the FCC could establish ``reasonable
rates'' if it finds them to be excessive.
   _Require cable operators not to discriminate against cable
programmers like movie channels with which they have no
affiliation. Some cable companies are owned by giant conglomerates
that also own movie channels.
   _Require that all cable programmers make their programming
available to home dish owners.

<HEAD>Turner Promises Apology for Religion Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner has promised to
apologize for calling Christianity ``a religion for losers'' when
he speaks at a church luncheon, the church pastor says.
   ``He made the statement he wants a chance to apologize to the
world, but would say other things we might not like,'' said the
Rev. Johnny Hunt of the 3,500-member First Baptist Church of
Woodstock.
   Hunt said Turner initiated the idea for the June 13 luncheon at
the suburban Atlanta church, where a former girlfriend and a
fishing buddy are members.
   Turner criticized Christians last year and again last month at
the National Convention of the American Humanist Association when
he was named Humanist of the Year.
   Hunt speculated that maybe Turner ``hasn't met the right ones.''

<HEAD>Lobbyists' Ranks Grow But Most States Lack Oversight on Their
Activities</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Logo, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More lobbyists than ever are swarming through state
legislatures, spending more money than ever before to influence
lawmakers.
   But a 50-state look at lobbyists by The Associated Press found
few states effectively monitor their activities. Rules regulating
lobbyists are riddled with loopholes, and the legislators who make
those rules receive lobbyists' campaign contributions, meals and
gifts.
   In most states it is virtually impossible to know how much
lobbyists are spending and which legislators they spend it on.
   ``Money buys access, and access buys a higher degreee of
success,'' said Chuck Sauvage of the Washington state branch of
Common Cause, which itself lobbies for more accountability by those
who make and influence legislation.
   ``We're in danger of seeing government of the special interests,
by the special interests and for the special interests.''
   The growth in the number of lobbyists comes at a time when the
responsibility for funding social welfare programs is shifting from
Congress to the states, and legislatures are tackling such complex
issues as the environment, abortion, gun control, smoking
restrictions and car insurance.
   Pick any aspect of life and there is apt to be a lobbyist for or
against it.
   Lobbyists represent baby doctors and undertakers; insurers and
the lawyers who sue for claims; environmentalists and companies who
bury toxic waste; gun control groups and the National Rifle
Association; health care providers and tobacco and liquor
interests; churches and casinos; corporations and unions; farmers
and bankers; the media and local governments.
   Lobbyists persuade lawmakers to pass, kill or amend laws to
benefit the special interest that hired them. They have a
constitutional right to air their side, and they are an important
source of analysis and expertise for understaffed legislatures that
were created as citizen assemblies.
   Lobbyists get little mention in civics lessons. Yet leaving out
lobbyists from the way a bill becomes a law is like having a road
map with only interstate highways. They are the access ramps, back
roads, shortcuts, cutoffs and detours.
   Lobbyists outnumber lawmakers nearly 6-to-1. The AP survey found
more than 42,500 registered lobbyists at state capitols, an
increase of 20 percent from the Council of State Government's
registry four years ago when Ronald Reagan was in office.
   ``That new federalism Mr. Reagan gave us didn't necessarily mean
less government; it sort of meant a change of address,'' said
Roland Luedtke, a former lawmaker and lieutenant governor in
Nebraska.
   Lawmakers insist they do not sell votes while lobbyists say they
do not buy them. Indeed, examples of outright bribery are rare, but
critics say the system is so ambiguous that wrongdoing becomes a
matter of perception.
   ``It's ripe for abuse. There's the potential for corruption and
undue influence,'' said Kirby Hendee, a retired lobbyist and former
state senator in Wisconsin. ``People have got to get mad.
Somebody's stealing the heart of government and they don't seem
excited about it.''
   Some point to campaign contributions as the most corrosive
influence.
   ``It's a form of bribery. It's not cash under the table, but
it's the equivalent of cash,'' said Florida Sen. Tom Brown. ``The
public perception is that if you take things you're obligated to
them. It's patently absurd to think otherwise.''
   What do the persuaders get for their money?
   ``Access. It's access, the kind of access the typical voter
doesn't have,'' said Pennsylvania Rep. Allen Kukovich. ``If they
get on the phone or make an appointment, snap, they want to get in
there. They want your ear. This is America. Money talks. Money buys
access.
   ``I can't honestly say anyone's for sale. I think there are some
members who are for lease,'' Kukovich said. ``I don't think
lobbyists are bad. The problem is, I think, they have too much
influence.''
   How much lobbyists spend and how they spend it causes the most
alarm among those who feel special interests dominate legislatures.
   For example, the day after lobbyists for Alamo Rent A Car
treated 27 members of Florida's House Rules Committee to a dinner
of steak, red snapper and conch chowder last year, the panel voted
Alamo's way and killed a proposal to limit how much rental car
companies charge for collision damage waivers.
   This year, Florida-based Alamo won a victory in the House
Insurance Committee. It rejected a bill that would have forced car
companies to charge less for refueling cars.
   Before the vote, at least 12 of the 17 lawmakers on the panel
got $9,000 in campaign contributions _ all legal _ from rental car
interests. Chairman Peter Deutsch got $1,000 each from Alamo and
Hertz, which were on opposing sides.
   Alamo also provided free use of a Buick for four days to Rep.
Steve Geller, chairman of the House Insurance Subcommittee, who
voted Alamo's way. Geller said accepting the car was a
misunderstanding and he paid for it after his using it became
public.
   Car companies and lawmakers said no votes were bought or sold,
but Kevin Bloom of the Florida Consumer Action Network said the two
actions were revealing.
   ``It's one example of special interests like Alamo using
affluence to influence the outcome of legislative matters,'' Bloom
said. ``There's no way you can take gifts, or favors or anything of
value and not be influenced.''
   The AP examination of lobbyists found a hodgepodge of laws
regulating them and their spending activities. Campaign
contributions and gifts that are perfectly legal in some states
would bring criminal censure in others. Most of the laws were
written by lawmakers; only a handful of states have regulations
enacted by voters.
   Four states don't require lobbyists to report what they spend
trying to influence legislators. Lobbyists in the other states
rarely have to identify the lawmakers they wine and dine or give
gifts to.
   State governments spend little to monitor lobbying, ranging from
about $750,000 in California to an estimated $400 in Oklahoma.
Twenty-three states devote only one or a part-time staffer to
oversight.
   A century ago, Massachusetts made the first attempt at making
special interests accountable by requiring a detailed statement of
all expenses and registration of those working for special
interests.
   Only one state, Wisconsin, forbids lawmakers from accepting a
gift, trip, meal, or anything of value _ even a cup of coffee _
from a lobbyist. But even it allows special interests to make
campaign contributions.
   All states require lobbyists to register, but four _ Georgia,
Louisiana, Utah and Wyoming _ don't require any reports on what
they spend. The rules in most of the rest are written so lobbyists
generally can report only their overall spending and don't have to
identify individual legislators on whom money is spent.
   Of the 46 states that require some degree of reporting of
lobbyists' spending, 29 do not audit the reports for accuracy and
merely try to make sure the reports are filed on time. Twenty-eight
of the 46 conducted no investigations of the previous reporting
period.
   In a typical comment, McDonald T. Coker, assistant director of
Delaware's Legislative Council, said of his state's law: ``There is
no accounting system. ... The law is so loose you couldn't catch
anyone if you wanted to.''

   Almost as revealing as what some lobbyists report is what they
don't.
   Last year, California had an estimated $90 million reported
spent by lobbyists.
   Yet in a loophole-ridden state like Pennsylvania, lobbyists as a
group reported spending $362,000. That's a fraction of what was
reported in smaller states like Connecticut, Montana, Mississippi,
Hawaii, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Kentucky and
Kansas. The top lobbyist in at least five states reported spending
more than was reported by Pennsylvania's 799 lobbyists combined.
   Many former elected officials have found second careers as
lobbyists; among ex-governors representing special interest groups
are Marvin Mandel of Maryland and Anthony Earl and Martin Schreiber
of Wisconsin.
   Some of the best paid lobbyists make six-figure incomes that are
several times greater than even the highest paid legislators. In
Maryland, for instance, lobbyist Bruce Bereano got more than $1
million in fees from 53 clients in 1989.
   The persuaders, not surprisingly, aren't in favor of more
reporting.
   ``Requiring a lobbyist to report doesn't make them honest or
dishonest. No lobbyist is going to report doing something
illegal,'' said Hobson Waits, a lobbyist for the Electric Power
Associations of Mississippi Inc.
   Watchdogs agree, but they say the point is the public interest
would be best served if special interests reported in detail what
they do to influence legislators.
   ``We've cut the average citizen out of the process,'' said Barry
Kauffman of Pennsylvania Common Cause.
   ``It's the contemporary golden rule: Those with the gold make
the rules,'' Kauffman said. ``People are turned off. They've passed
apathy and gone to alienation. It's not their system anymore.''

   Lobbyists' largess to legislators has often upset citizens, but
cases rarely have wound up in court in recent years.
   California Sen. Joseph Montoya was convicted in February of
selling votes to special interests who were actually undercover
federal agents. He was found guilty of racketeering, money
laundering and five counts of extortion for demanding campaign
contributions and speaking fees in exchange for votes.
   Last year, federal prosecutors in West Virginia won convictions
or guilty pleas from two former Senate presidents, a Senate
majority leader, a member of the House of Delegates, two lobbyists
and a Senate aide in vote-buying cases.
   In Wisconsin, two dozen legislators and lobbyists violated the
state's ethics law last year by accepting or offering meals, hotel
rooms, tickets to sporting events or travel expenses. Wisconsin is
the only state that bars legislators from accepting _ or lobbyists
from giving them _ anything of value, even a soft drink.
   Eighteen of the cases involved inadvertent or minor infractions,
but Sen. William Shoemaker pleaded guilty after he was charged with
accepting illegal loans from a lobbyist and stealing money from his
campaign committee. Shoemaker resigned his seat and served 60 days
in jail.

   Chicken magnate Lonnie ``Bo'' Pilgrim came
to the Capitol last July to argue for changes he wanted made in the
workmen's compensation program.
   While he was at it, he handed out $10,000 checks to eight of the
31 Texas senators.
   Pilgrim said it was just a way to get access to the senators so
they'd listen to his case. ``All it does is they will answer a
telephone call or give you an appointment to listen, to hear
issues,'' he said.
   One senator returned his check before reporters learned of them,
and the others followed suit after news reports triggered a public
outcry.
   Travis County District Attorney Ronnie Earle called the handouts
``outrageous'' but apparently legal. It wasn't a bribe under Texas
law if reported as a campaign contribution.
   ``This is not a simple area of the law. It's not like somebody
going to a 7-Eleven and saying, `Stick 'em up.' It's much more
complicated,'' Earle said.

   Americans believe state lawmakers regularly swap
their votes for payoffs, and they favor strict regulation of
political lobbying to curtail such influence peddling, a national
poll has found.
   By overwhelming majorities, respondents to the Media
General-Associated Press poll said state legislators are overly
influenced by gifts or campaign contributions from lobbyists, and
they favored banning such favors.
   Half the respondents, furthermore, said lawmakers are more
interested in raising money for their re-election than in passing
good laws. Nine in 10 favored limiting the amount candidates can
spend to run for state office.
   Nearly two-thirds of the 1,071 adults polled expressed negative
views of the ethical behavior of state lawmakers. An even stronger
majority, 74 percent, rated lobbyists' ethical performance as
``only fair'' or ``poor.''
   Lobbyists pervade the lawmaking process, representing
businesses, unions and other organizations that have an interest in
proposed laws. They seek, through information and persuasion, to
draw legislators to their view.
   Lobbyists work at all levels of government, although much
attention is focused on their efforts in Washington. The survey
sought to gauge public awareness of lobbying at the state level.
   It found that statehouse lobbying is widely recognized _ and
largely criticized. Nearly half the respondents said lobbyists have
``a great amount'' of influence in shaping state laws, yet only a
quarter believed the information supplied by lobbyists to lawmakers
is reliable.
   Fully half expressed an unfavorable opinion of lobbyists and
said their influence in shaping laws is too great, the poll found.
That criticism of lobbyists rose among the most educated
respondents.
   Support for new lobbying regulations was overwhelming: Eight in
10 said they would back a disclosure law ``requiring lobbyists to
publicly report all contacts they have with state lawmakers.''
   Even more, nearly nine in 10, said it should be illegal for
lobbyists to give gifts to state lawmakers; three-quarters said
lobbyists should be banned from making political campaign
contributions; and two-thirds said lobbyists should be barred from
paying for legislators' meals.
   Few such restrictions are currently in place.
   No state requires lobbyists to report all their contacts with
state legislators. Nor does any state ban lobbyists from making
campaign contributions _ that would be an infrigement of their
constitutional right to participate in the political process. Only
one state _ Wisconsin _ prohibits legislators from accepting gifts
or meals from legislators.
   The support for restrictions appeared to stem from concern over
the effect of favors from lobbyists. Eighty-three percent said
lawmakers are overly influenced by campaign contributions from
lobbyists, and 75 percent said gifts from lobbyists create undue
influence.
   In an even more damning assessment, respondents saw some forms
of influence peddling as commonplace. Eight in 10 said lawmakers
sometimes vote the way lobbyists want them to in exchange for gifts
from the lobbyists, and nearly nine in 10 said lawmakers sometimes
vote the way some organization wants them to in order to get
campaign contributions from that organization.
   About six in 10 said they believe such incidents happen either
``most of the time'' or ``a good part of the time.''
   The concern over lobbying and its effect on lawmaking spanned
the political spectrum, with similar shares of respondents in
accord regardless of ideology or party affiliation.
   Many lawmakers complain that the cost of political campaigns
makes them devote considerable time to fund-raising, and the poll
found a broad public perception that fund-raising is paramount to
politicians.
   It asked, ``Which of these do you think is more important to
most state lawmakers _ passing good laws, or raising money for
their next re-election campaign?'' Fifty-one percent said
fund-raising came first, and an additional 7 percent were unsure.
   Eighty-nine percent favored limits on the amount of money
candidates can spend to run for state office. But just six in 10 of
that group backed some form of public funding for political
campaigns, even though courts have ruled that spending cannot be
limited unless public financing is provided.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points. It was conducted Sept. 14-24, when most state legislatures
were out of session. That time was selected to avoid having
opinions on current legislative action influence more general views
on legislators and lobbyists.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews Sept. 14-24, 1989, with 1,071 adults
in the continental United States. Phone numbers were selected
randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult who had the
most recent birthday, a random phenomenon.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of
20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if
every adult American were asked the same questions. The error
margin is larger for subgroups.
   There are other sources of potential error in polls, including
the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this
poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:

<HEAD>Legislative Appetizer: Entertaining Is Like `Wrench to the
Plumber'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Business people know the value of entertaining their clients
over a few drinks and a sumptuous meal in a relaxed setting. It's a
cost of forging working relationships.
   And no one does it better than the special interests influencing
state legislators in the 50 state capitols. Wining and dining goes
with lobbying as easily as gin mixes with vermouth.
   ``The entertainment with legislators is the most important part
of our business. It is the wrench to the plumber,'' said New Mexico
lobbyist Edwin T. Mahr. He estimated 80 percent of the $1 million
his firm spent in 1987-89 went for such entertainment.
   Lobbyists and lawmakers insist votes aren't exchanged for meals,
but critics say special interests get special attention at the
expense of the public interest.
   In a 50-state look at lobbying, The Associated Press found a
crazy-quilt of laws that lacks significant oversight and fails to
give an accurate national picture of how much special interests
spend on entertaining and which lawmakers they spend it on.
   Getting to know the people who pass, change or kill legislation
is vital for lobbyists hoping to persuade them to take the side of
their special interest.
   ``There could be nothing worse for a lobbyist than not to be
recognized,'' said Melvin Cooper, executive director of the Alabama
Ethics Commission.
   ``They're selling ideas, just like somebody else is selling a
car,'' said Jan Konesey of Delaware Common Cause, a group that
itself lobbies for laws to make government more open to public
view. ``When lobbyists go out to dinner with legislators or play
golf with them or take them to a football game, you're just
building relationships that make you a better salesman.''
   Whether those contacts go too far is another matter. And voters
have little to go on other than the word of legislators and
lobbyists that there isn't undue influence.
   Four states require no reporting by lobbyists of their spending
at all, and only 31 of the remaining 46 require lobbyists to break
down spending into categories such as entertainment.
   However, the 31 states have thresholds whereby a lawmaker being
entertained doesn't have to be identified unless the amount spent
is above a set amount. In Arizona, for example, lobbyists don't
have to list separate expenses if they spend less then $25 for each
issue they discuss with a legislator. So a lobbyist could buy a
lawmaker a $74 meal and not have to disclose it if they talked
about three issues.
   ``The people who get hurt are those who are not at the table,
and that's usually the taxpayer. There is this insider's game that
is almost exclusionary of the public,'' said Chuck Sauvage of
Common Cause in Washington state, which itself lobbies for more
accountability by those who make and influence laws.
   Some states are considering tighter rules.
   On June 6, California voters overwhelmingly passed an
ethics-in-government measure. Among other things, it prohibits
lawmakers from accepting speaking fees and requires the legislature
to bar or strictly limit gifts to elected officials
   And the public in general has strong opinions about
accountability.
   In a Media General-Associated Press poll, 75 percent of 1,071
adults across the nation said gifts from lobbyists create undue
influence. Eight in 10 said lawmakers sometimes vote the way
lobbyists want them to in exchange for gifts.
   Eight in 10 said they would back a disclosure law requiring
lobbyists to publicly report all contacts they have with state
lawmakers.
   Contacts pay off, Nebraska Sen. Ernie Chambers contends.
   ``There have always been those senators who have gone to the
trough with a glad heart _ the free meals, the free booze and the
free whatever else they could get,'' Chambers said. ``And then they
say that this is just business, that it doesn't buy their vote or
influence them unduly. Bull!''
   Florida Rep. Ron Glickman said: ``Lobbyists have natural
advantages because they have things members want _ financial
contributions and gifts. It may not be direct trade, but there's a
feeling of good will. When an issue comes up for a vote. They'll
say: `We helped you. It's time for you to help.'''
   Lobbyists do expect something in return for their hospitality,
even if it's not an outright exchange, said Kirby Hendee, a retired
lobbyist and former state senator in Wisconsin.
   ``If you buy a guy enough meals and buy him enough drinks, he's
going to vote your way over time. You can't repeal human nature,''
Hendee said.
   The special interests decry the notion that the way to a
lawmaker's vote is through his stomach.
   ``If you can buy him for a steak and a martini, he wasn't worth
the time of having dinner with,'' said Victor Condello, a partner
in a New York lobbying firm that makes more than $1 million
annually.
   But lobbyists who don't have deep pockets appreciate the value
of wining and dining.
   ``The problem is access if you can't afford to wine and dine.
One feels lost,'' said Phil Kaplan, who lobbies on behalf of the
poor in Olympia, Wash.
   And access is the name of the game.
   ``To me, access is the most important thing in the world,'' said
John Larson, chairman of the California Fair Political Practices
Commission. ``My God, you give me two hours with the president of
the United States, that's all the access I would need!''
   Not all entertaining is done at the dinner table.
   In New Mexico, lobbyist Truett Gill spent $300 to stock snack
items for House leaders in 1989.
   Utah's 29 senators and their families were invited to spend a
free weekend at the Deer Valley ski resort last year, and most them
accepted, while considering a tax exemption for capital
improvements at ski areas. The first attempt to pass the bill
failed, although a modified version later passed.
   Florida has a lobbyist known as the ``beer fairy.'' A legislator
announces he wants to have a party, and someone leaves cases of
beer anonymously at the doorstep.
   Florida lawmakers and their families also are offered a free
trip to Disney World every year, at a cost of $200 to $2,000 per
lawmaker. Lawmakers recently passed a bill to prohibit customers
from selling unused entrance tickets to the theme park, but House
Rules Chairman Fred Lippman said the trip had no bearing on his
vote.
   ``Mickey, Minnie and Goofy sure as hell don't convince us what
to do with Disney World,'' Lippman said.

<HEAD>Remodeler-Renovator Bob Vila is `Home Again' on TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Vila got kicked out of the ``House'' and
decided to go ``Home.''
   For 10 years, Vila was host of ``This Old House,'' the
highest-rated show on public television, teaching viewers home
renovation and remodeling techniques. Then he was fired for making
too many commercials.
   This fall, he'll be back on the job _ on commercial TV.
   ``The new show is aptly named `Home Again' because, in many
ways, it puts me back on TV where I started 10, 11 years ago,''
Vila said from BVTV, his production company in Massachusetts. ``I'm
doing construction and remodeling stories that are relevant to the
remodeling homeowner and home builder.''
   That wasn't the case on the Emmy Award-winning ``This Old
House,'' which spared no expense when it undertook costly
renovation projects, he said.
   ``I'm sure our viewers were entertained and pleased to watch
some of the costly jobs that we did, but I could not relate to
thousand-dollar toilets and other gilded lilies,'' Vila said.
   ``It's always ironic that people in public television have that
money-is-no-object attitude,'' he said.
   With 15 million viewers, ``This Old House'' made Vila a
celebrity among do-it-yourselfers. He cashed in with a string of TV
commercials for Time-Life Books and various home improvement
products.
   That grated on his show's corporate underwriters and on Boston's
WGBH-TV, which produced the show. The underwriters saw Vila
speaking for the competition. WGBH said Vila was hurting public
TV's image.
   To put it kindly, he was nailed.
   ``It was tough for me for three months,'' said Vila, who found a
new sponsor in Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   ``Home Again,'' syndicated by Group W, will air starting in
September in 85 percent of the country, including on network
affiliate stations in 24 of the top 25 television markets.
   ``As far as public television is concerned, I gave them 10 great
years of my life,'' Vila said. ``I feel like I've done my duty for
public TV.''
   He still is a commercial spokesman for Time-Life Books, and
he'll appear for Sears' line of Craftsman tools and home
improvement supplies. But his other commercial ties, Vila said,
have lapsed.
   ``Home Again'' will have a distinctly different flavor from
``This Old House,'' which continues on PBS.
   Vila and co-producer Michael Ferrone, a former developer, made
13 episodes of ``Home Again'' building a house on Cape Cod for $50
a square foot.
   In the Northeast, $60 to $80 a square foot is reasonable, Vila
said. For fancy remodeling jobs featured in magazine layouts, he
said, the cost is probably $100 a square foot.
   Vila said they kept costs down ``by doing drywall instead of
skim-coat plaster, pine flooring instead of oak, by approaching
everything with the budget in mind.''
   Instead of master carpenter Norm Abrams, who remains on PBS,
Vila has a new sidekick in carpenter Bob Ryley of Brewster, Mass.
   ``It's a happy circumstance, because I didn't think he'd be as
good before the camera as he is a carpenter,'' Vila said. ``He has
a pixie Irish quality that comes out nicely on the tube.''
   The season's final 13 episodes will cover the renovation of a
two-story ``graystone'' in the Wicker Park section of Chicago,
which won't be confused with the affluent middle-class
neighborhoods of ``This Old House.''
   ``The neighborhood is certainly one that's in transition,'' Vila
said. ``It's a wonderful mix of Polish, American blacks and
Hispanics.''
   Whether there's a second season, Vila said, will depend on the
audience and the critics. But he said he's not going to worry about
the future.
   ``I just feel like I'm home again with a better chance for an
audience,'' he said.

<HEAD>Finnish Bass Looms Large on Opera Scene</HEAD>

   ``Brooding,'' ``hulking,'' ``towering,''
``fearsome,'' ``wonderfully cavernous,'' ``superbly sinister,''
``frighteningly big and mean.''
   These are some of the terrible things opera critics like to say
about Finnish bass Matti Salminen. Their words apply as well to his
giant-size voice as to his menacing, 6-foot-5 figure.
   ``When I was young, my voice was smaller and more lyrical,''
Salminen, 45, said in a recent interview. ``But I studied and
worked hard and it grew.''
   That's an understatement, as anyone can attest who has heard his
thundering tones easily penetrate the 4,000-seat Metropolitan Opera
House.
   He was much in evidence there this spring, singing in all four
operas of Wagner's `Ring Cycle.'' He was the greedy giant Fafner in
``Das Rheingold''; the cuckolded husband, Hunding, in ``Die
Walkuere''; Fafner again in ``Siegfried,'' this time transformed
into a sleeping dragon who is first awakened and then slain by the
title character, expiring to music that is ``so beautiful, just
like a Schubert song''; and the villainous Hagen who gives
Siegfried and Bruennhilde a rough time of it in ``Die
Goetterdaemmerung.''
   The last role is by far the biggest and most challenging.
   ``Hagen's personality is vicious from the ground up, but he is
one of the most interesting characters in the whole `Ring,'''
Salminen said. ``Even though he doesn't appear in the earlier
operas, his appearance is being built up to from the start.''
   Hagen is the illegitimate son of Alberich, the dwarf whose theft
of gold from the Rhinemaidens causes all the trouble to begin with.
Alberich loses his treasure to Wotan, king of the gods, and spends
the rest of the cycle scheming to get it back. Where the cringing,
cowardly father fails, the daring, dastardly son almost succeeds.
   ``From Alberich's weakness, all of a sudden comes a strong
figure,'' Salminen said. ``He manipulates everyone; he has
incredible slyness.''
   Salminen plays Hagen to the hilt. His voice brims with malice as
he plots to ruin the heroic lovers and insinuates his way into
their confidence. The pleasure he takes in his own scheming is
evident from the gleam in his eye and the way he struts about the
stage. It's a performance that has earned him unanimous raves from
the reviewers.
   His Hagen will be one of the highlights of the Public
Broadcasting Service's telecast of the Met's ``Ring Cycle''
production on four consecutive nights, June 18-21. He also will be
heard as Fafner, but Hunding will be sung by German bass Kurt Moll.
   Wagner has played a major part in Salminen's career. He first
came to international prominence in 1976 as Hunding and the giant
Fasolt at the centennial production by Patrice Chereau at Bayreuth,
West Germany.
   His Met debut was a triumph in the role of King Marke in
Wagner's ``Tristan und Isolde,'' whose 20-minute monologue usually
puts audiences to sleep. Last season he sang Daland in Wagner's
``Der Fliegende Hollaender.'' He has also performed such
non-Wagnerian parts as the comic villain Osmin in Mozart's
``Abduction From the Seraglio'' and Rocco the jailer in Beethoven's
``Fidelio.''
   Yet it rankles him that his Met career is not more varied. In
Europe, he gets to portray the title role in Mussorgsky's ``Boris
Godunov'' and Phillip II in Verdi's ``Don Carlos.'
   ``The Met tells me they really only want me for the German
repertory,'' Salminen said with a sigh. ``Here I'm allowed to sing
Ramfis (the priest in Verdi's `Aida'), but that's not much
compensation.''
   Salminen, who is married and has two children, has a home in
Zurich, Switzerland, and also one in Helsinki, Finland.
   He grew up in the town of Turko, where at age 17 he won an
amateur singing contest. Four years later he was singing in the
Finnish National Opera chorus and appearing there in small roles
such as Charles V in ``Don Carlos'' and Monterone in ``Rigoletto.''
In 1969, he went to Rome to study with vocal coach Luigi Ricci, and
his career took off in the early 1970s.
   He is just one of several Finnish singers who have made names
for themselves abroad in recent years. Others include baritone
Jorma Hynninen, soprano Karita Mattila and the late bass Martti
Talvela, whom Salminen mourns as ``a father figure to all us
Finnish singers.''
   Salminen said part of the reason they were driven to seek
international careers was the lack of a Finnish opera house
suitable for major productions.
   ``In a country of 5 million people, we have had only one tiny
house that with great trouble could squeeze maybe six or eight
violins into the orchestra pit,'' he said. ``So if you wanted to do
something, you had to go outside.''
   He now sings every summer at the Savonlinna Festival in Finland
and looks forward to being involved with a new national opera house
scheduled to open in Helsinki in 1993.
   He will not appear at the Met next season but will be back in
1991-92 for Ramfis, Daland, Rocco, Osmin and the Commendatore in
Mozart's ``Don Giovanni.''

   In exchange, Trump has pledged as collateral some of his

   Another key vacancy looms in Chrysler Corp.'s
dwindling executive ranks after Bennett Bidwell, the outspoken head
of car- and truck-making operations, said he will step down at the
end of the year.
   Bidwell on Monday confirmed weeks of speculation about his
tenure by announcing his plan to retire effective Jan. 1, 1991, at
the age of 63.
   ``After 37 years in the automotive business,'' he said, ``I
think it is time to stop worrying about 10-day sales reports. I'm
in reasonably good health, but it's time to decelerate a little.''
   Company spokesman Tom Houston said it was too soon to name
Bidwell's successor.
   The departure of Chrysler's most colorful executive next to
Chairman Lee Iacocca further drains the company's executive pool,
which has suffered three other departures in the past six weeks.
   Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald left Chrysler May 30 to head a
three-union bid to buy United Airlines for $4.54 billion. Michael
Hammes, vice president for international operations, left earlier
in May to head Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s toolmaking operation.
   Chrysler Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman has said he plans to
leave this summer.
   Because of those departures and Bidwell's expected retirement,
Iacocca said late last week he would stay on past the Dec. 8, 1991,
expiration of his four-year contract. It is unclear how long
Iacocca will remain chairman and chief executive officer.
   The executive exodus has left few in line for Iacocca's job. The
main contenders are Robert S. Miller, who took over Greenwald's
title and many of his duties, and Robert Lutz, who assumed a few of
Greenwald's responsibilities but had no change in his title of
president of Chrysler Motors.
   The departures come as Chrysler struggles to recapture profit
and market share.
   The company earned $71 million in the first quarter of this
year, down 80 percent from a year ago, and is believed to have lost
money on its core auto-making operations. Analysts don't expect any
significant earnings improvement until the fourth quarter of this
year.
   Last October, Chrysler began a $1.5 billion cost-cutting
program, which included a reduction in the white-collar work force
of about 2,500 people.
   At the end of last month, Chrysler's share of the U.S. car
market stood at 8.3 percent, down from 9.6 percent a year earlier.
Its share of the light truck market slipped to 20.4 percent from
21.6 percent.
   The financial problems have led to speculation that Chrysler
could become the target of a takeover offer or stake purchase by
some overseas automaker, such as Fiat SpA of Italy or Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. of Japan.

<HEAD>Damage in Asia Seen from US-Mexico Free Trade</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A free-trade pact between the United States
and Mexico should spur an increase in investment in Mexico and make
the country a potent competitor to the newly industrialized
countries of Asia, analysts said.
   Figures recently issued by the U.S. Department of Labor showed
that in 1987, the most recent year for which overall figures were
available, it cost manufacturers $1.57 an hour to hire a worker in
Mexico. That compared with $1.79 in South Korea, $2.12 in Hong
Kong, $2.31 in Singapore and $13.40 in this country.
   In addition to low wages, Mexico's proximity to the United
States gives it an advantage over Asian and European competitors in
lower transport costs, said Nora Lustig, a former consultant to the
Mexican government and a visiting fellow at the Brookings
Institution.
   She said she expected to see more industry develop in northern
Mexico, near the U.S. border. She saw textiles and electronics as
two areas where Mexico has much to offer investors.
   Ms. Lustig and Ernest L. Preeg, a former State Department trade
specialist who holds a chair in international business at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said prospects of a
free-trade pact would pay immediate psychological dividends even if
a treaty takes time to iron out.
   Investment is likely to increase as business people are
reassured by the prospect of steady sales in the huge U.S. market
for the Mexican goods, they said.
   In addition to U.S. and Canadian investors, companies in other
industrial countries will want to start manufacturing in a place
where costs are low and restrictions will be few on sales to the
United States, Preeg said. Confidence stemming from free-trade
prospects also could bring home some of the tens of billions of
dollars wealthy Mexicans have stashed abroad, he said.
   The two analysts saw broad advantages for both Mexico and the
United States from a free-trade agreement. The two countries want
to see more jobs created in Mexico so more Mexicans will stay at
home instead of migrating, legally or illegally, to the United
States.
   Ms. Lustig said a treaty would give U.S. companies a chance to
boost sales of machinery to equip the new factories in Mexico, and
the possibility of making products such as auto parts more cheaply
than at home.
   Not everyone sees the prospects so favorably. Last week Lane
Kirkland, head of the AFL-CIO, and Shirley Carr, head of the
Canadian Labor Congress, foresaw more unemployment in the United
States and Canada from a U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement.
   The Council on Henispheric Affairs, another private study group,
predicted that foreign companies would exploit Mexican labor and
invest their earnings in other countries.

   ``Adam Smith's Money World,'' public
television's weekly look at business, will be shown this fall on
Soviet television, dubbed in Russian, according to The New York
Times.
   The export of the show produced by Alvin H. Perlmutter Inc. and
public TV station WNET appears to be another example of the
Soviets' increased acceptance of capitalism. American shows are
rarely found on Soviet TV.
   ``Adam Smith has come to the land of Karl Marx,'' said the
show's host, referring to his namesake, the 18th-century Scottish
economist who formulated the theories of capitalism.
   In interviews published Tuesday, the show's host, whose real
name is George J.W. Goodman, and his Soviet colleagues said much of
the information presented on the program would be beyond the
typical Soviet viewer's comprehension.
   ``I think there's enormous confusion because the signals aren't
clear there as they go to a market economy.''
   Co Star, a Soviet joint venture company that produces and
distributes films, will get the broadcast rights to ``Money
World,'' and will sell 90 seconds of advertising to U.S. companies
doing business in the Soviet Union. Those companies include General
Motors and AT&amp;T.
   In return, the show's U.S. producers will get technical support
for a public television special on perestroika and glasnost, as
well as for segments of ``Adam Smith's Money World.''
   Goodman said talks with Co Star began last year when he was
planning the hourlong special on perestroika and glasnost.
   No money is being exchanged in the deal, the Times said.
   ``Money World'' is underwritten by the Metropolitan Life
Insurance and Unisys companies, the Times said.

<HEAD>Amid Takeover Rumors, Foxboro Exploring Possible `Alliance'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foxboro Co., a leading international maker of
manufacturing control systems, says it is looking at what it termed
an ``alliance'' with other firms that could include the sale of the
company.
   The announcement Monday came amid speculation that began last
week about a possible takeover of Foxboro. The talk drove up
Foxboro's stock, which closed Monday at $30 a share, up $1.50, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
   A week ago the stock sold for $24 a share. Last year it traded
as low as $18.62{, said Albert Turner, a securities analyst at Duff
&amp; Phelps in Chicago.
   Foxboro systems are used to record and control processes in
manufacturing such as temperature, pressure, humidity and liquid
levels. Its customers are largely in the chemical and petroleum
industries and include such familiar names as Exxon Corp. and Dow
Chemical Co.
   The international company, based in the suburb of Foxboro,
employs 7,000 people. The company reported a net loss for 1989 of
$4.6 million, or 37 cents a share, on sales of $598 million.
   In a brief announcement, the company said it was ``exploring
alternatives with respect to a possible strategic alliance with a
limited number of firms.''
   Such an alliance, it said, ``could add complementary strengths
to the company's existing strong process control capability.''
   The deal it is exploring, the company added, ``could involve an
equity investment in all or a substantial portion of its stock.''
   It also said, however, that no decision had been made on whether
such a deal might even transpire.
   Telephone calls to John C. Fuller, a member of the Foxboro board
and a vice president for investor relations, were not returned.
   Foxboro would be an attractive buy, Turner said. Among its
attributes are an old and loyal customer base and a new product
line first offered two years ago that enables Foxboro systems to be
integrated with those of other companies.
   But the new system has had costly bugs in it, Turner said.
   ``It's not clear that all of the problems have been completely
worked out in this new system, and this company has had to borrow
money to finance its operations in the last four years,'' Turner
said. ``They could use a little financial backing.''
   Robert Sullivan, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. in New York,
said Foxboro is coming out of a restructuring period.
   ``The company's record in the last few years has been quite
erratic, which has led to some dissatisfaction on the part of some
stockholders,'' Sullivan said.
   ``It's a big and growing market and as (manufacturing) companies
are forced by law to reduce pollution, one of the things they will
be forced to spend money on is equipment to reduce pollution,''
Sullivan said.

   Stock prices were higher at midday Tuesday,
boosted by widespread institutional buying.
   A British newspaper report that the government was considering
joining the pound to Europe's exchange rate mechanism by the fourth
quarter benefited stocks. Government officials described the
Financial Times report as speculative.
   Shortly after midday in London, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 29.2 points, or 1.2 percent, at
2,378.0.

<HEAD>Report: Britain Will Link Pound to System in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government plans to link the pound to Europe's
exchange rate mechanism in the fourth quarter of this year, the
Financial Times reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper said Treasury officials have decided recently that
Britain's underlying annual inflation rate will be low enough
toward year's end to allow the pound to enter the European Monetary
System's exchange rate mechanism.
   The underlying inflation rate is now about 6.25 percent and the
full rate, including mortgage payments, is 9.4 percent.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said
the Financial Times report was ``pure speculation.''
   Mrs. Thatcher said at a European Community summit last June that
Britain would link the pound once British inflation is nearer the
community average, now about 5 percent, and there is free movement
of capital in the community.
   The exchange rate mechanism links nine of the 12 currencies of
the community to prevent wide swings in rates.
   In a statement to Parliament on Thursday, Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major said the government will calculate its
inflation in a way similar to methods used by other community
nations.
   His remarks were taken to mean that the Treasury would strip out
such things as the mortgage interest payments from the British
index.
   Major also said significant progress has been made toward
meeting Mrs. Thatcher's conditions but British inflation was still
too high compared with the EC average.
   The Financial Times said the specific timing of the pound's
entry into the exchange rate mechanism will depend on sterling
staying strong against other European currencies. Putting the pound
into the system at a high level would help control inflation.
   The newspaper said the government considers it wiser to join the
mechanism on condition that the pound be allowed to move within a 6
percent band, rather than the 2.25 percent band to which most of
the system's currencies are limited.

   The managing editor of Entertainment Weekly
magazine has resigned and been replaced by the executive editor of
People magazine, Time Warner Inc. announced.
   Jeff Jarvis cited ``creative differences'' as his reason for
leaving Entertainment Weekly, which Time Inc. Magazine Co. launched
in February. It provides reviews and information on television,
movies, books, music and other forms of entertainment.
   His replacement is James W. Seymore Jr., who joined Time in 1977
as an assistant editor of People. He rose through the ranks at the
weekly celebrity magazine, becoming executive editor in 1988.
   ``We are enormously grateful for all Jeff has done in bringing
Entertainment Weekly to life,'' said Jason McManus, editor-in-chief
of Time Warner Inc., in a statement released Monday. ``We're quite
confident about the magazine's future, due in large part to the
fine staff that Jeff has assembled.''

   Hardee's Food Systems Inc. today
announced the debut of a light hamburger sandwich called THE LEAN 1.
   The hamburger is the lowest-fat quarter-pound burger offered as
a standard-menu item by any national fast-food chain, company
officials said.
   According to Bill Prather, Hardee's president and chief
executive officer, THE LEAN 1 is made from 100 percent American
beef and contains an average of 18 grams of total fat, which is
about 30 percent less than Hardee's other quarter-pound hamburgers.
   Hardee's began testing the new sandwich last month in Peoria,
Ill., Charleston, S.C., Montgomery, Ala., and Harrisburg, Penn.
   Hardee's is the third largest fast-food hamburger restaurant
company in the world, Prather said, with more than 3,300 Hardee's
and 648 Roy Rogers restaurants in 41 states and nine foreign
countries. The company is headquartered in Rocky Mount.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and the French
automaker Renault announced today that they have abandoned their
joint venture in developing and building a new sport-utility
vehicle.
   The ARCAD joint venture, formed in February 1989, ``is no longer
economically attractive,'' the automakers said in a written
statement. Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston declined to elaborate.
   ARCAD was to begin producing a vehicle code-named ``JJ'' in the
second half of 1992 at a Valladolid, Spain, plant leased from
Renault's Spanish subsidiary. The four-wheel-drive vehicles were to
be marketed worldwide except in North America, where ARCAD planned
to build them at an existing Chrysler facility.
   Chrysler intends to develop the JJ project on its own, but a
North American plant still has not been selected, Houston said.
   The decision to terminate ARCAD was not affected by Monday's
vote on a new, seven-year contract by workers at Chrysler's two
Jeep plants in Toledo, Ohio, Houston said. Members of Local 12 of
the United Auto Workers union approved the contract by an
80-percent margin.
   Chrysler has said UAW contract approval was among the steps
needed for it to bring new production to Toledo. The ``JJ'' was
believed to be among the vehicles Chrysler was planning to build
there.
   Local 12 officials did not immediately respond to word that
Chrysler and Renault terminated ARCAD.
   The automakers had budgeted $500 million for ARCAD, but Houston
could not say how much of that was spent. ARCAD production levels
never were established, he said.
   Renault will continue distributing Chrysler's Jeep vehicles in
Europe, the statement said.

   Donald Trump's major bankers are betting the
king of glitzy casinos and real estate can strengthen his
cash-strapped empire under a tentative debt restructuring deal.
   But some analysts say the flamboyant developer, whose marital as
well as financial troubles have been gossip-tabloid fodder, may
have to pay dearly for the breathing room by giving creditors
greater control over his holdings.
   Several major banks agreed over the weekend to extend $60
million in new loans to Trump and suspend interest payments on $2
billion in outstanding debt, banking sources familiar with the
talks said Monday.
   In exchange, Trump promised to pledge as collateral some of his
remaining real estate and casino assets that aren't otherwise
committed to secure loans, said the sources, who spoke on condition
they not be named.
   Those assets include the Trump Plaza Hotel in Atlantic City,
N.J., and the Trump Tower building in Manhattan, they said.
   Trump also may have agreed to forfeit equity in other properties
in return for the suspension of interest payments, and to make
changes in his lavish, high-profile lifestyle, according to a
report in Monday's Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the
tentative bank deal.
   But the Journal article said Trump balked at a bank proposal to
secure the $60 million loan with the apartment portfolio of his
father, Fred Trump, who amassed a fortune in real estate and first
taught the junior Trump the art of the deal.
   The banks hope to give Trump more time to restructure his
operations while he waits out New York City's real estate slump and
the downturn in the Atlantic City gambling market, analysts said.
Without the extra breathing room, Trump could be forced to sell
some of his major assets at bargain prices.
   ``By delaying any sale, they believe this is a way of maximizing
the probability of being paid back,'' said Richard Mueller, an
analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
   Christopher Mahoney of Moody's Investors Service Inc. agreed:
``The banks can't say to him, `If you can't pay, please sell your
buildings today and give us the cash.' The buildings would sell for
a lot less and he could go bankrupt.
   ``The banks would end up owning the buildings. The last thing
they want to do is manage casinos.''
   Jim McDermott, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, said that
while the restructuring keeps Trump out of bankruptcy court, it
places him under tighter control of his creditors.
   ``I'd say he doesn't have as much autonomy as he did
yesterday,'' McDermott said.
   Sources familiar with the negotiations said major banks'
contributions toward the $60 million loan will be proportionate to
the amount they previously lent. Citicorp and Bankers Trust would
provide around two-thirds of the new loan.
   Sources said the next step is to sell the restructuring plan to
smaller creditors, including Japanese banks, which reportedly
purchased part of Trump's loans through syndication.
   Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Chase Manhattan and Manufacturers
Hanover had scheduled a meeting Monday with about 10 additional
banks, sources said.
   ``If any one of the other banks do not go along, then the deal
does not work,'' the Journal quoted one unidentified banker as
saying.
   Spokesmen for the banks and Trump declined to comment officially
on the deal.
   Trump confirmed last week that he was negotiating with the
banks, who reportedly were concerned about his ability to handle
the billions in debt run up in buying big real estate and casino
properties.
   The huge Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City has been a drain on
his cash flow, as have interest payments on roughly $1 billion in
junk bonds he issued to finance the purchase of hotels and the
Trump Shuttle airline.
   The Daily News reported today that the Taj Mahal failed last
week to take in a daily average of $1 million, the amount needed to
earn a profit. It was the first week since the casino's April
opening that the target wasn't hit.
   If the smaller creditors support the proposal, Trump likely
would be able to meet an interest payment due Friday on the bonds
for Trump's Castle casino.
   The Journal said some bankers were concerned that if Trump
missed a payment on the bonds, it would jeopardize the gambling
licenses for all three of his casinos.
   News of the restructuring agreement triggered a rally in the
price of Trump's bonds Monday. The bonds were hammered by word of
the bank talks last week, and some bonds trade for as little as 60
percent of face value.

<TEXT>
   Microsoft Corp. and Everex Corp. say they
have filed lawsuits alleging that 16 individuals and companies have
made or sold a counterfeit version of Microsoft's popular MS-DOS
computer operating system.
   The lawsuits, the first of which was filed under seal April 6,
allege a counterfeiting ring introduced more than 30,000 bogus
copies of MS-DOS into the United States. Microsoft estimated the
counterfeits displaced legitimate sales valued at more than $1.5
million.
   MS-DOS, which stands for Microsoft disk operating system, is the
most widely used operating system for personal computers made by
International Business Machines Corp. and IBM-compatible computers.
The operating system is the basic software that allows the computer
to perform such functions as opening files and responding to the
keyboard.
   The copies were counterfeits of MS-DOS marketed by Everex under
the trade name ParCorp, the companies said Monday. Everex, of
Fremont, Calif., is licensed by Microsoft to produce the operating
system for its private-label computers.
   Seizure orders issued with the lawsuits were executed at six
locations in New Jersey and California between April 10 and May 8,
with U.S. marhsals participating in some of the raids, Microsoft
said. More than 1,000 counterfeit copies were seized, and several
thousand more were subsequently surrendered by four of the
defendants under an order issued by U.S. District Judge Charles A.
Legge, the companies said.
   Named as defendants are J&amp;S International, JIP Design and Joe
Fok, all of San Jose, Calif.; American MultiSource Inc.,
Manufacturing Services Inc., Benny S. Lee, Norman Chan and Susan
Chan, all of Fremont, Calif.; Micro-Generation, a division of
Continental Technology Inc., in Edison, N.J., and its corporate
officers Thomas Wu, Michael Wu and Frank Ho; and Asia Source Inc.
of San Jose, Calif., and its corporate officers Tai Yen Chu, Robert
Young and Christi Liang. Asia Source was a customer of
Micro-Generation.

   Earnings at the nation's 12,588 commercial
banks bounced back in the first three months of 1990 after two soft
quarters, the government said today.
   Despite heavy losses on real estate loans in the Northeast,
banks overall earned $6.2 billion in the January-March period,
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That was a
substantial improvement over profits of $2.1 billion in the fourth
quarter of 1989 and a loss of $700 million in the third quarter.
   However, first-quarter earnings were still down 15 percent from
the record $7.3 billion during the same period a year ago.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, which insures bank
deposits, said the relatively good performance should continue this
year.
   ``We don't see any precipitous change up or down,'' he said.
   While overall results are good, Seidman noted that banks in a
growing number of states are experiencing problems with real estate
loans. The level of sour real estate loans, as a percentage of all
real estate loans, grew in 39 states and the District of Columbia.
   Nationally, banks continue to rely on real estate lending to
support overall growth. Total real estate loans grew by $75
billion, or 11 percent, in the 12 months ending March 31.
   During the same period, delinquent real estate loans grew by $7
billion, or 40 percent.
   On the positive side, the FDIC reported that fewer banks are
failing than last year. Thirty-six failed in the first quarter
compared with 64 during the same period of 1989.
   The number of problem banks _ those in danger of failure _
declined to 1,058 in the first quarter from 1,289 in the same
period a year ago.
   Seidman said the insurance fund backing bank deposits, which
suffered losses in 1988 and 1989, should post a modest profit this
year.
   The FDIC revised its report for 1989 bank profits to $15.7
billion, down $600 million from an earlier report. It attributed
the revision to belated recognition of loan losses.

   The stock market retreated this morning in light
trading after a big runup the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 30.19 points late
Monday, fell 2.47 points to 2,890.10 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 608 up, 585 down and 578 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 45.97 million shares in the
first 90 minutes.
   The market advanced in early trading, but prices fell back
later. Some traders appeared content to wait on the sidelines.
   ``The market is not doing a whole lot today,'' said Dudley
Eppel, senior vice president and managing director of equity
trading at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``I think
it's just a matter now of people watching it for a little while
before buying stocks again.''
   Some analysts expected trading to pick up later in the week when
new government reports on producer and consumer price reports could
give fresh clues on the state of the economy.
   ``If there's something dramatic in the figures, it will pick up
the volume,'' Eppel said.
   Among active stocks, Boeing fell back \ to 58\ after gaining 3
Monday when the Seattle-based company said it had received an order

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by
the corn market amid fresh indications that rain had delayed
planting.
   The Agriculture Department said Monday that 94 percent of the
U.S. corn crop was planted as of Sunday compared with 88 percent a
week ago, 96 percent a year ago and the five-year average of 99
percent.
   Soybean planting was 66 percent complete Sunday compared with 48
percent a week ago, 74 percent a year ago and an 82 percent
average, the USDA said.
   Another USDA report issued late Monday indicated exports of U.S.
soybeans are running above trade expections while corn exports are
about as expected.
   A USDA report due out this afternoon was expected to confirm
perceptions of dwindling corn stocks and reflect some deterioration
of the winter wheat crop due to extremely heavy rain last month in
the Central and Southern Plains, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to 2\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.35 a bushel;
corn futures were 2 cents to 2} cents higher with July at $2.92 a
bushel; oats were 1 cent higher across the board with July at
$1.48\ a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3 cents higher with July
at $6.10 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange; pork futures were mostly higher, extending
Monday's gains.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .33 cent lower with June at 76.07
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .32 cent to .43 cent lower with
August at 85.02 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .15
cent higher with June at 64.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .32 cent lower to 1.45 cents higher with July at 71.20 cents a
pound.
   The July and August belly contracts posted limit gains of 2
cents a pound Monday, contributing to gains in the hog and cattle
markets.

   ``Credit records are more than just account numbers. They are a
consumer's reputation,'' Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., told the
House Banking subcommittee on consumer affairs.
   The panel is considering ways to update the 20-year-old Fair
Credit Reporting Act to keep up with major advances in computer
technology that have made credit reporting a booming business.
   Rinaldo, sponsor of one of three proposed bills, said credit
reports should be provided only for transactions initiated by
consumers, not for such things as direct-mail marketing, mailing
lists or pre-approved lines of credit.
   However, Jean Noonan, associate director of the Federal Trade
Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said that although
there is a danger that use of credit reports can be an invasion of
privacy, her office would rather regulate it than ban it.
   Subcommittee Chairman Richard Lehman, D-Calif., has proposed
allowing credit reports to be used for solicitation if consumers
are allowed to bar their own files from such use.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is sponsoring a proposal similar
to Rinaldo's to ban such use of consumer credit files.
   Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., ranking minority member of the
subcommittee, said the proposals went too far.
   ``We also have to be concerned that we do not shut off the flow
of credit to all but the most gold-plated credit risks,'' Hiler
said.
   Bonnie Guiton, director of the U.S. Office of Consumer Affairs,
opposed proposals to require credit reporting companies to provide
customers a free annual copy of their credit record. The consumers
will end up paying the cost, she said, adding that credit companies
instead should have to conduct random checks on their own work and
publish the results.
   The various proposals also include language to give consumers
new power to correct errors in their credit reports, and require
that they be notified when their credit report is used to deny them
a transaction.
   On Monday, a Louis Harris &amp; Associates poll reported that 71
percent of those Americans surveyed believe consumers have lost
control over how businesses handle personal information about their
customers.
   Consumers want the Fair Credit Reporting Act updated to guard
against misuse of personal information, said Alan F. Westin, the
Columbia University professor who conducted the survey.
   But Westin said consumers were willing to make a ``fair
information bargain'' with the government and industry so they can
still have access to conveniences such as direct-mail and credit
cards.
   ``Consumers want it all,'' he said. ``They want both privacy and
they want the benefits of a consumer society.''
   The survey was commissioned by Equifax, an Atlanta-based company
that provides information and technology to businesses including
employers, insurers and credit companies.
   It found that 79 percent of those questioned were either very
concerned or somewhat concerned about threats to their personal
privacy, compared with 77 percent in a 1983 Harris survey and 64
percent in a 1978 poll.
   In 1970, only 34 percent said they were concerned about privacy
issues.
   A large majority said privacy should be considered a fundamental
right, and 30 percent said they had decided against applying for a
job, credit or insurance because they didn't want to provide
certain kinds of information about themselves, the survey found.
   But 78 percent said they would be upset if they couldn't get
credit based on their record of paying bills.
   The random telephone poll included 2,254 interviews in January
and February, and 2,253 interviews in April, with about half of the
first group of people being re-interviewed. The margin of error was
plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEAD>EC Submits Proposal to Liberalize Trade in Textiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community on Tuesday submitted a
proposal to liberalize trade in textiles and clothing by phasing
out an existing agreement that regulates commerce in the
politically sensitive sector.
   The EC plan presented to members of the 96-nation General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aims at bringing trade in textiles
into conformity with GATT's free trade principles.
   The sector has for the past 30 years been governed by the
Multi-Fiber Arrangement which provides for quotas, negotiated on a
bilateral basis. The current MFA is due to expire in July 1991.
   World trade in textiles totalled $89 billion in 1988 while the
clothing sector was worth some $88 billion, according to figures
from the Geneva-based GATT secretariat.
   The EC plan proposes that most existing MFA quotas should be
gradually enlarged by a given percentage before they are finally
abolished, according to trade officials.
   However, the EC also said it was prepared to negotiate a list of
some products that could be brought into the GATT before the
transition period begins.
   The 12-nation trading bloc did not set a timetable for
liberalizing trade or specify the pace at which quotas should be
increased during the transition period, trade officials said.
   One source, who declined to be identified, said some negotiators
at the meeting criticized the proposals for being too imprecise.
   The EC plan to start from the basis of the existing MFA
contrasts with the U.S. approach. The United States wants to
abandon the MFA when it expires next year and introduce a new
10-year global quota system. Critics of the American plan argue
that Washington is seeking to introduce new restrictions through
this scheme in order to placate its powerful textile lobby which
fears competition from Third World exporters.
   The 22-nation International Textiles and Clothing Bureau, which
represents major Third World producers, is due to present a
proposal on Wednesday to phase out restrictions on their exports
within six years.
   New rules on textiles are due to be resolved in December, when
the four-year Uruguay Round of negotiations is scheduled to end.

   In a survey of American perceptions of
marketplace values, which came first, the chicken or the lawyer?
   The chicken not only won by a large margin, it placed first in
the study while lawyers' fees came in next to the bottom, edged out
for the very worst rating by hospital charges.
   The health-care area in general received low consumer acceptance
marks, but the legal profession's activities might have something
to do with that too.
   High health-care costs, explained Fabian Linden, head of the
Conference Board's consumer research center, have an important
legal component, primarily in the form of high malpractice
insurance costs.
   The survey was conducted for the board by National Family
Opinion Inc. of Toledo, Ohio, as part of an ongoing study of
consumer confidence. Every second month, said Linden, there is room
for special studies, such as this one.
   Generally speaking, the consumer acceptance ratings for late in
1989 showed little change from those of other years, except perhaps
to show some slippage when compared to two or three years earlier.
   There were few surprises. As before, consumers expressed a
relatively high level of satisfaction with foods purchased for home
consumption, including poultry, meat, fish, fruits and vegetables.
   They thought rather highly of the values in video rentals,
television sets, appliances, haircuts, electricity, telephone
service, restaurant meals and, although the ultimate consumer was
not questioned, pet food.
   Accompanying hospital charges and lawyers' fees at the lower end
of the chart were credit card charges, premium pay television,
health insurance, movies at theaters, admission to sports events,
and automobile insurance.
   Contrary to some popular opinions that older people are more
difficult to satisfy, the survey showed little difference in the
attitudes of young and old. And, says Linden, surprising
similarities were found through all income levels.
   The survey did reveal significant attitudinal differences in
regard to foreign versus domestic cars.
   Despite impressions that consumers prefer foreign makes, they
rated them only a bit higher than domestic cars, but differences
became sharper with age. Foreign cars scored better with the young,
domestic models with older people.
   Foreign cars also scored better on the East and West coasts,
which Linden attributes to concentrations of younger people, while
domestic models rated higher in much of the remainder of the nation.
   One of the best foreign-car ratings was in the Northeast where,
said Linden, young workers in the financial industries often earned
``embarassingly large sums of money'' and sought to use those sums
conspicuously.
   In all, the levels of consumer acceptance are perhaps close to
what most people think they are.
   In the middle range of relative acceptance, for example, are
such items as U.S. postage, furniture, prescription drugs, dry
cleaning. Lower-middle includes mass transit, hotel stays, air
fares, toys. Higher-middle includes men's shoes, men and women's
apparel, personal care and eyeglasses.
   And what level is occupied by used cars, so often considered one
of the more questionable values in the American markeplace?
   True, they were low in the consumer acceptance ratings, below
home repairs and appliance repairs, but higher in acceptability
than bank service charges.
   And considerably higher than those lawyers' fees and hospital
charges.

   Share prices closed higher Tuesday on London's
Stock Exchange, but were knocked off their peaks for the day by
modest losses on Wall Street.
   The market opened strongly, tracking Wall ctReet's Monday Gains
and boosted by a strengthening pound, dealers said.
   Sterling rose on a Financial Times report that the pound would
be linked to Europe's exchange rate mechanism by the fourth
quarter. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's press office called the
report speculation.
   Stock prices consolidated their gains during the afternoon, but
then retreated in line with a weaker Dow Jones industrial average
in New York.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Continues Shrinking</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Trade, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus declined slightly in May, the
12th month in the last 13 during which the surplus narrowed from a
year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported Tuesday.
   The May surplus of $3.13 billion compared with $3.76 billion in
May 1989. Exports fell 0.9 percent from a year earlier to $21.52
billion, while imports grew by 2.4 percent to $18.38 billion.
   Economists said a slowing in the rate of export declines
indicated the yen's recent weakness may cause a renewed buildup in
the surplus. They added that slower growth in the domestic economy
may be depressing imports.
   A cheaper yen makes Japanese goods more competitive in price
overseas.
   ``After seeing these figures, I'm confident that possibly as
early as July we could see a widening in Japan's trade surplus,''
said Jesper Koll, an economist at S.G. Warburg Securities.
   Bank of Tokyo economist Toshio Yamasaki said a weaker domestic
economy will encourage companies to ship their products abroad.
   Lower oil prices also reduced the value of Japan's imports in
May. Its crude oil imports increased 3.1 percent in volume, but
dropped 4 percent in value terms, to $1.71 billion. Japanese
importers paid an average of $16.79 a barrel for crude oil in May,
down from $18.02 a year earlier.
   In trade with the United States, Japan's surplus shrank to $2.44
billion in May from $2.76 billion a year earlier.
   Japanese companies exported $6.82 billion worth of goods to the
United States in May, down 4.5 percent from a year earlier. Imports
from the United States fell 0.2 percent to $4.38 billion.
   Japan's surplus with the European Community shrank to $1.2
billion from $1.63 billion in May 1989. Exports totaled $4.07
billion, up 7.1 percent, against imports of $2.87 billion, up 32.3
percent.

<TEXT>
   United Arab Emirates Oil Minister Mana Saeed
Otaiba on Tuesday urged oil-producing countries within OPEC and out
of it to cooperate in an effort to stabilize the world petroleum
market.
   At a news conference held with Egypt's Oil Minister Abdel-Hadi
Kandeel, Otaiba said an emergecy OPEC conference would be held as
soon as needed.
   He stressed the importance for all OPEC countries to abide by
the cartel's decisions and cited as an example the UAE which he
said reduced its daily petroleum production quota to 1.9 million
barrels from 2.1 million barrels.
   The UAE's 1.9 million quota is still far above its OPEC-decreed
ceiling of 1.095. In May however, the UAE was reportedly producing
2.05 million barrels a day.
   Despite an OPEC agreement in Geneva on May 2 to limit overall
production to 22.1-22.6 million barrels a day, production last
month remained high at an estimated 23.68 million barrels a day,
the Middle East Economic Survey reported Monday. The newsletter
singled out Kuwait and the UAE as producing well above their quotas
set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   MEES said the average spot price for seven OPEC crudes dropped
to $15.45 a barrel in May from $15.63 a barrel in April,
significantly lower than the cartel's benchmark price of $18 per
barrel.
   Otaiba said preparation for a new OPEC ministerial conference
has begun, and ``if neccessity calls for such an emergency
conference, it will be held.''
   Otaiba said he expects the current oil market crisis to end in
two months following efforts and contacts among OPEC and non-OPEC
oil producing countries.
   ``I have great hope that we can control the temporary crisis and
overcome the terror gripping the market,'' he said.

   The U.S. dollar ended narrowly mixed in Europe on
Tuesday, while the pound soared. Gold prices rose.
   The dollar continued to trade in well-established ranges,
dealers said.
   Andrew Ellott, international foreign exchange salesman for Chase
Manhattan Bank in London, said he doesn't expect the dollar to
break out of its current trading ranges until Friday's release of
U.S. trade figures.
   Most of the market's interest was focused on a rush to buy
sterling against most other currencies, which pushed the pound to
its highest level on a trade-weighted basis since late September,
although it reached only a four-month peak against the dollar.
   The buying was prompted by a Financial Times reported Tuesday
that Treasury officials have decided recently that Britain's
underlying annual inflation rate will be low enough toward the end
of the year to allow the pound to enter Europe's exchange rate
mechanism in the fourth quarter.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's office said
the report was ``pure speculation.''
   The British pound soared to $1.7020 in London from $1.6858 late
Monday. By midday in New York it traded at $1.70245.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.6920 West German marks, up from 1.6910; 1.4367 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4400; 5.6950 French francs, up from 5.6900; 1.9045 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.9040; 1,242.35 Italian lire, down from
1,242.75; and 1.1713 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1705.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 154.625
Japanese yen, 1.6965 West German marks, 1.44025 Swiss francs,
1,245.45 Italian lire, and 1.17095 Canadian dollars.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.30 yen to a closing 154.40 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 154.44 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $356.25 a troy ounce,
up from $354.45 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid
of $355.65 an ounce, up from $355 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.07 to close at a bid $357.82
an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.06 a
troy ounce from Monday's $5.01.

   Corn futures prices rose strongly Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade while other grain and soybean futures closed
mixed ahead of a government report on agricultural supply and
demand.
   ``It was an evening-up day,'' typical of trading before a major
Agriculture Department crop report, said John Frazier, director of
agricultural commodities trading for Gerald Inc.
   The monthly report scheduled for release after the close of
trading was expected to indicate shrinking U.S. stockpiles of corn
and soybeans, and some deterioration of the winter wheat crop, as a
result of last month's excessive rain in the Central and Southern
Plains.
   The USDA said Monday that 94 percent of the U.S. corn crop was
planted as of Sunday compared with 88 percent a week ago, 96
percent a year ago and the five-year average of 99 percent.
   Soybean planting was 66 percent complete Sunday compared with 48
percent a week ago, 74 percent a year ago and an 82 percent average
over the last five years, the USDA said.
   At the close, wheat futures prices were 1 cent lower to 2\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.35 a bushel;
corn futures were 2{ cents to 4 cents higher with July at $2.92\ a

   Even with the quarter's improvement, the United States is
beginning the 1990s in a far different position from the beginning
of the 1980s. A decade ago, America was the largest creditor
nation. It ran surpluses in its current account as the earnings on
overseas investments were enough to offset perennial deficits in
merchandise trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
in payments for imported cars and televisions, the investment
cushion eroded. It disappeared altogether in 1985, when the United
States became a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   That means foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than Americans
own overseas, a development that has led some to say the United
States is losing control over its economic destiny.
   Tuesday's report indicates America's debtor position has now
risen to around $670 billion, although the government's official
accounting of the gap between U.S. holdings and foreign investments
will not be released for several more weeks.
   Brad Larschan, an attorney with the Association for
International Investment, a lobbying group for foreign companies
doing business in the United States, said there was a growing push
in Congress to restrict foreign investment, which he termed an
``unfortunate development'' given America's continued need to
finance the shortfall in its current account position with foreign
borrowing.
   ``We are concerned about the rising protectionism in Congress
and throughout the country,'' Larschan said. ``In a political
sense, this is open season on foreign investors. This is coming at
a time when the United States is scrambling to compete with other
countries for investment capital.''
   For the first three months of the year, the merchandise trade
deficit narrowed by 8.2 percent to $26.37 billion as an all-time
high in U.S. export sales offset the highest volume of oil imports
in more than 12 years.
   The surplus in the investment category rose by 8.3 percent to
$608 million while the surplus in the services category, which
covers such things as foreign tourist spending in the United States
and banking and insurance earnings by U.S. companies operating
overseas, rose 3.1 percent to $6.31 billion.
   The fourth category in the current account, unilateral
transfers, covers U.S. foreign aid payments and pension benefits
paid to Americans living overseas. It shrank by 25 percent to $3.49
billion in the first quarter.
   The sum of the various categories equals the current account
figure of $22.94 billion for the first quarter.

<HEAD>NYSE Study Proposes Wider Trading Halts</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds details and quotes throughout, no pickup.</NOTE>

   A New York Stock Exchange report released today
proposed more widespread use of trading halts to curb stock-price
volatility and recommended tighter regulatory control over
financial markets to raise investor confidence.
   The report capped a six-month study into the reasons for
unwieldy markets, which have dogged the securities industry since
the market collapse of October 1987 and have been partly blamed for
a declining interest in stock ownership by individual investors.
   But the NYSE's conclusions didn't significantly differ than
other studies into the causes of wild price swings. They also found
nothing inherently wrong with ``program trading,'' the computerized
strategy of instantly buying or selling large quantities of stocks,
which some critics have blamed for exaggerating movements in prices
and frightening investors off.
   ``We found that the markets are essentially stable and sound,
and that they are not `tilted' against the individual investor,''
said General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger B. Smith, who headed the
18-member blue-ribbon panel on market volatility and investor
confidence.
   ``There is, however, ample room for improvement, particularly in
increasing public understanding of markets and how they have
changed in recent years,'' he said.
   Smith and fellow panelists spoke at a news conference at NYSE
headquarters, where the long-awaited study was released. The
market's failure to react to its conclusions suggested that people
in the securities industry found nothing threatening about them.
   ``I don't think that's a primary concern right now,'' said
Philip Rettew, a senior market analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the
nation's biggest securities company. ``The market cares more about
the economic numbers.''
   Among the NYSE proposals was a ``four-tier circuit breaker''
that would halt trading for an hour when the Dow Jones industrial
average moves up or down 100 points from the previous day's close;
90 minutes when it moves 200 points; and two hours when it moves at
least 300 points.
   The proposed halts are for longer periods than previous,
temporary circuit breakers enacted by the NYSE to control potential
panic in the market.
   The panel was formed after the 190-point plunge by the Dow
industrials last Oct. 13, which began with word that a takeover
offer for the parent of United Airlines had collapsed. Some experts
have said that single event, combined with speculative selling and
program trading, destabilized the market.
   The NYSE study concluded that ``market volatility and program
trading are not the primary concern of individual investors, who
are more concerned about whether today's markets are operated
fairly and honestly.''
   Nonetheless, it said, ``the belief that program trading has
diminished the fairness of markets reduces investor confidence.''
   Other recommendations in the NYSE report include better systems
to detect intermarket trading abuses; a loosening of constraints on
corporations' ability to buy their own stock during volatile
markets;s, played on
the par-73, 5,967-yard Dunbar Golf Club course:
   Lisa Hackney, Britain, 71.
   Alison Rose, Scotland, 71.
   Matte Hageman, Netherlands, 71.
   Martina Koch, West Germany, 71.
   Daphne Pourhappen is have a group of 60- to 90-year-old people
going out and weight-lifting'' because of the risk of injury,
Herling said by telephone. She said elderly people who want to lift
weights should consult a physician.
   During the study, conducted in the summer of 1988, six women and
four men participated in an eight-week weight-training program that
focused on the quadriceps muscle at the front of the thigh.
   Three times a week, for eight weeks, the subjects performed leg
lifts with weights for about 45 minutes a session.
   By the end of the eight-week training period, all nine subjects
who completed the study had at least doubled the amount of weight
they could lift, and some had tripled and quadrupled that amount,
Fiatarone said.
   The average increase in single-leg exercises went from 16 pounds
at the beginning to about 42 pounds by the end of the training, she
said in a telephone interview.
   One 86-year-old man stopped after four weeks because of pain at
the site of a previous hernia. The rest completed the training with
little pain and no injuries, the researchers said.
   They called the results ``remarkable'' considering the subjects'
age and poor health condition at the start of the study. Seven had
arthritis, six had heart disease, and four had hypertension.
   The subjects stopped weight-lifting at the end of the eight-week
period, and four weeks later, they had lost about one-third of the
strength they had gained, Fiatarone said.
   A similar loss would be expected in a younger person, she said,
noting that for the results to be lasting, weight-training must be
done on a long-term basis.
   Although the study focused only on leg muscles, Fiatarone said
it can be assumed weight-training also would strengthen upper-body
muscles in the elderly.
   The researcher said the results indicate that weight-training
can be used in the elderly to help them gain strength and possibly
avoid the falls and other accidents associated with weakness.
   But Herling said more research is needed to determine if
weight-training strengthens upper-body muscles in the very old,
adding that those muscles tend to be the weakest in the elderly.
   But she also said that the study ``certainly sheds new light on
the capabilities that these elderly patients ... can achieve, and
that's promising.''

   A late wave of buying caused stocks to surge
today, adding to gains in the previous session.
   The market had fluctuated in a narrow range until the last hour
of trading, when stocks began to gain in a rally that brokers
attributed to computerized stock-buying strategies.
   Trading volume remained light throughout the day, as traders
awaited new government reports on producer and consumer price
reports that will provide fresh information on the direction of the
economy.
   ``If there's something dramatic in the figures, it will pick up
the volume,'' said Dudley Eppel, senior vice president and managing

   Hardee's announced a new, leaner
quarter-pound hamburger Tuesday, but competitors said the fast-food
company is playing catch up.
   The Rocky Mount-based company announced ``THE LEAN 1,'' a
quarter-pound burger with an average of 18 grams of total fat that
it described as the lowest-fat burger in the business.
   The response from competitor Wendy's was a little frosty.
   ``This really isn't news as far as we're concerned although we
applaud the efforts of people trying to bring more nutritious food
to the public,'' said Charlie Rath, vice president for marketing at
the Dublin, Ohio-based company.
   Rath said Wendy's quarter-pound single hamburger has 15 grams of
fat, lower than any of the competitors.
   Not so, said Cori Zywotow, a spokeswoman for Burger King in
Miami. Her company's comparable hamburger had 11 grams of fat, she
said.
   ``You really need to listen to consumers and have a variety. We
certainly work to please our customers,'' Ms. Zywotow said in a
telephone interview.
   Fat content and other health-related issues have received more
attention from fast-food companies in recent years due to
heightened consumer awareness and activism.
   Officials at McDonald's Corp., the nation's biggest fast-food
restaurant chain, had no comment Tuesday afternoon on the Hardee's
announcement. But Hardee's spokesman John Merritt threw down the
kitchen glove to any and all challengers.
   ``If anybody wants to do a comparison ... I'll pay any
independent laboratory for the testing and bet $1,000 to any one of
those groups that our LEAN burger is the lowest fat product on the
market,'' Merritt said.
   He said that by percentage, Hardee's quarter-pound hamburger
boasted a 17.9 percent fat ratio. That compared with 22.8 percent
for Wendy's and 22.5 percent for Burger King, according to figures
from testing by Hardee's, he said.
   The major chains already have taken other moves to educate
customers or offer foods with less saturated fat, which has been
found to raise the risk of heart disease.
   McDonald's said last Friday it would post complete nutritional
information _ including fat and sodium levels _ on all of its
products at its restaurants this summer.
   McDonald's also has said it is experimenting with using pure
vegetable oil _ rather than the current beef shortening-vegetable
oil mixture _ for frying its french fries and hash browns.
   Hardee's prepared statement released Tuesday said it was the
first chain to introduce a non-breaded, non-fried chicken sandwich
on its menu. More than two years ago, Hardee's switched to
all-vegetable oil to cook its french fries.
   Burger King is testing the use of vegetable oil and has a
grilled chicken sandwich.
   All of the four big chains offer salads.

<HEAD>ITT Selling Alcatel Stake for $640 Million, Reducing Interest to
30 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Corp. said Tuesday it will sell 7 percent of
Alcatel NV to its partner in the French telecommunications
equipment manufacturing joint venture for $640 million.
   The sale of the stake to France's Compagnie Generale
d'Electricite will reduce ITT's ownership in Alcatel to 30 percent,
which was the level ITT sought to own in the 1986 negotiations on
forming the joint venture.
   But in order to assure completion of the deal, which created the
world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, ITT in 1986
agreed to take a 37 percent interest in Alcatel.
   ITT will report an after-tax gain of about $139 million from the
transaction, which is expected to close on June 14. The gain will
be included in ITT's second-quarter earnings, the company said in a
news release.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to buy back additional
shares of ITT common stock under the company's stock repurchase
program. Since the program started in 1987, ITT has bought back 25
million shares.
   Rand V. Araskog, ITT's chairman and chief executive and also
chairman of Alcatel's supervisory board, said ITT's investment in
Alcatel has grown handsomely since the Paris-based venture began.
   ``Our Alcatel shares have more than doubled in value in three
years and our board of directors is pleased not only with this
outstanding appreciation of our investment, but also with the
positive working relationship developed between ITT and CGE,'' he
said.
   The sale of 7 percent of Alcatel will allow ITT to realize a
return from this increased value while retaining a substantial
ownership position to take advantage of growth projected for
Alcatel in the future, he said.
   Alcatel's growth has been spurred by economic development within
European Community and Eastern Europe. The creation of a single
European marketplace is expected to enhance demand for equipment
Alcatel supplies.
   ITT said its assets in Europe total $5 billion, or 11 percent of
its total assets.
   The New York-based company is primarily involved in the
telecommunications field. It also has interests in the automotive,
defense technology, electronics, pulp and timber, insurance, hotels
and finance areas.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. and French automaker Renault on
Tuesday terminated a joint venture to build a small sport-utility
vehicle, but Chrysler said it planned to continue developing the
project.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said the company, which saw its
first quarter profit drop by 80 percent, decided the ARCAD project
is no longer economically attractive.
   ``Chrysler intends to continue with the `JJ' project and is
reviewing various implementation alternatives,'' Houston said,
declining to disclose details. His statement indicated the company
may be considering developing the vehicle by itself or with another
partner.
   The collapse of the $500 million ARCAD joint venture could delay
Chrysler's plans to expand in Europe, which is seen as a
potentially huge market once internal trade barriers are lifted in
1992 and former East Bloc nations continue liberalizing their
economies.
   ARCAD was to begin producing the vehicle, code-named ``JJ,'' in
the second half of 1992 at a Valladolid, Spain, plant leased from
Renault's Spanish subsidiary.
   The four-wheel-drive vehicles were to be marketed worldwide
except in North America, where ARCAD planned to build them at an
existing Chrysler facility.
   During the past year, Chrysler has shown signs of growing in
Europe, where it has had little presence in the past. The company
recently signed a deal to build minivans in Austria.
   Last week, General Motors Corp. announced a joint venture with
Volga Auto Works of the Soviet Union. GM executives said the
project to provide fuel system components represented their
entrance to a potentially huge marketplace.
   It appears unlikely that production of the ``JJ'' could begin in
North America before late 1992, the original target date of the
ARCAD agreement.
   ARCAD had not said where North American production would be
located, but speculation surrounded Chrysler's Jeep plant in
Toledo, Ohio.
   On Monday, members of United Auto Workers union Local 12 in
Toledo approved a new local labor agreement seen as key to bringing
production of the ``JJ'' and the Jeep Wrangler, now made in Canada,
to the aging factory.
   The ``JJ'' would be built in pieces by suppliers and shipped to
an assembly plant, said Joseph Phillippi, an auto industry analyst
for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York.
   ``There is no stamping, no machining, no painting,'' he said.
Because of potential that the JJ would have to be priced low to
fight competition from the Geo Tracker, Suzuki Sidekick and
Daihatsu Rocky, per-vehicle profit would be relatively low,
Phillippi said.
   Chrysler has been getting most of its profits from sales of its
minivans and its Jeep line, which it acquired with the purchase of
American Motors Corp. in August 1987.
   But recently, Chrysler's profits have been falling, its sales
have been slipping and top-level executives have been leaving.
   The company earned $359 million last year, down 65.8 percent
from 1988 profits. Through the first five months of this year
Chrysler had sold 713,883 cars and trucks, down 12.8 percent from
last year.
   Four top level executives, including former Vice Chairman Gerald
Greenwald, recently have announced they were leaving Chrysler or
would do so by year'd end.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Transport said Tuesday that
talks continued between the United States and Britain on allowing
each other's airlines to fly to more cities, and the Times of
London said an agreement was near.
   Although a department spokesman said there was no indication of
a resolution soon, the Times reported that the countries have
nearly completed a deal under which American Airlines, Northwest
Airlines and Delta Air Lines would obtain rights to fly to
Manchester, England, from Chicago, Boston and Atlanta,
respectively. All three already fly to Manchester from other cities.
   The airlines would be given the opportunity to vary those
routes, and they also would be allowed to fly on to Paris and
Frankfurt if France and West Germany agree, the newspaper said,
without identifying its source.
   In return, Virgin Atlantic Airways of Great Britain would be
allowed to fly from London's Gatwick airport to Boston, the
newspaper said, and British Airways and other British airlines
would be allowed to fly to major American cities from any regional
airport in Britain.
   Talks began more than a year ago on a new bilateral air services
agreement to replace the Bermuda II deal, which was reached in the
mid-1970s.
   The Times said British Airways, Britain's largest airline, is
strongly opposed to the agreement, calling it a ``sellout'' of
British aviation to the Americans.
   British Airways says the right to fly from British regional
airports to the United States was useless because there was little
demand for such service, the Times said.
   British Airways flies to New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Houston,
Dallas, San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Anchorage,
Miami, Tampa and Orlando, Fla.
   Virgin Atlantic flies to New York, Miami and Los Angeles.
   Trans World Airlines, Pan Am, American, Delta, Continental
Airlines, U.S. Air and Northwest fly to Heathrow and Gatwick
airports in London, to Manchester and to Glasgow, Scotland.

<HEAD>Gasoline Leads Oil Futures Rise Amid Mega Borg Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline for July delivery soared more than 2.6 cents a gallon
Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, erasing steep losses
registered during the three previous trading sessions.
   Market analysts said the rally reflected a bevy of minor
influences, including jitters about the crippled oil supertanker
Mega Borg off the Texas coast.
   On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures were
mixed; livestock futures fell while pork bellies advanced; and
precious metals were mixed.
   Wholesale gasoline futures settled 1.3 cents to 2.62 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July up 2.62 cents at 58.5
cents a gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures finished 3 cents to 69
cents higher with July at $17.51 a barrel; wholesale heating oil
ended .60 cent to 1.66 cents higher with July at 48.29 cents a
gallon.
   Analysts viewed the rally partly as a technical correction after
a three-day decline in which the July gasoline contract fell a
total of 2.48 cents.
   Buying by wholesalers and distributors in the cash gasoline
market also contributed to the runup, as did concerns about the
burning supertanker in the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``It tends to conjure up images of last year's Exxon Valdez
incident, which sparked a huge rally in the gasoline market,'' said
James Ritterbusch, an energy analyst for PaineWebber Inc.
   An announcement from Royal Dutch-Shell Group that it no longer
would use its own ships to send most petroleum products to the
United States supported prices. The British-Dutch oil giant has
been concerned about liability costs associated with environmental
damage from recent tanker spills.
   The rally also reflected speculation that Tuesday's weekly
American Petroleum Institute stocks report would show a drawdown in
U.S. supplies of gasoline, Ritterbusch said.
   But the report, which was released after the close of trading,
instead showed a 511,000-barrel increase in gasoline supplies along
with a 1.26-million-barrel rise in crude oil stocks and a
479,000-barrel increase in distillate stocks.
   The crude oil number also ran counter to market expectations
while the rise in distillate stocks was smaller than most traders
had anticipated.
   Corn futures rose strongly on the Chicago Board of Trade while
other grain and soybean futures finished mixed ahead of a
government report on agricultural supply and demand.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the USDA
lowered its 1990 winter wheat producton forecast to 2.089 billion
bushels from last month's projection of 2.092 billion. The number
was slightly above market expections and still well above last
year's harvest of 1.454 billion bushels.
   The USDA also projected further shrinkage of U.S. soybean and
corn stockpiles but said wheat stocks will rise.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 2{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.35\ a bushel; corn futures were 2{ cents
to 4 cents higher with July at $2.92\ a bushel; oats were { cent to
1\ cents lower with July at $1.46 a bushel; soybeans were unchanged
to 1 cent lower with July at $6.07{ a bushel.
   Most livestock futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, erasing some of Monday's gains.
   But pork belly futures advanced for the fourth straight day
ahead of a report that showed a 3.04-million-pound drawdown last
week in supplies of frozen bellies in warehouses outside of
Chicago. The reduction was larger than expected.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent lower to .08 cent higher

   Stocks advanced to near-record levels Tuesday,
strengthened by a late-afternoon rally that extended Monday's gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 30.19 points
on Monday, gained another 40.85 points to 2,933.42, much of that in
the final hour of trading. It was the second highest closing level
in history, eclipsed only by the record 2,935.19 reached June 4.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1003 up, 545 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 157.10 million
shares, up from a two-month low of 119.55 million shares in the
previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 187.36 million shares.
   Analysts attributed the rally to a bout of program trading, the
computerized strategy of buying and selling large quantities of
stocks and stock-index futures to exploit price disparities in the
two markets. They said buying programs kicked in automatically late
in the day when futures prices substantially exceeded stock prices,
making stocks an attractive buy.
   Some analysts said the two-day surge provided evidence that last
week's drop in prices was just a temporary setback.
   ``We know there's a lot of skeptics still on the fence, and the
performance of the market has been dragging more of the skeptics
into the market,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer for
First Albany Corp.
   Volume again was light, although analysts expected trading to
pick up later in the week when the government releases reports on
producer and consumer prices. The reports should provide fresh
information on the direction of the economy.
   ``It looks like a market waiting for news, or waiting for
something to happen,'' said Robert Farrell, chief market analyst at
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Among active stocks, Boeing gained &rsqb; to 58~ on top of Monday's
3-point gain, which followed another announcement of a large order
for jumbo jets.
   Other active stocks posting gains included General Electric, up
1&rsqb; to 70\; Exxon, up 1 to 48~; Coca Cola, up ~ to 45&rsqb;; IBM, up &rsqb; to
120\; Westinghouse, up &rsqb; to 37~; and Philip Morris, up ~ to 45.
   Procter &amp; Gamble jumped 3{ to 84\, while ITT rose 3\ to 60|. ITT
on Tuesday reported plans to sell a 7 percent stake in a joint
venture and use the proceeds to buy back shares.
   American Express was down \ to 30&rsqb;, while Eastman Kodak was down
\ to 41&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $37.07 billion, or
1.07 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.24 to 199.66.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.10 to 427.32, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index increased 4.62 at 366.25.
   The NASDAQ composite index for l competence'' of the individual.
   The Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., who is completing
his term as president, told the convention that some want to leave
``room for all'' in the denomination, but ``that's too much room.''
   He said denominations that haven't insisted on an ``infallible
inerrant'' Bible were bound for ``the garbage dump.''
   The campaigns for the presidency were intensified this time by
added fundamentalist attacks on seminaries, including the
administration and some professors at the 131-year-old flagship
Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville, Ky.
   Its president, the Rev. Roy Honeycutt, and the faculty have
struck back, calling accusations of ``doctrinal infidelity'' false
distortions that ``sow seeds of hate.''
   Chapman, 49, a Mississippi native, got his theological education
at Southwester Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.
He was pastor of churches in Albuquerque, N.M., and in Waco and
Rogers, Texas, before assuming his present pastorate at First
Baptist Church in Wichita Falls, Texas.
   Vestal, 46, the son of an evangelist, also got his ministerial
education at the Fort Worth seminary. He previously led churches in
Arlington, Fort Worth and Midland, Texas, before becoming pastor of
Dunwoody Baptist Church in suburban Atlanta.

   A New York Stock Exchange panel Tuesday proposed
new severe trading halts to curb wild price swings but said widely
criticized program trading strategies didn't cause market
volatility.
   The report capped a six-month study commissioned after the stock
market plunged last October, driving away many individual investors
already shaken by the 1987 crash and provoking an outcry against
program trading.
   ``We need the small investor to feel he can go in and invest
with confidence,'' said General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith,
chairman of the 19-member Market Volatility and Investor Confidence
Panel.
   The group proposed that the NYSE install ``circuit-breakers'' to
slow trading during wide market fluctuations. The system would put
a 400-point cap on the possible daily rise or fall in the Dow Jones
industrial average and the nation's futures and options markets
would coordinate trading halts.
   But the panel found nothing inherently wrong with program
trading. The computer-driven strategy typically links the buying
and selling of stock and stock-index futures and has been blamed
for scaring away individual investors by feeding market plunges.
   It suggested that program trading was a public relations problem
for Wall Street and the perception that such strategies were unfair
to individual investors or an abuse of the markets ``is largely
unwarranted.''
   The panel was formed after the 190-point plunge by the Dow
industrials last Oct. 13, which began with word that a takeover
offer for the parent of United Airlines had collapsed. Some experts
have said that single event, combined with speculative selling and
program trading, destabilized the market.
   A type of program trading also has been blamed for worsening the
Black Monday stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow
industrials fell 508 points. Since the crash, the securities
industry has been attempting to address questions about program
trading in order to head off possibly restrictive moves by federal
regulators or Congress.
   The NYSE study concluded that ``market volatility and program
trading are not the primary concern of individual investors, who
are more concerned about whether today's markets are operated
fairly and honestly.''
   Nonetheless, it said, ``the belief that program trading has
diminished the fairness of markets reduces investor confidence.''
   Among the NYSE proposals:
   _A four-tier ``circuit-breaker'' coordinated among the U.S.
stock, futures and options markets. Trading would stop for one hour
when the Dow Jones average moves up or down 100 points from the
previous day's close; 90 minutes when it moves 200 points; and two
hours each when it moves 300 points and 400 points.
   The halts are longer than ones previously imposed by the Big
Board. They would require approval by the NYSE, Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade.
   _Revising federal securities laws to make it easier for
corporations to buy back their own stock during market turmoil.
   _Develop new products that would enable individual investors to
protect themselves from extreme intraday price swings.
   _Improve the exchanges' ability to police intermarket trading
abuses.
   _Consolidating regulation of stocks and stock-related futures
under one federal agency to improve investor confidence. Similar
legislation is being considered by Congress.
   The panel admitted that trading abuses exist in the financial
markets but ``they do not appear to be embedded in the system. In
short, the markets are not `tilted' against the individual investor
_ or anyone else.''
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard S. Breeden
said he was ``extremely pleased'' the panel endorsed creating a
single regulatory agency for stocks and stock-derived futures.
   Breeden said the report ``in essence fully confirms''
legislation backed by the Bush administration that would give the
SEC authority over regulating stock-index futures.
   In a dissent filed with the report, Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Chairman Leo Melamed, a member of the panel, opposed the
single-regulator recommendation. He said ``a majority of the panel
simply mirrored a popular perception that consolidation of
regulation seems desirable.''
   Opponents of program trading criticized the report.
   ``It's simply an affirmaiton of the fact that the NYSE has
surrendered all of their hopes and dreams to the institutions,''
said Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Contel Corp. ``They've
accepted defeat without a fight.''
   In a survey of 560 people included in the report, more than 50
percent of respondents said they didn't pay much attention to the
stock market or thought it was ``stable'' or ``pretty good.''
   More than half of the respondents said they hadn't heard of
program trading. But among people who own stock and were aware of
the term, 32 percent said program trading makes it hard for small
investors to particpate in the stock market.
   On a rating of concerns, 58 percent of direct shareholders said
their biggest concern was the honesty and ethics of stockbrokers,
compared to 18 percent for market volatility and 11 percent for
program trading.
   The Big Board defines program trading as any order for the
simultaneous purchase or sale of 15 or more stocks. Index
arbitrage, a form of program trading, involves rapid trading of
stocks in New York and stock-index futures in Chicago to profit
from momentary price discrepancies.
   ``Empirical evidence suggests that index arbitrage is most
likely the messenger through which new information gets
incorporated into stock prices, but it is not the primary cause of
price changes,'' the panel concluded.
   ``Without index arbitrage, prices would still change, _ albeit
possibly more slowly _ with the arrival of new information,'' it
said.
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said the report would be voted
on by the exchange's board and its recommendations discussed with
other financial markets. Phelan said the he was confident the
Chicago futures markets would agree with most of the suggestions,
including the circuit-breakers.
   The panel included officials from Wall Street, major
corporations, state government and higher education.

   In another network attack on the current
``people meter'' ratings system, NBC on Tuesday announced its own
plan for giving sponsors free ad time when its television shows get
lower-than-promised ratings.
   NBC announcement, made less than two weeks after a similar
announcement by ABC, comes at a time the three networks are sharply
disputing lower ratings reported by the viewer-activated
``people-meter'' ratings system of A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Although Nielsen officials say last season's reported drop in
network viewing is real, the networks argue that the Nielsen data
is wrong.
   This has led NBC and ABC to use different statistical formulas
aimed at cushioning each network from financial losses caused by
the data from people-meters, which monitor viewing habits in 4,000
homes.
   NBC officials have estimated their network could lose as much as
$100 million next season because of the lower ratings.
   CBS expects to announce its own plan on Wednesday, said CBS
research vice president David Poltrack.
   The planned changes could leave advertisers and their
representatives facing three completely different network formulas
for dealing with so-called ``make-good'' agreements with
advertisers.
   Poltrack said he expected the strategy of advertising agencies
then ``would be to voice a preference for one plan over the others,
and hope that that would bring the networks in conformance with one
plan.''
   ``I think this will be resolved fairly quickly _ but I may be
wrong,'' he added.
   The network announcements come at the onset of the so-called
``up-front'' buying period by advertisers for next season, a period
that can be worth $4 billion of the estimated $10 billion in total
network sales for next season.
   The matter has gotten a lot of publicity, ``but it's not that
complicated,'' said John Sisk, senior vice president for network
negotiations at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency.
   ``We negotiate a lot of things with them (the networks)...this
will be part of the negotiations,'' Sisk said, referring to the
beginning ``up-front'' purchase of commercial time for the 1990-91
season.
   ``It's a major part of the negotiations, but only a part.''
   Sisk said he hadn't yet seen the details of NBC's plan, which
bases its formula for make-goods on television audience data going
back to 1982.
   ABC's plan uses a three-year average starting in 1987, when
Nielsen's people-meter system became the industry's national
standard.
   The system requires individual viewers in participating homes to
``log on'' to Nielsen devices when watching a TV set. The previous
passive system simply recorded what was being watched, but not who
was watching.
   Richard Kurlander, whose company buys commercial time for 110 TV
stations, declined to comment on NBC's announcement until the
network had provided him with its details.
   ``Obviously, there's some unhappiness, but it'll get all sorted
out,'' said Kurlander, vice president of programming at Petry
Television. ``I think we should wait until we actually sift through
it.''
   NBC's initial announcement was made in a corporate press release
that among other things spoke of the use of a ``standard linear
regression model'' in projecting television viewing levels for next
season.

<HEAD>Otto Sturzenegger, Chairman of U.S. Ciba-Geigy, Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ARDSLEY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Otto Sturzenegger, board chairman of the
U.S. subsidiary of the Ciba-Geigy pharmaceutical giant, has died of
cancer at age 64, the company announced.
   Sturzenegger died Saturday in Westchester County, company
spokesman Tom Chizmadia said.
   Sturzenegger's contributions to Ciba-Geigy Corp., the U.S.
branch of Swiss-based company, ``have formed the foundation upon
which this company has grown,'' said Richard Barth, president and
executive officer of the U.S. company.
   Ciba-Geigy Corp., based in the Westchester County town of
Ardsley, produces pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals,
plastics, dyes and vision care products. Its 1989 sales were $3.5
billion.
   Sturzenegger ``was the driving force behind our success over the
last two decades,'' Barth said.
   The Swiss-born executive began his career in 1952 in Switzerland
as a production chemist with the former J.R. Geigy company. Two
years later, he moved to the United States and took charge of that
company's manufacturing activities.
   Geigy merged with Ciba in 1970 to form the Ciba-Geigy Corp., and
Sturzenegger was named its president and executive officer.
   In 1978, he was named chairman of the board, and in 1986 he
retired as chief executive officer while retaining his title of
chairman.
   He also joined the board of directors of the parent company,
Ciba-Geigy Ltd., of Basel, Switzerland.
   Sturzenegger had earned a bachelor's degree in science from the
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, and
master's and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry from Oklahoma State
University. He also completed the Advanced Management Program at
Harvard University.
   Sturzenegger also was a board member of the NCNB Corp. until
April 1989, and was until his death a board member of a subsidiary
of the International Business Machine Corp. that serves Europe, the
Middle East and Africa.

   Share prices failed to hold early gains and ended
Wednesday morning's session lower on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
while the dollar rose against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 101.48 points, or 0.31
percent, ending the morning session at 32,220.83. The index, which
lost 217.87 points Tuesday, rose more than 100 points in early
trading before falling back.
   The dollar was changing hands at 154.68 yen at late morning. It
opened at 155.08 yen, up 0.68 yen from Tuesday's 154.40-yen close,
and ranged between 154.57 yen and 155.08 yen during the morning.
   ``Following the index's losses since Monday, as well as the
yen's weakness, the Nikkei quickly fell as participants stepped off
to the sidelines,'' said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a trader with New Japan
Securities Co.
   The index lost 453.11 points on Monday.
   Morimoto said participants' buying interest has shrunk due to
uncertainties over the movements in foreign exchange and bond
markets.
   Currency dealers said the dollar fluctuated around 155 yen level
as institutional investors bought the currency while exporters sold.
   Most market players, however, were reluctant to make major moves
ahead of a series of U.S. economic data to be released this week,
they said. Among the announcements are the nation's retail sales
for May, due later Wednesday, April merchandise trade and May
consumer and producer prices.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond inched up to 87.47 points from Tuesday's
close of 87.45. The yield edged lower to 7.08 percent from 7.085
percent.
