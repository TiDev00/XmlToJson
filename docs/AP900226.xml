   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant patient, was upgraded to serious condition Monday as she
continued to recover from her second liver transplant.
   Stormie, 12, of White Settlement, Texas, was moved from the
intensive care unit of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to a
regular hospital room.
   ``She's doing well. She regaining her strength quickly,'' said
hospital spokeswoman Lynn McMahon.
   Stormie was listed as critical Sunday afternoon, but was
upgraded to critical but stable after she was taken off a
respirator about 7 p.m. and was breathing on her own, Ms. McMahon
said.
   She had been placed back on a respirator Friday after fluid
began collecting in her lungs.
   Stormie received her second liver transplant a week ago Tuesday.
She returned to the operating room the next day, when doctors
operated to halt internal bleeding.
   Her first transplant, in 1984, was needed to control effects of
a rare disease that left her cholesterol levels 10 times greater
than normal. The second operation resulted from permanent liver
damage caused by hepatitis.
   Her donor heart has remained healthy, doctors said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henry Fairlie, a writer and contributing
editor for the New Republic, is dead of a heart attack and stroke.
He was 66.
   Fairlie worked as a feature writer for the Observer newspaper in
his native London and later was an editorial writer for the Times
of London.
   He had been a free lance since 1954, writing for The New York
Times, Harper's, the Atlantic, The Washington Post and other
publications.
   He also was the author of books on political affairs, including
``The Spoiled Child of the Western World,'' ``The Kennedy
Promise,'' and ``The Seven Deadly Sins Today.''
   Fairlie considered the political reputation of Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., greater than the senator deserved, and his
writing on that subject prompted outraged letters to the New
Republic.
   Fairlie devoted his last published column to the discovery of
contamination in Perrier water. He urged his readers to drink
Scotch whisky, ``made from nutritious whole grains,'' and
pronounced: ``No scotch has ever been found to be contaminated.''
   He died Sunday at George Washington University Hospital.
   He is survived by his wife, three children and five
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Witness to Drug Killing Slain Before Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who saw his companion die in a hail of
bullets allegedly fired by a drug gang was himself slain earlier
this month, apparently to make sure he did not testify against
those accused in the woman's murder, according to a published
report.
   John Shelton, 43, was gunned down Feb. 7 by a rifle-bearing
ski-masked killer who police believe was a hired hit man, The New
York Times reported in Tuesday editions, quoting unidentified
investigators.
   Shelton had witnessed the death of Maxine Peterson, who was hit
by gunfire nearly two years ago as she stood holding her baby in
the kitchen of her home in the New York City borough of Queens.
   Shelton had been living with Ms. Peterson at the time.
   He was to testify in the trial of Ms. Peterson's accused
murderers, which began Monday in state Supreme Court in Queens. The
prosecution and the defense presented opening statements without
mentioning Shelton.
   Michael Bethea, 18, was indicted in Shelton's murder.
   On trial in Ms. Peterson's murder are Gary Steadman, 24, Kevin
Gaines, 27, Raymond Blair, 21, and Keenan Wynn, 21.
   Shelton's murder is apparently the latest case of a witness
being murdered or menaced in Queens. Mildred Greene, 61, a
dispatcher for a car service, was shot to death in 1987 after
testifying before a grand jury about a gun battle that took place
outside the car service office.
   In another case, the home of a Guyanese immigrant was firebombed
twice after he complained about drug dealers. A police officer,
Edward Byrne, was later murdered while he guarded the house.

<TEXT>
   A youth driving a car he won for being
named the nation's safest teen-age driver may have fallen asleep at
the wheel before he and another driver were killed in a two-car
accident, police said.
   A car driven by Michael Doucette, 17, of Concord, drifted over
the center line and slammed into one being driven by Sharon Ann
Link, 19, of Lebanon, according to police reports.
   Both were pronounced dead at the scene Friday evening.
   Police said it appeared Link may have tried to swerve out of the
way before the collision in the extreme right side of her lane.
   ``Preliminary investigation shows (Doucette) may have fallen
asleep at the wheel,'' the police report said.
   A passenger in the Link vehicle was in stable condition Sunday
at Concord Hospital.
   Last July, Doucette won the safe driving title in a contest
called ``Operation Driver Excellence,'' sponsored by Dodge and
AMVETS, a veterans' group.
   He won a $5,000 scholarship, a trophy and the use for a year of
an 1989 Dodge _ the car he was driving Friday.
   Doucette, driving the winning car, was one of the attractions in
a New Year's Eve parade down Concord's Main Street.
   Concord High School Principal Charles Foley was shaken by the
news. ``He was just a fine kid from a good family,'' Foley said.
``It's heartbreaking.''
   After winning the competition last year, Doucette said the
contest was ``like a driver's test, only a lot harder.''

<TEXT>
   A portrait of a beardless Abraham Lincoln _ the
first portrait ever painted of him _ has been discovered by a
collector of Lincoln memorabilia, American Heritage magazine
reported.
   The portrait appears in the magazine's March issue.
   It was painted from life in 1856 by Dr. Philip O. Jenkins, a
physician and amateur artist, before Lincoln was nationally known,
collectors James L. Swanson and Lloyd Ostendorf said.
   Lincoln became president in 1861.
   Swanson tracked down the portrait in the Illinois home of an
86-year-old distant relative of the artist.
   ``There, at the end of the parlor, was Abraham Lincoln,
sixteenth president of the United States,'' he writes.
   ``But this was not bearded Father Abraham, the Great Emancipator
and Civil War president,'' Swanson said. ``It was the image of
another man, Abe Lincoln of Illinois, prominent lawyer and
ambitious politician.
   ``The canvas captured Lincoln as he would have looked in his
office, in court, or at a political event on any day in the 1850s _
clean-shaven, wearing a dark frock coat, white shirt and tie.''
   The article describes the processes Swanson went through to
verify his finding.

   The American Society of Newspaper Editors has
announced five winners of its 1989 Distinguished Writing Awards.
   The journalists, selected from among 500 applicants, will
receive cash awards of $2,500 each during the ASNE's annual
convention, April 3-6.
   The winners, announced Sunday, are:
   _ Terrie Claflin, staff writer for the Medford (Ore.) Mail
Tribune for non-deadline writing. Claflin wrote four stories that
chronicled the short life of a brain-damaged foster child whose
biological mother is a drug addict.
   _ Diana Griego Erwin, columnist for the Orange County Register,
Santa Ana, Calif., for commentary and column writing. Her columns
included one about a Hispanic laborer who had difficulty getting a
driver's license because of his poor English.
   _ Samuel Francis, The Washington Times, for editorial writing.
Some of the editorials written by Francis, who won the award for
the second straight year, focused on conservative themes such as
support for legislation establishing a review process for the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   _ Linnet Myers, reporter for the Chicago Tribune, state and
local government reporting. Myers wrote a three-part series
reviewing the parade of people through Chicago's criminal court
system.
   _ David Von Drehle, reporter for the Miami Herald, deadline
writing. Von Drehle was cited for his first-person account of
Hurricane Hugo's assault on Charleston, S.C.

<TEXT>
   Inside the former local Communist Party
headquarters, 17 opposition groups work under the same roof but
with different visions of how to rebuild East Germany after the
nation's first free elections next month.
   Environmentalists, feminists, the well-known New Forum and even
a lone conservative group all rent office space from the Communists
in the neo-Gothic building, renamed Democracy House after the
Communists moved out in January.
   ``It's a little chaotic here,'' campaign worker Jana Reuter of
New Forum said Friday. ``It's taking a while to get the hang of
things.''
   Others praise the camaraderie and conveniences of similar groups
working under one roof.
   ``For groups that work together, being in one building has big
advantages,'' said Thomas Voit of the leftist-oriented party
Democracy Now. ``It's easy to meet quickly and exchange ideas or
discuss campaign details.''
   With less than three weeks to go before the March 18 elections,
Democracy House's winding halls are buzzing with commotion.
   On the third floor Friday night, the conservative party
Democratic Awakening was having an organizational meeting. One
floor higher, leaders of the East German Greens gathered.
   It sometimes seems there's a party or group for everyone.
   The Social Democrats want to follow in the footsteps of their
Western counterparts, led by Willy Brandt. They are leading in the
polls.
   There are Christian Democrats, Free Democrats and the
Communists, although the latter have changed their name to the
pleasant-sounding Party of Democratic Socialism as they seek to
break from their Stalinist past.
   But there are others as well, including the United Leftists, the
Independent Women's Association and the Initiative for Peace and
Human Rights.
   Under present laws in East Germany, a political organization
does not have to be a party to run for or hold office.
   Some have warned that the splintering could lead to an inability
to govern.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has cautioned
the United States that difficulties are expected in forming an East
German government.
   ``It is conceivable that there will be no more (East German)
government after March 18,'' the Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt on
Friday quoted Schaeuble as saying.
   Some groups in Democracy House say they are aware of the
confusion but don't know how else to manage, given the brief time
until the elections _ and the pressing problems East Germany must
begin solving.
   Throughout East Germany, groups and organizations have been
running campaigns from makeshift offices, many of them lacking
essentials like typewriters, to say nothing of photocopying
machines.
   ``We're not pleased to have to work under so much pressure with
so little time,'' said Pastor Rainer Eppelmann, himself one of the
founding members of the pro-democracy movement and a minister in
the current caretaker government.
   His Democratic Awakening party has helped lessen the splintering
somewhat by forming an election alliance with two other
conservative parties. The alliance is supported by West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union.
   The alliance favors establishing a market-oriented economy,
monetary union and unification with West Germany as soon as
possible. ``Socialism Never Again!'' is one of its slogans.
   Three leftist-oriented groups in Democracy House also have
formed an alliance. New Forum and the Initiative for Peace and
Human Rights have teamed up with Democracy Now to form Buendnis 90
(Alliance '90).
   ``A market-oriented economy, yes _ but not as a dismantling of
social security. Unification, yes _ but not as annexation,''
Alliance '90 says in a campaign paper.
   The heady rush toward democracy in East Germany has forced the
emerging political groups to learn about democracy on the run.
   ``From the point of view of party organization, it would have
been better to hold the elections later,'' Eppelmann said with a
sigh. ``But considering the dynamic rate of developments here, the
March 18 date is a good thing.''

<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded at an army recruiting
office in this town northwest of London five days after a similar
attack in central England for which the IRA claimed responsibility,
police said today.
   Police in West Yorkshire, about 200 miles northwest of London,
said the recruiting office was empty at the time of the blast
Sunday night. They said the blast damaged the front door and a
window but injured no one.
   No one claimed responsibility for that attack.
   On Tuesday, a bomb injured two people in the central England
town of Leicester when it went off under an army vehicle which had
just driven away from a recruiting office.
   The outlawed Irish Republican Army later said it planted the
Leicester bomb.
   After that explosion, Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head
of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad, warned military personnel
and people in public life to beware of bombings in mainland Britain
by the IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland.
   In September, an IRA bomb killed 10 members of a band at the
Marine barracks in Deal in southeast England.

   Gunmen armed with automatic rifles
burst into a wake and shot to death seven men, including a brother
of the man being mourned, police said.
   The police said they believed Sunday's attack in the Seaview
section of Kingston stemmed from a feud between rival youth gangs.
They said the gunmen were armed with M-16 assault rifles and other
semi-automatic weapons.
   The attackers raided the wake before dawn Sunday, forcing seven
of the 50 people present to lie on the floor and shooting them in
the head, police said.
   The national security minister, Keith D. Knight, said the police
had launched a manhunt for the killers.
   Prime Minister Michael Manley, in a statement issued Sunday
night, condemned the killings as ``senseless and heinous.''

   Spike Lee says sex, not race, will generate a
lot of heat in his new film, ``Mo' Better Blues.''
   ``The audience may squirm,'' Lee said in the March 5 issue of
People magazine.
   The $10 million film starring Denzel Washington is about a
trumpet player torn between his love of music and his desire for
two women, a singer played by Cynda Williams and a Harlem
schoolteacher played by Lee's sister, Joie.
   Joie Lee said she had no problem working with her brother in
scenes that called for nudity.
   ``When he said, `Okay, take off your top,' I just did it. It's
not perverse,'' she said.
   Williams said the love scenes are tasteful, ``but when I think
of going to see the movie with my parents and grandparents, it
freaks me out.''
   Lee's last film, ``Do the Right Thing,'' examined racism with a
tragic confrontation at a pizza parlor.

   Former Olympic skier Suzy Chaffee has been
touring the country speaking out against animal-rights activists
who would ban the sale of fur coats.
   For the past three years, Chaffee, 43, has helped design and
promote a collection of fur-lined skiwear called Suzy Chaffee Sport
Furs.
   She spoke in Aspen, Colo., before the recent defeat of a
proposed ordinance that would have banned the sale of furs in the
resort community, and has been appearing on talk shows.
   ``My credibility is very important to me, and I feel I am really
being responsible to the animals and to nature and to the
environment because trapping them is better than letting them die
the disease-and-starvation route,'' she said.
   Chaffee, better known to the public as ``Suzy Chapstick''
because of her television commercial for lip balm, skied in the
1968 Winter Olympics and was a three-time world freestyle champion.

   So what should Marla Maples, the alleged ``other
woman'' in billionaire Donald Trump's marital mess, expect from her
involvement in the scuffle?
   Not much, said some other ``other'' women interviewed by People
magazine in its March 5 issue.
   After word of her sexual liaison with television evangelist Jim
Bakker, Jessica Hahn posed for Playboy for $1 million, was host of
a mud-wrestling contest and now receives at least $2,000 for
personal appearances.
   But Hahn told Maples, ``Unless he's prepared to marry you, and I
don't think he is, you're better off just keeping your feet on the
ground and pursuing your career.''
   ``Nothing can beat paying your own bills,'' Hahn said.
   Lobbyist Paula Parkinson, whose alleged relationship with
Delaware Rep. Thomas Evans cost him his congressional seat, also
posed for Playboy but rejected a television movie offer.
   Her advice to Maples? ``If you are having an affair, it's going
to end, darling. It doesn't turn into love and marriage.''

   Andrew Young, who is trying to become
Georgia's first black governor, took to the pulpit at a rural
Baptist church where the whites were the Sunday regulars and the
blacks were the guests.
   The service at the First Baptist Church was a twist on the
decades of white politicians' preaching at black churches, with
white visitors sitting in the pews.
   Young, a former ambassador to the United Nations and a former
Atlanta mayor, is a Congregationalist minister.
   He took his text from Paul's letter to the Ephesians: ``For he
is our peace, who has made us both one, and has broken down the
dividing wall of hostility.''
   During the sermon, Young spoke of a ``transformation of our
politics'' that has worn out the metaphor of America as a melting
pot.
   ``We're all in the same pot, but it is not so much like a least
common denominator soup. It is more like a stew _ our differences
only enhance and enrich,'' he said.

   The Romanian revolution has been the
bloodiest and most chaotic of the upheavals in the Soviet bloc.
   Some of the turmoil seems to stem from the nation's history of
brutal authoritarianism, but government critics say mistakes by
Romania's new leaders have also played a role.
   Two months after its anti-Communist uprising, Romania's fragile
governing coalition is struggling to keep the peace. Several
violent demonstrations saw hundreds of people storm government
headquarters.
   On Wednesday, a National Peasants Party official said two party
activists had been killed in recent weeks, apparently for political
reasons. In May elections, that traditionally anti-Communist party
will likely prove the strongest challenger to the National
Salvation Front.
   The front took power after the overthrow and execution of
President Nicolae Ceausescu and has since added other parties to
its provisional government.
   None of the other five rapidly democratizing countries in the
East bloc have seen the violence Romania has. Hundreds, perhaps
thousands, are thought to have died in revolutionary battles
pitting revolutionaries against Ceausescu.
   No other country, however, had a Ceausescu. Under a
quarter-century of his rule, Romania's 23 million people slid deep
into economic misery and suffered political repression unmatched
elsewhere in the bloc.
   Before Ceausescu, Romania was under the control of one dictator
or another for most of its 2,000-year history, save for 60 years of
political pluralism at the turn of the century.
   The effect of the long period of despotism was to rob Romanians
of even the slim experience with democracy that many other Eastern
European countries had.
   After World War II, under Ceausescu, the Communist dictator's
repression of government opponents wiped out any major opposition
leaders who could fill the power vacuum after his downfall Dec. 22.
Other Eastern European nations had at least some strong dissidents
who survived their Communist regimes.
   ``Ceausescu's disastrous political legacy is still haunting
us,'' Octavian Paler, a leading writer and editor of the newspaper
Romania Libera, said in a recent editorial. ``We must pay a high
price for the lack of a non-Communist opposition: suspicion, fear
and little democratic tradition historically.''
   After the revolution, rivalries broke out between supporters of
the National Salvation Front and its opponents.
   A loose grouping of ex-Communists, technocrats and former
dissidents, the front ran the country alone for a few weeks. But
its initial reluctance to share power enraged major opposition
parties and wide sectors of the population, who feared the
relatively high proportion of Communists in its ranks made it a
possible vehicle for a new totalitarian takeover. The front was
eventually forced to share power with nearly 40 new political
parties.
   Suspicion of front motives increased after interim president and
front leader Ion Iliescu said the group _ which most people viewed
as only an interim government _ would take part in the May 20
elections. Initially, it had said it had no plans to do so.
   Following a violent pro-front demonstration Jan. 29, several
opposition parties accused the front of Communist tactics, such as
busing in truckloads of supporters, blaming the other parties for
violence and buying support with money and whiskey.
   The front moved to redress many grievances during its six-week
tenure as the country's sole government.
   It replaced Ceausescu's most hated laws, opened the borders for
Romanians to travel, allowed protest demonstrations, lifted
censorship and released political and ordinary prisoners.
   But even those moves drew criticism.
   ``They let free the thieves and ordinary criminals and now it's
dangerous to move around freely after sunset,'' said Marin Stelian,
a Bucharest typographer.
   Adding to the distrust is fear that vestiges of the horrible
past continue to exist.
   A group of 46 intellectuals expressed worry in early February
that Securitate secret policemen who terrorized the country under
Ceausescu still wield secret power.
   In an open letter to the new Council of National Unity, which is
to act as a parliament until the elections, the intellectuals said
nobody can talk about the victory of the revolution ``when fear,
physical and psychological threats go on.''
   The depth of concern about the future was evident in remarks
made by Iliescu in the wake of the Feb. 18 demonstration, in which
some soldiers attempting to keep the mob away from government
headquarters were injured.
   ``If the army and police don't have the legal ability to
maintain order, people will feel it necessary to defend themselves
_ we could become like Lebanon, and anarchy could lead us to total
chaos,'' he said in a public address.
   Romania's only previous brush with democracy occurred in a
60-year span that began in the 1880s. Political parties were
allowed to operate under a constitutional monarchy, but even then
the king remained the main figure in decision-making until the Nazi
takeover in 1940 and full totalitarianism.

   B.T. Collins says he's living proof that
malathion poses no health risks to Southern Californians, whose
neighborhoods are being sprayed with the pesticide to wipe out the
crop-destroying Medfly.
   As head of the California Conservation Corps during a 1981
Medfly infestation, Collins was so sure malathion was safe that he
drank a diluted glass of it in front of corps members wary about
picking malathion-sprayed fruit.
   ``I offered to do it again,'' said Collins, now an
alive-and-well state chief deputy treasurer. ``I don't think the
citizens in Los Angeles have a clue as to how disastrous it could
be if that fly gets to Bakersfield,'' at the foot of the
agriculturally-rich Central Valley.
   Perhaps the state should consider taking him up on his offer.
Little else has persuaded Southern Californians that aerial
malathion spraying should continue to protect agricultural areas
from the Mediterranean fruit fly.
   As one city after another joined the revolt last week against
the aerial spraying, state officials were faced with a severe
credibility gap and no apparent sign of converting the dubious.
   Critics and supporters of the spraying say the public relations
effort has suffered from a late start, some bad press, a
media-savvy opposition and mixed and muddled messages from
officials.
   ``I'll tell you, they lost an enormous amount of credibility in
Pasadena,'' said city director Rick Cole, who complained the state
broke its promise to finish spraying before commuters leave in the
morning for work.
   The Department of Food and Agriculture ordered the spraying of
400 square miles following the discovery of Mediterranean fruit
flies last August.
   Officials say the eradication program is needed to protect
California's $16.5 billion agricultural business. They also say the
sticky mixture of malathion and corn syrup bait poses no health
risk in small, heavily diluted doses. A third of an ounce of the
mixture is dropped over an entire city block.
   ``It's safe. It's safe. It's safe. We've been saying it over and
over again,'' said Gera Curry, a Food and Agriculture Department
spokeswoman.
   But Southern Californians aren't buying the message.
   A recent Los Angeles Times poll found that 57 percent of Los
Angeles and Orange County residents want the spraying stopped, and
only one in seven strongly support it.
   Part of the problem, critics said, is that the state failed to
spend enough time explaining its position on health risks and did
not listen to concerns before the spraying began.
   State officials said they had to move quickly because any delay
in spraying _ even under court order _ could prove fatal for
farming.
   ``The Medfly won't wait for a temporary restraining order,''
said Dr. Peter Kurtz, a senior medical coordinator with the Food
and Agriculture Department.
   While the state hurried to spray, opponents built momentum.
   They were aided by media reports damaging the state's position,
including charges by the coauthor of a state study who said it was
edited to understate the health risks. The report was often cited
to support claims that malathion is safe.
   In recent weeks, a grass-roots effort led mainly by concerned
homeowners has grabbed attention by recruiting famous faces, such
as most of the cast of television's ``Cheers.''
   Politicians responded by holding public hearings on malathion
spraying, and scientists countered the official line that malathion
is absolutely safe.
   ``I think that aerial spraying in densely populated areas is
absolutely ridiculous,'' said Dr. Donald Dahlsten, a University of
California-Berkeley entomologist in testimony before the Los
Angeles City Council.
   The state also has used scientists as spokespeople, but that has
posed its own problems: Scientists are reluctant to speak outside
of their area of expertise or to give the kind of absolute
assurances nervous people want.
   ``If you're a scientist you don't use the word `safe,''' said
Ms. Curry, the agriculture department spokeswoman. ``The word
`safe' is not in a scientist's vocabulary.''

   Despite ominous government warnings and a high
police profile, pro-democracy activists marched by the hundreds of
thousands in more than 30 Soviet cities to demand an end to
one-party Communist rule.
   The rallies Sunday, unprecedented in scope in the Communists'
72-year rule, came a day after voters in the independence-minded
republic of Lithuania apparently stripped the Communists of their
parliamentary majority. The day also saw republic-wide elections in
another restive republic _ Moldavia.
   A series of official warnings last week that extremists would
provoke violence kept the turnout low in some cities Sunday and
prevented some protests altogether. Riot police dragged away people
who tried to hold an unsanctioned demonstration in Leningrad, but
there were no reports of major unrest.
   ``We heard about tanks, about police waiting with gas and
shovels,'' said a middle-aged woman who was not deterred from
demonstrating Sunday in Moscow along with more than 100,000 people.
   Thousands of uniformed police and internal security troops
guarded the authorized march route in Moscow. Sand-filled dump
trucks, water trucks and snowplows blocked all approaches to the
Kremlin. About 17,000 police and Interior Ministry troops stood by
with nightsticks and water cannons, eventually relaxing and
stashing their riot gear.
   ``All was against us,'' Gavril Popov, a member of the Congress
of People's Deputies, told the crowd in Moscow's Zubovsky Square.
   He accused the Communist Party and state apparatus of
engineering a campaign of fear not seen since Stalin in an attempt
to thwart the outpouring of popular sentiment for a swift change to
democracy.
   Demonstrators demanded democratic reforms ranging from direct
popular election of the president to the establishment of private
property and creation of a multiparty system.
   One demonstrator charged that the Sunday morning broadcast of a
Polish science-fiction film called ``The Sex Mission'' _ with
nudity rare on Soviet TV _ was a deliberate attempt to entice
people to stay home.
   The protests were planned after a successful Feb. 4
pro-democracy rally in Moscow in which about 200,000 people
demanded the Communist Party give up its monopoly on power.
   Party leaders voted to do so shortly afterward, but the day when
the Communists must compete with other parties for the right to run
the country appears far off to many Soviets. The Communists, with
their long-established omnipresent patronage system, still firmly
control the government and economy nearly everywhere.
   Reports from police, local activists interviewed by telephone
and state-run media indicated as many as 276,000 people took part
in protest rallies in 32 cities outside Moscow, from
Petropavlovsk-Kamchatky in the Soviet Far East to Leningrad on the
Baltic Sea coast.
   In Moscow, red, blue and white flags of czarist Russia fluttered
along with red and black flags of anarchists and the sky-blue cross
on a white background of the Memorial Society, which is dedicated
to remembering Stalin's victims.
   ``General, are you with the people?'' shouted a woman in the
crowd to a stocky Interior Ministry officer directing crowd control
at Gorky Park, one of the gathering points for the march.
   ``Sure, I am!'' replied Maj. Gen. Georgy Postoyuk. Contrary to
widespread rumors that authorities planned to provoke violence to
justify a crackdown, he said officials worked closely with rally
organizers and the result was ``a very good, orderly meeting.''
   Speakers urged demonstrators to endorse progressive candidates
running in March 4 parliamentary elections in the Russian
federation and demanded the ouster of members of the ruling
Politburo and Council of Ministers, as well as KGB chief Vladimir
A. Kryuchkov.
   With a show of hands, the crowd voted in support of a platform
presented by historian and parliament deputy Yuri Afanasyev that
proposed a direct presidential election, the establishment of
private property and turning over state media from party control to
editorial collectives.
   ``We're fed up with how we live,'' said one demonstrator,
Celestine Langovaya, a music teacher in her 50s. ``When (Mikhail
S.) Gorbachev first came to power, I believed in him, but things
have gotten worse for millions of people.''
   The Novosti Press Agency said 100,000 people gathered in Minsk,
the Byelorussian capital, for the largest turnout reported outside
the Soviet capital.
   Only about 8,000 demonstrators showed up at the officially
authorized rally site in Leningrad, the nation's second-largest
city. Leaders of the pro-independence People's Front movement there
had urged followers to boycott the event because authorities would
not grant permission to demonstrate on a downtown street.
   Riot police far outnumbered a small group that did try to
demonstrate in downtown Leningrad without official permission.
Officers broke up the attempted protest and dragged demonstrators
aboard waiting buses.
   Authorities in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don
refused to allow rallies, and about 100 dismayed activists gathered
near the local Communist headquarters to hand out leaflets, the
official Tass news agency said.
   Military authorities in Azerbaijan banned all demonstrations,
fearing a renewal of the nationalist violence that led to ethnic
warfare between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in January.
   About 2,000 were said to have gathered in the central Siberian
city of Krasnoyarsk, but activists there said many people went to
the wrong places because state-controlled media had refused to
report plans for the rally.
   Elsewhere, local activists said 50,000 people rallied in
Georgia's capital of Tbilisi and 12,000 in the large Siberian city
of Novosibirsk. Another 18,000 people attended two rallies in the
Urals city of Sverdlovsk, they said.
   Demonstrators in Tbilisi tore down street signs of a street
named after Lenin and renamed it for a Georgian dissident killed in
a car crash last year, a political activist said.
   About 50,000 Ukrainians gathered in Kiev, said Victor
Linchevsky, a spokesman for the grass-roots organization Rukh.
   On Saturday, Lithuanian voters appeared to have chosen the
country's first legislature not dominated by Communists.
   Unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided,
candidates endorsed by the Sajudis reform movement took 72 seats
and non-Sajudis candidates took 18, said Rita Dapkus, head of the
Sajudis information agency.
   Moldavians voted Sunday in their first free elections under
Soviet rule and expressed hopes their new Parliament would be able
to win greater sovereignty from Moscow.

<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange took its
second-largest tumble ever Monday, representing to many dealers the
beginning of an anticipated collapse of artificially high stock
values here.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average shed 1,569.10 points, or 4.5
percent, to fall to 33,321.87 at the close of the trading day. This
was the index's second largest decline in points and the lowest it
has fallen since July 5, 1989, when it closed at 33,309.71 points.
   Volume was light at 400 million shares on the first section.
   The market's main index dropped 2,569.35 points, or 6.86
percent, last week, and 4,024.9 points, or 10.34 percent, since the
beginning of the year until Monday.
   In Washington, a U.S. official said Sunday night that the
Treasury Department and Federal Reserve were monitoring the
situation on the Tokyo stock exchange but that no special actions
had been taken by U.S. authorities.
   Kazuhiro Nomura of New Japan Securities Co. said the stock
market's plunge in the last week showed that ``the bubble
phenomenon had finally burst.''
   Stock purchasing by investors on borrowed cash at low interest
rates had inflated share values, he said.
   But a sharp rise in interest rates last year spelled an end to
obtaining easy cash. The Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank,
raised the key discount rate three times last year, and it now
stands at 4.25 percent.
   Ken Schoenholtz, an economist for Solomon Brothers Asia Ltd.,
said share prices have been out of line with the higher interest
rates instituted by the Bank of Japan last year.
   The decline in the Nikkei shows ``the market getting adjusted to
high yields that are likely to stay,'' Schoenholtz said.
   The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was at 7 percent
at midday, up slightly from its 6.98 percent opening.
   ``With the dollar trading at 148.45 yen, we expect a further
decline in bond prices, especially with an auction coming up
tomorrow,'' said Doug Schumway, a trader at Jardine Fleming
Securities in Tokyo.
   Trading was light. The possibility of a substantial decline,
Schumway said, would depend on the volatility of the foreign
exchange market.
   Dealers have also attributed the continuing fall in the Nikkei
to fears of an additional interest rate hike by Japan's central
bank and a wave of computer-aided selling by arbitrageurs.
   They said an increase in the Bank of Japan's discount rate is
expected shortly because of higher inflation in recent months and
rapid growth in the money supply.
   Japanese market participants have also singled out the growing
usage of program arbitrage trading by foreign securities companies
as contributing to increased market volatility.
   In arbitrage trading, dealers profit from differences in prices
for the same security in different markets, for instance, the spot
and future markets.
   Some dealers have even singled the two U.S. securities firms
Solomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley as the principal users of
arbitrage trading in Japan.
   But Solomon's Schoenholtz disagreed that program selling was
responsible for the fall in the Nikkei.
   ``I doubt that you'd see such extreme market movements that
weren't related to the fundamentals,'' he said.
   Schoenholtz said the decline represented that compression of the
earnings yield gap between the equity and bond markets.
   As of the middle of last week, he said, the yield on stock
issues averaged 1.5 percent, whereas the yield on bonds was as high
as 7 percent.
   ``Three percent gaps in yield have been sustained for a
considerable amount of time, but 5 percent have not,'' he added.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar was quoted at 148.50
yen, up 2.03 yen, at 12:29 p.m. After opening at 147.50 yen, the
currency moved between 147.72 yen and 148.70 yen.
   ``Participants have no confidence in buying the yen because of
negative factors involving the currency,'' said Junichi Kodama, a
trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo. Political uncertainties and the
Tokyo Stock Exchange's crash of last week are the major reasons
that many investors are staying away from the Japanese currency, he
added.
   The Bank of Japan bank was seen Monday morning making a
dollar-selling intervention in the Sydney market before the Tokyo
market opened, in an attempt to support the declining yen. The
amount of selling was not clear because the bank does not comment
officially on its monetary activities.

<HEAD>Bush, Kohl Say United Germany Would Remain in NATO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, following ``extraordinarily frank'' talks at Camp
David, say the world has nothing to fear from a united Germany and
promise it will stay tethered to the Western military alliance.
   Emerging Sunday from two days of talks at the presidential
retreat, Bush and Kohl sought to allay fears from Moscow to Warsaw
to London that the two Germanys are marching to the altar too
rapidly.
   Bush said they shared ``a common belief that a unified Germany
should remain a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, including participation in its military structure,''
but with ``a special military status'' for the territory of what is
now East Germany.
   Kohl, without mentioning NATO by name, said, ``The alliance of
free democracies in Europe and North America ... are of fundamental
importance for peace and security. This is true now. This will be
true in the future.''
   Kohl also ruled out a Warsaw Pact connection for the new
Germany, saying, ``A united Germany cannot belong to two different
pact systems.'' He added, ``We will have transition situations''
which will have to be negotiated.
   The Soviets now have 380,000 troops stationed in East Germany,
which holds parliamentary elections March 18 that are expected to
speed the union of East and West Germany.
   Kohl reiterated that a neutral Germany is out of the question.
   ``Neutralism would be a very false solution,'' said Kohl, adding
that his country learned that lesson the hard way after World War
I. The isolation of the Weimar Republic was followed by the terror
and militarism of Hitler's Third Reich.
   Poland, decimated by the Nazis in World War II, has expressed
fear a united Germany might demand old lands back.
   On that score, Bush said the United States regards the current
European borders, including Germany's long border with Poland, as
inviolable.
   Kohl said the border question ``will be settled definitely by a
free elected all-German government and a freely elected all-German
parliament.'' He said he cannot speak now for what the German state
will decide.
   But Kohl emphasized, ``nobody has any intention of linking the
question of national unity with changes in existing borders.''
   Bush said the U.S. position ``is not to be afraid of German
reunification,'' but to understand the longing of the German people
to end the artificial division imposed after World War II.
   ``We've already crossed that bridge. We welcome reunification.
But it's not for the United States to set a timetable. It's not for
us to say how fast,'' said Bush, who acknowledged that events ``are
moving faster than we expected.''
   He called the talks with Kohl ``extraordinarily frank.'' Both
leaders said they saw no need to add Poland to the group of four
nations that will discuss reunification with the two German states.
Poland, like East Germany, has abandoned its communist monopoly
government.
   The allies which defeated Germany in World War II _ The United
States, Soviet Union, Great Britain and France _ have agreed to
convene meetings that are likely to lead to a unified Germany,
perhaps as soon as this year.
   Bush and Kohl fielded questions from reporters for nearly an
hour in a recreation hall at Camp Greentop, just down the road from
Camp David atop the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.
   Kohl said West Germany had proven its commitment to democracy in
the last 40 years as ``a loyal and reliable partner in human rights
and the defense of freedom.'' He said he had put his own political
existence on the line in supporting the deployment of U.S. Pershing
missiles in West Germany in 1983.
   Kohl also noted that he favors ``the political union of Europe''
and ceding more authority to the European parliament.
   ``In other words, we want this united Germany to be ever more
embedded in an integration process with its neighbors. So nobody
needs to be afraid,'' said Kohl.
   Bush, asked what he would do if Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev refused to allow a united Germany in NATO, said, ``We
will do what Lyndon Johnson did: We will reason together. And it
will all work out.''
   The White House also announced over the weekend that Bush will
meet with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Friday and
Saturday in Palm Springs, Calif. Kaifu's Liberal Democratic party
won a vote of confidence from the Japanese people in last week's
parliamentary elections.
   ``It's very important now that he's solidified his position'' to
hold such talks, Bush told reporters Sunday night at a dinner for
governors.

<HEAD>Airlines to Require Safety Seats for Infants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Erin Donnell has flown on airliners four times
in six months and she's never had to buy a ticket. She's also never
had a seat of her own during takeoff or landing. She's 6 months old.
   But if airlines have their way, Erin won't be allowed to fly in
her mother's arms between Washington and Rochester, N.Y.
   The airline industry's Air Transport Association last week
joined calls from members of Congress, consumer safety groups and
flight attendants for a rule requiring safety seats for all
passengers under 2 years old.
   If safety seats are made mandatory, Erin's mother, Judy Donnell
of Alexandria, Va., might have to buy a $130 ticket for a seat
where she could strap in the child restraint.
   Some travel agents say many travelers can't afford the extra
expense, and a Federal Aviation Administration official said the
proposal likely would do little to improve infant air travelers'
safety.
   The proposal would affect the 5,000 to 10,000 babies who fly
each day. In most cases, the same safety seats that states now
require for infants riding in cars can be used in a jetliner.
   The FAA proposes only to require that airlines offer use of
safety seats as an option to travelers _ as most airlines do now _
but the agency is seeking public comment on the tougher proposal.
   Mrs. Donnell said she would be willing to pay the extra cost,
but she has never considered buying a ticket to guarantee her baby
a seat.
   ``It's really mind-boggling that they think a baby is going to
be safe not secured,'' she said, adding that she sometimes straps
Erin into an extra seat during flight but holds her unsecured
during takeoff and landing.
   Other passengers apparently are not so content with the prospect
of having to carry a safety seat and buy a ticket for a child under
2.
   ``People are mostly concerned about having to pay,'' said Doris
Davidoff, a Bowie, Md., travel agent whose firm books 10,000
tickets a year. ``They'd like to have a choice and don't want it to
be mandatory.''
   ``I really don't think it would be fair, given the really low
percentages of injuries or deaths involved, to force the many, many
parents traveling with infants to pay these fares,'' said Mrs.
Davidoff.
   A passenger flying roundtrip between Baltimore and Los Angeles
at full fare could have to pay up to $1,246 on a heavily booked
flight to guarantee a seat for an infant. If the ticket were bought
far enough in advance at a discount, the cost still would be at
least $406, unless special child's fares were in effect.
   The FAA also is concerned about the burden such a rule would put
on travelers.
   ``The number of accidents is statistically low to begin with,
and there has been no indication that a great many children have
been killed,'' said FAA spokesman Fred Farrar.
   ``We don't think there is any safety justification for either
requiring the airlines to give up a seat for free or for requiring
a parent to purchase a seat if they don't want to,'' Farrar said.
   The problem is that in an air crash, ``A baby becomes a
ballistic,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., cosponsor with Rep.
Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, of legislation to force the FAA to require
safety seats.
   Much of the new concern was prompted by the death of
23-month-old Evan Tsao in the July 19 crash of United Flight 232 in
an Iowa cornfield.
   The boy's mother, Sylvia Tsao, survived the crash, while the
toddler died of smoke inhalation. Proponents of the seat rule say
he might have lived if he'd been strapped in next to his mother.
   A Harvard Medical School study in the early 1980s estimated that
three infants might be saved over five years if all children used
safety seats on airliners. No group has come up with statistics on
injuries to unsecured infants.
   Airline representatives say mandatory seats wouldn't necessarily
mean the end of free flights for babies and it could lead to more
family discount packages. Last summer, several airlines offered
free seats for up to two children under age 18 traveling with an
adult.
   ``Each airline will handle it differently, but I'd be amazed if
anybody gives away those seats,'' said David Brown, spokesman for
Southwest Airlines.

<HEAD>Attorney to Seek Return of Morgan's Passport</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, embroiled in a child
custody battle that now spans two continents, wants a judge to
return her passport so she can travel to New Zealand where her
ex-husband arrived today for family court hearings.
   Morgan's attorney, Stephen Sachs, said he would file court
papers today asking D.C. Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to
return the passport.
   It was Dixon who ordered Morgan, a 42-year-old plastic surgeon,
jailed for 25 months for civil contempt of court for failing to
obey his order to reveal the whereabouts of Hilary Foretich, now 7.
   Hilary, who became the focus of an intensive 2{-year search by
her father, Eric Foretich, was found living with her maternal
grandparents in Christchurch, New Zealand, this weekend.
   The child was sent underground amid allegations by Morgan that
Foretich sexually abused their daughter. He has adamantly denied
the allegations and no court has sustained Morgan's assertions.
   Sachs said he questions whether Morgan's passport was legally
seized in 1986 and said it should be returned.
   ``It (the passport) should have been returned,'' said Sachs.
``There was no lawful basis to keep it even before the child was
discovered in New Zealand.''
   Elaine Mittleman, Foretich's attorney, said Sunday she would
oppose the motion to return Morgan's passport.
   ``Why should she have her passport returned when she's still in
contempt of court in the District of Columbia?'' said Mittleman.
   Meanwhile, Foretich arrived in New Zealand from Washington today
and was traveling to Christchurch for a court hearing.
   ``Certainly, we're going to do what we need to do to rescue my
daughter,'' the New Zealand Press Association quoted him as saying.
   Morgan filed a civil suit in federal court in August 1986
against Foretich and his parents, claiming that the grandparents
also had abused the child. The grandparents filed a counterclaim
for defamation. After a lengthy trial, the jury ruled against each
side's claim.
   Later that month, Judge Dixon conducted a hearing on continued
allegations of abuse. He then ordered Morgan to jail for refusing
to allow Foretich to visit their daughter. Morgan was released
after three days by the D.C. Court of Appeals, which required that
she surrender the deed to her home as bond and turn over her
passport.
   From February 1987 to August 1987, Morgan complied with the
court order and allowed her husband a series of supervised visits
with Hilary, Sachs said.
   ``She did comply with the then-existing order for supervised
visitation,'' Sachs said. ``She purged herself of that (1986)
contempt (claim). For several years, there's been no lawful basis
to hold her passport.''
   The Court of Appeals first asked that Judge Dixon consider the
passport issue in the summer of 1987, he said.
   ``But by that time, she was jailed for the contempt again, and
our job was to get her out of jail,'' Sachs added.
   Sachs said since Morgan was released from jail in September
1989, he has sent two letters to Dixon requesting the passport be
returned, but the requests had gone unanswered.

<TEXT>
   Hampden County Sheriff Michael J. Ashe
had been known best for innovative programs like a jail garden
teaming inmates and senior citizens.
   Then came the day he seized a National Guard armory to house
inmates from his overflowing jail.
   The move by the mild-mannered, soft-spoken lawman with a
master's degree in social work has been applauded by guards,
judges, and even prisoners. He's become a hero on radio talk shows.
And he's been catapulted into a confrontation with state officials.
   But Ashe, who never misses a wake or a wedding and once sneaked
off to a McDonald's to fill up after a dinner at the White House,
says he has never fancied himself a rebel.
   ``I've always been a team player,'' he said. ``For the past 15
years I've been here we've worked very, very hard in a professional
way to try to manage the severe overcrowding.''
   ``We've looked in closets, in the garage and under the stairs.
And we've had prisoners in all those places. But there comes a
point where you run out of a `little magic.' And you just have to
go into the ring,'' he said.
   Ashe reached the end of his patience after he had jammed 726 men
into space built for 279 inmates following more than a year of
turning loose hundreds of prisoners to try to meet a 500-inmate
limit established by a federal judge.
   ``It came down to a moral and ethical thing,'' Ashe said. He
said he could no longer live with the fear of having one of the
prisoners he released kill or maim.
   ``The system had collapsed. And someone had to do something.''
   He acknowledged the timing of his move on the armory _ the day
before the three-day Presidents Day weekend began _ was calculated.
He installed 15 prisoners in the armory and had public opinion
solidly in his corner before stunned state officials could respond.
   State officials said late last week they would not challenge his
occupation of the armory for at least two weeks while they look for
other housing.
   For more than a decade, Ashe's knack of mixing toughness and
progressive social programs has kept a lid on the century-old
lockup.
   ``He believes inhumanity and coddling arrive at the same
point,'' jail spokesman Richard McCarthy said. ``In no way is he
going to allow anyone to lay in a cell all day.''
   ``Whatever they decide on, in consultation with their social
worker, whether it is one of the vocational programs or working in
the kitchen, the men have to answer the bell every morning just
like John Q. on the street and just like they will have to do when
they get out,'' McCarthy said.
   One of Ashe's first efforts on taking over the jail in 1975 was
to turn his jail quarters into a 60-bed pre-release center where
inmates with only six months to serve get extensive vocational,
substance-abuse and other counseling.
   In 1986, he added a day reporting center, one of the first of
its kind in the country, where inmates with four months left to
serve can be released on a electronic monitoring program that lets
them live at home as long as they report in several times a day.
   More than 1,500 inmates who have passed through his jail have
earned high school equivalency diplomas. He also started one of the
few job programs to operate in a county jail. Last year office
furniture manufacturing returned $200,000 in profits to the county,
McCarthy said.
   Before he became sheriff, Ashe and his wife, Barbara, a high
school sweetheart, were the first in a program started by the
Catholic Church to help homeless children. They have five sons and
one daughter.

<HEAD>1989 Posts Second-Best Farm Export Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frigid weather chilled December shipments a
little, but 1989 still was the second-hottest farm export year on
record, thus adding further stature to trade policy debate on
Capitol Hill.
   Overall, the Agriculture Department tallied farm export values
at just under $40 billion, up 7.7 percent from 1988. That was the
best dollar performance since 1981 when export values were a record
$43.3 billion.
   Exports in December remained strong but did drop $94 million
from the November level.
   ``Unusually cold weather contributed to the decline,'' the USDA
reported. ``Decreases in corn, soybeans, meat, rice, fruits, nuts
and tobacco more than offset increases in wheat, animal feeds,
soybean meal, cotton, vegetable oils, barley and cattle hides.''
   Although the tabulation was for the calendar year, the
department bases its annual forecasts and most analysis on figures
for the fiscal year, which runs from Oct. 1 through the next Sept.
30.
   In the last fiscal year, for example, farm export values totaled
about $39.7 billion, also the most since 1981. The forecast for the
1989-90 fiscal year is for exports to decline to around $38 billion.
   The report last week by the department's Economic Research
Service did not include a forecast for calendar 1990.
   But in reviewing what happened in 1989, the agency noted that
last year's commodity export value represented ``the third
consecutive year-to-year increase since exports bottomed out at
$26.2 billion in 1986, the low point for the 1980s.''
   Exports have been recognized for many years as vital to American
farmers and are a central issue in the Bush administration's
strategy for 1990 farm legislation.
   Ongoing multilateral Uruguay Round negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are aimed at reducing
barriers that impede exports and imports.
   Meanwhile, several USDA programs, notably the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, have been used to boost U.S. shipments into
selected countries where foreign competitors _ mainly the European
Economic Community _ have been selling products at subsidized
prices.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told the House Agriculture
Committee last week that the 1990 farm bill should extend export
programs that have helped boost U.S. exports since the current farm
law was approved in 1985.
   But Yeutter added that ``after completion of the Uruguay Round
all programs will be reassessed.''
   Yeutter said the administration wants to continue EEP, which
offers designated U.S. commodities to selected target countries at
subsidized prices. But he said the program should be reauthorized
without mandated levels or programming requirements.
   ``We want our competitors, especially in the European Community,
to know that we stand ready to use this program to the maximum
extent,'' he said. ``We want them to phase out their export subsidy
practices which have severely distorted world markets for many
years.''

   Americans are smoking fewer cigarettes, but an
Agriculture Department economist says demand continues to grow in
the rest of the world.
   Last year, the per capita use of cigarettes in the United States
was estimated at 2,936 ``pieces'' or fewer than 149 packs of 20
cigarettes each, down about 5 percent from the 1988 rate.
   The per capita use has declined for 16 straight years, said
Verner Grise of the department's Economic Research Service. At its
peak in 1963, use averaged 4,345 cigarettes, or more than 217 packs.
   Per capita consumption is based on all persons 18 or older,
smokers and non-smokers alike. It does not indicate actual smoking
habits and is used by the agency for year-to-year comparisons.
   But world cigarette trade increased about 12 percent, Grise said
in the March issue of Farmline magazine.
   ``Shipments from the United States, West Germany, the
Netherlands, Hong Kong (which is also an importer) and the United
Kingdom were up, while those from Bulgaria and Belgium-Luxembourg
were down,'' he said. ``Together, these seven countries account for
about 84 percent of total world exports.''
   Among the cigarette importing countries, the most important
markets are the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, Hong Kong and
Turkey.
   During the first nine months of 1989, U.S. cigarette exports
were up 16 percent from a year earlier, with all the major markets
buying more, Grise said. In the ``relatively small markets,'' sales
also rose in South America but declined in Australia-Oceania and
Canada.

   Australia, one of the world's biggest meat
producers, is consuming less of its beef and lamb, according to an
Agriculture Department dispatch from Canberra.
   ``They are eating more breakfast cereals, desserts, fruits and
vegetables, but less meat, bakery products and canned vegetables,
according to a recent survey,'' the report said.
   As reported in Retail World, an Australian publication, the
value of retail purchases of meat and deli items dropped 33 percent
from 1988 to 1989, while bakery products and canned vegetables each
declined 14 percent.
   But purchases of breakfast cereals rose 25 percent; desserts, 20
percent; and fruits and vegetables, 22 percent.
   The item was reported in AgExporter magazine by the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service.

   In this city where the Communists
seized power seven decades ago, about 8,000 people ignored rumors
of impending violence and rallied to demand that the people be
allowed to choose their leaders.
   At a second rally on Sunday, riot police dragged away several
pro-democracy protesters who tried to gather in the city's center
without official permission.
   The authorized demonstration was part of nationwide protests
demanding radical political and economic reforms.
   A resolution passed by a show of demonstrators' hands and a
resounding ``Da!'' said the president should be chosen by the
people, not the party apparatus, and urged voters in Russian
parliamentary elections next Sunday to vote in pro-democracy
candidates and ``tear power from the apparatus.''
   ``In February 1917, we started on the road to democracy. In
October, we got dictatorship. Now there is a similar situation,''
Ilya Konstantinov, a candidate for parliament, told the crowd
outside the Lenin Sports-Concert Complex.
   Leningrad, the site of three uprisings while it was capital of
the Russian Empire, has been dubbed the ``cradle of revolution.''
In 1905, czarist forces fired on demonstrators demanding democratic
reforms in a clash known as ``Bloody Sunday.''
   Sunday was the anniversary of another uprising, the 1917
February Revolution, in which bourgeois-democratic forces seized
power and forced Czar Nicholas II to abdicate. The Bolshevik
Communists, led by Vladimir I. Lenin, took over eight months later.
   An hour before the rally at the sports complex, about a dozen
activists in the Democratic Union, a radical group fighting to end
the Communist Party's hold on power, gathered on a square.
   As about 100 police surrounded the crowd and KGB plainclothes
agents stood by, an officer shouted through a megaphone that no
demonstration was authorized.
   A dozen riot police wearing white helmets and green bulletproof
vests then dragged away several of the activists, who had no
protest posters and had not made any public statements.
   The activists were loaded onto buses for detention. A
parliamentary candidate and Associated Press photographer Dominique
Mollard also were taken away but later released after their
identification documents were checked.
   One activist climbed atop a yellow construction crane and
unfurled a cloth banner that referred to next Sunday's elections.
``Boycott _ It's your First Step to Freedom!'' it read.
   Five riot police mounted the crane and dragged down the
protester.
   Leaders of The People's Front, Leningrad's biggest pro-democracy
group, decided to boycott the authorized rally because they feared
retaliation from either the government or right-wing groups.
   But dissenting People's Front members showed up and harshly
condemned their leaders' decision.
   Writer Mikhail Chulaky, a People's Front member, told the crowd
that the Communist Party's decision earlier this month to end its
monopoly on power was overdue and added: ``The party of genocide
must be disbanded, like (Germany's Nazi party) was disbanded by
Nuremberg.''
   Under Stalin, thousands of political opponents were murdered.
   Several speakers attacked President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal to strengthen his powers as president. ``Again they are
wrapping a dictator around our necks,'' said Nikolai Ivanov, a
parliamentarian from Leningrad whose crusade against official
corruption has made him popular.
   A protest banner equated the presidency with fascism, a powerful
comparison in a city where 600,000 people were killed by the Nazis
in World War II.
   Police and plainclothes KGB agents did not interfere in the
second rally.

   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
underdog in Sunday's election, was showing surprising strength and
could upset President Daniel Ortega, according to a polling expert
for the Los Angeles Times.
   The Times was conducting a ``quick count'' of a representative
sample of precincts nationwide for the presidential race.
   ``She's showing surprising strength and there exists the
possibility of an upset,''said I.A. Lewis, the Times polling expert.
   Lewis refused to release any details or figures of the poll. He
spoke as concern rose about the extremely slow reporting of
election figures by the nation's Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
   Mrs. Chamorro, candidate for the U.S.-backed opposition
coalition, trailed Ortega of the leftist Sandinista party in polls
conducted before the election.
   But those polls were not considered a sure indicator of victory
because Nicaragua is a rural country where polling is difficult.
Nicaraguans are reluctant to tell strangers what they think after
45 years under the Somoza family dictatorship and 10 years under
the highly disciplined Sandinistas.
   The Los Angeles Times conducted a ``quick count'' by selecting a
representative sample of precincts and having results from those
precincts telephoned to a central office in Managua.
   ``The precinct sample indicates the possibility of a dramatic
upset,'' said Lewis.

   Getting agreement in Washington on the need
for a civil rights bill is proving almost ridiculously easy. But
it's a little tougher to find an accord on what the measure should
say.
   ``I don't believe we have to overhaul the American legal system
to ensure equality,'' says Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   He and other conservatives say the sweeping proposal backed by
the civil rights community to remedy workplace bias against
minorities and women goes too far and needs to be limited in scope.
   And yet, civil rights supporters say the Supreme Court itself
overhauled much of the U.S. civil rights law last year in a series
of rulings on job bias cases.
   Civil rights forces say those decisions _ from a Supreme Court
whose conservatism deepened considerably in the Reagan era _
represent the most severe setback in years for civil rights in the
workplace. They say the bill they support would merely restore the
previous legal standards.
   The Supreme Court rulings came at a time when opinion polls show
an easing of worry about civil rights among white Americans. And
that may in part explain the bill's popularity on Capitol Hill.
   It has gained broad sponsorship in both the House and Senate,
including more than a smattering of Republicans.
   Critics contend the measure is guaranteed to usher in racial
hiring quotas, an idea that would be much harder to sell in
Congress. But sponsors declare that nothing in the bill's language
requires hiring quotas.
   Almost everyone agrees change is needed. ``I have no doubt that
more needs to be done to combat the evil of discrimination in our
society,'' says Hatch. As a senior member of the Senate Labor and
Judiciary Committees, he could play a pivotal role in any eventual
negotiations on the issue.
   The Bush administration already is recommending a bill that
would overturn two of last year's decisions. But that does not
satisfy Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and other bill sponsors.
   ``The administration cannot stop there or its response will be
inadequate,'' says Kennedy.
   The administration and the bill sponsors agree that something
must be done about the Supreme Court's decision in the so-called
Patterson case.
   The case concerns Brenda Patterson, a former credit union filing
clerk from Winston-Salem, N.C. She said her bosses harassed her and
discriminated against her for a decade because she was black.
   ``I was actually told to dust and sweep the office, even though
we had a janitor every day and no white employees were ever told to
do this,'' she said.
   The court ruled that the alleged harassment and discrimination
was not against the law and that a Civil War-era statute, under
which she had brought suit, did not apply in the case. The reaction
against the decision has been so overwhelming that it appears all
but certain the law will be changed.
   But other cases are more complex.
   The Lorance case involves discrimination in company seniority
plans. The Martin vs. Wilks decision focuses on court-approved
fair-hiring agreements.
   Civil rights forces and conservatives may be most at odds over
whether changes are needed as a result of the Wards Cove case,
which involved alleged hiring bias at an Alaska salmon cannery.
   Before the Supreme Court's decision, employers defending
themselves in hiring discrimination cases had to be able to prove
they based their actions on business necessity.
   Now, however, those who file such lawsuits must prove that the
employer did not act out of business necessity.
   ``By shifting the burden, the Supreme Court has made it far more
difficult and expensive for victims of discrimination to challenge
the barriers they face,'' declares Kennedy.
   Harvard law Professor Charles Fried, however, says Kennedy's
proposed remedy is itself flawed.
   First, an individual filing such a suit would not be required to
pinpoint which of the employer's hiring practices was the source of
the discrimination. Fried says that would encourage lawyers
representing alleged bias victims to unfurl a long list of
practices and thus force the employer to defend all of them.
   Also, he adds, the bill would require the employer to prove that
each practice was essential for staying in business. That could
prove too difficult, says Fried. ``I'm afraid they're going to say,
`Gee, we don't want to fuss with this. We'll just hire by quota,'''
he said.

<HEAD>Governors Oppose Giving Federal Anti-Drug Funds Directly to Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City officials have a tough sell when they try
to convince governors to loosen their grip on federal funds for
combating drugs.
   ``I strongly support the idea that some of the federal dollars
go directly to some of our larger cities,'' Mayor Richard L.
Berkley of Kansas City, Mo., told governors Sunday.
   In his appearance at the annual midwinter meeting of the
National Governors' Association, Berkley was careful to emphasize
he was talking about only ``some'' dollars and ``some'' cities.
   But an Associated Press survey of governors found them almost
unanimous in their opposition to relinquishing their hold on the
flow of federal funds to their states.
   They were equally united in praise of President Bush's effort to
help them combat drugs, particularly his willingness to sharply
increase his budget request for the effort.
   ``President Bush's drug program is a bold attempt to deal with
this menace in a comprehensive way,'' said Republican Gov. James
Martin of North Carolina.
   Gov. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, said the
president's program ``is beginning to provide states with the help
they need.''
   One of the few dissenters was Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt
of Oregon who said the president's program ``supplies the guns we
need in the war on drugs but not enough bullets for them. Not
enough resources are being dedicated to any one of the areas.''
   ``I would oppose sending federal money directly to local
governments,'' said Gov. William Donald Schaefer of Maryland, a
former mayor of Baltimore. ``The problem is not confined just to
our larger cities.''
   Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin said that while some cities
might benefit from direct funds ``more cities would benefit from
having the states administer grant awards.''
   ``The state's direct involvement in the allocation of dollars
promotes coordination and avoids duplication of efforts,'' said
Gov. James Thompson of Illinois.
   Appearing with Berkley were Mayors Wilson Goode of Philadelphia,
Sue Myrick of Charlotte, N.C., and Maureen O'Connor of San Diego.
   Goode said cities often must wait months from the time federal
funds are allocated for drug programs to the time when they
actually receive the money.
   ``Get those federal dollars where they're needed most,'' he said.
   ``We mayors want direct funding for cities because it doesn't
always get down to us,'' said Myrick. O'Connor put the waiting
period at anywhere from 12 to 18 months.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina said cities were ``out
of line'' in assuming they have a far greater need for drug funds
than rural areas.
   ``We have a terrible problem outside the cities,'' Campbell said.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana was a little more sympathetic to
the mayors.
   ``That is a valid complaint if state government is going to
ignore the cities, ignore their wishes and not work with them hand
in glove,'' he said.
   However, he added that ``It's invalid in the sense that the drug
problem is nationwide, statewide and not just citywide and there
needs to be some coordination.''
   Gov. Evan Bayh of Indiana said direct funding to the cities
``makes it difficult to coordinate either the state or local
effort.''
   Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder rejected sending money directly
to cities because the problem is ``so pervasive that the state has
a responsibility.''

<HEAD>Defense Spending Neutral to U.S. Economy, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reducing U.S. defense spending will have no
more impact on the economy than cutting money for education, health
and other programs, says a report issued today.
   Using previously published data, economist David Gold concludes
that on average over the past four decades, ``defense spending has
been a relatively neutral feature of the American economic
landscape.''
   Gold's findings differ from the accepted belief that reducing
the defense budget, which in the latest Bush administration
proposal totals $292 billion for fiscal 1991, will generate revenue
for other programs and trigger economic growth.
   ``Cutting the defense budget will have no more of an impact on
U.S. investment, research and development, innovation,
productivity, international competitiveness and economic growth
than will cutting other forms of spending, both public and
private,'' Gold said in the report.
   The economist, who works for the United Nations Centre on
Transnational Corp., conducted the study while serving as
consultant for the Defense Budget Project. The non-profit think
tank released Gold's report.
   ``The report challenges the conventional wisdom on both sides
regarding the impact of defense spending,'' said Gordon Adams,
director of the Defense Budget Project.
   The report said cuts in defense spending may provide funds for
other programs, and if properly handled, the economy could benefit.
However, ld questioned the argument that the defense budget should
be cut to promote economic growth.
   the defense budget may lie elsewhere, in such problems as
wastsmanagement, and in the debate over the actual requirements for
military forces in a rapidly changing world,'' Gold said.
   Gold also disputed the claim that defense requirements for
research and development talent have weakened productivity in the
private sector. According to the report, the number of scientists
and engineers who have left civilian work for the military sector
has declined in recent years despite the defense buildup of the
1980s.

<HEAD>Reagan Says He Did Not Think Letters to Congress on Contras Were
False</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan, supporting former
aides John Poindexter and Robert McFarlane in videotaped testimony,
says he didn't think letters they sent to Congress about U.S. aid
to the Contras were false.
   In his testimony for Poindexter's upcoming trial, the former
president said he instructed that ``whatever we did'' to maintain
the Nicaraguan Contras ``should be done within the law.''
   But Reagan said he was unaware his own Tower Commission
concluded three years ago that Oliver North was giving military
assistance to the Contras. And, Reagan said he did not know that
McFarlane had pleaded guilty to withholding information from
Congress for denying North's role.
   ``I have a great deal of confidence in the man who was quoted as
sending these letters, McFarlane,'' Reagan testified. ``I have
never caught him or seen him doing anything that was in any way out
of line or dishonest.''
   ``Do you remember that Mr. McFarlane ... has pled guilty in open
court to withholding information from Congress in connection with''
his written denials to Congress? asked Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan
Webb.
   ``No, I was not aware of that,'' replied Reagan.
   ``Mr. President ... did the Tower Commission not tell you'' that
``Oliver North and your National Security Council were involved in
1985 and 1986 in assisting the Contras militarily?'' asked Webb.
   ``I don't recall that,'' said Reagan.
   Poindexter, facing trial March 5 on charges of conspiracy,
obstructing Congress and making false statements, sent responses to
Congress in 1986 that embraced McFarlane's letters of the previous
year.
   In his videotaped deposition, released last Thursday, Reagan
asserted that he didn't think Poindexter had obstructed Congress.
   ``Did you ever ... give authority to John Poindexter to make any
false statements to any congressional committee? asked Webb.
   ``No,'' replied Reagan. ``And I don't think any false statements
were made.''
   Reagan's comments on behalf of Poindexter were blunted in part
by the written answers he gave two years ago to Iran-Contra
investigators. The responses, provided to a federal grand jury
conducting a criminal investigation of the affair, depicted a
president who had been misled by subordinates.
   In those answers, Reagan said he had heard allegations in the
press that North was assisting the Contras militarily during a
congressional ban on U.S. military aid, but that he understood the
allegations were incorrect.
   ``Who told you that the allegations in the press about North
being involved in assisting the Contras was false or incorrect?''
Webb asked Reagan during the videotaped deposition, referring back
to Reagan's written answers.
   ``It could have been ... the late Bill Casey from CIA,'' said
Reagan. ``It could have been Admiral Poindexter. It could have been
some people from the Defense Department, or all of the people that
were involved in some way'' in seeking support from Congress for
the Contras.
   The former president supported the McFarlane letters on six
different occasions in his videotaped testimony.
   ``I understand exactly what he (McFarlane) is saying here,''
said the former president, ``and I think it is in agreement with''
what Reagan said were his repeated admonitions to his aides _ that
they comply with the law.
   One of the McFarlane letters stated that ``none of us'' at the
NSC ``facilitated contacts with prospective donors, or otherwise
organized or coordinated the military or paramilitary efforts of
the resistance.''
   After Reagan repeatedly appeared unable to understand that
McFarlane's letters were false, U.S. District Court Judge Harold
Greene interrupted Webb and tried to explain the matter to the
ex-president himself.
   McFarlane's letter ``could be interpreted that other way'' as
being false, Reagan finally conceded. But the former president
added that he had not interpreted it as being false.
   Poindexter is accused of lying to Congress on Nov. 21, 1986, by
saying that no one in the U.S. government knew that a November 1985
shipment to Iran contained Hawk missiles until after the weapons
were delivered. However, documents at North's trial last year
showed that North helped arrange the shipment and kept Poindexter
informed of its progress.
   Reagan announced on Nov. 19, 1986, that ``all information will
be provided to the appropriate members of Congress'' about the Iran
initiative.
   ``You agree with that statement?'' Webb asked Reagan.
   ``Yes,'' replied Reagan. ``Except that I cannot ... recall
whether there were things that then came up that made us have to
hold our revelations'' to protect the lives of U.S. hostages held
in Lebanon and Iranians with whom the U.S. government was dealing.
   ``There were times and experience that told us that Congress was
not in many instances capable of the kind of security that we
required,'' he said.

   A program to raise youngsters' interest
in history by querying Abraham Lincoln prompted one to ask, ``What
was it like being on a penny?''
   Officials for the letter-writing program enlisted Jeannine
Perez, a teacher at the Illinois State University child-care
center, to play Lincoln's ghostwriter and answer the queries from
students in kindergarten through second grade.
   Ms. Perez had little trouble addressing some of the more popular
questions, such as ``How does it feel to live in a log house?''
   But when one youngster asked, ``Did you have electricity, or
radios, or Nintendo or computers?'' Ms. Perez' Lincoln had to ask
them questions about Nintendo and computers.
   Another youngster asked Lincoln, ``Were you friends with Martin
Luther King Jr.?''
   Ms. Perez' Lincoln replied, ``I didn't ever meet Martin Luther
King, but I would imagine that we would have a lot to talk about.''
   A first-grader asked, ``Were you afraid when you started first
grade?''
   Ms. Perez told the student about Lincoln's school, which had
schoolmasters who snapped a switch if the students misbehaved.
   Ms. Perez said she would not classify herself as a Lincoln
scholar but as a person interested in history. After consulting
several Lincoln books, she has yet to complete all her responses.
   The program was sponsored by the McLean County Historical
Society.

   Everybody's heard of the country doctor
being paid with chickens, but how about the lawyer who's paid with
goat meat?
   While many attorneys are wary of accepting merchandise for their
services, some say they sometimes find themselves stuck between
accepting items other than cash _ or getting nothing at all.
   Helena attorney Nick Jacques said he has received a few
haircuts, and once ``a guy gave me some goat meat.''
   While hesitant to try the meat, Jacques said it turned out to be
a tasty payment once barbequed on his grill.
   Lawyer Mark Staples said, ``I was paid with a motorcycle for a
divorce I handled and rode it around for nearly six months before I
realized you needed a special permit. Now, it sits in a storage
area.''
   And attorney Mayo Ashley said he has accepted paintings, wall
hangings and books, among other items.
   ``One person offered me a car to take his criminal case,'' said
Ashley, who declined. ``But I've gotten several golf balls and golf
clubs.''
   ``You can always turn away a person who doesn't have money, but
I guess I'm too soft-hearted,'' Ashley said. ``I've probably lost a
lot of money that way.''
   And then there's the case of Helena artist Bruce Donald Bunger,
who was unable to pay a $500 fine for growing marijuana.
   His attorney and prosecutors struck a deal last October in which
Bunger would satisfy the fine by donating a sculpture of a buffalo
head and eagle called ``The Emergence.'' Ironically, the sculpture
will sit in front of the old jail, which is being renovated to
house an arts center.

<HEAD>Thousands Toss Flowers, Chant For Duarte As Former President

   Carrying photos of Jose
Napoleon Duarte and tossing flowers at his flag-draped coffin,
thousands of mourners paid final respects to the former president
eulogized as ``the father of Central American democracy.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Presidents Oscar Arias of Costa Rica
and Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and former President Jose Azcona
Hoyos of Honduras attended the funeral Mass for Duarte, who died
Friday of cancer at age 64.
   President Alfredo Cristiani did not attend the services Sunday
because he was in Taiwan on a state visit. Leaders of Duarte's
centrist Christian Democratic Party criticized Cristiani's rightist
government for not declaring a national day of mourning.
   At least 100,000 people paid their last respects to the former
president, party leaders said.
   Duarte's followers, many carrying photographs of the former
president and cheering, ``Duarte! Duarte!'' tossed flowers at his
flag-draped coffin as it was carried from the Roman Catholic church
to a 21-gun military salute.
   Arias and Cerezo were among the pallbearers at his burial.
Arias, remembering Duarte's key role in regional peace talks,
called him ``the father of Central American democracy.''
   ``Napoleon was a visionary pioneer and an untiring fighter for
democracy,'' Arias said at the Mass.
   Cerezo referred to criticisms of Duarte's 1984-1989 term as
president but said, ``I think the magnitude and value of his work
still has not been fully appreciated.''
   He ``gave his life for the cause of all democrats of Latin
America,'' Cerezo said.
   Duarte, who tried but failed to end a civil war and ease El
Salvador's searing class division, died at his San Salvador home
after fighting stomach and liver cancer for almost two years.
   Fidel Chavez Mena, who succeeds Duarte as the Christian
Democratic leader, criticized the government as ``niggardly'' for
not declaring a day of mourning but added: ``the people were in
mourning, anyway, which is the important thing.''
   Cristiani, who represents the oligarchy that Duarte has fought
for decades, took over as president in June after his conservative
Nationalist Republic Alliance, or Arena, defeated the Christian
Democrats.
   Armando Calderon Sol, mayor of San Salvador and Arena president,
said: ``Duarte was an expression of democratic will. He made great
contributions toward the democratization of the country.''
   ``We have been strong adversaries,'' Calderon said. But, he
added, ``It would be unjust not to recognize President Duarte's
palpable efforts for human rights (and) struggle for freedom of
expression.''
   After founding the Christian Democratic Party, Duarte was
tortured and exiled for seven years. He returned in 1980 and headed
a civilian junta until he was chosen president in 1984 in the
country's first elections in 50 years.

   High winds and clouds forced NASA to
abandon its fifth attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis on a
secret military mission Monday morning, the most postponements
since the ill-fated Challenger mission.
   ``Launch director Bob Sieck informed the launch team that we are
scrubbing for the day,'' Lisa Malone, launch control center
commentator, said at 2:31 a.m. ``There is no hope that the weather
will clear in time to support a launch today.''
   Before the mission was scrubbed, forecasters had said there was
only a 40 percent chance the shuttle could be launched early Monday.
   The mission was postponed until at least Wednesday morning
because the numerous delays had left both the crew and the launch
team fatigued, NASA said.
   As launch time approached, wind gusts up to 31 mph buffeted the
launch pad, about 1 mph above the usual allowable limits. Winds
that were too high might have blown the shuttle into the launch
tower, destroying the spacecraft.
   At about 12:40 a.m., Sieck called for an extended hold, hoping
that the winds would subside before the available launch period of
about 90 minutes expired.
   While that determination was made, clouds moved over the runway
where Atlantis' crew would attempt an emergency landing in case of
a problem shortly after liftoff. Mission Control said the clouds
were unacceptable for launch.
   The all-military astronaut crew arrived at the launch pad
shortly after 10 p.m., just as they did before Saturday night's
mission was scrubbed.
   The launch already had been delayed four times by a combination
of bad weather, a cold that felled Atlantis commander, Navy Capt.
John O. Creighton, and a faulty computer that halted the count just
31 seconds before liftoff on Sunday.
   The five delays were the most in a shuttle launch since the
Challenger, which was postponed seven times and launched on the
eighth try to explode shortly after lift-off Jan. 28, 1986, killing
all seven astronauts.
   Despite the gloomy forecast, shuttle managers in midafternoon
had given the go-ahead for the launch team to pump 528,000 gallons
of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into Atlantis' cavernous fuel
tank for another try.
   Contributing to the decision to load fuel was the fact that
Monday offered the best weather odds of the next three days. The
odds drop to just 20 percent on Tuesday and Wednesday, forecasters
said.
   Clouds could block a spectacular view of the liftoff for
residents on the East Coast as far north as New Jersey; in clear
weather, they could see the shuttle's fiery exhaust climbing on a
course a few hundred miles off the coast.
   Bad weather and the illness of Atlantis' commander resulted in
postponements Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The weather was
perfect early Sunday before liftoff was halted by the computer
problem with 31 seconds to go.
   The computer is one of two used by the Air Force to provide
information on the shuttle's course after liftoff. If the vehicle
strayed off track and threatened a populated area, a range safety
officer would send a radio signal to blow it up so pieces would
fall harmlessly into the Atlantic.
   Mission rules require that both computers be operating for a
launch, with the one that failed serving as a backup.
   Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman, reported Sunday that
the trouble had been traced to bad software.
   ``The computer is up and we're ready to support a launch,''
Warren said.
   The astronauts, who spent three hours in the spacecraft before
Sunday's scrub, went to bed about noon.
   The commander is Navy Capt. John O. Creighton, who was felled
two days last week by a sore throat and nasal congestion. His
all-military crew is Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and
mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Because the mission is classified, neither NASA nor the Pentagon
will identify its purpose.
   But sources who spoke on condition of anonymity reported that
the astronauts were to deploy on the second day a 37,300-pound,
$500 million satellite capable of taking super-sharp photos and
listening in on military and diplomatic communications around the
world.
   In covering most of the Soviet Union, the satellite would be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with current and future
arms agreements.
   NASA and the Pentagon planned to maintain a news blackout
throughout the flight, unless there was a major problem.
   Two announcements were planned, one about three hours after
liftoff to report that orbit had begun and another 30 hours into
the flight with the date and time of landing.
   The flight was expected to last four days, with landing at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.

   Aided by a sophisticated underwater
video camera, divers spotted and retrieved the body of the last of
seven victims who died after plunging into an icy lake.
   The body of Dave ``Grandpa'' Meyers, one of four would-be
rescuers who perished trying to save three teen-agers who fell
through thin ice on Lake Convict on Feb. 19, was recovered Sunday.
   Divers recovered the other six bodies last week.
   Meyers, 53, of Bishop, was a counselor at Camp O'Neal, where the
three teen-agers were residents. Also killed were another
counselor, a volunteer firefighter and a forest ranger.
   Camp O'Neal, near the lake in the Sierra Nevada 250 miles north
of Los Angeles, is a home for youngsters placed by county
social-service agencies as well as youths who have committed minor
crimes and are on probation.
   Meyers' body was spotted by a sophisticated underwater video
camera lowered into the lake on Wednesday, but the water clouded
over before divers could go down to recover it. The camera was
lowered into the lake again Saturday, but only clothing and
eyeglasses were spotted.

<HEAD>Candidates in 1990 Senate Races Already Have Raised $62 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Senate incumbents raised more than $3
million each last year in preparation for this year's elections,
according to federal statistics that show total fund-raising of $62
million by all candidates.
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas topped the list with nearly
$6 million in contributions, according to the analysis released
Sunday by the Federal Election Commission.
   Others in the top four were Sens. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., with
$4.7 million; Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., with $3.6 million; and Paul
Simon, D-Ill., with $3.3 million.
   Twenty-two candidates reported contributions of more than $1
million, all of them incumbents except for three Republican House
members and Texas Democrat Hugh Parmer, a state senator taking on
Gramm.
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., reported raising $1.5 million for her
challenge to Simon. The FEC said GOP Reps. Hank Brown of Colorado,
running for an open seat, and Tom Tauke of Iowa, contesting
incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin, also raised more than $1 million
apiece last year.
   The FEC report covered 31 incumbents and 29 challengers, plus 10
candidates in three open-seat races in Colorado, Idaho and New
Hampshire. The agency said the candidates reported raising $62
million and spending $28 million during 1989.
   By comparison, candidates in 33 Senate races in 1984 had spent a
little more than $35 million in 1983.

<HEAD>Juries Tougher Than Judges On Convicted Felons, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More people convicted of felonies by state
court juries wind up in prison and stay there longer than those
found guilty by judges, according to a new report.
   The Justice Department analysis issued Sunday also found that 89
percent of convicted felons plead guilty and that they spend less
time in prison than those who go to trial and are convicted by a
judge or jury.
   The penalties of life in prison or death are meted out to 47
percent of those convicted by juries of murder or non-negligent
manslaughter. Meanwhile, only 15 percent of those who pleaded
guilty to such charges and 12 percent of those found guilty by a
judge received those penalties, said the report by the department's
Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   It is unclear why defendants convicted by juries were more
severely punished, the study said. But it noted that ``a higher
percentage of the convictions by juries were for violent offenses.''
   It said defendants in serious cases, violent and nonviolent, may
have been less willing to plead guilty because they expected severe
penalties. ``In addition, prosecutors may have recommended and
judges may have imposed shorter sentences for those who pled
compared to those found guilty by trial,'' it said.
   The study _ based on information from 100 counties in 37 states
regarding all convicted felons sentenced in 1986 _ cautioned that
the findings should be considered preliminary because of the
limited sample size. The next survey is to cover 300 jurisdictions.
   Of the estimated 583,000 people convicted of a felony in state
courts in 1986, 89 percent pleaded guilty, 8 percent were convicted
by a jury and 3 percent were found guilty by a judge, the report
says.
   But many of the guilty pleas were for lesser offenses, with 92
percent of the larceny convictions and 90 percent of the burglary
convictions based on guilty pleas, but only 58 percent of the
murder convictions and 68 percent of the rape convictions based on
such pleas.
   Felons convicted by a jury were sentenced to an average of 159
months in prison, compared with 103 months when felons were
convicted by a judge and 72 months for those who pleaded guilty.

<HEAD>1990s Said Crucial Decade for Population</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of people on Earth will double in
39 years unless birth control becomes available to everybody by the
end of the decade, according to a new study.
   ``This is a preventable disaster,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice
president of the private Population Crisis Committee, a
Washington-based advocacy group that released the report Sunday.
   ``We have what it would take _ the financial resources and the
know how _ to solve the problem, and to do so in our children's
lifetime. But we have to act immediately. We cannot dither away
another decade.''
   There are about 5.3 billion people in the world, a figure that
the United Nations says could rise to 14 billion before stabilizing
in the next century. The committee said today's population could
double in 39 years and reach 27 billion by the end of the 21st
century if present birth and death rates continued unchanged.
   Stopping population growth at about 9 billion to 10 billion
people would require use of contraceptives by some 75 percent of
couples, the study estimates. But to accomplish that the products
would have to be available to everyone by the end of this century
so the average family size could fall to about two children per
couple early in the 21st century.
   The report goes on to estimate the cost of such an effort _
$10.5 billion per year by the year 2000. Currently $3.2 billion is
spent on family planning in developing countries, where most
population growth is taking place.
   ``Universal family planning is a bargain compared to the costs
of delaying world population stabilization,'' Camp said.

<HEAD>New Cambodian Peace Talks Come After Guerrilla Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's warring factions gathered
today for talks on ending their 11-year-old conflict, the
Vietnamese-installed government bolstered by battlefield victories
against non-Communist guerrillas.
   The three days of talks were expected to focus on a possible
role for the United Nations in reaching a settlement. With little
else on the negotiating table, Asian diplomatic sources said the
meeting would be a success only if the U.N. role were approved at
least in principle.
   A ceremonial opening was planned in the evening after the
arrival of Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, a co-host with
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas of Indonesia.
   A 19-nation peace conference in Paris last summer opened with
high hopes only to deadlock, largely on the question of how power
would be shared by the Hanoi-backed government of Premier Hun Sen
and the three-member guerrilla coalition.
   Hun Sen has said he would allow the United Nations to organize
elections but not administer the country until polling takes place.
His government has opposed U.N. participation in peace efforts in
the past because the world body recognizes the guerrilla coalition
as the legitimate government of Cambodia.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978, ending nearly four years
of rule by the Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of
peopl as it tried to turn the former French colony into a radical
agrarian commune.
   The Vietnamese claim to have pulled all their troops out of
Cambodia in September.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of the guerrilla
coalition and there are fears of a recurrence of brutal rule if its
fighters were to topple the Hun Sen government.
   Representing the guerrilla coalition at this week's talks are:
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, on behalf of the faction of his father,
former head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk; Khmer Rouge Vice
President Khieu Samphan; and former Premier Son Sann, head of the
Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
   Also on hand are Hun Sen, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co
Thach and representatives from Laos and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations: Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   As the participants gathered, news reports quoted non-Communist
guerrilla commanders as saying they suffered major battlefield
losses at the hands of the Phnom Penh army. They blamed a halt in
arms supplies from China for their predicament.
   China has been the main supplier of arms to the three guerrilla
factions. It was unclear whether the interruption, confirmed by
Western diplomats in Bangkok, was due to logistics or a policy
decision.
   The guerrilla commanders said that, because of their inability
to stop a government counteroffensive in northwestern Cambodia,
thousands of civilians under their control were moving closer to
the Thai border.
   The Soviet Union has been the main supplier of weapons to
Vietnam and the Cambodian government.
   Khieu Samphan said in a statement Sunday that more than 20,000
Vietnamese troops had been sent back into Cambodia since Hanoi
announced that all of its troops were withdrawn in September. The
Vietnamese troops wore the uniforms of Hun Sen's army, he said.
   Khieu Samphan repeated a previous demand for a complete
withdrawal to prepare for a comprehensive solution. Asked if he
thought the talks might be successful, he said ``it would depend on
Vietnam.''
   Vietnam's government radio today quoted Dumas as saying France
is significantly expanding economic relations with Vietnam, largely
isolated for a decade because of its invasion of Cambodia.
   Dumas, who was in Vietnam over the weekend, said in a joint
communique that France will give $8 million to Vietnam, up from
$870,000 last year.

   It was, in President Bush's words, ``a very

   Tuna, Texas, that is _ as performed by actors and quick-change
artists Joe Sears and Jayston Williams, creators of two satirical
plays about life in the third smallest town in Texas.
   Sears and Williams provided the entertainment Sunday night at
Bush's state dinner for the governors. The duo performed four
scenes and six characters, including three from their ``Greater
Tuna'' and ``A Christmas Tuna'' plays and one skit ordered up for
the occasion: a phone-call to the White House from Tuna Tastee
Kreme waitress Helen Bedd.
   The governors and their spouses and Bush and his wife Barbara
laughed riotously at the Tuna reprise in the East Room.
   Sears and Williams, famed for jumping in and out of dresses,
wigs and a myriad of characters, caught the president's fancy Jan.

their 45th wedding anniversary.
   A laughing Bush told the audience afterwards, ``Some of you all

   ``Barbara and I went a while back, had our kids with us, and I
don't think we ever enjoyed an evening more,'' said the president.
   He thanked the pair ``for this very special Tuna evening at the
White House.''
   Afterwards, the actors had one more quick change to perform: out
of their Christmas red-and-green satin Tuna robes and into tuxedos
to join the Bushes and the governors for champagne and music on the
State Floor.

   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
steel-haired symbol of democracy, claimed victory Monday over
President Daniel Ortega and the leftist Sandinista party that has
ruled Nicaragua for 10{ years.
   ``This is the first time the opposition has ever won (in
Nicaragua),'' said Mrs. Chamorro in a speech to supporters.
   At 3 a.m, nine hours after the polls closed, the Supreme
Electoral Council announced that Mrs. Chamorro had 202,417 votes,
or 54 percent, to Ortega's 159,100, or 42.5 percent, with 30.6
percent of precincts reporting.
   ``I am very happy,'' said Mrs. Chamorro as she left her house to
go to campaign headquarters and speak to her supporters.
   ``The people wanted a change,'' she said when asked how she won.
   Asked if she thought a transfer of power would be smooth, she
said, ``That's the commitment. We want peace and reconciliation.''
   Celebrations began breaking out in various neighborhoods of
Managua, with people burning many of the thousands of Sandinista
banners that had been draped across Managua's streets.
   However, the celebrations appeared to die down quickly, and only
a few fires were set.

   Not since George Washington led a surprise
attack on the Hessians in 1776 has there been such a stir over
crossing the Delaware River.
   Pennsylvania and New Jersey are bickering over control of two
toll bridges linking the states.
   The dispute, Pennsylvania officials argue, is about independence
and sovereignty and taxation without representation and other
principles associated with the Revolutionary War.
   Officials with the Burlington County Bridge Commission in New
Jersey say it's all much simpler than that: federal law gives them
jurisdiction over the bridges, the commission needs more money to
repair or replace them and it's fairest to get the money from the
travelers who use them.
   So at the start of the year the commission doubled the tolls, to
50 cents, on the Tacony-Palmyra and Burlington-Bristol bridges
spanning the Delaware River. The commission also moved ahead with
plans to replace the 59-year-old Burlington-Bristol span.
   The moves drew the ire of lawmakers across the river.
   U.S. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said the dispute may not ``dissolve
our union,'' but he warned the commission had better consult
Pennsylvania citizens if it plans on replacing the
Burlington-Bristol Bridge.
   ``We are a nation of many sovereign states,'' Heinz said in a
recent speech on the Senate floor. ``Although we like to think of
ourselves as a perfect union, there are times when the sovereignty
leads to fragmentation, divisiveness and threats upon the very
notion of federalism.''
   The senator also said that raising the tolls amounted to
``taxation without representation.''
   Heinz this month introduced a bill in the Senate that would
require cooperation between both states on any bridge project over
the Delaware River. The Senate has taken no action on it.
   J. Garfield DeMarco, chairman of the bridge commission, did not
return a reporter's telephone calls. But Stephanie Miller, a public
relations consultant for the bridge commission, said Pennsylvanians
have been consulted about the bridges _ and should have nothing to
complain about anyway.
   Even at 50 cents, Miller said the bridges were ``a bargain''
compared with the two other major Delaware River spans, where tolls
are 90 cents.
   Miller said the commission is using the extra money for
desperately needed bridge maintenance.
   She said a new bridge, if finally approved by various state
agencies, would likely be financed by a bond that could be repaid
by another toll increase. But she said that is at least several
years away.
   While it may be unusual for a single-state commission to have
such authority over interstate bridges, Miller said the federal
General Bridge Act of 1946 left little doubt about the commission's
right to replace the Burlington-Bristol span.
   With two lanes and no median strip, the bridge is ``a real pain
for commuters,'' Miller said. ``You drive by a truck and you feel
you're going to get blown over. It's very rickety.''

   Most of the nation enjoyed fair weather early today, but snow
fell in central Montana.
   A winter storm Sunday produced up to 10 inches of snow around
Narragansett, R.I., Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and parts of
northwestern Connecticut.
   Elsewhere Sunday, snow fell over central Missouri, west-central
Minnesota and eastern North Dakota. Scattered snow fell over
northern upper Michigan, northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and
western and central New York.

   The Big Three international observers
dashed around in motorcades through the predawn hours today, racing
from the president to a challenger who suddenly looked like an
upset winner.
   The men one Sandinista adviser once called ``the holy trinity''
were reluctant to comment on the delicate situation.
   ``I really don't want to characterize it at all,'' said former
U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson, head of the 240-member
U.N. observer mission.
   Early returns suggested publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
could score a stunning upset and the question of the hour was how
President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas might take defeat after
more than a decade in power.
   ``You'll have to ask him,'' said former President Jimmy Carter.
   The meeting between Ortega and the umpires he'd invited
anticipating victory ended abruptly, said a witness.
   ``Let's just wait for the rest of the results,'' Ortega said,
turning his back on the distinguished guests.
   Carter, Richardson and Organization of American States Secretary
General Joao Baena Soares then sped off, each in his own
motorcycle-led motorcade, to Mrs. Chamorro's house.
   ``Carter is telling her that she had won,'' one of Mrs.
Chamorro's closest advisers, Emilio Montalban Alvarez, told The
Associated Press.
   Baena Soares also asked Mrs. Chamorro not to claim victory until
all the returns were in, according to a high-ranking source inside
her fragile coalition, the United National Opposition. (Mrs.
Chamorro apparently ignored the request, claiming victory with 30.6
percent of the vote counted.)
   Lights flashing and tires squealing, the three umpires returned
to Election Central.
   Throughout the bitter campaign, opposition vice presidential
candidate Virgilio Godoy had said the Sandinistas would cheat
rather than lose.
   But Baena Soares said the count, one of the most closely
monitored in history, appeared clean so far. ``No problems,'' he
said as he hustled into the counting center. ``No problems.''
   The ballots were being counted twice, once at each polling place
and again at regional election centers. The results were being
telegraphed to the capital and compiled by the Supreme Electoral
Council.
   International observers, more than 3,000 of them, were present
at hundreds of local polling places as the ballots were tallied and
in all nine regional centers. More than 1.75 million people had
registered to vote in the nation's 4,394 polling places and the
turnout appeared high.
   Key observers said the voting had been clean and peaceful.
   Richardson said none of the UN observers had reported any
irregularities in the voting: ``It was essential here to convince
skeptics that the vote could be conducted without fraud.''
   The Sandinistas had been counting on an internationally endorsed
victory to pave the way for improved relations with the United
States. They were not prepared for defeat.
   Nicaragua was the first nation ever to invite the United Nations
to monitor its election. The leftist Sandinista government had also
invited the Organization of American States (OAS), former President
Carter and hundreds of smaller groups.
   Observers from smaller missions also said they were impressed
with how the vote was carried out.
   ``People were very serious about it,'' said Erin Saberi of the
Southwest Voter Registration Project. She and other observers said
they were warmly treated by voters and election officials alike.
   The only observers other than party poll watchers allowed to
watch the actual counting were from the United Nations, the OAS and
the Carter group.
   The U.N. and the OAS, which deployed 430 observers, have been in
Nicaragua since August, monitoring virtually every step of the
electoral process from voter registration to campaign rallies.
While none called the campaign perfect, all agreed a free and fair
election was possible.
   Both teams included everything from political analysts to
statisticians to communications technicians drawn from their staffs
and from member nations.
   Both teams were doing their own partial counts, a statistical
sampling of returns aimed at detecting any fraud. Neither planned
to release the results.
   The Supreme Electoral Council said it had issued credentials for
more than 3,000 international observers from hundreds of groups,
which meant one official watcher for every 550 or so voters _ or
about the same number of observers as Contra rebel fighters
believed to be in the country.
   ``The OAS was everywhere,'' Guatemalan lawmaker Edmond Mullet
said after a day-long tour of the provinces Sunday.
   Mullet was one of 20 observers from the Washington-based Center
for Democracy, which monitored the 1986 elections in the
Philippines and the 1989 elections in Panama for the U.S. Senate.
   Carter played a key role in Panama, denouncing fraud while the
votes were being counted. The discredited election in that country
was part of the Bush administration's explanation for the December
invasion that ousted strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Carter's observer mission is also considered crucial because it
includes a dozen senators and congressmen, many of them members of
key committees such as intelligence and foreign relations.
   Carter, Richardson and OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares
had praised the the anti-fraud safeguards in place for the voting,
many of which were adopted with input from the big observer
missions.

derail the Bush administration's nominee as head of $81 million in
juvenile justice programs.
   ``We vehemently oppose his appointment,'' says Kenneth F.
Melley, the National Education Association's director of
governmental relations.
   The dispute centers on the nomination of Robert Sweet, a Senate
Republican Policy Committee staff aide, to be administrator of the
Justice Department's office of juvenile justice and delinquency
prevention. Conservatives praise his record and say he has become
the victim of an unreasonable attack on the part of liberals.
   The agency funnels millions of dollars in federal grants
designed to assist state and local government's in their fight
against delinquency.
   Senate confirmation is required and that in turn has awakened
memories of infighting between moderate Republicans and ``movement
conservatives'' at the Education Department in the Reagan era.
   Among groups opposed besides the National Education Association
are the American Probation and Parole Association, the Commonwealth
of Virginia Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention and
Advisory Committee, the American Psychological Association and the
National PTA.
   Some complain about his role in political turmoil at the
Education Department seven years ago. All say he lacks experience
specified by law for confirmation as head of the juvenile justice
agency.
   Perhaps the most active critic, however, has been People for the
American Way, the Washington-based liberal group that was prominent
in the successful fight to block Robert Bork's confirmation to the
Supreme Court and skirmishes against an array of other conservative
nominees.
   That alone irks Sweet's chief defender, Sen. Gordon Humphrey,
R-N.H.
   ``I think clearly some of these left-wing groups are trying to
ignite a bonfire, but I don't see that it's having any effect,''
says Humphrey. ``I regarded their activities as an accolade in
Bob's favor.''
   Sweet and his supporters say he received strong commendation for
his work at the department and has experience in the education
field _ if not directly in juvenile justice _ that meets the
requirements of the law.
   Sweet, 52, was involved in a painful episode in 1983 when he was
executive director of the National Council for Educational Research.
   Sweet sought to enlarge his power considerably by asserting
control over the National Institute of Education, the government's
main educational research arm. He based his claim on an
interpretation of the law sharply rejected by Terrel H. Bell, who
was secretary of education at the time.
   In his memoirs, ``The Thirteenth Man,'' Bell said that
Washington observers found Sweet's move ``uproariously funny.''
   ``I should have laughed, too, but I was too angry to do anything
but alternately scream and smolder,'' Bell said. He calls the
affair an effort by ``movement conservatives'' to undermine his
moderate rule at the department.
   Bell said he responded by demanding Sweet's removal. ``The
effort yielded quick results. Sweet was offered a job in the White
House.''
   Sweet nonetheless says he can prove that he was well regarded by
Bell when at the department. ``Secretary Bell actually sent a
personal note to me, which I've kept, complimenting me on how well
I'd run the agency,'' he said.
   ``I really don't want to comment on Secretary Bell, but I got
along with him quite well him my tenure there,'' he added.
   Sweet and Humphrey scoff at the notion that he lacks requisite
juvenile justice experience. He says his background in education
meets the requirements.
   ``Hogwash,'' snorts Melanne Verveer, executive vice president of
People for the American Way. ``He was a biology teacher. That's
hardly a qualification for a job like this.''
   She says more expertise is needed at a time when young people
are confronted by drugs and an array of complex other social
problems.
   Some of the questions may be resolved March 1, when the Senate
Judiciary Committee is set to hold a hearing on Sweet's nomination.
Members of the panel have said little about the matter thus far but
lobbying is in full swing.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who is not a member of the panel,
wrote to Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., more than eight weeks
ago to report that a number of individuals in the juvenile justice
field ``have come to me to express a constellation of concerns
about the merits of this nomination.''

   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia arrived
today for an official two-day visit that was to include talks with
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Radio Moscow said.
   The arrival of Havel coincided with the first day of the
scheduled withdrawal of Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia.
   Havel was accompanied by Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier,
Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Dlougi, Interior Minister Richard
Sacher and Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek, the official Tass news
agency said.
   The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia initialed an agreement on
Feb. 22 calling for the total withdrawal of 73,500 Soviet troops
from Czechoslokia in three stages, with the first stage beginning
Monday.
   Gorbachev and Havel were expected to sign the agreement during
the Czechoslovak president's stay.
   Soviet troops have been in Czechoslovakia since the Red Army-led
Warsaw Pact invasion of 1968 suppressed attempts at political
reform.
   On Friday, Havel returned from a visit to the United States,
where he met with President Bush.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher, Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was slightly higher in moderate trading
late this morning in Europe, helped by weakness in the Japanese yen
and West German mark. Gold prices fell.
   The dollar was benefiting from a drop in the yen as traders
sought refuge in the U.S. currency after the Tokyo stock market
fell sharply early today, dealers said.
   The West German mark, meanwhile, was lower due to concerns about
its possible exchange rate with the East German mark under German
unification, dealers said.
   But traders said the dollar's outlook still was bearish.
   ``While the dollar has clearly taken the high road, it has lost
some momentum,'' one Milan trader said.
   He added that ``the fundamentals of the U.S. economy aren't all
that rosy.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 2.18 yen to a closing 148.65 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 148.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _ 1.6874 West German marks, up from 1.6779
   _ 1.4825 Swiss francs, up from 1.4770
   _ 5.7115 French francs, up from 5.6715
   _ 1.8980 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8890
   _ 1,246.50 Italian lire, up from 1,240.75
   _ 1.1982 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6973, compared with $1.7090 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.00 a troy ounce,
down from 416.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $412.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $412.75, down from $415.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.47 to close at a bid $412.15.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.23 a troy ounce from
Friday's $5.27.

<HEAD>Astronaut's Widow Criticizes TV Docudrama `Challenger'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The widow of an astronaut killed in the 1986
explosion of space shuttle Challenger lambasted the television
docudrama ``Challenger,'' saying it devastated her children.
   ``How many kinds of death must Ellison Onizuka die? How many
deaths of him do my children have to overcome?'' Lorna Onizuka told
ABC affiliate KITV in an interview broadcast Sunday night, the
night ABC aired the docudrama.
   ``My youngest daughter said, `First they killed him and now
they're killing what I thought he was like.' She said, `How many
times are they going to kill him?''' Mrs. Onizuka said in the
telephone interview from her home near Houston.
   ``This production makes a mockery of my husband's life, the man
he truly was and the ultimate sacrifice he made for a country he
believed in,'' Mrs. Onizuka said.
   Ellison Onizuka of Hawaii and six other crew members died in the
explosion shortly after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla., on Jan.
28, 1986.
   Onizuka's brother, Claude, also objected to the movie.
   ``I think it made him seem like he was an arrogant person, which
he wasn't,'' Claude Onizuka said. ``I think he was very humble. He
remembered his roots and how he got there.''
   Claude Onizuka was particularly upset with one scene that
depicted the astronaut saying at a news conference that he would
not mind a malfunction in space so he could put his emergency
training to use.
   ``He would have never said something like that,'' Claude Onizuka
said.
   George Englund Sr., the movie's executive producer and writer,
defended the scene, telling KITV it was taken verbatim from a news
conference.
   The docudrama also has been criticized by Grace Corrigan, the
mother of Christa McAuliffe, the New Hampshire schoolteacher killed
in the Challenger disaster.
   ``It started to upset me, then I said, `No, I'm not going to let
it because it is only a video,'' she said last week.
   Englund said he knew there would be mixed reactions to the film,
but defended it as ``sensitive in almost every aspect.''

   Smokers puffed away in airport terminals as they tried to figure
out how to cope with a new ban on smoking on virtually all domestic
airline flights. Non-smokers breathed a bit easier.
   Dave Noeth, a traveler at La Guardia Airport in New York City,
said under certain circumstances he was prepared to violate the ban
that took effect Sunday.
   ``If the plane starts to go down, I'm lighting one up,'' he said.
   USAir flight attendant Kelly Brown in Atlanta said a colleague
told her ``she had one man nearly miss his plane because he was
just standing by the gate trying to finish his cigarette.''
   In Seattle, Leo Haag complained that the new law is not fair.
   ``It doesn't bother me, two or three hours flying without a
cigarette, but I don't think it's treating everybody equally,'' he
said, puffing on a cigarette in an airport terminal.
   But non-smoking travelers said air quality on Sunday's flights
had improved, and they were relieved not to breathe the smoke or
have it foul their clothes.
   ``It's great,'' said Ron Upham in Newark. He said he and his
wife used to try to get seats far away from the smoking section,
but sometimes smelled smokers' air anyway.
   ``I feel like they're inflicting something on me,'' Upham said.
   The federal ban, in force since 1988 on flights of less than two
hours, now applies to 99.8 percent of domestic flights. Only
flights to Alaska and Hawaii of more than six hours are excepted.
Overseas fights are not affected.
   Under the new law, smoking is allowed on only 28 of the nation's
regularly scheduled 17,000 flights every day, said Jeff Boyer of
the Coalition on Smoking or Health in Seattle.
   Passengers were told not to try smoking in airplane bathrooms.
Tampering with smoke detectors in the plane's restrooms is a
federal offense punishable with a $2,000 fine.
   Some smokers didn't resent the ban.
   ``It's probably going to add more years to my life,'' said David
R. Merkel as he waited for a flight at Raleigh-Durham (N.C.)
International Airport. ``But given my druthers, I'd rather have a
cigarette.''
   Other smokers were unequivocal.
   `I'm going to go nuts,'' said Joseph Golad of Chicago, resigning
himself to a smokeless 2{-hour flight to Dallas from O'Hare
International Airport.
   To help passengers like Golad, the Chicago Lung Association
distributed ``Smoker Survival Kits,'' which contained sugarless
chewing gum, breath mints and tips on how to cope.
   The association recommended passengers doodle to keep hands
busy, stay away from the common cigarette companions of coffee and
alcohol, and take a walk around the plane or go to sleep.
   In Seattle, the Coalition on Smoking or Health offered their own
tips, and gave away candy and pins that read: ``I'm kissable, I
don't smoke.''
   A co-author of the ban, Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New
Jersey, a former 20-year smoker, said the measure was the most
popular he had ever worked on.
   ``It's the most positive thing in terms of response that I've
ever done,'' he said.
   Lautenberg and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said they hope the
law will be extended soon to airport terminals and train travel.
   Lautenberg was mugging for cameras in Newark, N.J., as Joan
Dahmer arrived on a bumpy flight from Dallas.
   ``I don't think it's right that we can't have a cigarette to
calm us down,'' Dahmer complained.
   But in Denver, Frank Mills, an addictions therapist, took the
occasion to puff on what he said he hoped would be the last
cigarette of an 18-year habit.
   ``I think it's great,'' Mills said. ``I'm ready to quit.''

<TEXT>
   Riot police fired tear gas and a
stun grenade today at student protesters who were demanding the
release of detained friends and talks with President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny about social injustices.
   Police also attacked peaceful protesters at the main campus and
outside a suburban university residence, and beat up students and
school pupils who blockaded a marketplace, witnesses said.
   Police appeared to be reacting with increasing violence as
student protests entered their eighth day, defying a Sunday night
appeal by Houphouet-Boigny for an end to the unrest.
   This usually peaceful West African nation is being undermined by
growing discontent over austerity measures imposed to counter a
10-year-old recession.
   ``Free our comrades!'' a group of about 200 students yelled as
they ran through the central Boulevard de la Republique, before
fleeing riot police who fired tear gas and a stun grenade.
   They told reporters they want direct talks with
Houphouet-Boigny, the 84-year-old president who has ruled the Ivory
Coast as a one-party state since its independence from France in
1960. Militant students are demanding he step down and give way to
a multiparty democracy.
   In Yopougon, a working class suburb where the unrest began Feb.
19, witnesses said police fired tear gas and stun grenades at a
small group of students who refused to get on to two buses police
said would take them from their dormitories to the main campus in
Cocody suburb, three miles away.
   At the campus, students said riot police wielding truncheons set
upon peaceful protesters and spectators who got in the way. A
reporter at the scene said he watched three policemen repeatedly
beat a student who stumbled and fell in the stampede to get away
from the attackers.
   A taxi driver said he watched police beat students and school
pupils who set up a blockade in the marketplace of Adjame, a
residential suburb for working class and middle class Ivorians.
   The students and pupils fled, he said.
   Militant students tried to congregate in the city center to
protest outside the presidential offices, where Houphouet-Boigny
was meeting with representatives of businesses, trade unions and
professional organizations.
   Sources said he is trying to win their support for additional
austerity measures expected to be announced at a bigger meeting to
include legislators on Tuesday.
   Employees at government-owned companies had their salaries cut
30 percent this month, and the students want Cabinet ministers' pay
also reduced by that amount.
   Other civil servants have had their salary levels frozen for
eight years.

<HEAD>Widow Of Newspaper Publisher Leads Opposition To Victory</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix paragraph spacing</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher
of the nation's opposition newspaper, led a 14-party coalition to
victory over Sandinista rule despite political inexperience and a
broken knee.
   ``The Nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in
democracy, in peace and in freedom,'' Mrs. Chamorro told more than
1,000 cheering supporters at her election headquarters today.
   ``I am very happy,'' she said. ``The people wanted a change.''
   As a girl, Violeta Barrios wanted to learn to type and be a
secretary when she grew up.
   Instead, she married a man who became one of Nicaragua's
revolutionary heroes and was assassinated in 1978. As a gray-haired
widow of 60, Mrs. Chamorro found herself the political symbol at
the center of an electoral storm.
   Mrs. Chamorro ran for president with gusto and a common touch.
   Dona Violeta, as she is called even by President Daniel Ortega,
said in in an earlier interview, ``I am nothing.''
   ``But in this life, you can learn anything,'' she added.
   An elegant woman with graceful manners, Mrs. Chamorro's two main
strengths are her martyred husband and her lack of alignment with
any one political party.
   That was enough to qualify her as a candidate for the disparate
and fractious United National Opposition, a coalition of 14 parties
known as UNO.
   The memory of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro has been used by all sides,
even by Mrs. Chamorro's four children, two of whom support Ortega.
   ``My father's enemies are within UNO,'' wrote Mrs. Chamorro's
eldest daughter, Claudia. The phrase was used in Sandinista
campaign graffiti throughout Nicaragua.
   Mrs. Chamorro's late husband, whose father started what is today
   Nicaragua's sole opposition newspaper, La Prensa, was shot down
by assassins in January 1978.
   The slaying, believed to have been ordered by dictator Anastasio
Somoza, ignited the popular revolt that brought the Sandinistas to
power in July 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who still publishes La Prensa, became a member of
the junta that took over from Somoza but quit after nine months.
   She has bitter memories of what she considers the Sandinistas'
betrayal of her husband's democratic goals and her own faith in the
revolution.
   ``I'm not praising Somoza's government; it was horrible, but the
threats that I've had from the Sandinistas _ I never thought they
would repay me in that way,'' she said.
   Her pain as a widow, strong religous convictions and loyalty to
Chamorro's memory _ she pays weekly visits to his grave to leave
fresh flowers _ made her a symbol of dissatisfaction with the
Sandinistas. But there have been many drawbacks.
   Even after months of campaigning, she stumbled over speeches and
made baffling blunders. Last year, during a trip to Europe, she was
asked about UNO's government program.
   ``It's a secret,'' she replied.
   The Sandinistas have tried to paint Mrs. Chamorro as
empty-headed. A pro-government newspaper runs a daily column where
nearly every joke portrays her as slow-witted.
   Perhaps responding to this, Mrs. Chamorro told a rally early in
the campaign, ``I am not a dummy.''
   One of her top advisers is her eldest son, Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro, who returned from exile in Miami, where he had been a
director of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels who tried to topple
Ortega's government by force.
   The son feared his mother would be manipulated by vice
presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy and top aide Alfredo Cesar,
two strong-willed politicians.
   Mrs.Chamorro, the eldest daughter of a landowning family, was
sent to U.S. finishing schools to learn English.
   With her father's death in 1948, she returned to the family home
in the southern town of Rivas and married Chamorro.
   Her political awakening came after years of being a housewife
and mother.
   On one of the various occasions Chamorro was imprisoned by
Somoza, Mrs. Chamorro blew up at being kept in the dark.
   ``There had been something political and they threw him in
jail,'' Mrs. Chamorro said. ``I asked Pedro what was going on. Then
I told him, `Look, let's make a deal. From today on, you're going
to tell me all that's happening, so I won't be caught unaware.' ''
   She has played the role of presidential candidate with gusto.
   She broke her right knee in a fall Dec. 31. and was hampered
during the campaign by a cast. She campaigned from a wheelchair
under a sun tent set up in the back of a pickup truck.
   Beaming smiles at peasants, Dona Violeta was familiar and
neighborly, calling people ``papito'' and ``mamita.''
   ``I try to help, to do good things for the country,'' Mrs.
Chamorro said. ``I am what I am.''

   A day after voters in Lithuania apparently voted
the Communists out of power, Moldavia's restive citizenry cast
ballots in their first free elections under Soviet rule.
   Like the Lithuanians to the north, many ethnic Moldavians are
seeking sovereignty and hoped Sunday's balloting would bring
victory to pro-independence forces.
   The weekend elections came amid nationwide pro-democracy rallies
that demanded a swift end to the Communist Party's monopoly on
power.
   In Sunday's vote in Moldavia, a republic bordering Romania, the
pro-autonomy Moldavian Popular Front hoped to win at least half of
the 380 seats in Parliament from the Communists.
   ``We think part of the other deputies will come around to our
side,'' said Yuri Roshka, a Popular Front leader and candidate.
   One Popular Front voter, 26-year-old Anatoly Zhdanov, said after
voting: ``We are learning democracy and we want to use the
Parliament as a peaceful way to gain our sovereignty.''
   Others in a park in Kishinev, the republic's capital, agreed.
   ``We want to be an independent republic _ not with the Russians,
and not with the Romanians. And above all we want our
sovereignty,'' said Anatoly Goncharov, listening to results of the
Lithuanian election on a radio.
   The head of Lithuania's Sajudis Popular Front said Sunday that
independence from Moscow might be attainable within months. On
Saturday, the republic's voters appeared to choose the country's
first legislature not dominated by Communists.
   Unofficial returns showed that of the 90 races decided,
candidates endorsed by Sajudis took 72 seats and non-Sajudis
candidates took 18, said Rita Dapkus, head of the Sajudis
information agency. There are 141 seats, and the rest were to be
decided in runoffs March 10.
   ``If that is not a landslide, then what is?'' Algimantas
Cekuolis, a Sajudis officer, told a news conference Sunday in the
republic's capital, Vilnius. ``It is a very clear indication of
what the people of Lithuania think.''
   Sajudis gathered the election results by calling local election
commissions, and the tallies were believed to be reliable. Official
results in Lithuania were expected today, as were unofficial
returns from Moldavia.
   Turnout among the 2.56 million eligible Lithuanians was about 75
percent, officials said.
   ``We have a common and very clear goal. Our clear goal is
statehood and the independence of Lithuania,'' said Vytautus
Landsbergis, Sajudis chairman. ``This goal is achievable this
year.''
   Sajudis wants talks with Moscow to prepare for an orderly
secession, which would break a 50-year-old tie that began with
Lithuania's occupation by the Red Army in 1940 and its forcible
annexation later that year.
   The movement supports a neutral, sovereign Lithuania
characterized by a market economy and guarantees for human and
cultural rights.
   The Soviet Communist Party recently pledged to support
legislation establishing a procedure by which republics could
legally secede from the union.
   Although Sajudis dominated Saturday's voting, Landsbergis did
not rule out a strong role for reformed Communists in a coalition
government selected by the new Parliament. He stressed the close
ties between Sajudis and reform-minded Communist Party members.
   Reform Communists won 22 seats on Saturday, 13 in districts
where they were backed by Sajudis. The Communist winners included
the party's first secretary, Algirdas Brazauskas, who in December
defied Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev and led his party to
split with Moscow.
   While Lithuania enjoyed two decades of independence between the
world wars, Moldavia, a republic of 4 million people in the
southwest corner of the Soviet Union, has not known independence
this century.
   Until the czarist empire fell apart in 1917, Moldavia was the
Russian province of Bessarabia. After World War I it was ceded to
Romania, with which it shares a nearly identical language and many
historical and cultural heroes.
   Moldavia's common heritage with Romania was suppressed when
Stalin annexed it to the Soviet Union in 1940. But a half-century
of Soviet domination failed to diminish the desire of many of the
estimated 3 million ethnic Moldavians to reunite with their
neighbor.
   Demands for unity surged in Moldavia when Romania's December
revolution toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   But the Popular Front says reunification should be put on hold
for the moment in favor of rebuilding the republic's economy and
restoring Moldavian culture, stunted by decades of Russification.
   The Popular Front said it would press for the right to engage in
direct economic relations with other countries, a multiparty
political system, private property and a market economy.
   Parliamentary elections were also held Sunday in the Central
Asian republic of Tadzhikistan, recently rocked by ethnic unrest in
which at least 22 people died.
   Reports from the capital of Dushanbe, monitored in London, said
voting was orderly. Official radio put the voter turnout at 64
percent and attributed the low turnout to the 6 p.m. curfew that
has been in effect since Feb. 12 to prevent more unrest.
   A parliamentary vote also took place Sunday in neighboring
Kirghizia, a mountainous republic on the border with China.
   The official Tass news agency said official results in both
elections were expected to be announced Thursday.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Checking Whether Underaged Immigrant Was Right
Defendant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As prosecutors try to prove an inmate was not
wrongly tried as an adult in an armed robbery, a published report
raised questions about whether he even committed the crime.
   Luan Van Hoang was 13 but claimed to be 17 and gave a fictitious
name when he was charged in 1986, documents show. The Vietnamese
refugee was convicted and sentenced to 38 years and since has been
in a maximum-security prison.
   Last week, District Judge Jack Hampton ordered Hoang returned to
Dallas for a hearing to determine his actual age. He is believed to
be 17.
   Luan's age, however, no longer remains the only question about
his conviction, The Dallas Morning News reported Sunday. A
transcript of testimony in his trial raises the issue of whether
officials prosecuted the right person, the paper said.
   Luan said he told authorities his name was Michael Nguyen and
that he was 17 to avoid being returned to a youth detention center
in California where he had spent eight months of a nine-month term
for joyriding and auto theft.
   The boy said he believed Vietnamese friends who told him that
lying about his age would result in probation. Dallas County
authorities accepted Luan's story and tried him as an adult.
   In 1986, police portrayed Luan as the ``ringleader'' of a youth
gang that committed a series of armed robberies in Dallas County.
Luan was identified during his trial as a gun-wielding robber.
   But Luan, who did not testify in his trial and appeared with an
interpreter, said he waited outside the home of a Vietnamese couple
in Carrollton, a Dallas suburb, while they were robbed by four of
his companions. He said he did not enter the home, use a gun or
receive any of the proceeds from the robbery.
   Testimony in Luan's trial reveals several inconsistencies.
   Luan, abandoned by his companions after the robbery, was
arrested less than an hour later at a car wash, where police found
a broken watch worth $50 and a costume jewelry pin worth $5, taken
during the robbery. A $1,500 gold chain and $2,000 in cash were
among other items stolen in the robbery.
   Not explained in the trial, the Morning News said, is why the
alleged gun-toting gang leader would be stranded by his
subordinates and left with the least valuable items taken in the
heist.
   Testimony showed that police were unable to find Luan's
fingerprints at the robbery site. The state's case against Luan
hinged on the testimony of a victim who, according to the police
report, was blindfolded during much of the robbery, the newspaper
reported.
   Prosecutors, however, have requested information from California
authorities that they hope will challenge the growing number of
records _ some of them sworn statements _ that show Luan would have
been 13 at the time of his trial.
   Luan was returned to Dallas from the Texas Department of
Corrections last week after the newspaper reported that immigration
and school records show he was born Oct. 10, 1972.
   The newspaper since has obtained two sworn court documents from
California prosecutors and one from another immigrant who escaped
with Luan from Vietnam in 1980, showing that Luan would have been
13 at the time of his conviction in Dallas.

<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces skirmished in east
Beirut today while a mediation committee said it was determined to
maintain its effort to stabilize a cease-fire despite persistent
violations.
   Police said two people were killed and six wounded by sniper
fire in various districts of embattled east Beirut controlled by
Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia and renegade Gen. Michel
Aoun's troops.
   By police count, the showdown for dominance of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave has killed 693 people and wounded
1,921 since it broke out Jan. 30.
   Father Boulos Naaman, a member of the three-man Christian
mediation committee, said in an interview on Geagea's Lebanese
Broadcasting Corp. television that his panel ``will not get fed up,
despite the difficulties we are facing.''
   The two sides began observing a cease-fire Feb. 17 after
fighting each other to a standstill. However, they have been
reinforcing their forces in east Beirut and other districts of the
Christian enclave in apparent preparation for more clashes.
   The mediation committee, which called the cease-fire, has been
trying for three days to reopen roads linking areas controlled by
the 6,000-member militia and Aoun's 19,000-strong army, in an
effort to buttress the truce and ease the plight of the population.
   But a three-hour shelling duel Sunday prevented the committee
from reopening a major road junction in east Beirut.
   In a related development, the leftist newspaper As-Safir said an
unnamed representative of Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi met
Geagea in east Beirut and obtained from him a ``written pledge to
accept bringing east Beirut under government control'' if Hrawi's
government intervened to stop the intra-Christian showdown.
   The report could not be immediately verified with the Lebanese
Forces command.
   Hrawi was elected Nov. 24 in line with an Arab-brokered peace
accord to end Lebanon's nearly 15 years of civil war. Aoun has
rejected Hrawi's election along with the peace plan which was
worked out by Lebanese legislators at the Saudi town of Taif last
October.
   He objects to the pact because it does not provide an explicit
timetable for a full withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops from
Lebanon. They have been in the country since 1976 under an Arab
League peace-keeping mandate.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronite Catholics, the Christian
sect that has dominated political institutions in Lebanon since
independence from France in 1943.
   Also today, two leading newspapers published letters addressed
to American journalist Terry Anderson from his sister expressing
hope that he and the other foreign hostages held in Lebanon will be
released soon.
   ``You are all sent strength and love and hope. Do not despair
for some day _soon, please God _ we will all be reunited,'' Peggy
Say said in her letter to her brother and all other hostages held
in Lebanon.
   An Arabic translation of the letter was published on the front
page of the independent An-Nahar and on an inside page in the
leftist As-Safir.
   A second message was signed by Bill Foley, a friend of
Anderson's, in the name of the Journalists Committee to Free Terry
Anderson.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Moslem west Beirut. He is
the longest held of the 18 Western captives in Lebanon.

   Dozens of Palestinian youths stoned soldiers
trying to impose a curfew today in the occupied Gaza Strip and the
army responded with tear gas and gunfire, shooting and wounding 22
people, Arab reports said.
   Army helicopters dropped tear gas into the southern town of
Rafah after the clash erupted outside the home of a Palestinian
youth who died a day earlier after a confrontation with soldiers,
Palestinian witnesses said.
   U.N. relief officials said 38 other people suffered minor
injuries from rubber bullets and 100 people were treated for tear
gas inhalation at a local clinic near the site of the riots in
Brazil refugee camp in Rafah.
   The army confirmed there were clashes in Rafah and that eight
people were hospitalized for gunshot wounds. Rafah also was
declared a closed military zone, the army said, effectively barring
entry and exit to the area's 50,000 residents.
   Soldiers also destroyed the homes of three Palestinians accused
of killing an alleged collaborator, the army said. It said a fourth
home was sealed because one of its residents was suspected of fire
bomb attacks.
   The military, meanwhile, planned to begin a phased reopening of
colleges and universities that have been shut throughout the
26-month rebellion against Israeli occupation, the Jerusalem Post
daily reported.
   Army officials refused to comment on the report, which said 16
vocational schools would be opened in the first stage. But the
military announced plans for a news conference later today on the
subject.
   In Israel, tens of thousands of Israeli Arabs staged a general
strike to protest inadequate funding for municipal governments in
Arab areas and the central government's failure to make good on a
promise to write off $50 million in debts.
   The violence in Gaza came the morning after Vahel Jamil El Hams,
20, died at Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv of wounds sustained
in a clash with soldiers in the Brazil camp.
   El Hams' death raised to 659 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis since the start of the uprising in December 1987. An
additional 189 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators, and 43 Israelis also have been killed.
   Dozens gathered outside El Hams' home and threw stones as troops
who arrived at the scene in 23 jeeps tried to impose a curfew, Arab
witnesses said. Soldiers reportedly responded by opening fire and
were joined by troops who shot tear-gas from helicopters.
   At least 22 people wounded with bullets were treated at Nasser
Hospital in nearby Khan Yunis, among them two 12-year-old boys,
hospital reports said.

<HEAD>Pittsburgh Ponders Taxing College Research Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city proposal to tax research grants has
angered college officials, who say it would be unprecedented and
could undermine the region's economic development.
   ``I've never heard such a thing in Pittsburgh, the state or the
country,'' said Louis Popper, chief general counsel at the
University of Pittsburgh. ``Frankly, I'd be surprised if anybody
ever has.''
   Under the city's proposal, research grants would be subject to a
six mill business privilege tax. A mill is a tenth of a cent.
   If such a tax had been in effect last year, it would have
generated as much as $1.6 million.
   The city's finance director, Ben Hayllar, said there are no
immediate plans to impose such a tax. But, he said, ``We've talked
about it and will look at it.''
   That's enough to worry officials at both Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon University, which both receive millions in research grants,
especially in medicine and computer science.
   ``We are legally tax exempt and I would vigorously oppose any
effort to cheat on that,'' said Carnegie Mellon University
President Richard M. Cyert. ``This kind of research is the key to
economic development, not only here but nationally.''
   The idea is taking a back seat to an effort to remove
university-owned buildings from the city's list of tax-exempt real
estate. But the taxing of grants could come up for serious
discussion later in the year, officials said.
   Pitt received about $143 million in grants in fiscal 1989, $113
million from federal, state or local governments. If all that were
subject to tax, the college would owe $859,200. If only the private
contributions were taxed, the amount would be $111,600.
   Carnegie Mellon received a total of nearly $121 million in
research grants during the same period, including $19 million in
private contributions. Its tax would be $724,200 on everything;
$113,400 on private contributions alone.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Carlsson Returned To Office In Parliament Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament confirmed Ingvar Carlsson as
prime minister of a new Social Democratic government today, 12 days
after he resigned when his economic austerity policy was defeated.
   The vote of 175-101, with 59 abstentions, came after Carlsson
revamped his proposals to rescue Sweden from inflation climbing
toward 9 percent, amid stagnant growth. Fourteen legislators were
absent from the 349-member Riksdag.
   The new Cabinet will be presented and installed on Tuesday.
   The vote ended the worst political crisis for the Social
Democrats since they returned to power in 1982 after a six-year
hiatus, the only time they had sat in opposition since 1932.
   Carlsson's Cabinet resigned Feb. 14 when the legislature
rejected his emergency economic program. He was asked to form a new
government Thursday after the centrist opposition parties failed to
unite on a common policy.
   The Social Democrats, who control 156 seats, won support from
the 21-member Communist Party when Carlsson dropped a proposal to
impose a two-year freeze on wages and prices and to ban strikes.
   The new 17-point package would bnring in foreign workers from
the Soviet Baltic states to alleviate an inflation-boosting labor
shortage, and increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco.
   Two center-right opposition parties condemned what they called
Carlsson's sham resignation and said they favored immediate
elections, 18 months ahead of schedule.
   ``The government crisis looks like a piece of absurd theater, in
which many have been forced to play along,'' said Bengt Westerberg,
leader of the Liberal Party.
   Carl Bildt, head of the conservative Moderate Party said, ``We
say `no' to the prime minister being allowed to return as if
nothing had happened.''
   The opposition was given a chance last week to assemble a ruling
coalition. But the three non-socialist parties failed to patch
differences on economic and energy policy or overcome the socialist
majority held by the Social Democrats and Communists.

<HEAD>East Chilled By Coldest Weather of Year; 19 Dead in Accidents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The coldest weather since December slid further down the East
Coast today after a snowy weekend in which at least 19 people died
in weather-related accidents in five states.
   ``This will be the coldest weather of 1990,'' said Mel
Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at Western Connecticut
State University in Danbury. ``We didn't get January in January, so
we're getting it in late February.''
   The balmy breezes that brought a hint of spring to the Northeast
last week were quickly replaced by below-zero wind chills and
blowing snow.
   Records were set this morning in Newark, N.J., where the
temperature at the airport was 8 degrees; in Pomona, N.J., where it
was 9 degrees; in Windsor Locks, Conn., where it was 3 below zero;
and in Syracuse, N.Y., where it was minus 8.
   At 5 a.m., it was 20 below zero at Saranac Lake in New York's
Adirondacks.
   Walter Zamorski, a National Weather Service meteorologist in
Newark, said the weather front was known as the ``Alberta Low,''
after the Canadian province that's getting blamed for launching it
southward.
   Up to a foot of snow fell over a wide area on Saturday and
Sunday, causing numerous traffic pileups.
   The worst of the crashes occurred Saturday evening in western
Ohio on Interstate 75 near Tipp City, where 30 cars and two
tractor-trailer rigs were involved in a fiery chain-reaction crash
in which nine people died and 55 were injured.
   Still larger pileups north of the Tipp City crash effectively
closed I-75. Three separate crashes within three miles of Findlay
involved a total of 99 cars. The highway reopened Sunday.
   ``In my 18 years, this is by far the worst I've ever seen,''
patrol Lt. Dan Dickerson said of the Tipp City pileup. Leaking gas
tanks caused a fire that spread through the wreckage, hampering
rescue efforts.
   In all, 13 people died in weather-related accidents in Ohio.
Another three died in Illinois, and one each in Michigan, Indiana
and Kentucky.
   The snow caused a 30-car fender-bender Sunday on Interstate 91
near Holyoke, Mass., but state police reported only minor damage
and no injuries.
   Blowing snow was blamed for a massive chain-reaction pileup on
Interstate 87 near Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Fifteen people suffered
minor injuries. A person at the scene said a whiteout from the
blowing snow blinded several drivers, who began sliding sideways
and banging into each other.
   As far south as North Carolina, winds reached up to 50 mph,
blowing trees and limbs onto utility lines and causing at least
3,500 people to lose power over the weekend, authorities said.
   In Georgia, farmers fretted about what a freeze would do to
their peaches. At 9 a.m. today, it was 31 degrees in Atlanta.
   ``Depending upon how cold it gets, the peach crop could be wiped
out,'' state Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said Sunday.
``You could also have damage to the apple trees, the ornamentals on
certain trees and the wheat crop.''
   Al Pearson, chairman of the Georgia Agriculture Commodity
Commission for Peaches, said it would be at least Wednesday before
officials could assess the damage.

   Two leading newspapers today published
letters addressed to American journalist Terry Anderson from his

   ``Countless people around the word remember all of you and work
to end your suffering,'' the message said.
   Anderson, 42, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Moslem west Beirut. He is
the longest held of the 18 Western captives in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say is on a tour with an Associated Press delegation to
seek the release of Anderson and the others. She has met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope John Paul II and
Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   ``Pope Paul gave me a rosary for you, to replace the one you
have made in captivity,'' Mrs. Say said.
   The papers published their own Arabic translation of the
letters. The English text was not published, casting doubt on
whether Anderson and other hostages will be able to understand what
was addressed to them.
   Anderson and the 17 other captives did not know Arabic at the
time they were kidnapped.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremist factions. They are eight Americans, four Britons,
two Swiss, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.

<HEAD>East Germany Accepts Applications for Unemployment Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany today began accepting
applications for unemployment benefits for the first time in the
Communist nation's 40-year history.
   Also today, an opposition party leveled new accusations of fraud
against the Communist leadership.
   Unofficial estimates contend that 70,000 East Germans are
unemployed, but Labor Ministry spokesman Joachim Guenter said the
number of applicants was far lower than had been expected.
Authorities speculated about 4,000 people would seek the new
insurance.
   While the number of unemployed is relatively low among East
Germany's 9 million workers, the figure is expected to shoot up to
as much as 15 percent after competitive Western practices are
introduced.
   West Germany has offered an economic bailout of East Germany in
return for a wholesale conversion to capitalism and eventual unity.
   In the latest accusations against the embattled Communists, a
little-known political group, the Independent People's Party, filed
a complaint in the nation's high court alleging Communist Party
leader Gregor Gysi manipulated financial records for 1989, East
Germany's ADN news agency reported.
   The Communists previously controlled most of the nation's
wealth, and numerous accusations have been made against the former
party leadership for allegedly skimming funds for personal use or
misstating the party's wealth to avoid having to turn over assets.
   Gysi took over the party leadership in December and declared it
a reformed organization free of corruption.
   The complaint seeks to have Gysi jailed pending investigation.
No immediate action was taken by judicial authorities on the
People's Party appeal.
   There also was no immediate reaction from the Communist Party.
   On Sunday, East German Premier Hans Modrow gave the Communists a
last chance for political survival by agreeing to lead his party in
March 18 elections. The reformist premier made the announcement at
a political rally.
   Although Modrow remains the most popular politician in East
Germany, the Communists are expected to poorly in the balloting
because their forerunners are blamed for leading the nation to the
brink of collapse.
   Modrow's decision to stand by the party could draw enough voter
support for a parliamentary presence.

<TEXT>
   The Texas primary isn't until March 13, but
balloting has begun under the state's new ``no excuse'' absentee
voting system, which politicians say has made big changes in the
way they campaign.
   This is the first governor's race under the 1987 extended voting
law, which lets Texans cast ballots during a period that began
Wednesday and ends March 9.
   Before 1987, absentee voting was allowed for about 10 days, and
voters needed a valid excuse to cast an absentee ballot _ a trip
out of their home county, for instance. Now, voters just have to
show up at select polling places, such as county courthouses, and
cast their ballots.
   In the 1988 presidential primaries, ballots cast before election
day more than doubled compared with the 1984 primary, results
showed.
   George Bayoud, Texas secretary of state, said the new law gives
voters no excuse not to vote in the primary.
   ``Those old excuses about being turned off by having to stand in
long lines or having to take off work on a weekday are no longer
valid,'' he said.
   Bayoud planned to vote absentee and make several public
appearances to tout the new law.
   His spokesman Mark Toohey said, ``This will be a bellwether.
This will be a good test to see how many people this attracts to
the polls.''
   The relaxed requirements pose new challenges for candidates,
said Diane Sheridan, president of the League of Women Voters.
   ``The extended absentee voting creates a need for extended
information,'' Ms. Sheridan said.
   Ed Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party,
agreed, saying candidates must have television ads going and
mailouts arriving each day of the absentee voting period or they
stand to lose a certain number of voters.
   Most of the gubernatorial candidates have developed strategies
aimed at absentee voters. Republican rancher and oil man Clayton
Williams notified 100,000 potential supporters of absentee voting
locations and times.
   ``It will be too little too late,'' for candidates who don't
have successful absentee voting programs, said Williams' state
co-chairman, Roy Barrera Jr.
   The new law means more campaign spending in a state with 17
million people and 21 television markets. The seven major GOP and
Democratic candidates already have spent $20 million, and analysts
say the final tab could reach $50 million.
   ``It forces the candidates to stretch out their media dollars
and not just concentrate at the end of the campaign,'' said
political consultant George Christian of Austin.
   Christian said probably 40 percent of the primary voters will
cast absentee ballots. There are approximately 8.2 million voters
registered for the primary election.
   Democratic and Republican party officials say they will lead
absentee voting drives during the November general election
campaign, but are letting the candidates handle the effort for the
primaries.
   Although absentee voting was not reported separately until last
year, election officials have tracked absentee voting patterns in
major cities and believe the extended, no-excuse law has boosted
voter turnout in other races.
   For example, in San Antonio, 8,218 walk-in absentee ballots were
cast in the 1984 presidential primary. After the new law was
implemented, 41,262 people voted absentee in the 1988 presidential
primary.
   In Houston, absentee votes increased from 4,683 in the 1984
presidential primary to 7,082 in 1988. Absentee voting also jumped
in Dallas, from 1,492 to 9,571 in the two presidential primaries,
and in Fort Worth, from 3,099 to 8,822.
   But Christian said there is no proof the law has increased
overall turnout, just that a larger portion of the voters have cast
early ballots.

<TEXT>
   A Colombian-American group organized a 1,000-car
caravan that rolled through John F. Kennedy International Airport
to protest the circumstances surrounding the crash of Avianca
Flight 52.
   The group, Colombianos Unidos de America, called Sunday for the
release of all the facts about the flight, which apparently ran out
of fuel before crashing on New York's Long Island, killing 73
people.
   Demonstrators charged that air traffic controllers had displayed
bias against the flight because it was Colombian, making it circle
the airport when it was low on fuel.
   ``There's obvious discrimination against all flights from
Colombia,'' Fernando Oliver, who said he was a lawyer for survivors
of two crash victims, told The New York Times. He added that the
plane had not been allowed to land at another airport because
drug-sniffing dogs were already in place at Kennedy.
   ``That's not the case at all,'' said Kathleen Bergen, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration. ``The plane
made an approach to Kennedy and missed. And it was coming around to
make a second approach. I think that speaks for itself.''
   Sgt. Pete Berry, a police spokesman, said the protest caravan
started at Shea Stadium at about 11:30 a.m. and proceeded to the
airport, which is about five miles away. Berry said the caravan was
orderly and created no traffic problems.
   The first 73 cars displayed the names of the crash victims.
Others carried placards and cards criticizing the air controllers.
   Flight 52 crashed Jan. 25 in Cove Neck, an affluent suburb on
Long Island Sound. The crash is under investigation by the National
Transportation Safety Board.

   A month after celebrating the 10th
anniversary of their arrival from Vietnam, a couple were killed
along with a niece and nephew when a truck hit their car broadside
at a busy intersection.
   Huy Huu Tran, 37, and his wife, Linh Tri-Cam Doan, 35, of
Stillwater, held a lavish dinner last month to celebrate their
success and thank friends and employers for helping make their
American dream come true. Killed with them Sunday were a niece and
nephew whose parents remain in Vietnam.
   The Rev. Merle Strohbehn of the First Presbyterian Church, which
sponsored the couple, said that in 10 years the Trans had learned
English, built careers and bought a home. Tran was a highly skilled
machinist and his wife was a seamstress, he said.
   State Patrol Lt. Rod Lundgren said it appeared that the
tractor-trailer rig, carrying potatoes, ran a red light. The driver
was being held pending a decision by the county attorney on whether
to file charges.

<HEAD>Oily Water Seeps into Wetlands Area, Flood Control Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surging high tide pushed crude
oil past a series of floating booms and through an earthen barrier
into an environmentally sensitive marsh, coating at least three
birds with oil.
   The oil flowed Sunday into an area of mud flats and pickle weed
that is habitat for federally listed endangered birds. The birds
covered with oil, not members of endangered species, were taken to
be cleaned, said Gary Gorman, director of the Huntington Beach
Wetlands Conservancy.
   ``There is a minor threat there,'' Gorman said. The conservancy
is trying to restore the 25-acre marsh into a wetlands wildlife
habitat.
   Workers from the Orange County Flood Control District rebuilt
the 6-foot-high barrier while cleanup crews tried to contain the
oil, Huntington Beach Fire Battalion Chief Dennis Groat said.
   ``We are back in cycles of higher than average tides,'' Groat
said. ``We also have very strong surf swell out of the south.''
   Tests were being performed to determine if the oil came from the
damaged tanker American Trader, said officials of British
Petroleum, operator of the ship.
   The American Trader, apparently punctured by its own anchor,
spilled 400,000 gallons of crude off Huntington Beach on Feb. 7,
closing 12 miles of Orange County beaches.
   ``There is some concern that this may have been from an upstream
source,'' British Petroleum spokeswoman Marcia Meermans said.
British Petroleum owned the crude oil.
   At least three endangered species _ the California least tern,
the California brown pelican and the Beldings Savannah sparrow _
nest and forage in the marsh.

<HEAD>Supreme Court allows CIA to withhold documents from Texas lawyer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to force the
CIA to release its documents on the 1985 sinking by French
government agents of the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that the spy
agency may withhold the documents from a Houston lawyer who is
seeking them under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
   Greenpeace, an international environmental group, had been
preparing to monitor and protest a scheduled French nuclear weapons
test when its vessel exploded and sank in the Auckland, New
Zealand, harbor July 10, 1985.
   The French government two months later admitted that two of its
intelligence agents, acting on orders from senior officials, had
attached explosive devices to the ship's hull.
   Houston lawyer John R. Knight asked the Central Intelligence
Agency in October 1985 for all documents in its possession dealing
with the Rainbow Warrior sinking. His request was based on the
FOIA, enacted in 1966 to curtail government secrecy.
   The CIA refused to disclose any documents, and Knight then filed
an FOIA lawsuit.
   In resisting disclosure, CIA officials said the documents Knight
sought are ``matters that are ... specifically exempt from
disclosure by statute'' enpowering the CIA director to protect
``intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure.''
   U.S. District Judge Gabrielle K. McDonald ruled for the CIA, and
her ruling was upheld by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last
May.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1985 Supreme Court
decision that gave the CIA unlimited power to conceal from the
public not only the identities of secret agents but also all
sources of intelligence information _ classified and unclassified.
   ``Given the Supreme Court's broad holding in (1985), we conclude
that the CIA must prevail here,'' the appeals court said. ``The
documents are exempt from FOIA disclosure. This is so because the
director of Central Intelligence determined, with full authority to
do so, that the release of the documents could compromise
intelligence sources and methods.''
   The 5th Circuit court added: ``In the absence of bad faith or
some other compelling showing that he has abused his broad
discretion, his determination may not be second-guessed by the
courts.''
   The case is Knight vs. U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 89-878.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against Businessman Who Sold Plans to Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A California businessman sentenced to 15 years
in prison and fined $6.6 million for selling two airplanes to Libya
lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, let stand Edward Elkins' conviction
and sentence for conspiracy and violating U.S. export restrictions.
   Elkins, who owned a Santa Maria, Calif., company that made
armored products, was convicted in a 1987 federal trial in Georgia
of selling the planes for $87 million to a West German company
owned by Libyans. Elkins made a $7 million profit on the sales.
   Prosecutors said Elkins first tried unsuccessfully to get State
Department approval to sell a Lockheed military transport plane to
a Libyan dealer.
   After that failed, prosecutors said Elkins succeeded in getting
an export license from the Commerce Department for two other
Lockheed planes, both L-100-30s.
   The government said the Libyans were told the L-100-30 planes
could be modfied to permit midair refueling so they would be
suitable for military use.
   Elkins never informed Lockheed or Commerce Department officials
that the planes were to be modified, prosecutors said. Prosecutors
said he also told the federal agency the planes were destined for
the tiny nation of Benin.
   Investigators said one plane eventually was found in Cairo,
Egypt, with an operations manual indicating it had been used by the
Libyan Air Force.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld
Elkins' conviction and sentence.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that Elkins was convicted
improperly under a federal anti-fraud law. The appeals court also
upheld instructions the trial judge gave the jury to break a
deadlock, and it ruled that Elkins' sentence was not excessive.
   The case is Elkins vs. U.S., 89-1206.

   Clashes in southeastern Natal
province left at least 13 people dead, authorities said today,
despite a plea by Nelson Mandela for warring black factions to
throw their weapons into the sea.
   Mandela, in a speech Sunday in Durban to about 100,000 people,
said the black factional fighting in Natal hindered the battle
against apartheid, South Africa's policy of racial segregation.
   ``My message to those of you involved in this battle of brother
against brother is this: Take your guns, your knives and your
pangas and throw them into the sea,'' Mandela said. Pangas are
similar to machetes. Police say the violence has claimed about
3,000 lives over the past four years.
   Police with shotguns killed two protesters and wounded four more
today when they fired on a crowd attacking a community center in a
black township near the central town of Kroonstad, police said.
   Two policemen were fatally shot near Pietermaritzburg in Natal
Province late Sunday and two other officers died in separate
attacks nearby, police said.
   Three men died and two were injured in clashes Sunday in Natal
between rival factions, police said. Warring groups burned houses
and huts in two areas of Natal during the fighting, they said.
   The main combatants in Natal are the African National
Congress-aligned United Democratic Front and Inkatha, a relatively
conservative Zulu political group headed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The Zulu leader is a staunch oppenent of apartheid, but he
differs with the ANC over the best way to fight it.
   The ANC favors sanctions, boycotts, strikes and guerrilla
attacks to put pressure on the government. Buthelezi does not
endorse any of these actions and is a proponent of capitalism in
contrast to the socialist-oriented ANC.
   In the black homeland of Venda, two people where killed when
police dispersed a rally Saturday in honor of Mandela, the
independent South African Press Association said in a report that
quoted a witness.
   Also, police said two men were burned to death in Soweto,
outside Johannesburg. The men had car tires placed around their
necks and set alight, a form of attack known as the ``necklace.''
Police said they did not know the motive for the killings.
   In Cape Town, police arrested 25 people demonstrating outside
Parliament in support of relatives at the nearby Robben Island
Prison jailed for politically motivated acts. Police declared the
protest illegal and forced the demonstrators, mostly women, into
vans.
   The anti-apartheid Mass Democratic Movement said 343 men were
participating in a hunger strike at the prison. The Prisons Service
said only that ``a number'' of inmates were not eating.
   The hunger strikers consider themselves political prisoners who
should be freed under reforms initiated by President F.W. de Klerk,
the Mass Democratic Movement said.
   De Klerk has said his government will release people convicted
of belonging to previously outlawed groups that he legalized Feb.
2. However, the government has refused to free activists convicted
of violent crimes.
   De Klerk legalized the African National Congress and other black
opposition groups and released Mandela in a bid to start talks on
ending white-minority rule and sharing power with blacks.
   Mandela today resumed his busy schedule of meetings at his
Soweto home.
   He held talks with Helen Suzman, an anti-apartheid politician
who retired last year after 36 years in Parliament, and Gavin
Relly, chief executive of Anglo American, the world's largest gold
mining firm.
   Mandela, who favors state control of the mines, said afterward:
``Nationalization (of the mines) is the policy of the ANC and it is
a step which is perfectly logical.''
   Relly told reporters he did not discuss nationalization with
Mandela, but said such a policy was ``not practical to make modern
economies work.''
   He leaves Tuesday for the ANC's exile headquarters in Zamiba,
his first stop on an 18-day, four-nation tour.

<TEXT>
   For a decade, Nicaragua has been a troublesome
hotpoint for a succession of three American presidents. Now _ with
the stunning election outcome in Nicaragua _ the region is being
framed as an overnight success for democracy.
   In fact, no matter who had won in Nicaragua, Sunday's balloting
would have struck a key blow for democracy. That's what President
Bush had in mind Sunday when he held out an olive branch to the
winner _ so long as it was a fair and free election.
   And Bush was quick this morning to signal that the U.S.
challenge to Nicaragua was about to end. Morning news of the
election of Violetto Chamarro _ and the defeat of Daniel Ortega and
his Sandinista regime _ spread through Washington like welcome
wildfire.
   ``In this year of remarkable political change,'' said Secretary
of State James Baker III. ``Freedom, I think it's fair to say, won
another victory yesterday in Nicaragua.'' The White House said it
was considering an end to economic sanctions that helped dampen the
Nicaraguan economy. The sanctions, along with military and
political efforts by the United States, bedeviled the Sandinista
government in its effort to establish popular support.
   Central America looked far less promising for the administration
just 10 weeks ago. Panama was still under the rule of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega and there were widespread predictions that the
Sandinista government would either win an outright majority in
Nicaragua _ or might steal Sunday's election rather than accept
defeat.
   The U.S. military ouster of Noriega was achieved at a far lower
cost to the administration than many had predicted. And, in
Nicaragua, an outcome that few had anticipated _ a victory by
Chamorro and a promise by President Ortega to honor it _ actually
has come to pass.
   Ortega may have lost the election but he proved many in
Washington wrong on several counts. During the 1980's, he was
widely perceived here as an anti-democrat intent on touching off a
region-wide revolution that could extend up to the Texas border.
Instead, he oversaw a fair campaign and a free election, the first
in Nicaragua's history, and has said he'll abide by the will of the
voters.
   Secretary of State James Baker III commended Ortega in the same
breath as his praise for Mrs. Chamarro, though he was quick to
provide a pointed reminder that the international community ``will
insist that the decision of the Nicaraguan people be respected and
that full civil and military power be transferred to the newly
elected government.''
   Central America is still on the administration's agenda. The
most serious unresolved problem is the continuing war in El
Salvador. But the Sandinista defeat is bound to have a demoralizing
effect on the leftist FMLN rebels, who are now more isolated than
at any time since they were formed a decade ago.
   Beyond that, if administration allegations about Sandinista arms
shipments to the FMLN are true, Mrs. Chamorro's victory would
appear to add to the insurgency's problems since they will no
longer have Nicaraguan support.
   All this has the eventual potential of returning Central America
to the relative obscurity the region experienced for the first
century and a half of its independence.
   It was an area to which the United States used to pay almost no
attention; former Secretary of State George P. Shultz said one of
his predecessors told him he doubted that he spent more than three
minutes on that issue during his entire time in office.
   With the Sandinista triumph of 1979 followed in short order by
the election of a U.S. president _ Ronald Reagan _ with a well
known aversion for leftists, Central America suddenly was a big
item on Washington's agenda.
   It proved to be one of the most divisive issues of the Reagan
presidency but now it appears those titanic confrontations with the
Congress over aid to the Contra rebels are now history.
   The one immediate concern of the administration is the
disposition of the 70,000 member Sandinista Army, a force whose
loyalty lies with the Sandinista Front and not to the Nicaraguan
state.
   That could create a situation common elsewhere in Latin America
_ a military establishment which acts as an independent force
beyond the reach of the elected authorities.
   Globally, Sunday's election constitutes for leftist forces yet
another in a series of setbacks that began last year in Eastern
Europe. A decade ago in this hemisphere, the left was in power in
Cuba, Nicaragua, Grenada and Suriname. Now only Cuba is left.

<HEAD>Court Agrees To Decide Whether Losers Should Pay Witness Fees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether a federal law requiring some lawsuit losers to pay the
winners' lawyer fees also covers expert-witness fees.
   The court will review a ruling that deprived West Virginia
University's hospital of reimbursement for the $104,000 it spent on
three expert witnesses in successfully suing Pennsylvania.
   The WVU hospital in Morgantown, just six miles from the
Pennsylvania state line, serves numerous Medicaid recipients who
live in Pennsylvania.
   The hospital sued Pennsylvania officials in 1986 in a dispute
over the state's system of reimbursements for Medicaid services
under the Social Security Act.
   U.S. District Judge Sylvia Rambo in 1988 ruled that the
Pennsylvania reimbursement system violated federal law, and ordered
the state to develop a new system.
   She also ordered the state to pay $500,000 in lawyer fees
incurred by the hospital, including $104,000 for expert witnesses
who testified about deficiencies in the payment system for
out-of-state hospitals.
   The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Court of Appeals last Sept. 5
set aside that portion of the award representing most of the
reimbursement for expert-witness fees.
   The appeals court said Congress, in passing the law providing
lawyer-fee awards, did not intend to allow reimbursements for
expert-witness fees.
   Other federal appeals courts have ruled that Congress did intend
to include reimbursement for such fees.
   The 3rd Circuit court noted that federal court rules provide for
the losing side in some cases to pay up to $30 a day for expert
witnesses employed by the winning side.
   The appeals court said the WVU hospital could not be awarded
more than that daily $30.
   In the hospital's appeal acted on today, its lawyers relied
heavily on a Supreme Court decision last year that said lawyer-fee
awards could take the work of paralegals into account.
   ``Just as paralegals assist in the preparation of an attorney's
work product, experts educate counsel and preclude the need for the
attorney to educate himself, which would obviously require more
time and run up an attorney's fees even more,'' the appeal said.
   The case is West Virginia University Hospitals Inc. vs. Casey,
89-994.

<TEXT>
   Twelve tugboats raced against
time today to shepherd the burning U.S.-flagged tanker Surf City
out of the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, shipping executives
said.
   The move was ordered because of fears the tanker could explode
off the coast of the United Arab Emirates and set nearby offshore
oil terminals ablaze, or could sink, clogging the vital Gulf
shipping channel.
   Flames intensified over the weekend when more of the volatile
cargo of naphta and diesel fuel began spilling into parts of the
81,823-ton tanker that were ablaze following an explosion Thursday.
   ``The tugboats are blanketing it with foam and water as it
moves, and the south-to-north wind is also helping cool the
tanker,'' a Gulf-based shipping executive said on condition of
anonymity.
   He estimated the tanker would need at least 10 hours to go
through the Strait of Hormuz and into the open sea, where any
threat to installations on shore would be eliminated.
   An internal explosion Thursday aboard the Surf City, a
Kuwaiti-owned tanker flying the U.S. flag, set the ship alight and
killed two of its 25 American crewmen. The cause of the explosion
has not been determined.
   The U.S. Navy missile frigate USS Simpson rescued 23 crewmen
from lifeboats and 22 were flown from Dubai to the United States
over the weekend. One, Earl Washington, 41, of Louisiana, remained
in a Dubai hospital for treatment of first-degree burns.
   The American warships kept a ``watchful eye'' on the vessel
under tow and radioing warnings to other shipping to steer four
miles clear, the shipping executives said.
   It was unclear why the cargo tanks, 70 percent of which were
reported late Saturday to be still intact, had begun leaking and
feeding the fire later.
   ``Unfortunately ... the fire on board the Surf City has
continued and somewhat intensified,'' said a statement issued by
the Chesapeake Shipping Inc., the company that operates Surf City
and other Kuwaiti tankers re-flagged in the United States.
   The Surf City is one of 11 tankers that Kuwait re-registered at
the height of the Iraq-Iran war to entitle them to U.S. Navy
protection.

   Poor weather forced the launch of
shuttle Atlantis' secret military mission to be scrubbed today for
the fifth time, the most delays since the doomed Challenger.
   NASA set the next attempt for early Wednesday.
   Peekaboo clouds and erratic winds tantalized NASA with possible
launch opportunities for almost two hours early today and officials
kept Atlantis and its five-man crew poised and ready for any
momentary break in the weather.
   But the break never came. At 2:32 a.m. launch director Robert
Sieck abandoned the launch attempt and announced NASA would not try
again until early Wednesday.
   Experts saw little chance that launch weather would improve
later in the week.
   ``We're just in kind of a stalemate because of the weather,''
said Tom Strange, an Air Force weather forecaster. He said there
was only a 20 percent chance of favorable weather on Wednesday and
a 40 percent chance on Thursday.
   Winds and clouds early today were on the very edge of acceptable
limits and NASA extended a pause in the launch countdown in hopes
that the weather would improve. Eventually the winds calmed enough
for launch, but a cloud cover hung on stubbornly and Sieck decided
to give up.
   NASA spokesman Kyle Herring said exhaustion among the
astronauts, launch-pad technicians and engineers played a role in
the decision to delay the next launch attempt until early Wednesday.
   ``We just want to give the crews a rest,'' Herring said.
   Atlantis' commander, Navy Capt. John O. Creighton, said in a
statement today that the crew was disappointed, ``but we are
convinced that the launch team and the mission management team made
the correct decision ... We are looking forward to the next
opportunity.''
   Creighton and two of his crew members, Air Force Col. John H.
Casper, the pilot, and Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, planned to
fly back to the astronaut training base in Houston later today to
practice in a shuttle simulator.
   The shuttle mission originally was scheduled to begin last
Thursday. Two launch attempts were abandoned after Creighton
developed a sore throat and head congestion. An attempt early
Saturday was blocked by unacceptable weather conditions.
   Early Sunday, with clear skies and ideal weather, NASA counted
down to within 31 seconds of launch and then had to call it off
when a computer broke down.
   This mission has been postponed more times than any shuttle
flight since Challenger, which had seven delays and then blew up
shortly after liftoff on its eighth try on Jan. 28, 1986. All seven
crew members died.
   Atlantis' flight is a classified military mission. As a result,
the precise launch time and length of the flight are secret.
   However, sources said the spacecraft is to be launched just
before 1 a.m. EST on Wednesday, is to fly about 4{ days and will
land at Edwards Air Force Base in California.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said
Atlantis' cargo is a $500 million spy satellite capable of taking
high-resolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on
electronics communications all over the world. Atlantis is to
deploy the satellite in an orbit that will carry the craft over
more of the Soviet Union than any satellite previously launched by
a shuttle.
   The other crew members are mission specialists Air Force Col.
Richard Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   The Atlantis flight is to be the 34th shuttle mission, the sixth
classified military flight, and the fourth after-dark shuttle
launch.

   The Supreme Court today left intact the U.S.
military's general ban on homosexuals serving in the Army and Navy.
   The court, without comment, rejected appeals by a woman denied
re-enlistment in the Army Reserve in Wisconsin because she is a
lesbian and a California man released from Navy active duty because
he is gay.
   The action today was not a ruling on the legality of the
military ban but simply a summary rejection of the appeals. The
justices did not preclude the possibility that in some future case
they will agree to review the policy toward homosexuals.
   In other actions, the Supreme Court:
   _Said it will decide whether a federal law that requires some

   Army Reserve Sgt. Miriam Ben-Shalom, 41, is stationed in
Milwaukee and has been allowed to remain in the military pending
the outcome of her appeal on the homosexuality issue.
   Ms. Ben-Shalom joined the Army Reserve in 1974, and was
discharged in 1976 because she is an acknowledged lesbian. The Army
policy at the time barred anyone who ``evidenced homosexual
tendencies, desire or interest,'' even though never having engaged
in any ``overt homosexual acts.''
   A federal judge ordered Ms. Ben-Shalom reinstated, and she
served out an enlistment that ended in August 1988.
   She then was prohibited from re-enlisting under an amended Army
regulation.
   The new policy says, ``Homosexuality is incompatible with
military service,'' and bars ``persons who engage in homosexual
conduct or who by their statements demonstrate a propensity to
engage in homosexual conduct.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last August upheld the
revised policy.
   The appeals court, although acknowledging there never has been
any complaint about Ms. Ben-Shalom's performance of her military
duties, said the Army has acted to protect ``morale, discipline and
the effectiveness of our fighting forces.''
   Judges should not put the Army's interests at risk by imposing
change ``with possible consequences we cannot safely evaluate,''
the appeals court said.
   James M. Woodward of Spring Valley, Calif., challenged the
Navy's general ban on homosexuals.
   He enlisted in 1972 for a six-year hitch in the Naval Flight
Officer Candidate Program.
   He was allowed to enter the Naval Reserve program even though he
had answered ``yes'' to a questionnaire that asked whether he was
sexually attracted to men or desired sex with men. Woodward
answered ``no'' to a question whether he had ever engaged in
homosexual conduct.
   He completed flight school training and was commissioned as an
ensign in the Naval Reserve.
   Woodward was serving in an air squadron stationed in the
Philippines when in 1974 he was seen in the Subic Bay Officers'
Club sitting with a sailor who was to be discharged for homosexual
conduct.
   The Navy generally bars homosexuals but has retained some.
   When questioned by his commanding officer, Woodward acknowledged
his homosexual tendencies. After Woodward refused to resign, the
commanding officer recommended to the chief of naval personnel that
Woodward be discharged.
   In a letter to that official, Woodward said, ``For the good of
both the Navy and myself, I respectfully request the chance to
contribute to the defense of the United States as an honest, open,
`gay' officer.''
   The Navy did not discharge Woodward but released him from active
duty and assigned him to the Naval Air Reserve staff in San Diego.
He served there until 1978, when he was discharged after completing
his six-year military obligation.
   Woodward sued in 1976, alleging that he had been unlawfully
separated from active duty. The suit sought back pay and
reinstatement.
   The U.S. Claims Court dismissed Woodward's suit, and the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the dismissal last
March 29.
   ``Woodward was not discharged for homosexuality; rather he was
considered for reassignment, but because of his mediocre record as
an officer and his homosexuality he was ultimately released from
active duty,'' the appeals court said.
   Bush administration lawyers urged the high court to reject the
appeals by Woodward and Ms. Ben-Shalom.
   The cases are Woodward vs. U.S., 89-344, and Ben-Shalom vs.
Marsh, 89-876.

   The human rights situation in Romania has improved
markedly since the revolution that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu, but
fear, suspicion, and distrust linger on, according to a U.N. report
released today.
   The report mentioned death threats against politicians and wide
concern that the Securitate, Ceausescu's repressive secret police,
may be still active although the new leadership says it has been
disbanded.
   It also said the problem of ethnic minorities in Romania will
require ``close examination and adequate measures'' and that the
launching and distribution of printed media is ``not yet fully
assured.''
   The report was compiled by Swiss jurist Joseph Voyame, under a
1988 mandate from the 43-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission.
Voyame spent five days in Romania earlier this month on an
invitation from the new leadership.
   He was barred from Romania while Ceausescu held power and a
first report based on sources outside Romania was dated Dec. 18,
shortly before the dictator was deposed and later executed.
   His French-language update, prepared for the U.N. commission's
current session, said human rights in Romania have ``not yet been
fully restored'' but that the situation has ``considerably
improved.'' It stated, however, the ``climate of suspicion and
fear'' that prevailed under Ceausescu was likely to vanish only
gradually.
   ``In the meantime, the manipulation of public opinion remains to
be feared,'' the report said.
   Voyame cited testimony that a member of the national Peasants
Party was slain in the town of Bacau, and that there were ``several
cases of violent death among members of the Hungarian minority.''
   In the report, Voyame said he was also informed that a critic of
the National Salvation Front, the new leadership, was killed in a
``car accident under circumstances that are still unclear.''
   ``In addition to these signs of physical violence, certain
measures of psychological intimidation are said to continue,'' he
said. ``Numerous persons have informed the special investigator of
death threats against themselves, against members of their
families, or against people they know.''
   Voyame said witnesses ``from non-official circles criticized the
fact that there is no precise information on how the problem of the
Securitate has been resolved.''

<NOTE>Eds: Mercedel correct in 7th graf, Torregano's mother</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear an
appeal by the mother of a seaman stabbed to death aboard a ship in
what was described as a vicious attack by another crew member.
   The court said it will use the case from New Orleans to consider
increasing the damages ship owners, and possibly unions, may be
forced to pay to parents and other heirs of slain sailors.
   The issues are whether the heirs are entitled to damages for the
dead seaman's lost future wages and compensation for parents'
``loss of society.''
   The case stems from an incident aboard the Archon during its
maiden voyage while the ship was docked in Washington state on July
18, 1984.
   The victim, Ludwick Torregano, 24, a steward's assistant, was
stabbed or cut at least 62 times by fellow crew member Clifford
Melrose.
   Melrose later was convicted of second-degree murder in Clark
County, Wash.
   Torregano's mother, Mercedel Miles, sued the ship owners and
operators in federal court in New Orleans.
   Ms. Miles, administrator of her son's estate, was awarded
$140,000 for the pain and suffering Torregano endured before his
death and $7,800 for the loss of her son's support.
   But the jury refused to order additional damages for the loss of
Torregano's future income or for loss of society by either Ms.
Miles or the seaman's father, Joseph O. Torregano.
   Loss of society is defined as a broad range of mutual benefits
family members receive from each other, including love, affection,
care, attention, companionship, comfort and protection.
   The 5th U.S. Supreme Court of Appeals last September upheld the
damages awarded by the jury.
   The appeals court also ruled that under maritime law the Archon
was unseaworthy because Melrose was among its crew.
   ``The savagery of (Melrose's) attack itself leads us to conclude
that Melrose has an especially dangerous disposition,'' the appeals
court said. ``Melrose failed to measure up to the standard of his
calling and rendered the vessel unseaworthy.''
   That opened the way for increased damages against the Archon's
owners and operators. But the appeals court then said that
Torregano's parents are not entitled to compensation for loss of
his future wages or for their loss of their son's society.
   Only dependents are entitled to be compensated for loss of
society when a seaman dies, the appeals court said.
   ``The number of plaintiffs who could allege a loss of love and
affection as a result of the death of a dearly beloved seaman _
aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews, even friends and lovers _
necessitates that we draw a line between those who may recover for
loss of society and those who may not,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also ruled that the Seafarers International
Union may be sued by the ship owners and operators for its role in
permitting Melrose to be hired as a member of the Archon crew.
   That means the union eventually could be forced to help pay any
compensation awarded Ms. Miles.
   The case is Miles vs. Apex Marine, 89-1158.

<HEAD>Soviet Troop Withdrawal from Czechoslovakia Begins</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRENSTAT, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-two Soviet tanks left
this northern Moravian city today, beginning the Red Army's
withdrawal from Czechoslovakia nearly 22 years after Moscow sent
troops to crush ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Few people came to wave goodbye and those who did showed little
emotion.
   A brass band struck up the ``Internationale,'' the Communist
anthem, during a brief ceremony inside the Soviet base at Frenstat
that kicked off the first complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from
any of Moscow's allies.
   The Soviet troops entered Czechoslovakia with a Warsaw Pact
invasion that smashed the 1968 reforms. But in November 1989, a
peaceful revolution toppled the hard-line Communists and the new
government immediately began talks on withdrawing all Red Army
troops.
   To Czechoslovaks, the Soviet troops ``meant empty shelves in
stores, polluted water, an occasional fight in the pub and a
reminder that we are not a free country,'' said Karel Micek, a
spokesman for the Civic Forum movement.
   Withdrawal of the 73,500 Soviet troops stationed on Czechoslovak
territory is to be completed by the end of next year.
   The withdrawal from Frenstat pod Radhostem, 110 miles southeast
of Prague, was accompanied by a parallel pullout from Krnov on the
Czechoslovak-Polish border, 150 miles east of the Czechoslovak
capital. They are to be completed by March 13 and March 25
respectively.
   ``This is our new peace policy in practice ... a retreat from
the policy of confrontation,'' Gen. Vladimir Malyshkievich, deputy
chief of the Soviet contingent in Czechoslovakia, said during the
ceremony.
   ``It is only proper this process starts in the center of Europe
and on the day of the official visit of President Vaclav Havel in
the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Havel flew to Moscow today for two days of talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, just three days after returning
from the United States, where he met with President Bush. Havel and
Gorbachev are expected to sign the agreement on troop withdrawals
concluded in Prague on Feb. 22.
   The accord provides for a Soviet pullout in three stages, with a
``decisive part of the contingent'' leaving the country by the end
of May. The first free elections in Czechoslovakia since the
Communists consolidated power in 1948 are due in June.
   Czechoslovakia originally demanded the withdrawal by the end of
199O, but the Soviets, citing administrative problems, requested
the deadline be extended until the end of 1991.
   The first of the T-62 tanks left Frenstat by train in the
afternoon, en route to the Soviet border.
   ``Most probably they will reach the border some time tomorrow,''
said Stanislav Pohoral, a Defense Ministry spokesman.
   No official figures have been released on the number of troops
affected by today's pullbacks. But Vadim Pliska, a Soviet soldier
posted in Frenstat said ``some 2,000 soldiers and approximately 9O
tanks'' were stationed there.
   Moscow currently has 73,500 soldiers, 1,22O tanks, 2,5O5 armored
vehicles, 77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters stationed on
Czechoslovak soil.

   Nicaragua's presidential election drew praise today as a model
of democracy and a step toward peace after more than 10 years of
rebel warfare.
   Opposition candidate Violeta Barrios de Chamorro defeated
President Daniel Ortega in elections Sunday and said the results
showed the Nicaraguan people ``want to live in democracy, in peace
and in freedom.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter, invited to monitor the balloting
in the Central American nation, called the process free and fair
and said Ortega had promised to abide by the result.
   He also praised Ortega and the leftist Sandinistas for promoting
a free election.
   ``They had total control over the government, over the electoral
process,'' Carter told ABC television. ``I think Ortega can go out
of office in April ... with a great deal of satisfaction that he
has indeed been instrumental in letting the people exhibit
democracy and freedom in one of its finest ways in this
hemisphere.''
   U.S. officials welcomed the result and pledged help to
Nicaragua. The United States supported a decade-long insurgency
against Ortega's Sandinista government and imposed an economic
embargo to undermine Managua's economy.
   ``The United States looks forward to working with Mrs.
Chamorro's new government in support of her stated goals of
national reconciliation and economic reconstruction, and with
President (Daniel) Ortega in helping assure a peaceful transition
of power,'' President Bush said in a statement read by his
spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Bush was sending messages to Mrs. Chamorro,
congratulating her on her win, and to Ortega, ``congratulating him
on the conduct of the election and his stated willingness to abide
by the results.''
   ``In this year of political change, democracy won another
victory,'' Bush said in his statement.
   In Spain, Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez praised
the Nicaraguan electoral process and result.
   ``They augur well for the future of the country,'' he told
reporters meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   Hurd said, ``This is very good news for Nicaragua, for Latin
America, for everyone.''
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
welcomed the Nicaraguan elections as a ``victory for democracy.''
   Perez de Cuellar said, ``I am very pleased about the elections
(which) took place in a very democratic manner.
   ``I think this is a great success for democracy in Nicaragua and
also Central America,'' he said. ``It is a great thing for Central
America and all Latin America and the whole hemisphere, and
European countries.''
   Perez de Cuellar emphasized he was not expressing support for
the outcome of the election and said he had remained neutral in
Chamorro's contest with Ortega.

<HEAD>Teachers Want States to Require Geography</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teachers want geography _ a distant subject to
many young Americans _ to be among the courses required for high
school graduation, according to a survey released Monday.
   The nationwide survey of 852 elementary and secondary school
social studies and geography teachers found 86 percent favored
changing requirements to require that high school students pass a
geography course in order to graduate. Eighty-seven percent want
state governments to increase geography requirements.
   The Rand McNally Report on Geography Education in America,
conducted by Ketchum Communications Research and Measurement, comes
on the heels of the first study of geography education by the
National Assessment of Educational Progress _ popularly known as
the Nation's Report Card.
   That report said high school seniors have a gap in their
knowledge of geography, with only 37 percent able to find Southeast
Asia on a world map. The average student could answer just 57
percent of the questions and the best score among more than 3,000
students tested was 59 percent, the report showed.
   Nine out of 10 teachers polled by Rand McNally said the quality
of geography education American children currently receive could be
considered poor or only fair.
   Unless geography education improves, 85 percent of the teachers
said that U.S. citizens will not be able to adequately understand
the importance of present and future environmental issues. And 83
percent said that other countries with citizens educated in
geography will have competitive business advantages over the United
States.
   The survey findings indicate that geography is not receiving
ample time in the classroom because it is taught as part of a
broader subject, such as history or social studies, said Dennis
DeCock of Rand McNally. He said 90 percent of those surveyed said
more classroom time should be spent on geography.
   Requiring high school students to pass a geography course to
graduate is one of the keys to restoring geography teaching to its
proper role, the teachers said.
   Seventy-two percent of those surveyed said most teachers have
not received adequate training themselves in geography and
therefore do not teach it well or at all. Eighty-nine percent said
teachers of geography should be provided supplemental geography
education.
   The teachers surveyed included members of the National Council
for the Social Studies and the National Council for Geographic
Education.
   Rand McNally, a leading producer of maps and geography teaching
materials, said it has established an awards program for teachers
who display creative classroom approaches to teaching geography.
The program is co-sponsored by the National Council for Geographic
Education and will feature a $10,000 cash prize.

   A Frenchman and a Scottish-born American were
named on Monday to share the 1990 Wolf Prize for physics.
   The $100,000 award, to be presented in the Israeli parliament
May 20, will be given to Pierre-Gilles de Gennes of the College of
France in Paris and David J. Thouless of the University of
Washington in Seattle, the Wolf Foundation said.
   De Gennes and Thouless were selected for their ``pioneering
contributions to our understanding of the organization of complex
condensed-matter systems,'' the foundation said.
   De Gennes, 57, has held the chair in condensed-matter physics at
the College of France since 1971.
   The foundation praised him for developing basic concepts in the
physics of macromolecular matter and of liquid crystals.
   Thouless, 55, earned his doctorate in physics at Cornell
University in 1958. He has been in Washington state since 1980.
   The foundation said he was cited for contributions to
understanding disordered and twin-layered matter.
   Winners already have been named in mathematics, agriculture,
medicine, chemistry and the arts.
   The Wolf Prizes were established in 1975 to honor the late
Ricardo Wolf. The German-born inventor immigrated to Cuba before
World War I and later served as its ambassador to Israel. He died
in 1981.

<HEAD>Belgrade Stock Exchange Resumes Trading After 50-YearBreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Belgrade stock exchange, the
first of its kind in Communist-ruled Yugoslavia, resumed trading
today after a break of almost half a century.
   ``The Yugoslav Capital Market _ Belgrade,'' will be the first of
three stock exchanges set up in Yugoslavia this year, said
Branislav Cosic, deputy manager of the new exchange. The other two
will open in the northern cities of Zagreb and Ljubljana, he said,
without giving a date.
   The Belgrade exchange, founded by four of Yugoslavia's largest
banks, initially will handle only government bonds, but soon will
start trading stocks issued by private companies, Cosic said.
   In the first day, ``no bonds or stocks offered by the four
founding banks were exchanged,'' Cosic said. He said today ``was
just an experimental day for future activities,'' but did not
elaborate on the start-up operation.
   The Belgrade exchange, first established in 1886, folded in
1941, when Yugoslavia was occupied by Nazi Germany. When the
Communists seized power in 1945, th Americans are smoking fewer cigarettes,
but an
Agriculture Department economist says demand continues to grow in
the rest of the world.
   Last year, the per capita use of cigarettes in the United States
was estimated at 2,936 ``pieces'' or fewer than 149 packs of 20
cigarettes each, down about 5 percent from the 1988 rate.
   The per capita use has declined for 16 straight years, said
Verner Grise of the department's Economic Research Service. At its
peak in 1963, use averaged 4,345 cigarettes, or more than 217 packs.
   Per capita consumption is based on all persons 18 or older,
smokers and non-smokers alike. It does not indicate actual smoking
habits and is used by the agency for year-to-year comparisons.
   But world cigarette trade increased about 12 percent, Grise said
in the March issue of Farmline magazine.
   ``Shipments from the United States, West Germany, the
Netherlands, Hong Kong (which is also an importer) and the United
Kingdom were up, while those from Bulgaria and Belgium-Luxembourg
were down,'' he said. ``Together, these seven countries account for
about 84 percent of total world exports.''
   Among the cigarette importing countries, the most important
markets are the Soviet Union, France, Japan, Italy, Hong Kong and
Turkey.
   During the first nine months of 1989, U.S. cigarette exports
were up 16 percent from a year earlier, with all the major markets
buying more, Grise said. In the ``relatively small markets,'' sales
also rose in South America but declined in Australia-Oceania and
Canada.

   Australia, one of the world's biggest meat
producers, is consuming less of its beef and lamb, according to an
Agriculture Department dispatch from Canberra.
   ``They are eating more breakfast cereals, desserts, fruits and
vegetables, but less meat, bakery products and canned vegetables,
according to a recent survey,'' the report said.
   As reported in Retail World, an Australian publication, the
value of retail purchases of meat and deli items dropped 33 percent
from 1988 to 1989, while bakery products and canned vegetables each
declined 14 percent.
   But purchases of breakfast cereals rose 25 percent; desserts, 20
percent; and fruits and vegetables, 22 percent.
   The item was reported in AgExporter magazine by the department's

Pennsylvania. In 1988, the hospital won its suit against
Pennsylvania officials in a dispute over the state's system of
reimbursements for Medicaid services under the Social Security Act.

<TEXT>
   A killer who preys on homeless people
sleeping on the sidewalks of India's largest city has struck again,
police said Monday, beating to death an 11th victim: a teen-age
railroad porter.
   The body of the youth, his head bashed in and a blood-stained
rock lying nearby, was found by police shortly after midnight under
an overpass near eastern Calcutta's Sealdah railroad station,
officers said.
   The area houses shops which normally stay open past midnight,
but an electrical failure _ common in Calcutta _ had blacked out
street lights and shops.
   Police officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
victim was about 14 years old and had been working as an unlicensed
baggage porter at the nearby train station. His name was not
immediately known.
   The killer, dubbed the ``Stone Man'' by police, killed his first
known victim June 4. The toll reached seven by September and
climbed to 10 on Feb. 20.
   All of the victims were pavement dwellers, homeless people who
sleep on the sidewalks of this city of 10 million.
   The railroad porter, like previous victims, was sleeping alone.
Most of Calcutta's homeless people sleep in groups, especially
since the killings began.
   Estimates of the number of pavement sleepers range from the
65,000 suggested by city officials to as many as 1 million reported
by Calcutta newspapers.
   Police have arrested several people in sweeps through the city,
but no one has been charged.

   The U.S. trade embargo against Nicaragua was
first imposed by former President Reagan on May 1, 1985, and was
continued by President Bush last Oct. 25.
   Bush said at the time that Nicaragua posed ``an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States.''
   He added, however, that if Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega
held fair elections and implemented democratic reforms ``the
emergency that prompted the imposition of the trade sanctions would
largely be resolved.''
   Ortega's leftist Sandinista government was defeated in Sunday's
election.
   The embargo bars imports from Nicaragua and bans U.S. exports to
that country except to support Contra rebels. It also prohibits
Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the United States.

   President Bush told the nation's governors
today that adoption of national education goals was ``a new era''
with high expectations and results for the country's schools.
   Bush met with the governors at the White House and hailed the
the fact that ``for the first time in history we now have national
education goals and objectives.''
   The six goals set for the year 2000 were set forth by Bush in
his State of the Union address and endorsed over the weekend by the
governors at their annual midwinter meeting.
   ``We're launching a new era in education reform,'' the president
said. ``Its focus, high expectations; its hallmark, results.''
   Gov. Booth Gardner of Washington, vice chairman of the National
Governors' Association, said the goals would changes the nation's
schools from being ``a place where people have an opportunity to
learn to a place where we ensure that all students will learn.''
   The governors made only minor changes in Bush's six goals. Their
proposal to give education a share of any savings in defense
spending was relegated to a resolution one Democratic governor said
was so bland that no one could object.
   At a White House dinner for the governors Sunday night, Bush
toasted them and ``our commitment to work together toward ... an
American education system that is second to none.''
   ``We came together not as Republicans and Democrats, not as
partisan competitors, but as fellow chief executives with our
hearts and minds focused on a single goal: the future of our kids,
the future of our country,'' said Bush.
   Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, chairman of the governors
association, said, ``We all expect that there's a lot of work ahead
of us.''
   Bush outlined the six goals in his State of the Union address
last month. The governors spent two days tinkering with the
language before they approved the goals and added a list of
objectives for attaining them.
   The goals call for giving poor youngsters preschool services
that include nutrition and health screening and making sure
American students are competent in math, science, English, history
and geography.
   Attached to the goals is a document seeking a commitment ``to
provide at least one year of preschool for all disadvantaged
children.'' It also said, ``federal funds should target those
students most in need of assistance due to economic disadvantage or
risk of academic failure.''
   The resolution on defense savings called on the president ``to
dedicate the peace dividend in a balanced manner among the federal
budget deficit, education'' and other domestic programs.
   New Jersey Gov. James Florio said the language ``is so
generalized, I don't know how anybody can be unhappy with that.''
   The governors rejected a proposal by Democratic Gov. Roy Romer
of Colorado urging the president to ``direct substantial federal
resources from defense to educational needs and other productivity
investments.''
   Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, gave the
governors no promises and said any defense savings would be less
than many are predicting.
   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle won adoption of a resolution
calling on the governors to publicize the goals within their states.
   ```I don't believe the mere announcement of these goals by the
president or the governors in this country is going to change
education as dramatically as we'd like it to,'' Castle said. ``It's
only going to happen if we now carry the word out.''
   Education leaders generally favored the goals, although some
complained there was no clear resolution of funding or how
students' achievement would be assessed.
   ``The goals are good ones. They give us something to work for,''
said Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association.
``The difficult task now comes in (determining) who's responsible
for implementing them, how we're going to put together a long-range
plan on the federal role, the state role and the local role.''
   Timothy Dyer, the new president of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals, said, ``America's governors receive an
A-plus for rhetoric, but fail economics. Their goals are lofty,
patriotic, noble and certainly what we all would like. However,
without resources they are merely wishes.''

   Here are President Bush's remarks Monday to
the National Governors' Association about Sunday's election in
Nicaragua:
   Any friend of democracy can take heart in the fact that Violeta
Chamorro won the election. And the election process, by all
accounts free and fair, is a credit to the people of Nicaragua who
chose to determine their nature's future _ nation's future at the
ballot box. And that is a victory for democracy.
   Yesterday's election moves us one step closer to the day when
every nation in this hemisphere is a democracy, and I'll soon send
messages _ I think they may have already gone out to _ to Mrs.
Chamorro, congratulating her on her victory; to President Ortega,
congratulating him on the conduct of the election and on his pledge
to stand by its results; to President Carter and his counterpart on
that one, Dan Evans; to Mr. Soares of the OAS; to Perez de Cuellar
and Elliot Richardson of the United Nations for their leading roles
in observing the elections.
   In the next few days, I'll be speaking with Central and South
American leaders. This morning I talked to President Carlos Andres
Perez of Venezuela about appropriate trade and economic measures
that we can take to support the new government of Nicaragua.
   We hope now for a peaceful transition, for the
institutionalization of the democratic process in Nicaragua, and
there is space in a democratic Nicaragua for all political points
of view.
   Given a clear mandate for peace and democracy, there is no
reason at all for further military activity from any quarter, and
we hope the cease-fire will be reestablished without delay, and
respected by all sides.
   For years the people of Nicaragua have suffered, and today the
people of Nicaragua have spoken. And now is the time for Nicaragua
to move forward to freedom.

   President Bush today hailed Violeta Chamorro's
upset election in Nicaragua and called for ``peaceful transition''
to democratic rule. Administration officials said he would decide
swiftly on lifting the economic sanctions that hindered the
Sandinista government.
   Bush said there was ``no reason at all for further military
activity from any quarter.'' For most of a decade, Contra rebels
supported by the United States have waged war against President
Daniel Ortega.
   Bush spoke as key members of Congress said the United States
should anticipate providing substantial economic aid to the new
government in Managua.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III embraced Mrs. Chamarro's
triumph and praised the defeated Nicaraguan president for carrying
out a fair election. He said he hoped the election would lead to a
national reconciliation.
   Said Bush: ``For years the people of Nicaragua have suffered.
And today the people of Nicaragua have spoken.''
   The president said he had talked with Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez about ``appropriate trade and economic measures
that we can take to support the new government of Nicaragua.''
   Bush didn't address the issue of sanctions directly. But White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president would decide
``fairly soon'' on whether to lift them, and there already were
calls in Congress for the president to do just that.
   The United States employed a variety of military, economic and
political challenges to Ortega's Sandinistas over the past nine
years and the sanctions were likely a factor in the weak Nicaraguan
economy.
   ``We must provide her new government with aid, and let's not kid
ourselves _ it will take big bucks,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``She needs our help and she deserves it,'' he
said of Mrs. Chamorro.
   ``Nobody said democracy was cheap,'' added Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla. He said he was confident
``the commitment was there'' among lawmakers to provide financial
help.
   The trade embargo against the nation of 3 million was imposed by
President Reagan on May 1, 1985. It bars imports from Nicaragua and
bans U.S. exports to that country except to support the Contra
rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government. It also
prohibits Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from entering the United
States.
   The challenge to Ortega was a controversial hallmark of the
Reagan years, but last year Bush abandoned his military support of
the Contra rebels.
   In brief comments to the nation's governors gathered at the
White House, Bush offered congratulations to Mrs. Chamorro on her
victory and to Ortega for permitting the fair elections to be held.
   He said there is ``space in a democratic Nicaragua for all
political points of view.''
   Fitzwater addressed the question of lifting sanctions when he
spoke with reporters two hours before the president made his
comments.
   ``The president is beginning a series of meetings this morning
to consider all these questions coming out the election,''
Fitzwater said. The sanctions, Fitzwater added, ``are a matter of
first consideration.''
   ``We certainly would like to'' lift the sanctions, Fitzwater
said.
   ``It's a time of celebration,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``In this year of political change, democracy won another
victory,'' Bush said in an earlier, written statement. ``I am most
pleased that there has been a free and fair election in Nicaragua
and that the results are being accepted by both sides.''
   Fitzwater was asked if Bush had been surprised that Ortega, whom
the president last October had ridiculed as an ``unwanted animal at
a garden party,'' had accepted the outcome so graciously. ``No,''
the spokesman said. He said that Ortega beforehand said that, if he
lost, he would help with a transition ``that's smooth and
effective.''
   Baker went out of his way to ``commend Daniel Ortega and the
Sandinista government for carrying out his commitment to conduct
elections under international supervision.''
   Bush said that in addition to his talks with Venezuela's
president, he would talk with other Latin leaders concerning
economic and trade issues. Mrs. Chamorro is expected to take office
April 25.
   Fitzwater said the president was ``confident the international
community will strongly support the results of yesterday's
elections and will join in the effort to help all Nicaraguans
rebuild their country.''
   The White House spokesman said that the administration hoped
that the cease-fire, which Ortega had declared an end to last fall,
``will be re-established immediately and respected by all sides.''
   He added, ``We need a little time to absorb all the election
process. We intend to consider this in an orderly and methodical
fashion.
   ``We hope that all sides in this hotly fought contest will
extend the hand of reconciliaton and cooperate together in
rebuilding their country for the good of all Nicaraguans,'' the
president's statement said.
   Baker, appearing at a meeting of the National Governors'
Association, pointedly said the international community ``will
insist that the decision of the Nicaraguan people be respected and
that full civil and military power be transferred to the newly
elected government.''
   ``In this year of remarkable political change,'' said Baker
``Freedom, I think it's fair to say, won another victory yesterday
in Nicaragua.
   ``We must show President-elect Chamorro and Nicaragua and those
elected with her that we are prepared to work with them to make
certain the sanctions are lifted,'' said Lugar. ``I would hope that
the Congress and the president will be generous with economic
assistance to that torn country.''
   Baker called for reinstating the cease-fire between the
Sandinistas and Contra opponents which have continued their armed
opposition. ``We hope all sides in this hotely fought contest will
extend the hand of national reconciliation,'' Baker said.
   Baker spoke shortly after the Supreme Electoral Council
announced in Managua that with about 60 percent of precincts
counted, Mrs. Chamorro had 459,655 votes, or 54.8 percent, to
Ortega's 347,778, or 41.5 percent. Eight other parties split what
little remained.
   On Sunday, relishing the very existence of elections in
Nicaragua, Bush told reporters, ``If these elections are
certifiably free and fair, whoever wins the election will find a
better climate in which to improve relations with Nicaragua.''
   Former President Carter and thousands of international observers
had closely scrutinized Sunday's peaceful balloting and Carter
proclaimed it fair. The Sandinistas took power during Carter's
presidency in a revolution that toppled dictator Anastasio Somoza.

   He's at home on the range and has
starred in more westerns than John Wayne, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry
combined. He's also comfortable at polo matches or racetracks.
   Lynn Anderson and Sissy Spacek love him, as do Robert Redford,
Burt Reynolds, George Strait, Tommy Lee Jones and Romanian
gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi. Country-western's Michael Martin
Murphy wrote a song in his honor.
   He's made some investors instant millionaires, and admirers are
expected to risk $300 million on his performance this year.
   At 5 feet tall, he sounds a bit short, and at 1,100 pounds,
maybe more than a tad hefty. But what the heck. You'd be husky,
too, if you ate like a horse.
   And that's what we're talking about here. Horses. Quarter
horses, really.
   The American Quarter Horse Association, founded here 50 years
ago, returns this week to celebrate its golden anniversary and
honor what it calls ``America's Horse.''
   Thoroughbred breeders may lift a skeptical eyebrow, but
according to the association, the versatile American quarter horse
is:
   _ Skilled in disciplines ranging from cattle cutting to polo.
   _ Unequaled as a racehorse in sprint distances. The horse got
its name from its burst of speed in quarter-mile races down the
dirt streets of early settlements.
   _ The quickest horse in the world. Quarter horses are renowned
for their lightning getaways, bursting from a starting gate to 45
mph in three strides.
   _ The world's finest roping, reining and cutting horse.
   _ The nation's most popular breed and the only breed indigenous
to this country.
   The quarter horse even helped win the Old West _ the real one,
not Hollywood's version.
   ``I'd agree with all those things,'' said Benny Scott of Fort
Worth, former owner and publisher of Quarter Horse Racing. ``But if
one word best sums up the quarter horse, it's versatility.
   ``And there's no question about popularity because the breed has
the most horses in its registry.''
   The quarter horse association claims the largest equine registry
in the world, nearly 3 million, and the largest membership,
250,000, including 17,750 members in 62 other countries.
   ``The growth of the American quarter horse in international
markets is the most exciting development in the breed in the last
decade,'' said Brad Tate, the association's president. ``It's as if
investors and ranchers around the world have fallen in love with
America's horse.''
   He said exports were up more than 20 percent in 1989 and the
total export value grew to $26,818,000.
   Quarter horse racing is also increasing dramatically. The
Amarillo-based association estimates 16,000 such races will be
staged this year with purses totaling $60 million and wagering
exceeding $300 million.
   The Labor Day All-American Futurity, crown jewel of quarter
horse racing, offers a $2 million purse _ $96,909 per second over
the quarter mile. In 1988, the winner of the race at Ruidoso, N.M.,
covered the distance in 22 seconds, and its owner earned $1 million
on a horse purchased for $9,000.
   Next year, the association will open the American Quarter Horse
Heritage Center and Museum in Amarillo to showcase the horse's
historical role and house the group's hall of fame.
   This week's anniversary celebration kicks off Thursday at Billy
Bob's Texas with a reception honoring quarter horse owners from
around the world.
   Billy Bob's modestly bills itself as the world's largest honky
tonk, and spokeswoman Becky Tillson likens the international
reception to a ``United Nations of horsemen in cowboy hats
jabbering in German, Italian, Spanish and Japanese.''
   Horses are coming in from as far as New York, Montana and
England.
   A ``Versatility Challenge'' on Sunday will match five of the
nation's top American quarter horses competing in a variety of
categories for a somewhat token $5,000.
   ``Spectators will have the rare opportunity of seeing in one
arena the paragons of the breed in performance,'' said Tate.

   Vulnerable older Americans are being duped
into buying expensive nursing home insurance policies that fail to
deliver the promised protection against staggering long-term care
costs, a private advocacy group said Monday.
   The Families USA Foundation called for a government probe into
what it said are widespread abuses in the long-term care insurance
market, including misrepresentations by insurance agents, company
refusals to pay benefits and extensive payment delays.
   ``There is so much evidence of insurance industry abuse of frail
elderly consumers that the Federal Trade Commission should
investigate,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of the
foundation. The problems include top-rated companies as well as
fly-by-night operations, the foundation said.
   In one case, it said, an insurance agent visited a 74-year-old
widow in Minnesota in the hospital to collect her first premium,
and later denied her nursing home benefits because she was
hospitalized when she bought the policy.
   In another, an elderly Iowa man was promised he need never worry
about paying for a nursing home if he bought a policy that turned
out to be so restrictive it would not cover 97 percent of the
nursing home beds in Iowa.
   The Health Insurance Association of America issued a statement
in response that said it would welcome an FTC investigation
``because we are convinced it will reveal that abuses are the
exception, not the rule.''
   It said Families USA was calling for a government inquiry in
hopes of promoting ``an outdated, big-government approach to
long-term care.''
   Families USA believes the best solution to the long-term care
problem is a broad-based social insurance program akin to Social
Security or Medicare, with private insurance playing only a
supplementary role.
   An estimated 40 percent of all elderly will spend some time in a
nursing home, with half of all stays lasting six months or less and
the other half averaging 2{ years, according to the health
insurance association.
   Long-term care insurance was virtually non-existent before 1980
but the market has grown rapidly in recent years because of rising
concern about the high cost of nursing home care, which averages
more than $2,000 a month. More than 100 insurance companies now
offer nursing home insurance and more than 1.3 million policies
have been purchased.
   Families USA said it was asking Congress to seek an FTC probe
into alleged unfair business practices in the nursing home market.
   The move was welcomed by two members by the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which is
conducting its own investigation into nursing home insurance.
   Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who chairs both the full
committee and its oversight subcommittee, said the foundation's
report was in line with what his investigators are finding.
   ``When untamed avarice and constant prevarication become the
trademarks of a product, it is time for reform,'' Dingell said in a
statement.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also on the subcommittee, said the
report would provide added impetus for federal regulation of the
nursing home insurance market. ``It may well be necessary to have
national minimum standards for private long-term care insurance,''
Wyden said.
   Currently, roughly half of nursing home costs are paid by
individuals and the other half by the government, mainly through
Medicaid. Medicaid coverage of nursing home costs is available only
after people become impoverished.

   As fast as you can, repeat the following five times: A potty
parity proposal is pending in Pennsylvania.
   OK, good. If you don't feel just a little silly right now, you
may have what it takes to serve in your state legislature.
   You could have the ability to keep a straight face while
proposing laws to ban toad licking, soothe nervous chickens, pay
people to vote, keep cheerleaders off steroids, exempt ostrich
steaks from sales tax, bring back the whipping post and castrate
sex offenders.
   Or, perhaps, to give your state its own official State Insect,
State Marmot or State Soil.
   Every one of the above has been introduced in at least one
legislature around the country this year, and that's not all.
   West Virginia legislators are considering a proposal to give
lottery tickets to motorists who use their seat belts. A Tennessee
representative has proposed a measure to encourage people to beat
up flag burners _ he wants to reduce the penalty for assault in
such cases to $1.
   A state senator in New Mexico has proposed creating a new county
_ named after himself.
   You might be tempted to believe that all is not sobriety and
seriousness in America's legislatures. But that would be ignoring
some of the issues facing elected officials.
   It turns out, for instance, that there are people who get their
kicks licking toads. According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, South American cane toads secrete a hallucinogenic
toxin that can get the licker as high as a tree frog.
   Legislators in Georgia and South Carolina have introduced bills
to outlaw the practice.
   ``They say these frogs grow to the size of a dinner plate,''
said a horrified Rep. Pat Harris of South Carolina. ``I don't want
to see somebody walk across the statehouse grounds with a frog on a
leash and pick him up and lick him.''
   And consider the plight of the common chicken.
   One of Harris' colleagues in South Carolina, Rep. Larry Koon,
has introduced a bill making it illegal to fire a gun within 300
yards of a chicken coop.
   The sound of a gunshot, it seems, can cause chickens to lose
their vaunted composure, jump into a pile and suffocate each other.
   ``Last year, one of Mr. Koon's constitutents had chickens in a
house,'' explained Rep. Tom Rhoad. ``Someone had a dove shoot in
the field right next to the chicken house. And the guns fired and
caused the chickens to huddle up in a corner, and the farmer lost
over 1,000 chickens.''
   The potty parity bill in Pennsylvania, and a similar one in
Maryland, are aimed at eliminating a serious, even agonizing social
problem: the long lines that form outside women's restrooms in
stadiums, convention halls and other public places. Simply put, the
proposals require more toilets for women.
   The list of official State Stuff could be expanded this year to
include the official State Marmot of Alaska (the squirrelly
``senior hoary marmot'' at the Anchorage Zoo), the State Insect of
Colorado (the yucca moth), and the official Soils of Kentucky (the
Crider soil series), South Dakota (the Houdek soil series) and
Michigan (the Kalkaska soil series).
   It's getting to be all too much for some legislators, among them
Rep. Bill Lear of Kentucky.
   ``Last week it was the official butterfly,'' he fumed. ``This
week it's the official soil. And if we keep this up somebody will
want a bill for frivolous conduct and that will be for the General
Assembly.''

<HEAD>Mayor Says Bush Should Assure Soviets, East Europe on Unified
Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush should assure the Soviet Union
and other East European countries that they face no risk of
aggression from a reunited Germany, West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper
said Monday.
   ``The main achievement of the Soviet Union in the second world
war was the security of their Western flank,'' Momper told
reporters. ``If they really feel that they have lost this main
achievement of the second world war, I think (Soviet President
Mikhail) Gorbachev would get a blow that he really can't bear in
his own country.''
   Momper was to meet with Bush on Tuesday, two days after the
president met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at Camp David
to coordinate their approach to the reunification of Germany.
   ``There is some concern in the Soviet Union over what might
happen to the Soviet troops and to the security on their Western
flank, and mainly the United States can help to assure the Soviet
Union that there is nothing happening that might hit their security
interests,'' said Momper.
   He said Bush also should reassure Poland, Czechoslovakia and
other Eastern European countries.
   Momper called for East Germany to dismantle its military and for
Britain, France, the Soviet Union and United States to extend their
military control to all of East Germany for a transition period
before complete German unification.
   The four powers, which defeated Nazi Germany in World War II,
have retained occupation rights in Berlin for the 45 years since
the war.
   Soviet troops should remain at reduced levels in East Germany
for an unspecified time to assure Poland and the Soviet Union,
Momper said.

<HEAD>Cambodia Negotiators Consider Plan for U.N. Role</HEAD>

   Negotiations resumed Monday on ending
the decade-old civil war in Cambodia, with Australia's proposal for
an interim U.N. administration the main topic of discussion.
   None of the parties directly involved in the talks registered an
explicit rejection of the United Nations playing a major role until
elections are held, said Ali Alatas, foreign minister of Indonesia.
   Attending the latest talks are representatives of the
Vietnamese-sponsored government of Cambodia; the three guerrilla
factions; Vietnam; Laos; France; Australia; and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, consisting of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   In an address opening the conference, Alatis said there was
broad support for the Australian proposal. He said the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ The United States,
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ had endorsed greater U.N.
participation.
   No quick agreement was expected on the proposal, especially
after reports reached Jakarta that thousands of Vietnamese troops
had secretly returned to Cambodia to support premier Hun Sen's army
against the guerrillas.
   Vietman claimed all its force withdrew in late September after
nearly 11 years of occupation, but guerrilla leaders denied it.
   Three guerrilla groups are in an alliance led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk: the prince's own followers and the People's National
Liberation Front of former Premier Son Sann, both non-Communist,
and the Khmer Rouge, whose brutal regime was ousted by the
Vietnamese invasion of December 1978.
   In Jakarta, Son Sann said of the Vietnamese: ``Everybody knows
they are still in Cambodia, and when Phnom Penh troops fight us in
western Cambodia, there are many Vietnamese troops among them.''
   Khieu Samphan, nominal leader of the Khmer Rouge, said 20,000
Vietnamese troops had slipped back into Cambodia. The Vietnamese
refused to let the United Nations verify their withdrawal in
September.
   ``We have returned (home) and never come back,'' Foreign
Minister Nguyen Co Thach said Monday in Jakarta.
   The latest conference is to run through Wednesday.
   Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the Australian plan for a key
U.N. role was an elaboration of earlier suggestions by Prince
Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, and Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
who heads the House subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs.
   ``Foreign troops must leave Cambodia and not come back; the U.N.
can monitor and verify this,'' Evans said. ``Foreign arms supply
and military assistance has to stop; the U.N. can monitor and
verify this. There has to be a cease-fire and associated measures
so that hostilities do not start again; the U.N. can supervise,
monitor and verify this.''
   China arms the guerrilla coalition and the Soviet Union provides
weapons to Vietnam and the Hun Sen government. The United States
has shipped non-lethal supplies to the guerrillas led by Sihanouk
and Son Sann.
   Evans said the United Nations ``should be involved in the civil
administration of Cambodia in the transitional period leading up to
free and fair elections. ... This central idea has been agreed by
virtually everyone to whom we have spoken. Even that one Cambodian
party which has not accepted it has publicly stated that it has not
rejected it.''
   His reference appeared to be to the Khmer Rouge.
   In addition to U.N. administrators, Evans proposed a Supreme
National Council to be ``the repository of Cambodian national
sovereignty and national unity during the transitional period. .. .
Membership of the Supreme National Council could be made up of
individuals from all the Cambodian parties serving in their
personal capacity as `prominent cambodians.'''
   Other provisions of the Australian proposal would dismantle the
Hun Sen government and declare Cambodia's U.N. seat vacant. It is
held by the guerrilla coalition.
   Rafeeuddin Ahmed, who is representing Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar in Jakarta, said the United Nations ``would be
prepared, in the framework of a comprehensive settlement, to
contribute to the implementation of the agreements reached ... if
that were the wish of all parties directly concerned.''
   ``The secretary-general has stressed, however, that the mandate
which may ultimately be entrusted to the United Nations must be
well defined, realistic and practicable,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas is serving as co-host of the talks
with Alatas. The former colonial power in Cambodia recognizes
neither the Hun Sen government nor the guerrilla alliance.

   A man described as upset over his
pending divorce shot and killed his estranged wife and a neighbor
at a birthday party and wounded three other people, police said.
   Authorities on Monday were seeking Carlos Barreto, 68, for
questioning in Sunday's shootings, said police Sgt. Steve Harrison.
   Barreto's estranged wife, Elaine Renee Barreto, 37, died at the
house where she was giving a party for some friends with February
birthdays, said Lt. Bill Manger.
   Witnesses told police the gunman entered the house quietly at 3
a.m., put a revolver to Ms. Barreto's head and shot her. He then
began shooting at the 15 guests as they sought cover behind
furniture and in other rooms in the house.
   The neighbor who was shot, Shawn Robertson, 30, died at Desert
Hospital, police said.
   Among the three wounded, Robert Coon, 30, was most seriously
injured. He was hospitalized in critical condition, Harrison said.

   The confession was supposed to be
secret, not even admissible in court. But now, people who follow
the news know the name of a 13-year-old who admitted molesting 64
preschoolers.
   The leak of David Hawkey's confession and the resulting
widespread publicity has seriously jeopardized his treatment, say
counselors at the youth home where he is undergoing court-ordered
therapy.
   The boy now trusts no one and, because of fear of harassment,
has been removed from the public school he was attending under
supervision. Social workers say they don't know where he can be
helped without being followed by the stigma of what he admitted.
   ``The question becomes, where can this child go now to get
treatment? Are we going to have to send him out of state?'' asked
Glenn DeMots, associate executive director of Bethany Christian
Services in Grand Rapids.
   The boy from Fruitport, a mostly rural community of 1,100
residents about 30 miles northwest of Grand Rapids, has been at
Bethany since last summer after pleading guilty to second-degree
criminal sexual conduct for molesting one child while baby-sitting
during services at Fruitport Bethel Baptist Church.
   As part of his treatment, he was urged to disclose the names of
any other victims. He admitted molesting 63 otherchildren between
ages 1{ to 4 years old during 1985-88.
   He also implicated his 17-year-old brother, Paul, who was
charged with one count of first-degree criminal sexual conduct.
Paul denies the charge.
   David was told beforehand that any disclosures he made would be
given to his case worker and police to ensure treatment for the
alleged victims. But otherwise, the confession from patient to
therapist is confidential.
   But during the notification of congregation members, the
confession became public. The story was first published,
identifying the Hawkey boys, in The Muskegon Chronicle on Feb. 4.
   It wasn't long before the story was picked up nationally. David
has been labeled as potentially one of the worst child molesters in
U.S. history.
   Since the story broke, Muskegon County Prosecutor Tony Tague has
filed two additional charges of first-degree criminal sexual
conduct against David and said he expects more charges.
   ``I wouldn't feel comfortable just taking his word for (the
number of victims), so we're trying to verify as many cases as we
can,'' Tague said, adding that detectives were still interviewing
many of the children.
   Tague said he would like to see David incarcerated until his
19th birthday, the maximum penalty because of his age at the time
of the alleged crimes.
   Media representatives have said the seriousness of the alleged
abuse made identification of the boys inevitable.
   ``If we didn't name them, every person in Fruitport with a
13-year-old neighbor is going to be looking sideways at him,'' said
Chronicle Editor Gunnar Carlson.
   ``On the other hand, there were dozens and dozens of people who
already knew precisely who was involved, so it certainly didn't
come as any surprise to the congregation or to the extended
family.''
   David's attorney, Gerald Gibbs, said he is worried the publicity
has tainted the case.
   ``I don't know what his chances are with all the publicity,''
Gibbs said. ``It's too early to know how seriously it's disrupted
his treatment, but he already has a serious distrust of the system
from all of this.''
   The pastor of the church said the publicity has drawn his
congregation together.
   ``I don't think the names should have been used ... but in some
cases, it's been helpful for the victims and their parents to see
the reports so they know (the boy) is being held and doesn't have
access to them,'' the Rev. Billie Anderson said.
   Bethany officials fear the publicity and the prosecutor's
aggressiveness may deter other young offenders from disclosing
their crimes.
   ``Disclosure is the key to treatment,'' clinical supervisor
Cindy Lindstrom said. ``This has created a lot of questions for the
kids about what they should and shouldn't say. ... I'm very
concerned how it could affect the rest of the program.''

   Jesse L. Jackson said today he will not run
for mayor of the nation's capital in this fall's election.
   ``I want to continue to serve, but not as mayor,'' the civil
rights leader and two-time Democratic presidential candidate said
in a statement prepared for a news conference.
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of conjecture
since he moved to Washington in April 1989. The speculation
intensified with Mayor Marion Barry's arrest last month on a
cocaine possession charge.
   In his statement, Jackson did not address whether he would again
seek the White House in 1992.
   He said he plans to continue working to end the city's drug and
crime crisis and to push for statehood for the District of Columbia.
   ``At present I believe that I may best serve by continuing my
work on a national level to change the direction of this country. I
want to serve, but not as mayor,'' Jackson said.
   ``Because this is an election year, the mayor's issue has grown
with the crisis in the city and the tribulations of the mayor,''
Jackson said in his statement.
   In recent weeks, Jackson has stressed repeatedly that
championing the city's quest to become the nation's 51st state
would remain his priority through the election year.
   Barry is in a South Carolina hospital for treatment for what an
aide has called an alcohol problem. City Administrator Carol
Thompson is in charge of the city in Barry's absence.
   Jackson's decision comes amid growing signs that voters _ and
politicians _ are wary of a Jackson mayoral bid.
   A Washington Post poll released Thursday said Jackson would
trail Barry if both were candidates in the September Democratic
primary.
   The poll of 800 registered Democrats in the district found Barry
was preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed, while 19 percent
said they would vote for Jackson. Four other possible candidates
split 33 percent of those polled, while the remaining 9 percent
were listed as undecided, wouldn't vote or other.
   If Barry were not in the race, Jackson would receive support
from 26 percent of those questioned, compared with 19 percent for
city Councilman John Ray. The poll had a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
   In the past, Jackson refused repeatedly to rule out a run for
Barry's job, saying he only would seek the office if Barry, a
longtime colleague, did not run for a fourth term.
   Since his arrest, Barry has been silent on his plans for
re-election. Mayoral aides have said Barry acknowledged privately
the weekend after his arrest that he would not run again.
   The prospects for a Jackson candidacy had encountered other
turbulence.
   Last fall, the city council passed a bill sponsored by two
announced mayoral candidates that limits outside income from
honoraria and speeches for the mayor to $10,000 per year.
   Jackson has said he earns about $200,000 a year, mostly from
speeches and honoraria. The mayor's job pays $89,500 a year.
   In addition to Ray, there are three announced Democratic
candidates for mayor and one Republican.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro defeated President Daniel Ortega in a stunning rebuke to
10 years of leftist Sandinista rule in this war-weary nation,
election returns showed today.
   Sunday's peaceful balloting _ the freest elections in Nicaraguan
history _ was closely watched by thousands of international
observers and, with more than three-fourths of the vote in, Mrs.
Chamorro was winning just over 55 percent.
   Earlier, with more than half the results in, Ortega stopped
short of formally conceding but said in a television appearance:
``These numbers and these percentages form a tendency that cannot
be ignored.''
   He said the precincts that had not yet reported held 50 percent
of the vote, but admitted a Sandinista victory would ``break
mathematical rules.''
   ``I want to tell all Nicaraguans and all the nations of the
world, that the president of Nicaragua, and the government, will
respect and accept the popular mandate,'' Ortega added.
   The Sandinistas remain by far the largest single party _ the
United Nationalist Opposition Mrs. Chamorro heads is a fractious
alliance of 14 parties ranging from far right to far left _ and it
was unclear how power would be transferred.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, has
said that if Mrs. Chamorro won, ``she would still have to deal with
me,'' and that the army might disobey orders it considered unsound.
   Whether he commands that kind of loyalty remains to be seen. UNO
has said it will eliminate the draft and greatly reduce the size of
the army, the largest in Central America.
   Another question is how UNO, whose members' only common interest
was getting rid of the Sandinistas, could form a government strong
enough to stand up to the Sandinista bureaucracy.
   Ortega, 44, had branded Mrs. Chamorro, the 60-year-old publisher
of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, an instrument of U.S. policy
and had hoped to capitalize on Nicaraguan pride at standing up to
the colossus of the North.
   But the voters rejected Ortega's one-party rule, which led to
economic decline that the Sandinistas blamed on the U.S.-supported
Contra insurgency and a U.S. trade embargo.
   Under the Sandinistas, Nicaragua became a self-proclaimed
revolutionary state and adopted portions of Marxist and Leninist
ideology to remake its economic and social structures. It won
strong support from the Soviet Union and Cuba, and was accused by
the United States of trying to foment Communist revolution in
neighboring El Salvador.
   The Sandinist loss to the UNO, which says it favors
Western-style representative government, followed by just a few
months the restoration of democracy in a series of Soviet-aligned
nations in East Europe and moves toward democratization in the
Soviet Union itself.
   ``The Nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in
democracy, in peace and in freedom,'' Mrs. Chamorro told more than
1,000 cheering supporters. If her victory is confirmed, she will
take office on April 25.
   In Washington, President Bush hailed the upset victory in
Nicaragua as ``another victory'' for democracy in a remarkable
year. His spokesman said a lifting of economic sanctions would be a
``first consideration.''
   He said he spoke with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez
about ``appropriate trade and economic measures that we can take to
support the new government of Nicaragua.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the international
community would insist ``full civil and military power be
transferred to the newly elected government.''
   Honduras said Chamorro's victory would pave the way for improved
relations with its neighbor. The countries have quarreled over
U.S.-backed Contra rebel bases in Honduras.
   The Supreme Electoral Council said that with 77.7 percent of
precincts counted, Mrs. Chamorro had 618,699 votes, or 55.2
percent, to Ortega's 457,870 or 40.9 percent. Eight other parties
split what little remained.
   Ortega's speech was filled with sadness and seemed at times
almost like a valedictory, tracing the course of the Sandinista
party from the time it led the revolution that toppled President
Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   ``Just as we managed to defeat Somocismo, so we also managed to
defeat the counterrevolution and to indict before the world those
who launched a policy of death against the people of Nicaragua,''
he said, referring to the United States.
   ``We were sure that this electoral process would bring all
Nicaraguans that peace and stability we need so much,'' Ortega said.
   At times Ortega looked pained and it seemed as if he simply
could not bring himself to say flatly that the party had lost.
   Flanked by top aides and his common-law wife, who looked pale
and shaken, Ortega told Nicaraguans he was proud, in any case, that
the Sandinistas had brought a democratic election to Nicaragua.
   Aristides Sanchez, a Contra leader, called the election result
``a triumph of the people.
   ``All Nicaraguans must now back the new government and attempt
to achieve a national reconciliation,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Miami.
   The United States ended military aid to the Contras in February
1988, but, at Bush's urging, Congress has continued to supply the
ontras with non-lethal aid to pressure the Sandinistas into holding
free elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro was asked as she left her house for campaign
headquarters if she thought a transfer of power after 10{ years of
Sandinista rule would be smooth. ``That's the commitment. We want
peace and reconciliation.''
   As they battled the Contra rebels, the Sandinistas muzzled
dissent for years. Most pre-election polls said Mrs. Chamorro was
trailing Ortega, but many Nicaraguans were afraid to reveal their
true feelings outside a truly secret ballot box.
   Under the Sandinistas, the centrally planned economy was wracked
by inflation and mismanagement.
   Celebrations began breaking out in various neighborhoods of
Managua before dawn, with people burning some of the thousands of
Sandinista banners draped across city streets. However, the
celebrations appeared to die down quickly.
   A midnight celebration at Sandinista headquarters had been
canceled.
   Turnout was heavy in what was considered Nicaragua's freest vote
ever, with people lining up for as much as four hours to cast
ballots and more than 3,000 international observers monitoring the
peaceful election.
   Voters also selected 90 National Assembly members and
representatives to 146 regional, city and town councils.
   The electoral council was extremely late in reporting votes, and
opposition officials initially said they believed the council
hadn't expected a Sandinista loss and was withholding announcement
because it didn't know what to do.
   After the polls closed, former President Jimmy Carter, head of
one observer group, called the ballot ``very fair.'' About 1.75
million of Nicaragua's 3.5 million people were registered to vote.
   A festive mood prevailed at the headquarters of Mrs. Chamorro
early today, while at the Sandinista party headquarters the mood
was funereal, with long faces and few smiles.
   Mrs. Chamorro favors market-oriented reform, but the Sandinistas
recently softened their socialist line, promising a mixed economy
and saying they would no longer expropriate private property. They
also released political prisoners.
   Inflation, which ran 1,700 percent last year, and the draft were
on the minds of many voters. Barely a Nicaraguan family has escaped
losing a member to the war with the Contras, which has claimed
30,000 lives.

   Perrier said Monday the recall of the 160 million
bottles of sparkling water it had on the market around the world
was more than 90 percent complete.
   Withdrawing of Perrier's familiar green bottles began Feb. 14
when the water was found to contain the chemical benzene.
   The company said a redistribution plan is being developed and

   The recall was estimated to put a $35 million dent in Perrier's

   Perrier said the problem that prompted the recall had been
isolated at the gas filtration level of production.
   ``New procedures have been put in place to assure quality

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens
arrived Monday for a four-day visit during which full diplomatic
relations with Poland are to be restored after a 23-year break.
   Arens meets Tuesday with his Polish counterpart, Foreign
Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, to sign the protocol establishing
the ties broken by Poland after the 1967 Middle East War.
   He also has appointments Tuesday with Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki and President Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   The foreign minister's first day was spent in emotional visits
to memorials to Poland's once-vibrant Jewish community, reduced to
a few thousand from 3.5 million before World War II.
   ``Every Jew who comes to Poland must remember the tragedy of the
Holocaust that the Jewish nation went through on this land,'' Arens
said, the official PAP news agency reported.
   He paid homage at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising of
1943, when Jews, held in a walled-in section of the city to face
starvation or deportation, rose up against the Nazi occupiers.
   Arens stood in silence at the monument at Umschlagplatz, the
depot where 300,000 Warsaw Jews were loaded on trains to the Nazi
concentration camps. He went to the Jewish Cemetery, where acres of
overgrown graves testify to the obliteration of later generations.
   He laid a wreath at the Polish Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and
visited the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in southeastern
Poland.
   Arens on Wednesday will go to the Auschwitz death camp in
southern Poland, where the presence of a Roman Catholic convent in
a former Nazi warehouse strained Jewish-Polish relations and
stirred international controversy.
   Construction of an interfaith prayer center to house the nuns
farther from the camp began last week, a year after the passing of
the deadline for moving the convent set in an accord reached by
Jewish and Catholic leaders in Geneva.
   Polish press coverage of the Arens visit has focused on the
Solidarity-led government's position acknowledging the error of the
decision to sever ties and the act's consequences, including an
anti-Semitic purge in 1968.
   ``Poland Apologizes to Israel'' and ``Return to Normalcy'' were
among the newspaper headlines Monday. The daily Zycie Warszawy said
the breaking of ties ``could have looked spectacular then, and
could even seem justified, but in fact it brought about more losses
than profits.''
   Poland, with the rest of the Warsaw Pact except Romania, cut
relations with Israel after the 1967 war. Hungary in September
became the first nation to restore ties, and Czechoslovakia was the
second on Feb. 9.
   From 350,000 to 500,000 Israelis were born in Poland, the
newspaper noted, including the first Israeli prime minister, David
Ben Ben Gurion, and the present one, Yitzhak Shamir.
   Polish-Israeli relations have steadily improved since 1986, when
each country established an interest section in the other's capital.
   Poland's new government, however, also has sought to establish
even-handed relations with Arab states and has not changed its
position in support of the Palestinian nation's right to a homeland.
   Arens is accompanied by a delegation of business leaders and has
talks scheduled with Polish Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowic, who
drafted Poland's radical shift toward a market-driven economy.
   Poland is seeking Western investment and officials have said
they hope the improved relations will increase Polish-Israeli
trade, estimated at $60 million last year.

   The nation's top business economists believe
the economy will avoid a recession for the next three years and
break the record expansion set in the ``glory days'' of the 1960s,
according to a survey released on Monday.
   But the poll by the National Association of Business Economists
indicated the economy is in a ``danger zone'' and is likely to grow
only a sluggish 1.7 percent this year before accelerating to a 2.5
percent rate next year.
   The 65 professional forecasters also saw little sign of
significant progress over the next two years in achieving the zero
inflation goal set by the Federal Reserve.
   In fact, they predicted prices would rise 4.2 percent both this
year and next, down slightly from 1989's 4.6 percent rate. The rate
was 4.4 percent in both 1987 and 1988.
   Nevertheless, the survey showed that 60.6 percent believe the
economy will avoid a recession through 1993, statistically
unchanged from a 62.1 percent finding late last year.
   James F. Smith, the association's president and finance
professor at the University of North Carolina, said the biggest
news in the survey is its confirmation of the ``sea-change'' of
optimism found among participants in December. A survey last May
found 63 percent of the economists expecting a recession this year.
   Still, nearly 46.2 percent in the latest survey said the risk of
an economic downturn increased in the fourth quarter of 1989. Of
the 39.4 percent who thought a recession would occur in the next
three years, 18.1 percent believe it started in the last quarter or
will begin sometime this year.
   A survey summary contended ``the economy is in a danger zone.''
It said ``the probability of recession is not trivial and almost 80
percent of respondents think it has risen or remained the same over
the last quarter,''
   Only 21.5 percent said they believe the recession risk has
decreased.
   ``We all know we have not repealed the business cycle; there
will be a recession some day,'' Smith said . ``But our members are
confident ... that we will shatter all records for the U.S. economy
with the current expansion (now in its eighth year).
   ``When we get to October 1991, we will tie the glory days of the
1960s and break the 1961-1969 expansion,'' he said.
   Smith credited Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other members of
the Federal Open Market Committee for the ``relatively confident
outlook.''
   ``In our latest policy survey, an astounding 72 percent of the
nearly 300 respondents said what the Fed was doing was about
right,'' Smith said. ``Now anything that gets almost three out of
four economists to agree with it must be either tremendously good
or tremendously bad. In this case, we would assume tremendously
good.''
   The FOMC, comprised of the Fed governors and district
presidents, sets monetary policy and for more than a year has been
trying to drive down inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit.
   The Bush administration and many economists have urged the Fed
to ease credit and thus permit lower interest rates in an attempt
to stimulate the economy, which slowed from a 3 percent growth rate
in the third quarter to 0.5 percent in the fourth.
   However, Greenspan indicated to Congress last week the central
bank would keep interest rates high. And in their survey, the NABE
economists expect little movement in interest rates over 1990-1991.

<HEAD>Experts Testify In Finale of Hazelwood Prosecution Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The giant hull of the Exxon Valdez was
gashed twice as the tanker lumbered over one set of jagged rocks
and grounded on another on Bligh Reef, a witness testified today.
   George Greiner Jr., formerly of the Coast Guard, showed jurors
elaborate sets of charts, graphs and photographs of the ship in dry
dock in San Diego.
   Greiner said he tracked the ship's course from a number of logs
kept by the crew and found that its damage was intensified by the
dramatic shifting of tides in Prince William Sound as the 987-foot
tanker sat grounded on the reef.
   He said the rising tide ``caused a crushing effect,'' adding to
the damage.
   Greiner testified as the trial of Joseph Hazelwood entered its
fourth week with prosecutors planning to rest their case against
the skipper Tuesday.
   The prosecution claims that Hazelwood, skipper of the crippled
ship, was reckless in trying to drive it off the reef after the
March 24 accident.
   Hazelwood's lawyers contend he never attempted the risky
maneuver of backing off the reef but was trying to stabilize the
vessel by moving forward.
   Prosecutors say that if Hazelwood had succeeded in moving it off
the reef, the Exxon Valdez would have capsized, spilling even more
oil and possibly killing crew members.
   The tanker spilled almost 11 million gallons of oil, killing
countless birds, fish and other wildlife and blackening hundreds of
miles of rocky shore.
   In addition to Greiner, prosecutors plan to call experts to
testify about the effects of alcohol on the body and the figures
reflected on blood-alcohol tests administered to Hazelwood after
the accident.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y. is charged with second degree
criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors: reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. If convicted on all counts he could face a
maximim of 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the tanker grounded during
a tricky passage into scenic Prince William Sound. A third mate who
was in charge has blamed the accident on the helmsman's failure to
steer properly.
   A key issue in the case is whether Hazelwood was drunk when he
boarded the ship. He had spent a day in the port city of Valdez and
was seen by witnesses drinking at a bar called the Pipeline Club.
   But in his first post-accident interview with the Coast Guard,
played for jurors on Friday, Hazelwood denied drinking anything
stronger than beer and said he drank nothing at all at the Pipeline
Club.

<HEAD>Christian Forces Skirmish, Deadlocking Mediation Efforts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian forces skirmished in east
Beirut on Monday, deadlocking mediation efforts to end the power
struggle between rival Christian leaders and sending hundreds of
frightened civilians fleeing.
   Two people died and 10 were wounded in the daylong exchanges of
sniper fire, police said.
   That raised the casualty toll to 693 killed and 1,925 wounded
since fighting broke out on Jan 30 between the Lebanese Forces led
by Samir Geagea and the army troops of Gen. Michel Aoun. It is the
worst fighting between Christian factions in the nearly 15-year-old
civil war.
   A three-man mediation committee of independent Christian leaders
was unable to stop the shooting and faced ``major difficulties'' in
arranging an overall settlement, a police spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   ``The snipers didn't stop shooting although the committee
members were repeatedly informed by the two headquarters that
orders had been issued to halt the exchanges,'' the spokesman said.
   The committee's failure to stabilize a repeatedly violated Feb.
17 cease-fire heightened concern that a new round of fighting is
likely between the factions vying for control of the Christian
enclave north of Beirut.
   The spokesman said the committee ``couldn't proceed with its
plan to reopen roads'' inside Christian east Beirut because of the
clashes.
   The committee arranged for some main roads to reopen Sunday, but
so far that has been all the mediators have achieved.
   The mediation deadlock drove hundreds of Christian civilians to
cross Beirut's dividing Green Line into Moslem west Beirut and flee
to eastern and northern Lebanon.
   The police spokesman said there was a sharp increase in the
number of evacuees in the afternoon, after radio stations reported
the committee was making no progress in ending the bloodshed.
   At least 110,000 civilians have fled the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave since Jan. 30, 35,000 of them since the fragile
cease-fire began.
   Lebanon's national carrier, Middle East Airlines, has scheduled
eight extra flights a week to Cyprus for the fleeing Christians. It
normally flies to Larnaca, on the east Mediterranean island's south
coast, four times a week.
   Christian sources said on condition of anonymity the committee
could not get Aoun and Geagea to agree on its plan to stabilize the
cease-fire.
   One source close to the mediators said Geagea's command proposed
a ``disengagement of forces as a necessary step to normalize the
situation before continuing with the plan to reopen roads.''
   Geagea, the source said, ``believes that reopening roads without
separating the forces will only jeopardize civilians who might get
caught in the cross fire of any renewed fighting.''
   The source said Aoun ``rejected the disengagement proposal and
wanted a political agreement reached with the Lebanese Forces
before the committee continues with its plan for reopening roads.''
   Stabilizing the cease-fire without a political agreement would
undercut Aoun's declared objective that the Lebanese Forces should
disband and become a political organization. Geagea refuses to
break up his military force.
   Geagea's fighters control two-thirds of the Christian enclave,
including its three main ports and two isolated pockets on the
northwestern edge of Beirut.
   Aoun's army holds Beirut's southeastern districts, eastern
suburbs and the Metn mountains to the northeast.
   Shaker Abu Suleiman, a member of the committee, said the
mediators are ``the thin thread'' that is preventing a new
conflagration.
   ``We'll maintain our mission regardless of the difficulties
because we do not want the population partitioned,'' he said.
   The leftist As-Safir daily, based in west Beirut, said Geagea
has signed a ``written pledge'' to accept the authority of
Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi in east Beirut if Hrawi's
government intervenes to halt the Christian feuding.
   Hrawi, elected Nov. 24, is recognized by Geagea, but rejected by
Aoun, who considers himself the sole legitimate authority in
Lebanon. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Aoun considers them an occupation
army.
   In September 1988, Aoun, the army commander, was appointed head
of an interim military Cabinet by outgoing President Amin Gemayel
after parliament failed to elect a successor.
   When he took office, Hrawi fired Aoun as army chief and
caretaker premier, but the general refused to step down, alleging
Hrawi's election was unconstitutional.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronite Catholics, the main
Christian sect that has dominated Lebanon since independence from
France in 1943.

<DATELINE>FRENSTAT, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brass band struck up the
``Internationale'' on Monday as the Red Army began leaving
Czechoslovakia 22 years after it arrived to crush a reform movement.
   Karel Micek of the Civic Forum said the presence of Soviet
troops had meant ``empty shelves in stores, polluted water, an
occasional fight in the pub and a reminder that we are not a free
country.''
   ``Their main problem was that they were here,'' said Micek,
whose group played a central role in the peaceful revolution that
ousted the Communist Party from exclusive power in November.
   Twenty-two Soviet T-62 tanks loaded on flatcars left the
northern town of Frenstat, beginning a negotiated, three-stage
pullout of the 73,500 Soviet military personnel, scheduled for
completion next year.
   A second train, laden with 33 armored vehicles, left a few hours
later from the Domasov nad Bystrici station near a Red Army base at
Libava in eastern Czechoslovakia.
   It is the first time the Kremlin has removed its soldiers from
the territory of a Warsaw Pact ally.
   Hungary is near agreement with the Soviets on a similar accord,
but no deals have been struck with Poland and East Germany, the
other Soviet allies in Europe that are hosts to Red Army troops.
   Soviet soldiers remained in Czechoslovakia after a Warsaw Pact
invasion crushed the reformist ``Prague Spring'' of 1968. They
entered Hungary in 1956 to put down an anti-Stalinist uprising.
   Before the withdrawal began, the Soviet Union had 1,220 tanks,
2,5O5 armored vehicles, 77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters in
Czechoslovakia, in addition to the 73,500 soldiers.
   Soon after the first train rolled toward the border, the
official news agency CTK reported that Soviet-Czechoslovak military
maneuvers would be held next month.
   ``The Czechoslovak People's Army and the Central Group of Troops
of the Soviet Army will be held'' March 1-4 in western and northern
Bohemia March 1-4, it said, quoting the Defense Ministry.
   It was not clear whether the announcement's timing was a
coincidence or meant as a signal that Czechoslovakia remains a
dependable Soviet ally despite the withdrawal and a government
dominated by non-Communists.
   Another CTK dispatch quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Evzen Vacek
as telling a parliamentary committee the pullout would be completed
by June 30, 1991. No specific date had been mentioned previously.
   Ceremonies at Frenstat were simple and brief. The departure from
the base 110 miles southeast of Prague is to be completed March 13
and Red Army troops are to be gone from Libava, 180 miles east of
the capital, by March 25.
   The withdrawal agreement was initialed Feb. 22 in Prague and is
to be signed in Moscow this week by Presidents Vaclav Havel and
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Havel flew to the Soviet capital Monday, three days after
returning from the United States and talks with President Bush.
   Under the withdrawal agreement, a ``decisive part'' of the
Soviet force is to be out by the end of May, a month before the
first free elections in Czechoslovakia since the Communists
consolidated power in 1948.
   ``This is our new peace policy in practice ... a retreat from
the policy of confrontation,'' Gen. Vladimir Malyshkievich, deputy
chief of Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia, said during the Frenstat
ceremonies. ``It is only proper this process starts in the center
of Europe and on the day of the official visit of President Havel
in the Soviet Union.''
   No official figures have been released on how many soldiers left
Monday. Vadim Pliska, a Soviet trooper at Frenstat, said 2,000
soldiers and about 90 tanks were stationed there.

<HEAD>Despite Million-Dollar Homes, Island Market Not What it Used to Be</HEAD>

   The slumping New England economy is
taking its toll even on this exclusive little island, where
corporate officers, rock stars, politicians and stockbrokers
retreat for the summer.
   The $4 million beachfront cottages are still being snapped up,
but economic and oceanic tides have washed away prospects for fast
bucks from quickie developments. This pleases Nantucket's
year-round residents, who say all the new construction threatens
the island's natural charm.
   ``Developers aren't welcome here,'' Nantucket real estate agent
David Webster said flatly.
   Speculation builders came to the island from the mid-1970s to
mid-1980s, when New England banks were making jumbo loans for
developers, who then bought land and built and built. They turned
miles of the island's moors and golden heathlands into subdivisions
with asphalt streets and green lawns.
   The real estate market already was pricy. In Nantucket's
historic downtown, colonial homes from the 17th century regularly
sold for millions of dollars, and prices escalated for properties
along the ocean.
   ``You take a house that runs $700,000 inland here,'' Webster
said. ``If it's within sight of water the price can go to $1.5
million. If it's on the beach, it's up to $3 million.''
   About 600 new housing units a year were built on Nantucket's
30,000 acres during the peak years of the mid-1980s, Webster says.
Now, he adds, about half that number are built each year.
   ``When I was a kid it used to be beautiful out here,'' Webster
said, driving through an area dotted with new two-bedroom
developments. ``There even used to be sheep grazing out here.''
   The sheep are gone, but now, so are the developers. When the
stock market crashed in 1987, the bottom started to fall out of the
New England real estate market.
   Some developers were stuck with high-priced mortgages on lots
and buildings.
   Webster mentions one who is taking a bath after building a
100-room motel that has no renters.
   ``They're paying $100,000 a month on the mortgage,'' Webster
said. ``They can't pay it back. And what does the bank do? They
don't want it.''
   What economics haven't accomplished, nature has. Erosion on the
island's windy southern and eastern coasts is eating away at
beachfront lots holding houses that once sold for millions.
   ``On the south side of the island, beachfront properties are
going for $300,000 that would go for $1.2 million on the north
side,'' Webster said. ``People simply aren't building on the south
side of the island anymore.''
   Such developments please islanders, who have established
commissions to preserve the island's historic downtown and the
countryside.
   A land bank levies a 2 percent fee against all real estate
transactions. The money is used to buy and administer land to be
preserved.
   ``There was a feeling that if the people didn't do something,
the land wouldn't be saved,'' said Dawn Darbey, director of the
land bank.

   New Grammy award winners with New Orleans
roots met Monday for an extra awards ceremony at City Hall and said
the world is finally waking up to the New Orleans sound.
   ``I don't think we're doing anything differently. I think the
world is just catching up to us,'' said Mac Rebennack, better known
as Dr. John, who won a Grammy last week with Rickie Lee Jones for a
jazz duet version of ``Makin' Whoopee.''
   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy recognized the prize-winning artists
with certificates of merit.
   Three of the Neville Brothers, winners for best pop instrumental
with the song ``Healing Chant,'' also were on hand.
   Art Neville said national and world recognition of New Orleans
music, with its jazz, Caribbean and African influences, was long
overdue.
   Charles Neville said last week's four Grammy awards for New
Orleans recording acts are bound to help the city's musicians.
   ``I think the big thing it did though, was give more credibility
to New Orleans music,'' he said. ``We'll probably get regular air
play now. Before this, programmers said New Orleans music was too
regional. Well, it's true it is regional. But the region is the
world.''
   Aaron Neville, who also won a separate Grammy for a duet with
Linda Ronstadt, said he's still not over Grammy night. ``I was
excited and nervous the night of the awards. I'm just excited
now,'' he said.

<HEAD>Anglo-Irish Parliamentary Body: A Coming Together of Old Foes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was hardly the fall of the Berlin Wall, but the
ceremony Monday in the House of Commons also was historic: It
brought Irish and British lawmakers together as a joint
parliamentary body for the first time in nearly 70 years.
   In the Jubilee Room of the cavernous House of Commons, champagne
glasses clinked in jovial harmony and Irish and British voices once
again discussed the question that has vexed the two island nations
for centuries: how to understand each other.
   ``Our two people have an infinite capacity for mutual
misunderstanding,'' former Irish Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald
said in an interview, ``and the opportunity to sit down and talk to
each other, know each other, understand how each other's minds work
and dissipate some of the prejudices by undermining them, I think
is very important.''
   The British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body has no legislative
powers, and the job of its 25 Irish and 25 British members will be
limited almost entirely to talk.
   But it is the first forum of its kind since Ireland became
independent in 1922 with its own parliament, the Dail, and it comes
at a time when cautious hopes are being voiced about settling the
Northern Ireland conflict.
   Peter Brooke, Britain's top official in Northern Ireland, has
been talking about new possibilities of bringing feuding Protestant
and Catholic leaders together; Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey
is to pay a rare visit to Belfast in April; and increasingly,
Northern Irelanders are asking what 20 years of bloodshed and
nearly 3,000 deaths have accomplished.
   ``There is movement at the moment. It's slight, I don't want to
raise expectations, but I do believe it's real,'' said Irish Deputy
Prime Minister Brian Lenihan, who will co-chair the new body with
his British counterpart, Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   The reason, Lenihan told BBC Radio, is that the unionists,
Northern Ireland's Protestant majority, are discovering that their
refusal to negotiate with the Catholic nationalist minority is
getting them nowhere.
   ``The unionists now see that the world is passing them by.
Recent events in Europe ... mean that Northern Ireland more and
more is becoming a backwater,'' said Lenihan.
   The unionists were offered two seats on the Inter-Parliamentary
Body, but turned them down. They see it as a byproduct of the 1985
Anglo-Irish Agreement, which they believe undermines their union
with Britain by giving the Irish government a say in the running of
British-ruled Northern Ireland.
   Their boycott represents a reversal of history, for once it was
the Irish nationalists who refused to have any dealings with
London. As far back as 1843, Daniel O'Connell, the great Irish
nationalist, warned his people never ``to expect anything except
injustice from an English Parliament.''
   Those suspicions linger. ``On the British side there's an
insensitivity and on the Irish side there's a certain
prickliness,'' said Austin Currie, a Northern Ireland Catholic who
is a member of the Irish Dail and belongs to the new body. ``And if
we recognize the insensitivity and the prickliness, that's the way
to make progress.''
   ``It's historic. There is no way that 20 or 15 years ago any
group of Irish parliamentarians could have come here in the way
that they have today,'' said Merlyn Rees, a former Northern Ireland
secretary and now an opposition Labor Party lawmaker.
   He pointed to the staircase leading to the room where the
inaugural cocktail party was going on and said, ``Where we're
standing now there was an IRA bomb in 1974.''
   FitzGerald argued it was the Irish Republican Army, through its
bombing and shooting campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British
rule, which was chiefly responsible for creating the
Inter-Parliamentary Body.
   The IRA was as hostile to the Irish government as to the
British, he said in an interview, and this had forced Dublin into
coordinating strategy more closely with London.
   ``The actions of the IRA have so polarized opinion that the
center of gravity of the Irish approach has come closer to that of
the British,'' he said. ``It's the one positive contribution the
IRA have ever made.''
   The IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, issued a statement hoping
that members of the new body would ``press for an end to partition
and the right of the Irish people to self-determination.''

<HEAD>Army Shows Dismantling of Secret Police Phone-Tapping Center</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military officers showed Monday how
they had begun dismantling the telephone-tapping centers of Nicolae
Ceausescu's secret police and said their work was proof the
widespread eavesdropping was ended.
   ``Observe please that all the power boxes have been removed,''
said Maj. Gen. Nicolae Cerbu, deputy of the army Signal Corps,
gesturing at a bank of cassette players in a listening center in
Bucharest.
   Ceausescu's dreaded secret police, the Securitate, tapped tens
of thousands of telephones as part of its vast domestic spying
apparatus. The Securitate was officially disbanded after the
December revolution that ended the Communist dictator's 24-year
reign and led to his execution.
   The military organized a tour of the listening centers for
reporters in an apparent effort to counter widespread criticism
that authorities had done too little to dismantle the Securitate
structures.
   ``This is the proof that it (bugging) doesn't happen now,'' said
Col. Mihai Alexuta, another Signal Corps officer.
   Military officers said that in Bucharest, the Securitate
maintained interception equipment at all 30 telephone exchanges, as
well as in factories, hotels and military offices. The signals were
sent to two secret recording studios where the conversations were
monitored and transcribed, they said.
   ``The first people to be targeted with these listening devices
were (in) the army,'' said Cerbu, who added that people generally
were repulsed by this kind of activity.''
   The officers said they believed they had found all the bugging
centers in Romania but they declined to say how many there were.
All the eavesdropping had been stopped, they said.
   The equipment will be dismantled and the parts inventoried and
then given to different ministries or military departments for
their use, Cerbu said.
   ``It's a pity to destroy these things, because they are
expensive,'' he said. ``An amplifier could be well used in a small
village where a ministry wants to set up telephones for people who
don't have them.''
   In one of the interception centers, a room about the size of a
large broom closet located in a central telephone exchange, the
officers opened a few of 48 small gray drawers set into a metal
frame. Inside were circuit boards covered with transistors.
   The equipment was capable of intercepting 36 telephone calls at
one time, and could be used for 18,000 different phones, Cerbu said.
   In a nearby concrete building with bars on the windows, which
the officers said was a former Securitate headquarters, reporters
were led up a narrow staircase to rooms filled with a series of
cabinets, each containing 12 small built-in cassette players. In
front were desks with switchboards.
   In one room were desks topped with gray metal transcription
machines attached to sets of headphones. The fuses had been cut and
some of the equipment was dismantled.
   The officers said different departments of the Securitate
ordered the centers to monitor individuals, then requested the
tapes or manuscripts.
   None of the cassettes had been found, the officers said. They
said they did not know why.
   Cerbu said authorities had begun cutting power to the devices
from the start of the revolution, ``because we knew that with them,
the orders of commanders of troops in the revolution could be
overheard.''
   The armed forces sided with popular demonstrators to oust
Ceausescu.
   The military knew some of the listening rooms existed, and
technical staff at some of the centers alerted them to others, he
said.
   The fate of the Securitate is one of the most hotly discussed
issues in Romania. Only a handful of the 15,000 full-time officers
of the secret police have been put on trial, and officials provided
few details on the dismantling of the security force in the first
two months after the revolution.
   In recent days, however, the Defense Ministry has said more than
3,500 senior members of the force have been dismissed, and
state-run TV has shown eavesdropping centers in various cities.

<HEAD>Florida School Accused of Boosting Income From Student Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private Florida school whose two owners paid
themselves $12 million over four years was accused Monday of
doctoring documents in order to boost income from federal
guaranteed student loans.
   The staff of the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee
found evidence suggesting ``intentional abuse of the guaranteed
student loan system'' by American Career Training School, said
Chief Investigator David B. Buckley.
   Joseph A. Calareso, president of ACTS, located in Pompano Beach,
Fla., was subpoenaed to testify before the subcommittee but refused
to answer all but preliminary questions on grounds of possible
self-incrimination.
   Investigators said the school was targeted only because it had a
substantial number of student loans.
   ``I'm afraid they are just scratching the surface'' of a
mountain of problems in the aid programs, said Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Buckley and investigator Grace T. McPhearson said their analysis
of ACTS records showed that in 1986 through 1989, 90 percent of
students at the school _ including some who did not meet federal
requirements _ received federal aid but that only 16 percent
completed their courses.
   During that time, $150 million in loans were guaranteed for
60,000 ACTS students. Calareso and his brother, James, who own the
school, paid themselves $12 million in salary and stock dividends,
investigators said.
   The eight-year-old school offers training for people aspiring to
careers as travel agents, motel operators and other travel-related
jobs. It uses a combination home-campus system, involving 20 mailed
lessons and a three-week stint on campus.
   In 1985, the first year it was eligible to participate in
federal student-loan programs, the school's revenues increased by
800 percent, to $5.5 million, investigators testified. Revenues
reached $34.5 million in 1989.
   Brenda Ann Brandon completed the five-week ACTS program before
going to work for the school. Once the school was certified for
participation in federal student-loan programs, she was put in
charge of student aid.
   ``We, the employees of the financial-aid office, were instructed
by Joseph Calareso to contact every new student, even cash
students, and try and get them to finance their education through a
guaranteed student loan,'' Mrs. Brandon said.
   ``This way, the school was guaranteed to receive the full
tuition up front,'' she continued. ``If a cash student is on a
payment plan, there is a lower probability that the school will
receive all of the tuition, because the majority of the students
enrolled never complete the course. With a loan, the school gets
the money early on.''
   During her time as an employee of the school _ she quit in 1988
_ Mrs. Brandon said, there was never a review of records by state,
federal or outside agencies that was based on accurate information.
   Mrs. Brandon and subcommittee investigators said the school also
submitted loan applications on behalf of students who were not
qualified by education to receive federal aid.
   Angela M. Jones of Swansea, S.C., said that in 1987 she applied
for admission to ACTS and soon received a $2,415 student loan
check. She said she was told to endorse the check and return it to
the school and was assured that it would never be deposited. She
later received a second check to cover her on-campus training.
   Ms. Jones said she was never able to complete the course because
the school failed to mail books and half her correspondence
lessons. But the school insisted she still was liable for the full
cost.

   The performance stars Pavarotti. Huffman got a chance to meet
his idol last Tuesday, when he waited backstage with 50 other fans
after a Pavarotti performance at the Metropolitan Opera.
   After the two were introduced, Pavarotti sang the ``Song of the
Shepherd'' for the boy.
   Huffman also will appear in the New York City Opera's revival of
``The Sound of Music'' next month at the New York State Theater.
   The seventh grader is a member of the Men and Boys Choir at

<HEAD>Drive-ins Cancel Kickboxer Movie After Brawls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gang-related shootings at two
drive-in theaters prompted the theaters' operators to stop showing
a movie about a gang-fighting kickboxer.
   Police said as many as 100 people and at least three gangs were
involved in a Friday night brawl during a showing of ``Angel Town''
at the Hi-Way 39 Drive-in in Westminster, about 30 miles southeast
of downtown Los Angeles.
   One 18-year-old was briefly hospitalized for a gunshot wound to
his chest.
   The same night, at the South Bay 6 drive-in complex in Los
Angeles, two reputed gang members were wounded as they strolled to
the snack bar during ``Angel Town,'' according to Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Sgt. Kenneth Brazile.
   Pacific Drive-in district manager Bob Gibson said he canceled
the film for the rest of the weekend, and local officials said they
were worried about the possibility of retaliatory attacks.
   ``I'd hate to see a gang war happen at a drive-in theater,''
said Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry. ``There are a lot of
innocent people there and bullets do a lot of traveling.''

<HEAD>Army Scientist Invents Cheap Way To Produce Spider Silk</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until recently, the Army has kept quiet about a
scientist's success in engineering the gene for spider silk into a
bacteria that produces a fiber stronger than a silkworm's silk _
indeed, far stronger than steel.
   Now the secret is out.
   The military hopes to use the new fabric for bulletproof vests,
helmets, parachute cords and other strong, light equipment. And the
folks on New York's Seventh Avenue may want to take notice _ silk
stockings may come back, too.
   The silk industry has long relied on the costly and
time-consuming farming of silkworms, a cultural and commercial
tradition in China and Japan, where the creatures have been
domesticated for centuries.
   But the mass production of spider silk may someday mean a
decline in the cost of commercial silk, according to Stephen
Lombardi, the 28-year-old civilian molecular biologist credited
with the invention.
   ``Right now they're still using the old way of doing it, with a
lot of man hours spent babysitting silkworms,'' Lombardi said.
``This process is very simple and cheap. Our intent was to mass
produce large quantities of silk cheaply and there's no reason why
the general public shouldn't have access to the technology.''
   That technology refers to Lombardi's success in isolating the
gene that produces silk in the Golden Orb weaver spider and
engineering the gene into bacteria. The bacteria in turn produces a
spider silk protein.
   Until now, spiders have never been an efficient source of silk
production. Unlike silkworms, they have not been domesticated and
rarely can be kept alive long enough to produce quantities of silk.
But with Lombardi's process, no spiders are needed.
   Jack Shamash, president of the New York-based Shamash and Sons,
the country's largest silk importers, says the idea that spider
silk could replace silkworms is ``a lot of nonsense.''
   The United States has virtually no silk production and therefore
lacks the needed network of factories and weavers to transform
available spider silk into fabrics, he said.
   ``You'll have to build a whole billion-dollar industry,'' said
Shamash. ``I very much doubt it could displace silk on the open
market.''
   Lombardi countered that his method of producing spider silk
involves sophisticated biotechnology, but wouldn't require new
factories or weavers. Existing fiber-spinning technology could be
used on the spider silk, he said.
   Lombardi, who works at the Army's sprawling research laboratory
in Natick, south of Boston, devised his method of replicating
spider silk last spring. He presented a brief report last week at
the American Association for the Advancement of Science convention
in New Orleans and will detail his discovery at an American
Chemical Society meeting here in April.
   Lombardi said scientists have studied spider silk for years in
an effort to produce it in greater quantities. Natives of New
Guinea and Madagascar have used spider silk to make fishing drop
lines for centuries. The covering of a hot air balloon on display
at the World's Fair was made of spider silk.
   Spider silk has five to 10 times the tensile strength of steel
and can be stretched about 18 percent without breaking. Because of
its toughness, spider silk is likely to replace Kevlar as the
military's choice for bulletproof vests, Lombardi said.
   Spider silk is also envisioned for parachute cording, light
tents, uniforms and even some fiber optic material. And while silk
bulletproof vests may not sound very macho to the average American
soldier, Lombardi said they will be more lightweight and even more
effective.
   ``Remember there are species of spider in Madagascar that have
ensnared small birds,'' he said. ``It's a tough fabric.''

<HEAD>Indiana House's Power-Sharing Agreement is Unraveling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A power-sharing agreement forced upon the
evenly divided Republicans and Democrats in the Indiana House is
breaking down into bickering and rules fights and may be heading
for a messy divorce.
   ``It isn't working because apparently there is a basic lack of
trust,'' said state Rep. Stephen C. Moberly, a Republican who for
years had warned his colleagues about the potential problems in a
House without a clear majority.
   ``The Republicans don't trust the Democratic speaker, and the
Democrats don't trust the Republican speaker because both can
manipulate the rules to help their party and their agenda,'' said
Moberly.
   Under the power-sharing agreement approved in November 1988,
after an election produced the half-and-half split, the 100-seat
House has Republican and Democratic speakers who preside on
alternate days and each House committee has a chairman from each
party.
   That agreement takes a two-thirds vote to change, and remains in
effect despite the defection Monday of Rep. Frank Newkirk from the
Democratic to Republican Party, which gave the GOP an edge in
voting.
   Legislative leaders boasted at the end of the 1989 session that
the arrangement worked far better than many had predicted. But this
year, the same leaders concede the setup is showing signs of strain.
   ``Over the last couple of days, it's degenerated,'' Republican
House Speaker Paul S. Mannweiler said last week. ``I think it's
just sort of unraveled.''
   Democratic Speaker Michael K. Phillips isn't as pessimistic but
concedes the system has its problems.
   ``The arrangement's working smoothly. We just disagree on the
process,'' said Phillips. ``Still, nobody's jumped over the front
desk to try to take over the speaker's chair.''
   Both ``speakers du jour'' agree there have been problems in
recent days although neither is willing to share the blame.
   Mannweiler believes the problems began when the 13 Democrats on
the 26-member House Ways and Means Committee refused to attend a
week's worth of committee hearings recently because the Democrats
didn't want to consider Republican-sponsored bills.
   That doomed most of the bills, except one that Republicans
forced out of committee by using a rarely successful blast motion
to remove a welfare caseworker bill from the committee's
jurisdiction and send the measure directly to the floor.
   Mannweiler also faults Phillips for failing one day last week to
hand down 21 committee reports on Republican bills. That delayed
consideration of the bills so they couldn't be amended by the full
House on a day when Mannweiler was presiding.
   At the same time, Democrats maintain a list of alleged misdeeds
by Republicans.
   Last week, after Democrats blocked a Republican bill to cut the
auto excise tax, the GOP retaliated with a rare maneuver in which
they called back for consideration a Democratic bill that had
already been amended on the House floor and removed their
opponents' excise tax proposal from the measure.
   Phillips protested, charging Mannweiler with ``an unprecedented
and clearly erroneous interpretation of the rules and precedents''
of the House.
   Democrats also accused Republicans of ``vultureous conduct,''
claiming the GOP was taking advantage of a temporary 50-49
numerical edge resulting from the death last week of Rep. G. Edward
Cook, whose successor will be chosen March 4. That margin grew to
51-48 with Newkirk's defection.
   ``The Republicans continue to think they can rewrite the rules
to satisfy their needs,'' said Phillips. ``I also think they would
not even be attempting this if Ed Cook were alive and in his seat.''
   Democrats also criticized Republicans' request last week for an
attorney general's opinion to determine if 50 votes, instead of the
normal constitutional majority of 51, would be enough to pass a
bill while the House temporarily has 99 members.
   The maneuvering and rare uses of House rules have created an
uneasy atmosphere. House members can regularly be seen flipping
through the chamber's 88-page rule book to determine if one side is
taking advantage of the other.
   That is likely to continue during the final six working days of
the session, which must be completed by March 15.
   Phillips threatened retaliation last week.
   ``You live by the rules, you die by the rules,'' he warned
Republicans.

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said he and
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev established a new basis for
relations Monday and said all Soviet troops would be withdrawn from
Czechoslovakia by July 1, 1991.
   Havel, the playwright and opposition leader who scripted his
country's peaceful return to democracy late last year, met with
Gorbachev after arriving on his first official visit to the Soviet
Union since he was elected Dec. 29 as his country's first
non-Communist president in 41 years.
   The visit coincided with the start of the withdrawal of 73,500
Soviet troops still in Czechoslovakia 22 years after Moscow sent
its military forces to crush the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   Havel flew to Moscow for talks with Gorbachev just three days
after returning from the United States where he met with President
Bush.
   At a news conference following the Kremlin meeting, Havel called
the joint declaration he had signed earlier with Gorbachev a ``very
important'' document that would pave the way for a new kind of
cooperation.
   The declaration calls for relations to be developed ``on the
basis of equality and complete mutual respect for each other's
state sovereignty,'' Tass reported.
   Gorbachev and Havel looked on Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze and Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier of Czechoslovakia
signed the agreement concluded in Prague on Feb. 22 outlining the
troop withdrawal.
   Havel said he hoped all of the troops would return to the Soviet
Union within one year, but that the agreement stipulated they must
be gone by July 1, 1991.
   Soviet troops spearheaded the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that
crushed the reforms.
   Moscow has 73,500 soldiers, 1,220 tanks, 2,505 armored vehicles,
77 combat aircraft and 146 helicopters stationed on Czechoslovak
soil.
   Havel said Czechoslovakia had offered to help the Soviet Union
with the withdrawal by providing free rail and water transport of
men and equipment and assistance in constructing housing for the
soldiers in the Soviet Union where there is a chronic shortage of
apartments.
   Economic issues were also raised at plenary talks between
officials of the two countries, and Havel said that Czechoslovakia
should not renew cooperation agreements that had been concluded by
the previous Communist government. However, economic matters were
not the focus of the trip.
   In addition to Havel and Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak delegation
includes Defense Minister Miroslav Vacek and Interior Minister
Richard Sacher who is interested in reducing the links between
officials of his ministry and those of the Soviet KGB operative on
Czechoslovak soil.
   Havel, who spent five years in prison for his political
activities against the totalitarian state _ an experience that is
the source and strength of many of his writings _ appeared to be
adjusting well to the role of a world statesmen.
   He seemed at ease at the news conference and said that during
his talks with Bush and Gorbachev that both leaders had recognized
the special role that Czechoslovakia had to play in the center of
Europe.
   The Czechoslovak model of a peaceful recovery of democracy has
also won admirers among opposition movements from the Soviet
republic of Moldavia to the three Baltic republics, which are
pressing for independence from Moscow.
   During his meeting with Gorbachev, Havel touched on the rapidly
changing political situation in Europe. Last week in Washington, he
had called on the United States to support moves toward democratic
reform in the Soviet Union as a contribution to stability in Europe.
   However, he said that he had no specific message from Bush for
Gorbachev.
   The two leaders also discussed the rapid rapprochement of the
two Germanys.
   Havel said he told Gorbachev the reunification of Germany should
be ``conducted in a way that would not complicate the whole
European unification process, but would rather service as a motor
for that process.''
   On Tuesday, the former dissident is scheduled to meet with
Yelena Bonner, widow of Andrei Sakharov, the Nobel Peace prize
winner, who was a source of inspiration for a generation of
opposition activists in Eastern Europe.

   Jesse L. Jackson announced Monday he will not
run for mayor of the ``dispirited'' nation's capital but he refused
to rule out a third bid for the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1992.
   ``I want to continue to serve, but not as mayor,'' Jackson said.
``At present I believe that I may best serve by continuing work at
a national level to change the direction of this country.''
   ``You have to almost predict a rerun of '88,'' said John White,
a former national party chairman who advised Jackson in the late
stages of his 1988 presidential bid.
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of much
conjecture since he moved to the District of Columbia last April.
Speculation about a Jackson mayoral candidacy increased after Mayor
Marion Barry's arrest last month on a cocaine possession charge and
subsequent enrollment in a substance abuse treatment program.
   Jackson said he would continue to support the district's efforts
to become a state, but he also said his Rainbow Coalition would
press for action on issues at the national level, including changes
in federal tax law, increased voter registration and expanding the
federal government's housing programs.
   Jackson did not rule out another bid for the White House in 1992.
   ``It's premature,'' said the civil rights leader. ``We won't
rule it in, but it's not the season for it.''
   A top Jackson aide, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
suggested Jackson's current plans could provide a springboard for
another presidential effort.
   ``It's too early to tell, too early to tell,'' the aide said.
``But if we pull statehood, these other things together, it gives
us a lot of ways to jump, and another national campaign is
certainly one.''
   Jackson said his decision not to run was made difficult by ``the
respect we have ... for the many people who have encouraged us to
run.''
   ``The district is divided and dispirited,'' Jackson said. ``I
want to be a part of the healing process. My desire is to serve and
uplift.''
   One local supporter said the two-time Democratic presidential
hopeful became convinced that a Jackson mayoral campaign might not
have widespread voter support.
   ``Jesse wasn't convinced that there was a unanimity of support
for him, a groundswell,'' the supporter said. ``He became aware
that more and more people were thinking of him as something of an
interloper.''
   A Washington Post poll released last week found Barry was
preferred by 25 percent of those surveyed, while 19 percent said
they would vote for Jackson.
   If Barry were not in the race, Jackson would receive support
from 26 percent of those questioned, compared with 19 percent for
city Councilman John Ray. The poll, based on interviews with 800
registered voters, had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
   Ray, a leading contender for the job, said Jackson's
announcement ``takes a major player out of the race.''
   Barry's re-election plans remain on hold as the mayor battles an
eight-count indictment on cocaine possession and perjury charges
filed against him earlier this month.
   Walter Fauntroy, the district's Democratic non-voting delegate
to Congress, has said he will announce Saturday whether to enter
the mayoral race.

   The U.S. Postal Service on Monday announced a
reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to a conviction in
a mail bombing that injured a pastor's daughter at his church.
   Postal inspectors, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms and Houston police are still investigating the bomb
that exploded Jan. 30 when Lisa Osteen opened her father's mail at
the Lakewood Church.
   ``This is a top priority investigation for all three agencies,''
said postal inspector Allison T. Brown.
   The bomb is believed to have been mailed from North Carolina on
or about Jan. 26, said Judith Groome, another postal inspector in
Houston.
   Miss Osteen, 31, was hospitalized for 11 days for treatment of
bruises and flash burns from the bomb that exploded in her lap. She
is director of ministries at the 10,000-member non-denominational
church where her father, John Osteen, is pastor.
   The explosion was not believed connected to mail bombs that
killed a judge in Alabama and a city councilman in Savannah, Ga.

<HEAD>Ex-Reagan Aides Exult, Credit Nicaraguans as Much as U.S. Policy</HEAD>

   Former U.S. officials who helped mount
military and economic opposition to the Nicaraguan government
celebrated the defeat of Daniel Ortega on Monday but credited the
courage of the Nicaraguan people as much as any U.S. efforts.
   The election triumph by Violeta Chamorro ``vindicates the
struggle of many brave men and women,'' said Oliver North, who had
been a key figure in the Reagan administration's effort to drive
Nicaragua's leftist government from power.
   However, former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said
that in a way ``we were totally responsible because we never gave
up the struggle.''
   North, the former National Security Council aide, said of the
Nicaraguans, ``Without the bravery of those people, the victory of
democracy today would not have occurred. ... This was an answer to
the prayers of many people.''
   North, who was convicted of three felonies for his role in the
Iran-Contra affair, was a crucial figure in the Reagan policy of
providing military support for the Contra rebels. He was found
guilty last year of shredding Contra-related documents and of
concealing his role in aiding the rebels at a time when U.S.
involvement was barred.
   Veterans of the Reagan campaign to support the Contras were
giddy on Monday as they compared notes in phone calls to each other
about what to many once seemed like a lost cause.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams joined two
one-time aides, Otto Reich and Jonathan Miller, for a champagne
lunch at an upscale restaurant to celebrate the news from Managua.
   More than most of his colleagues, Abrams credited American
policy with the outcome.
   Asked how crucial the U.S. role was, Abrams said, ``In a sense
we were totally responsible because we never gave up the struggle.
A lot of people wanted to give up but we never gave it up. As soon
as the Nicaraguan people had a chance, they got rid of their
oppressors.''
   Abrams' predecessor at the State Department, Tony Motley, said
pressure from the Contras as well as the U.S. trade embargo
contributed to the election result. But through unwise policies, he
said, the Sandinistas ``showed themselves to be fully capable of
screwing up the situation they inherited.''
   Miller, who served with North at the National Security Council,
said, ``I'm just giddy.'' More decisive than anything the United
States might have done, he said, was ``the bravery and
sophistication of the Nicaraguan people.''
   Said Reich, a former ambassador to Venezuela, ``We put some of
our treasure and political prestige on the line, but they (the
Nicaraguans) put their lives on the line. This is a great day for
democracy.''
   Taking a different tack from the former Reagan officials, Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said the election results vindicated the peace
plan drawn up in 1987 by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. A key
element of that plan called for an end to U.S. military aid to the
Contras.
   Sunday's outcome, he said, offers ``dramatic proof of the
success of the Arias peace plan and the failure of the Contra
war.'' Six months after the peace plan was adopted, Congress agreed
to cut off military aid to the Contras, ignoring Reagan
administration objections.
   Constantine Menges, a former Latin America hand at the National
Security Council, said the ``courage and good sense of the
Nicaraguan people produced this result.''
   But he said the Sandinistas should not be counted out yet. He
predicted government hardliners in Managua will try to maintain
dominance through use of the secret police, the military and the
party bureaucracy.

<HEAD>Riot Police Use Tear Gas, Grenades To Block Students</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riot police used tear gas and stun
grenades Monday to stop student protesters from reaching the
presidential office, where the government discussed an economic
crisis that is provoking increased dissent.
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny chaired the meeting with
workers and employers, who reportedly reacted negatively to his
proposals for more austerity measures.
   A delegate at the meeting said Houphouet-Boigny told them he was
postponing a National Council meeting to consider their response.
The council of 2,000 delegates from organizations and interest
groups including trade unions, businesses and legislators,
originally was to meet Monday.
   The delegate, who requested anonymity, said the meeting was
particularly disturbed by a proposal to increase a ``solidarity
tax'' on income from 1 percent to 10 percent.
   A foreign journalist watched a carload of policemen strew tear
gas grenades along the route to the presidential palace before
Houphouet-Boigny drove up.
   While they met, about 200 students ran through downtown Abidjan,
demanding the release of detained colleagues and freedom of
expression. They also demanded a meeting with the president.
   Riot police fired tear gas and hurled a stun grenade in a noisy
explosion heard throughout the city center, scattering the
frightened protesters.
   At the National University of Ivory Coast campus, in Cocody
suburb, students said police fired tear gas to disperse about 150
students who were ``shouting slogans and demanding their right to
dissent.''
   In the residential suburb of Adjame, police beat up students and
children who set up a blockade outside the marketplace, witnesses
said.
   Witnesses said police also fired tear gas and hurled stun
grenades at students in Yopougon, a working class suburb where the
urest began Feb. 19, when they refused to board three buses going
from their dormitories to the main university campus three miles
away.
   Students said they were observing a boycott, defying an appeal
by the president Sunday night for the unrest to end and classes to
resume.
   Houphouet-Boigny made the call after he ordered the release of
137 students who were beaten and detained Saturday after they ended
a 10-hour occupation of St. Paul's Roman Catholic cathedral in the
capital's center.
   Students say many more students remain in detention. The
government says all protesters have been freed.
   The students said they are protesting social injustices best
illustrated by the system of grants.
   ``Some (Cabinet) ministers sons and other high-ranking
government officials' children who drive to the university in BMWs
are given grants. We, whose parents are poor farmers whose incomes
have been halved, do not get grants,'' a militant student leader
charged.
   In October, Houphouet-Boigny was forced to halve prices for
cocoa and coffee promised to Ivorian farmers after years of
subsidizing them.
   In another telling sign of the cumulative effects of a
10-year-old recession, the government slashed salaries of employees
of state-run companies by 30 percent this month. Other government
employees have suffered an eight-year wage freeze.
   Students are demanding that the salaries of Cabinet ministers
also be cut by 30 percent. Sources close to the government said
Monday that the president is considering their demand.
   Houphouet-Boigny has not been receptive to demands that he
introduce a multiparty state in this West African nation that he
has ruled since it became independent from France in 1960.
   While other authoritarian governments close to the Ivory Coast
have bowed to popular pressure and are introducing democratic
reforms _ such as the military government of Guinea _
Houphouet-Boigny has insisted that a multiparty system encourages
tribal divisions and endangers national unity.

   Brisk exports and heavy domestic use are
draining off U.S. cotton inventories and boosting prices, the
Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Domestic mills used 7.8 million bales in 1988-89, the
department's Economic Research Service said in a preliminary report.
   ``This season, strong denim demand and apparel sales are
expected to push consumption to 8.2 million bales, the highest in
nearly two decades,'' the report said. ``Mill use for the first six
months of the season average about 8.4 million bales on a
seasonally adjusted annual rate.''
   Cotton exports are forecast at 7.7 million bales this season, up
25 percent from 6.15 million bales in 1988-89. As of mid-February,
outstanding sales and shipments totaled nearly 7 million bales,
compared with 4.7 million at this time last season.
   The U.S. cotton inventory by Aug. 1 is expected to be about 3.5
million bales, about half the 7.09 million on hand last Aug. 1.
   ``During the 1989-90 marketing year, both U.S. and world prices
for cotton have exceeded those of the past season by substantial
margins,'' the report said. ``The adjusted world price for August
to mid-November averaged 67 cents per pound this season, about 23
cents ahead of the comparable-period average last season.''

   The Postal Service is not violating
free-speech rights by banning everyone, from the Red Cross to
political extremists, from soliciting donations outside most post
offices, the Supreme Court was told Monday.
   Justice Department lawyer John Roberts Jr., representing the
Postal Service, said the area outside suburban or rural post
offices is not ``a traditional public forum'' as is the city
sidewalk outside an urban post office.
   Most of the nation's 35,000 post offices have their own
sidewalks surrounded by parking lots. ``This property is dedicated
to the Postal Service's use,'' Roberts contended. ``It's not just
like a city sidewalk'' where free-speech rights must be considered.
   But Washington lawyer Jay Sekulow disagreed. ``The right to
solicit ... classic political speech is not subject to
architectural design,'' he said. ``A moat cannot be created by this
intervening parking lot.''
   At issue in a case from Bowie, Md., is a federal regulation
banning ``soliciting, electioneering, collecting debts, vending and
advertising'' on Postal Service property.
   A federal appeals court ruled in the Bowie case that the
regulation is unconstitutional, but other courts have upheld it in
other cases.
   Sekulow's clients, Marsha Kokinda and Kevin Pearl, were arrested
Aug. 6, 1986, after they refused to stop soliciting contributions
and distributing literature from a table on the sidewalk just
outside the Bowie post office.
   The two are volunteers for the National Democratic Policy
Committee, the political arm of an organization headed by political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche.
   They were convicted of violating the federal regulation although
there was no evidence they had blocked or interfered with people
entering and leaving the post office. About 30 patrons had
complained about the couple's presence.
   ``Would there have been any complaints if it were the Red
Cross?'' Justice Anthony M. Kennedy asked the Justice Department
lawyer.
   ``Probably not,'' Roberts answered, although adding that the
blanket ban on soliciting prevents postal officials from favoring
some groups over others.
   Roberts said the regulation is not being enforced against people
who hand out leaflets, seek petition signatures or picket but only
against those who solicit immediate contributions.
   ``It's when you let them ask for money that the crowds come
out,'' he said.
   But Roberts said the Postal Service would not violate
free-speech rights if it chose to banish from its property all
activities not linked directly to postal business.
   Sekulow argued that the Postal Service never has elected to make
its property ``an enclave immune from the First Amendment.''
   When Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked if the Postal Service
must allow panhandling on its sidewalks, Sekulow said beggars have
the same free-speech rights as anyone else, subject to the same
time, place and manner regulations.
   O'Connor also asked Roberts why such time, place and manner
regulations _ and not a total ban _ would not be an effective way
to prevent congestion or inconvenience.
   Several other justices also voiced concern over the sweep of a
blanket ban.
   ``Why isn't it (the regulation) overbroad?'' Justice Byron R.
White asked.
   And Justice John Paul Stevens asked, ``Is there a history of a
problem outside'' the buildings. ``One might argue it (the
regulation) is overbroad.''
   The case is U.S. vs. Kokinda, 88-2031.

<HEAD>U.N. Report on Human Rights in Iran Inconclusive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations on Monday released a largely
inconclusive report on the human rights situation in Iran, based on
the first visit by a special U.N. investigator since it came under
international scrutiny in 1984.
   The 76-page report, compiled by Salvadoran jurist Reynaldo
Galindo Pohl under a mandate from the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
cites evidence of torture and other gross violations, along with
denials.
   But he concedes that in many cases it was not possible to
conduct an in-depth examination during the week-long stay last
month and suggests a renewal of his mandate and another visit.
   The report lists the names of about 700 people allegedly
executed in Iran, most of them in the past two years, along with 39
people alleged to have been executed by the Iraq-based Mujahedeen
resistance. Iranian media reports have said that more than 1,300
were executed in Iran in slightly less than one year and Western
human rights groups have carried much higher estimates.
   Galindo Pohl said that barring specific proof he rules out
allegations that political prisoners had been executed under false
charges of drug trafficking.
   He said there had been no public executions for five months,
although ``probably hundreds are still awaiting execution.'' He
added that he requested clemency for them and that he ``gained the
impression that this harsh policy (of executions) could become a
good deal less severe.''
   Quoting testimony from several unidentified Iranians, the report
refers to one witness who said five of his seven children were
executed as suspected Mujahedeen members in an alleged wave of
executions of 20,000 prisoners since the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
Two sons were still in prison, one of them sick and the other
paralyzed as the result of torture, according to the witness.
   But the report also notes that several people told the
investigator that they had been wrongly listed by the Mujahedeen as
victims of executions. It also included a list of various alleged
acts of terrorism by the Mujahedeen. It said some witnesses said
they had been induced to show self-inflicted marks of torture to
enhance the ``false propaganda'' spread by the resistance.
   The Mujahedeen, in a statement sent to news agencies, denounced
the report as the result of an ``ominous pact between the U.N.
Center for Human Rights and the most abominable regime of our
times.'' Galindo Pohl, the statement said, ``takes the side of the
executioner rather than the victim.''
   Describing a visit to Tehran's notorious Evin prison, Galindo
Pohl said he was welcomed by a choir and a small band made up of
prisoners. In the presence of Evin officials, he talked to the
former secretary general of the outlawed Tudeh party who told of
being tortured and showed his partially paralyzed hands and crushed
fingers.
   Prisoners in the women's section told Galindo Pohl they had not
been tortured or subjected to ill treatment.
   In addition to the former Tudeh leader, the report lists six
other witnesses as describing having undergone torture. One said
that about 90 percent of all Evin prison inmates had been ``either
severely tortured or submitted to treatment akin to torture.''
   But the report also listed four other witnesses, in addition to
the Evin women prisoners, who said they had never seen or heard of
torture cases except occasional slapping.

<TEXT>
   More than 20,000 people chanting
``Democracy!'' and ``Liberty!'' massed in the capital Monday in a
rally against the ruling Communist Party.
   The peaceful demonstration was the second in two straight days.
At least 150,000 people gathered Sunday in Sofia chanting ``Down
with the Communist Party!'' in the largest rally since the toppling
of hard-line leader Todor Zhivkov in November.
   During Monday's protest, the crowd, which carried lighted
candles and jangled their keys, gathered again in the square in
front of the Communist Party headquarters in response to an appeal
of the Union of Democratic Forces grouping major opposition
movements.
   Both rallies were staged despite decisions of the party's
Supreme Council on Friday to ban Communist cells at the workplace,
postpone general elections from May to June _ the opposition had
sought a delay until November to give it time to prepare _ and call
foreign observers to monitor the voting.
   While professing a commitment to democracy, the Communist Party
is in sole control of government and appears less willing to
compromise with opposition forces than sister parties in Soviet
bloc countries further on the path to pluralism.
   Participants at the Monday rally said the opposition planned to
continue to organize such demonstrations as a way to pressure the
Communist Party into accepting its demands for full democracy at
talks between the two sides that opened in early January.
   Also Monday, a congress of the Bulgarian Communist youth union
decided to split into three groups with the majority of the
delegates voting for the setting up of a new independent youth
organization called Bulgarian Democratic Youth.
   A second splinter group announced plans to form another
independent organization called the ``Youth Confederation,'' while
a third smaller group said it wanted to form a ``Youth Forum for
Socialism,'' which would maintain its links with the ruling
Communist Party.

   A homicide suspect surrendered Monday, hours
after seeing himself profiled on the network television show
``America's Most Wanted,'' authorities said.
   James Edward Noel showed up unannounced at the police
department's Central Station.
   ```I believe you might be looking for me. I want to give myself
up,''' Officer Bill Frio, a police spokesman, said Noel told
officers at the front desk.
   Noel, a 45-year-old day laborer who was profiled on the Fox
Network's Sunday night show, was taken into custody on a no-bail
murder warrant.
   He was wanted in connection with the Oct. 2 slaying of
18-year-old Wendy Tarr, an apartment leasing agent who was shot in
the head during a robbery attempt as she showed an apartment.
   Frio said Noel was on parole for a series of robberies and rapes
in Fresno, Los Angeles and San Diego in which apartment managers
were targeted.
   Fox officials said that of the 228 fugitives the show has
profiled, 148 are in custody, 97 as a direct result of the TV show.
   Viewers tipped authorities to the whereabouts of most of those
arrested, but nine people have surrendered, said Phil Gonzales, the
show's publicist.

   Violeta Chamorro's presidential victory in
Nicaragua brought elation on Capitol Hill on Monday but also
heightened Congress' problem of finding foreign aid money for new
democracies.
   ``We must provide her new government with aid, and let's not kid
ourselves _ it will take big bucks,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``She needs our help and she deserves it.''
   ``Nobody said democracy was cheap,'' added Foreign Affairs
Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., while not mentioning a
specific aid figures, said the United States might start by sending
amounts similar to past aid to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.
Estimates ranged from $100 million to $300 million as the U.S.
share of a multilateral package that could provide $1 billion for
Nicaragua.
   But others cautioned that with a growing line of potential new
foreign aid recipients _ Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Panama
and others _ it would be difficult to promise new money when the
budget already is falling short.
   ``It's not realistic to expect the result of all this is going
to be a tripling of foreign aid,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards,
R-Okla., the senior GOP member of the foreign aid subcommittee.
``The American people aren't going to support it.''
   This year, the United States will send about $9.8 billion in
military, economic and development aid to several dozen friendly
countries around the globe. The lion's share, $5.1 billion, goes to
Israel and Egypt as a reward for entering into the Camp David peace
process. The Bush administration has asked for a slight increase in
the total, to $10.1 billion, for 1991.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., said he hoped the United States
could come up with $200 million to $300 million as a contribution
to a billion-dollar international emergency aid program for
Nicaragua, similar to those aiding the Philippines and emerging
democracies in Eastern Europe. The money should be taken out of the
U.S. defense budget, he said.
   Dole used the occasion of Chamorro's win over leftist Sandinista
President Daniel Ortega on Sunday to renew his proposal to alter
the nation's foreign aid priorities, beginning with the two largest
recipients, Israel and Egypt.
   ``The only way we're going to pay for new aid to Nicaragua,
Panama, Czechoslovakia _ is to look to the foreign aid budget that
now exists, and make some tough calls,'' Dole said in a Senate
floor speech.
   But that proposal has so far met with stiff opposition, and
Foley cautioned that Nicaragua should not automatically be given
priority over current recipients of U.S. aid.
   Lawmakers overwhelmingly supported President Bush's call for a
speedy lifting of trade sanctions, and many called for the
immediate sending of a U.S. ambassador to Managua. The sanctions
were imposed in 1985, and the American ambassador was sent home in
1988.
   Many of the legislators observed that Chamorro's win had
accelerated an already breathtaking downfall of communism around
the world.
   Asked his reaction, Edwards said, ``It was astonishment... It's
happening from one end of the world to the other, the tyrants are
being swept out.''
   ``It is yet another example of the desire for democratic
government that is being courageously expressed by people
throughout the world living under totalitarian regimes,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Several members of Congress also noted that the demise of the
Sandinista government could have an added benefit in nearby El
Salvador, where leftist FMLN guerrillas fighting the elected
government have relied on Managua for weapons and support.
   At the same time, the lawmakers warned that Chamorro faces a
difficult road in rebuilding her nation's economy, moving her
country out of war and maintaining her political coalition.
   ``Much remains to be done before democracy can be said to have
been established in Nicaragua,'' said House Minority Leader Robert
Michel, R-Ill., ``but this victory is a splendid beginning.''
   From the other side of the political spectrum, Rep. Sam
Gejdenson, D-Conn., called the outcome ``an amazing step forward
for the Western Hemisphere'' and long overdue.
   Gejdenson, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
attributed Chamorro's victory to her call for an end to the
military draft; the country's economy, devastated by a decade of
civil war and U.S. economic sanctions, and a popular belief that
she could best demobilize the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.

<TEXT>
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins pronounced
conservatism dead Monday, saying that as communist governments fail
worldwide, the Far Right has no reason to exist.
   ``The crest of the conservative flood has passed,'' Dinkins, a
Democrat, said in a speech to the National Press Club. ``The
Republicans still occupy the White House, but the conservative
coalition has lost its way.''
   Dinkins acknowledged that reporters may not believe him and
``may not be ready to report what I've said as fact, but hopefully
soon you will recognize that what I say is true.''
   In a sometimes poetic speech that compared conservatives to
holograms, ``images of bent light that vanish as we walk by,'' and
their cause to a spent volcano, Dinkins argued that revolutions in
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union herald the death of communism.
That, in turn, mean the end of U.S. conservatives, he said.
   ``Without communism, they have no enemy, and without an enemy,
they have no energy,'' he said.
   Dinkins pointed to his own, 2-month-old administration as
evidence that government can be ``sensitive to the needs and
aspirations of all our people.''
   He also predicted that the political right will not be able to
win office by running as anti-abortionists, citing as proof his
election and alluding to the elections of New Jersey Gov. James
Florio and Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder.
   ``Who would have thought a year ago that even the chairman of
the Republican National Committee would claim to be agnostic on
abortion?'' he asked. ``The effort to make God a partisan political
being has failed. She will judge our performance later.''

   The drop that has rocked the Tokyo Stock
Exchange during the past few days has so far caused little more
than a ripple on Wall Street.
   Analysts see plenty of cause for caution about the U.S.
financial outlook as a result of the Japanese market's slide, which
intensified Monday with its second-largest point decline ever.
   But the worries of many U.S. observers have been tempered by a
belief that the selling might prove to be primarily a
``correction'' of speculative enthusiasm that has been unique to
Tokyo trading for years.
   With a 4.5 percent decline Monday, the Nikkei average of 225
Japanese stocks extended its fall since the start of 1990 to more
than 14 percent.
   In New York, by contrast, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 38.29 points to 2,602.48 on Monday, narrowing its
loss for the year to date to 5.5 percent.
   The comparatively better performance by American stocks during
that period is something of a rarity.
   Two decades ago, the leading indexes of American and Japanese
stocks stood at about the same absolute level. By the end of 1989,
riding the crest of their country's long industrial and commercial
boom, Japanese prices were about 12 times higher than their U.S.
counterparts.
   Along the way, shares in Tokyo reached levels considered
outlandish by traditional Wall Street standards, such as the ratio
of stock prices to the earnings per share of the companies involved.
   Recently, price-earnings ratios in Japan have been as high as 60
to one, compared with about 12 to one in the United States. Despite
numerous arguments that the figures aren't directly comparable, and
that Japanese business has earned the extra recognition, many U.S.
analysts have remained unconvinced.
   ``American investors have thought for at least five years that
the Tokyo market was grossly overvalued,'' said Robert Stovall,
president of the New York money management firm
Stovall-Twenty-First Advisors.
   The drop in Tokyo has been accompanied by a fierce debate over
the computer-driven strategies known as program trading, with
expectations increasing that Japanese officials will soon move to
curtail this type of activity.
   That's all too familiar to participants in the American markets,
where similar trading _ which critics say makes stock prices more
volatile _ has stirred similar controversy for several years.
   ``I think it's exactly the same thing,'' said Suresh Bhirud, an
analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
   Many American analysts acknowledge that U.S. views of the
Japanese market are influenced by a streak of international
competitiveness, if not jealousy. They also point out that as
Japanese stocks have slumped, the dollar has risen in value against
the yen in world currency markets.
   ``It's good for the dollar and it's good for the American
psyche,'' Stovall said. ``The Japanese are proving to be human.''
   Whatever emotional satisfaction it may offer in American
financial circles, however, there is also widespread concern that
the Tokyo decline may have a widening negative impact if it
continues much longer.
   For starters, a pinch on Japanese investors could induce them to
pull money out of markets around the world _ such as the U.S.
Treasury bond market _ where they have been playing an active role.
   In addition, analysts say, the drop in the Tokyo market has been
prompted by rising interest rates in many of the world's financial
capitals that may be increasing the odds of a worldwide recession.
   Thom Brown, an analyst at Rutherford, Browth &amp; Catherwood Inc.
in Philadelphia, says it would be reckless to ignore trouble
warnings about the Japanese market simply because they have proved
incorrect so far.
   ``To reiterate this warning does sound like crying wolf,'' he
said. ``But remember the fable _ the wolf finally arrived.''

   A vial containing krypton 79 gas that
was to be injected into a nuclear reactor accidentally broke but no
employees were contaminated, officials reported Monday.
   Nine people were in the confinement dome of the Creys-Malville
reactor Sunday when the vial of radioactive gas broke. The Central
Ionizing Radiation Protection Service, a government agency, said
there were no injuries.
   ``Neither portable equipment nor later checks in the on-site
infirmary showed the slightest contamination and these people
resumed their work normally Monday morning,'' the agency's
statement said.
   The room where the accident occurred was evacuated Sunday
morning. It was aired out and reopened at 9 p.m.
   ``The ejection of the radioactive gas by the chimney after the
handling accident represented a total of less than one-100,000th of
the annual activity authorized,'' the agency said, adding the
incident was ``without consequence to public health or the
environment.''
   The reactor has been shut down since October 1989 for
maintenance. It is scheduled to be restarted March.

<HEAD>FDA Claims It's Doing More to Protect Against Faulty Mecical
Devices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Food and Drug Administration
said Monday the agency has taken steps to minimize the chances that
faulty medical devices ever reach consumers.
   ``We believe that the agency's procedures have matured
significantly over the last decade,'' since the FDA approved a
mechanical heart valve made by Shiley Inc. that later was removed
from the market after reports of fatal malfunctions, said Acting
FDA Commissioner James Benson.
   ``This maturation minimizes the possibility that faulty devices
can reach the market,'' he told members of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee.
   But Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the panel, said:
``We have no assurance that the conditions at the FDA which
permitted this valve to enter the market and stay for far too long
have been corrected.''
   He charged that the FDA moved too slowly against the heart valve
and exposed hundreds of patients to unnecessary risk.
   Among the steps the FDA said it has taken are stronger criteria
for approving implantable devices, better scientific analysis in
the approval process and an improved early-warning system for
detecting problems with devices already on the market, he said.
   A report by the subcommittee's majority staff raised quesions
about the FDA's ``willingness and ability to fulfill its regulatory
mandate to protect public health'' and charged that Shiley, owned
by Pfizer Inc., misled the agency and failed to keep the FDA
informed of malfunction reports.
   Pfizer officials denied those charges. Robert Fauteux, a
spokesman for the company, said, ``we met the obligations under the
law.''
   Republican members of the subcommittee, while concerned about
the Shiley valve, said they were also concerned that report failed
to recognize the inherent risks of medical devices and that the
heart valve has saved the lives of tens of thousands of patients.
   The risks of the Shiley valve ``must be considered with a great
deal of caution,'' said Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va. ``We must to
everything possible to avoid alarming'' patients who are living
with the device.
   Shiley's convexo-concave 60-degree heart valve, approved in
April 1979, has been implanted in 85,000 people, including about
40,000 in the United States. After reports of malfunctions and
product withdrawals, Shiley removed it from the market in November
1986.
   About 4,000 of Shiley's 70-degree valves have been implanted in
patients overseas. That device was never marketed in the United
States.
   Shiley has reported to the FDA a total of 295 fractures of the
60-degree valve, with 178 deaths resulting, and 94 fractures and 70
deaths involving the 70-degree valve, according to the
subcommittee's report.
   The valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a
teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve
in place. The disc, pivoting on two thin metal struts, opens to
either a 60-degree or 70-degree angle to allow blood to flow
through, and then closes.
   The fractures have occurred in the struts. When a fracture
occurs the disc escapes from the ring, allowing an uncontrollable
blood flow through the heart.
   Benson said that when the FDA approved the mechanical valve,
agency officials were aware of the strut fracture problems with the
Shiley valve, but they believed it produced fewer life-threatening
blood-clot complications than older-model valves on the market.
   After evaluating the clinical data submitted by Shiley, the
agency concluded that ``this advantage outweighed, or at least
balanced, the strut fracture problem,'' Benson said.
   But in June 1984, the FDA performed its own analysis and
determined that the Shiley valve did not decrease blood-clotting
complications.
   Responding to criticism that the FDA notified physicians rather
than patients about the risk of strut fracture in the valves,
Benson said the agency continues to believe the informing
physicians is most appropriate, since they can judge the extent to
which a warning causes anxiety in a patient.
   However, Frederick Barbee of Minong, Wis., whose wife died after
her valve fractured, said that if he had known about the risks, he
might have been able to get his wife appropriate medical care
faster and save her life.

<HEAD>Bush Unveils Drug Guide For Parents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush unveiled a booklet Monday with
crayon drawings by kids and tips for parents on how to persuade
their children to steer clear of drugs.
   ``Drug education must begin at home,'' the president said.
   The 52-page booklet, ``Growing Up Drug Free: A Parent's Guide to
Prevention,'' is available free from the U.S. Department of
Education by calling 1-800-624-0100 or, in the Washington area,
202-732-3627. Copies can also be obtained from the Consumer
Information Center, Pueblo, Colo., 81009.
   ``This little book ... is going to do a lot of good,'' Bush
predicted.
   Ten girls and boys who illustrated the pamphlet joined Bush on
stage for the unveiling.
   He pressed Katie Bell, whose crayon drawing of a happy family
made the cover, into service.
   ``You better come here,'' he said, drawing the girl in a red
dress and blue bow to his side. Later he thrust a booklet into her
hands as a prop, saying, ``Hold this for me, would you?''
   If the other children felt left out, it wasn't for long. As soon
as Bush finished speaking, he went through the book page by page
until he had identified each piece of art _ children skipping rope
and playing basketball, as well as a jester-like figure with eyes
bulging out of its head _ with the artist.
   ``You did this? Beautiful,'' the president gushed.
   Apart from the cute pictures, the booklet features some hard
facts for parents about drugs, a quiz and tips on how to impart
values to youngsters.
   ``This guide book is being released because we all care about
kids, about keeping their futures bright with promise and keeping
them free of the enslavement of drugs,'' said Bush.
   ``You don't get a pep course before becoming a parent, and kids
don't come with owner's manuals. They have minds and problems of
their own. So the best thing parents can do is talk to them and,
just as important, listen to them. Know the facts about drugs and
the warning signs that a kid's in trouble,'' he said.
   ``Above all, we parents can make sure that our actions are as
good as our words. Where illegal drugs and alcohol abuse are
concerned, for too long we have condoned what we should have
condemned,'' said Bush.
   ``That's what this book is about: knowing when and how to talk
to your kids, when to listen, where to draw the line and when to
get help.''
   ``Schools, churches, synagogues, community groups, law
enforcement _ all can help us turn the tide on drug and alcohol
abuse. But none can take a parent's place. Drug education must
begin at home and in the neighborhood long before the classroom.''
   ``I want to urge parents everywhere to read ... `Growing Up Drug
Free,''' said Bush, who was also joined at the publication ceremony
by Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos.
   Katie Bell and most of the other children were from Oakview
Elementary School in Fairfax County, Va.
   Bush gave the first copy of the booklet to Ann Lynch, president
of the National PTA. ``That one is for you, you lucky duck,'' he
told her.

   Several thousand East Germans applied Monday
for the first benefits their government has ever given the
unemployed, whose ranks may swell dramatically as the nation moves
toward capitalism.
   Labor officials said the number of applicants was much smaller
than anticipated, but noted that economic reforms expected to cost
hundreds of thousands of jobs have yet to be made.
   At the moment, East Germany has a severe labor shortage because
skilled workers continue leaving for West Germany. Industrial
production has slowed and the nation is threatened with financial
collapse.
   West Germany has offered to bail out the East Germans by making
its strong Deutschmark the currency of both countries, but only on
condition East Germany adopt a market economy.
   No final decision on monetary union and the economic reforms is
planned until after East Germany's first free elections March 18,
but a decisive shift toward Western economic practices is expected
soon afterward.
   Economists say more competitive Western methods will force many
East German factories to close or lay off employees, which could
increase unemployment among the 9 million workers to 15 percent
within months.
   Finance Ministry officials proposed Monday that laws be altered
to create more incentive for private enterprise by reducing income
tax rates that require entrepreneurs to pay up to 95 percent of
profits to the government.
   Lower taxes also would encourage formation of small and
medium-sized businesses, which could help reduce unemployment.
   Meanwhile, the East German news agency ADN reported only about
10,000 people took part in regular Monday demonstrations in Leipzig
that started the motor of East German reform in October with more
than 100,000 marchers weekly.
   The numbers of Monday demonstrators have dwindled in recent
weeks, as campaigning for March 18 elections has gotten under way.
   At the weekly negotiations with opposition groups, Defense
Minister Theodor Hoffmann said reducing the size of East Germany's
army would only increase the number of unemployed.
   Neues Deutschland, the Communist Party newspaper, proposed
Monday that compulsory military service be ended in both Germanys
and that a reunited Germany be demilitarized.
   East Germany has experienced some unemployment throughout its
40-year history, but authorities would not acknowledge the problem
because it contradicted Communist ideology.
   On Monday, Labor Agency offices began taking applications for
financial aid to the unemployed under regulations adopted Feb. 9.
   They provide monthly payments of three-quarters of previous
income, made up of 500 East German marks (about $100 at the
official exchange rate) from the government and a contribution from
the applicant's last employer.
   Labor Agency statistics indicate 7,500 East Germans are out of
work, but unofficial estimates put the number at 10 times that.
About 25,000 people lost their jobs when the government disbanded
the secret police, under pressure from pro-democracy groups.
   Officials said they were not certain how many East Germans
applied for jobless benefits Monday, since people must apply at
local offices hroughout the country.
   Only a few dozen applicants were at the East Berlin office on
Rosa Luxemburg Street, in contrast with the 4,000 the Labor
Ministry had expected.
   ``We are completely surprised that so few have come,'' said
Joachim Guenter, spokesman for the Labor and Wages Ministry.
   Brigitte Schneider, a 52-year-old teacher, said she had been
denied work in her profession because she was considered a
``traitor'' for not returning from a visit to West Germany in 1988.
   She came back later that year, but was forced to take a job with
a music publishing enterprise. She quit in January.
   ``I'm trying to get a little money, as I don't know how else I
will get by,'' she said. Ms. Schneider said she was living off
savings, and ``now I have to worry about surviving.''
   Although the official unemployment rate remains below 1 percent,
tens of thousands of people are in jobs that will be made obsolete
by better technology and others probably will be victims of more
efficient operating procures.
   The flight of 340,000 people to West Germany last year and more
than 100,000 more since Jan. 1, 1990, has transferred the immediate
unemployment problem to West Germany, where more than 2 million
people are out of work.
   A report Monday by the West German Institute for Labor Market
and Employment Research said the continuing influx of East Germans
and ethnic German refugees would keep unemployment high despite an
economic boom expected to bring 4 percent growth this year.
   East German immigrants have been accepting jobs spurned by
unemployed West Germans, contributing to growing problem of
long-term joblessness.

   Business executives told Congress on Monday
that President Bush's proposed increase of $500 million in spending
on Head Start is a good first step, but the administration should
fully fund the pre-school program.
   The administration is calling for $1.9 billion for Head Start in
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an increase over the $1.4 billion
appropriated last year.
   But a representative of the National Alliance of Business told a
House panel that the 25-year-old program should have enough money
to serve all eligible low-income children.
   ``To fully fund an enriched Head Start program that could serve
3-, 4- and 5-year-olds, funding by the end of the decade would be
in the range of $6 billion to $7 billion,'' said William H.
Kolberg, president of the independent, non-profit alliance.
   Frank P. Doyle, a senior vice president at General Electric and
a member of the Committee for Economic Development, stressed the
importance of early intervention programs that better prepare
low-income children for the rigors of school.
   ``We should attack the causes now rather than pay for the
consequences later,'' said Doyle, who called for not only
increasing the number of slots in the program but improving the
salaries of Head Start instructors and raising the program's
overall quality.
   Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Joint
Economic subcommittee on education and health, said Head Start was
the ``pearl of the 1960s anti-poverty program,'' and Bush realizes
that is the case.
   The president said in his budget submission for fiscal 1991,
``research shows that Head Start children experience substantial
immediate gains in cognitive growth, school readiness and
achievement.''
   But Scheuer faulted the president, saying the ``proposed funding
did not match the rhetoric.''
   The Democratic congressman noted that Bush's defense budget
includes more than $12 billion for the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the B-2 stealth bomber and moving the multiple-warhead,
MX nuclear missiles from fixed silos to railroad cars.
   ``National security doesn't seem to mean having an educational
society,'' Scheuer said.
   The congressman suggested that businesses, which spend about $30
billion to $40 billion a year training employees, might join with
state and local governments to fund Head Start programs.
   But that plan drew little support from the business executives.
   ``I'm courageous but not foolhardy,'' said Kolberg, who
emphasized that the programs should continue under government
control.
   Doyle said current training and health programs grab a major
share of his company's spending, and he was unsure whether the
funds would be available for Head Start.

   A leader of the opposition to the Marxist
government of Angola said Monday that Violeta Chamorro's victory
over leftist Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua underscores the need for
free and fair elections in his own country.
   ``At the present moment, when we see so much change all around
us, there is no considerable reason why Angola should still be
denied the right of free and fair elections,'' Jeremias Chitunda,
vice president of UNITA, said in an interview.
   Chitunda, in Washington for meetings with Bush administration
officials and members of Congress, said that the results of
Sunday's election in Nicaragua ``underscores the fact there is no
more reason why the Marxists in Angola should resist this
process,'' he said. ``Their friends have submitted to free and fair
elections in Nicaragua.''
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighing to force the government in Luanda to share power
since shortly after Angola gained its independence from Portugal in
1975.
   Bitter fighting has been reported around Mavinga, 700 miles
southeast of Luanda, since the government launched an offensive
late in December.
   UNITA receives a reported $50 million in U.S. aid a year,
including ground-to-air missiles. Angolan government troops use
Soviet weapons.
   Chitunda has met with Vice President Dan Quayle and State
Department officials as well as members of Congress during his
talks in Washington.
   ``The administration has been recommitted to help overcome the
existing logistical problems which the Soviets and Cubans sought to
exploit by launching the offensive,'' he said. ``We understand it
is also being observed that the administration is stressing further
on other African countries the need to resume talks on an Angolan
cease fire and for a solution.''

<TEXT>
   Legislators from the Baltics and other
independent-minded republics denounced a draft law Monday that
would let the Kremlin take over their governments by declaring a
state of emergency.
   Several deputies said the proposal is even more dangerous
because another bill on strengthening the presidency would permit
the nation's leader to declare a state of emergency on his own.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev wants the legal authority to push
through his program and halt the riots and ethnic strife that
threaten his reforms.
   Some legislators said such laws must be drawn carefully to
prevent ``a repetition of totalitarianism,'' as legislator Yuri
Afanasiev put it during Sunday's huge pro-democracy demonstration
in Moscow.
   The emergency bill is among dozens proposed in the current
two-month session. Legislators said they have no legal guarantee,
only Gorbachev's word, that peaceful demands for reform will not be
crushed.
   Under the proposed law, the Presidium, of which Gorbachev is
chairman, could suspend republican parliaments and city councils,
cancel decisions of local governments and take over an area in
cases of mass disorder.
   Tass said legislators were expected to consider on Tuesday the
bill to expand presidential powers.
   Interfax, a news service of Moscow radio, said a draft calling
for election of a president by universal, direct and equal suffrage
had been submitted to the legislature.
   Aides to Gorbachev had said earlier the first election would be
held in the Congress of People's Deputies at a meeting scheuled to
start on Tuesday. The session has been postponed indefinitely.
   Interfax said a candidate would need a majority of the popular
vote to win and the term would be five years. The president would
have broad powers, including the right to declare war.
   The contents of the bill reported by Interfax could not be
confirmed independently.
   Legislators said the emergency legislation, presented by the
Council of Ministers on Monday, was too broad.
   ``A mechanism for preventing any groundless declaration of a
state of emergency and abuse of power'' must be added, said
Estonian legislator Marju Lauristin, according to a Tass report on
the session in the Council of the Union, one of two houses of the
Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Vaidotas Antanaitis, a legislator from Lithuania, said such
powers conflict with Kremlin promises to give more autonomy to the
republics, and he demanded the draft be changed to say that their
governments must agree with the imposition of a state of emergency.
   The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have been
careful to avoid any violence that could be used as an excuse to
crack down on their strong mass movements for independence. They
have used their parliaments to pass constitutional amendments
allowing them to suspend national laws on their territories, and
Latvia and Lithuania led the union in legalizing multiple political
parties.
   But the Balts' demand for autonomy is hampered by the fact that
Azerbaijani authorities in January refused to agree to imposition
of a state of emergency in their capital of Baku, even though
rioters were killing dozens of Armenians and forcing thousands
others to flee for their lives. Gorbachev eventually ordered troops
into the city in the face of strong local resistance, and more than
200 people died in the unrest in the southern Caucasus.
   The draft allows authorities during a state of emergency to hold
troublemakers without trial for up to 30 days, ban strikes and
demonstrations, fire the directors of factories and institutions,
limit the use of communications and movements of citizens, place
people under house arrest, expel non-residents, and abolish
unregistered organizations.
   Authorities could also protect key sites and order a curfew.
   The draft law includes a clause allowing the Presidium to give
additional powers as needed to special administrative bodies of
power set up during the state of emergency.
   The Kremlin took over the local government of Nagorno-Karabakh
from the republic of Azerbaijan in January 1989 in hopes of halting
months of ethnic violence in the disputed territory occupied
largely by Armenians. But the Kremlin committee was unable to solve
the problems, and the Supreme Soviet legislature last fall ordered
the administration of the area returned to Azerbaijan.
   Since then, the entire republic of Azerbaijan, including
Nagorno-Karabakh, exploded in ethnic and nationalist violence. It
remains under a state of emergency with Soviet troops maintaining
order.
   Legislators also discussed a proposed law that would transform
the Interior Ministry troops, who have been called out to halt
ethnic violence in several republics in the last year, into a
volunteer force of professional troops. The Interior Ministry now
receives the majority of its soldiers from the Red Army draft, and
Tass said the higher salaries required would quintuple the cost of
the Interior Ministry forces.
   Reformers say an experienced force could be better trained to
halt civic strife.
   The draft also would allow Interior troops to shoot armed
opponents who refuse to drop their weapons, and anyone using combat
weapons to endanger the lives of citizens or the soldiers, Tass
said. Interior troops are barred from shooting without warning, and
officials have said this restriction is too dangerous as violence
grows.
   Legislators in the other house, the Council of Nationalities,
reviewed the latest version of a draft law delegating to the
republics more control over the economy, including the right to set
their own budgets, regulate investment and conduct foreign trade,
Tass said. The draft already has been rejected twice for leaving
too much power in the hands of Moscow bureaucrats.
   Tass quoted Valerian Advadze of Georgia as saying the republics
should be deciding which powers to delegate to the national
government, not the other way around.

<HEAD>Britain, Spain Mired on Gibraltar Sovereignty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Spain agreed Monday to extend
two treaties on criminal extradition and drug-trafficking to
include Gibraltar, but remained stuck on the problem of sovereignty
over the British colony at the southern tip of Spain.
   Spain had claimed that Britain turns a blind eye to
tobacco-smuggling, drug trafficking and money-laundering in its
2.25-square-mile colony.
   But British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said after meeting
with Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain that
Fernandez Ordonez offered ``no hard evidence'' of illegal
activities.
   Hurd told reporters Spain also was worried about Gibraltar's
emergence as an offshore financial center with 25 banks and $3
billion in deposits, according to figures provided by the local
government.
   He said he explained that what Gibraltar was doing ``was
perfectly legitimate ... provided this was done under strict
regulation as the key component, and that regulation is being
imposed by the Gibraltarian authorities.''
   In a joint statement, Britain and Spain said they agreed to
extend their 1985 extradition treaty and their 1989 treaty on the
prevention and suppression of drug-trafficking to Gibraltar.
   It said both parties expressed their ``well-known positions on
the question of sovereignty,'' an indication little headway was
made in the fifth round of talks since Britain and Spain agreed in
November 1984 to discuss sovereignty.
   Spain had to cede Gibraltar to Britain under a 1713 treaty after
losing the War of Spanish Succession and wants the limestone
landmark back.
   Hurd said Britain must respect the wishes of about 25,000
Gibraltarians who voted overwhelmingly to remain under British
control.
   ``There will never be an adavance on Gibraltar until sovereignty
is returned to Spain,'' Fernandez Ordonez said.

<HEAD>Peres Makes Rare Reference to Israeli Nuclear Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a rare public reference to the Israeli
nuclear weapons program, Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres on
Monday cited the Dimona nuclear reactor in the southern Negev
Desert as one of Israel's strategic assets.
   Israeli leaders are usually tight-lipped about Israel's nuclear
capabilities, saying only that Israel will not be the first country
to introduce nuclear weapons in the Middle East.
   Referring to Israel's strategic position Monday, Peres said:
``We have everything that a small nation can have. Tell me, are
there any other countries that produce a plane of our own, a
missile of our own, a tank of our own, a missile boat of our own?
   ``And we have something in Dimona which is called textile
industry,'' he said jokingly. Dimona is the site of Israel's
nuclear reactor.
   There have been frequent reports in the past about Israel's
nuclear capabilities, including the development of nuclear-armed
intermediate range missiles.
   Peres, leader of the center-left Labor Party, made the remarks
in a question and answer session with members of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
   In 1986, former Dimona technician Mordechai Vanunu revealed
details of Israel's nuclear program to the Sunday Times of London.
Scientists questioned by the newspaper said Vanunu's information
showed Israel possessed the world's sixth largest nuclear arsenal.
   Vanunu was seized in Italy by Israeli agents and brought to
Israel for trial. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison after
being convicted in 1988 of treason and espionage.
   A report issued in 1987 by a major Israeli research institute
said that ``Israel ... is far ahead of the Arab countries in terms
of the capacity to achieve a military nuclear capacity.''
   The report by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies said that ``Israel indeed does not possess nuclear
weapons.''
   ``On the other hand, and in view of its ongoing nuclear effort,
it has positioned itself to be capable of producing nuclear weapons
in less time than it would take an Arab country to do so,'' the
report concluded.

<HEAD>Bush Invites Soviets, Others to Global Warming Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday invited
representatives of the world's largest industrial nations,
including the Soviet Union, to a mid-April conference in Washington
on global warming and other environmental problems.
   The conference, scheduled for April 17-18, will be ``devoted to
science and economics issues'' involved in the controversy,
according to a White House statement.
   Bush, whose stance on global warming has been derided by
environmentalists as too pro-industry, had promised such a session
after his December meeting in Malta with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   About 20 nations were invited to the conference, including the
world's major industrial powers and several nations, such as
Brazil, with large land masses, aides said.
   ``The administration considers the conference a vital next step
in a joint international approach to address possible changes in
the global environment,'' the White House statement said.
   During his 1988 presidential campaign, Bush cited ``increasing
evidence'' that the earth's atmosphere was heating up because of
the so-called ``greenhouse effect'' and promised to convene a
global conference to find ways of dealing with the problem.
   More recently, however, Bush has softened his approach, saying
that the problem needs further study.
   In a speech that provoked widespread criticism from his
audience, Bush told an international conference on climatic change
earlier this month that ``our policies must be consistent with
economic growth.''
   He suggested that in some areas of the debate ``politics and
opinion have outpaced the science.''
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart said that the April
conference was an attempt to ``find some common ground'' among
scientific, environmental and economic interests and not the
envirnomental summit Bush had called for in his campaign.
   The White House statement said Bush had designated as
co-chairmen of the conference William Reilly, administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency; Michael Boskin, the chairman of
the White House Council of Economic Advisers; and Dr. D. Allan
Bromley, the president's science adviser.
   Hart said that invited nations were asked to send their leaders'
own top environmental, scientific and economic advisers to the
conference.
   The global conference Bush had advocated during his campaign
would have included both the Soviet Union and China. While the
Soviet Union is on the list of those invited to the April
gathering, China is not.
   ``We would have obvious problems in terms of inviting China
because of the current political situation,'' said a White House
aide who asked for anonymity. ``This conference is not
all-inclusive. It's just a cross section.''
   Officials from several European countries _ including Norway,
Denmark and Sweden _ have argued that enough scientific knowledge
has been accumulated about the causes of global warming to warrant
a commitment from industrial nations to at least stabilize carbon
dioxide pollution at current levels over the next decade.
   Like a greenhouse, such pollution traps heat and reflects it
back to earth, causing a warming of the atmosphere. While there is
little dispute that greenhouse gases are increasing, there remains
disagreement within the scientific community as to how severe the
warming will become and what effect it might have on the earth.

`The death...'</NOTE>

<DATELINE>RAMALLAH, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel, under pressure from
the United States and the European Community, said Monday it will
reopen Arab community colleges that had been ordered shut during
most of the Palestinian uprising.
   But the army kept a closure order on six Palestinian
universities with an enrollment of more than 22,000 students.
   In the occupied West Bank, three Arabs were shot and wounded by
Israeli troops during stone-throwing clashes in the town of
Tulkarem, Arab reports and Israel radio said.
   The most violent confrontation in the occupied territories in
three weeks occurred in the Gaza Strip, where Arab reports said
soldiers shot and wounded 28 Palestinians with lead or plastic
bullets, including 22 in Rafah.
   U.N. relief workers said 38 other Palestinians from Rafah were
treated for lesser injuries from rubber-coated metal pellets and
about 100 people sought help for tear-gas inhalation after army
helicopters sprayed the crowd.
   Some wounded were taken to nearby Khan Yunis, to Nasser
Hospital, where squads of soldiers searched for suspects, chasing
some patients through the halls, a hospital official said on
condition of anonymity.
   The Rafah clash broke out after youths defied an army curfew and
gathered at the home of a Palestinian man who died late Sunday
after being shot in the back in a confrontation with troops, Arab
reports said.
   The army confirmed at least 15 Palestinians suffered gunshot
wounds and said it was checking further. It declared the Rafah area
a closed military zone, preventing 50,000 Palestinians from leaving
the town.
   The death Sunday raised to 659 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israeli soldiers or civilians in the 26-month-old uprising
against Israel's occupation. Another 189 Palestinians have been
slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaborating with
Israeli authorities, and 43 Israelis have died.
   In Israel, meanwhile, thousands of Israeli Arabs staged a
one-day strike to protest inadequate government funding for their
town and city councils.
   The Arabs, who comprise about 17 percent of Israel's population,
are angered by the government's failure to implement an agreement
to write off about $50 million of their municipal debt.
   About 4,000 Israeli Arabs, led by four Arab members of
Parliament, marched through downtown Haifa to press their demands.
   The order allowing community colleges and vocational schools to
reopen will affect 16 West Bank schools with an enrollment of about
5,000 students, according to Shmuel Goren, coordinator for the
Israeli military government.
   But Goren, speaking in Ramllah at the military government's West
Bank headquarters, said the army did not lift its order closing six
Palestinian universities and one polytechnic center.
   All of the schools were order closed in January 1988 after the
army declared they were hotbeds of violence.
   Goren said the community and vocational colleges were reopened
``to bring about some change in the climate and feelings'' in the
territories.
   ``When we reach the conclusion that the universities will really
be a place for study, we will reopen them,'' he said.
   The European Parliament voted last month to freeze scientific
and technical cooperation with Israel until the universities are
reopened, and at least two planned Israeli-European Community
conferences have been postponed indefinitely.
   The United States criticized continued closure of the
universities in its annual human rights report last week.
   As Goren spoke with reporters, a group of Palestinian professors
and students held a separate news conference in Jerusalem to demand
the universities be reopened immediately and to ask for Western
support.
   Inam Labadi, an economics student at Bir Zeit University, said
Western nations were doing nothing while Israeli authorities
committed ``a crime against academic freedom and against the
simplest human rights.''
   Mrs. Labadi, whose husband, brother and brother-in-law have been
deported during the uprising, said the university closure ``is only
aimed at imposing ignorance on our people.''
   Gahbi Baramkeh, a Bir Zeit University vice president, said
European sanctions on scientific cooperation with Israel were ``a
highly appropriate'' response to continued closure of the
universities.

<HEAD>Record Cold Monday In The Northeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A large section of the Northeast was colder Monday than much of
Alaska, with record lows from southern Virginia into New York
state, and snow blew around the Great Lakes.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 23 degrees below zero
at Saranac Lake, N.Y., in the northern Adirondacks. Elsewhere in
the Northeast, Smethport, Pa., tumbled to 22 below zero and Wilcox,
Pa., reported 20 below.
   Record lows were 10 at downtown Atlantic City, N.J., and 9 at
the airport; 13, a tie, at Baltimore, downtown and airport; 6 below
zero at Binghamton, N.Y.; 5 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 4 below at
Hartford, Conn.; 8 at Newark, N.J.; 7, a tie, at New York City; 9
at New York's Kennedy Airport; 19, a tie, at Norfolk, Va.; 10, a
tie, at Philadelphia; and 10 below at Syracuse, N.Y.
   But at the airport at Anchorage, Alaska, the temperature was 37
near midnight and Palmer, Alaska, reached 41 during the morning.
   On Friday, Philadelphia, Boston and New York City had enjoyed
temperatures in the 60s.
   In the South, crops from North Carolina to Georgia mostly
survived Monday's below-freezing temperatures, which dipped into
the mid-teens in some places, but farmers braced for another night
of cold weather.
   ``We may have taken a minor hit,'' Dale Linvill, an agricultural
meteorologist with Clemson University, said of South Carolina's
crops. ``There may be some spotted damage, but not enough to really
worry about.''
   ``We had some damage to the peach blooms and buds, but we feel
like we'll come through OK,'' said Bill Reece, agricultural
extension director in North Carolina's Montgomery County. ``It's
the upcoming weather we're concerned about.''
   The cold and wind snapped power lines during the night in
northwestern Pennsylvania's Warren County, where Warren hit 6 below
zero, and 1,700 customers in and around North Warren were without
electricity until 6:30 a.m., said Jerry Clayton, a line foreman for
Pennsylvania Electric Co.
   Warren County schools couldn't be heated in time for morning
classes, said Transportation Director Mark Eberl said. Twenty
schools in the county were closed, affecting 7,300 students.
Schools throughout western Pennsylvania were delayed.
   Monday's cold followed a stormy weekend in which at least 20
deaths were blamed on the weather, most of them in traffic
accidents on slippery highways. In all, 13 people died in
weather-related accidents in Ohio. Another three died in Illinois,
two in Indiana and one each in Michigan and Kentucky.
   At midday Monday, snow showers, gusty wind and blowing snow
extended over eastern Upper Michigan and northern Lower Michigan,
and over north-central Wisconsin and north-central Minnesota.
   A heavy snow watch in effect through Tuesday was posted across
western Upper Michigan and northwestern Lower Michigan.
   Elsewhere, there were snow showers over south-central Kentucky.
   Freezing rain was scattered over southeastern Missouri, southern
Illinois and southwestern Indiana.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 2 above
zero at Caribou and Limestone, Maine, to 84 in Arizona at both Gila
Bend and Yuma.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega's top aides gave him
``false reports'' about the possibility of American military
action, but U.S. forces were caught off guard, too, by the strength
of the Panamanian resistance, the general who led the military
operation said Monday.
   ``In the two weeks preceeding Operation Just Cause, they never
gave him an accurate assessment'' of U.S. military activities, Army
Lt. Gen. Carl Stiner said of Noreiga's intelligence staff.
   Stiner said U.S. forces were surprised by two developments _
what proved to be poor intelligence about the power of Noriega's
so-called ``Dignity Batallions'' and stiffer-than-expected
resistance from the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   ``We didn't have the intelligence we should have had on the
Dignity Batallions,'' Stiner said. ``They were stronger and more
formidable to deal with ... because they just faded back into the
population,'' he said of the paramilitary Noriega supporters
dressed in civilian clothes and armed with automatic weapons.
   Stiner, who offered his assessment of the military operation to
reporters, said the strong resistance came because the PDF
apparently was tipped off to the operation just hours before its
start at 1 a.m. on Dec. 20.
   Stiner said he tried to move the H-hour forward in order to
maintain the surprise nature of the massive operation and minimize
the casualties. The general said he was able to advance it only by
15 minutes because of its complexity.
   More than 12,000 U.S. troops were airlifted into Panama in an
attempt to smash the Panamanian Defense Forces and seize Noriega,
who later surrendered to U.S. authorities and was brought back to
the United States to face federal drug charges.
   Stiner reported that, overall, 23 U.S. servicemen were killed
and 324 were injured.
   ``It was compromised,'' Stiner said of the operation. ``We know
it was compromised.''
   This allowed some Panamanian officers to prepare their soldiers
for the possibility of a U.S. attack, and that meant
heavier-than-expected resistance at some of the landing zones where
the airborne forces encountered live fire, the general said.
   Stiner said that at 10:00 p.m., the PDF radio networks carried
such reports as, ``They are coming, the ball game is at 1:00 in the
morning. ... Report to your units immediately and draw your weapons
and prepare to fight.''
   The general said there were several possiblities for the leak of
information, but that he had no independent confirmation what
exactly tipped off the PDF.
   Yet, the general said, the operation an unqualified success, and
so much so that the commanders ``didn't learn a single lesson''
from the endeavor.
   The three-star general said the misleading information handed
Noriega was discovered in documents captured during the December
operation, and that it was provided to Noriega by his ``key staff
... his key henchmen.''
   Stiner identified two of them as Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, the
chief of Noriega's investigations department, and Capt. Eliezer
Gaytan, chief of security.
   ``They were giving him false reports ... They were submitting
reports to him that everything was fine,'' Stiner said.
   Asked if the misleading information indicated Norieaga was being
set up by his cohorts, the general said he did not know if that was
the case.
   Stiner said he also couldn't say exactly what information
Noriega was given in the hours just prior to the operation.
   The Panamanian general was able to elude U.S. forces for days,
until he sought refuge at the Vatican Embassy.
   Stiner, who is the commanding general for the 18th Airborne
Corps at Fort Bragg, N.C., said his troops had practiced jumping
from 800 feet, but that they actually dropped into the landing
zones from 500 feet.
   With the live fire coming at them from the ground, some of the
men ``in the excitement of being shot at,'' forgot to drop their
100 pound packs ahead of them and broke their ankles because of the
heavy load.
   Stiner said commanders usually have a 6 percent injury rate in a
training mission, and the injury tally in Panama ``wasn't much more
than that.''

<HEAD>Britton Gets 25 Years for Shotgun Slayings of Family</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who pleaded guilty in the
shotgun slayings of his father, mother and 8-year-old brother was
sentenced Monday to a minimum 25 years in prison.
   Brian Britton, 17, who prosecutors claimed had a fascination
with the ``Rambo'' movie character portrayed by actor Sylvester
Stallone, showed no emotion when sentenced to 25-years-to-life
imprisonment on each of the second-degree murder counts.
   Britton, who pleaded guilty Jan. 3, also was sentenced to serve
between 8 1-3 to 25 years for the attempted murder of his sister
during the March 1989 rampage at the family's home in Poughkeepsie.
   Judge Judith Hillery ordered the sentences to run concurrently.
Under New York state law, Britton must serve all of his minimum
sentence.
   Hillery rejected a plea for leniency from public defender John
Garrity Jr., who argued that Britton had been abused at home by an
alcoholic father and an overbearing mother. Garrity claimed that
Britton had suffered cracked ribs and a broken nose as the result
of confrontations with his father.
   Pamela Sackett of the Dutchess County Coalition Against Child
Abuse said she was disappointed the sentence was not reduced,
saying it was ``very clear child abuse played a significant role''
in the slayings.
   Assistant Dutchess County District Attorney Thomas Dolan said
there was no reason for the slayings other than the ``outrageous
rage of a young man.'' He called Britton a calculating killer.
   Britton gave ``Rambo'' as his nickname when booked by
authorities after the shootings. Prosecutors claimed he was
fascinated with the gun-toting Vietnam veteran in the ``Rambo''
movie series, and also kept a range of military paraphernalia in
the house, including Army fatigues, canteens and ``Soldier of
Fortune'' magazines.
   Garrity argued that Britton had been forced by his father to
watch violent shows on television, especially about war.

   President Bush offered high praise Monday to
the nation's governors for their work on education and pledged to
keep the subject ``in the forefront of America's agenda.'' But some
governors emerged from the White House meeting complaining that the
president didn't back his words with money.
   ``He seemed unaccountably reluctant to make any commitments,''
said Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio, chairman of the Democratic
Governors' Association.
   Bush met with the governors the day after the state officials
adopted six education goals that followed closely those outlined by
the president in his State of the Union speech last month.
   ``We are launching a new era in education reform,'' said Bush.
``Its focus, high expectations; its hallmark, results.''
   Bush told the governors gathered in the East Room that ``for the
first time in America's history we now have national education
goals and objectives _ goals that pave the way to a decade-long
commitment to excellence in education for all Americans, goals that
will guide us on the journey toward an American renaissance in
education.''
   In a private luncheon with the governors Bush hinted that there
may be some resources available in coming years to address the
education goals. According to Massachusetts Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis, the vanquished Democrat in the 1988 presidential election,
Bush said defense spending may be cut further.
   With communism seemingly in retreat around the world, several of
the governors asked Bush who was the enemy, Dukakis said. ``He
said, `The enemy is instability.' OK, fine. But then he said,
`Look, we've already cut the defense budget substantially below
projected levels,' and he said `It's probably going to be cut even
futher.'''
   Bush thanked the governors for their ``superb cooperation'' in
the effort that began last fall at an education summit in
Charlottesville, Va. The president and the governors agreed that
adoption of the goals for improving American education over the
next decade was only the beginning of a difficult process.
   ``We all expect that there's a lot of work ahead of us,'' said
Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, chairman of the National Governors'
Association.
   Adoption of the goals was the top item on the agenda of the
NGA's annual midwinter meeting. The four day conference ends
Tuesday.
   The goals call for giving poor children pre-school services that
include nutrition and health screening and making sure American
students are competent in math, science, English, history and
geography. They also call for increasing adult literacy and making
schools drug-free.
   Attached to the goals was a document seeking a commitment ``to
provide at least one year of pre-school for all disadvantaged
children.'' It also said, ``federal funds should target those
students most in need of assistance due to economic disadvantage or
risk of academic failure.''
   In the budget he sent Congress this year, Bush proposed a $500
million increase in federal funds for the pre-school Head Start
program.
   But when governors asked at the White House about funds for
other educational programs, the president offered no encouragement.
   ``To the extent that the federal government doesn't propose more
funds, they (the goals) may not be reachable,'' said Gov. L.
Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
   Republican Gov. James Thompson of Illinois backed the
president's reluctance to offer a greater federal commitment.
   ``The money is going to come primarily from states and local
governments and that's where it should come from,'' said Thompson.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell of South Carolina, who was co-chairman of
the governors' education task force, noted that the federal
government pays only about 7 percent of the cost of public schools.
   ``We're going to have to carry the bulk of this, we and the
local communities,'' said the South Carolina Republican.
   ``We're not looking for change in that ratio,'' said Roger
Porter, White House domestic affairs adviser, referring to the 7
percent federal share.
   The governors also adopted a resolution urging the president to
consider education among the areas that might get additional funds
from any ``peace dividend,'' or reduction in defense spending
because of reduced international tensions.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York said that resolution was ``an
acknowledgement _ not as bold a commitment as a lot of us would
want _ but at least an acknowledgement that there is a federal role
of some kind when it comes to revenue.''
   ``I don't think the White House is prepared to offer the
governors any more in the way of funds than are in the budget,''
said Celeste. ``I am a little disappointed.''
   Bush pledged to ``do everything I can to provide the national
leadership and energy to keep education in the forefront of
America's domestic agenda.''

<HEAD>States Sign Compact to Cooperate on Air Pollution</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Clean Air, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governors of six mid-Atlantic states,
saying pollution knows no boundaries, signed a regional compact
Monday to develop consistent clean-air standards and cooperate in
monitoring air pollution.
   ``The updating of the Clean Air Act is taking entirely too
long,'' New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio said, ``and therefore what this
represents is our recognition that to protect the health of our
constituents we can't wait for somebody to get around to upgrading
the Clean Air Act.''
   The Mid-Atlantic Region Air Management Agreement was signed by
the governors of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as the city of Philadelphia,
Allegheny County, Pa., and the District of Columbia.
   ``This is a good initiative,'' said Maryland Gov. William Donald
Schaefer. ``The regulations in one state should be as similar as
possible to those in the next state.''
   Representatives of each state will meet Tuesday to begin
deciding how to develop consistent policies on acid rain as well as
on emissions of ozone, toxic chemicals and volatile organic
chemicals that send vapors into the air.
   Already, Delaware, Maryland and New Jersey have laws restricting
the vapors emitted by gasoline. Similar legislation is pending in
Pennsylvania and Philadelphia, according to Phillip Retallnick,
director of Delaware's Division of Air and Waste Management.
   Schaefer suggested the idea of regional cooperation could be
extended to other environmental issues. He said mid-Atlantic
governors might join forces on plastics recycling, while Virginia
Gov. Douglas Wilder said he could foresee them acting together to
solve problems of solid-waste disposal.

   The U.S. Southern Command Monday
identified eight of nine people killed when a military helicopter
crashed last week in a thunderstorm in a jungle.
   The helicopter and a second one crashed Wednesday while on a
training flight near Punta Diego, about 50 miles southwest of
Colon, on the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal.
   The Southern Command disclosed the names of the two men on the
second helicopter on Friday.
   It issued a news release Monday that identified three of the
four crew members on the first helicopter, a UH-1H, as 1st Warrant
Officers Vincent Gibson and Richard Block, and Spec. Joel L.
Meints. It said the name of the fourth was being withheld until
relatives were notified.
   All four belonged to Company B, 1st Battalion, of U.S. Army
South's 228 Airborne Regiment in Panama.
   The five passengers aboard were identified as Sgts. Sidney T.
Dew and Antonio B. Solis, Specs. Rodney L. Blodgett and Kirk M.
Magill and Pvt. 2 Charles D. Allison.
   They were members of Company B, 3rd Battalion, 17th Infantry,
7th Light Infantry Division, with headquarters at Fort Ord, Calif,
according to the news release.
   The Southern Command did not disclose the ages or hometowns of
any of the men.
   Those killed on the second helicopter, an OH-58 observation
aircraft, were Capt. Richard D. Tyndall and Warrant Officer James
W. Carl, the pilot.
   Carl was assigned to the Panamanian company and Tyndall to the
Fort Ord company.
   The helicopters, based in Fort Kobbe, belonged to the Panamanian
company.
   The Southern Command said last week that the crashes are under
investigation but that sabotage was not suspected.

<HEAD>Five Rebels Killed in Peru; Slogans Painted on Incan Ruins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police killed five pro-Cuban guerrillas in the
central highlands, and rebels belonging to the fanatical Shining
Path movement painted red anti-government threats Monday on Inca
ruins above Cuzco, authorities said.
   A police patrol clashed Sunday evening with a column of rebels
belonging to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement near Jauja, 100
miles east of Lima, killing five guerrillas while suffering no
police casualties, police said.
   In Cuzco, 355 miles southeast of Lima, fighters of the Maoist
Shining Path daubed threats on the huge stone walls of
Sacsayhuaman, an Inca fortress on a hill overlooking the city,
which is a popular tourist site.
   Police said about 15 hooded rebels tied up the two guards at the
ruins before dawn Monday and then used red paint to write warnings
against voting in presidential and general elections set for April
8.
   The signs also said, ``Long live President Gonzalo,'' the name
used by Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman.
   On Feb. 8, the body of an American tourist shot in the head was
found near the ruins, and police have not determined whether he was
killed by thieves or Shining Path guerrillas.
   Shining Path rebels murdered seven foreign tourists last year in
different parts of the highlands. But Cuzco had been relatively
free of terrorism.
   The government extended for 60 days on Monday a state of
emergency in a third of the nation, giving the military broad
powers to fight leftist guerrillas.
   The measure affects eight departments _ Apurimac, Ayacucho,
Huancavelica, Junin, Pasco, Huanuco, San Martin and Ucayali _ and
one province, Ucayali in Loreto department. Peru is divided into 24
departments, which are subdivided into provinces.
   The areas are in the central and southern highlands and northern
jungle.
   The state of emergency puts the areas under military control and
suspends individual rights such as unrestricted travel, protection
against arrest without a judicial order and prohibition against
violation of residences without search warrants.
   Lima, Peru's capital and home to a third of its 22 million
people, also is under a state of emergency, but it is administered
by the national police.
   Political violence unleashed by the Shining Path in 1980 has
killed more than 17,500 people.
   The government imposed the state of emergency for the first time
in December 1982 in Ayacucho, birthplace of the rebel movement.
   Since then the measure has been steadily extended to other areas
as rebel violence has expanded.

<HEAD>Researchers Narrow Search For Gene For Hereditary Blindness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have approximately located the gene
responsible for an inherited disorder that causes eye disease and
hearing impairment, a discovery they hope will lead them to the
ailment's cause and treatment.
   Defects in the gene cause a disease called Type II Usher
syndrome, which is marked by retinitis pigmentosa and moderate
hearing impairment, according to an announcement Monday by the
National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation in Baltimore.
   The foundation said the disorder afflicts an estimated 10,000
Americans.
   ``This finding represents the first localization of a gene
associated with congenital hearing loss and is a significant
advance in the molecular genetics of RP,'' said Dr. Alan Laties,
chairman of the retinitis pigmentosa foundation's scientific
advisory board.
   The discovery follows by less than a month the announcement that
researchers had identified a genetic defect associated with another
form of retinitis pigmentosa, the so-called autosomal dominant
form. That form is not accompanied by hearing loss.
   The team that made the discovery was led by William Kimberling,
director of the Center for Hereditary Communication Disorders at
Boys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, Neb.
   The gene was found to be located on the long arm of chromosome
1, one of the 23 chromosomes that carry human hereditary
characteristics.
   Retinitis pigmentosa is an inherited disease that afflicts about
100,000 Americans. It begins with night blindness and gradually
progresses to tunnel vision and total blindness. These symptoms are
caused by degeneration of the retina.
   The cause of this degeneration is unknown. But with the
discovery of genes that trigger it, researchers can begin to
unravel the biochemical process that leads to the degeneration.
They can then use that knowledge to try to develop drugs or other
treatments to counteract or prevent degeneration.

   Tugboats towed the burning Kuwaiti tanker
Surf City, which exploded last week, out of the Persian Gulf toward
the Indian Ocean on Monday.
   Several salvage tugs and at least one U.S. Navy warship
accompanied the 81,283-ton vessel on a 10-hour transit of the
Strait of Hormuz, gateway to the gulf, military and shipping
industry sources reported. The tanker was imperiled by a resurgence
of fires fed by leaks from its weakened cargo tanks.
   Officials said the Surf City was taken out of the gulf to avoid
the possibility of another explosion sinking it in busy shipping
lanes or causing damage to terminal facilities off the United Arab
Emirates.
   The Surf City was one of 11 Kuwait-owned tankers reflagged by
the United States in 1987 so the Navy could protect them from
attack in the Iran-Iraq war.
   A Gulf-based shipping executive, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said salvage tugs were spraying foam and water on the
tanker as it was towed out.
   He said a southerly wind was helping cool the ship, but also
would slow its progress.
   The explosion on Thursday killed the American captain and first
mate and forced the other 23 crewmen _ all Americans but one _ to
abandon ship. They were rescued by the missile frigate USS Simpson,
patrolling nearby.
   All were flown home later except boatswain Earl Washington, 41,
of Louisiana, who remains in a Dubai hospital with burns. His
hometown was not immediately known.
   Until the towing began, the tanker had remained off the Emirates
while up to a dozen salvage tugs tried to contain the fires.

   The father of 7-year-old Hilary
Foretich, whose mother went to jail for 25 months rather than
disclose her whereabouts, said Monday that he had come to rescue
his daughter.
   ``My daughter deserves to come back and have a normal life,''
said Dr. Eric Foretich, 45, as he arrived in Auckland.
   The mother, Dr. Jean Elizabeth Morgan, who claims her ex-husband
sexually abused the child, accused him of hunting down their
daughter like ``an animal.''
   Foretich denies he abused the child. Last week, the Falls
Church, Va., dental surgeon traced his daughter to New Zealand,
where she has been living with her maternal grandparents.
   Hilary reportedly hasn't seen either of her parents in two years.
   ``Certainly we're going to do what we need to do to rescue my
daughter,'' Foretich said. He met with his New Zealand lawyers
immediately upon his arrival.
   Morgan was released from jail in September after Congress passed
a law tailored for her that limited civil contempt imprisonment in
Washington, D.C., to a year.
   Aided by private investigators, Foretich found that Hilary was
living in the South Island town of Christchurch, 190 miles
southwest of Wellington.
   The Family Court in Christchurch granted an interim order Friday
giving the grandparents custody of the girl, and on Monday William
Morgan, the child's grandfather, vowed to call police if the father
approached the girl.
   Hilary spoke to her mother for the first time in two years
Sunday and cried, said Antonia Morgan, her maternal grandmother.
   Morgan, a 42-year-old plastic surgeon in Washington, was jailed
in August 1987 for refusing to say where her daughter was despite a
U.S. judge's ruling for the former husband's unsupervised access.
   The couple separated before Hilary was born.
   In an interview from the United States, Morgan accused her
ex-husband of seeking publicity and said: ``He has hunted her down
like an animal. She does not want to see him, and he knows that.''
   Morgan's attorney, Stephen Sachs, filed papers in Washington,
D.C., Monday asking Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon to return
her passport so she can travel to New Zealand. She was forced to
hand over the passport during the custody battle.
   ``By continuing to withhold Dr. Morgan's passport, this court is
effectively preventing Dr. Morgan from appearing in the New Zealand
proceeding to defend her interests and from responding to the
request of Hilary's court-appointed counsel that she participate in
those proceedings,'' the motion said.
   Dixon, who jailed Morgan in 1987, has scheduled a hearing for
Tuesday morning. However, the passport is in the custody of the
D.C. Court of Appeals, due to another ruling in the protracted
case. Officials indicated that Dixon could suggest to the appeals
court that the passport be returned.
   New Zealand's prime minister, Geoffrey Palmer, noting intense
U.S. media interest in the case, said it was for the family court
in Christchurch, not his Labor government, to rule on the matter.
   ``The paramount consideration in those cases is one issue: the
welfare of the child,'' Palmer said.
   Hilary has spent the past two years in Christchurch, a famous
cathedral town that is the staging post for ``Operation
Deepfreeze,'' as the U.S. activities in Antarctica are called.
   Opposition National Party member Philip Burdon, voicing sympathy
for the girl's mother, said that she chose to hide her daughter in
New Zealand because it had a respected legal system and was an
English-speaking country that the grandfather had visited before.
   ``We are not dealing with crackpots here,'' Burdon said. ``I
have little sympathy for the motivations of the father who had
already separated from of the mother of his child before she was
born.''

   Many government food products are unfit
for needy Indians who rely on them to survive, a congressional
committee was told Monday as it examined smelly, unappetizing cans
of meat.
   ``I'm not sure that I'd give this to a dog,'' Rep. Tony Hall,
D-Ohio, said after examining the cans of beef and pork stamped
``USDA approved'' from food packages the government distributes
through Indian tribes.
   Charles ``Red'' Gates, the food distribution program director
for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, told the U.S. House Select
Committee on Hunger the meats not only contain lard and animal
veins, but also are loaded with fat and sodium.
   That compounds the unusually high rates of diabetes, heart
disease, hypertension and infant mortality rates on North Dakota
Indian reservations, Gates, tribal officials and reservation
residents said.
   It was the first time the USDA had heard such complaints about
its meat commodities, said USDA spokeswoman Darlene Barnes. Beef
and pork commodity products must meet certain specifications and
are limited to 1 percent sodium and 1 percent fat, she said.
   Among the 100 people attending the congressional hearing at the
tribal council headquarters on south-central North Dakota
reservation was Diane Ponga, 38, a speech aide for the school
district.
   She told the committee that she and her husband, who suffers
from high blood pressure, depend on commodity foods to feed their
six children and two nieces. She said the children range in age
from 6 to 19.
   ``But I don't let the kids see it, or they won't eat it,'' Ponga
said, referring to the canned meat.
   Tribal officials asked the committee to push for higher
nutritional and quality standards for commodity foods to ease the
persistent health problems on the reservation.
   ``It's imperative the food provided doesn't contribute to health
problems,'' said Twila Martin-Kekahbah, chairwoman of the Turtle
Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.
   Terrence Sloan, director for the Aberdeen Area Indian Health
Service that serves North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa,
said health and nutrition problems are disproportionately higher on
the Standing Rock reservation than anywhere else in the nation.
   The tribe includes 2.3 million acres in Sioux County of North
Dakota and Corson County in South Dakota. Its enrolled population
was 10,300 in January 1989.
   Deaths from heart disease on the reservation from 1984 through
1986 totaled 243 per 100,000 people, compared with 181 for all
races in the United States, Sloan said. An infant mortality rate of
19 per 1,000 live births was nearly double the nationwide average,
he said.
   Indians also have one of the highest diabetes rates worldwide,
Sloan said.
   ``These problems will accelerate unless changes are made in
nutrition and fitness programs on the reservation,'' he said.
   He suggested making fresh fruit and vegetables available through
the commodity distribution program, providing delivery of food to
the elderly and handicapped, implementing information programs on
nutrition and food preparation, and reducing fat, salt and sodium
in food items.
   Sloan also urged that income guidelines for the food stamp
program be revised.
   A recent General Accounting Office study of four reservations,
including Fort Berthold in North Dakota and Pine Ridge in South
Dakota, showed some Indians cannot qualify for food stamps because
their cars are worth more than $4,500. The $4,500 limit was set in
1978.
   Grocers also raise their prices on the days they know food
stamps are being issued, the GAO found.
   Hall and Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said they would support
legislation to improve government nutrition programs.
   ``It's disgusting,'' Dorgan said. ``We've got to do better than
this.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former congressional official who had been
the Bush administration's leading candidate for chief regulator of
the nation's savings institutions said Monday he has withdrawn his
name from consideration.
   Frederick D. Wolf, formerly the No. 2 official at the General
Accounting Office, said he informed the Treasury Department last
week he is no longer interested in being appointed director of the
department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Wolf, a partner with the Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. accounting firm,
said Treasury officials in late December asked him to apply for the
job.
   Subsequently, administration, congressional and industry sources
said Wolf was the most likely candidate to succeed M. Danny Wall,
who announced his resignation on Dec. 4 but continues to serve.
   Wolf said he was disturbed that two months after being asked to
consider the job, Treasury officials had still not recommended his
name to the White House.
   He said he could only conclude that either the administration
did not believe it was important to fill the job soon or did not
favor his appointment.
   In the meantime, Wolf said he was forced to suspend work for
several of his firm's clients in order to avoid a potential
conflict of interest.
   The inability of the administration to decide on Wall's
replacement, nearly three months after he quit, was taken by
analysts as another sign of disarray in the management of the
savings and loan bailout.
   Last month, Daniel Kearney, alluding to differences with the
Treasury Department, resigned as the chief staff officer of the
Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board. The board sets the policy
and controls the purse strings of the bailout.
   ``I think this withdrawal is another black eye coming on top of
Kearney's resignation,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``It is bumbling.''
   The failure to fill the post also likely will bolster the
arguments of members of Congress, including House Banking Committee
members Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who
want to abolish the thrift office and divide its duties among
commercial bank regulatory agencies.
   Wall, who had been under fire from Congress for his handling of
the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif., said he would like to leave the post soon.
   ``I have indicated that is my wish, but there's no date been set
at this point,'' he said. ``I haven't put any deadlines down.''
   Wall said Treasury is exploring the appointment of Jonathan
Fiechter, currently the office's senior deputy director, as acting
director.
   However, in a letter to President Bush, the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions said the appointment of an acting director
could leave the institution rudderless.
   It said its reading of last summer's S&amp;L legislation does not
leave its lawyers confident that an acting director, without Senate
confirmation, could legally close failed S&amp;Ls, issue rules or
exercise the other powers of the director's office.
   Art Siddon, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, had no
comment on the trade group's contention.

   NASA will wait until Wednesday for
the sixth attempt to launch shuttle Atlantis on an undercover
military mission, but weather may again interfere.
   Forecasters said there was only a 40 percent chance the weather
would be favorable at launch time, expected about 12:45 a.m.
   The problem, they said, would be high winds and clouds, the
forces that combined early Monday to halt the latest effort to put
what sources said was a $500 million spy satellite in orbit.
   The outlook remains the same on Thursday.
   After Monday's scrub, the fifth in five days, shuttle managers
decided to wait two days so that the five military astronauts and
launch team could rest.
   ``We've got a 48-hour turnaround, and it's going to give us all
a chance to get some rest,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
   The astronauts were making use of the break to fly back to
Houston to use training facilities at the Johnson Space Center.
They were due back by noontime Tuesday.
   The crew includes Navy Capt. John O. Creighton, the commander;
Air Force John H. Casper, the pilot; Marine Lt. Col. David C.
Hilmers, the flight engineer; and mission specialists Air Force
Col. Richard Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   ``We are disappointed we didn't launch, but are convinced that
the launch team and the mission management team made the correct
decision,'' Creighton said in a statement. ``We are looking forward
to our next opportunity.''
   The astronauts boarded Atlantis about 2{ hours before Monday's
scheduled 12:54 a.m. liftoff. The countdown was put on hold, but a
break in the weather never came and at 2:32 a.m. the launch was
abandoned.
   Sunday's liftoff was halted by a computer problem with 31
seconds to go. The two previous launches were delayed due to
weather, while the first attempt, on Thursday, was scrubbed because
Creighton had a cold.
   So far, the delays have cost the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration $2.75 million in fuel, labor and materials.
   The mission is nearing a record for postponements due to weather
and mechanical problems.
   Columbia was launched Jan. 12, 1986, after six such delays.
Challenger, launched 16 days later on the ill-fated flight that
killed its seven astronauts, also had been delayed six times, but
only three of those came during countdown. The others were the
result of Columbia's delays.
   Because Atlantis' flight is a classified military mission, NASA
is withholding details surrounding the length and purpose of the
flight.
   However, sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Atlantis' cargo is a $500 million spy satellite capable of taking
high-resolution reconnaissance photos and listening in on
electronics communications all over the world.
   The mission is to be the sixth classified military flight of 34
shuttle missions.

   President Bush on Friday named Illinois Gov.
James R. Thompson Jr. to be chairman of the Intelligence Oversight
Board, a watchdog panel that keeps tabs on the government's
intelligence services.
   Thompson succeeds W. Glenn Campbell.
   Bush also named Amos A. Jordan Jr. to the panel. He is vice
chairman of the board of trustees at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. Jordan replaces Charles
Tyroler II.
   The three-member panel was set up in 1981 to review U.S.
intelligence activities and agency guidelines, and to report to the
president and the attorney general whenever any practices are
detected which might violate law.
   The third member of the panel is Michael W. McConnell.

   Fed up with war and poverty and
liberated by a secret ballot, Nicaraguans unceremoniously dumped
the ruling Sandinista party as soon as they had the chance.
   The Sandinistas lost, and lost big, despite their tight
organization and militant workers; despite plastering Managua and
the country with ``Daniel Presidente'' T-shirts, baseball caps and
posters; despite a campaign that spent $7 million in a media-poor
country, despite polls that showed 15-point leads.
   ``I think when people went to the polls, they voted with their
stomachs. And I think they thought about the empty stomachs of
their children,'' said Paul Reichler, an American lawyer and close
adviser to President Daniel Ortega.
   The Sandinistas blamed their economic problems largely on the
United States, and the United States certainly did its worst: it
sponsored a guerrilla war and imposed an economic embargo.
   But in the end, the excuses didn't matter: people wanted a
change.
   ``They had 10 years and could not do it,'' was the slogan of the
jury-rigged opposition coalition led by newspaper publisher Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro.
   She hammered away at the Sandinistas for their dogmatic,
Marxist-oriented policies and state-controlled economy.
   It was a shocking fall for the young revolutionaries who entered
Managua as heroes on July 19, 1979, after toppling the 45-year
Somoza dynasty.
   But then they began to antagonize the church, restrict civil
liberties, muzzle news media and install a generally repressive
regime that critics said was a copy of the Cuban system.
Nicaraguans fled their country by the hundreds of thousands.
   Some compared Sandinista experiments to those of children who
just got a set of toy trains for Christmas.
   The Sandinistas eventually tried to change, admitting errors,
promising a new mixed-market economic system, freeing the press and
making possible the freest election in Nicaraguan history.
   But with an economy in shambles, a costly war that killed more
than 60,000 people and the prospect of more poverty as its Eastern
European allied regimes crumbled, the Sandinistas were left
vulnerable to an electorate that ``lost its fear,'' in the words of
a Sandinista journalist.
   ``It is to their credit that they created the atmosphere for a
clean election,'' said truck driver Ramon Mendoza as he came out of
a polling booth where there were no soldiers or other symbols of
intimidation.
   ``But I could not vote for the Frente (the Sandinistas). A vote
for the Sandinistas would mean that I am voting for higher
inflation, for things to be more expensive every day, for my
children to be drafted into the army and sent to war.''
   ``We did not vote for Violeta,'' he added, referring also to his
wife's vote. ``We voted for a change.''
   ``We did not have the best candidate and we did not run the best
campaign,'' said a close adviser to Mrs. Chamorro, the newspaper
publisher who was a symbol more than a leader of an opposition
coalition that included parties from the extreme right to the
extreme left.
   ``I think they overestimated themselves,'' said Luis Guzman,
leader of a Social Christian faction in the opposition coalition.
   ``They thought they could go for a plebiscite and win; Pinochet
made the same mistake. They decided to run the risk. Now their only
option is to accept what happened.''
   The reference was to lame-duck President Augusto Pinochet of
Chile.
   The Sandinistas, in another example of growing maturity as a
party, appear to have accepted their fate.
   Some of their own foes thought it was sad the Sandinistas got
the boot from an irate populace ``with short memory'' of the
contributions the Sandinistas made in getting rid of dictator
Anastasio Somoza and in the areas of health and education.
   ``We thought it would have been better to try to change the
Sandinistas from within,'' said Mauricio Diaz, vice president of
the Social Christian Party.
   ``People identified the problems with the Sandinistas. They do
not think that part of the problem was caused by the United
States.''
   The Sandinistas remain the largest single party in the National
Assembly and still control many labor unions, making them an
important political force.
   The army is known as the Sandinista Army and is closely
identified with the party.
   ``The new government will have to deal with the army very
carefully,'' said Social Christian presidential nominee Erick
Ramirez, a clear loser in this election because he gambled on
staying out of the United National Opposition coalition that he
thought would fall apart.
   The army is commanded by Gen. Humberto Ortega, Daniel Ortega's
brother.
   Many of the Sandinistas' achievements have left a deep imprint
in Nicaraguan history. They confiscated land as part of agrarian
reform and distributed it to landless peasants, formed farming
cooperatives, organized a giant literacy campaign, and improved
public medical services.
   But their economic policies and their confrontation with
Washington forced them eventually into regional isolation.
   The United States financed the Contra rebels that at one time
numbered 15,000 and the Sandinistas had to raise an army to fight
them.
   ``If we had to make some changes, we would change some of the
economic policies of the past 10 years,'' campaign manager and
Sandinista Directorate member Bayardo Arce told journalsits three
days before the election.
   The Sandinistas obviously thought they would win, buoyed by
polls and a tremendous final rally that drew 300,000 people.
   But Nicaraguans were afraid to tell pollsters the truth and the
rallies were packed by government employees and labor unionists who
felt compelled to attend.
   In the secrecy of a voting booth that the Sandinistas themselves
arranged, all that changed.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Election Hailed as Victory for Democracy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Nicaragua, Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nicaraguan elections were hailed worldwide Monday as a model
of democracy and a step toward peace in a country that has been
mired in civil war for a decade.
   Hundreds of international observers monitored the campaign and
the Sunday balloting, in which opposition candidate Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro defeated incumbent Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar welcomed the
Nicaraguan elections as a ``victory for democracy'' throughout
Central America. He said he supported the process but remained
neutral on the outcome.
   Honduras said Mrs. Chamorro's victory would pave the way for
improved relations. Nicaragua and Honduras have quarreled over
U.S.-backed Contra rebel bases in Honduras.
   The United States, the Contras and others called for national
reconciliation and a peaceful transition of power.
   But Nicaraguans living in the United States doubted the leftist
Sandinista leadership would give up power easily, and European
socialists blamed external forces for Ortega's defeat.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass carried a brief news story
out of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, headlined: ``Opposition
Leader Wins Elections in Nicaragua.'' There was no other Soviet
reaction initially.
   U.S. officials welcomed the result and began meetings to review
policy on Nicaragua. Besides aiding the rebels, the United States
imposed an economic embargo to undermine Nicaragua's economy.
   President Bush said he spoke with President Carlos Andres Perez
of Venezuela about ``appropriate trade and economic measures that
we can take to support the new government of Nicaragua.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was sending
messages to Mrs. Chamorro, congratulating her on her win, and to
Ortega, ``congratulating him on the conduct of the election and his
stated willingness to abide by the results.''
   Aristides Sanchez, a Contra leader, said all Nicaraguans now
must work for national reconciliation.
   ``Because of the international observers and attention, this
triumph has to be recognized by the Sandinists and by all
Nicaraguans,'' he said. ``It is the first step to achieving a true
democracy.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter, invited to monitor the balloting,
praised Ortega for holding free and fair elections.
   ``They had total control over the government, over the electoral
process,'' Carter told ABC television. ``I think Ortega can go out
of office in April ... with a great deal of satisfaction that he
has indeed been instrumental in letting the people exhibit
democracy and freedom in one of its finest ways in this
hemisphere.''
   Carter said Ortega promised to abide by the results.
   But Nicaraguan U.S. residents said they feared the army would
reject the vote.
   ``The results were good, but it's a lie,'' said Barbara Zapata,
26, who left Managua five months ago. ``Daniel (Ortega) will not
turn in the weapons.''
   Edgar Toruno Raudales, 27, said an opposition government was
worthless if the army remains in control of the Sandinistas.
   ``There could be a coup at any time,'' he said.
   World leaders called for a peaceful transition of power.
   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras told a news
conference he would ``establish appropriate mechanisms to achieve a
concrete rapprochement with Nicaragua.''
   Argentine President Carlos Menem said the election strengthened
democracy throughout Central America.
   Chile said it would recognize Mrs. Chamorro's victory by
inviting her to attend the inauguration next month of its new
president, Patricio Aylwin. Ortega had been invited as Nicaragua's
head of state.
   Former President Ronald Reagan, who spearheaded anti-Sandinista
policy and support for the Contra rebels, asked that the fighting
end.
   ``Now is the time for all parties to put down their weapons and
join in a common pursuit of what is in the best interests of the
Nicaraguan people,'' Reagan said.
   Pierre Guidoni of France's Socialist Party blamed Reagan
policies during the 1980s for the Sandinista defeat, saying:
   ``The Sandinistas had to concentrate their efforts on national
defense against armed aggression supported by the United States.
They paid today by the ruination of their social project that a war
economy could not support.''

   In the end President Daniel Ortega
lost the votes and won the hearts as observers, opposition leaders
and Nicaraguans praised his gallant acceptance of defeat.
   ``It was a noble attitude, honest and genuine,'' said Joao Baena
Soares, secretary general of the Organization of American States.
   Baena Soares also praised the Sandinista president for making it
possible for the country to hold a ``clean demcoratic election in a
peaceful atmosphere.''
   ``It was a responsible attitude,'' said Mauricio Diaz, leader of
the Social Christian party. ``He accepted reality. The Sandinistas
defeated the Contra militarily, but they could not defeat the
economic crisis.''
   Edgar Isaac Aguirre, a taxi driver who never liked the
Sandinsitas, said of Ortega: ``It was an honorable attitude on his
part, the best thing he has done in 10 years of government.''
   Hundreds of reporters, international pro-Sandinista solidarity
workers and Nicaraguan supporters gathered at the Olaf Palme
convention center through the night awaiting definitive elections
results.
   When Ortega arrived shortly after 6 a.m. to concede defeat, many
wept.
   At the end, tears sparkled in his eyes and his wife, Rosario
Murillo, hugged him from behind and kissed his cheek.
   But with a stoicism that marked a dignified and reflective
speech resembling nothing more than a valedictory, Ortega held back
the tears.
   The former guerrilla leader whose brother was killed during the
insurrection against dictator Anastasio Somoza said quietly, but
firmly: ``The president of Nicaragua, the government, will respect
and submit itself to the popular mandate that arose from the vote
in these elections.''
   ``I believe that in this historic moment the principal
contribution we Sandinistas, we Nicaraguan revolutionaries, can
make to the Nicaragua people is the guarantee of a pure and clean
electoral process, which warms our consciences,'' Ortega said.
   ``Would that this sun rising this 26th of February illuminate
the path toward the consolidation of democracy, of a mixed economy,
of a free Nicaragua independent and democratic, in peace, not
interfered with by any foreign power, in which all Nicaraguans
would be able to demonstrate to the world that we can make these
dreams and hopes come true.''
   It was a moment of grace deeply appreciated by listeners and
followers in a country of guerrilla bravado and a region not used
to graceful acceptance of electoral defeats.
   Only last year, in neighboring Panama the military regime of
Manuel Antonio Noriega annulled a presidential election because its
candidate had lost it.
   ``We must recognize Daniel's gesture,'' said Agustin Jarquin, a
member of the executive committee of the political council of the
United National Opposition, whose candidate, Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro, won the election.
   ``The Sandinistas must orient their followers so we can achieve
national reconciliation.''
   While there were words of praise and thanks for his companions
in the Sandinista government, he did not speak of his own political
future or the party's future _ whether there would be an attempt at
reconciliation or a clash.
   Nor did he mention the United States and its long record of
hostility, except as a sidelight and object of Sandinista struggle.
   He and his colleagues, many with clenched fists raised, withdrew
from the hall to the strains of the Sandinista hymn and the refrain
``Free fatherland, victory or death.''

<HEAD>Fistfight Breaks Out In Taiwan's National Assembly</HEAD>

   A brawl broke out in the electoral college
on Monday _the third in eight days _ when opposition members
challenged the qualifications of some elderly colleagues from the
governing Nationalist Party.
   The protests are over the domination of the electoral college,
known as the National Assembly, and the Legislature by aging
Nationalists.
   On Monday, Huang Chao-hui of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party pushed fellow Assemblyman Hsiung Chi-ho, 76, and
threatened to throw him out of the meeting.
   Nationalist Assemblyman Lee Hua-yang grabbed Huang's necktie.
Huang punched back and the two rolled on the floor as others joined
the pushing and shouting.
   The 752-seat National Assembly includes 646 members who last ran
for office on the Chinese mainland shortly before 1949, when they
fled here with the rest of the Nationalist government after it lost
a civil war to Communist forces.
   Most of the senior members were runners-up in the mainland
elections but filled seats vacated by the death of the original
winner. They have not faced re-election in Taiwan because the
Nationalists claim to still be the legitimate government of all
China.
   Opposition Assemblyman Tsai Shih-yuan challenged the
qualifications of 15 assembly members he claimed did not
participate in the mainland elections.
   At one point, opposition members tried to shove 80-year-old
Assemblywoman Liu Hsiang-ku from the meeting room, but stopped when
she showed a certificate proving she was elected on the mainland.
   Opposition members, who hold only 11 seats, staged a violent
protest on Feb. 19 when the electoral college began its one-month
session.
   Days later, a riot in which scores were injured broke out around
the Legislature.

   Nevada's oldest town finally has a gas
station, but not for long. And more than 80 outsiders have taken up
residence, including actor James Caan, but they're just temporary
too.
   Genoa, renamed Silver Creek, Colo., for the time being, will be
the setting for director Rob Reiner's latest movie, ``Misery,''
based on horror writer Stephen King's novel about a writer
imprisoned by an insane woman.
   Since Hollywood's arrival last week, this town of about 400
residents nestling at the foot of the Sierra Nevada 10 miles south
of Carson City has been transformed.
   A new sign at Genoa's main intersection reads ``Welcome to
Silver Creek. Established 1851,'' a year after the real town was
founded.
   However, anyone who pulls up to the new ``gas station'' will
find that the pumps don't work.
   The new pay telephone outside Stan and Bobby's Sporting Goods,
Liquor, and Video Rental store doesn't work, either. Shirley
Giovacchini, whose home serves as the store, said only one
disgruntled visitor has tried to use it so far.
   But the four new buildings on Main Street built by the film crew
aren't fake. Genoa now has a cafe, general store, radiator shop and
sheriff's station.
   Reiner is shooting the film on a closed set off limits to the
public and media, and has hired about 100 locals as extras.
   Genoa was picked for the movie because the town is a day's drive
from Los Angeles and resembles the fictional Colorado town in
King's book, Enochs said.

   Runoffs will be necessary in at least three of the
four Soviet republics that held their first free legislative
elections this weekend, unofficial returns indicated Monday.
   Tass said runoffs would be held in the Baltic republic of
Lithuania, where the Communist Party was voted out of power, and in
the Central Asian republics of Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia.
   It said preliminary results were not available for Moldavia,
where the Popular Front has said it hoped to win at least half the
380 seats in the republic's legislature.
   Sajudis, the Lithuanian popular front, apeared to have won
Saturday's elections by a landslide, according to Tass, the
official Soviet news agency.
   Unofficial returns Sunday indicated Sajudis candidates won 72 of
the 90 seats decided and the remaining 51 legislators are to be
chosen in runoffs March 10. Tass said official results were
expected Tuesday.
   The goal of Sajudis is to make Lithuania independent, as it was
for 22 years before 1940, and negotiate an orderly secession with
Moscow. The Soviet Union annexed Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in
1940, under a secret agreement with Nazi Germany.
   In the Central Asian republics of Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia,
candidates fell short of majorities in more than half the districts.
   Tass said Kirghizia, a mountainous republic on the border with
China, would conduct runoffs early in March, but did not give
details. It indicated a similar schedule for Tadzhikistan, where at
least 22 people were killed in recent ethnic unrest.
   Reports from Dushanbe, capital of Tadzhikistan, said the
election turnout was 64 percent. Tass said official results in both
Central Asian elections were expected Thursday.
   It said no early returns were available from Moldavia, which
borders Romania and has ethnic and cultural roots to that country.
The Moldavian Popular Front has said it would press for the right
of direct trade with other countries, a multiparty system, private
property and a market economy.

   Gale-force winds struck Europe on Monday, tearing
down roofs and power lines, disrupting transportation on land, sea
and air, and killing at least 35 people.
   Winds were clocked at 100 mph at Aberporth along the Scottish
border, while Leeds in central England reported winds of up to 98
mph.
   It was the second major storm to hit Europe since Jan. 25, when
95 people were killed in winds that gusted up to 106 mph. Wind
speeds in late January and February were the strongest in 18 years,
averaging 15 mph the last two weeks at Heathrow Airport, the London
Weather Center said.
   Flood warnings were posted on the north coast of West Germany
and parts of Denmark. Fishing boats were kept in port on France's
west coast.
   Twelve deaths were reported in Britain, seven in West Germany
and two in East Germany, five in Belgium, seven in France, and one
each in Ireland and the Netherlands.
   The dead included a driver whose double-decker bus hit a fallen
tree, an elderly man killed by a falling chimney and an elderly
woman struck by a chunk of slate blown from a roof, police and
rescue workers said.
   A policeman on patrol in suburban Brussels was killed and a
colleague was injured when a tree was blown onto their car. In
northeastern Damme, Belgium, the roof of the tourism office
collapsed, killing one worker and injuring another. Two people died
when their home collapsed in Bekkevoort, Belgium. A motorist was
also killed by a tree in Embourg near Liege.
   In Hamburg, West Germany, a 76-year-old woman was killed when
winds pushed her in front of a moving car.
   The dead in France included a 3-year-old girl killed by a
falling branch in Avesnes sur Helpes. In the suburbs of Paris,
where winds peaked at 75 mph, a 22-year-old man was killed by a
falling wall and a 17-year-old was fatally injured by a slamming
door.
   In Ireland, a motorcyclist was killed when a gust blew him off
the road; a woman died in Zundert, in the southern Netherlands,
when she lost control of her car during the storm.
   In the North Wales seaside town of Towyn, police were evacuating
2,000 people threatened by a high tide. Huge waves smashed a
200-yard hole in the sea wall and sent a torrent cascading through
the streets, flooding homes.
   Four Royal Air Force helicopters began evacuating people soon
after midday, but with a midnight high tide threatening to engulf
the town, lifeboats, fishing vessels and other craft were called in.
   A spokesman for Bodelwyddan Hospital, where many of the Towyn
people were taken, said 30 people had been brought in suffering
hypothermia and shock, and ``a further 70 or so have been brought
here by the helicopters simply because they have lost their homes.''
   Police imposed a 50 mph speed limit in some areas in Britain,
and the Automobile Association advised motorists to stay home. Many
other traffic accidents were reported in northern Belgium and in
the western Netherlands.
   In the Netherlands, 15 people were injured, including seven hurt
when a huge tent in which they were celebrating Carnival collapsed
in the southern town of Beek, Dutch radio reported.
   The winds disrupted ferry service between Ireland and Wales, as
well as between the British mainland and the Isle of Wight and
Northern Ireland. One Belfast-Liverpool ferry was forced to return
to port because of high seas.
   In Hull, on Britain's west coast, damaged inner lock gates at
King George Dock prevented two ferries from Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, and Zeebrugge, Belgium, with about 1,000 passengers on
board, from docking. The ferries were waiting offshore until high
tide Monday night.
   In the port of Antwerp, a river ship sank after a 15-ton crane
fell onto the vessel, injuring several people.
   Cuts in the overhead power lines halted some train traffic in
Belgium, the state-owned railroad company said.
   Two bridges linking the southern and northern parts of the
Netherlands were closed because of high winds, police said.
   Thousands of homes in Northern Ireland, the Thames Valley, south
Wales and southwestern England were without electricity.
   Thirty residents of a senior citizens home in Stockport, near
Manchester, were evacuated after the roof was blown off during the
night, according to Press Association, the domestic British news
agency.
   Rail service on the main line from Euston Station in London to
the northwest was disrupted by downed power lines. British Rail
reported scattered cancellations, and some trains were restricted
to speeds as low as 20 mph because of the winds.
   At Heathrow Airport, many airlines were unable to load catered
meals onto airplanes, and passengers were instead offered meals in
the departure lounges. Authorities feared winds could blow over the
trucks that lift trays of prepared meals onto aircraft.
   Flights were operating normally, but were canceled at Birmingham
Airport, 100 miles to the northwest.
   At Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, the Netherlands' flag carrier
KLM suspended 15 international flights, the airline said.

<HEAD>ABC Home Video Special Beats Rooney-Less 60 Minutes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS's usually top-rated ``60 Minutes'' came in
second Sunday to a rerun of the one-hour premiere of ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos, preliminary ratings from A.C.
Nielsen Co. showed Monday.
   CBS, however, dismissed speculation that the ratings loss was a
result of the network's suspension of humorist Andy Rooney.
   ``It's stretching things to blame it on the absence of Rooney,''
said Michael Eisenberg, CBS vice president for research.
   Acccording to overnight ratings from 23 cities, ABC's rerun got
a 31 per cent share of the audience and ``60 Minutes'' a 27 per
cent share. NBC was a distant third with an 11 per cent share with
a shortened version of the 1951 Disney cartoon classic, ``Alice in
Wonderland.''
   National audience estimates are due on Tuesday.
   Eisenberg said ABC's show, first was shown on Nov. 26, was a
strong one and the half-hour series that followed it has proved a
ratings hit. Sunday's ABC show aired in the time period usually
held by ``Life Goes On.'
   Rooney, a ``60 Minutes'' feature since 1978, was suspended
without pay for three months on Feb. 8 after a national gay
magazine attributed a racial slur to him. Rooney denied making the
remark.
   CBS News president David Burke never has given a specific reason
publicly for Rooney's suspension.

   An Israeli Air Force serviceman was slightly
injured Monday when his Cessna plane was forced to make an
emergency landing in the occupied Gaza Strip, the military command
said.
   The plane, with two Air Force servicemen aboard, took off from
an airfield in Israel for a routine training flight but developed a
technical problem and had to make the emergency landing on a Gaza
airstrip, the army said.
   It said the wounded serviceman was taken to a hospital in the
southern town of Ashkelon. His companion suffered no injuries.
   No further details about the accident were released.

   It took three guys using a diamond-edged
power saw and a jackhammer to knock Rocky Balboa off his feet
Monday.
   The crew worked for more than two hours to separate the 8{-foot
bronze likeness of the city's fictitious boxer from the steps of
the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which has repeatedly insisted it
doesn't want the statue.
   A lawyer for ``Rocky'' creator Sylvester Stallone pledged to
fight on to get the statue, a movie prop, a permanent home atop the
museum steps.
   In the original ``Rocky,'' which won best picture and best
director Academy Awards in 1976, Stallone's Balboa character ran up
the museum's stone steps in triumph while training for a fight.
   The statue had been moved to the museum from the Spectrum sports
arena for the filming of Stallone's latest ``Rocky'' movie, ``Rocky
V.'' Since filming of ``Rocky V'' ended here Friday, that cleared
the way for the movie producers to move Stallone's likeness, at the
museum's insistence.
   Using the power saw, the crew from W. Cantano &amp; Sons cut into
the statue's concrete base about 12 inches below Rocky's 22-inch
feet to get at four prongs anchoring the statue into the concrete.
   After separating the 800-pound statue from the base, workers
used a crane to lift it onto a truck. The stub of the concrete base
was to be removed within hours.
   ``I feel kind of bad,'' said Bret Carpin of Cantano, which has
moved the statue four times in the continuing battle between art
and fiction. ``I hope he doesn't hold it against us.''
   The museum was closed Monday, as usual, but the statue moving
drew a crowd of television crews, photographers, curious museum
employees and a few tourists.
   Amy Crackel from Decatur, Ill., came with her aunt, Susan, of
Wayne, to see Rocky. ``It was neat to come the day they're moving
it,'' she said, adding she has seen all four Rocky movies and plans
to see the fifth.
   The statue will be placed in storage at the Spectrum until a new
base can be built there, said Spectrum spokeswoman Debbie Albert.
   Stallone's lawyer, former state boxing commissioner James Binns,
said the statue's removal ``really has nothing to do with where the
statue will end up permanently. We will argue to have it moved back
to the art museum.''
   Fans protested the move. Even Mayor W. Wilson Goode supported
leaving the statue at the museum.
   But museum officials have noted the statue's disproportionately
large feet and overall small size relative to the museum in saying
it was not an appropriate home.
   The statue was first placed in front of the museum for the
filming of ``Rocky III'' and left there after the movie opened in
1982. Museum officials then said Stallone failed to remove it from
their front steps as agreed, and the museum had to pay $12,000 to
get it moved to the sports arena.
   When museum officials were approached about returning the statue
for the fourth sequel, they demanded an agreement that the
production company remove the statue when filming was over.

<TEXT>
   When President Daniel Ortega admitted
his defeat at the polls early Monday, most of those applauding him,
singing the Sandinista Front anthem and crying their eyes out were
Sandalistas.
   Sandalistas are the battalions of idealistic foreigners, mainly
Americans and Western Europeans, who came to Nicaragua after the
Sandinista revolution of July 1979.
   Nicaraguans gave them their nickname because of their fondness
for thick leather sandals, part of a sort of uniform by which
Sandalistas can be recognized at a distance.
   It was these foreigners who shouted catcalls and obscenities a
few hours later in the same convention hall, when former U.S.
President Jimmy Carter, U.N. observer mission chief Elliot
Richardson and others held a news conference on the elections.
   ``The U.S. put the pressure on and the people had no choice''
but to vote for opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, said Monika von Flotow.
   Ms. von Flotow, 33, a physical therapist from Santa Rosa,
Calif., has been working for the past year in Matiguas, a small
town deep in central Matagalpa province.
   It is in the midst of Contra territory, where people often are
maimed by land mines or in skirmishes between rebels and soldiers.
   ``I don't think people were proud of how they voted,'' said Ms.
von Flotow, her eyes red from weeping after Ortega's moving speech.
   Margo Malone, 29, of Bellingham, Wash., climbed atop a desk to
see Ortega as he spoke.
   She hugged a friend and sobbed as the last strains of the
Sandinista National Liberation Front anthem, the one with a line
calling ``the Yankee, the enemy of humanity,'' filled the hall.
   ``The United States has shown that it can destroy a really
important process, a really important revolution,'' said Ms.
Malone, who has been in Nicaragua four months on her first visit.
   Not all Sandalistas dress alike. Ms. von Flotow, for example,
has a conservative, unadorned look.
   But by and large, Sandalista woman can be recognized by flowing
Indian print skirts and cotton tank tops; the men by often frayed
pants and ancient T-shirts.
   For both sexes, however, it is cotton everything; a knapsack on
every back; a look of blissful wonder at the natives and, for many,
a feeling that the United States is ``the enemy of humanity.''
   They often have little money for themselves, but have organized
a worldwide ``solidarity'' network that has raised millions of
dollars for the Sandinista government and organized pressure
campaigns to bear upon the U.S. Congress and other governments.
   Nicaraguans have a low opinion of Sandalistas because of their
unquestioning idealization of the Sandinistas and because many of
them apparently have no little time to bath in Nicaragua's tropical
heat.
   At a news conference by Carter, Richardson and other invited
election observers, ``internationalistas,'' as the Sandinistas are
also called, created a spectacle.
   They hammered on desks and booed at Carter when he said, ``I
don't try to justify the actions of our government,'' answering a
question as to why Washington continues supporting the Contras.
   Richardson, a former U.S. attorney general, was interrupted with
obscene catcalls when he said he thought the United States would
have normalized relations with the Sandinistas had Ortega won the
elections.

<TEXT>
   Mozambican rebels claimed Monday that
government forces backed by Zimbabwean troops and planes have
launched a major offensive against guerrilla positions in central
Mozambique.
   A statement distributed in the Portuguese capital by the
Mozambican National Resistance said 2,500 Mozambican and Zimbabwean
troops attacked rebel strongholds in the Gorongoza highlands Monday
in Sofala province.
   The statement said the offensive was spearheaded by troops
carried by Zimbabwean transport planes and backed by Soviet-built
combat planes and helicopters.
   The Mozambican news agency AIM reported Saturday that government
forces had destroyed four rebel camps the past week, one in Sofala
and three in the south.
   The AIM report said 57 rebels were killed in the actions, but
gave no indication these were major operations. AIM made no mention
of Zimbabwean troops.
   Rebel leader Afonso Dhlakama is thought to have his headquarters
in Gorongoza, 560 miles north of the capital Maputo.
   The rebels, who are also known by the Portuguese acronym Renamo,
said a column of infantry and artillery was supporting the airborne
troops. There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claims.
   The Renamo statement said the attack showed the ``bad faith'' of
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who together with his Kenyan
counterpart Daniel arap Moi has been attempting to mediate
tentative peace moves to end 13 years of fighting in Mozambique.
   Despite intermittent talks between Renamo officials and
Mozambican church leaders in Nairobi, Kenya, since last July,
reports of violent clashes have continued.
   Earlier this month, the government accused Renamo of killing
over 50 civilians in an attack on a train bringing Mozambican
miners from work in neighboring South Africa.
   The rebels have faced repeated accusations of civilian massacres
since they launched their insurgency in 1977, two years after
Mozambique gained independence from Portugal.
   South Africa formerly supported the rebels, but since a 1984
accord between Maputo and Pretoria no government openly backs the
rebels.

<HEAD>Senate Committee May Act Quickly on Alaska Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate committee that
oversees the Tongass National Forest in Alaska said Monday he plans
fast action on legislation affecting timber deals and wilderness
protection there.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said ``Individuals might propose
dramatically different solutions to the Tongass issue,'' but ``they
almost all agree that what is needed most in southeast Alaska is
certainty.''
   The size of West Virginia and Delaware combined, the forest is
treasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear and
bald eagles, and the largest spawning ground for salmon. It is the
last remaining temperate-zone rain forest in North America.
   To local residents, it is the keystone of their economy through
the timber it yields.
   The jobs-environment conflict has made the forest one of the
most vigorously fought environmental issues in Congress since 1980,
when Alaska lands legislation established the current forest
management regime.
   During a hearing on legislation the House passed last summer,
Johnston said he would have a Senate bill ready for a committee
vote next week and fast floor action ``in hopes of getting to
conference with the House and resolving these issues once and for
all.''
   The House measure would cancel 50-year contracts with two timber
companies who supportrs of the bill say stifled other competition
while getting trees at bargain rates.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who led the House debate for the
bill called the contracts ``a raid on the taxpayers.'' Critics have
claimed that the government in recent years has wound up getting $2
in revenue for $100 in timber production costs.
   Miller and other supporters said the legislation would open the
forest to other companies and make more money for the government.
It also strengthens restrictions on timbering in order to protect
the wildlife habitat.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he and the rest of the
Alaska delegation, Sen. Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young, all oppose
the House bill, which he says would cripple the economy of
southeastern Alaska.
   Murkowski said the government is not losing money on Tongass
timber sales and expanded wilderness areas in the forest are not
needed.
   ``The purpose of our fight now is to maintain the viablity of
Alaska communities whose lifeblood is the resources produced on
public lands,'' said Murkowski, who has introduced a bill that
preserves the 50-year contracts with Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan
and Alaska Pulp Co., a Japanese firm.
   Murkowski said the committee should postpone action on Tongass
until June when the Forest Service will release a revised plan for
the forest.
   Patricia Kearney, acting assistant secretary of agriculture for
forests, said the service spent $7 million and two years working on
the plan and urged that it be considered before Congress takes
final action on how to manage the forest.

   The Defense Department's plan to buy 34
additional helicopters for commando missions at an estimated cost
of $532 million lacks a ``sound mission-based justification,'' a
congressional report said Monday.
   The Defense Department disagreed, saying plans to cancel a new
vertical takeoff airplane make the additional helicopters necessary.
   The General Accounting Office said the Army based its decision
to buy 34 MH-47E helicopters from The Boeing Co.'s
Philadelphia-based Helicopters Division, in addition to its own
needs of 17, on a May 1984 agreement between the Army and the Air
Force.
   The accord said the Air Force would transfer the responsibility
for providing helicopter support for commando operations to the
Army.
   But in June 1987, the Defense Department told Congress that it
had revised its requirements and only needed 17 MH-47E helicopters,
and 41 MH-53J helicopters, to fly these missions of about 265 to
520 miles.
   ``The Army's reason for procuring an additional 34 MH-47E
aircraft is based on an earlier memorandum of agreement between the
Air Force and the Army, which has been superseded by the 1987
report,'' the GAO said.
   ``Therefore, we believe that the procurement of an additional 34
MH-47E aircraft at a total cost of $532 million is not warranted''
and ``without sound mission-based justification.''
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., who requested the GAO report, said
the helicopters are needed to transport troops in and out of
hostile territory, but the GAO was ``quite blunt in its
conclusion.''
   The Defense Department, in comments on a draft of the GAO
report, disagreed with the agency's conclusion, saying it needed
the additional helicopters because of the Bush administration's
proposal to cancel the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor vertical takeoff
airplane, a joint project of Boeing and Bell Helicopter Textron.

   A bagpiper played ``Scotland the
Brave'' at a private funeral Monday for Malcolm Forbes, the
multi-millionaire publisher known for selling the joy of capitalism.
   The service for Forbes, who has been mourned by business leaders
and socialites worldwide, was attended only by immediate family at
The Church of St. John on the Mountain in this rustic borough 50
miles west of New York, where Forbes Inc. is headquartered.
   Forbes, the son of a poor Scottish family who emigrated to the
United States and worked his way to affluence on Wall Street, died
of a heart attack in his sleep Saturday at his 40-acre estate in
nearby Far Hills. He was 70.
   His son Malcolm Jr. or ``Steve,'' who will succeed him as head
of the publishing empire, delivered the eulogy, the Rev. Alfred
Niese, pastor of the episcopal church, told The Courier-News of
Bridgewater.
   Niese, who presided over services, would not give details about
the ceremony.
   Niese said family members have attended the church since the
late 1950s. Present at the funeral were Forbes' former wife
Roberta; daughter Moira Mumma; four sons, Steve, Robert,
Christopher and Timothy; and eight grandchildren.
   Forbes, whose worth has been placed anywhere from $400 million
to $1 billion, was known as much for his recreational derring-do as
a motorcyclist and balloonist as he was for his business acumen.
   He also was a lavish party-thrower and made his last birthday
his biggest.
   Following a 1\-hour ceremony Monday, Forbes' flag-draped pine
coffin was carried by his sons and grandsons to a hearse.
   His body is to be cremated and interred on the Fiji island of
Lucala, owned by the Forbes family.
   A public memorial service was scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at
St. Bartholomew's Church in Manhattan.

   Armored cars and troops were deployed
in the center of the capital Monday as student demonstrators armed
with sticks and broken bottles forced newly reopened schools to
close.
   There were no immediate reports of serious incidents or injuries.
   Air traffic controllers went on strike during the day, halting
domestic and international flights. Postal and telecommunications
workers and electricity workers also stopped work, cutting
telephone links in the capital and power supply to some quarters of
Gabon.
   President Omar Bongo, assailed by a failed coup attempt in
October and violent student protests last month, was meeting with a
crisis committee formed last week to try to dissolve social tension
that has mounted under a 17-month-old austerity program.
   The strikes and protests indicate dissatisfaction with major
political reforms announced by Bongo on Friday, including the
creation of a Social Democratic Assembly to replace his discredited
Democratic Party.
   Bongo told the nation in a televised address Friday that the new
assembly would be open to all political ideas. But it falls short
of his earlier promises to consider transforming Gabon into a
multiparty democracy.
   After a weekend respite from strikes and protests, students took
to the streets Monday with broken bottles and sticks.
   They forced newly reopened schools in the capital to close. A
panic ensued at one school and students scuffled, but no injuries
were reported.
   Some students set up barricades on roads. They were forced to
disperse by soldiers and police, according to witnesses who
provided no details.
   The elite Presidential Guard set up temporary camps in the March
12 suburb on the outskirts of the city where the National Assembly
is located as well as the homes of many diplomats and high-ranking
government officials.
   Last week, teachers, doctors and nurses stopped strikes to
protest poor salaries and working conditions after Bongo promised a
general review of government salaries at the end of the year.
   Under an austerity program imposed as a condition of further
credit from Western nations and institutions, Gabonese government
employees were forced to take pay cuts averaging 3 percent in
October 1988. Other government spending also was reduced sharply,
including the budget for education and health.

   President Bush hailed Violeta Chamorro's upset
election in Nicaragua as a ``clear mandate for peace and
democracy'' Monday, and his spokesman said Bush wanted to lift U.S.
trade sanctions that have hobbled the country's economy.
   Bush said the vote to oust leftist President Daniel Ortega
``moves us one step closer to the day when every nation in this
hemisphere is a democracy.'' He called for a peaceful transfer of
power from the Sandinista government that has ruled for 10 years.
   In a message aimed both at the Sandinistas and the
U.S.-supported army of Contra rebels who tried to overthrow the
government, Bush said, ``Given the clear mandate for peace and
democracy, there is no reason at all for further military activity
from any quarter.''
   Later Monday, the president phoned Mrs. Chamorro to congraulate
her on her victory. ``The president said the election reinforces
the Nicaraguan people's commitment to the peace process and towards
building a free and open society,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush told Mrs. Chamorro the election was ``a great day for the
Nicaraguan people,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Bush also discussed the situation with a
number of allied leaders.
   There were immediate calls in Congress for aid for Mrs.
Chamorro's government, which is to be inaugurated April 25.
   ``We must provide her new government with aid, and let's not kid
ourselves _ it will take big bucks,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``Nobody said democracy was cheap,'' said House
Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Dante Fascell, D-Fla.
   However, others cautioned that with a growing line of potential
new foreign aid recipients _ Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia,
Panama and others _ it would be difficult to promise any quick,
major grants.
   Mrs. Chamorro's election was a sweet victory for the U.S.
government, which had spent hundreds of millions of dollars in
military and other assistance to arm the Contras and keep them
going, and had also clamped economic sanctions on Nicaragua.
   In Riverside, Calif., Vice President Dan Quayle praised the
Contras, saying, ``The Contras were an important force throughout
to bring democracy.''
   Ortega was a major irritant to the White House, and a frequent
target of derision from presidents Reagan and Bush. As recently as
October, Bush ridiculed Ortega at a summit of Latin leaders in
Costa Rica as ``this little man'' and as ``that unwanted animal at
a garden party.''
   Changing his tune, Bush publicly congratulated Ortega Monday for
allowing a free and fair election and pledging to abide by its
results. Moreover, Bush said there is ``space in a democratic
Nicaragua for all political points of view.''
   Reagan, whose administration played a major role in arming the
Contras, said that ``the people of Nicaragua and the cause of
democracy have won an impressive and important victory'' and that
``now is the time for all parties to put down their weapons and
join in a common pursuit of what is in the best interests of the
Nicaraguan people.''
   American supporters of the Sandinista government expressed
disappointment at the election outcome but also said that the
election was fair.
   The Rev. William Sloane Coffin said, ``The vote was largely one
to end the killing, a vote for peace that the United States had
shattered for years by arming the Contras. ... It was also a vote
for food which our unilateral embargo had helped deny Nicaraguan
families.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III pointedly said the
international community ``will insist that the decision of the
Nicaraguan people be respected and that full civil and military
power be transferred to the newly elected government.''
   Bush said, ``We hope that all sides in this hotly fought contest
will extend the hand of reconciliation and cooperate together in
rebuilding their country for the good of all Nicaraguans.''
   He said he had talked with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres
Perez about ``appropriate trade and economic measures that we can
take to support the new government of Nicaragua.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted the lift
U.S. sanctions ``as soon as it is feasible.'' He said he expected
there would be a decision fairly soon.
   The sanctions will expire May 1 unless Bush extends them. Some
officials are recommending Bush lift them much sooner if the
Sandinistas show a disposition to respect the election results.
These officials contend that early action on the sanctions would
enable Nicaragua to get a head start on economic recovery.
   ``We certainly feel a special responsibility for the people of
Nicaragua and the courageous actions that they have taken to bring
these elections about,'' Fitzwater said.
   He also suggested the White House will seek more humanitarian
aid for the Contras, many of whom are camped just outside Nicaragua
in Honduras, after their U.S. funds run out this week.
   The trade embargo against Nicaragua was imposed on May 1, 1985,
by then-President Reagan. It barred imports from Nicaragua and
banned U.S. exports to that country except to support the Contra
rebels. It also prohibited Nicaraguan aircraft or boats from
entering the United States.
   Mrs. Chamorro, 60, the publisher of the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, had been criticized by Ortega as an instrument of U.S.
policy. She headed the United Nationalist Opposition, a fractious
alliance of 14 parties ranging from far right to far left.
   ``Any friend of democracy can take heart in the fact that
Violeta Chamorro won the election, and the election process ... is
a credit to the people of Nicaragua, who chose to determine their
nation's future at the ballot box,'' Bush said. ``And that is a
victory for democracy.''
   Bush said, ``For years the people of Nicaragua have suffered.
And today the people of Nicaragua have spoken.''
   The president learned of Mrs. Chamorro's victory in a 4:30 a.m.
telephone call from Baker.
   Baker, in turn, had been called 15 minutes earlier by former
President Jimmy Carter in Managua, where he was leading a team of
election observers.
   Fitzwater said Bush called British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas ``to thank them for the support they had
exhibited over the past months for the return to a democratic
process in Nicaragua.''
   And Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called Bush to
discuss the election and to voice support for ``the transfer to
democratic rule,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said that Bush, in meetings through the day with top
aides on the election outcome, ``was very calm and concerned that
we give full credit to the people of Nicaragua.''

   A small earthquake shook the
eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada on Monday morning. No damage was
immediately reported.
   Seismologists at California Institute of Technology in Pasadena
registered the 7:17 a.m. temblor at 3.5 on the Richter scale, while
the United States Geological Service at Menlo Park had a 3.9
reading.
   The epicenter was 17 miles southeast of Mammoth Lakes and 20
miles west-northwest of Bishop.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. appeals court on Monday upheld the
conviction of a demonstrator who burned an American flag, but the
justices did not rule on the constitutionality of a new federal law
outlawing flag burning.
   A federal judge in Seattle has ruled the law unconstitutional
and the Justice Department said Friday it would appeal directly to
the Supreme Court.
   The demonstrator in Monday's case, William Charles Cary Jr., was
sentenced to three months in prison and fined $25 for his role in
the flag burning during a March 18, 1988, protest against U.S.
involvement in Honduras.
   The demonstration in Minneapolis was outside an armed services
recruitment center and the blazing flag was thrown into the
occupied center, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals noted.
   Cary appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the federal
statute that prohibits flag burning, which was passed after the
U.S. Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas flag desecration
statute as unconstitutional because it suppressed free expression.
   In Monday's 2-1 decision, a panel of the 8th Circuit said Cary's
conviction was justified by the federal government's interest in
halting and preventing further breaches of peace in front of its
Armed Services Recruitment Center.
   The court noted that it was not affirming the conviction on the
same grounds that the lower court based its ruling on. It said the
lower court appeared to have upheld the constitutionality of the
flag statute based upon a government interest in protecting the
flag as a national symbol.
   According to the 8th Circuit opinion, written by Judge Frank
Magill, the demonstration in Minneapolis attracted several hundred
people opposed to the government's decision to send 3,200 troops to
Honduras.
   The court said the demonstration turned violent in front of the
recruitment center, as protesters broke windows and shot Roman
candles through them.
   After Cary lit the flag, he threw it into an alcove of the
recruitment center, the court said. Several other people rushed to
put it out because of fears that the flames might ignite the
occupied building, the court's opinion said.
   ``Cary's conduct demonstrated an intent to convey his
disagreement with American foreign policy in Central America,'' the
court wrote. Therefore, the court said, Cary's conduct was in the
realm of free expression protected by the First Amendment.
   ``However, unlike (the Texas case), the government's interest in
preventing breaches of the peace is implicated by the facts in this
case. ... Because of the ongoing violence, there was an immediate
threat that the burning would encourage the violence to continue,''
the court wrote.
   In his dissenting opinion, Circuit Judge Theodore McMillian said
he believed the case was controlled by the Supreme Court's decision
in the Texas case.
   ``The First Amendment prohibits the government from criminally
punishing appellant for burning the flag of the United States as a
means of politcal protest. Accordingly, I would reverse the
judgment of the District Court,'' he wrote.

   Burt Rutan, who designed the revolutionary
Voyager airplane that circled the globe without refueling, showed
off his new high-tech, low-cost combat jet on Monday, and the Air
Force was impressed.
   More than 400 people turned out at Mojave Airport to watch the
Ares aircraft go through its paces after emerging from Rutan's
Scaled Composites Inc. hangar in the high desert.
   The lightweight, easy-to-maintain plane proved its agility in a
10-minute demonstration flight that marked only the fifth time the
sleek gray, white and blue aircraft has been flown.
   ``It handled real comfortably,'' pilot Doug Shane said
afterwards. ``It's very maneuverable, extremely agile.''
   ``I'm interested in it from an innovative technology point of
view,'' said Air Force Maj. Gen. John Schoeppner Jr. ``It's quite
fascinating. I'm very excited about his design.''
   The twin-tailed aircraft is powered by a single turbofan engine,
and is made of composites, non-metallic materials such as graphite,
which are strong but are not as heavy as traditional aviation
metals.
   The plane's most distinctive feature is a Rutan specialty: a
canard, or small wing, emerging from the fuselage forward of the
main wing.
   Possible uses for the plane, which was three years in the
making, include stopping drug smugglers, close air support
operations and anti-helicopter missions. The aircraft is designed
to be fitted with a 25mm gun or air-to-air and air-to-ground
missiles.
   In a news release, Scaled Composites said the jet can provide
``minimum complexity, maintenance and acquisition costs to armies
and air forces worldwide.''
   Rutan refused to give a price for the plane. ``I can't talk
about potential customers,'' he said.
   The plane's name comes from the Greek god of war, but is used as
an acronym for capabilities and qualities the builder believes will
sell it: Agile, Responsive, Effective Support.
   Rutan gained fame for designing Voyager, the ungainly, slender
airplane that his brother, Dick, and co-pilot Jeana Yeager flew
around the world non-stop on a single tank of fuel.
   Rutan used lightweight composite carbon-fiber materials, a
canard design and fuel-stingy engines to allow Voyager to stay
aloft the nine days it took to complete the 25,000-mile flight in
December 1986.

   A key co-defendant of Manuel Noriega is negotiating
a plea bargain that could put him on the stand against his former
boss, a defense attorney said Monday.
   ``The discussions are making good progress,'' said Samuel
Burstyn, attorney for former Panamanian army Lt. Col. Luis del Cid.
   ``At some point, the lieutenant colonel may be confronted with
an option he can't refuse.''
   Burstyn refused to reveal details, except to say the proposed
sentence would be far less than the 40 years del Cid was offered
when taken into custody on drug-trafficking charges. And he added
that the deal had not yet been signed.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan refused to comment on
the possibility of a plea bargain.
   Noriega attorney Steven Kollin said the plea bargaining caught
his defense team by surprise, and refused immediate comment.
   ``When he gets the plea, then we'll worry about it,'' said
another Noriega attorney, David Lewis.
   A source involved in the case who spoke on condition of
anonymity said one proposal would have del Cid serving as little as
two to four years in prison in return for cooperation against the
ousted Panamanian dictator.
   If convicted of all charges in the February 1988 indictment, del
Cid could be sentenced to 70 years in prison.
   After his surrender in the wake of the December invasion of
Panama, del Cid was identified by the U.S. government as one of
Noriega's right-hand men.
   Burstyn would not confirm that del Cid would take the stand
against his former boss, but noted that once he pleaded guilty he
could not refuse a prosecution subpoena.
   The indictment against Noriega accuses del Cid of accepting
$200,000 in drug payoff money from the government's star witness,
pilot Floyd Carlton Caceres. The payoff came shortly after Carlton
and Noriega fixed the price of a cocaine shipment they were making
on behalf of the Medellin cocaine cartel, authorities said.
   Del Cid also appeared in a photograph at the side of Fidel
Castro and Noriega in Cuba _ a meeting prosecutors claim was to
smooth relations between the Panamanian leader and the Colombian
cartel after one of its laboratories was raided in Panama.
   Confirmation of del Cid's plea negotiations came outside a
hearing on the Noriega case before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler. The attorneys were trying to devise a way to handle
classified documents expected to be at the heart of Noriega's
defense.
   Lewis, a New York-based expert on the Classified Information
Protection Act, said the government's tough rules would classify
material even when already printed in a book, as in the case of the
just-published ``Our Man in Panama'' by John Dinges.
   Michael Olmsted, a Washington-based Justice Department attorney,
said it makes no difference if information is widely known or not.
   ``Just because there was publication of a fact we consider
classified does not ... make it unclassified,'' Olmsted said.
   Fellow prosecutor James McAdams of the U.S. attorney's office in
Miami said prosecutors also are battling secretiveness.
   ``We have intelligence agencies saying `we know you have to try
your case, but you're not going to do it with our stuff,'''
complained McAdams.
   On the other hand, he said, defense attorneys are trying to push
the prosecution in an attempt to force the government to drop
charges to avoid revealing secrets.
   Hoeveler, noting the classified-information complications, said
he hoped the trial would begin in November, but said it would start
no later than January 1991.
   The judge also heard arguments by attorneys for the four
remaining Noriega co-defendants in custody or out on bond,
requesting separate trials.
   But prosecutors insisted the five be tried together.
   Hoeveler said he would rule later on the outstanding secrecy
issues and the requests for separate trials.
   A sixth defendant, Panamanian pilot Eduardo Pardo, has pleaded
guilty to flying drug proceeds from Fort Lauderdale to Panama. He
has not been sentenced. Ten more defendants, including Medellin
cartel boss Pablo Escobar Gaviria, remain at large.

   United Press International said Monday it had
asked a federal court for an injunction to prevent Reuters from
backing out of a photo exchange agreement between the two news
services.
   Reuters and UPI agreed in 1984 that UPI would provide news
pictures from the United States to Reuters, while Reuters would
provide UPI with pictures from other countries. The agreement was
to run for 10 years.
   On Feb. 16, Reuters said it was canceling the agreement, and
interrupted the exchange for four hours. Reuters said it was suing
UPI in U.S. District Court in New York for an unspecified sum
representing money it lost on the agreement.
   UPI's suit, also filed in U.S. District Court in New York,
denied Reuters' allegations that UPI's service had declined since
the exchange started in 1985.

   The election of Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro as president of Nicaragua spells hope for peace and
democracy in Central America, Salvadoran leaders said Monday.
   Mrs. Chamorro, candidate for the United National Opposition
party alliance, was the surprise winner of Sunday's race over
incumbent Daniel Ortega, head of the leftist Sandinista party that
has governed Nicaragua since 1979.
   Armando Calderon Sol, head of the ruling Nationalist Republican
Alliance Party, known as Arena, used the occasion to call for
reopening of peace negotiations between the Salvadoran government
and rebels, locked in a 10-year-old civil war that has claimed
72,000 lives.
   ``With the upset of the Sandinistas, democracy in the region is
taking hold. There's no call to go on killing in El Salvador, and
we should facilitate dialogue,'' Calderon said.
   ``This is a historic moment of reflection for the Salvadorans. I
believe that now is when the Salvadoran democratic process should
open political spaces for the incorporation of the guerillas and
seek social harmony,'' he said.
   The Salvadoran government congratulated Mrs. Chamorro in a
statement issued by Foreign Vice Minister Ricardo Valdivieso.
   Chamorro's triumph ``opens broad hopes for Nicaragua's social
and economic development process and that of the whole Central
American region,'' Valdivieso said.
   Salvadoran opposition party spokesman Ruben Zamora also praised
Ortega's government for a clean electoral process.
   The elections ``are an example of democracy,'' said Zamora, head
of the Popular Social Christian Movement party and the Democratic
Revolutionary Front.
   Zamora's party and the Democratic Revolutionary Front are
politically aligned with the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front guerrillas, known as FMLN.
   Calderon, referring to rumors that Nicaragua has sent weapons to
the Salvadoran rebels, said the fall of Sandinista government means
``the FMLN is historically cut off.''
   Col. Mauricio Ernesto Vargas, military commander in four eastern
provinces of El Salvador, said, ``This means the FMLN will have to
change. They're going to lose the suupport they had from Nicaragua
for damaging the political economic and social system in El
Salvador,'' he said.
   ``Peace is closer with the change in Nicaragua,'' said Vargas in
a telephone interview with The Associated Press.
   Salvadoran rebel leaders could not be reached for comment at
their diplomatic offices in Mexico City.

   Five sets of remains belonging to Vietnam-era
servicemen have been identified by the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory, the U.S. Pacific Command said Monday.
   The remains of Navy Cmdr. Frank C. Elkins of Bladenboro, N.C.,
who was lost in North Vietnam on Oct. 12, 1966, were among 28
repatriated by Vietnam on June 21, 1989. Nine of those remains have
been identified.
   The other four Americans were among 25 repatriated on Jan. 23,
1989. Seven of those remains have been identified.
   Three of the remains, all Army soldiers lost in South Vietnam on
Dec. 2, 1969, were identified as Chief Warrant Officer William C.
Dunlap of Tucson, Ariz.; Chief Warrant Officer Martin D. Vanden
Eykel II of Wheaton, Ill.; and Staff Sgt. William D. Sanderlin of
Fort Worth, Texas.
   The name of the fifth serviceman was withheld at the request of
his family, the army said.
   The remains were scheduled to leave Hickam Air Force Base here
for Travis Air Force Base, Calif., on Tuesday to begin their final
journey home.

<HEAD>Pregnant Cancer Victim Declines Treatment to Save Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pregnant cancer patient who refused
chemical and radiation therapy so the fetus wouldn't be harmed gave
birth to a boy, and mother and child appeared to be doing well
Monday.
   ``This baby is perfect,'' Linda Babcock said from her room at
St. Joseph Medical Center in this central Illinois city. ``To think
that I might have aborted him. I think I would have died, too.''
   The Clinton woman, who has three other children ages 8 to 18 and
said she was in her 30s, was diagnosed last August as having
inoperable form of lung cancer known as oat cell carcinoma.
   Untreated, her chances appeared slim.
   ``Textbooks say untreated oat cell cancer patients will live two
to four months,'' said Dr. James Wade III, director of medical
oncology-hematology at Decatur Memorial Hospital.
   ``The chances of her being able to deliver the baby without
treatment are slim,'' he said during the pregnancy.
   On Friday, Dr. Harold A. Nord of Bloomington delivered Jesse
Warren Babcock, weighing 5 pounds and 6 ounces.
   ``It's pretty incredible that if she has oat cell carcinoma, as
the tests have shown, that she went throughout pregnancy without
her physical condition deteriorating,'' Nord said Monday. ``In
fact, in the last few weeks, she seemed to be getting better.
   ``I was amazed. ... This is the first time I've had a patient
who had this condition _ known to be fatal _ and survived,'' said
Nord, who has been in obstetrics for seven years.
   Mrs. Babcock said an X-ray was taken after the delivery and she
was told her condition was unchanged. ``It hasn't changed since the
very first diagnosis,'' she said.
   But Mrs. Babcock said she believes she no longer has cancer and
will continue to do without normal therapy.
   ``I feel so much better,'' she said. ``I can breathe. I could
tell it was there before. It felt like something cutting off my
air, taking my life.''
   After the diagnosis last summer, Mrs. Babcock faced hard
choices: Should she undergo conventional radiation and chemical
cancer therapy, which could extend her life but harm the baby?
Should she forgo treatment and hope for the best? Should she have
an abortion?
   After agonizing about the choices with her husband, George, a
control technician at a nuclear power plant, Mrs. Babcock decided:
No chemotherapy. No radiation treatment. No abortion.
   She adopted a program based on nutrition: lots of carrot juice,
organically grown vegetables and fruits, plenty of purified water,
lots of vitamin pills _ and faith in God.
   ``Sometimes the art of medicine is not so certain,'' Nord said
after the successful birth.
   ``Give God the credit,'' Mrs. Babcock said. ``He guided me,
through people I met, books I read. So many people helped me,
prayed for me. I'll never be able to thank them enough.''
   Mrs. Babcock and her baby are to go home Tuesday.
   ``I'm confident of living, of beating the cancer,'' she said.
``The baby saved me from death as I saved him.''

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five men kidnapped a mayor in northern
Colombia Monday, and she was found dead hours later in a parked car
with eight bullet wounds, most to the head, police said.
   The army reported that soldiers surprised leftist guerrillas
preparing to blow up a section of the nation's main oil pipeline on
Sunday and killed four rebels.
   The mayor of Apartado, Diana Cardona, had said in an interview
in November that she had received several death threats from
paramilitary groups in the region, which borders Panama.
   Five men subdued the bodyguard police assigned to her, then
forced the 31-year-old woman into a car Monday morning as she left
her home in Medellin bound for nearby Apartado, a police communique
said.
   It did not mention the fate of the bodyguard.
   Ms. Cardona, a lawyer and member of the leftist Patriotic Union
party, was appointed mayor less than a year ago after another
member of the party, Ramon Castillo, fled the country because of
death threats.
   Police had said earlier they suspected leftist guerrillas in the
kidnapping of the mayor.
   Rebels have never been to known to harm anyone from the
Patriotic Union, and the party is known to have ties to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces guerrilla group.
   Apartado is in the Uraba region, where authorities have blamed
right-wing death squads for several massacres of peasants and union
leaders.
   An army statement said soldiers took one prisoner and two
soldiers were wounded in the pipeline fight with guerrillas of the
National Liberation Army near Toledo, 250 miles northeast of Bogota.
   The attack would have been the ninth this year on the pipeline,
which runs from the Cano Limon field on the Venezuela border to the
Caribbean port of Covenas. Previous bombings this year cost $40
million in repairs and lost production, said Andres Restrepo
Londono, president of the state oil company Ecopetrol.
   Guerrillas of the National Liberation Army began attacking oil
facilities in 1986. Restrepo assessed total damage since then at
$512 million.

   The main street through South Florida's largest
Nicaraguan neighborhood was closed to traffic Monday night as
thousands of jubilant exiles celebrated the upset victory of
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro over the Sandinista regime.
   An estimated 8,000 Nicaraguans and other Hispanics converged on
Sweetwater to dance and sing patriotic anthems, said Charles
Toledo, police chief of the community west of Miami. Many, however,
said they want to see the new government in action before deciding
whether to return.
   ``Democracy is on its way back,'' said a jubilant Inez de
Gutierrez, who nonetheless conceded she would not return
immediately.
   ``We'll just wait a while and see how things go in Nicaragua,
politically and economically,'' said Mrs. de Gutierrez, a
31-year-old cashier who has been in the United States for a year
with her husband and young daughter.
   ``The country is in ruins. It's in great poverty, now.''
   Police closed a five-block stretch of busy Flagler Street, which
was clogged earlier in the evening with cars blaring horns and
filled with flag-waving Nicaraguans, many of whom did not sleep
since voting began Sunday morning.
   Many Nicaraguan exiles elsewhere in the United States also
expressed astonishment and joy at the election outcome but some
were skeptical that the Sandinistas would relinquish power.
   In Sweetwater, a group of Nicaraguan businessmen passed around a
facsimile sent from Managua showing a dart board superimposed over
a drawing of Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega.
   Ricardo Teran, whose family operates a retail and
telecommunications conglomerate in Nicaragua, said he will return
to Nicaragua next week to assess prospects of relocating
permanently.
   ``Up until five hours ago, our total investment in Nicaragua was
zero. The government had control of everything. Now, we're going to
see if it's worth starting to build up the business again,'' he
said.
   Renato Salazar said he will not be ready to return to his
homeland until the Sandinistas relinquish control of the military
and police forces.
   ``Democracy means total democracy, not the government being in
charge of one part and the opposition in control of the army,'' he
said.
   More than 100,000 Nicaraguans have resettled in south Florida
since the Sandinista revolution in 1979.
   Opposition leaders were also pleased, but wanted to see what
would happen next.
   Aristides Sanchez, a member of the Contras' ruling
Civilian-Military Commission, appealed to all Nicaraguans to ``back
the new government and attempt to achieve a national
reconciliation.''
   Adolfo Calero, former director of the U.S.-backed rebels,
predicted the return of exiles to Nicaragua would be slow.
   ``There are mass exoduses, but no mass returns to a country,''
said Calero, who now works with the Nicaraguan American National
Foundation. ``Slowly, the Nicaraguan exiles will go back to the
country. I'm going back as soon as I get a passport from the
country.
   ``I think the armed struggle is over,'' Calero said. ``The armed
struggle was never an end in itself, it was always a means to force
the Sandinistas into a political contest which the people won,
headed by Violeta Chamorro.''
   Immigration attorney Robert Boyer, who has been a legal adviser
to Nicaraguans seeking asylum, predicted a high percentage of
Nicaraguans, if they know that things will be safe and secure and
will be able to establish themselves economically, will go back to
Nicaragua.
   In Los Angeles, Luciano Cuadra, 32, of the Organization of
Nicaraguans in Exile and a onetime Sandinista intelligence officer,
said he had predicted Sunday that the leftist government almost
certainly would win.
   ``I have never been happier to have been mistaken,'' he said.
   He said it could be months, however, before the world knows if
the Sandinistas truly have relinquished power.
   ``Up to this moment, I'm still a skeptic,'' he said.
   At Casa Oscar Romero, a Catholic-funded shelter for Central
Americans near Brownsville, Texas, Nicaraguans largely welcomed the
election results but worried that the Sandinista army will not
respect the vote.
   ``The results were good, but it's a lie,'' said Barbara Zapata,
26, who left Managua five months ago. ``Daniel (Ortega) will not
turn in the weapons.''

   President Daniel Ortega said Monday
his Sandinistas will honor the voters' wishes and surrender power
to a 6-month-old opposition alliance that won an upset victory
after a decade of one-party rule.
   ``We leave victorious because the Sandinistas have sacrificed,
spilled blood and sweat, not to cling to government posts, but to
bring Nicaragua something denied since 1821,'' when it declared
independence from Spain, he said in a dramatic dawn speech.
   Ortega spoke hours after it was clear the electoral tide was
against him and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher of the
opposition newspaper La Prensa, would be the next president of this
battle-scarred nation, which has in the past decade become one of
the poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
   Later Monday, Ortega went to Mrs. Chamorro's home for a brief
congratulatory visit. Ortega, accompanied by several foreign
observers, including former President Jimmy Carter, hugged Mrs.
Chamorro, who called him ``my darling.''
   Ortega replied, ``You know that I respect you, and that I love
you and congratulate you on your victory.''
   ``In this election there weren't any victors or losers. What I
want is that we all work for the reconciliation of Nicaragua,'' she
said.
   ``I am ready to contribute to the national reconciliation,''
Ortega said.
   Earlier, as she headed for a victory celebration at her campaign
headquarters, Mrs. Chamorro said simply, ``People wanted a change.''
   With 82 percent of the precincts counted, Mrs. Chamorro had
633,357 votes, or 55.2 percent, to 468,040, or 40.8 percent for
Ortega, with the other 4 percent going to minor candidates, the
Supreme Electoral Council said. The coalition also won a majority
in the National Assembly.
   Mrs. Chamorro is to take office April 25 and the transition
could be difficult, given the bad blood between winners and losers.
On leaving office, Ortega is to become a member of the National
Assembly.
   After a day of calm following the election, there were at least
two violent incidents after nightfall Monday, including rock- and
bottle-throwing between inebriated Sandinista and UNO supporters.
   Crowds of about 50 on each side were screaming insults at each
other across a street in western Managua; only five or six actually
tossed objects.
   About 150 riot police called to the scene dispersed the crowd
with tear gas and night sticks. One person suffered a head injury.
   In the provincial capital of Leon, Sandinista militants attacked
and occupied the local UNO headquarters, according to a Sandinista
party official.
   The Sandinista supporters left the UNO house when Sandinista
officials went to the scene and asked the militants to accept their
defeat with maturity.
   There were no reports of injuries.
   ``It's going to be a bit harder than the normal transition,''
said Alfredo Cesar, one of Mrs. Chamorro's closest advisers and a
former leader of the Contra rebels. ``That means the two sides .. .
will sit down and make sure the transition is accomplished in a
peaceful manner.''
   There was elation at the White House. ``In this year of
political change, democracy won another victory,'' President Bush
said in a statement, and officials said lifting the U.S. economic
embargo was under discussion.
   Ronald Reagan, in whose administration the Contras were
organized and went to war, issued a statement saying: ``The people
of Nicaragua and the cause of democracy have won an impressive and
important victory.''
   In Riverside, Calif., Vice President Dan Quayle praised the
U.S.-supported forces that tried to overthrow the Sandinistas,
saying, ``The Contras were an important force throughout to bring
democracy.''
   Under the Sandinistas, Nicaragua became a self-proclaimed
revolutionary state and adopted portions of Marxist and Leninist
ideology to remake its economic and social structures. It won
strong support from the Soviet Union and Cuba, and was accused by
the United States of trying to foment a Communist revolution in
neighboring El Salvador.
   The Sandinista loss to the United National Opposition, which is
known as UNO and favors Western-style representative government,
followed by months the movement toward democracy in a several
Soviet-aligned nations of East Europe and democratization in the
Soviet Union itself.
   ``We have a whole new political landscape in Central America
today. We have democracy on the march and dictators on the
decline,'' Quayle said, adding that the region's anti-democratic
axis of Cuba, Nicaragua and Panama has been reduced to just Cuba.
   ``Today we have democracy in Panama, yesterday people voted for
democracy in Nicaragua, and now only one remains.''
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro presented themselves as candidates
of national reconciliation and economic recovery, Ortega because he
believed the United States would recognize his victory and Mrs.
Chamorro because she had Washington's support.
   She promised economic recovery to a nation that suffered from a
decade of war, a debilitating U.S. economic embargo and poor
management.
   Ortega and the Sandinistas mounted a carefully orchestrated
campaign that ended with a rally attended by an estimated 300,000
people. The man who marched into Managua as a victorious young
revolutionary in July 1979 had not expected to lose, and the first
hours of the stunning upset were tense.
   Former President Jimmy Carter was among thousands of
international election observers who monitored the voting.
   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president's brother, and
Interior Minister Tomas Borge, who controls the police, had
suggested they might not give an opposition government control of
those forces.
   Daniel Ortega said he spoke for his party and government,
however, in promising to honor the results.
   ``I want to tell all Nicaraguans and all the nations of the
world that the president of Nicaragua and the government will
respect and submit itself to the popular mandate,'' he said.
   Most polls had shown Ortega ahead, but the results always were
in question because many people refused to express their opinions
to strangers.
   Paul Reichler, an American lawyer and one of Ortega's close
advisers, said: ``I think that, when people went to vote, they
voted with their stomachs, and I think they thought about the empty
stomachs of their children.''
   ``I think when it came right down to it, Nicaraguans has just
suffered enough. They had suffered too much.''
   In opposition, the Sandinistas will be the largest and
best-organized party in Nicaragua.
   ``It's a hell of an opposition force in any democracy,'' said
Cesar. ``They are going to have their own rights, their own space.
Ortega will be treated as a former president, with all the dignity
that entails.''
   Ortega said the Sandinistas had created ``an independent,
dignified and sovereign Nicaragua with economic and social
development and with complete democracy.''
   Throughout the campaign, Ortega equated the opposition alliance
with the Somoza dictatorship the Sandinistas overthrew.
   He and Mrs. Chamorro served on the first junta after the late
President Anastasio Somoza was ousted, but she resigned after nine
months and later accused the Sandinistas of betraying promises of
pluralism.
   Her coalition consists of 14 political parties and one native
Indian organization that span the poltical spectrum.
   Ortega called the election and invited the international
observers that made it the freest in Nicaraguan history and perhaps
the most closely monitored anywhere.
   The election was part of a Central American peace agreement that
also involves disbanding the Contras.

   A new judge was picked Monday to hear the
retrial of McMartin preschool defendant Raymond Buckey, who faces
13 child molestation counts left over from the nation's longest
criminal trial.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg, known for his efficiency
in moving cases along, will hear the retrial scheduled to start
March 9, court officials said.
   Buckey, 31, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63, were
acquitted on 53 charges of child molestation in January, but the
Superior Court jury deadlocked on 13 other counts against Raymond
Buckey.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders presided over that trial,
which lasted nearly three years.
   Reports of child molestation at the McMartin Pre-School
triggered a wave of hysteria in Southern California. The case
lingered in the courts in various stages for nearly seven years,
and cost more than $15 million.
   Weisberg is to meet with prosecutors and defense attorneys in a
pretrial hearing Wednesday.

the fifth time, the most delays since the doomed Challenger.
   NASA set the next attempt for early Wednesday.
   Peekaboo clouds and erratic winds tantalized NASA with possible

   But the break never came. At 2:32 a.m. launch director Robert

   Despite ominous government warnings and a high
police profile, pro-democracy activists marched by the hundreds of
thousands in more than 30 Soviet cities to demand an end to
one-party Communist rule.
   The rallies Sunday, unprecedented in scope in the Communists'
72-year rule, came a day after voters in the independence-minded
republic of Lithuania apparently stripped the Communists of their
parliamentary majority. The day also saw republic-wide elections in
another restive republic _ Moldavia.
   A series of official warnings last week that extremists would
provoke violence kept the turnout low in some cities Sunday and
prevented some protests altogether. Riot police dragged away people
who tried to hold an unsanctioned demonstration in Leningrad, but
there were no reports of major unrest.
   ``We heard about tanks, about police waiting with gas and
shovels,'' said a middle-aged woman who was not deterred from
demonstrating Sunday in Moscow along with more than 100,000 people.

   President Bush and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, following ``extraordinarily frank'' talks at Camp
David, say the world has nothing to fear from a united Germany and
promise it will stay tethered to the Western military alliance.
   Emerging Sunday from two days of talks at the presidential
retreat, Bush and Kohl sought to allay fears from Moscow to Warsaw
to London that the two Germanys are marching to the altar too
rapidly.
   Bush said they shared ``a common belief that a unified Germany
should remain a full member of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, including participation in its military structure,''
but with ``a special military status'' for the territory of what is
now East Germany.
   Kohl, without mentioning NATO by name, said, ``The alliance of
free democracies in Europe and North America ... are of fundamental
importance for peace and security. This is true now. This will be
true in the future.''

   At issue in a case from Bowie, Md., is a federal regulation

   President Bush is meeting with the nation's

state leaders' revisions to his goals for U.S. schools to meet by
the year 2000.
   Leaders of the National Governors Association predicted an
amicable meeting today since they made only minor changes in Bush's
six goals. Their proposal to give education a share of any savings
in defense spending was relegated to a resolution one governor said
was so bland no one could object.
   ``I expect full well for the president to endorse what the
governors have approved,'' NGA Chairman Terry Branstad of Iowa said
after the group approved the changes on Sunday.
   Later, at a dinner for the governors at the White House, Bush
toasted them and ``our commitment to work together toward ... an

   Tickets containing all six winning numbers in the California
Lottery's weekend ``Lotto 6-49'' game were sold in the cities of
Eureka and Carlsbad, lottery officials said Sunday, and each is
worth $3,186,409.
   There were six tickets containing five winning numbers and the
bonus number, and each was worth $282,498. The tickets were
purchased in South Gate, Newhall, Los Angeles, Baker, Covina and
Modesto.
   The winning numbers were: 44, 30, 33, 18, 36, 49 and the bonus
number, 43. The numbers are listed in the order they were
announced, but any combination would win.
   There were 277 tickets sold with five of six winning numbers,
and each ticket was worth $3,152. Some 14,012 tickets with four of
six winning numbers paid off at $56 each, and the 260,149 tickets
with three of six winning numbers were worth an automatic $5 each.
   Saturday night's televised drawing was delayed for 50 minutes by
what officials first thought was a breakdown of the machine that
spits out the balls containing the winning numbers.
   ``It was human error,'' California Lottery spokeswoman Carolyn
Walker said later.
   She said a person who was supposed to press three buttons on the
machine that randomly selects the numbers forgot to press the third
button in the sequence.
   The buttons cause the numbered balls to drop out of the machine.
Citizens are chosen randomly to press the buttons that release the
numbered balls for the twice-weekly drawing, Ms. Walker said,
because lottery employees are prohibited from starting the drawing.
   Lottery officials already had stopped the 7:55 p.m. statewide
broadcast of the drawing before they realized what went wrong, Ms.
Walker said. When the final button was finally pressed, the balls
dropped normally.
   Security cameras in the Sacramento TV studio made the required
videotape of the drawing, so it is valid even though it wasn't
broadcast live, she said.
   Sales from Wednesday night to Saturday's drawing were
$15,878,153. Wednesday's lottery jackpot is expected to be worth
about $5 million.

<HEAD>Senate Tussles Over Armenian Genocide Resolution</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those resolutions Congress routinely passes to
mark one occasion or another usually get about as much attention as
confetti, and have the same impact.
   But there are exceptions. Even ceremonial measures sometimes
echo far from the Capitol.
   That's why the Senate has been snarled in a polite filibuster,
spending long hours in debate on a joint resolution that would
designate April 24 as a National Day of Remembrance of the 75th
Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923.
   On one side of the issue stands Sen. Robert J. Dole, R-Kan., the
minority leader, urging adoption of a resolution the Republican
administration opposes even though President Bush endorsed a
commemorative measure when he was a candidate in 1988.
   On the other is Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the senior
Democrat in the Senate, former majority and minority leader, who
insists that the measure is a pointless and potentially damaging
condemnation of Turkey, and that approval could do serious harm to
relations with a vital NATO ally.
   The resolution would have Congress ask Bush to issue a
proclamation calling on Americans to observe April 24 as a day of
remembrance for more than 1.5 million Armenian victims of
massacres, starvation and deportation in the waning days of the
Ottoman Empire.
   It doesn't blame modern Turkey for what happened 70 years ago,
saying it was genocide ``perpetrated by the governments of the
Ottoman empire from 1915 to 1923, prior to the establishment of the
Republic of Turkey.''
   But Turkey has called the resolution offensive, insulting and
unwarranted.
   The administration opposes it because of the potential
diplomatic and NATO problem. Dole has offered to revise his
resolution and make it a purely congressional matter, one that
wouldn't require the president's signature and wouldn't be a real
law. He said Bush would support that version.
   At the same time, Dole said Turkey isn't going to risk
undercutting its own interests, and about $500 million in U.S. aid,
because of the resolution.
   Commemorative resolutions usually pass with little debate and no
dissent, noticed only by the groups and interests that wanted them
adopted in the first place. But some do echo in foreign capitals.
   A 1989 Senate resolution criticizing Yugoslavia for mistreatment
of ethnic Albanians was adopted with little notice, and temporarily
soured relations. Yugoslavia's ambassador to Washington was called
home for consultations in a gesture of protest.
   Earlier measures on such matters as Chinese actions in Tibet and
drug problems in Mexico also have stirred protests in foreign
ministries. Beijing bitterly opposed congressional sanctions
stirred by its suppression of democratic dissenters, even though
Bush promised to keep similar measures in force by executive order.
   For years, Congress routinely adopted resolutions designating
captive nation observances, declaring that it would not recognize
the Soviet Union's annexation of once-independent states or its
control in eastern Europe. That irked Moscow but accomplished
little else.
   When former President Gerald R. Ford tripped over the topic in
1976 presidential campaign debate, insisting that there was no
Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, he was simply echoing the old
captive nations resolutions he backed in his House days.
   Dole pointed to the China sanctions in accusing some opponents
of his Armenia resolution of adopting a double standard, pushing
for action to rebuke Beijing while resisting the observance he
seeks.
   But there is a difference between a commemoration and an signal
of opposition to current conduct.
   ``What useful purpose can this resolution serve at this late
date?'' Byrd asked. ``Historians and scholars should deal with the
matter, not politicians.''
   Dole's special concern about Armenia traces in part to the
Armenian doctor who treated him for the serious wounds he suffered
in World War II combat. He and his wife, Secretary of Labor
Elizabeth Dole, traveled to what is now Soviet Armenia last August.
Dole said he then ``had to scrounge around'' to arrange $5 million
in U.S. aid for an area devastated by an earthquake that killed as
many as 50,000 people, and, more recently, menaced by ethnic
violence.
   Byrd contended that the resolution could further inflame the
ancient enmities behind that violence.
   Dole's first attempt to crack the filibuster failed last
Thursday, on a 49-49 vote. It takes 60 to halt debate, and he's
trying again this week.
   No matter what happens on that vote, the argument won't be over.

   The first order of business for the United
States in the 1990s seems to be getting rid of the detritus of the
`80s.
   That theme applies in literal terms, to the pollutants, garbage
and deterioration left over from a long period of exuberant
consumption and ``fast track'' living.
   No coincidence, then, that environmental cleanup and waste
management rank high on just about any forecaster's list of growth
industries for the new decade.
   The principle also extends, in a figurative sense, to clearing
away what's left of many financial and commercial ventures of the
past 10 years that have either gone sour or simply worn out their
welcome.
   Thus we have the government's program to try to sell assets of
hundreds of failed savings institutions, and the sudden departure
of Drexel Burnham Lambert from the Wall Street scene.
   Such ``spring cleanings'' in the economy are usually painful,
rancorous and expensive. Just ask the people who lose their jobs in
the process, or the taxpayers who often wind up footing the bill.
But if all goes according to plan, they are supposed to produce
beneficial results too.
   That's the way it happened 10 years ago, when the economy went
in for its last full-scale overhaul.
   Then the primary target for purging was rapid inflation left
over from the stagnant '70s. The measures employed were drastic _ a
new economic philosophy, a new tax system, and even the ouster of
an incumbent president, Jimmy Carter.
   Whether by chance or by design, the effort succeeded, opening
the way for a durable economic boom.
   Now the chief villain, almost everyone agrees, is debt: Federal
budget-deficit debt, corporate takeover debt, ill-advised bank
debt, real estate debt, and consumer debt.
   As the bill from the savings and loan debacle mounts in
multimillion-dollar increments, observes economist Edward Yardeni
at Prudential-Bache Securities, ``the financial system is a mess.''
   It remains to be seen just how difficult, or maybe even
dangerous, the cleanup will be. But there is abundant evidence that
it already has begun with what Rao Chalasani, an analyst at the
investment firm of Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc., describes as
``market-induced credit rationing.''
   Once-bold lenders of many types, ranging from large banks to
small investors eager to buy shares of junk-bond mutual funds, have
turned very stingy with their money.
   That point was driven home when Drexel Burnham, one of the prime
promoters and beneficiaries of the debt boom, expired when its own
supply of credit was cut off. Neither private financial
institutions nor government regulators showed any interest in
coming to the firm's rescue.
   ``Credit rationing is a result of the abuses of the past, and a
needed cleansing process,'' Chalasani maintains. It may well hurt
economic output short-term, he says, ``but it increases the
long-term stability of the economy.''
   As in many another free-market shakeup, what looms as a crisis
for many has also been perceived as an opportunity for others.
   The rising star at a financial firm these days, displacing the
traders and deal-brokers of yore, may be a ``workout'' specialist
who tries to salvage something of value from a bad real estate
investment or a failed business buyout.
   Martin Sass, president of a New York money-management firm that
bears his name, sees a basic investment theme for the 1990s in
``distressed'' bonds and real estate properties that might sooner
or later recover at least some of their lost market value.
   Though a strategy of that kind naturally involves risks, he
says, ``With storm clouds looming as we head into the 1990s, we
believe the most timely and attractive opportunities are emerging
from what might be termed the wreckage of the 1980s.''

   It's not every day you see 35 mandolin
players performing Ravel, or a band called Brave Combo playing the
Doors' ``People Are Strange'' in its own unique style of rock polka.
   But that's part of the uniqueness of public TV's ``Lonesome Pine
Specials'' series.
   The series, co-produced by the Kentucky Center for the Arts and
Kentucky Educational Television, is a musical odyssey that looks at
all forms of music and dance in different, often whimsical, ways.
   The one on tap for Saturday features The ISOBOBS, a combination
of two four-member groups _ The Bobs, new wave a capella singers,
and ISO, whose members are dancers and new wave vaudevillians.
   ``Lonesome Pine,'' which began its second PBS season in January,
might sound as if it got its title from an ode to a forlorn fir.
   ``The name comes from a song written by Sarah Carter,'' says
Richard Van Kleeck, the series' artistic director. ``It's a
metaphor for a train ... a vehicle to take you places in the arts,
and to bring them to you.''
   The series, which makes 11 shows a year at a cost of $50,000
each, now is going abroad. Great Britain's Channel 4 in London has
bought it, according to Van Kleeck, who also is the show's
co-producer.
   Begun four years ago by KET, ``Lonesome Pine'' has featured such
performers as veteran tap dancer Howard ``Sandman'' Sims, New
Orleans soul queen Irma Thomas and blues-guitar master Walter
``Wolfman'' Washington, and Nigel Kennedy, the British classical,
jazz and pop violin virtuoso.
   They might not necessarily be well-known names, but the series'
producers hope to change that.
   ``Our goal has always been to present artists that have been
ignored by the media _ public television in particular,'' says Van
Kleeck. ``Some of these are actually old artists, even legendary,
who have sort of been passed by and never got the notice they were
due.''
   The ensemble performances have included ``Masters of
Percussion,'' with 12 drummers showing off the varied forms of the
drum.
   Another show due in March, ``Strength in Numbers,'' will feature
five top Nashville studio session players playing violin, banjo,
mandolin, acoustic bass and dobro. They'll perform what Van Vleeck
describes as country and jazz chamber music.
   On one occasion, Van Kleeck has gotten in the act. That was
during the series' 35-mandolin extravaganza, ``Mando Magnificat,''
being sent again to PBS stations on March 24.
   That show began with a single mandolin player. When the
mandolinists had multiplied to a full orchestra, having played
works ranging from classical to ragtime, they got a conductor _ Van
Kleeck, a French horn player who studied at the New England
Conservatory of Music.
   The ``Lonesome Pine'' shows are taped at the Kentucky Center in
July and August. After that, producer-directer Russ Farmer and his
staff start the editing, mixing and dubbing that leads to the
finished series.
   Farmer, with KET for 16 years, says the beauty of the series
lies in its variety.
   ``It's like what they say about Kentucky's weather,'' he says.
``If you don't like it, wait a minute and it'll change. ... It's
such an eclectic series that there's got to be something there that
you'll like.''

   ONCE AGAIN, IT'S ANDY ROONEY TIME: A spokeswoman for ``A Current
Affair'' says the syndicated show tonight will report results of
the call-in poll in which it sought viewers' opinions on the
three-month suspension of CBS humorist Andy Rooney. Rooney was
suspended after a gay magazine attributed a racial slur to him. He
denies making the slur.
   CBS News, which hasn't held a call-in poll, has gotten calls
about the Rooney case, anyway. CBS says that as of Feb. 16, its
latest count, 5,061 callers supported Rooney, while 72 praised his
suspension.

   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has
become a matter of government concern. Legislation that would ban,
restrict or discourage the use of disposable diapers is being
considered in a dozen or so states. The environment is at stake,
proponents say. Mothers would be the big losers, corn farmers
perhaps the big winners.

   It was test marketed in 1961 in, where else,
Peoria, Ill.
   And, oh, how it played.
   The disposable diaper. In the years since, it has been improved:
elasticized legs, gels, super absorbency, the anatomically more
efficient his and hers versions.
   It has become a $3.5 billion-a-year industry, with 85 percent of
America's mothers using them.
   But the disposable diaper has become a prime target of angry
environmentalists who consider it the very symbol of the ills of a
throwaway society. The problem is what to do with it once it has
done its job. Throwaway diapers clog up the waste stream.
   The way a mother covers her baby's bottom has become a subject
of hot debate in statehouses and city halls. It has generated piles
of studies, reports and pamphlets. Who would have thought the
manufacturers of disposable diapers would have to go to such
lengths to defend such a wonder product?
   Bills either to ban, restrict or tax disposable diapers are
before the legislatures of about a dozen states.
   On the other hand, the controversy has breathed new life into
the diaper service business, and could prove a boon to corn farmers.
   The rub is, although disposable diapers account for only 2
percent of the nation's trash, they will last 500 years in a
landfill. One proposed solution is the more-expensive biodegradable
diaper, and that's where the corn farmers come in.
   Jeanne Wirka, a solid-waste reduction expert with the
Environmental Action Foundation, says the disposable diaper is the
largest single one-use product for which there is a readily
available alternative _ cloth diapers.
   But the convenience factor is extraordinary. Many day care
centers, for example, will not accept youngsters in cloth diapers.
   And if everyone switched to cloth tomorrow, there would be
chaos. There are not enough cloth diapers nor cloth diaper services
in the country to accommodate them. In environmentally hip
Washington, D.C., 400 people are on the waiting list for the one
diaper service in town.
   The National Association of Diaper Services, after years of
decline, reports a 38 percent increase in business last year and a
13 percent rise the year before. The disposable diaper giants,
however, say they see no blip yet on their sales screen.
   The debate has produced strange bedfellows. The six most active
environmental groups and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark
Corp., the disposable diaper manufacturers who control 75 percent
of the market, agree that biodegradable diapers are not the answer.
   The environmentalists called for a boycott of degradable diapers
in mid-December, saying their use only assuages the conscience of
consumers who use them. Biodegradable diapers don't decompose in
landfills because there is not enough moisture or oxygen, they say.
   Taking an opposing view is the National Association of Corn
Growers, based in St. Louis. Cornstarch is used in the degradables
and this could open up a market of 150 million to 300 million
bushels a year for the nation's corn farmers, spokesman Tim Draeger
says.
   So far, the only state to enact any legislation has been
Nebraska, which passed a law last session requiring the use of
biodegradables by 1993. Nebraska, it might be noted, is the
nation's third-largest corn producing state, just behind Iowa and
Illinois.
   Draeger argues that if the biodegradable diaper technology was
improved, it would mean America would be less dependent on foreign
oil.
   ``We are in the infancy of this technology,'' he says. ``We are
at the Model T level. We have to learn to walk before we can run.''
   Ms. Wirka says that's plain silly. The amount of ``foreign oil''
in diapers is negligible and the so-called degradables also use
some.
   Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble, with a $1.65 billion slice of
the disposable pie _ compared to Kimberly-Clark's $840 million _
has taken a much higher profile in its fight to keep baby's bottom
in Pampers and Luvs, its products.
   Although close-mouthed about the money it is spending on the
diaper wars, P&amp;G is sponsoring two well-publicized projects, one in
Seattle demonstrating that plastic diapers can be recycled and
another in St. Cloud, Minn., showing diapers can be composted. The
Seattle project is reputed to be a $500,000 venture.
   ``If you could throw that kind of money at every segment of the
trash problem in America, we wouldn't have a trash problem,'' says
Jeffrey Tryens of the Council for Policy Alternatives, a
Washington-based environmental group. ``It's just good PR for
Procter and Gamble.''
   Wirka, however, thinks the St. Cloud project may have some
merit, although she says, ``That recycling project is just bogus.
   ``Procter &amp; Gamble is in a difficult position. They are always
the target here and they are applying their corporate good guy
image on something that is economically very dubious. I'm more
willing to say that the composting project is a more fruitful use
of their resources.''
   P&amp;G, it should be noted, has been a leader in recycling plastic
bottles for its products, selling refills for the same plastic
bottle and marketing concentrates in smaller bottles where the
consumer just needs to add water. Its soaps are also biodegradable.
   Since the diaper wars started making the nightly news shows,
politicians have gotten bolder. Tryens says he called a meeting
about a year ago, inviting legislators, lobbyists,
environmentalists and others concerned about the issue.
   ``At that time, nobody even considered discussing a statewide
ban,'' he says. ``The feeling was that no respectable politician
would even propose such legislation and that it just wouldn't fly.''
   Yet, one year later, the state of Vermont is proposing just such
legislation as part of a much larger environmental bill. If passed,
no disposable diapers would be sold in Vermont after 1993.
   Nancy Alexander of New Haven, Conn., is one who's profiting by
it all. She started her own cloth diaper service in January and
says clients are flocking to her door.
   ``I've always wanted to go into my own business and this just
sort of fell into my lap,'' she says. ``What's more is that all of
my clients treat me like I'm some kind of a hero.''
   One of her clients with a newborn baby said her 4-year-old was
watching her change the baby with a disposable diaper and had a
quizzical look on her face.
   ``What is it?'' asked the mother.
   ``Why don't they invent a diaper you could just wash and use
over and over?'' asked the child.

   Bills to discourage the use of disposable
diapers are being debated in the legislatures of a dozen states,
with an outright ban proposed in Vermont.
   But most of the proposed legislation is given little hope of
becoming law, at least this year. In Florida, a bill was withdrawn
for more study.
   Most of the proposals call for putting a tax on throwaway
diapers, except in corn-growing states where biodegradable diapers
are being pushed because corn is used in their manufacture.
   In Colorado, for instance, a bill that would have taxed
disposables one-fourth of one cent per diaper was sent off to three
committees, usually the kiss of death.
   ``That baby's going to go down like a burning kite, if I know
the Colorado Legislature,'' commented one veteran reporter.
   He knew his legislature. The bill was killed in its first day of
hearings.
   A bill in New Hampshire, co-sponsored by Deborah Arnie Arnesen,
a Democrat from Orford, would put a 10-cent-per-diaper tax on the
disposables. And, no, she doesn't think it's going through this
time.
   ``This is a very industrial state,'' says the mother of four.
``Procter and Gamble could come in here and run for governor and
win. We don't even have a bottle law. It would be almost irrational
for something to pass the first time around. There isn't enough
time to assess the situation.''
   Isn't a 10-cent tax a little steep?
   ``It's politics,'' she says. ``You ask for the sun, the moon and
the stars and then you compromise down.
   ``When it gets to the point that a family may save $15 a week by
using a diaper service, and when some good marketers come in here,
then maybe people will start to use cloth diapers at least part of
the time.''
   Ms. Arnesen says she would be the first to fight against a
statewide ban.
   ``You can't ignore the convenience factor,'' she says. ``When I
brought my 5-week-old daughter to the legislature with me, I wasn't
about to ask committee members to sit in a smelly room. It was
enough they put up with the baby.''
   Other states that have or are considering legislation include
New York, Connecticut, Oregon, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Washington,
Hawaii, Ohio and Kentucky.

   NEW YORK _ Even friends disagree about disposable diapers,
especially if they're mothers.
   Sandie Lange of St. Paul, Minn., an environmentally conscious
new mother, lasted about three weeks using cloth diapers when her
first child, a daughter named Kristen, was born.
   ``It was just too much,'' reports the 23-year-old mother. ``I'll
recycle all of my newspapers, wash out all of my cans and bottles,
but I'm not going back to the '50s.''
   Sandie says that when her former supervisor, herself the mother
of two, picks up little Kristen, she often frowns and says, ``Oh,
no, she's in Pampers again.''
   ``We get into little arguments, but they're not serious,''
reports Sandie. ``You know, she's a save the whales kind of person.
She uses cloth diapers on both of her children. It just didn't work
out for us.''

   A study commissioned by the diaper service
industry suggests disposable diapers may harbor bacteria that cause
polio, meningitis and hepatitis.
   Not so, says T. Scott Stewart, chief spokesman for Procter &amp;
Gamble, a major manufacturer of disposble diapers.
   Stewart says the National Association of Diaper Services paid
$15,000 for that study and it has been discredited. Nonetheless the
suggestion continues to crop up in news stories about the great
diaper wars.
   Environmentalist Jeanne Wirka claims the report has not been
discredited and research is continuing.
   However, Stewart has on his side the fact that there is no
evidence that any case of polio, hepatitis or meningitis was ever
caused by disposable diapers and some European countries have been
using them for 50 years.
   He also says there is 1,000 times more pet fecal matter entombed
in landfills than infant leavings on the disposable diaper.

   The massacre of six Jesuit priests and educators
in El Salvador in November underscored the danger facing hundreds
of clergymen and church workers of all denominations in the
volatile Central American country. Their work in the shantytowns
and refugee camps has cast many of them in the role of enemies of
the far-right.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Their lives are in daily peril,
these men and women of various religious orders who work among the
poor and disenfranchised on the fringes of El Salvador's 10-year
civil war.
   They are viewed as subversives, at best, by the military
establishment and the conservative government.
   To the extremists of the far-right, they are mortal enemies.
   ``Our only sin is opting for the poor, serving the poor, helping
poor communities,'' Lutheran Bishop Medardo Gomez said in January
upon his return to El Salvador. Gomez, whose church works
extensively with refugees and in shantytowns, left the country in
November as a huge guerrilla offensive by the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front convulsed the capital.
   Gomez, whose offices have been bombed twice during the past 18
months, received repeated death threats prior to his flight. The
rightist government of President Alfredo Cristiani deplored the
threats. But it also said it could not guarantee Gomez's safety.
   El Salvador, the size of Massachusetts with 5 million
inhabitants, is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. Protestant
denominations have established congregations in recent decades, and
some churches _ including the Lutheran, Baptist and Episcopal _
administer programs on behalf of victims of the civil war.
   The world was shocked on Nov. 16 by the massacre of six Jesuit
priests and educators _ the leadership of the prestigious Central
American University and the nucleus of El Salvador's intellectual
life. The priests' cook and her 15-year-old daughter also were
slain.
   Cristiani announced in January that government soldiers
committed the murders, perhaps the most heinous politically
motivated crime of a civil war infamous for its heinous political
crimes. He identified four officers, including a colonel, and five
soldiers as the alleged culprits. Eight of the nine were charged
with premeditated murder and jailed. One, a soldier, is a fugitive.
   ``It is claimed that what happened was that a small group of
members of the armed forces have stained the honor of the military
institution,'' Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary bishop of
San Salvador, said in a recent interview. ``We find that difficult
to accept.
   ``We do not think these are isolated cases of people who stray
from the path of an institution. Rather, we think they are the
product of a way of thinking, an education that views as subversive
the work of people like the slain Jesuits, the work of church
people committed to helping resolve the problems of the poor, work
on behalf of human rights.
   ``This education, in the final analysis, teaches that we are the
enemy,'' he said.
   The far-right considers the Jesuits to be Marxist ideologues.
Throughout the civil war, the Jesuits at Central American
University have maintained that the conflict arose from gross
social injustice and that only by addressing its causes could it be
resolved. This angered the armed forces and the elite, who
contended the revolution was the result of international communist
expansion.
   The slaying of the Jesuits was not the first murderous attack on
a voice from the church.
   A sniper killed Catholic Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero as he
said Mass on March 24, 1980, the day after he issued an impassioned
plea to army troops to disobey orders to kidnap, torture or
summarily execute suspected leftists.
   The Christian Democratic government that handed power to
Cristiani last June said it had proof that top figures in Arena,
Cristiani's party, plotted the murder. But the case became
terminally bogged down in a judiciary notorious for its
inefficiency.
   Prosecution of Romero's killers is considered highly unlikely.
   On Dec. 2, 1980, national guardsmen kidnapped and killed three
U.S. nuns and a lay woman churchworker. Five soldiers were
convicted of the murders, but officers implicated in the crime were
never prosecuted. The convicted guardsmen said they had been told
the women were involved in subversive activity.
   All four women helped people displaced by the war. Two  Dorothy Kazel
and Jean Donovan, worked with an orphanage 10
miles south of San Salvador.
   The orphanage _ the Oscar Arnulfo Romero Community _ is home to
154 boys and girls whose parents were killed inof them,
Sister the war. It
represents in microcosm the often-strained relations between the
government and armed forces, on one side, and a church that
considers its mission more than purely pastoral.
   The Rev. Ken Myers, a diocesan priest and native of Norwalk,
Ohio, founded the center in August 1980.
   The project began ``with a dozen real sick orphan children from
the refugee centers,'' he said in an interview in his office at the
orphanage, just outside the small town of ZaHayward formed a
non-profit corporation to attract new industry to the area.
   _The resort association has written letters of support at the
tribe's request for various projects.
   _The tribe has offered to stock fish in off-reservation lakes
when its new hatchery is constructed.
   _The resort association donated $200 to help defray costs to
send a delegation of Wisconsin Indians to Germany last September.
   _Teachers from public and reservation schools occasionally get
training together at each other's schools. Indian teachers have
moved from the reservation schools into public schools.
   Paul DeMaine, who owns a newspaper on the reservation, said the
two sides get along because the ``silent majority has been able to
speak up here.''
   When racism started bubbling to the surface, the ``non-Indian
community spoke up against it,'' DeMaine said.
   It wasn't always so peaceful, Toebe recalls.
   Equal Rights for Everyone, a group opposed to Indian treaty
rights, was active in the area for a short period. Its influence,
however, waned after one of its leaders received less than 20
percent of the vote in a 1986 run for the state senate in a
campaign in which treaty rights was a big issue, Toebe said.
   Gaiashkibos said confrontations over treaty rights still could
flare up in the Hayward area because the players and personalities
can change.
   Gaiashkibos plays down his role in fostering cooperation. But a
poster outside his office provides some insight into his
philosophies.
   It says: ``We shall learn these devices the white man has ... We
shall master his machinery, his inventions, his skills, his
medicine, his planning. But we will retain our beauty and still be
Indian.''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Joe Versus the Volcano'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Film opens nationwide March 9.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Today's filmmakers are astonished to learn that film classics
such as ``Citizen Kane,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``High Noon'' were
shot almost entirely on studio stages and backlots. Throughout the
1930s and '40s, a movie made on location was a rarity, as films
created a dream-like world that enthralled entertainment-starved
audiences.
   One of the many charms of the strangely titled ``Joe Versus the
Volcano'' is its other-worldliness, the result of being filmed
mostly within the confines of a studio. There are a few cityscapes,
but the ocean scenes were shot on a studio tank, and the South Sea
island is gloriously phony. You keep expecting Dorothy Lamour to
appear in a sarong.
   ``Joe Versus the Volcano'' is the first comedy hit of the 1990s.
Tom Hanks is bigger than ever. If you liked Meg Ryan in ``When
Harry Met Sally ...,'' you'll like her three times as much in this
one; she plays three roles.
   The brain behind the film is John Patrick Shanley, whose
``Moonstruck'' proved he knew how to write credible characters in
hilarious situations. This time he writes and directs, assuring
that his vision reaches the screen intact.
   The physical vision has been realized by production designer Bo
Welch, starting with the zig-zag pathway along which Hanks and his
fellow workers slouch to their abominable jobs in a pharmaceutical
supply company (``home of the rectal probe'').
   Hanks leaves his numbing job after being told by Dr. Robert
Stack that he has a fatal disease. He is enlisted by industrialist
Lloyd Bridges to travel to the South Sea island of Waponi Woo and
act as a human sacrifice to appease the raging volcano. Bridges
then hopes to gain a rare mineral for his superconductor business.
   The latter-day Jack Lemmon as portrayer of society's victim,
Hanks is perfect for the role. Along the way he meets three women:
a downtrodden fellow worker, the spaced-out daughter of Bridges and
her half-sister, who accompanies Hanks on his voyage. All are the
incredibly inventive Meg Ryan.
   ``Joe Versus the Volcano'' was produced by Teri Schwartz, with
the team of Steven Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall
as executive producers. Happily, this is one Amblin Entertainment
production that has wit as well as special effects.
   The Warner Bros. release is rated PG for minor swearing and
scariness. Running time: About two hours.

   ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (Walt Disney Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$22.99. Rated PG)
   
   How nice to see the silly and easy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''
available to the video watcher. It's a light, improbable adventure
with lots of family and human values.
   The movie stars Rick Moranis (``Ghostbusters II,'' ``Little Shop
of Horrors'') as Wayne Szalinski, a scientist whose inventions
gather laughs rather than loot. His latest is an incredible
shrinking machine. He presents it at a symposium but his colleagues
only snicker.
   Meanwhile, back at his chaotic home, his son and daughter and
the neighbors' two boys accidentally find themselves in front of
the machine, which has been activated when a baseball crashes
through the attic window. Poof! The little tykes soon become just
that _ \-inch tall.
   Dad returns in a bitter frenzy and smashes his invention. Glass
flies everywhere, and the wee ones run for their lives between the
cavernous cracks in the floorboards. Then dad decides to neaten up
a bit and sweeps the smashed machine and the kiddies into a plastic
garbage bag and takes same to the trash cans on the street.
   But this is a fearless foursome. They cut themselves free with a
sliver of glass and set out on a little adventure to return home.
Suddenly, an ordinary backyard becomes a jungle of unknown terrors.
The sprinkler system is like the Hoover Dam bursting open; a
scorpion is the same as facing down a Tyrannosaurus rex during
prehistoric times; an ant is like a wild horse that is easily tamed
and becomes a mascot; a Lego toy offers refuge; and a stale cookie
is a feast for millions.
   The predicament brings out the best in the two sets of kids, who
before being zapped pretty much hated each other: Amy (Amy O'Neill)
and Nick (Robert Oliveri) Szalinski, and Ron (Jared Rushton) and
Little Russ (Thomas Brown) Thompson.
   Nick, a young Einstein, and Russ, a rough and tumble ``real''
boy, are the more endearing of the four. Amy has little to do
except provide a love interest for the girlish-looking Ron and play
big sister to her little brother, Nick. The acting is adequate but
not exciting. Only Brown and Oliveri provide a spark.
   As the father, Moranis is his usual nerdy but lovable self, and
his tenacity is rewarded. Marcia Strassman as his wife, Diane, is
an afterthought. The neighbors are Matt Frewer and Kristine
Sutherland.
   Bad neighbors become good friends in the end; bullies learn
humility; loners become team players; and callous children learn
the value of family and friendship.
   The special effects are fun, and the miniatures crew did an
excellent job with models and sets.
   Buy this one, your kids will love it, and so will you.

   ``Field of Dreams'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta. Rated PG. Priced
for rental market only).
   
   One of the strangest nominees this year in the Academy Awards
race for best picture is ``Field of Dreams.'' Strange because
other, finer movies were not nominated, such as ``Glory.''
   A melange of mysticism, nostalgia and the kind of pap, smarmy
philosophy you find on greeting cards, the Phil Alden Robinson
movie seemed to have a strong identity crisis.
   No matter. Its box-office success obviously meant a lot of
people out there loved it.
   ``Field of Dreams'' stars Kevin Costner as an ah-shucks American
type who builds a baseball field after hearing a ``voice.'' He
manages to resurrect the ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson (my, how
that guy got around movieland last year) and other dead baseball
types.
   If you're still watching this video at this point, then press on
and good luck.
   As for those of you who like real classy schmaltz, run back to
the video store and rent ``Bambi.''

   ``Rigoletto,'' opera in three acts by Giuseppe Verdi, a two CD
album (London) _ Riccardo Chailly, conductor
   
   This recording of what many consider Verdi's ``breakthrough''
opera _ from his youthful period into a more mature style _ has a
bright sound, a thoughtful conductor (Riccardo Chailly) and about
the best cast that could be assembled today.
   By coincidence, the three principals are the same singers who
have just completed a series of ``Rigolettos'' in a new production
at the Metropolitan Opera House.
   Luciano Pavarotti is in fine form as the womanizing, scoundrelly
Duke, a role he has been singing better than anyone else for two
decades. Ill-advised ventures into heavier parts have robbed him of
some of the unforced freshness he had in his youth, but Pavarotti
is still a model of stylishness and opulent sound. He even musters
a high E-flat for the climax of his Act 2 cabaletta, ``Possenti
amor mi chiama.''
   As Gilda, the betrayed maiden who sacrifices her life for this
cad, soprano June Anderson shows why she has generated such
excitement in the operatic world of late. She displays dazzling
purity of tone all the way up to high E, but more impressively, she
has a full-size, dramatic voice, not the pipsqueak coloratura one
often hears in this part. Comparisons with Joan Sutherland may be
premature, but one is eager to hear more.
   In the title role, baritone Leo Nucci sounds better than he did
in live performance, probably because the studio recording helps
amplify a voice of only medium strength. His interpretation is
always interesting and often moving; he seems to be living the
character, not just singing the notes.
   As a bonus, two relatively minor parts are cast with unusual
strength. Bass Nicolai Ghiaurov sounds appropriately sepulchral as
the hired assassin Sparafucile, and mezzo Shirley Verrett brings
her usual regal presence to the part of his sister, the sultry
Maddalena. Just to make it clear Miss Verrett is no supporting
player, the album carries a special note stating that she ``agreed
to make a cameo appearance as a special favor to Mr. Pavarotti.''
   Chailly conducts the orchestra and chorus of the Teatro Comunale
di Bologna.

   ``Music Man'' (RCA) _ Bobby Ross Avila
   
   On first glance, Bobby Ross Avila might seem an escapee from
Menudo.
   This 13-year-old, however, displays more talent on his debut
album, ``Music Man,'' than those Latin teenyboppers.
   But what's going on here? He IS only 13, another babe in
musicland. He makes Debbie Gibson and New Kids on the Block look,
well, adult. At least he's got some years on Old Skull, whose three
members are around age 10.
   So has MTV caused a rash of adolescent fame-seekers? Is Avila,
who goes by ``Ross,'' going to give the kids of America an
inferiority complex because they, too, haven't put out an album by
their teen-age years?
   Well, maybe not. Avila's a different case. He got into the music
biz through his father, Bobby Avila Sr., a veteran of Top 40 and
rhythm and blues bands.
   Unlike New Kids and Tiffany, Avila writes his own music, plays
keyboards and programs drum synthesizers.
   His album is an upbeat collection of dance tracks, freshened
with some hip-hopping beats and some rapping. None of the songs
break any new musical ground, but they won't break any sensitive
ears either.
   Avila's voice sounds something like the young Michael Jackson.
It also sounds like a 13-year-old's.
   He is a kid to win the hearts of not only young girls but also
their mothers. He makes several references to God in his liner
notes and lyrics, giving thanks for his musical ability, and also
does an anti-drug song, ``Drugs Ain't My Thang.''
   Avila, who co-wrote the songs with his father and James Felix,
also offers a few ballads. They're pretty sappy _ about what one
might expect from a 13-year-old.

   So what's so unusual about a German director
and a German star making a film in Stuttgart? Well, it happens to
be Stuttgart, Ark.
   The movie is ``Rosalie Goes Shopping,'' another collaboration of
the idiosyncratic filmmaker Percy Adlon and his favorite actress,
Marianne Saegebrecht. She recently was in Los Angeles to talk about
how the film came about.
   ``Percy was making a trip from the East Coast to the West Coast
and he came upon a place called Stuttgart, Arkansas. He found this
very precious little city with its interesting buildings and
factory, and he saw this plane circling around. He found the
airport and he talked to the pilot and to his wife,'' she said.
   ``That was the beginning of the story. Having made a lot of
documentaries, he likes to use real people and real places.''
   Adlon and co-writer Christopher Doherty devised a fanciful tale
of an Arkansas cropduster (Brad Davis), his German wife and their
large brood. To keep her family in luxuries, the wife plays her
credit cards with the skill of a Las Vegas blackjack dealer. She
breaks all the monetary laws, plus the criminal code, but amasses
enough credit for a leveraged buyout.
   ``When Percy came to me with the script first, I was shocked,''
Saegebrecht said. ``I couldn't imagine playing this strong woman
with a big ego, and she's stealing and doing this and that. I said,
`No, this is not for me!'
   ``Percy said: `I wrote it for you; you are in my mind. Because I
discovered there is another part of you.' I said no; he said,
`Think about it.'
   ``I was still against it. I don't have to lie, I don't have to
steal, I don't have the bad mother-relationship that she has. But
then I went into her background of why she wanted to get as far
away from home as possible. Also, when I went to Arkansas, I
understood her much better.''
   Adlon often gets his way with the actress, though not always.
Theirs is a symbiotic relationship that resulted in ``Sugarbaby''
in 1984 and ``Bagdad Cafe'' in 1987. The director has remarked:
``There is no facet of Marianne's face which is not alluring when
caught by the camera. ... And she doesn't even realize it.''
   Indeed, Saegebrecht seems ingenuous about her success, though
she retains the confidence of an experienced actress. She is stout
but moves like a petite woman. Her English comes in spurts, with
occasional transpositions of German rhetoric.
   ``Rosalie Goes Shopping'' continues her education in things
American. It began with visits to New York, Pennsylvania and Los
Angeles, then moved to the southwestern desert for the filming of
``Bagdad Cafe.'' Arkansas was a revelation.
   ``The Middle West _ my God, what a difference!'' she exclaimed.
``There is a village and then it is very far to the next village.
The restaurants are closing at 9. It's not allowed to drink
alcohol. It is allowed to buy it, then they hide it in a bag. All
these things are completely different.
   ``And it's a man's, man's, man's world. They all have guns. Not
only one gun. Two guns, three guns. When you go on the highway, all
the cars coming by, there's a gun in the window. They like to hunt.
We were there during squirrel hunting. Later it's duck hunting time.
   ``But also I met beautiful people. I walked around; they were
shocked that I would. They were very communicative and helpful.''
   Saegebrecht was born in Starnberg, Bavaria, in 1945, and started
in show business by managing a cabaret revue with her then-husband.
In 1977, she concocted something she called ``Opera Curiosa,'' a
touring revue with a cast including ballet dancers, strip teasers,
clowns, musclemen, street singers and opera performers.
   Adlon cast her first in a television drama, followed with a
feature film, ``The Swing.'' Her appearances in his films have
caught the attention of American filmmakers. Paul Mazursky cast her
in ``Moon Over Parador,'' and Danny DeVito gave her a role with
himself, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas in ``The War of the
Roses.''
   More Hollywood movies?
   ``Maybe so,'' she said. ``But my home will always be in Munich.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Art Treasures Bring Museums Revenue in Unexpected
Ways</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   When Georges Seurat painted his famous work
``Sunday Afternoon on the Island of Grande Jatte'' in the 19th
century, he could never have dreamed his depiction of a tranquil
day in a park would someday be used to sell computer software.
   Nor could Claude Monet imagine his paintings of water lilies
would be turned into posters adorning art students' dormitory walls.
   While art for art's sake is certainly big business _ U.S.
auction houses sold more than $1.5 billion worth of art last year,
chalking up their best-selling season ever _ art used for
postcards, calendars, posters and advertising is becoming an
increasingly important source of revenue for financially strapped
museums.
   And since museums often must hold legal rights on a work to turn
it into saleable merchandise, museums are becoming more willing to
fight for copyrights and licensing privileges on the art they
exhibit.
   Boston's Museum of Fine Arts is locked in such a dispute with
the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona in
Tuscon. The museum earned the center's ire when it printed a series
of posters of Edward Weston photographs to accompany an exhibit of
his work.
   The center says it holds the copyright to reproduce all Weston
photographs and says the museum reproduced them without permission.
But the museum says the center is trying to place unnecessary
constraints on the pictures and is suing the center to have the
copyright declared invalid.
   ``If someone has a valid copyright and doesn't want us to use a
work, we'll usually just drop it,'' said Carl Zahn, director of
publications at the Museum of Fine Arts. ``But in this case we felt
like we were being constrained from having this exhibit.''
   The suit is pending, and in the meantime a U.S. district judge
has ordered that the show continue. The posters can be printed,
using a limited number of Weston images, with a disclaimer that
reads: ``The Arizona Board of Regents claims a copyright on these
photographs of Edward Weston. The Museum of Fine Arts contests the
validity of that claim.''
   Center director Terrence Pitts said the museum's right to hold
the exhibit was never contested. But he said the center wanted to
ensure the photos weren't used improperly.
   ``We want to make sure these photos don't fall into the public
domain where they can be used for commercial purposes,'' Pitts
said. ``Commercialism isn't in the spirit of Weston's photographs.''
   But commercialism is exactly what Elizabeth Burke has in mind
for many of the artworks housed in the Art Institute of Chicago.
   Burke, coordinator of reproductions and marketing for the
museum, oversees which artistic images the museum licenses for use
in advertisements.
   Once advertisers came to museums, cap in hand, seeking the right
to use masterpieces for advertisements. Now Burke has turned the
tables and is marketing the institute's works to advertising and
publicity types.
   ``It's a lot like a stock photography service,'' Burke said.
``Advertising people don't know the resource they have in museums.''
   Burke charges a flat fee for the use of images, say, $750 for
the cover of a book. Last year, such charges brought the museum
$85,000, more than double the amount made just a few years ago.
   But not all requests are granted. Burke recalls the German
company that wanted to use Edward Hopper's ``Nighthawks'' to
advertise their fax machines.
   ``They just wanted to use a blurry image from the painting,''
Burke said. ``I felt that it was such a small part of the painting
that it wasn't worth it. I wanted Hopper to rest in peace.''
   Another request came from a fitness magazine that wanted to put
``American Gothic,'' Grant Wood's famous painting of an American
farming couple, on its cover.
   ``They want to put a jogging suit on the woman, and make her
sort of voluptuous. They want to give the man a golf club, and have
him look sporty,'' Burke said. ``We're not sure about that one.''
   Pat Musolf, director of marketing for the International Museum
of Photography at the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., said
copyright disputes involving photographs seem to be coming up more
and more.
   ``A lot of people are claiming rights to licensing, even if they
don't really have those rights,'' she said.
   Musolf said her museum recently got into a spat with the estate
of Fred Astaire for distributing an Edward Steichen photograph of
Astaire without first paying a reproduction fee.
   ``It hadn't even occurred to us we'd have to pay,'' she said.
``It puts me on edge.''
   Distributors often end up paying such fees to copyright holders
even if they're not sure the claim is valid, since it's cheaper
than taking the case to court, Musolf said.
   ``It's almost a way of intimidating someone into paying a fee,''
she said. ``And the copyright laws are very hard to understand,
very confusing. Even the lawyers don't know half the time who
really has the rights.''
   But Burke said reproductions are often made without obtaining
licensing rights, with unsightly results.
   ``We had a postcard company use one of our Renoirs recently
without permission,'' Burke said. ``It turned out looking purple,
and there's no purple in the painting. It's hideous.''
   Burke said museums are bound to hold more tightly to their
licensing rights.
   ``Museums aren't as rich as they once were, and this is a source
of revenue for us,'' she said. ``So we're going to put out our
necks to get them to stop using those images without getting the
rights.''

   When the Roches _ sisters Maggie, Terre and
Suzzy _ sing harmony, their voices don't just join, they overlap,
like hands clasped in support.
   Their records sound as spontaneous as sing-alongs in the
backseat of the car, as intimate as late-night talks around the
kitchen table.
   But doubts haunt these family heart-to-hearts. On their seventh
album, ``Speak,'' question marks hang over declarations of love.
Disappointments are grudgingly accepted as facts of life. Humor
becomes a final defense against despair.
   ``I think one of the reasons we've been able to keep a real
intense sort of creative integrity going, if I may be so bold, is
because we have the support of each other,'' Terre said of herself
and her two sisters in a recent interview.
   ``If I were one person dealing with business people and record
people, who are constantly giving feedback, I wouldn't have been
able to make it. We're constantly checking in, checking the pulse
of what were doing, what we want to say.''
   Music brings the good news. On ``Feeling Is Mutual,'' the pace
is relaxed, easy, the percussion gently keeping time. The singing
is assured, even relieved, the sound of three wise women gratified
to still be together.
   ``When you're listening to this record, you're listening to
people who have been basically singing together at least 20 years,
which is a very seasoned blending of voices,'' Suzzy said. ``I
think it would be hard to arrive at that without time.''
   The Roches grew up in Park Ridge, N.J., winning local talent
shows and attracting enough attention for Maggie and Terre to tour
folk clubs around the country, younger sister Suzzy at first
staying behind.
   Avowed fans of Paul Simon, upon learning that he had expressed
interest in their singing backup on his 1973 album, ``There Goes
Rhymin' Simon,'' the Roches decided to accept his offer _ without
bothering to tell him.
   ``We kind of crashed the session,'' Terre recalled. ``We had
three days off because a gig had been canceled, so we took the bus
from Pittsburgh down to Muscle Shoals, Ala., and we just showed up
at his studio and said, `We heard that you wanted us to sing.'''
   ``There was a moment when we first arrived,'' Maggie added,
``and they all had gone out to lunch. The person didn't know who we
were and we said we're looking for Paul Simon and he sort of went
into this `get away from here' mode.''
   Only Maggie and Terre appeared on their debut album, ``Seductive
Reasoning,'' in 1975, but Suzzy permanently joined them for the
acclaimed ``The Roches,'' released four years later.
   ``I gotta dance to keep from crying,'' Smokey Robinson once
sang, and the Roches seemed to understand, camping their way
through lost love, menial jobs and anxiety about health food. The
sound was all natural, featuring acoustic guitars and proudly
undubbed vocals.
   A decade later, the production is more polished and the only
out-and-out laughs come on ``The Anti-Sex Backlash of the '80's,''
Suzzy's selected transcript of a conversation between her sisters.
Otherwise, the mood is more reflective, sentimental, as the Roches
sing of ``listening to rain falling in the darkness'' and proudly
declare, ``I love my mom.''
   ``I think people who tend to see what we're doing as being
humorous, it always strikes me that they're not looking at it
closely enough,'' Terre said.
   ``A lot of situations you run into, the very edge of sadness or
trouble, usually sort of turns into something that's almost a
grotesque kind of humor. Sometimes you see a terrible accident, but
you're inclined to laugh.''
   ``Big Nuthin''' recalls the early years, when the Roches seemed
just a song or concert away from commercial success. Terre compared
it to the poem in which a man sees a ball of gold in the sky and
reaches for it. When the prize is finally in his hands, he
discovers the ball of gold is merely a rock.
   They learned to stop reaching in 1985 after parting ways with
Warner Bros. Minus outside pressure, the Roches _ now signed with
MCA _ finally relaxed, handling day-to-day struggles with a
resigned shrug of the shoulders.
   ``In a very practical sense, when we separated from Warner
Bros., the whole question of can we make a living without the big
machinary was such a struggle,'' Suzzy said.
   ``Even though we have the creative freedom, it's a struggle
constantly, and I think we did a lot of soul searching during that
time and really came out much better for it.
   ``We sort of turned our back on the whole record thing,'' Terre
recalled. ``We said, `We're just going to write songs and perform
on the road,' and then all of a sudden a record deal came along.
Like when you're not trying to fall in love with somebody, you fall
in love.''

   Ann Beattie loves children's drawings. She finds
them wonderful, even radical, and regrets that those qualities are
usually lost in the art rooms of local schools.
   Her own work is a careful balance between the untutored joy of a
nursery schooler's fingerpainting and the polished craft of a
professional portrait. It's a two-step process, the author says:
writing and editing; the secrets and surprises of first putting the
words on paper and the often chilly task of elimination and
alteration that follows.
   ``Picturing Will'' (Random House, $18.95), her first novel in
four years, is the final product of a frustrating juggling act that
saw 15 chapters and several working titles lie crumpled in a nearby
wastebasket, the result of a creative process with several
unexpected, agonizing plot twists.
   ``Unless you intuit correctly, whether as an adult or a child,
you've just got to revise it and fix it to make it a work of art,''
explained Beattie, 43, whose work includes the novels ``Chilly
Scenes of Winter'' and ``Falling in Place'' and the short-story
collections ``The Burning House'' and ``Where You'll Find Me.''
   ``I did intuit a lot of things that I gave the wrong form for.
For instance, there were fairy tales in the first or second or
third version of this book and they were totally inappropriate.
They were good writing, so what? There was no reason for them to be
there.''
   The novel reads like an album of deep-focus photography, with
matters small and large in sharp detail. A pair of red trunks seems
as bright as the afternoon sun. The breakup of a marraige is no
clearer than the curve of a man's fingers.
   Time is accelerated and stretched out, the narrative a montage
of jump cuts and lengthy flashbacks. Years are compressed into
paragraphs while Beattie dwells on moments for several pages.
   ``What is time?'' Beattie wonders in ``Picturing Will.''
   ``As the child experiences it, it makes no sense at all.
Children have little or no sense of what goes on behind the scenes,
so when things happen, they seem just to happen suddenly ...
   ``Considered from the child's perspective, life is always
speeding up or going too slowly. The best ideas come at bedtime.
The circus ends too soon. String beans take forever to eat.''
   Like much of her fiction, the plot is secondary as Beattie
probes the lives of a group of adults and the 5{-year-old boy,
Will, who brings them together.
   ``Picturing Will'' is divided into three sections: ``Mother,''
``Father'' and ``Child,'' with passages from a diary woven
throughout. Jody is a photographer and, like Beattie, a resident of
Charlottesville, Va. Wayne, her ex-husband, now lives in Florida,
and Mel, her boyfriend, works in a New York art gallery.
   ``When I caught on to what was going on, it was happening on so
many different levels that to realize the implication of all of
them was extremely difficult. The temptation was alweys to go for
good writing, not to go for something more haunting,'' Beattie said.
   Facts are not so much revealed as overheard, like a child with
his ear pressed against the kitchen door. Characters are seen up
close and at a distance, lost in their own thoughts and found in
the thoughts of others.
   ``One of the working titles of the book was `Triptych.' I was
thinking about it the way a painter would think, three parts all
reflecting one another simultaneously,'' Beattie said.
   ``A painting has an advantage: You can look at it. In the novel
you have to read 230 pages to figure out what's going on. It is the
sort of book that makes you understand only in retrospect, where a
painting can make you understand instantly.''
   Beattie, who grew up in Washington, studied English literature
at American University and 18th century literature in the graduate
program of the University of Connecticut.
   Her work appeared in the New Yorker in 1974, and two years later
``Chilly Scenes of Winter'' and the short-story collection
``Distortions'' were published simultaneously.
   The first 50 pages of ``Chilly Scenes'' were thrown out and what
remained seemed disjointed, a muted symphony of unfinished thoughts
and awkward silences. Beattie's characters, survivors of the 1960s
counterculture, drifted through a series of anti-climaxes.
   A father's death is confused with memories of the day's
groceries. The reconciliation of the book's young couple is
followed by a crazy woman's study of snowflakes.
   ``It would seem to me to be unfortunately self-absorbed to
suggest in fiction something that isn't true in life, which is when
things reach a crescendo, that is indeed neatly where things end,''
Beattie said.
   ``I can't think of any event in my life or any event that I have
observed where I've had the curtain drop at the moment when the
significant line is uttered.''
   She rejects the term ``minimalist'' for her terse sentences and
semi-articulate characters. It's an invention of the media, she
says, and not reflective of her more recent work, like the 1985
novel ``Love Always,'' Beattie's most humorous book.
   ``All artists are involved in personal quests, regardless of how
well they seem to be investigating larger matters,'' Beattie
writes. ``Picturing Will'' is an open book, the author insists, and
many of the third-person observations are really her own.
   ``There are value judgments all over the place,'' she said.
``The process of selection, the process of organization. It's not
what's off the page, between the lines and so forth, it's what is
on the page. With this book, it would be extremely difficult not to
know where I stand.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Success Has Not Spoiled Randy Travis</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Randy Travis might be a country music
superstar, but he hasn't forgotten those lean, hard days when he
made a living washing dishes and cooking catfish.
   He has won more than 40 awards for his singing, has sold 10
million records and made such songs as ``Forever and Ever, Amen''
and ``It's Just a Matter of Time'' into hits.
   So far in his short career, the 30-year-old Travis has made
three international concert tours, performed on just about every
network TV show that features live music and performed twice for
President Bush.
   There have been changes in his life with success, but he's still
the same soft-spoken Randy Travis.
   ``It hasn't changed me as a person,'' he said in an interview.
``It's changed my lifestyle. I live out of a suitcase on the road.
But I still enjoy doing the same things I always have. I still
enjoy the same people and the same music.''
   However, he no longer has to work as a $200-a-week cook and
dishwasher.
   About four years ago, if the dishes weren't piling up and the
food orders were filled, Travis would step out of the kitchen and
onto the Nashville Palace's cramped stage and sing for three dozen
or so people.
   ``It crosses my mind quite often,'' he said of those days and
nights at the grill. ``I still have friends there. I had good times
there. I didn't mind washing the dishes or cooking or whatever
needed to be done.
   ``I would go in and clean the place up a lot of days before the
business opened. I didn't mind it.''
   Travis, a native of Marshville, N.C., began singing country
music and playing guitar at age 8. He moved to Charlotte, N.C., at
age 16 and performed in nightclubs for five years.
   He moved to Nashville in 1981 and was signed by Warner Bros.
four years later after a Warner's executive heard him sing at the
Nashville Palace restaurant-nightclub.
   His most recent album, ``No Holdin' Back,'' has sold 1 million
copies. His LP ``Always and Forever'' is at the 3 million mark,
``Storms of Life'' is at 2 million and ``Old 8 x 10'' chips is in
with another 1 million. Sales of singles push the total past 10
million.
   ``It's an amazing thought,'' he said. ``I didn't expect to have
that kind of success. I've been very shocked.''
   His top single record was ``Forever and Ever, Amen,'' which
appears destined to become a country classic.
   ``It said something to everybody,'' Travis said. ``The song said
things people could relate to. It's been used at a lot of
weddings.''
   His other hits include ``Deeper Than the Holler,'' ``On the
Other Hand,'' ``It's Just a Matter of Time,'' ``Promises,'' ``Is It
Still Over,'' ``Honky Tonk Moon'' and ``I Won't Need You Anymore.''
   Travis believes he's been successful because the public was
ready for his style of hard-core country music with his deep voice
and acoustic instruments. His song lyrics focus on such themes as
romance and personal relationships.
   ``The (country music) business had been the same people for a
lot of years,'' he said. ``I think the music got boring. For some
reason, the record companies weren't signing new acts, but then
they went back to basic music.
   ``Then I was in the right place at the right time. It's funny,
because I got turned down for several years by every label in town.
There wasn't a place to put what I was doing. I had to wait on my
turn, I guess.''
   He performed at President Bush's Inaugural Gala a year ago, and
performed early this year at a celebration marking Bush's first
year in office.
   ``It's a very scary feeling,'' Travis recalled about
entertaining the president. ``It's different than any other crowd.
You don't normally go to our shows and look out at tuxedos and
evening gowns.
   ``I got to go inside the White House this most recent trip and
he (Bush) was joking around. He said he wished he had time to go
play some Randy Travis CDs. It made me feel good. It was a great
honor.''

   Small, independent theaters are standing
up to big cinema chains for first-run movies in Ohio.
   Rep. Joan Lawrence has proposed a bill on behalf of independent
theater owners that would require distributors to consider written
bids from all theaters on first-run films, prohibiting a current
practice of bidding by telephone, which she says eliminates
competition.
   She said motion picture distributors give the chains first
option on first runs until after most moviegoers have seen them,
and cited the current hit, ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' as an
example.

the sophisticated computer program trading strategies they brought
to the Tokyo market for the recent volatility in stock prices.
   Though unnerved by recent wild swings on the Tokyo exchange,
traders concede that they must familiarize themselves with such
techniques, which involve moving huge blocks of stocks with the
flick of a computer key.
   Last week, the Tokyo market suffered two of its five worst daily

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said it paid 1989
bonuses of $196 million in cash and $64 million in company stock,
less than reports that pointed to large payments prior to the
firm's collapse.
   On Friday, Drexel released details about the payments after
harsh reaction from bankruptcy court creditors, who criticized the
firm for reportedly paying up to $350 million in bonuses shortly
before its parent filed for Chapter 11 protection.
   Drexel said 44 percent, or $113 million, of the total bonuses
was guaranteed to executives and top professionals early in 1989 in
an effort to keep them at the firm after it agreed to plead guilty
to securities crimes and pay $650 million in penalties.

   Forbes magazine is the cornerstone of a Forbes
family empire that ranges from publishing to collections of Faberge
eggs, a Moroccan palace, a South Pacific island and acres of
Colorado ranchland.
   Malcolm S. Forbes made it all work in tandem through force of
personality.
   Publishing executives and analysts said Forbes magazine lost its
its best salesman this past weekend with the death of its chairman
and editor in chief.
   Forbes' sojourns by motorcycle and hot air balloon through
exotic locales and his lavish parties attended by heads of state,
celebrities and corporate bosses undoubtedly helped create
excitement about his flagship magazine.
   ``I'm sure that trickled down to advertising orders,'' said
magazine publishing consultant Martin Walker.
   Media analyst John Reidy agreed that Forbes' style ``helped in a
major way to bring in advertisers _ there was probably nobody quite
like that before.''
   But the analysts said Forbes also left behind a strong
organization in which he gave increasing responsibility to his
designated successor, his oldest son Malcolm Forbes Jr., known as
Steve, and that the company should thrive.
   Malcolm Jr., who has won four awards for economic forecasting
from USX Corp., announced Sunday he would take over as chairman and
chief executive of the magazine and the family-owned company and as
editor in chief of Forbes.
   Three other Forbes' sons also have roles with the company.
   ``While the death of Malcolm Forbes is a loss to journalism and
certainly to the company he did so much to build, one can fully
anticipate that that his company will continue to do very well,''
said Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune, a key competitor to
Forbes magazine.
   Forbes magazine was started two years before Malcolm Forbes was
born.
   His father, Scottish immigrant Bertie Charles Forbes, was a
syndicated financial journalist for a New York newspaper and
launched Forbes in 1917.
   Malcolm Forbes, born Aug. 19, 1919, became associate publisher
of the magazine in 1947. When B.C. Forbes died, he was succeeded by
his oldest son, Bruce, and Malcolm moved up to the posts of editor
and publisher.
   Bruce died in 1964, and Malcolm took the top jobs. The magazine
had about 800 ad pages a year and a circulation of 100,000. At his
death, ad pages were over 3,900 and circulation exceeded 735,000.
   Forbes made his father's magazine unique among the business
magazines by providing ``a more personalized view of business''
than Fortune and Business Week did, according to the magazine
analyst Walker.
   The magazine focused more on the strategies of individual
entrepreneurs and corporate leaders rather than day-to-day business
news. Its big annual list was not of the top companies, like the
Fortune 500, but the wealthiest 400 American individuals and
families.
   ``He forced the others to address business in a more human and
personal way,'' Walker said. Fortune's Loeb said, ``He shook us all
up.''
   Last year, the biweekly Forbes' ad pages were slightly ahead of
the biweekly Fortune at 3,775 pages but behind the weekly Business
Week at 4,914 pages, according to Publishers Information Bureau
figures for 1989.
   Walker said Forbes' circulation trails both Fortune and Business
Week, which he said were at 783,000 and 901,000, respectively.
   A few years after taking over the business, Forbes decided to
diversify into other areas. He purchased ranch land in Colorado and
land by lakes in Missouri, parts of which have been made available
for sale.
   The company acquired Laucala, one of the Fiji Islands in the
South Pacific, where executives can go on retreats. In keeping with
his wishes, Forbes' body will be cremated and the ashes buried on
the island.
   Forbes invited dozens of bigwigs to his palace in Tangier,
Morocco, last year for his 70th birthday party. Visitors to the
Forbes building in New York can see a collection of jeweled
Farberge eggs that were made in czarist Russia.
   Forbes owns the Old Battersea House on the River Thames in
London, which he used only last week for an international bridge
tournament featuring some top corporate chiefs. He was stricken
only hours after his return from London early Saturday.
   His fortune has been estimated at between $400 million and $1.2
billion.
   All of these holdings helped Forbes cultivate contacts with
corporate executives, which he hoped made them more disposed to buy
advertising with his magazine. Indeed, he initially suggested he
might be able to write off the $2 million cost of his Moroccan
birthday bash as a business expense.
   Forbes also expanded his publishing holdings. The Forbes company
owns American Heritage magazine, a monthly that specializes in
stories about important historical events. Only a week ago, Forbes
launched Egg, a magazine exploring the latest in fashion and food
in New York and Los Angeles.
   Forbes also owns 12 weekly newspapers and two shopping guides in
central New Jersey, where the Forbes estate is located. It owns an
investment advisory institute that publishes a newsletter and
offers educational programs.

   Why is Mickey Mouse so short? Why doesn't
Disney hire kids to help develop projects? Isn't Chairman Michael
Eisner offended by Bette Midler's foul mouth?
   Of every five Disney stockholders, four own fewer than 100
shares. About half have 10 or fewer. Many own a single share, and
proudly possess certificates bearing the likeness of the world's
most famous rodent to prove it.
   And as they did this past week, thousand upon thousands throng
to the Disney shareholders' meeting each year with attitudes so
protective, they might be worrying over a favorite restaurant
changing its menu rather than an entertainment colossus that turned
a $703 million profit last year.
   A young boy timidly addressed the question about Mickey's
stature to Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and President Frank Wells
at Tuesday's annual meeting, held in the cavernous Anaheim
Convention across from Disneyland.
   Eisner cupped his ear, then glanced at Wells as the boy repeated
his question into a microphone.
   ``He says, `Why is Mickey Mouse so short?''' Wells said, peering
across the huge podium at Eisner as 9,000 shareholders looked on.
   Eisner shrugged and smiled. ``Well, he's a mouse!''
   Why don't kids help develop projects? Wells doesn't miss studio attraction
in California like
the one Disney has opened to crushing crowds in Florida (forget it
_ but check out Hollywoodland, coming to you at Disneyland in 1996).
   The vast majority of Disney shares, of course, are held by
bigtime private and institutional investors, most notably Texas'
Bass brothers, concerned with the bottom line that Wells and Eisner
have nurtured so well since they were brought in to run the company
in 1984. (The share price is about eight times higher than then,
after adjusting for stock splits).
   But meeting-goers are more likely to worry whether the company,
in its quest to conquer the worlds of entertainment and leisure,
has betrayed the G-rated, young-at-heart, Magic Kingdom legacy left
by affable old Uncle Walt.
   Particularly worrisome to many shareholders were four-letter
words in movies from Disney's Touchstone studio, with Miss Midler,
who has a multipicture deal with the studio, singled out by name
repeatedly.
   There were many other concerns: if the upcoming ``Dick Tracy''
with Warren Beatty and Madonna would be a bloodfest (it's less
violent than you'd believe from the trailer, Eisner said); if
painting crews visible during day hours at theme parks might cost
Disney its ``razor's edge'' at the parks; if Disney is ruining
morale by underpaying workers.
   Eisner and Wells dodged the bombs with aplomb, for the most
part, and with a lot of help from mega-screen video appearances by
Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy (Disney bought Muppets rights last
year), and naturally Mickey himself.
   Free passes to Disneyland didn't hurt, of course.
   And, thank Mary Poppins, no one brought up that nasty PR mess
about the officer on the Queen Mary refusing to shave his mustache
to conform to Disney's tight-ship dictums (Disney bought the Queen
Mary along with the Spruce Goose and the Disneyland Hotel from the
Wrather Corp.).
   But Eisner and Wells will need all the pixie dust they can get
in the future. Just wait till word filters down that the head of
Disney's start-up record label, Hollywood Records, is the attorney
for _ hide your ears, Minnie _ Guns 'N Roses, the current
foul-mouthed champions of bad-boy rock.

   Malcolm Forbes, the self-proclaimed ``capitalist
tool'' of business publishing who used the world as a stage for his
lavish parties and ballooning exploits, was mourned as one who
reveled in life and free enterprise.
   ``Death happens to everyone but we never believed it would
happen to him; he always defied the odds,'' son Malcolm ``Steve''
Jr., who will succeed his father as head of the publishing empire,
said Sunday.
   ``What he wanted inscribed on his tombstone says it all: `While
alive, he lived.'''
   Forbes died of a heart attack while sleeping Saturday at his
40-acre estate in Far Hills, N.J. He was 70.
   ``I feel like a great light has been turned off,'' said
Elizabeth Taylor, a frequent companion of Forbes. ``He was one of
the best friends I ever had.''
   ``I don't know anyone who enjoyed life so much or gave so much
back,'' said Barbara Walters, who partied with billionaire
developer Donald Trump, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and some 1,000 other guests at
Forbes' $2 million, 70th birthday bash last fall in Tangier,
Morocco.
   Various estimates placed the worth of Forbes, chairman and chief
shareholder of Forbes Inc., at anywhere from $400 million to $1
billion.
   Whatever the amount, Forbes gleefully relished his riches.
   He made the first free flight over Beijing in a hot-air balloon
and set six world ballooning records. He owned 68 motorcycles and
made the first motorcycle tour of China. He globe-trotted with
movie stars and heads of state aboard his gold-fixtured,
helicopter-equipped yacht, the Highlander.
   But he also was gracious to everyday folks like Libby Rook, a
management consultant from Vienna, Va., who marked her 44th
birthday aboard the Highlander in 1987 after writing to Forbes on a
dare from co-workers.
   ``It's not how much money you have but what you do with it,''
Forbes once told the Star-Ledger in Newark. ``The joy of living is
incredible. We work hard at the things we have to do, so why not
take time to enjoy the things we want to do?''
   Forbes was a tireless collector, accumulating toy soldiers by
the battalion and buying up a dozen Faberge eggs, the hand-crafted
artworks of Imperial Russia.
   He was an enthusiastic champion of free enterprise and
emblazoned his corporate slogan, ``Capitalist Tool,'' on his
helicopters, balloons, even his clothing and luggage.
   ``He was a real free spirit,'' said opera star Beverly Sills,
who sang ``Happy Birthday'' at the Moroccan party. ``He had such a
joy of life. I think he would have had it if he had been a poor
man.''
   ``Malcolm Forbes was someone who lived life to its fullest and
in doing so made all of our lives a little more colorful,'' said
Iacocca.
   ``He was the quintessential American _ optimistic, buoyant and
lots of fun,'' said Kissinger.
   Forbes was born in Englewood, N.J., on Aug. 19, 1919, two years
after his father, Scottish emigrant Bertie Charles Forbes, founded
Forbes magazine.
   He graduated from Princeton in 1941, then published two weekly
newspapers in Ohio for a year. He enlisted in the Army in 1942, was
wounded in combat and received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
   Forbes won a seat on the Borough Council in Bernardsville, N.J.
in 1949. He served in the state Senate from 1951 to 1957 and ran
for governor of New Jersey in 1957, losing to Robert B. Meyner.
   After his father's death in 1954, he became publisher and editor
in chief of Forbes. The biweekly magazine, which offered a more
personalized account of business news than its competitors, rode
the 1980s bull market and the pro-business Reagan era to the
greatest success since its founding.
   Experts valued the company's flagship magazine as high as $600
million, while its American Heritage magazine, suburban newspaper,
real estate and art holdings almost add $100 million or more.
   ``He was a hell of a competitor and a promotional genius,'' said
Stephen Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week magazine.
   ``He was a worthy competitor, certainly _ tough, charming, very,
very effective,'' said Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune.
   ``He was unique and larger than life as a journalist,
entrepreneur and human being,'' said Warren H. Phillips, chairman
and chief executive of Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes The Wall
Street Journal.
   Malcolm Forbes Jr. will succeed his father as chairman and chief
executive of Forbes, Inc., and editor in chief of Forbes magazine.
He formerly was president and chief operating officer of Forbes,
Inc., and deputy editor in chief.
   ``Father _ Pop _ always looked to the future,'' said Malcolm Jr.
``He wanted this to remain a family business and it shall. As he
wished, and as the family wishes, I will succeed him as chief
executive. We will continue to move ahead as he was doing.''
   The younger Forbes said his father's body would be cremated and
the ashes buried at the Forbes-owned Pacific island of Lucala in
Fiji, in line with his wishes.
   The immediate family will hold a private service today at an
undisclosed location in New Jersey. A public memorial service was
scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at St. Bartholomew's Church in
Manhattan.
   In addition to his former wife, Roberta Laidlaw, and Malcolm
Jr., survivors include sons Robert, Christopher and Timothy, a
daughter, Moira Mumma, a brother, Wallace and eight grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   Malcolm Forbes had strong opinions on most
matters of policy and style, and the perfect vehicle to flaunt them.
   His wit and breezy writing style were displayed in the Fact and
Comment section that led each issue of his magazine. There, Forbes
gave a highly personal account of everything from the key business
and political issues of the day to pop culture, favorite books and
restaurants.
   In the latest issue dated March 5, Forbes opined that fiber
optics and satellite technology were likely to overcome cable
television, urged the establishment of national standards on
education to help the United States compete with Japan and Europe,
and applauded President Bush for his personal diplomacy with major
world leaders.
   ``He may sound more cautious than those impressed by dramatic
hip-shooting would like. But we are mighty fortunate that in
situations of international inflammability he knows to whom to
talk. And knows what he's talking about.''
   Forbes also put in a plug for his own personal diplomacy: the
lending of nine of his 12 Faberge eggs to a Kremlin exhibition,
carried to the heart of Communist power aboard his own Boeing 727
emblazoned ``Capitalist Tool.''
   ``It is the first time in my life that I have really been
wholeheartedly rooting for the stability and survival of the
Russian government as presently constituted _ at the least, for the
duration of the exhibit!'' he wrote.
   Forbes spiced up his column with a sprinkling of witticisms,
which were collected in two volumes, the most recent being ``The
Further Sayings of Chairman Malcolm'' in 1986.
   He had plenty of advice for his magazine's target audience, the
nation's corporate managers:
   ``He who has the wheel determines the direction.''
   ``In management, the staid seldom stay long.''
   ``If you have no critics you likely have no successes.''
   ``Attention is to people what fertilizer is to flowers.''
   He also wrote frequently on wealth, suggesting that anyone who
strived hard could achieve it but that wealth alone didn't give a
person's true measure:
   ``Money seldom changes people. It just makes them more visible.''
   ``Subtract a person's material worth and what's left is his real
worth.''
   ``To be free, one must have `bread.'''
   ``Alchemy isn't a myth _ Attitude and action can turn anyone and
anything golden.''
   But some of his more memorable quips dealt simply with living,
something Forbes sought to do in great style:
   ``For enhancing any meal, the only thing that beats good wine is
a better one. Come to think of it, even a poor one is better than
none at all.''
   ``Style is one thing, fashion usually quite another.''
   ``If you don't enjoy the climb, giving what it takes to get to
the top isn't worth it.''
   ``Criticizing doers is far less fun than doing.''
   ``As you get older _ Don't slow down. Speed up. There's less
time left.''
   Ironically, his most recent book, ``They Went That-a-way,''
described the ``extraordinary exits,'' as he put it, of 175 famous
historical figures.
   Forbes said he wanted to satisfy ``an oft-expressed curiosity on
the part of Us, the Living. When some well-known name pops up in
conversation, how many times have we said, `Whatever became of
him-her?'''
   He denied having any morbid fascination with death itself,
though.
   ``Since it's life's only certainty, and since being against it
isn't apt to affect the result, dwelling on death strikes me as a
woeful, wanton waste of time,'' he wrote.
   ``It seems to me life is for the living.''

<HEAD>Nordstrom Fourth-Quarter Earnings Fall 34 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nordstrom Inc. said today its earnings fell 34
percent in the fourth quarter due largely to higher merchandise
markdowns and a $15 million charge for estimated back wage claims
by employees.
   For the three-month period ended Jan. 31, Nordstrom's profits
fell to $31.4 million or 39 cents a share, from $47.5 million or 58
cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 12 percent to $857.5
million from $765.1 million.
   The upscale department store, which recently came under fire for
allegedly exploiting employees, said it has responded to a
Washington state Department of Labor and Industry ruling by
implementing additional record-keeping procedures to ensure all
employee work is properly recorded and compensated.
   The state labor agency ruled recently that Nordstrom had a
pattern of making sales clerks work during off-hours and not paying
them for it, following a complaint by Locals 367 and 1001 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers union. It ordered the company to
calculate and pay them uncompensated hours retroactive two years.
   Nordstrom spokesman John Goesling said the company has
established a $15 million reserve for back wage claims.
   ``That's our estimate at the present time'' of what the back pay
claims in Washington state will be, Goesling said.
   The union had estimated claims in Washington could reach between
$30 million and $40 million.
   The company also attributed the drop in fourth-quarter net
income to ``higher merchandise markdowns and shrinkage,'' a
euphemism for in-house theft.
   For the year, Nordstrom earned $114.9 million or $1.41 a share,
down 7 percent from $123.3 million or $1.51 a share in the previous
year. Sales totaled $2.7 billion, up nearly 15 percent from $2.3
billion.
   The company also said it has instituted a claims procedure for
reimbursing back pay. The claims forms have been sent to Nordstrom
sales employees in other states, but not in Washington, where the
forms must be reviewed by the state's labor office and the two
union locals.
   The company is attempting to arrange meetings so that those
forms may be mailed out in Washington by the end of the week,
Goesling said.
   Nordstrom also said that it also expects a class action lawsuit
to be filed on behalf of certain shareholders. Such a suit, if
filed, would allege that the company knew or should have known that
unpaid work and overtime claims by employees would adversely affect
the price of Nordstrom stock and that the company should have made
a disclosure to this effect, the company said in a statement.
   In a meeting last Tuesday, the board of directors voted to
increase the quarterly dividend to 7.5 cents per share, payable
March 15 to shareholders of record March 5.

<HEAD>Rig Count Declined by 21</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
continued its first quarter trend and declined by 21 this week to
897, Baker Hughes Inc. reported.
   The year-to-date count, however, remains 19 percent above last
year's pace, according to Ike Kerridge Jr., an economist with Baker
Hughes. This year, the count has averaged 960 rigs, while last year
at this time, the count averaged 806, he said Monday.
   Kerridge said the rig count generally declines during the first
quarter and is expected to bottom out in March or April although
last year it bottomed out in May.
   Last week the rig count increased for the first time in 1990
when it jumped by 19 rigs to total 918. A year ago, the count was
757.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas saw drastic activity for
the third straight week posting a loss of eight rigs. Last week it
gained 16 and slipped by seven the previous week.
   Oklahoma this week had the biggest decline with 13 after no
activity last week. Other states posting losses were California and
North Dakota with one each.
   States posting gains for the week included Kansas, seven;
Pennsylvania, two; and Louisiana and Wyoming, one each.
   There were no changes in the number of rigs operating in
Colorado, Michigan, New Mexico and Ohio.

   Domestic coal production totaled 20.3

Department of Energy reported Monday.
   The U.S. coal industry produced 19.4 million tons in the same

Administration.
   Kentucky ranked first among the 27 coal-producing states with
3.48 million tons produced. Wyoming was second at 3.2 million tons

<HEAD>EC Criticizes U.S. On Telecom Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing body of the European
Community Monday criticized the United States for keeping it on a
list of trade partners considered trade offenders in the
telecommunications sector.
   According to a statement by the EC Commission, the 12-nation
group ``made substantial progress'' in tearing down telecom trade
barriers in 1989, and ``regretted'' that it had not been struck off
the U.S. list of telecommunications trade offenders.
   The United States first put the European Community on its
so-called priority list in 1986 after U.S. companies said European
Community governments had unfair procurement policies and
complained they were locked out of the Community's telecom
equipment and services markets.
   According to EC officials, U.S. telecom exports to the European
Community rose to $788 million in 1988 from $569 million in 1987 as
a result of the market-opening measures. During the same period,
the European Community exported $370 million worth of equipment to
the United States, up from $243 million.
   Under its trade laws, the United States last week had to either
impose countermeasures against the European Community for its
telecommunications policy, drop its name from the list, or extend
its place on the list for another year.
   The commission said the measures taken so far to open its
telecom market justified being removed from the U.S. list.
Officials said the EC market for telecom equipment has been open
since 1988, and argue that European Community governments have
agreed in principle to open telecom markets for services and in
public procurement.
   A U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said he was not
surprised by the commission's reaction.
   But he said that while progress has been made in opening up the
market for telecommunications equipment, advances so far in
services and public procurement amount to ``preliminary political
steps'' that could not justify removing the European Community from
the priority list of trade offenders.

   The stock market was mixed in moderate trading
today with buyers turning to blue chips in the wake of a severe
setback in Tokyo.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 19.59 to 2,583.78
by noon on Wall Street.
   But the broader market had a tougher time. Declining issues
maintained a narrowing lead over advancing ones of about a 9-to-8
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with 600 up, 672 down and
506 unchanged.
   The composite index of all NYSE-listed issues added 0.73 to
180.08.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board amounted to 61.52 million
shares at midday, down from 81.50 million at the same point on
Friday.
   Wall Street analysts said although there was uneasiness about
the severe selloff in Tokyo traders took comfort from the limited
impact the slump had on markets elsewhere around the world. Stocks
in London, Frankfurt, West Germany and other financial centers
posted only marginal declines.
   Strength in the dollar and in the bond market also deflected the
shock waves in the aftermatch of the tumble on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, the world's biggest equities market. The main index of
the Tokyo market plunged by 1,569.10 points, second only to its
``Black Monday'' decline in October 1987.
   Gene Seagle, vice president and director of technical research
at Gruntal Financial Inc., said the U.S. market's ability to
weather the Tokyo plunge without losing its composure relieved
anxieties that world markets had become intimately linked.
   He said Japanese money managers apparently were buying U.S.
securities today.
   Pfizer topped the Big Board's list of actively trading stocks

   Among the active blue chips, IBM gained { to 103&lsqb;, Merck was

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy is in ``a danger zone'' but
will avoid a recession in the next three years, according to a
survey of the nation's top business economists released today that
found little hope of ending inflation.
   The survey by the National Association of Business Economists
found 60.6 percent of the professional forecasters believing the
economy will skirt a recession through 1992, nearly the same as the
62.1 percent making the same prediction in the last survey released
in December.
   NABE President James F. Smith said the biggest news in the
survey is its confirmation of the ``sea change'' of optimism among
the participants in December. A NABE survey last May found 63
percent of the economists expecting a recession this year.
   ``There was some trepidation that was a fluke,'' Smith said at a
news conference called to release the new survey. ``Fortunately, it
wasn't.''
   Smith, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina,
cautioned that ``we have not repealed the business cycle and we
will have a recession some day.''
   But, he added, ``our members are confident ... that we will
shatter all recordso good-faith bargaining with
Greyhound management,'' president Edward M. Strait said in a
statement. ``It is our sincere hope that these discussions produce
positive results.''

<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp., the nation's eighth
largest defense contractor, reached a tentative labor agreement
with the union representing about 20,000 workers for the aerospace
firm.
   The tentative contract reached early Sunday still must be
ratified by rank and file members of the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A nationwide vote was
scheduled for March 4.
   ``We feel it's the best contract that we can negotiate at this
time, especially with government audits,'' union negotiator Bob
Gregory said Sunday, referring to government monitoring of
Lockheed's hourly compensation costs.
   Tom Goff, spokesman for the Calabasas-based Lockheed, confirmed
that the two sides had reached a tentative agreement. A week
earlier, union members rejected management's latest offer by a 98
percent margin.
   The union said Lockheed's earlier offer was inadequate and set
up a two-tier wage structure.
   As part of the tentative agreement, both sides declined to
disclose terms of the contract until the rank-and-file votes.
   The union workers have been operating under an extension of the
previous three-year contract that expired last October. The present
contract offer will be retroactive to October and runs through
March 1, 1993, Gregory said.
   The union's Local District 727 represents 6,000 workers in
Burbank and Palmdale. The contract also covers workers at Lockheed
plants in Sunnyvale and Marietta, Ga.
   Contract talks had resumed Thursday in Florida and concluded
early Sunday.
   Asked about changes in the contract offer's pension plan,
Gregory said that it establishes an employee stock ownership plan
for union members.
   Lockheed set up an employee stock-ownership plan for salaried
employees last April. The plan, designed to strengthen the company
against take-over attempts, gave salaried workers control of 17
percent of the company.

<HEAD>Perrier Says Its Recall Nearly Complete</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Source Perrier SA today said it was
planning to restock its sparkling water on supermarket shelves in
six to eight weeks, following a worldwide recall due to benzene
contamination.
   The company, from its headquarters in Paris, said it was
implementing a series of ``stringent new inspection measures''
before production resumes, including new monitoring and testing
procedures and double filtering of the carbon dioxide gas that goes
into its sparkling water from Vergeze in France.
   It said a timetable for reintroduction would be established when
all tests are completed and the new procedures are in effect, but
estimated the familiar green bottles would be back on the shelf
within two months.
   Perrier recalled 160 million bottles worldwide after benzene was
found in some bottles overseas. The company first recalled 72
million bottles in North America, attributing the problem to an
employee who inadvertently contaminated a bottling machine by
cleaning it with benzene.
   The company later expanded the recall worldwide and acknowledged
that benzene is found naturally in the carbon dioxide gas. The gas
is extracted separately from the spring water before the two are
combined in the Perrier plant for bottling.
   Perrier said the contamination occurred because workers failed
to replace filters designed to remove the benzene from the carbon
dioxide.
   In a statement from Paris, where Source Perrier is located, the
company cited experts as saying the water source was pure and no
one's health was ever at risk because of the benzene.
   It said a small amount of minor elements is found in all
naturally occurring gases, and said all companies that use carbon
dioxide in carbonated beverages filter the gas to remove small
levels of such compounds.
   ``All international medical experts and regulatory officials
consulted on the matter confirm that the health of Perrier
consumers was never in danger,'' the company said.
   However, Source Perrier said it was instituting new measures to
assure the purity of its product. It said the gas system would be
checked twice a day, both before and after the filtering stage. The
gas will be filtered twice, and the company will conduct specific
tests for hydrocarbonate compounds. It also said backup
verification would be conducted by an outside laboratory and a team
of international experts.
   Perrier said its recall is 90 percent complete. The 72 million
bottles in North America will be destroyed and recycled in
facilities approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   Several suits have been filed against Perrier and its U.S.
affiliate, Perrier Group of America Inc. of Greenwich, Conn.,
charging that customers have been damaged by the benzene
contamination. The suits, filed in Connecticut and Pennsylvania,
seek class actions against the companies.

<HEAD>Piper Shuts Down Plant For Two Weeks; Works Laid Off Temporarily</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   VERO BEACH, Fla (CP) _ Financially troubled Piper Aircraft Corp.
shut down its plant here for two weeks today and laid off more than
three-fourths of its workers, a company spokesman said.
   Joe Ponte, director of marketing, said the layoffs are the
result of a severe cash crunch and that the company did not plan to
seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law.
   ``It's not Chapter 11, just layoffs and a shutdown,'' said Ponte.
   About 580 workers will be on an extended layoff, he said. The
rest of the nearly 1,100 employees will return to work March 12,
after the shutdown, he said.
   ``We have a tremendous backlog in aircraft on order,'' Ponte
said in an interview.
   About 300 people remain on the job to help deal with backlogs in
aircraft deliveries, he said.
   Piper, which manufactures aircraft for general aviation, was
purchased by California investor M. Stuart Millar from Forstmann
Little and Co. in 1987. No purchase price was disclosed.
   Ponte said the company will go to a four-day work week after the
shutdown to help the company get back on its feet.
   He said the problems resulted from a rapid expansion of the
company after Stuart Millar bought the company in 1987.
   ``We tried to minimize debt and tried to fund rapid growth with
cash flow and we really underestimated how much it would require,''
Ponte said.
   Ponte said Piper had to take drastic action to deal with the
problem. He said people ordering aircraft and parts might
experience delays but they will receive their products.
   Piper has had trouble competing with the giant Cessna Aircraft
Co. , which is controlled by General Dynamics Corp., a U.S. defense
contractor.
   Cessna surpassed Piper in 1967 to become the world's leading
aircraft manufacturer in total units sold.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index suffered its
second largest one-day fall today, and exchange officials
reportedly sought to restrict a form of computer-guided trading
seen as a major factor in recent declines.
   The dollar closed sharply higher.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average plunged 1,569.10 points, or
4.5 percent, closing at 33,321.87, its lowest level since 33,309.71
last July 5.
   Today's plunge was second only to the 3,836.48 on Oct. 20, 1987.
That fall of 14.9 percent, however, still was well below the
previous day's 22.6 percent on Wall Street, on the ``Black Monday''
that triggered a global crash.
   Volume was a light 400 million shares on the first section.
   Analysts said stock, bond and yen prices were driving each other
down in a vicious cycle.
   Meanwhile, stock prices rose New York with the Dow Jones average
of 30 industrials up 24.55 points to 2,588.74 at 1:30 p.m. EST.
Share prices finished higher in London. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index gained 12.6 points to close at 2,249.3.
   In an effort to stop the fall in stock prices, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange asked that securities firms limit their index arbitrage
selling to the beginning of the morning and afternoon sessions
until March 8, Kyodo News Service reported without elaborating.
   In arbitrage trading, which also was cited as a cause for Wall
Street's ``Black Monday'' crash, investors profit from differences
in prices for the same security in different markets, for instance,
the spot and future markets. Computers spot the price gaps and
guide the trading.
   But arbitrageurs, seen by many analysts as the key factor in the
Nikkei's 2,570-point loss for all of last week, were not very
active today as futures prices fell the maximum amount allowed
during the morning session.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar rose 2.18 yen,
closing at 148.65 yen. It opened at 147.50 yen and ranged between
147.42 yen and 149.05 yen. The dollar now has gained 4.13 yen in
the last five trading days.
   The bond market held firm in today's trading. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year government bonds closed at 6.875 percent, down
slightly from its 6.98 percent opening.
   At one point today, the Nikkei average fell to 32,477.46 points,
2,413.51 beneath its Friday close.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst for Nomura Securities, said that
about an hour before the market's close, some investors began to
feel stock prices were reasonable again. The index climbed 844.41
points in the last hour.
   Because of overall light trading, the few buy orders had a large
impact on the index, Umemori added.
   Robert Alan Feldman, an economist for Salomon Brothers Asia
Ltd., said such last-minute turnarounds were common on the Tokyo
market and did not signify that the market's fall had been stopped.
   Johsen Takahashi, director of Mitsubishi Research Institute
Inc., said the Tokyo market's problem was ``cheap yen, cheap stocks
and cheap bonds _ the decline of each one has accelerated the
decline of the other two.''
   In a vicious cycle, analysts said, the weakening of the bond
market had reduced demand for the yen, whose cheap value reduced
the attractiveness of buying stocks.
   Takahashi said Japan might be able to stem the stock market's
decline by lowering interest rates, but such action was unlikely
because it might accelerate the country's already overheating
economy.
   A rapidly expanding money supply as well as a tightening labor
market have led to growing inflation in the country in the last few
months.
   ``Japan's domestic boom has been too good,'' he said, and this
has led to an overevaluation of the yen as well as stock prices.
   The Bank of Japan sold an estimated $1.6 billion in efforts to
support the yen.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said today he was concerned
about recent changes in the stock, bond and foreign exchange
markets but saw no immediate need for changes in monetary policy.
   ``We don't change monetary policy only because stock prices
moved rapidly or the yen moved rapidly. We base a change in
monetary policy on an overall consideration of economic conditions,
prices, currency rates, money supply and others,'' he said.
   In Hong Kong, meanwhile, share prices closed lower in thinner
trading in response to the Tokyo market's plunge. The Hang Seng
Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips, lost 21.68 points,
or 0.75 percent, closing at 2,872.63.
   In Sydney, shares closed sharply lower in response to the fall
in Tokyo. The all-ordinary share price index fell 35.3 points to
1,545.7, down 2.2 percent.

   Waldenbooks is launching a new program that
combines incentives to attract customers with a high-tech purchase
tracking system for use in individualized marketing to readers,
Waldenbooks' chief executive said Monday.
   The ``Preferred Reader'' program being rolled out Friday is the
latest step in Waldenbooks' campaign to promote itself as a
service-oriented retailer and distinguish itself from such
competitors as B. Dalton or Brentano's.
   Harry Hoffman, president and chief executive officer of the
nation's largest bookstore chain, said Waldenbooks will be the
first in its field to use such a technologically sophisticated
approach to monitor what customers buy.
   ``We think this kind of program will build a loyal customer
base, increase our share of the market and provide people who like
books ... with outstanding information and keep them more aware of
what's happening in the book business on a monthly basis,'' he said
in an interview.
   ``I think the ability to reach people who we know are interested
in what we have is going to be a tremendous opportunity to get a
better return from advertising than we had in the past,'' he said.
   A customer can sign up for the program in a store or by calling
a toll-free number.
   For a $10 annual membership fee, preferred readers receive 10
percent off every purchase and get back $5 for every $100 spent.
The membership fee will be cut in half, to $5, during the March
kick-off. Checks will automatically be accepted when shoppers show
their preferred reader cards to cashiers.
   Each card will carry an individualized bar code allowing
Waldenbooks to record via computer what a customer buys. The
information will be used by Waldenbooks, which is based in
Stamford, Conn. and owned by K mart Corp., to target specific
tastes when sending news or special discounts by mail.
   Hoffman said every program member will receive a monthly
brochure containing general information about books, authors, and
similar topics.
   Inserts occasionally will be included. Science fiction fans will
get advance notice of a pending title while mystery readers will
receive coupons for discounts off future purchases of books in that
genre, for example.
   The program, being implemented at all 1,250 Waldenbooks stores,
eventually will replace the genre specific clubs the company has
had for years, said Ron Jaffe, senior director of marketing. New
members no longer will be enrolled in the current clubs, which
cater to people with particular reading interests.
   Jaffe said in an interview that the existing clubs, members of
which will be offered free one-year memberships in the preferred
reader program, have about 3{ million people as active participants.
   Jaffe said the program is part of a $15 million campaign in
Waldenbooks' repositioning. ``We really hope that by doing this we
become the bookstore of choice when someone is out buying books,''
he said.
   Besides upgrading its use of database marketing, Jaffe said the
chain over the past year or so has undertaken other changes. Store
displays and category presentations have been redesigned to be more
``reader friendly'' and individual stores have greater flexibility
to stock books that satisfy local market preferences.
   Among other benefits of the new preferred reader program,
members will be able to order books by telephone, selecting from
100,000 titles available at the company's Nashville, Tenn.
distribution warehouse. Operators will be able to search by
computer for hard-to-find books.
   Non-members also will be allowed to call the 800-number but they
won't be eligible for the discounted prices.
   Hoffman said Waldenbooks will redirect a significant portion of
its $10 million to $12 million annual advertising budget to support
the program, cutting back outlays on some conventional methods,
such as catalogs in magazines.
   Target marketing has advantages over the ``shotgun approach'' of
running ads in newspapers, said Hoffman, noting: ``I think most
retailers in the '90s are going to have to look at this type of
program.''

   Stock prices finished higher on London's Stock
Exchange Monday, as late afternoon buying reversed early declines
following another market plunge in Tokyo.
   London stocks initially were battered by the Nikkei index's
second worst showing in Tokyo since the October 1987 crash. But
later in the session, London stocks rose after a bullish start on
Wall Street, dealers said.
   By the close of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial
Average was up 20.94 points at 2,585.13.
   ``The blood bath some were suggesting on Wall Street just didn't
appear,'' said one head of dealing at a London investment firm.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 12.6
points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 2,249.3, bounding back from a
low of 2,208.4 minutes after official trading began.
   Volume was 337 million shares, compared with 472.6 million
shares Friday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the Nikkei index plummeted 1,569.10 to
33,321.87 in its third sharp drop in less than a week. Dealers
cited the belief that the Japanese market was overvalued and fears
of higher interest rates.
   Following Tokyo's gyrations last week, the London market reacted
bearishly but without the signs of hysteria associated with the
unexpected plunges in New York share prices in October 1989 and
October 1987.

   The U.S. dollar rose Monday against other major
foreign currencies in Europe, fueled by the Tokyo stock market's
steepest one-day decline since the October 1987 global crash.
   Gold prices were lower.
   The dollar benefited from nervousness over the declines in Tokyo
stock prices last week and expectations that further weakness is
likely, said Reijer Groenveld, a dealer with Bank of America in
London.
   Dealers said the drop on the Tokyo stock market fortified
perceptions that the Bank of Japan won't move quickly to raise
interest rates, even though officials say they are increasingly
worried about the yen's weakness.
   The Bank of Japan repeatedly sold dollars for yen to boost the
Japanese currency, dealers said. But the large-scale intervention
was viewed as reinforcing speculation that the underlying trend in
the yen is downward, Groenveld and other dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 148.65 Japanese yen from
146.47 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.80
yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6927 from $1.7090 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6903 West German marks, up from 1.6779; 1.4865
Swiss francs, up from 1.4770; 5.7205 French francs, up from 5.6715;
1.9023 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8890; 1,250.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,240.75, and 1.1975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $411.75 a troy ounce from
$416.50 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$411.25 an ounce from $415.50 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.47 an ounce to close at
$412.15.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.23 a troy
ounce, down from $5.27 late Friday.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as old crop wheat prices
posted gains while new crop futures fell.
   March wheat futures prices rose on scattered commission house
buying in anticipation that deliveries will be small because of low
stocks, analysts said.
   The offer to the Soviet Union on Friday by the U.S. Agriculture
Department of 1 million metric tons of wheat under the export bonus
program had little influence on the market because it had been
widely rumored last week, analysts said.
   The market now is waiting for an actual tender by the Soviet
Union for direction.
   Pat O'Connell, an analyst for Refco Inc., said the corn
deliveries also are expected to small but the expectation of rain
in western crop areas weighed on the market.
   Soybean prices were lower Monday, kept on the defensive by a
rash of commission house and professional selling. Rain in South
American crop areas also weighed on the soybean market.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.96{ a bushel; corn was 2
cents lower to a { cent higher with March at $2.46\ a bushel; oats

   The stock market kept its composure in the wake
of a nasty tumble on Tokyo's exchange and managed a moderate
advance today.
   Buyers focused their attention on blue-chip stocks. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials finished on a strong note, boosted
by a late rally, after sporting more modest gains for most of the
session.
   The rally in the blue chips helped pull the broader market into
the plus column.
   Although uneasiness about the selloff in Tokyo permeated the
market, traders took comfort from the limited impact the slump had
on stocks elsewhere around the world. The market in London, for
instance, finished its session in positive territory after some
initial bearishness subsided.
   Strength in the dollar also helped deflect the shock waves from
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's biggest equities market. The
main index of the Tokyo market plunged by 1,569.10 points, a
decline that was second in size only to the drop in October 1987.
   Gene Seagle, vice president and director of technical research
at Gruntal Financial Inc., said the U.S. market's ability to cope
with the Tokyo drop without losing its composure relieved anxieties
that world markets had become too intimately linked.
   He said Japanese money managers apparently were buying U.S.
securities today after bailing out of their domestic market.

<HEAD>Earnings Fall 34 Percent in 4th Quarter; $15 Million Charge For
Back Pay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fashion retailer Nordstrom Inc. said Monday its
fourth quarter earnings dropped 34 percent from a year earlier
because of higher merchandise markdowns and a $15 million provision
for estimated back pay claims.
   Separately, the Nordstrom workers union leader called the back
wage provision inadequate and said the union planned to file a
class-action lawsuit against the clothing store chain.
   Nordstrom acknowledged the threat of that suit and said it
believed it also may face a class-action shareholder suit.
   For the three-month period ended Jan. 31, Nordstrom's profits
fell to $31.4 million or 39 cents a share, from $47.5 million or 58
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 12 percent to $857.5
million in the quarter from $765.1 million.
   In addition to the charge for back wage payments, Nordstrom
attributed the drop in fourth-quarter net income to higher
merchandise markdowns. Industry analysts have said the company had
to respond to aggressive price-cutting by its competitors during
the Christmas season.
   For the year, Nordstrom's profit fell 7 percent to $114.9
million, or $1.41 a share, from $123.3 million, or $1.51 a share,
in the previous year. Sales totaled $2.7 billion, up nearly 15
percent from $2.3 billion in the previous year.
   Nordstrom, which has built a reputation for good customer
service, has been accused of allegedly pressuring employees to
sometimes perform work without compensation.
   Following a labor union complaint, the Washington state
Department of Labor and Industry ruled earlier this month that
Nordstrom had a pattern of making sales clerks work during
off-hours without compensation and ordered the company to pay them
for two years' worth of uncompensated hours.
   Nordstrom said Monday it had responded to the ruling by adopting
additional record-keeping procedures to ensure employee work
properly was recorded and paid. It also said it had instituted a
claims procedure for reimbursing back pay.
   The $15 million reserve for back wage claims represented the
company's present estimate of claims for Washington state, said
spokesman John Goesling.
   Joe Peterson, president of United Food &amp; Commercial Workers
Union Local 1001, said the back wage fund is ``wholly inadequate.
It won't even cover claims of employees in Washington state, let
alone claims in Alaska, Utah, Oregon, California and Virginia.''
   Nordstrom has 60 stores in Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, Virginia and Utah. It plans 16 more, including moving into
Illinois, New Jersey, Maryland, Minnesota, Indiana, Connecticut,
Massachusetts and New York.
   Peterson said the union estimates Nordstrom could be liable for
up to $40 million in claims in Washington and for more than $200
million in back pay and penalties in California. The union has not
yet studied possible claims in the other states, he said.
   Peterson also said the claims procedure was an attempt by the
company to bargain directly with workers instead of the union over
claims.
   Last week, the National Labor Relations Board complained that
Nordstrom had been improperly bargaining directly with employees
over back wages, rather than going through the union.
   Peterson said the UFCW could file its lawsuit this week, unless
the company showed a willingness to negotiate a settlement with the
union.
   Nordstrom said it expects a class-action lawsuit to be filed on
behalf of certain shareholders. Such a suit, if filed, would allege
the company should have disclosed that unpaid work and overtime
claims by employees adversely would affect the price of Nordstrom
stock, the company said.
   Nordstrom stock has fallen from a Sept. 1 high of $41.75 a share
to $29.25 a share at Monday's close.

   Pfizer Inc. shareholders filed a lawsuit Monday
accusing company executives of withholding information about the
financial impact of defects in a mechanical heart valve made by its
Shiley Inc. unit.
   Pfizer stock has been battered in recent days because of
potential liabilities from defects in a heart valve product that
was removed from the market after reports of malfunctions that
killed patients.
   The class-action lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, was brought on behalf of shareholders who purchased
Pfizer stock between March 27, 1988, and last Thursday, when a
House subcommittee announced it would hold hearings on the heart
valve.
   The shareholders said the price of Pfizer stock tumbled after
the announcement of the hearing by the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee, which began Monday.
   They also claimed that Pfizer, without telling shareholders, had
settled numerous cases involving Shiley heart valves out of court,
many for $1 million or more.
   ``None of the information publicly disseminated by Pfizer during
the class period gave any indication of the true nature or extent
of the problems experienced by the company with its Shiley heart
valve,'' said the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit names Pfizer Chief Executive Edmund T. Pratt Jr. and
six other executives. The shareholders are seeking unspecified
damages for alleged losses.
   ``There is no merit to the suit and we will vigorously defend
it,'' Pfizer spokesman Rick Honey said. Pfizer, is headquartered in
Manhattan and incorporated in Delaware.
   Pfizer stock, which has dropped about $14 in recent weeks in
apparent anticipation of the congressional hearings, lost another
25 cents Monday, closing at $56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The so-called 60-degree Shiley valve has been implanted in
85,000 people, including about 40,000 in the United States. The FDA
approved the valve for U.S. marketing in April 1979, but after
reports of malfunctions and product withdrawals, Shiley removed it
from the market in November 1986.
   The valve consists of a disc inside a metal ring covered by a
teflon sewing ring that is sutured to the heart to hold the valve
in place. The disc, pivoting on two thin metal struts, opens to
either a 60-degree or 70-degree angle to allow blood to flow
through, and then closes.
   About 4,000 of Shiley's 70-degree valves have been implanted in
patients overseas. That device was never marketed in the United
States.
   Shiley has reported to the Food and Drug Administration a total
of 295 fractures of the 60-degree valve, with 178 deaths resulting,
and 94 fractures and 70 deaths involving the 70-degree valve,
according to a report by the House subcommittee.
   At the hearing Monday, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of
the investigations subcommittee, said there has been ``no assurance
that the (FDA) procedures that allowed the heart valve to stay on
the market so long have been corrected.''
   The Democratci majority on the panel issued a report stating
that Shiley exploited the FDA's honor system by failing to notify
the agency of product changes and reports of malfunctions.

   The dollar climbed broadly Monday in foreign
exchange trading, reaching its highest levels in eight months
against the Japanese yen despite reported efforts by monetary
authorities in Japan and the United States to curb its advance.
   Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a
bid for gold at $408.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $7 from
Friday's late bid.
   Another sharp decline in the Tokyo stock market overnight helped
the dollar because the decline reduced chances that Japanese
authorities would raise interest rates there, analysts said.
   ``They can't raise interest rates because that would send their
stock and real estate markets into a tailspin,'' said Jerry
Rothman, a currency broker for Elders Futures Inc.
   He said the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve Board each
intervened in the currency markets during the trading day in an
effort to curb the dollar's rise and stop the yen's fall.
   But Rothman and other dealers said the dollar sales by the
central banks failed to drive the dollar lower.
   ``This is the highest dollar level against the yen since last
June,'' Rothman said. ``But there is little they can do about it
short of raising interest rates.''
   Karen Gibbs, a senior vice president in financial futures at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said the dollar also
benefited from its traditional role as a safe haven because of the
financial uncertainty in Japan.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 148.65 Japanese yen from
146.47 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 148.80
yen. In New York, the dollar rose to 148.63 yen from 147.07 yen.
   The dollar gained ground against the British pound. In London,
the pound fell to $1.6927 from $1.7090 late Friday. In New York,
the pound fell to $1.6903 from $1.7092.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6882 West German marks, up from 1.6785; 1.4860
Swiss francs, up from 1.4740; 5.7140 French francs, up from 5.6825;
1,248.50 Italian lire, up from 1,241.50, and 1.19405 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.19825.
   Late rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included:
1.6903 West German marks, up from 1.6779; 1.4865 Swiss francs, up
from 1.4770; 5.7205 French francs, up from 5.6715; 1.9023 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8890; 1,250.25 Italian lire, up from 1,240.75,
and 1.1975 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1965.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for curent delivery
dropped $6.30 an ounce to $408.70.
   Earlier, gold fell to $411.75 a troy ounce in London from
$416.50 late Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$411.25 an ounce from $415.50 late Friday. In Hong Kong, gold lost
$2.47 an ounce to close at $412.15.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $5.23 a troy
ounce, down from $5.27 late Friday. In New York, silver for current
delivery fell 9.1 cents an ounce to $5.147 on the Commodity
Exchange.

   The stock market kept its composure in the wake
of a nasty tumble on Tokyo's exchange and managed a convincing
advance Monday.
   Buyers focused their attention on blue-chip stocks and a late
rally propelled the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials sharply
higher. The key indicator finished with a gain of 38.29 at
2,602.48, snapping a string of five straight declines.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
822 up, 639 down and 492 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to a moderate 148.91
million shares, only slightly above the 148.49 million traded in
Friday's session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.43 million shares.
   Despite uneasiness about the selloff in Tokyo, investors
refrained from dumping stocks in the United States. Traders took
comfort from the limited impact the Tokyo slump had on stocks
elsewhere around the world. The market in London, for instance,
finished its session in positive territory after initial
bearishness subsided.
   Strength in the dollar also helped deflect the shock waves from
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the world's biggest equities market. The
exchange's main index, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average, plunged
1,569.10 points, or 4.5 percent, closing at 33,321.87, its lowest
level since 33,309.71 last July 5.
   It was the largest point drop since the loss of 3,836.48 on Oct.
20, 1987. Gene Seagle, vice president and director of technical
research at Gruntal Financial Inc., said the U.S. market's ability
to cope with the Tokyo drop without losing its composure relieved
anxieties that world markets had become too intimately linked.
   There also was a perception that Tokyo's troubles were unique
and unrelated to the U.S. market.
   In another positive influence on the U.S. market, Japanese money
managers apparently bought U.S. securities after bailing out of
their domestic market.
   Florida Progress topped the Big Board's list of actively traded
issues and closed down &lsqb; at 37}. Texas Utilities, the second most
heavily traded stock, gained { to 35&lsqb;.
   Pfizer fell \ to 56 and ranked third on the actives' list. It
also slid Friday amid worries about product-liability problems
related to defective heart valves formerly made by one of its units.
   A Congressional subcommittee began hearings on the valves and
criticized the company and the Food and Drug Administration for
their handling of the situation.
   Among the active blue chips, IBM jumped 1&rsqb; to 104, AT&amp;T added 1
to 39&lsqb;, Philip Morris rose \ to 37}, General Electric went up } to
61\, General Motors advanced 1&lsqb; to 44{ and Sears rose { to 40{.
   One point-plus loser among the actively trading issues was
Homestake, off 1} at 19|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $28.65 billion, or 0.91
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks went
up 1.91 to 181.26.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.36 to 378.51, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 4.52 at 328.67.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.43 to 420.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 350.36, off 0.74.

<HEAD>Wall Street Avoids Tokyo Market's Plunge; Strong Bonds, Dollar
Credited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street shrugged off the latest bad news from Japan, and the
U.S. stock market closed higher Monday despite the Tokyo market's
second-worst drop ever.
   Markets in London and Frankfurt also showed strength following
the latest plunge in Tokyo, where stock prices have been on a
sustained decline from record highs reached in late 1989.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose
38.29 points to 2,602.48. Broader market indicators also rose, with
advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 9 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.
   Earlier, the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
225-share Nikkei Stock Average, finished down 1,569.10 points, at
33,321.87.
   That loss was second only to the 3,836.48-point drop on Oct. 20,
1987, after Wall Street's Black Monday, and gave the index a total
loss of more than 14 percent since the year began.
   But analysts said higher bond prices and the strength of the
dollar in foreign exchange contributed to the resiliency of the
U.S. market. They also said Monday's rise shows the link between
Wall Street and Tokyo isn't as strong as once thought.
   ``I think this is a continuation of what we saw last week,''
said Gordon L. Smith, a managing director at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons
Inc., a Baltimore brokerage. ``It looks like we've decoupled the
markets at least temporarily.''
   Two sharp drops in the Tokyo market last week caused nervousness
on Wall Street but no severe selloffs.
   Prices on other overseas markets generally closed lower Monday
in the wake of Tokyo's selloff. However, European markets recovered
some of the losses suffered in early trading and Britain's market
ended higher.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
rose 12.6 points to close at 2,249.3. Dealers said the market was
boosted by the strong showing on Wall Street.
   Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange closed lower but
well above their lows for the day when the market rebounded after
an opening plunge. Earlier, in Hong Kong, share prices closed lower
in thin trading.
   A.C. Moore, research director for Argus Research in New York,
said the U.S. markets were boosted by increased buying in
stock-index futures related to the strong bond market.
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose about $5.94 per $1,000
in face amount, while its yield fell to 8.48 percent from 8.55
percent late Friday.
   Rising bond prices ``tend to induce buying in stock index
futures, and when stock index futures go up that makes underlying
quality stock go up,'' said Moore.
   Moore said Wall Street's rally was surprising, but said it may
not last. He said the U.S. markets remain troubled by low corporate
profits and high interest rates.
   Jack Conlon Jr., a managing director at Rothschild Inc., said
Wall Street's performance Monday demonstrates that ``the factors
that are weighing the Japanese market are applicable to the
Japanese market in itself.''
   Among those, he said, are fear of higher Japanese interest rates
due to rising inflation and concern over domestic political
uncertainties.
   He also said Japanese investors have been less of a factor in
the U.S. stock markets in recent years. Some observers had feared
that with the Tokyo market falling, Japanese investors would pull
out of the U.S. markets due to a cash crunch.
   In Japan, top financial officials said Monday there was nothing
wrong with the nation's economic fundamentals despite the market
plunge.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said he was watching the
market developments with a sense of apprehension, ``but, at the
same time, with composure'' because Japan's strong corporate sales
and earnings have not softened.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters that the
plunge in stock prices and the depreciation of the yen against the
dollar was due to speculation, not worsening economic conditions.
   The dollar finished up 2.18 yen at 148.65 yen Monday in Tokyo _
its highest level in eight months.
   Low trading volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and computerized
index arbitrage trading, which can involve rapid trading of huge
amounts of shares, have been blamed in part for the market's recent
volatility.
   Kyodo News Service said the exchange asked securities firms to
limit their index arbitrage selling to the start of the morning and
afternoon trading sessions until March 8.
   Traders involved in index arbitrage attempt to profit from brief
discrepancies between the prices of stock-index futures and the
prices of the stocks they actually represent.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Plunge as Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metals futures prices plunged Monday on New York's
Commodity Exchange on heavy selling in Japan and the dollar's
renewed strength.
   On other markets, energy futures were sharply higher; grains and
soybeans were lower; livestock and pork futures declined; and cocoa
was sharply lower.
   Gold prices were pushed lower following heavy selling overnight
in Tokyo as after the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped sharply. The
sell-off in Tokyo was the exchange's steepest one-day decline since
the October 1987 global crash.
   ``A lot of gold assets were being liquidated to meet margin
calls,'' said Richard Levine, an analyst with Elders Futures Inc in
New York. ``The sell-off was particularly pronounced in platinum
because that is a traditional precious metal for the Japanese.''
   Silver prices did not fall as sharply but approached low levels,
Levine said.
   The dollar's strength made the precious metals less attractive
to investors. Analysts said the dollar benefited from nervousness
over the declines in Tokyo stock prices last week and expectations
that further weakness was likely.
   Gold settled $6.30 to $7.10 lower with the contract for delivery
in April at $411.80 a troy ounce; silver was 9.1 cents to 10.4
cents lower with March at $5.148 a troy ounce.
   Platinum was $15 to $15.40 lower with April at $511.10 a troy
ounce.
   Energy futures climbed on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with
outer months contracts showing the best gains.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 37 cents to 71 cents
higher with April at $21.79 a barrel; heating oil was .75 cent to
1.32 cents higher with March at 59.05 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .02 cent lower to 1.35 cents higher with March at
59.83 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   March wheat futures prices rose on scattered commission house
buying in anticipation deliveries will be small because of low
stocks, analysts said.
   The offer to the Soviet Union on Friday by the U.S. Department
of Agriculture of 1 million metric tons of wheat under the export
bonus program had little influence on the market because it had
been widely rumored, analysts said.
   The market now is waiting for an actual tender by the Soviet
Union for direction.
   Soybean prices were lower Monday, kept on the defensive by a
rash of commission house and professional selling. Rain in South
American crop areas also weighed on the soybean market.
   Wheat was 1\ cents lower to 2\ cents higher with March at $3.96\
a bushel; corn was 2 cents lower to a \ cent higher with March at
$2.46 a bushel; oats were a \ cent to 1 cents lower with March at
$1.36{ a bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with
March at $5.61} a bushel.
   Cocoa futures settled sharply lower on New York's Coffee, Sugar
and Cocoa Exchange, which analysts attributed to a record world
supply. Cocoa was $14 to $25 lower with May at $1,019 a ton.
   Livestock and pork futures were mostly lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .28 cent lower to .05 cent higher with April at
75.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .37 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with March at 79.85 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower
to .57 cent higher with April at 49.72 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .05 cent to .98 cent lower with March at 53.27 cents a
pound.

   Energy futures prices finished mostly higher in
light trading Monday in a market that appeared to be influenced by
technical factors, traders said.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, rose 37 cents to $21.79 a 42-gallon barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. May crude finished 41 cents higher at
$21.88 a barrel while June jumped 44 cents to $21.86. Later
contracts were even higher.
   Refined products traded on the New York Merc ended mixed.
Unleaded regular gasoline for delivery in March, which fell 0.40
cent to 59.85 cents a gallon Friday, fell an additional 0.02 cent
to 59.83 cents. But April rose 0.68 cent to 61.65 cents and May
rose 0.78 cent to 66.18 cents a gallon. Later contract months
jumped more.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery gained 0.75 cent to 59.05
cents a gallon, after rising 0.15 cent to 58.30 cents a gallon
Friday. April heating oil advanced 0.73 cent to 58.00 cents and May
settled at 57.18 cents, up 0.88 cent.
   Jerry Samuels, a vice president in the energy division of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said there was ``very little
fundamental news in the market.''
   ``Nothing came out concerning supply and demand ... that
seemingly would warrant a move in the upside,'' he said.
   Samuels attributed the rising prices to a variety of technical
factors and said the severe cold in the Northeast helped give
heating oil a boost.
   But Robert Baker, a senior energy analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the cold snap was forecast and already had
been figured into prices.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should examine why
government officials stood by as nation's savings and loans lost
billions of dollars, a group of free-market analysts said Monday.
   S&amp;L legislation passed last August requires the Treasury
Department to study the deposit insurance system to determine
whether it encouraged S&amp;L executives to take unwise risks.
   The report, due a year from now, is expected to form the basis
of the next attempt by Congress to reform the financial system.
   But an outline of the study fails to recognize the critical role
in the S&amp;L collapse played by elected and appointed officials, said
the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a panel of 12 experts
from universities, banks and law firms.
   Officials allowed S&amp;Ls to paper over their weaknesses with
accounting gimmicks and postponed closing S&amp;Ls when they failed,
worsening the problem and defering it to someone else's watch, the
group said in an informal position paper.
   ``The current system confronts authorities with a painful
trade-off between protecting general taxpayers' economic interests
and incurring the displeasure of politically strong regulatory
clients and their various political allies,'' the committee said.
   To counter the problem, committee members recommended that
members of Congress be required to report all efforts to win favors
for constituent firms, that estimated S&amp;L and bank losses be put
into regulatory agencies' budgets in the year they occur and that
most most of the agencies' discretion in enforcing regulations be
removed.
   On another matter, they criticized the Federal Reserve Board for
lending more than $1 billion at below market rates to ailing
commercial banks in New England.
   Such lending, from the Fed's discount window, can serve to keep
institutions afloat that should otherwise be closed, allowing
uninsured depositors to withdraw their money, the committee said.

<DATELINE>VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Piper Aircraft
Corp. said Monday it laid off 675 workers indefinitely, or close to
10 percent of its foce, and shut down its plant for two weeks.
   In addition, 550 employees at the facility will be placed on a
four-day, 32-hour work week when the plant reopens March 12. No
return date is known for the other 125 workers affected by the
shutdown.
   Joe Ponte, director of marketing, said the layoffs are the
result of a severe cash crunch and rapid expansion the past several
years. But he said the company does not plan to seek protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Piper, which laid off 450 workers last month, will keep about
425 employees on the job during the shutdown to help deal with
backlogs in aircraft deliveries, he said.
   Piper, which manufactures aircraft for general aviation, was
purchased by California investor M. Stuart Millar in 1987.
   Piper President and Chief Executive Officer Ray Johnson said
there have been discusions by Piper parent Romeo Charlie Inc. to
open an assembly plant at vacant Piper facilities in Lock Haven, Pa.
   Piper has had trouble competing with the giant Cessna Aircraft
Co., controlled by General Dynamics Corp., a defense contractor.

<HEAD>Oklahoma Mortgage Case To Be Vehicle To Settle Old Procedural
Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed Monday to use an
Oklahoma dispute over mortgage insurance to settle the question of
when a court judgment is final, a recurring procedural issue in the
federal courts.
   The justices said they will consider reinstating a suit by
FirsTier Mortgage Co. against Investors Mortgage Insurance Co.
involving eight mortgage loans on buildings in Elk City, Okla.
   FirsTier accused Investors of bad faith in failing to pay off
insurance claims.
   U.S. District Judge Luther Bohanon, sitting in Oklahoma City,
threw out the suit, announcing from the bench on Jan. 26, 1989 that
the insurance policies were void because of fraud.
   FirsTier then asked the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
overrule the judge and revive the suit.
   The appeals court said last September that the judge's oral
announcement was not a final decision and therefore the appeals
court did not have authority over the case.
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, FirsTier said the judge's
ruling from the bench disposed of all claims in the case and should
be considered a final decision.
   All that remained was for the judge to put the details in
writing, and the lack of a written opinion should not make the
appeal premature, FirsTier argued.
   The company said the 10th Circuit court ruling is in conflict
with rulings by other federal appeals courts.
   The case is FirsTier Mortgage vs. Investors Mortgage Insurance,
89-1063.

<HEAD>Leading Candidate to Oversee Thrifts Withdraws from Consideration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former congressional official who had been
the Bush administration's leading candidate to be chief regulator
of the nation's savings and loans said Monday he has withdrawn his
name from consideration.
   Frederick D. Wolf, formerly the No. 2 official at the General
Accounting Office, said he informed the Treasury Department last
week he is no longer interested in being appointed director of the
department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Wolf, a partner with the Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. accounting firm,
said in a telephone interview that Treasury officials in late
December asked him to apply for the job.
   Subsequently, administration, congressional and industry sources
said Wolf was the most likely candidate to succeed M. Danny Wall,
who announced his resignation on Dec. 4 but continues to serve.
   Wolf said he was disturbed that two months after being asked to
consider the job, Treasury officials still had not recommended his
name to the White House.
   He said he could only conclude that either the administration
did not believe it was important to fill the job soon or did not
favor his appointment.
   In the meantime, Wolf said he was forced to suspend work for
several of his firm's clients in order to avoid a potential
conflict of interest.
   The inability of the administration to decide on Wall's
replacement, nearly three months after he quit, was taken by
analysts as another sign of disarray in the management of the
savings and loan bailout.
   Last month, Daniel Kearney, alluding to differences with the
Treasury, resigned as the chief staff officer of the Resolution
Trust Corp. Oversight Board. The board sets the policy and controls
the pursestrings of the bailout.
   ``I think this withdrawal is another black eye coming on top of
Kearney's resignation,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions
analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``It is bumbling.''
   The failure to fill the post also could bolster the arguments of
members of Congress, including House Banking Committee members
Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who want to
abolish the thrift office and divide its duties among commercial
bank regulatory agencies.
   Wall, who had been under fire from Congress for his handling of
the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Irvine,
Calif., said he would like to leave the post soon.
   ``I have indicated that is my wish, but there's no date been set
at this point,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I haven't put
any deadlines down.''
   Wall said Treasury is exploring the appointment of Jonathan
Fiechter, currently the office's senior deputy director, as acting
director.
   However, in a letter to President Bush, the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions warns that the appointment could leave the
institution rudderless.
   It said its reading of last summer's S&amp;L legislation does not
leave its lawyers confident that an acting director, without Senate
confirmation, could legally close failed S&amp;Ls, issue rules or
exercise the other powers of the director's office.
   Art Siddon, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, had no
comment on the trade group's contention.

   MCorp, the remains of what was once
Texas's second-largest bank holding company, said it had agreed to
sell its largest bank, 109-year-old MBank-El Paso, to investors
headed by the bank's local officers.
   ``If this sale is successful, the investor group fully intends
to pursue local communitywide investment and to insure ownership
and operations based at the local level,'' said Henry Ellis,
president of MBank-El Paso.
   Ellis would not name the sale price or the investors, but H.M.
Daugherty, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said he and
Ellis are principal investors.
   MBank-El Paso was one of five banks MCorp kept after the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. stripped the bank holding company of 20
Texas banking subsidiaries last year after MCorp filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection.
   Those 20 banks were bought by Banc One Corp., an Ohio banking
company, and now operate as Bank One-Texas.
   The agreement calls for MCorp to receive an undisclosed amount
of cash and turn over all the issued and outstanding stock of
MBank-El Paso to the investor group.
   Dallas-based MCorp said specifics of the deal would be set forth
in filings with the federal bankruptcy court, which must approve
the sale along with bank regulators. The sale is expected to be
completed before Sept. 30.
   MBank-El Paso has assets of $1.1 billion and deposits totaling
about $946 million.
   MBank has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since March
31, 1989. MCorp's federally assisted bailout in 1989 was the third
largest in history after Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984
and FirstRepublic Bank Corp. of Dallas in 1988.
   MBank-El Paso has 600 employees, including those in its eight
branches in the city.
   Tom Hudgins, MCorp group chairman, said the holding company also
is trying to sell its four remaining banks in Waco, New Braunfels,
Corpus Christi and Brownsville.
   MCorp already has agreed to sell MVestment Corp., a trust and
investment subsidiary, to Ameritrust Corp. in a deal awaiting
federal regulatory approval.

<HEAD>Consumers Less Confident About Future, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. consumers are more positive about current
economic conditions but are less confident about the future than
they were in January, according to a survey released Monday.
   The Conference Board's monthly survey on consumer confidence
also showed consumers' buying plans mixed. The business research
group said its consumer confidence index for February is 105.4,
down 1 point from January.
   Nearly 25 percent of the respondents said current business
conditions are good, up from 23 percent in January. In looking
ahead to the next six months, however, more consumers than
previously said they fear the general business climate will worsen.
   Respondents also are increasingly apprehensive about job
prospects, the Conference Board said.
   The number of people who expect their incomes to rise in the
near future was down three percentage points at 25.6 percent, the
survey of 5,000 U.S. households showed.
   ``Although the overall measure of consumer confidence did not
change much in February, the consumer's increasing ambivalence
about the immediate future is of some concern,'' said Fabian
Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer Research Center.
   ``It is still difficult to account for the consumer's growing
uneasiness, but apprehension about jobs appears to be a major
factor.''
   Consumers' plans to buy a car, which had improved in the surveys
for December and January, were largely unchanged in February at 7.6
percent, the poll showed. Homebuying intentions increased to 3.9
percent from 3.6 percent. Plans to purchase a major appliance
declined slightly, however.

<HEAD>K mart to Charge $640 M Against 1989 Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. said Monday it would take a
charge of $640 million against 1989 earnings to cover the costs of
a $2.3-billion program to modernize the nation's second-largest
retail chain.
   The discount retailer said it plans to close 30 of its 2,194
stores, modernize or expand other stores and open new about 250 new
K marts during the five-year program, spokesman Orren Knauer said.
   The company in November reported a 17.5-percent drop in third
quarter profits to $104.1 million. It blamed the decline from the
year-earlier quarter on price cuts made to improve the company's
market share.
   Knauer declined to estimate K mart's 1989 earnings. But analysts
with Seidler-Amdec Securities Inc. of Los Angeles, Calif.,
predicted K mart profits would be about $730 million before the
charge. In 1988, K mart earned $803 million.
   ``K mart is taking a far more aggressive approach to modernize
their stores than they were planning before,'' said Tom Tashjian,
associate director of Seidler-Amdec. ``The Wal-mart and Target
chains are clearly better at merchandise presentation than K mart
at this time.''
   ``K mart is going to get it done quickly to keep a solid market
share and keep themselves in a competitive position,'' Tashjian
said.
   But Knauer said K mart's decision, which affects all but three
of its U.S. stores, wasn't a reaction to competition.
   ``We made the decision because of internal factors,'' Knauer
said, citing an 18-month pilot project during which several stores
were renovated or moved.
   ``It was based on Christmas sales and the success of stores
where we've already made changes.
   ``In the enlarged, relocated and prototyped stores, customer
acceptance of the layouts, fixturing and new merchandise
assortments has been very good, and sales results have exceeded
expectations,'' he said.
   The program also includes moving about 280 stores, Knauer said.
   ``The population base may have shifted. If so, we'll find
property closer to the existing population base,'' he said.
   K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini said in a statement that the
store enlargements and relocations should be completed by 1993, and
other refurbishments will be done by 1994.
   Tashjian said K mart's profitability began lagging behind
Wal-mart and Target because the latter companies expanded more
recently.
   ``All the companies are about 25 years old, but K mart's
expansion was early on in that period,'' Tashjian said. ``The
others have expanded during the latter part of the 25 years so they
have younger, better-looking stores. Target is much more fun to
shop in.''
   K mart has 4,171 outlets in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada,
including 2,288 K mart stores, 1,258 Waldenbooks, 141 Builders
Square and 282 Pay Less Drug stores. The Troy-based company also
purchased PACE Membership Warehouse Inc. for $322 million late last
year.
   The three stores that won't be affected by the program are newly
built outlets in Oak Park, Mich., and Virginia Beach, Va., and a
refurbished store in Rochester, Mich.

<HEAD>Conrail Buys Back $1 Billion In Shares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail said it had bought back 22.32
million of its shares _ about one third of its outstanding common
stock _ at $49 a share or a total of over $1 billion.
   Under a previously announced ``dutch auction,'' Conrail invited
shareholders to tender their shares at a price between $43 and $53.
The cash tender offer expired at midnight Feb. 14.
   The next day, Conrail announced it would repurchase shares
delivered at or below $49.
   The Philadelphia-based freight railroad said Monday the exact
number of shares it was buying was 22.32 million. Conrail said it
began paying for the shares Monday.
   The repurchase is part of a financial restructuring announced
last month intended in part to increase Conrail's stock price to
help ward off any unwanted takeover attempts.
   On April 3, a 10 percent limitation on ownership of Conrail's
stock will be lifted under the terms of the Conrail Privatization
Act of 1986, the law under which the government privatized the
company.
   Conrail stock closed at $1.25 higher Monday at $45.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The stock closed at $46.125 on Jan.17, the day
the restructuring plan was announced.

<HEAD>New President Named for Cox Broadcasting Division</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nicholas D. Trigony has been named president of
the broadcasting division of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc.
   The 49-year-old Trigony will succeed Stanley G. Mouse, 68, when
he retires on Wednesday, Cox Enterprises said in a statement Monday.
   Trigony is executive vice president for the division, which is
responsible for Cox' seven television stations, five AM and seven
FM radio stations, as well as TeleRep, a national television sales
representation firm.
   Mouse joined the company in 1945 as an announcement and
promotion director at WHIO-AM in Dayton, the first broadcasting
property of the company's founder, the late Gov. James M. Cox of
Ohio. In 1969, Mouse was elected a corporate vice president of Cox
Communications Inc., a public company that later merged with the
private Cox Enterprises.
   He became president of the broadcasting division in 1987.
   Cox Enterprises also owns newspapers, including The Atlanta
Journal and Constitution, and cable television stations.

<HEAD>New Money Delayed for International Monetary Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and other leading countries
have failed to agree on providing billions of dollars to the
International Monetary Fund for lending to the Third World and
eastern Europe.
   The fund said Monday it has put off a decision on new funding
until the end of June in yet another setback for the agency.
   The deadline had been set for March 31 after repeated
postponements. That date would have represented a two-year delay
over the normal timetable for reviewing fund resources. Decisions
normally are taken every five years.
   Poland has recently won a $730 million loan from the fund and
approval is reported to be near on a $213 million loan for Hungary.
   Though small in comparison with the borrowing needs of eastern
Europe, these loans are important in opening the way to lending by
others. Governments and commercial banks take confidence from the
strict economic measures that the fund requires countries to put in
place before it lends money.
   Resources of the fund amount to the equivalent of $117 billion,
but much of that is in currencies of Third World countries and is
not in demand by borrowers.
   Managing Director Michel Camdessus has asked that the total be
doubled. Although he had widespread support among the 152 member
governments, the United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia demurred.
   The United States has been reported ready for a 50 percent
increase. That would require it to put up nearly $12 billion as the
largest source of the fund's money. The outlays would not count in
the U.S. budget because the money is considered still the property
of the United States, which receives interest on dollars that the
fund lends out.
   The United States itself could borrow other countries' currency,
as it has in the past.
   Japan raised a problem when it asked to be the number two
contributor instead of number five. Officials said this issue had
been virtually settled, with West Germany as number three, though
the relative positions of Britain and France are not yet clear.
   The officials, who spoke on condition they not be named, said
the U.S. Treasury is concerned about overdue payments to the fund
from 11 Third World countries, which have reached nearly $4.8
billion. The fund has set up special arrangements for loans to the
poorest countries on easier terms, but those which have not brought
their accounts up to date are not eligible to not take advantage of
the offer.
   Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford has been asked to
testify Thursday on the fund before a panel of Congressmen, the
subcommittee on international development, finance, trade and
monetary policy of the Banking Committee in the House of
Representatives.
