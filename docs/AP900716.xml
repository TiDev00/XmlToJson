   About 2,000 people were urged to leave their
homes Monday after authorities found a liquid they thought was
nitroglycerin in a house where officers earlier responded to a
domestic dispute.
   Authorities also evacuated residents along a three-mile route
where a truck would carry the material out of this western Ohio
city of 20,000 people.
   Michael Hemm, public information officer for the city, said FBI
tests indicated that the substance in the two 16-ounce soft-drink
bottles could be nitroglycerin.
   ``The slightest friction, such as the removal of a cap, can
detonate it,'' Hemm said.
   Police arrested an occupant of the home, Dana Taylor, 25, and
charged him with possession of a dangerous ordnance, Hemm said.
Taylor, whom police said had experimented with explosives before,
was held Monday in the Miami County jail.
   About 2,000 residents in 500 homes were urged to leave the area,
said Police Chief Donald White. Officials weren't able to say how
many actually left, but the evacuation area appeared empty.
   About 100 people in this town 30 miles north of Dayton ended up
at an evacuation center at an elementary school, said Lucy Fess,
executive director of the Miami Valley chapter of the American Red
Cross.
   Hemm said FBI agents tested a syringe and shot glass containing
sawdust in the basement. Both tested positive for nitroglycerin. He
said, however, the tests are not foolproof.
   He said some flammable materials were removed from the house in
the afternoon, but the substance suspected of being nitroglycerin
remained.
   Safety officials planned to use a dump truck filled with sand to
take the chemical to a gravel pit outside of the city.
   Brad Leffel, 32, a neighbor, said police arrived at Taylor's
house shortly after midnight, talked with him and entered the house
after he left.
   About seven hours later, Leffel said police came to his door and
told him the neighborhood was being evacuated because of some
explosive chemicals nearby.
   ``I had no idea it was next door,'' Leffel said. ``I took my
time. It's got me thinking.''

<HEAD>Branch Ends Flap Over Mural's Offending Fannies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The flap over an Adam-and-Eve-style motel
mural has ended with the artist painting a branch over a pair of
naked backsides that offended the city's mayor.
   But artist Steve Kroeger had the last laugh Sunday as he touched
up the mural at the Sunray Lodge Motel.
   Since city officials had also asked for children to be added in
keeping with Hollywood's family image, Kroeger obliged by painting
one in _ the Coppertone girl, bare derriere and all.
   The controversy began Thursday when Mayor Sal Oliveri asked that
the bare bottoms of the adults be covered because it was offensive.
The 8-foot-tall by 24-foot-long mural showed a rear view of a
couple seated on a deserted beach and gazing into each other's eyes.
   Oliveri said later he found nothing offensive about the bare
bottom of the Coppertone girl, which is displayed on a billboard
eight blocks away.
   Kroeger, 34, originally refused to change the mural.
   ``Would they have put bathing suits on a Rubens?'' he asked last
week.
   But the artist said he added the branches and little girl to
address the city's concerns, and to avoid trouble for motel owner
Doris Ouellet.
   ``I am just complying with city officials,'' he said. ``They
requested a child and a dog and that's what they got.''
   Ms. Ouellet, the owner of the motel, laughed when she saw Little
Miss Coppertone.
   ``I like it,'' she said. ``I didn't know he was going to put
that in the picture. I don't think it's offensive.''
   Ms. Ouellet said she had received about 50 calls in favor of the
original mural, with only two residents agreeing with the mayor
that it should be toned down.
   Oliveri said Sunday he was pleased that Kroeger had cooperated.
   ``This is very interesting. ... He took a nude mural and put a
child in it. It changes the flavor in it a bit. It seems he is
cooperating, what can I say?''

   A woman was carried Monday from the site
of the motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was killed, but she moved
her two-year protest against construction at the motel all of 50
feet.
   Two femal sheriff's deputies, enforcing a court order, lifted
Jacqueline Smith from a lawn chair and hauled her, unresisting,
across the street.
   She had refused to leave her makeshift camp in front a
construction site at The Lorraine Motel, which was shut down in
January 1988 to make way for a museum called the National Civil
Rights Center. She has camped in front of The Lorraine since
deputies evicted her from the motel itself on March 2, 1988.
   Ms. Smith, 39, contends The Lorraine should be used as housing
for the homeless, as a medical clinic or for some other such
purpose.
   ``This protest must continue,'' she said after pitching her tent
anew on a sidewalk across the street from the construction site.
   A half-dozen sheriff's deputies waded through about 50 gawkers,
news reporters and supporters of Ms. Smith to pluck her from her
camp. She didn't resist.
   Tom Marshall, a deputy chief with the Shelby County Sheriff's
Department, said the court order required only that she leave the
construction site.
   Construction workers moved her tent and other belongings into
the street and closed in a chain-link fence behind her.
   Shortly after the eviction, Ms. Smith restablished her camp but
on the opposite side of the small side street.
   ``They've torn it up. Look at it,'' she said of the motel. ``It
won't be The Lorraine Motel again.''
   Museum developers say the wing of the motel where King was shot
will be restored to the way it looked when he was assassinated
April 4, 1968. The museum will center on that wing. Much of The
Lorraine has been demolished.
   The court order to move Ms. Smith was issued Friday after the
construction manager for the museum said she was in the way.
   Until then, museum developers had pretty much ignored her. City
police have made no attempt to move her.
   Police spokesman John Bennett said that has been considered the
state's responsibility since the museum project is under state
supervision.
   State officials bumped the responsibility for moving Ms. Smith
to the construction company.
   The Lorraine was crumbling in disrepair in 1982 when a group of
concerned citizens raised $140,000 to buy it at a foreclosure
auction.
   The group, called The Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation,
spent the next several years persuading the state, county and city
governments to build the museum.

<HEAD>Poland's Border on Paris Agenda</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allaying Polish concerns about German
unification is the main goal of seven-nation talks involving
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Paris on Tuesday.
   The long-scheduled event also gives Baker a chance hear from
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on the Communist
Party shakeup in Moscow.
   Baker, flying to Paris today, will swap information with
Shevardnadze on the back-to-back NATO and economic summits held by
Western allies in London and Houston.
   The talks in Paris were set up to give Polish Foreign Minister
Krysztof Skubiszeski a chance to pitch directly for territorial
guarantees when the two Germanies are unified.
   He will take the seventh seat at the table with Baker,
Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, West
Germany and East Germany.
   Baker's top aides do not expect any major breakthroughs during
his 41-hour stay in the French capital.
   The Soviet leadership is still settling down from a busy party
congress that kept President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from spending a
lot of time reflecting on global issues.
   ``I don't expect a large degree of movement in any area,'' a
senior U.S. official said Friday. ``My sense is that the Soviets
will not be difficult on Germany but that the talks will not reveal
any major moves on their part.''
   The official, who insisted on anonymity, described the Kremlin
as ``totally preoccupied'' by the party congress.
   At two earlier rounds on Germany in Bonn and Berlin, the Soviets
tried at first to slow down unification and then to put limits on
the merged Germany's military might.
   The United States, Britain, France and West Germany resisted.
   But the NATO summit meeting two weeks ago in London gave Moscow
a partial victory. East-West talks on German forces are to begin
immediately after NATO and the Warsaw Pact complete a treaty to
reduce U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe.
   Invaded and nearly extinguished by Germany in World War II,
Poland wound up after the Allies' victory with some German lands to
compensate for territory seized by the Soviet Union, their other
historic adversary.
   Now Poles wants to be sure the merger of East and West Germany
will not inspire the Germans to try to spread into their country
again.
   Leaders of the two Germanys have promised Poland a border treaty
after unification. But the Poles are reluctant to see the four
allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _
withdraw from control of Berlin until the treaty is concluded.
   Markus Meckel, the East German foreign minister, saw Baker
Friday at the State Department. He told reporters afterward that
``the future Germany will have good relations with countries in the
East.''
   Moreover, Meckel said, German unification and a border treaty
with Poland should be finished at about the same time, in January.
   The NATO summit did a lot more to ease East-West tensions than
just set up negotiations on German forces.
   A quarter century of military doctrine was revised to make the
use of nuclear weapons against the Soviets a highly unlikely last
resort.
   And Gorbachev was invited to attend the North Atlantic Council
meeting in Brussels in December.
   ``My impression is that Shevardnadze will be very pleased coming
into this meeting with Baker because of the NATO summit,'' the
senior official told The Associated Press. ``He will demonstrate
good will and appreciation.''

<HEAD>Quake Prediction Shakes Up Residents Along New Madrid Fault</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Madrid is pronounced MAD-rid.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist's prediction that a quake might strike Missouri and
neighboring states Dec. 2 appears to have shaken loose the seismic
fears of people in the nation's heartland.
   The prediction by climatologist Iben Browning _ who claims to
have forecast the Oct. 17 Bay area quake but whose theories are
disputed by most seismologists _ has not created a panic.
   But along the New Madrid fault, the example of the Northern
California quake, coupled with Browning's forecast, has raised
awareness of earthquakes and earthquake safety.
   Insurance sales are up, a school district has tentatively
canceled classes and two states' National Guards have scheduled
drills that week.
   The fault, which roughly follows the Mississippi River from
Mississippi to Illinois, may not be as well known as the San
Andreas fault in California, but it commands respect among
earthquake experts.
   The last sizable quake on the fault was in 1895, but that's not
the one people talk about. The Big One _ actually, the Big Three or
Four _ occurred in 1811 and 1812, when a series of quakes centered
in New Madrid, Mo., rocked much of the eastern half of the nation.
   The quakes rang church bells in Washington, D.C., and are said
to have made the Mississippi River run backard. They have been
estimated at around 8 on the Richter scale.
   The quakes have become part of the folklore of the region _
``It's Our Fault,'' a T-shirt proclaims. But until recently, that
was about as far as it went.
   ``We talked about it for years,'' said Sheriff Jake Rone of New
Madrid County, ``but we never really got serious about it until
this thing happened.''
   The thing that has people talking up and down the New Madrid
fault is a projection by Browning, a scientist from Tijeras, N.M.,
that there could be a major quake in the region Dec. 2 or 3.
   Browning, 72, an inventor and climate consultant, bases his
projection on a convergence of tidal forces, which he believes can
put stress on earthquake faults. But he stresses it's a
possibility, not a certainty, that such a quake will happen.
   Still, he claims to have predicted last October's California
quake using the same method _ he says he warned a group of
executives in San Francisco seven days before the quake.
   Despite the disdain of seismologists, a school district in
Mississippi County, Ark., has tentatively canceled classes Dec. 3-4.
   Insurance agents in Arkansas say their business in quake
insurance policies picked up noticeably after the California
temblor and dramatically after word of Browning's projection became
public in March.
   The director of Indiana's Emergency Management Agency doesn't
necessarily believe the forecast, but he doesn't disbelieve it
either.
   ``I basically have taken the position we are not going to ignore
this prediction,'' Jerry Hauer said.
   Hauer also is chairman of the Central United States Earthquake
Consortium, which includes emergency management directors from the
states that would be hardest hit by a New Madrid quake _ Arkansas,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee.
   The consortium has taken no action to prepare for a December
quake, and Hauer said Browning probably will be proved wrong.
   But just in case he isn't, Hauer said, ``If we have to schedule
National Guard drills during the month of December, why not
schedule them that week?''
   Officials in Missouri and Arkansas have already done just that,
both planning earthquake drills for guardsmen in the first few days
of December.
   ``If something does happen, we'll be there,'' said Arkansas
Guard spokeswoman Maj. Cissy Lashbrook. ``If nothing happens,
people will see we're prepared for this type of emergency.''
   Seismologists have mixed feelings about Browning's forecast.
It's not that they don't believe there will be a quake; they just
don't believe it can be forecast as specifically as Browning
suggests.
   As close as seismologists can pinpoint it, there's a 40 percent
to 63 percent chance of a severe quake _ one that is magnitude 6 on
the Richter scale _ on the New Madrid fault in the next 15 years.
   ``Yes, people ought to be prepared,'' said Klaus Jacob, a senior
research scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory in Palisades, N.Y. ``They should be prepared
on Dec. 3 and 4. But they should also be prepared today and
tomorrow, and Dec. 1 and next year.''
   ``Earthquakes don't care about predictions,'' he said. ``And
people shouldn't worry about predictions; they should worry about
earthquakes.''

<HEAD>71-Year-Old Conductor Cancels Performances, Cites Exhaustion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several
performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and
will return to the United States to recover, his manager announced
today.
   ``Leonard Bernstein is suffering from exhaustion as a result of
trying to fulfill his professional obligations while not having
fully recovered from several ailments he suffered this spring.
Complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable
man is to regain his usual high energy level,'' said Dr. Kevin
Cahill, the conductor's personal physician.
   Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and
pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a
statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernstein's manager.
   Dr. Angelo Aquista, an associate of Cahill, flew to Japan to
accompany the conductor back to New York, it said. Kraut did not
provide the time or date of Bernstein's departure.
   Bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the London Symphony
Orchestra in four performances in Japan, ending with a concert on
July 22.
   Bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans
and sponsors and saying that he had asked LSO principal conductor
Michael Tilson Thomas and Japanese conductor Eiji Oue to fulfill
his conducting responsibilities.
   On Saturday and Sunday, Bernstein canceled appearances with an
orchestra of young musicians from the Pacific-Asia region who had
been training under principals of the LSO during the three-week
Pacific Music Festival in northern Japan.
   Bernstein inaugurated the festival last month. He started the
event along the lines of the Tanglewood music festival in
Massachusetts, where young musicians train with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
   The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia
where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
   Kraut's statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would
be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during
the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this
summer.

<HEAD>Democrat-Led Group Pushing for Changes in Electoral College</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drive to change the way Americans elect
their presidents is being pushed by a group that acknowledges
Democrats stand to gain the most _ at least at first _ from
tinkering with the Electoral College.
   The year-old Electoral Fairness Project, led by a Democrat, is
trying to persuade states to abandon the winner-take-all method of
doling out Electoral College votes to presidential candidates.
   The system has been nearly universal since 1836. But critics say
it does not accurately reflect the popular vote and prompts
candidates to avoid entire states they feel they can't win.
   Lately, the system has favored Republicans.
   ``In state after state, the voters are essentially written off
by the numbers. People don't see the candidates, don't get a sense
of what's going on,'' said Linda Tarr-Whelan, a board member of the
Electoral Fairness Project.
   She said the changes advocated by the group ``would get people
much more involved and would require candidates to look at
virtually all the states and congressional districts at one time or
another as they plan out their strategy.''
   The Constitution determines how many electoral votes each state
gets: one for each of its two senators and for each of its U.S.
House members. How states divide up those votes is not dictated by
the Constitution, but virtually all states award all their
electoral votes to the candidate who wins the statewide popular
vote.
   The fairness project wants other states to do what Maine did in
1969: give presidential candidates one electoral vote for each
House district in which they win the popular vote, with the other
two votes going to the winner of the statewide popular vote.
   The fairness project, run by Democrat Skip Roberts, admits its
primary objective is to break the GOP lock on electoral votes in
the South and parts of the Midwest.
   Some Republicans proposed the same changes 30 years ago when the
GOP would have reaped the most benefit. But this year, state and
national Republican leaders are heaping scorn on the tactic.
   ``The Democrats are resorting to gimmicks because they can't win
on the strength of their ideas,'' said Ben Ginsberg, chief counsel
to the Republican National Committee.
   Roberts denies he is promoting a gimmick. ``This is not a trick.
You still need a nominee and a coherent campaign,'' he said.
   The Connecticut House adopted the fairness project's proposal
this session but it died in the state Senate. In North Carolina,
where the Republican governor has no veto, the House has passed the
plan and the Democratic-controlled Senate was scheduled to vote
today.
   Roberts still hopes that legislatures in Connecticut, New
Jersey, Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia and Indiana will revise their
electoral systems before 1992, when the impact of the changes can
be tested.
   Curtis Gans, director of the non-partisan Committee for the
Study of the American Electorate, contends the changes would
generate major improvements affecting both parties.
   Gans said the revised electoral system would stimulate more
grassroots campaigning and less reliance on ``demagogic media
appeals'' and ``unaccountable political consultants.'' It also
would produce an Electoral College vote that more closely reflects
the popular vote, he said.
   Few political scientists are as enthusiastic, nor do they see it
being embraced in many states. Many say its virtues are subtle at
best _ it is slightly more democratic and might put a few more
states on the presidential campaign trail.
   Larry Sabato, an analyst at the University of Virginia, said the
district-by-district allocation of electoral votes might even
discourage candidates from visiting certain states.
   Contenders often write off states whose electoral vote total is
insignificant, Sabato said. Parceling out those votes by
congressional district ``would give even less of an incentive to
come,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Sabato said he supports the change because it
would lessen the likelihood of an Electoral College victory by a
candidate who had received a minority of the popular vote. That
almost happened in 1976, when Jimmy Carter defeated Gerald Ford,
and did happen three times between 1824 and 1888, he said.
   ``It would be a disaster today. I think people would take to the
streets,'' Sabato said.
   That kind of emotion does not characterize the current debate.
``People just regard this as a woodwork issue,'' said Bruce
Buchanan, a government professor at the University of Texas. ``It's
way off the center of the plate.''

<HEAD>No Criminal Evidence Against Neil Bush, Thornburgh Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has no information that
Neil Bush broke any criminal law as a director of a failed savings
and loan, but it would pursue the case if such an allegation were
made, the attorney general says.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh spoke Sunday as Rep. Patricia
Schroeder, D-Colo., vowed to continue seeking an independent
counsel to investigate the Denver-based Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association.
   Neil Bush, one of President Bush's four sons, was a director of
the institution, which failed at a loss of $1 billion.
   Thornburgh disagreed with Mrs. Schroeder on the need for an
independent counsel.
   ``I don't think it would be fair to anyone, any citizen of the
United States to appoint an independent counsel or special
prosecutor where there are no allegations of criminal misconduct,''
he said on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Meanwhile, FDIC Chairman William Seidman said the insurance fund
for deposits in banks and savings and loans is under ``considerable
stress,'' but it's unlikely it will collapse the way the savings
and loan system did.
   ``The banks will not be like the S&amp;Ls,'' Seidman said on CBS's
``Face the Nation.'' But he said, ``I think we have to be very
careful the way we handle deposit insurance, and we have to be very
careful that we maintain the stability of the system.''
   Also, the Office of Thrift Supervision is planning to change the
way it releases financial data to the public, and some analysts
accuse the agency of using ``spin control'' to cut down on the bad
news.
   The agency plans to report only on solvent, privately owned
savings institutions. Information on failed but still-operating
thrifts controlled by the government will be reported later by a
separate agency, the Resolution Trust Corp.
   The S&amp;L fiasco has spawned bitter partisan wrangling over who
caused the crisis and how it is going to be fixed. Republicans
charge Democrats in Congress led the legislative efforts that
resulted in abuses; Democrats say the Republican administrations
failed to supervise the system.
   Neil Bush has become a symbol in the burgeoning crisis, expected
to cost taxpayers $500 billion, or $2,500 per person.
   Thornburgh said information turned up in other investigations of
Neil Bush's role as a director of Silverado might be turned over to
the Justice Department.
   So far, ``Nothing has been brought to our attention that
indicates criminal activity,'' he said. ``Let me assure you,
however, that in this case as in any other that if there are
credible allegations of criminal wrongdoing, we will pursue them.''
   To make a request for an independent counsel, Schroeder must
obtain signatures from 12 Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee. She was one signature short on Friday, but she said on
CBS she still believes an independent counsel is warranted.
   Neil Bush has been charged by thrift regulators with violating
conflict-of-interest rules for, in one case, accepting a loan from
a businessmen who later received a $900,000 line of credit from
Silverado. Bush has denied doing anything wrong and will appear at
an administrative hearing in September to defend himself.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. also is investigating the
failure of Silverado to determine whether Neil Bush and other
directors acted properly. Charges could be filed against Bush if
the FDIC determines there was negligence.
   The OTS' plan to change the way it reports data on S&amp;Ls is
drawing criticism from some analysts.
   ``By just reporting data on the healthy part of the industry ...
(regulators) can report a number that says the thrift industry is
earning money, when it isn't. It's spin control,'' said Robert
Litan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank.
   Also, statistics on deposits and withdrawals at thrift
institutions, previously released monthly, will be put out
quarterly.
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Bert Ely, a financial
institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va. ``Here we have an industry
... turning into one of the worst financial disasters ever and a
key agency says it's going to make it harder to figure out what's
going on.''
   The thrift office will relay financial information on the failed
thrifts to the RTC, which manages those institutions until they can
be sold or closed.
   ``It's more appropriate for the RTC to put out information on
conservatorship institutions because they are the conservator,''
said thrift office Director Timothy Ryan.

<TEXT>
   Two of the nation's largest farm lobbying
groups are giving widely divergent pictures of American farming if
President Bush prevails in his quest to eliminate all
trade-distorting crop subsidies.
   For the National Farmers' Union, an end to subsidies would turn
back the clock to the Depression, where farmers were whipsawed by
boom-bust cycles of overproduction and shortages.
   But the American Farm Bureau Federation has a less apocalyptic
view, believing U.S. farmers will be able to adapt to a
subsidy-free global market.
   Last week's economic summit in Houston produced an agreement of
sorts that White House officials hope will breathe new life into
the ongoing Uruguay Round trade talks in Geneva.
   The United States wants the 97-member General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade to eliminate export subsidies on agricultural
products and to start winding down internal farm subsidies on food
production.
   But U.S. officials insist there will be no unilateral scuttling
of farm programs. And Bush made it clear that he will not ask
Congress to dismantle U.S. farm subsidies unless other countries do
likewise.
   Spending for commodity programs under the 1985 farm law, which
expires this year, is estimated at $79.4 billion over five years.
The cost of the 1990 farm bill is projected at about $55 billion.
   The National Farmers' Union supports the U.S. proposal for
eliminating export subsidies, spokesman Bob Denman said. Export
subsidies are paid so that one country's commodities can have a
price edge on those of another.
   The 12-nation European Community is a major user of export
subsidies for agricultural products, and the United States in
recent years has retaliated with subsidies of its own, called the
Export Enhancement Program.
   Aside from that, the NFU is wary about trading away the
traditional U.S. price supports for wheat, corn, cotton, rice, milk
and other products.
   ``Without domestic farm programs _ the programs the president
wants ended _ I predict a return to Depression-era supply and price
cycles, massive overproduction and waste of foodstuffs,'' says NFU
president Leland Swenson.
   Don Lipton, a spokesman for the American Farm Bureau Federation,
has a milder view.
   ``We think we will continue to have a safety net'' of price
supports, Lipton said. But pressed to comment on the possibility of
all being phased out, he said American farmers are competitive
enough to survive and do well.
   ``They will flourish in competing for new markets,'' Lipton
said. ``In a few areas, we might have some problems, but there'll
be enough time to make adjustments to become competitive.''
   Most American farmers, he said, realize that they should be
assuming more of the risks of production and not rely so much on
the government.
   ``Yet, in the 1990 farm bill, it's clear that there's not going
to be any great shift in that direction in the near term,'' Lipton
said.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said the Houston agreement
reaffirmed a goal of long-term agricultural policy reform and
emphasized the Uruguay Round as a step in that direction.
   There was an intent expressed in Houston to reduce each
country's farm supports ``which have a tendency'' to stimulate
excess production, he said.
   Yeutter said another objective is to have ``specific
negotiations'' on reducing and, hopefully, phasing out export
subsidies throughout the world.
   A third objective is to open trade doors. The Houston agreement,
Yeutter said, contained ``considerable language'' that tells the
world the Uruguay Round of trade talks is important and that time
is running out.
   But phasing out domestic price supports, even if the other GATT
countries agree to do the same?
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, thinks it's a pipe
dream.
   ``We may be in an era of somewhat reduced international export
subsidies,'' Glickman said. ``But it's pie in the sky to say we're
going to eliminate domestic subsidies. I just don't think that's
going to happen. The cycle of history is kind of immutable.''
   Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee, said after listening to Bush last week that it
would be hard to sell the idea on Capitol Hill.
   ``If you follow the history of farm price supports in this
country, it's been very difficult to conclude anything except that
farm subsidies will live forever,'' Fascell said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., a former agriculture
committee chairman, said the Europeans have ``great reluctance'' to
dismantle farm subsidies. And those, he said, go far beyond the
U.S. programs.
   One of the U.S. criticisms of the European agricultural
structure is that there are far too many small, mom and pop farms,
and subsidies have been designed to preserve them.
   In the United States, farm programs have been keyed to
production since their roots were set in the early 1930s.
   As a result, the larger a farm is, the more it produces, the
larger the subsidies. In 1988, for example, about 633,000 farms
received federal subsidy payments averaging $14,257 each, according
to the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   More than 70 percent of the total payments in 1988 went to farms
that grossed more than $100,000 a year. That included 13.6 percent
of the total to 21,701 farmers whose annual sales were $500,000 or
more, an average of $56,571 each.
   By comparison, 159,691 farms averaged $10,917 each, making up
less than 20 percent of the year's subsidy payments.
   Advocates of targeting payments to smaller farmers are aiming at
further action when 1990 farm legislation comes up for floor debate
in the House the week of July 23.
   The charge is led by Reps. Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., who want to eliminate subsidies to any producer
with income over $100,000 a year, or with gross sales of more than
$500,000.

   Bereft of its empire and wrestling with the
prospect of a reunited Germany dominating Europe, Britain has once
again become embroiled in a dispute over its commitment to European
political and economic union.
   It's an issue that has caused four Cabinet ministers to leave
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government in four years _ and
is expected to dominate British politics through the 1990s.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's opposition to European
political and economic union is well-known, especially now that
Germany is uniting.
   Thus when Nicholas Ridley, her ideological soulmate and closest
Cabinet colleague, launched a diatribe against the Germans and the
European Community bureaucracy, it provoked new questions about
Mrs. Thatcher's true feelings.
   In an interview in last week's Spectator magazine, Ridley
accused Germany of seeking to dominate a federal Europe, called
France ``a poodle'' of West Germany and said that surrendering
British sovereignty to unelected European Community politicians was
tantamount to giving it to Hitler.
   Facing a chorus of disapproval from the opposition as well as
his own Conservative Party, Ridley resigned as trade secretary on
Saturday.
   On Sunday it emerged that Mrs. Thatcher called a meeting of
leading academics in March to discuss Germany. The talk touched,
among other things, on German stereotypes like bullying, egotism
and sentimentality.
   It was a further embarrassment to a government already on the
defensive over Ridley's remarks.
   Polls in several Sunday papers found about half of all Britons
disagreeing with Ridley _ 53 percent in The Sunday Telegraph poll,
52 percent in The Sunday Correspondent and 48 percent in The Sunday
Times.
   The Independent on Sunday published the leaked text of a summary
of the academics' meeting, written by Charles Powell, Mrs.
Thatcher's private secretary. This guaranteed that the issue of
Europe would remain on top of the national agenda.
   The summary of the March 24 meeting at Mrs. Thatcher's country
home said ``even the optimists had some unease, not for the present
and the immediate future, but for what might lie further down the
road than we can yet see.''
   Mrs. Thatcher's think tank concluded that while the Germans have
changed, the future was uncertain. Meanwhile, they decided, ``we
should be nice to the Germans.''
   But the summary said the way Germans ``threw their weight about
in the European Community suggested that a lot had still not
changed ... German behavior in the EC _ `we pay so we must have our
way' _ was seen by some as a harbinger of Germany's economic
dominance over Western Europe.''
   The report of the brainstorming session drew swift criticism
from opposition politicians.
   Gerald Kaufman of the opposition Labor Party attacked ``the
uncouthness and insensitivity'' of senior government members
sitting around ``pulling the Germans to pieces.''
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Liberal Democrats, said:
``Mrs. Thatcher is now irreparably damaged in her ability to
represent Britain in Europe and to play a full and constructive
part in the creation of a new Europe.''
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who confirmed the accuracy of
the summary, defended the meeting in a BBC-TV interview as a
natural response to the questions posed by the upheaval in Eastern
Europe.
   Arguments about Britain's commitment to the European Community
have bedeviled Mrs. Thatcher's Cabinet in recent years.
   Michael Heseltine quit as defense secretary in 1986 after losing
a battle over the sale of an ailing British helicopter
manufacturer. Heseltine favored selling it to a European
consortium. Mrs. Thatcher preferred an American buyer.
   Heseltine's resignation forced Home Secretary Leon Brittan to
quit.
   The long-running argument about Britain's entry into the
arrangement that acts to stabilize European Community currencies _
the Exchange Rate Mechanism _ was in the background of another
upheaval last year.
   Geoffrey Howe, then foreign secretary and a supporter of the
mechanism, was demoted. Months later Nigel Lawson resigned as
Treasury chief in a dispute linked to it.
   Britain's entry into the currency arrangement now looks
inevitable, but a whole new issue has loomed _ the uniting of the
12 European Community nations under a single currency and central
bank.
   Economic union, combined with a lifting of border controls and
tariffs, is planned for Jan. 1, 1993 and Mrs. Thatcher loathes the
idea, seeing it as the end of Britain's sovereignty over its
economic affairs.
   These are complex financial affairs, above the heads of many
Britons. But Ridley's blunt remarks in the Spectator interview
about monetary union being ``all a German racket designed to take
over the whole of Europe'' were much more readily understandable.
   They ensure that Europe, as a British political issue, will run
and run.

   Jane Pauley has had it all _ even hives.
   The former ``Today'' co-host, now a fill-in anchor on the ``NBC
Nightly News,'' told New York magazine that at age 7, she broke
into hives after being punished for another child's prank.
   ``My eyes swelled up or something glamorous like that and my
mother had to take me home from school,'' she said. ``Later she
took me to a specialist who said that I was a nervous child who
would have to be careful my whole life.''
   Pauley added: `This is good information for a kid who is anxious
about life. Instead I grew up to do live television. I think it's
kind of funny.''
   Pauley got over her problems with hives and headaches years ago,
the magazine reported in its July 23 issue.

   Sara Helena Martin said believing in herself
was the key to her being named America's Young Woman of the Year.
   ``I'm just numb,'' said the 19-year-old Miss Martin of
Schaumburg, Ill., as she received hugs Saturday night from other
contestants who competed for $75,000 in scholarships. ``The way I
got here was being true to myself, believing in my own values.''
   The program, which began in 1958, was known as America's Junior
Miss until the name was changed last year.
   Miss Martin, who plans to become a linguist, won a $30,000
college scholarship.
   Runners-up were Seema Sueko Ahmed, 17, of Honolulu, and Rosalie
Landicho Reyes, 17, of Waynesboro, Miss.

   The wife of Gov. Ray Mabus has given birth
to a girl, the first child born to an incumbent Mississippi
governor since the turn of the century.
   The girl, who was named Elisabeth Hamilton, was delivered by
Caesarean section Sunday at Baptist Medical Center, and weighed 9
pounds, 8{ ounces. The mother, Julie, and the child were doing
well, the governor said.
   ``Daddy almost didn't make it through, but Mom did fine,'' he
said.
   Asked how the birth compared with being elected governor, Mabus
said, ``This is so much better than anything I've ever done in my
life ... no comparison.''
   The last baby born to a Mississippi governor in office was a
daughter of Gov. A.H. Longino, who served from 1900 to 1904.

   President Eisenhower's granddaughter Anne
didn't want him to speak at her high school graduation, and neither
did some of her classmates.
   ``I wanted to keep him for myself, as my grandfather _ not as
the president,'' she recalled Saturday at a one-day conference
bringing together some of the descendants of former presidents. The
event in the town where Eisenhower grew up was part of a
celebration of the centennial of his birthday.
   Ms. Eisenhower said some classmates were upset about the
president's visit because ``they thought the attention would go to
him, and not to them on their graduation.''
   But Eisenhower was a hit with the crowd when he said, ``Ankles
are neat, but knees will always be knobby,'' his granddaughter
recalled.
   ``That was in 1967, when the miniskirt was in style,'' she said.
``He received thunderous applause. Some of those clapping the
hardest were girls who had earlier criticized him.''

   Richard Nixon thinks people who tour his new
library will form a better opinion of his presidency.
   The Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace will be
dedicated Thursday in Yorba Linda, in a ceremony to be attended by
President Bush and former Presidents Reagan, Ford and Nixon.
   The man who resigned the presidency in disgrace in 1974 told the
Los Angeles Times he believes the library will help remove much of
the taint of the Watergate scandal.
   ``Over time, as their interest fades, and if the public
continues to visit the Nixon museum, I would think that all the
events covered will be seen in a more objective perspective,'' said
Nixon, 77. His written remarks were published Sunday.
   Library officials say the $21 million complex will have an
extensive Watergate section, along with many other exhibits showing
the more positive aspects of Nixon's career.

<HEAD>Washington Has Highest Per Capita Spending on Justice Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

   The District of Columbia spent almost four
times the national average on criminal and civil justice in 1988,
the year it became the nation's murder capital, according to a
Justice Department report.
   The city spent about $859 per resident that year for justice
systems, including police protection, the courts and correctional
facilities. The national average per capita spending on justice
activities by state and local governments that year was $218. The
state that spent the least per capita was West Virginia, which
spent only about $90 per person.
   Sue Lindgren, the statistician who prepared the report released
Sunday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, speculated that the
nation's capital topped the per capita spending on justice because
the entire district is an urban center.
   ``We know there's more crime in high population density areas
than in rural areas,'' she said.
   Washington D.C. became the nation's murder capital in 1988, an
unwanted, unofficial title it maintained last year as well.
   The second highest per capita spending by state and local
governments on justice activities in 1988 was in Alaska, $541;
followed by New York, $399; California, $316, and Nevada, $315.
Rounding out the top 10 were Arizona, $276; New Jersey, $274;
Hawaii, $249; Massachusetts, $246, and Delaware, $240.
   Those states spending the least, after West Virginia, were
Arkansas, $97; Mississippi, $100; North Dakota, $106; South Dakota,
$116, Indiana, $124; Iowa, $125; Montana, $130; Idaho, $132, and
Kentucky, $133.
   Federal, state and local governments spent a total of $61
billion two years ago for civil and criminal justice.
   Of that total, almost 46 percent, or about $28 billion, was
spent on police protection. Another 31 percent was spent on
corrections and about 22 percent was spent on courts, prosecution
and legal services and public defenders.
   Local governments contributed $33.5 billion, or 55 percent of
the money spent on justice systems. State governments spent $22.1
billion, or 33 percent, and the federal government spent $7.8
billion, or 12 percent.
   In the decade from 1979 through 1988, total spending on justice
systems increased by 134.3 percent.
   However, the real increase for the decade was 21.4 percent when
the dollars are adjusted for inflation, the report said.
   The constant dollar spending amounted to a 65 percent increase
during the decade in corrections spending, 34 percent increases in
prosecution, legal services and public defense, a 17 percent hike
in courts and a 3 percent increase in police protection.
   Justice systems received 3.2 percent of all government spending
two years ago. The federal government devoted the smallest portion
of its expenditures for justice: 0.7 percent. States spent 6.1
percent of their money for such activities and cities allocated 6.8
percent of their funds for justice, the report said.

   The savings and loan scandal is dominating
Congress' agenda, raising the question of whether the lawmakers'
top priority is fixing the mess or saving their own hides.
   Certainly the most spectacular work falls in the latter category.
   The Senate last week approved one of its biannual anti-crime
bills with a whole new category of crime: ``S&amp;L kingpin.'' These
conspiratorial characters would get a minimum of 10 years and up to
life in prison if they derive more than $5 million over two years
from their crimes.
   The bill also would extend federal racketeering laws to bank
fraud cases, even though those cases may not involve organized
crime, as was the purpose of the racketeering statute. Private
citizens could even earn bounties for becoming informants.
   The House, meantime, voted as part of a spending bill to put the
Secret Service on the S&amp;L case.
   The Senate S&amp;L provisions passed 99-1, with only Sen. Bill
Armstrong, R-Colo., voting against it. ``They are reactionary, akin
to an impromptu public hanging,'' he said.
   Armstrong _ who is retiring at year's end _ contends the intent
of the Senate bill was to ``provide a smoke screen to shift the
culpability for the S&amp;L mess from the Congress and onto a few
unscrupulous businessmen.''
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., chairman of the Senate Republicans'
campaign committee, told reporters he had doubts about the Senate
measure but voted for it anyway.
   He said he can't prove it but he senses a ``throw the rascals
out'' sentiment growing among the voters.
   A public hanging is exactly where Congress wants to get the
voters looking elsewhere. Of course, Republicans and Democrats
differ on the victim.
   Democrats are salivating over the involvement of presidential
son Neil Bush in the $1 billion failure of a Denver thrift.
   Republicans are searching for an equally satisfying target, and
in the meantime are resurrecting the political corpses of Democrats
like former Speaker Jim Wright, who quit the House after charges of
unethical financial dealings.
   The ante could rise, in terms of penalties for those convicted
of S&amp;L-related offenses. If Congress' record on drug laws is any
example, S&amp;L crooks would do well to turn themselves in now.
   As the nation's scourge of illegal drugs continued to worsen
through the 1980s, Congress responded before each election with
more laws and harsher penalties.
   Of course, there are some important differences between the two
cases.
   Few members of Congress are ever accused of dealing drugs. Many,
however, have received campaign contributions from the S&amp;L industry
and some have even served on the boards of thrifts.
   And as the political barbs fly, tempers are starting to flare.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., with his Mr. Clean
reputation, angrily denounced House Republican campaign chief Ed
Rollins for complaining that Foley accepted campaign money from
thrifts over the years.
   Another difference between drugs and the S&amp;L scandal is the fact
that most of the disaster has already happened, tens of billions of
dollars are gone, and Congress and the White House seem to be
closing the barn door a little late.
   But that won't keep Congress from slamming that door hard to
make the maximum amount of noise.
   Asked about it last week, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
responded philosophically. ``Obviously, it is a recurring fact of
human life that we learn from our mistakes,'' he said.

   President Bush paid a visit to Lee Atwater at
the home of the Republican National Committee chairman who is
fighting a brain tumor.
   Bush said nothing to reporters who inquired about Atwater's
condition.
   When Bush arrived Sunday evening, Atwater's wife, Sally, greeted
him at the door with the couple's three-month-old daughter, Sally
Theodosia, in her arms.
   Before entering the two-story brick home, Bush took the baby
into his arms as photographers snapped pictures.
   Bush made the visit after returning by helicopter from a weekend
at Camp David, Md., with his wife, Barbara. Only his son, George W.
Bush, accompanied him to Atwater's house.
   Atwater, 39, collapsed during a speech in March and has
undergone extensive radiation treatment for the brain tumor. He
spends several hours a day in physical therapy.
   While Atwater has not returned to work at the Republican Party's
headquarters, officials say he keeps track of things by telephone.
   The Atwaters, who also have two older daughters, live in a
fashionable section of the capital.

<HEAD>Folklorists: Early Medicine Not for the Timid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   From colorful charlatans proficient in
the use of amputation saws to dentists with blunt instruments who
took just one approach _ in or out _ medical practices of the late
18th century were not for the timid.
   That much quickly becomes clear when members of the Dublin
Seminar for New England Folklife get together to talk about the
gory delights of pre-1850s medicine.
   ``It's absolutely gruesome,'' said Peter Benes, spokesman for
the folk history group.
   ``We tend to think quite romantically about the 18th and early
19th centuries until you run square across advertisements of New
York dentists,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in
Concord.
   Their latest conference, held over the weekend, covered such
topics as ``Spruce Beer and Cod Liver Oil in Popular and
Professional Medicine'' and ``The Democratic Medicine of Dr. Elias
Smith.''
   Benes has researched a paper on itinerant physicians and
surgeon-dentists from 1760 to 1830, including the history of one
Anthony Yeldall, who traveled through Maryland, New Jersey,
Connecticut and Massachusetts and once set up shop on the Westfield
town common, attracting business with a high-wire act and jugglers.
   The side shows were common among the traveling doctors, Benes
said.
   ``You hear a noise in the town common. Shouting, screaming,
applause, a drum beating. You walk over there to find out what's
going on. You're part of a crowd with say 150 people watching two
trapeze artists or a clown. ... While he's still got those 150
people around him, Yeldall gets up and starts haranguing the
audience. That's the whole mountebank concept,'' he said.
   In fact, Yeldall must have had some skills, because he lectured
knowledgeably on the eyes and was able to remove cataracts,
probably with a knife or razor, Benes said.
   The swift-moving healer was despised by mainstream physicians,
partly because of his success and partly because he would be ``a
step ahead of his failures while the established physicians lived
with theirs,'' Benes said.
   The questionable element persisted until disciplined medical
societies were founded in the second and third decades of the
1800s, he said.
   The conference in Deerfield was offered in conjunction with
Boston University's program in American and New England Studies.
   Dr. J. Worth Estes, a BU professor of pharmacology, showed off
his special collection of lethal-looking medical tools, including
amputation saws.
   ``One of the things I'll be talking about is the reliance on
drugs that made people throw up. That was standard procedure,'' he
said.
   Estes, who is also a medical historian, presented a paper titled
``Samuel Thomson Rewrites Hippocrates.''
   Thomson was a New Hampshire itinerant healer who developed a
theory that all disease was caused by cold and, therefore, could be
treated by application of heat.
   For general good health, Thomson liberally prescribed a potent
emetic. He was tried for murder after a patient took a little too
much of the drug, but the jury acquitted him after only five
minutes' deliberation.
   Like Thomson's jurors, patients of the era were long-suffering
when it came to medicine, Estes said.
   ``They didn't go to the great lengths to prevent death. They
didn't bewail death as much as we do,'' he said.
   Life expectancy was only about 35 years, most people didn't live
long enough to contract ailments such as cancer and heart disease
and of those who did get sick, most got better regardless of a
doctor's efforts, Estes said.

<HEAD>Heart Attack Victims Successfully Quit Smoking With Nurses' Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heart-attack patients who are advised to
quit smoking on leaving the hospital appear to have better success
when they get periodic telephone calls of encouragement from
nurses, researchers say.
   Of the 72 heart-attack patients who completed a nurse-managed
intervention program by Stanford University, 51 of them, or 71
percent, successfully quit smoking for one year, Stanford
researchers reported in Sunday's Annals of Internal Medicine.
   Of the 58 patients who did not get calls, only 26 of them, or 45
percent, had cut out tobacco, the study found.
   Many quit-smoking programs attack both the psychological and the
biological addiction to nicotine, but some smokers benefit from
additional, outside help, the researchers said.
   ``Nurses represent the largest cadre of health care
professionals available to assist physicians with interventions for
smoking cessation,'' wrote the researchers, led by Dr. C. Barr
Taylor.
   Dr. Steven Cummings of the University of California at San
Francisco, who studies physicians' attitudes and training on
smoking cessation programs, said the Stanford study demonstrates
that phone calls are an effective way of providing support to
smokers trying to quit.
   The nurse-managed program usually began one day after patients
left the hospital's coronary care unit. Smokers were given manuals
and audio tapes on cessation techniques and counseling while
hospitalized. Nurses then followed up on the care by calling
patients weekly for one month and then monthly for the next four
months.
   Patients who found it more difficult to quit met with nurses in
an outpatient clinic, and some received prescriptions for nicotine
gum. The nurses' intervention ended after six months.
   The researchers verified the volunteers' smoking status through
biochemical tests or through family members and friends.
   The researchers attributed the success of the intervention
program to the early start while patients were hospitalized and the
frequent and convenient contact between patients and nurses.
   Smoking is blamed for the deaths of 390,000 Americans each year,
according to federal statistics. About 1.3 million smokers quit
every year, but about 1 million start smoking.

   In the West Coast's curious crime response to
New York City's blowgun-toting Dartman, Los Angeles has the Manhole
Man.
   Less violent but no less offbeat than the Manhattan dart blower,
an unknown culprit has lifted 150 manhole covers in the last week,
officials said Saturday.
   Manhole Man has created gaping traffic hazards around town and
it will cost $14,598 to replace the heisted hole covers, said
Delwin Biagi, city Bureau of Sanitation director.
   The motive for stealing the 100-pound hunks of metal is known
only to Manhole Man, he said.
   New York's so-called Dartman stalked well-dressed women in
midtown Manhattan this summer, targeting their backsides with his
homemade barb-pointed needle darts.
   Police made an arrest in the case after 52 attacks. His victims
were not seriously injured.

   Family and friends sang ``Happy
Birthday'' outside Rose Kennedy's window to honor her 100th year in
the Kennedy clan's largest gathering since her son's 1960
presidential victory.
   The matriarch of the political family plagued by tragedy stayed
indoors Sunday during the early birthday party attended by 370
invited guests, including grandson-in-law Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   ``She has good days and bad days, but today she was great,''
said Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert Kennedy. ``It was a
happy, joyous event.''
   The family planned a small, private celebration next Sunday, her
actual birthday.
   Four of her five surviving children, most of her 28
grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren joined a glittering
assembly of dignitaries in singing ``Happy Birthday'' outside Mrs.
Kennedy's window.
   ``In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center
of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we
always came,'' Sen. Edward Kennedy said.
   The ailing 99-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, was visited
privately by family members during the three-hour luncheon. She was
briefly wheeled onto the porch by a nurse later, after most guests
had left.
   ``As she told me just a few days ago, `I'm like old wine _ they
don't bring me out very often, but I'm well preserved,''' her sole
surviving son said.
   The life of the strong-willed woman who endured the
assassination of two sons and the deaths of two other children was
remembered in an 18-minute film by Oscar-winning filmmaker Terry
Sanders that brought tears to the eyes of many at the celebration.
   Sen. Kennedy narrated the film, which chronicled the union
between the Boston politician's daughter and businessman Joseph P.
Kennedy. It featured the voice of Mrs. Kennedy talking about the
joys and sadness in her life.
   ``She always stressed the importance of family loyalty and
family strength,'' said Eunice Kennedy Shriver, standing before a
photographic exhibit of her mother's life. ``She taught us we were
much stronger as a family than as individuals.''
   Among those joining the family were humorist Art Buchwald, actor
Tom Hulce, Olympic skier Billy Kidd, Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos and Kennedy historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr.
   Robert MacNeil of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour'' was master of
ceremonies. Singer Maureen McGovern performed a medley of Mrs.
Kennedy's favorite Irish songs, including ``Rose of Tralee.''
   It was the biggest Kennedy family reunion in 30 years, when the
clan assembled to celebrate the election of John F. Kennedy as
president.
   Each table under a red-striped tent overlooking Nantucket Sound
at the Cape Cod estate featured a framed portrait of Mrs. Kennedy
and a bouquet of pink roses.
   Inside the main house were 100 red roses sent by the senator's
family. The Massachusetts Democrat cut the first slice of birthday
cake.
   President Kennedy's daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg,
attended. But her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and her
brother, John Jr., did not.
   Schwarzenegger and his wife, TV reporter Maria Shriver, attended
with baby daughter Katherine. Shriver is the daughter of Eunice and
Sargent Shriver.
   Various grandchildren ran up to each other and embraced, also
hugging and kissing their aunts Ethel Kennedy, Joan Kennedy,
Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. Mrs. Lawford and
Mrs. Smith are daughters of Rose Kennedy.
   Four of Mrs. Kennedy's children died tragically. Her eldest son,
Joe Jr., was killed while flying a mission in World War II, and
daughter Kathleen died in a plane crash in France. President
Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and in 1968 Sen. Robert Kennedy
was shot to death in Los Angeles during his presidential campaign.
   Rose Kennedy's mentally retarded daughter, Rosemary, remained in
a Wisconsin nursing home. The event was staged in part to honor
people working to help the retarded, a cause championed by Mrs.
Kennedy for decades.
   ``One of the things that has made the greatest difference to our
mother is the work in which the current generation is involved,''
Sen. Kennedy said. ``Mother told them and us that that is her
greatest birthday present.''

<HEAD>Indians Keep Bridge Blocked in Canadian Land Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKA, Canada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mohawk Indians locked in a land dispute with
authorities have reversed themselves and kept up their blockade of
a bridge into Montreal.
   The Mohawks said they decided not to lift the blockade of
vehicles, as promised, because authorities had reneged on a promise
to reduce the number of provincial police in Oka, about 20 miles to
the southwest.
   The town was the scene of a shootout Wednesday between
authorities and Mohawk warriors manning barricades to block the
expansion of a golf course onto land they claim is theirs.
   One police officer, 31-year-old Marcel Lemay, was killed in the
confrontation, but it is not clear if he was shot by Mohawks or
fellow officers. Lemay was to be buried today.
   Talks aimed at ending the Oka standoff between armed Mohawks and
police broke off Sunday night. Quebec province was represented by
Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia, who said the negotiations
would resume today.
   He said Sunday that he believed that the two sides were close to
patching up their agreement of the night before.
   ``We have obtained the cooperation of Quebec police,'' said
Ciaccia.
   ``They have reduced the number of personnel _ however, not in
such a way as to affect our own security,'' he said. He refused to
say how many of the estimated 1,000 police officers at Oka had
pulled out.
   The Mohawks of the Kahnawake reserve blocked the Mercier bridge
on Wednesday in sympathy with the Oka Indians. The bridge blockade
enraged some residents, who faced massive traffic jams trying to
get into Montreal from the south shore of the St. Lawrence River by
alternate routes.
   On Saturday evening, a mob of about 2,000 residents gathered at
the boundary of the Kahnawake reserve and shouted racist slurs at
the natives, who did not appear to be armed.
   At one point, they burned a dummy bearing the words ``Non aux
Warriors,'' or ``no to the Warriors.'' They also chanted war
whoops, danced and waved Quebec flags.
   The crowd dispersed only after Ciaccia emerged from six hours of
talks with Indian negotiators in Oka and promised the bridge
blockage would be lifted in return for a ``significant reduction''
in the police presence in Oka.
   But in a statement released Sunday, the Mohawk council of
Kahnawake said the deal was off because police forces had been
boosted both at Oka and near the Mercier bridge.
   On Sunday, a crowd of about 500 people gathered again at the
bridge. The afternoon started quietly as people carrying binoculars
and potato chips installed their folding lawn chairs near police
barricades to watch developments.
   Later, the crowd became restive and cheered as an effigy of a
Mohawk carrying a bow and arrow was hung from a lamppost.
   In Oka, a town of 3,000, police and the Indians from the
reservation there stared at each other across their own sets of
barricades on Sunday.
   About 1,000 police officers blocked access to the town. Police
also prevented anyone from taking food into the Mohawk-occupied
area.

   A psychiatric patient screaming
anti-Semitic slogans stabbed four children in the playground of a
Jewish school today, police said.
   The children, ranging in age from 6 to 8, were hospitalized
after the attack, which occurred before classes started at the
Hebrew Congregation's Kadimah College and Kindergarten school.
   Witnesses said the woman, identified in court as 52-year-old
Pauline Janet Williamson, was shouting anti-Semitic slogans as she
rushed into the playground and began stabbing the screaming
children.
   She was disarmed by a male teacher on duty at the playground.
   Staff members and parents rushed to help the injured children as
schoolmates watched in horror.
   Conditions of the hospitalized children were not immediately
available, although it appeared that none of the injuries was
life-threatening.
   Ms. Williamson, 52, did not enter a plea when charged with four
counts of attempted murder in Auckland District Court on Monday
afternoon.
   She was remanded to Carrington Hospital, a psychiatric facility
where she has been an outpatient. She was ordered to be kept under
``complete security and close observation'' until her next court
appearance.
   Police recovered a kitchen knife with a four-inch-long blade
after the attack. Jewish leaders said the woman was not connected
with the school.
   A Jewish student outside the school said the suspect had been
there Saturday to see an art exhibition. The student said she had
been turned away when she threatened a woman attendant.

   A dancer for the rap group Heavy D &amp; The

authorities said.
   Troy Dixon, 22, whose stage name is Trouble T-Roy, died Sunday
evening of of injuries suffered in the fall, said officials at
Wishard Hospital.
   Police said Dixon was standing on the third-level ramp at the
Market Square Arena late Saturday when another group member, while
fooling around, rolled a trash barrel down the ramp toward him.
Dixon jumped on a 4-foot retaining wall to avoid the barrel and
fell over backward to the ground, police said.
   ``It was an absolute freaky accident,'' said group manager Carol
Kirkendaul.
   The Rev. Charles R. Williams, president of Indiana Black Expo,
said the group had performed at the arena earlier Saturday as part
of the Black Expo.
   The group, from Mount Vernon, N.Y., was on a 10-city tour and
was one of the headline acts for Black Expo, which also featured
the rap group Public Enemy.
   Kirkendaul said the group is in shock, and an upcoming concert
in Detroit had been postponed.
   Heavy D &amp; The Boyz won a Soul Train Music Award and a NAACP

   An American identified as the buyer
in a drug deal in which a colonel and two other alleged dealers
were slain was actually a U.S. drug agent working with police, a
U.S. official said today.
   On Tuesday, police and National Bureau of Investigation agents
shot and killed Col. Rolando de Guzman, deputy chief of the
military's Northern Luzon Command, his intelligence chief Maj.
Franco Calanog and a military informant.
   The bureau's director, Alfredo Lim, said the three were trying
to sell $10 million in heroin to an American, Phil Needham, who
escaped after shooting broke out.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said today that Needham
was actually a Drug Enforcement Administration agent on temporary
assignment from his post in Bangkok, Thailand.
   Schrager said said Needham was working on a case with the
National Bureau of Investigation but refused to elaborate. The
Associated Press telephoned the DEA office in Bangkok and asked to
speak to Needham but was told he had ``just stepped out.''
   The shooting has produced a major national scandal. De Guzman's
colleagues in the military branded the killings ``cold-blooded
murder'' and said their investigation showed the three were shot at
close range.
   That raised doubts about the report of a shootout.
   Last week, military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered
the arrest of all police and NBI agents involved in the operation
pending completion of an investigation.
   Brig. Gen. Gumercindo Yap, chief of the Northern Luzon Command,
said he was having trouble controlling his troops because of their
anger over the colonel's slaying.
   Also today, the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted unnamed
military sources as saying Needham enticed de Guzman into making
the sale by telling him proceeds would finance a future coup
attempt against President Corazon Aquino.
   The nationally circulated newspaper quoted the source as saying
de Guzman's enemies wanted him eliminated because he had helped put
down some of the six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   Regardless of whether the allegation is true, the fact that an
American was involved is likely to increase speculation that the
shooting was part of a conspiracy beyond simply arresting drug
dealers.
   De Guzman and Calanog were buried Sunday with full military
honors, and speakers praised them as ``heroes'' in the 21-year war
against Communist rebels.
   Pallbearers at de Guzman's funeral included Maj. Gen. Cesar
Nazareno, the victim's classmate at the Philippine Military Academy
and current chief of the national police.
   Last week, Mrs. Aquino appointed a commission to investigate the
shooting in an apparent bid to prevent the incident from leading a
virtual war between the military and the police.
   On Saturday, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon said Lim and de
Villa had agreed to refrain from further public comment until the
investigation was finished.

<TEXT>
   A snag that kept a daredevil from
plunging over Niagra Falls in a barrel probably saved his life,
said the man who promised to try again after he pays the fine for
the failed illegal stunt.
   Dave Munday, who survived going over the falls in a barrel in
1985, was trying to become the first person to live through a
second descent Sunday when his foam-padded barrel got caught on a
rocky shelf about a foot from the edge.
   Munday's 650-pound barrel was left partially hanging over the
brink of the 176-foot Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side of the
Niagara River.
   The area directly below the spot where the current took the
barrel is very rocky, the stuntman said.
   ``I've never been a religious man, but something stopped it,''
he said. ``A lot of the guys said it was fate that stopped it.
Probably I would have been dead if it went over.''
   Munday, 53, of Caistor Center, Ontario, was charged with
violating laws that prohibit river stunts. He faces a possible
$8,500 fine. Police confiscated Munday's 4-foot-by-7-foot barrel
after it was pulled out of the rapids with a crane.
   Munday said he will make another attempt to go over the falls as
soon as he pays the fine. He said he probably won't try the stunt
again this year.
   Niagara Parks Police, who patrol the Canadian side of the twin
waterfalls, said Munday's barrel was dropped into the river about
660 feet above the brink of the Horseshoe Falls about shortly
before 5 a.m. Sunday.
   Police spokesman George Bailey said Ontario Hydro had been
diverting half the river's flow overnight to power its
hydroelectric plant. That kept the river level low, helping snag
Munday's barrel on the rocky ledge, he said.
   Munday said he wanted to be nearer the center of the river,
where the volume of water is greater and provides a better cushion
against the rocks at the bottom.
   On Oct. 5, 1985, Munday became the seventh daredevil to
successfully go over the falls in a vessel. Three others who tried
before him died.
   Last month, a man who went over the falls in a kayak apparently
died. The battered kayak belonging to Jessie Sharp, of Ocoee,
Tenn., was found below the falls, but his body has not been
recovered.
   After his 1985 plunge, Munday told reporters, ``Anyone who would
go over the falls twice would have to be crazy.''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has moved to end
the Communist Party's longtime control of the airwaves, decreeing
that the state broadcasting monopoly must provide access to
competing voices.
   His decree ``on Democratization of Television and Radio'' was
read on the main evening news program, Vremya, Sunday just hours
after tens of thousands of people braved a driving rain to gather
at the Kremlin gates in the capital's first mass demonstration
against the Communist Party.
   Although the decree did not appear a direct response to the
demonstration, Gorbachev's decision to open the airwaves to groups
other than the Communist Party and government comes amid growing
criticism of central authorities.
   The Communists' fortunes are in decline as forces of democracy
gain strength and demand that the party, blamed for plunging the
country into economic crisis, be stripped of all its political
monopolies.
   The decree on broadcasting was issued a month after the Supreme
Soviet legislature passed the nation's first law guaranteeing
freedom of the press and creating broad rights for journalists and
publishers.
   The press law gave non-government and non-party groups the right
to own and operate newspapers and magazines, ending what
effectively had been a decades-old monopoly held by Communist
authorities.
   Rather than appeasing popular opinion, however, greater media
openness has helped fuel public anger toward central authorities,
as demonstrated in the march on the Kremlin.
   ``Communist worms _ this corpse won't feed you anymore,'' read a
poster carried by a demonstrator on Sunday. One woman hoisted a
pair of shoes worn into tatters and labeled, ``Slave of the Party.''
   Police used trucks and barricades to block the entrance to Red
Square, and the marchers instead gathered around a sound truck in
the adjacent Manezh Square, just under the red brick walls and
towers of the Kremlin.
   The demonstrators cheered when a speaker called out the names of
three leading reformers who last week announced they were quitting
the Communist Party: Russian republic President Boris N. Yelstin,
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak.
   The protesters, estimated by a police officer and local
television to number 50,000, shouted, ``Down with the criminal
Communist Party!'' as they huddled under a sea of umbrellas.
   ``Every Communist to his own mausoleum!'' read another poster,
alluding to the mausoleum of Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin a few
hundred yards away. Many Soviets regard Lenin as a deity, and
thousands file through his crypt daily to see his mummified body.
   Soviet reforms have been transferring power from the party that
Lenin founded to elected legislatures throughout the country, and
to the newly strengthened presidency held by Gorbachev.
   Last week, the 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party
re-elected Gorbachev as general secretary and adopted his proposal
to restructure and expand the party's leading body, the Politburo.
Henceforth, the Politburo, which once ran the nation, will concern
itself largely to party affairs.
   The decree on broadcasting, which was also carried by the
official Tass news agency, states that growing democracy in the
country requires a ``cardinal change in the nature of the country's
television and radio broadcasting.''
   The guidelines for radio and television are currently set by a
state committee.
   The decree ``recognizes the need to determine a legal basis for
the activities of television and radio broadcasting under new
conditions'' and recommendsd that parliament adopt appropriate
laws. Those laws apparently would correspond to the press law
passed June 12.
   Until now, only groups approved by the state committee had
access to Soviet television and as a result the Communist Party
received large segments of time on the airwaves.
   The decree emphasized the inadmissibility of monopolizing ``air
time by this or that party, political current or group,'' Tass
reported.
   Hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in
the last several years.
   In the Baltic states, and other republics at odds with Moscow
over their status within the Soviet Union, elected governments have
declared that local radio and television stations belong to them.
   However, the decree stresses control by the Soviet government
over the legal status of radio and television stations in the
republics.
   ``Any acts taken by republican, territorial and regional bodies
without coordination with the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers and
aimed at changing legal or property status'' will be considered
invalid, Tass reported.
   The decree came during a time of change within the television
industry. The government newspaper Izvestia reported Friday that 67
new television studios were to be built in the next 10 years,
mostly in the non-Russian fringes of the Soviet Union.
   Izvestia quoted Henrykas Juskiavicius, deputy director of the
State Television and Radio Committee, as saying that his
organization broadcasts TV programs in 48 languages and radio
programs in 72 languages spoken by different ethnic groups in the
Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today, and stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged in
moderate trading.
   The dollar closed at 148.43 yen, up 1.01 yen from Friday's
finish of 147.42 yen. It opened at 148.20 yen and ranged between
148.05 yen and 148.47 yen.
   Spot transactions totaled $7.959 billion, down from Friday's
$12.837 billion.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 377.36
points, or 1.16 percent, to 33,021.73. The benchmark index had
gained 69.05 points on Friday.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 580 million shares,
up from Friday's 500 million shares.
   In bond dealings, the price of No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds was quoted at 87.06 points as of 5 p.m., slightly
up from 87.02-point close Friday. The yield was 7.185 percent, down
from 7.190.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's soft recovery followed
Friday's cut in the U.S. key federal funds rate. Friday's U.S.
producer price and retail sales data also showed stronger economic
activity than expected, they said.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said, however, that
market activities were centered on covering short positions as
participants adjusted their positions.
   Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank said otherwise there was little
specific market-affecting news. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's
congressional statement last Thursday ``has been played out,'' she
said.
   The dollar plunged to a 4{-month low of 147.42 yen at Friday's
close after Greenspan's congressional testimony that the central
bank is poised to ease its money policy.
   On the stock market, traders said share prices firmed in
response to the easing of the U.S. Federal Funds rate and strong
advances of the New York stocks Friday.
   Masahiro Umemori of Nomura Securities said large-capital and
high-priced stocks joined the rally, although trading was thin, for
the first time in several weeks.
   ``It is a good sign, although investors are still uncertain how
the easing of the U.S. rate would affect Japan's interest rates and
market,'' Umemori said.

<HEAD>Thousands Take First Ride On Blue Line Trolley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The price was right, so thousands took a free
weekend ride on the new Southern California light-rail trolley line
that transportation officials hope will make commuters forsake
their smog-spewing cars.
   Riders of the Blue Line, which links downtown with Long Beach,
can ride free until the end of July, when a $1.10 one-way fare
takes effect.
   The $877 million rail line's inaugural weekend featured live
bands along the 22-mile route that drew combined crowds nearing
100,000, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies counted more than
43,000 Blue Line riders Sunday.
   ``Everything has gone off really smoothly so far,'' said Deputy
Rafael Estrada.
   No violence was reported and deputies made just one arrest of a
man who allegedly cut a hole through a 6-foot fence along the rail
line because he wanted to pass through.
   Area residents have complained the Blue Line fences have divided
neighborhoods and separated merchants from their customers. Other
critics say commuters will shun the Blue Line because it passes
through some of the most gang-plagued communities in the county.
   The overhead-powered rail is the first part of a $10 billion,
150-mile rail grid planned into the next century for Los Angeles,
where freeways get so jammed that relatively short commutes can
take an hour or more.
   A projected 5,000 to 7,000 riders a day are expected to board
the coaches that travel at speeds reaching 55 mph.
   Included in that system is the $1.3 billion Metro Rail subway,
which suffered a setback Friday when fire ravaged a maintenance
tunnel under construction. The first 4-mile segment was scheduled
to open in 1993.

<HEAD>Wounded Pour Into Hospital; Heavy Fighting In Suburb</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: The following is partly based on a pool report from
journalists in Monrovia, among them Associated Press correspondent
Michael Goldsmith.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid fears Monrovia will soon fall to
rebels, hundreds of civilians are fleeing the city center and a
steady stream of refugees are heading toward neighboring Sierra
Leone.
   Witnesses reported heavy fighting between government and rebel
forces on the capital's heavily populated eastern outskirts on
Sunday, half of which were said by Western military observers to
now be under rebel control.
   About a quarter of this West African nation's 2 million people
live in Monrovia.
   There was no official casualty count. However, French and
Belgian doctors at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic hospital said people
were brought in from the eastern suburbs all day Sunday with
gunshot wounds.
   St. Joseph's is the only hospital operating in the capital.
   Diplomatic and international relief sources reported a flow of
refugees heading toward Sierra Leone by truck, car, bicycle or on
foot.
   Refugees had stopped flowing across Liberia's borders until
Friday because of reports the rebels had cut the roads out of the
country. When it became clear Saturday that escape routes were
still open, the refugee flow resumed.
   An air of lawlessness settled over the city as people streamed
toward the countryside to seek refuge and food, and doctors from
the French relief group Doctors Without Borders struggled to help
the injured.
   A 24-year-old city resident, Alice Bahn, said she was with two
young boys Saturday when government soldiers surrounded them.
   ``Both the boys were shot and killed,'' she said. ``I put my
hands up, but they shot anyway. I was lucky to get away. ...'' Ms.
Bahn was brought into St. Joseph's with a serious bullet wound in
her face.
   Next to her were two girls, ages 10 and . They were brought in
Sunday morning, two weeks after they were shot somewhere in bush
country.
   ``We hope they will survive,'' said their surgeon, Robert Kpoto.
``They have not been treated for a long time, and the younger one
is in quite critical condition.''
   Temporary refugee camps have been set up all around the city and
many of the fleeing civilians are seeking refuge there. Twenty-two
such camps now house 40,000 refugees in Monrovia, and the total is
growing daily, said a Dutch member of the international medical
team, Dr. Ron Oud.
   Workers in the camps said government soldiers had been roaming
around the camps every night, shooting wildly and threatening to
break in.
   The workers also said soldiers have been threatening to seize
Gio and Mano tribesmen at the camps. They are considered enemies of
President Samuel Doe's Krahn tribe in the six-month-old insurgency
that has turned into tribal warfare.
   Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said government
soldiers were becoming increasingly undisciplined, holding up
vehicles to demand money and cigarettes.
   ``Every soldier is doing his own thing,'' one victim of such an
incident reported.
   Monrovia remained without electricity and water main service on
Sunday. The only fresh drinking water came from wells.
   Virtually all food stores were closed, and prices of staples
were skyrocketing. A small packet of biscuits was offered by a
street trader Sunday for $10.
   The insurgent National Patriotic Front is led by Doe's former
associate, Charles Taylor. The rebels, who began their revolt in
December, accuse Doe of corruption and human rights abuses.
   Human rights groups have accused both sides of slaughtering
hundreds of civilians.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of American slaves who founded this country in 1847.
   While besieging Monrovia, the insurgents are consolidating their
control of the rest of Liberia. On Saturday, they were reported to
have captured the provincial capital of Voinjama, about 140 miles
north of Monrovia.
   On Sunday, the rebels' chief negotiator left Sierra Leone after
peace talks mediated by the Economic Community of West African
States.
   Thomas Woewiyu said he was going to confer with the rebel
leadership about whether ``there is some sort of political option
to resolve the conflict without taking that final step and without
destroying what is left of the country.''
   He expected to return to Freetown, the Sierra Leone capital, on
Monday and resume negotiations Tuesday.

   Rain lingered over the flood-ravaged Southwest today, while
storms developed over the East Coast and the Plains.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms over parts of
California, Texas, Nevada, Arizona, South Dakota, Nebraska and
Iowa, and from New England to the Middle Atlantic Coast.
   On Sunday, heavy rain brought flooding to parts of West
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Arizona and
Texas.
   In south-central Texas, more than 12 inches of rain fell near
Eldorado, and the rain-gorged San Saba River rose about 15 feet,
flooding several dwellings and forcing campers to higher ground. A
tornado touched down outside Kerrville, damaging about 20 homes and
injuring one person, police said.
   Tornadoes also touched down near Elmwood, Okla., and close to
the Texas towns of Roosevelt, Panhandle, Charlotte and Conway.
   Sandbags were needed to shore up the rain-swollen Rio Grande
near Albuquerque, N.M.
   Large hail fell near Garden City, Kan., and storm winds gusted
to 70 mph at Lake Powell, Utah.
   Unseasonably cool weather was scattered from Florida to Nebraska.
   The high temperature for the nation was 110 degrees at Taft,
Calif.

<HEAD>Imelda Marcos, Acquitted in New York, Faces New Inquiry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Philippines first lady Imelda Marcos,
acquitted of fraud two weeks ago by a federal jury here, faces new
questioning by a grand jury in Pittsburgh.
   Mrs. Marcos said two federal agents on Friday served her with a
subpoena to appear in Pittsburgh on Sept. 25. The case involves a
never-used nuclear power plant Westinghouse Electric Corp. built in
the Philippines in the early 1980s, when her late husband Ferdinand
Marcos was president.
   ``They said they want me to come and bring all my documents. I
don't really know what this is all about,'' Mrs. Marcos said
Saturday during a party thrown to thank jurors from her New York
trial.
   A source close to Mrs. Marcos who asked not to be identified
said she will appear as ordered unless the government advises her
that she is a target of the inquiry, in which case she would refuse.
   The subpoena was issued on behalf of the Justice Department's
fraud section in Washington. It does not indicate whether Mrs.
Marcos is a target of the investigation.
   U.S. Attorney Thomas W. Corbett Jr. of Pittsburgh declined to
comment, citing the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.
   The subpoena dated July 11 instructed Mrs. Marcos to ``bring all
documents in your possession or under your control ... relating
directly or indirectly to the payment of commissions or anything of
value'' by Westinghouse or Burns &amp; Roe Inc. to the Marcoses or
their agents since Jan. 1, 1973.
   Burns &amp; Roe, an engineering firm, was a subcontractor on the
Philippines project.
   Mrs. Marcos, 61, and Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi,
55, were acquitted July 2 after a 10-week federal trial.
Prosecutors alleged that she helped her husband loot the
Philippines' treasury of more than $220 million, using the money to
buy four New York buildings, artworks and jewelry.
   Khashoggi was accused of falsifying documents to show that he,
not the Marcoses, owned the New York properties and some paintings.
Prosecutors said that was done to circumvent a March 1986 court
order that froze the Marcoses' assets following their ouster from
power.
   Marcos illegally skimmed millions from the Philippine treasury
by demanding kickbacks from companies and banks doing business with
his government, prosecutors said. Westinghouse was not mentioned in
the case.
   In Pittsburgh, Westinghouse spokesman Paul B. Jones said the
subpoena may stem from a lawsuit filed against the company by the
government of Philippines President Corazon Aquino, which is still
seeking to recover the money allegedly stolen by the Marcoses.
   Jones said safety concerns delayed the nuclear plant's opening
and after Marcos was deposed and Aquino took office, the plant
became a political issue.
   ``The Philippine government sued Westinghouse because the plant
was sitting there. They chose not to operate it,'' Jones said.
   He said the suit alleges Westinghouse built a plant that could
not be operated, but declined to comment further.
   Despite the subpoena, Mrs. Marcos' was jovial at the party
Saturday in the penthouse of her posh Manhattan apartment complex.
Among 100 guests were 10 of the 12 jurors who acquitted Mrs. Marcos
and Khashoggi.
   ``It's just a gathering of friends,'' said ex-juror Luellen
White, a subway worker, who left carrying a decorated cake.
   Others departed with bouquets of flowers.
   ``I invited the jurors to thank them and because I thought they
should see some of the good things about the Philippines,'' said
Mrs. Marcos, who entertained her guests by singing ``God Bless
America'' and Philippine songs.

   Toxic fumes at a steel plant killed one
worker and injured 17 others, fire officials said.
   Subcontractors working on a steam drum at the Great Lakes Steel
plant in this Detroit suburb were overcome by fumes Sunday
afternoon, said fire Sgt. Art Andring.
   Two men inside the 5-foot-diameter, 35-foot-long drum suffered
the most intense exposure and one later died, he said.
   The source of the toxic fumes and the chemical that made them
were unknown.
   Andring dubbed the lethal release ``mystery fumes,'' adding that
company investigators did not release any information.
   The drum has an opening on one end that's so small, rescue
workers couldn't get through wearing their scuba-like breathing
equipment, he said. They had to pull their oxygen tanks in behind
them and then strap them on, he said.
   The fumes also wafted through three of the six stories at the
building where scraps of metal are melted down to make steel. The
area was cordoned off but none of the hundreds of workers were
evacuated, Andring said.
   Ron Harris, 47, was killed. David Bittner, 32, was listed in
serious condition early today at Outer Drive Hospital.
   Sixteen other workers complained of symptoms ranging from chest
pain to difficulty breathing and scratchy throats. They were
treated at hospitals and two were held for overnight observation,
Andring said.
   The factory, which employs about 5,000 people, is owned by
National Steel Corp., of which 70 percent is owned by NKK Corp. of
Japan.
   A plant guard, who refused to give his name, said Sunday night
that no one was available to comment on the accident.

   Lawrencia Bembenek, a former model and
Milwaukee police officer serving a life term for the 1981 murder of
her husband's ex-wife, escaped from prison through a laundry room
window, officials said.
   Footprints indicated Ms. Bembenek fled into a wooded area east
of the Taycheedah Correctional Institution, Warden Nona Switala
said. She was discovered missing during a bed check Sunday night.
   Prison guards joined by Fond du Lac County sheriff's deputies
and a sheriff's scent dog searched the wooded area without luck,
Ms. Switala said.
   Prison officials found a section of the 7-foot fence surrounding
the prison where barbed wire had been pulled down.
   No other inmates were missing and there was no sign Ms. Bembenek
had received help from anyone, the warden said.
   Ms. Bembenek, 31, was last seen shortly after 8 p.m. when she
went to do her laundry, Ms. Switala said.
   The State Court of Appeals rejected Ms. Bembenek's request for a
new trial June 20. It was the third time the appeals court had
denied similar requests for a new trial.
   She has maintained her innocence during her eight years in
prison and sought the new trial on grounds her old lawyer, Donald
Eisenberg, had a conflict of interest when representing her.
   Her lawyer for the appeal, Martin E. Kohler, said late Sunday he
was surprised to hear of her escape. Kohler said he last contacted
her two weeks ago and was in the process of petitioning the state
Supreme Court for a review of her case.
   He said he would continue with the appeal despite Ms. Bembenek's
escape.
   She was convicted of murder in the May 28, 1981 shooting of
Christine Schultz in Milwaukee. Mrs. Schultz was the former wife of
Elfred Schultz, a Milwaukee police detective who was married to Ms.
Bembenek at the time of the slaying.
   Schultz has since left the police department and moved out of
state. Ms. Bembenek and Schultz divorced after her conviction.
   Ms. Bembenek would have become eligible to apply for parole
after serving 11 years and 3 months, Ms. Switala said.
   The prison houses about 200 women prisoners in lockups where
conditions range from minimum to maximum security, she said.
   Authorities had not determined what prompted the escape. Guards
reported no problems with Ms. Bembenek as an inmate, Ms. Switala
said.

   A chemical plant fire that burned out of
control today forced the evacuation of up to 500 residents,
authorities said.
   The blaze erupted about 9 p.m. Sunday when a car rammed into the
FMC Chemical Co., police Lt. Roger Enmark said.
   No serious injuries were reported, but 10 firefighters were
checked at a nearby hospital for possible exposure to toxic
chemicals, Enmark said.
   Chemicals including sulfur caused a cloud to form above the
company and surrounding neighborhood, prompting the evacuation,
Enmark said.
   Area residents were taken to a nearby junior high school while
firefighters worked to douse the flames.
   It was not immediately known what happened to the car's driver
after the crash, the lieutenant said.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Parliament Declares Sovereignty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Parliament of the Ukraine, following
sovereignty decrees by other republics, declared today that its own
laws to take precedence over Soviet law, the official Tass news
agency reported.
   The Ukraine is the Soviet Union's second-largest republic, with
more than 50 million people. It also is a key industrial and
farming region.
   The republic's Parliament, meeting in the capital of Kiev,
declared the ``supremacy, independence, absolute authority and
indivisibility'' of Ukrainian authority on the republic's
territory, Tass said.
   But the news agency added that the majority of deputies who
spoke during the Supreme Soviet's debate did not support secession
from the Soviet Union.
   Instead, they said, sovereignty ``should not break the existing
social, economic and cultural and other ties with republics, but
develop them,'' Tass said.
   In its declaration, the Ukraine followed the lead of the huge
Russian republic, the Baltic republics, and several other Soviet
republics clamoring for more independence from the central
government.
   Some Ukrainian nationalists support total independence for their
republic, but the movement is not as far advanced as it is in other
Soviet republics like the Baltics.
   Last week, debate over sovereignty in the republic's Parliament
had caused sharp disagreements and led indirectly to the
resignation of the republic's president, Vladimir Ivashko.
   Ivashko was then chosen deputy chief of the Soviet Communist
Party.
   Today's declaration called for the Ukraine's ``independence and
equal rights in external relations,'' and stated that the republic
has the right to have its own armed forces, Tass said.
   Now, the Ukraine's youth cannot perform military service outside
the republic without parliament's permission.
   The declaration sets a future goal of establishing a
``constantly neutral government, which does not take part in
military blocs'' and opposes the production, proliferation and use
of nuclear weapons, Tass said.
   Ivashko and other deputies to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet were
called back last week from the Soviet Communist Party congress for
the debate on sovereignty.
   Ivashko refused to go, and turned in his resignation. He said he
interpreted his dispute with Parliament over the issue as
indicating that he did not have enough authority to govern the
republic.
   The same day he was nominated to be Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's Communist Party deputy, and he was elected easily.

<HEAD>30 Injured in Ethnic Strife; Airport Chief Killed in Azerbaijan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with airport manager in
Nagorno-Karabakh killed in bombing, husband, son injured. Picks up

<TEXT>
   An airport manager in the ethnically troubled
region of Nagorno-Karabakh has been killed in a bomb explosion that
destroyed her home, the Tass news agency said today. Her son and
husband were reported injured.
   In the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, at least 30 people
were injured in renewed ethnic fighting over the weekend, the
official Soviet news agency reported.
   Tass said the bombing in Nagorno-Karabakh occurred Sunday night.
It said investigators from the Azerbaijani Interior Ministry
earlier had investigated threats against the life of Yevgenia
Ishkhanova, manager of Stepanakert airport.
   According to the Tass report, Ishkhanova's son was seriously
injured in the blast and hospitalized. Her husband escaped with
slight injuries, Tass said.
   Tass said Ishkhanova had been ``engaged in an all-out effort to
increase discipline there and ensure that incoming flights from
Yerevan complied with the schedule.''
   Yerevan is the capital of the neighboring republic of Armenia,
which has been involved in a dispute with Azerbaijan over the
sovereignty of Nagorno-Karabakh, an autonomous Armenian-dominated
enclave.
   Tass said the bombing was carried out by ``those who do not want
the situation in the region, where a state of emergency has been
declared, to improve and want ethnic strife to continue.''
   At least 200 people have died in ethnic violence in the Caucasus
Mountain republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia over the past two
years. The dispute is centered on control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   In Kirghizia, officials reported that new fighting has broken
out between Kirghiz and Uzbeks.
   In the city of Osh, near the Uzbekistan border, shops were
closed, public transportation was at a standstill and troops were
patrolling the streets in armored personnel carriers, Tass said.
   The news agency quoted Kirghiz Interior Minister Viktor
Goncharov as saying that at least 30 people were injured in weekend
fighting, and that 15 were hospitalized.
   ``Crowds of people were gathering in the cities of Osh and Uzgen
and nearby villages in defiance of a ban on rallies and there were
frequent fights between Kirghiz and Uzbeks,'' Goncharov was quoted
as saying on local television Sunday night.
   Ethnic clashes in Kirghizia broke out in early June over the
allocation of land to ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni
Moslems, in the densely populated region where housing is scarce.
Officials said 148 people died in the June fighting and another 885
were injured.
   Tass said an analysis of the unrest by the Kirghizian Communist
Party showed the clashes ``were provoked by grave social problems
in an area with over 50,000 jobless, a severe housing shortage, and
a lack of kindergartens and hospital facilities.''

<TEXT>
   China today launched a new carrier rocket with
the ability to carry an eight-ton satellite into low-level orbit,
according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
   The improved Long March 2 rocket, with four boosters, carried a
simulation satellite and a small, experimental Pakistani satellite
when it blasted off from the Xichang launch site in southwest
China's Sichuan province.
   Xinhua said normal operations were reported for the rocket's
first and second stage boosters, and the satellite control center
called the launch a complete success.
   The rocket blasted off from a newly completed launch pad,
China's largest, built to launch large carrier rockets.
   China entered the international satellite launching business in
April with the sendoff of a 2,750-pound U.S.-made
telecommunications satellite from a Long March 3 rocket.
   China has put 26 of its own satellites into orbit since 1970. In
1988, it signed an agreement with the United States promising to
safeguard satellite technology and to abide by market practices in
pricing and insurance.
   Some experts accuse China of ignoring the agreement and offering
launches on its Long March rockets at half the price of its U.S.
and European competitors.
   China already has contracts to launch an Arab communications
satellite and two Australian satellites within two years.

<HEAD>No. 1 Jewelry Retailer to Stop Selling South African Gold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's largest jewelry retailer today said it
would stop selling jewelry made with South African gold. The
decision followed pickets of its stores by anti-apartheid groups.
   A spokesman for the company, Ratners PLC, said the move was part
of a continuing switch to North American gold supplies.
   One anti-apartheid group, End Loans to South Africa, said it has
suspended its action against Ratners and is asking other groups to
do the same, pending a meeting with Ratners officials.
   Ratners said South African gold is found in 2 percent to 3
percent of its gold jewelry. It had total sales of $1.6 billion in
its fiscal year ended Feb. 3.
   ``It's a fairly simple process for us to remove the final few
percentage points,'' said a Ratners spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The process should be completed in the next
year or two, he said.
   The spokesman denied the move was in reponse to anti-apartheid
pressure. He said he believed only three of its more than 1,000
British stores were picketed.
   ``We're a commercial organization, not a political
organization,'' he said.
   End Loans to South Africa said it and other groups had applied
pressure on Ratners in response to African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela's call to intensify sanctions and boycott South
African goods to end apartheid.
   The ANC is South Africa's leading black opposition movement. It
is seeking to end white minority rule of South Africa's black
majority.
   Ratners has purchased much of its gold jewelry supplies from
Italy, which according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report
gets 91 percent of its gold from South Africa, the group said.
   South Africa produces one-third of the world's gold, the group
said. South African supplies dominate the European gold market and
almost all gold jewelry sold in Britain is made with South African
gold, the group said.
   Non-South African supplies of gold are plentiful, it said.
   ``This historic victory will send clear signals to South Africa
and will hasten an early end to apartheid,'' said Cosmas Desmond,
head of End Loans to South Africa. ``It shows that British business
can no longer avoid the moral implications of collaborating with
apartheid.''

<HEAD>Army Patrols City After Bombs Kill Dozens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HYDERABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of soldiers and
paramilitary police today patrolled this ethnically troubled city
after a series of bomb blasts a day earlier killed at least 45
people and injured 125, police officials said.
   Police manned roadblocks and searched vehicles, but most of the
streets in this city of 3 million appeared deserted.
   Police said they arrested 39 people in connection with the
bombings, but no one has yet been charged with the blasts.
   Earlier, police said they suspected Sindhi nationalists had
carried out the attacks. The nationalists want either greater
autonomy for their province of Sindh or independence.
   On Sunday afternoon, six bombs exploded in several sections of
this city and a seventh ripped through a southbound train as it
left Hyderabad station.
   Witnesses said the blasts killed a total of 55 people. There was
no explanation for their discrepancy with the police toll.
   The two largest cities in Sindh province, Hyderabad and Karachi,
have become urban battlefields in a war between Sindhi nationalists
and Indian immigrants who came to Pakistan following the partition
of the subcontinent in 1947.
   Sindh governor Fakhruddin Ebrahim appealed to residents of both
cities to ``exercise patience.''
   He labelled the bombings ``the most heinous act against
humanity.''
   The leadership of the Mohajir Qami Movement, a politicial party
that represents the immigrants, declared a three-day mourning
period in Hyderabad and areas of Karachi populated by the
immigrants.
   In the last several years, more than 1,000 people have died in
ethnic violence in Sindh province.
   The army has been patrolling Karachi and Hyderabad since May 28.
   The immigrants dominate the cities in Sindh while nationalists
control most of the countryside.
   The immigrants have demanded to be recognized as Pakistan's
fifth ethnic nationality.
   The bombs are believed to have been planted by Sindhi
nationalists protesting the immigrants refusal to honor a one-day
strike called for Sunday. Most businesses in Hyderabad remained
open Sunday.
   The strike was called to protest the arrest several weeks ago of
a Sindhi activist, Qadar Magsi, who was charged with inciting
violence.

<HEAD>Albanians Head For Reception Centers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MARSEILLE, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a warm reception, more than 500
Albanian refugees headed north today to reception centers where
they were to be taught French and learn about their new country.
   Eight of the refugees were hospitalized with what the Red Cross
said were unspecified benign ailments. Most of the rest of the 544
Albanians who arrived in Marseille Sunday were sent on special
trains to Reims, on the way to three reception centers outside
Paris.
   The Interior Ministry will give temporary residence permits to
the refugees, many of whom are gypsies. All have the right to apply
for political asylum.
   The refugees are the last arrivals of about 5,000 Albanians who
boarded five ferries seeking asylum in Western Europe. Albanians
began rushing into foreign embassies in the capital of Tirana on
June 28 after word spread of a family that had been allowed to
emigrate to Italy after spending five years in the Italian Embassy
seeking political asylum.
   The majority of the refugees _ some 3,000 _ traveled to West
Germany during the weekend after about 4,500 refugees were ferried
from Albania to the southern Italian port of Brindisi.
   Italian and Egyptian officials reported today that no new
Albanians had sought asylum in their embassies in Tirana, the
Albanian capital. The Czechoslovak Embassy and the Hungarian
mission were reported empty of refugees.
   The Red Cross conducted preliminary health checks on the latest
arrivals on the train and at Reims. The refugees were then broken
up into three groups and bused to Creil, Emance and Mourmelon in
the Paris region.
   ``The health of most of the refugees is good,'' said a Red Cross
spokesmen in Reims. ``But they all need rest.''
   Carrying little luggage and dressed for the most part in
T-shirts, simple trousers, sandals or clothing donated by the crew
of the ferry Orient Star, the tired refugees settled into their
temporary quarters in Reims for a long sleep. Soldiers had
stockpiled 160 gallons of beverages and 660 pounds of fruit for
their arrival.
   About 30 others arrived earlier by bus at another way station in
Perigueux, southwestern France. Extremely tired, they turned down a
prepared meal and simply asked for drinks and cigarettes.
   Several wept as they got off the bus. Most said all they wanted
was sleep. They were later driven to two separate camps.
   They were jubilant on their arrival in Marseille, crying ``Long
live France'' in Albanian and ``Long live the Albanian people'' as
they disembarked.
   They then sang the Marseillaise, the French national anthem,
just as they had done as their ferry docked in this French port.
   Geological engineer Arian Cipa, who arrived in Marseille Sunday,
summed up the problems of his homeland: ``No freedom. No money. No
future,'' he said.
   ``I could no longer tolerate the complete absence of freedom in
my country,'' the 25-year-old said. ``I know it won't be easy for
me in France, but I hope to succeed. I won't go back to Albania
until the Communists are gone.''
   Cipa took refuge in the French Embassy in Tirana for eight days
before a U.N.-mediated settlement allowed him and thousands of
others to leave for the West.
   The secretary of state for humanitarian action, Bernard
Kouchner, escorted them to special trains bound for reception
centers where fresh clothes, soap and toothpaste awaited.

   Hezbollah fighters attacked a major
stronghold of the rival Shiite Moslem Amal militia in south Lebanon
today, touching off a fierce battle. Police said at least 12 people
were killed and 50 wounded.
   The flareup coincided with a new effort by an Arab League envoy
to persuade Christian and Moslem leaders to agree to a settlement
of the 15-year-old civil war.
   A police spokesman said militiamen of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, mounted a three-pronged attack at 6 a.m. behind a
massive artillery barrage. The target was Jarjou village.
   The Syrian-backed Amal and Hezbollah, or Party of God, have been
fighting each other intermittently for three years seeking control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Today's casualties raised the overall toll to 1,061 people
killed and 3,201 wounded.
   The police spokesman, who could not be identified, said the
identity of those killed was not known. But he said the wounded
included 22 combatants and six civilians.
   Amal's leadership confirmed the attack in a statement, but said
only 20 Amal militiamen were wounded.
   Hezbollah accused Amal earlier of shelling its positions in
Jabal Safi, Mlita and Luweizeh with artillery and rockets.
   Ambulances raced in and out of the combat zone, ferrying victims
to hospitals in Sidon. The mountainous region overlooks Sidon,
provincial capital of south Lebanon, from the southeast. Sidon is
25 miles south of Beirut.
   Also in south Lebanon, militiamen of Sunni Moslem Nasserite
organization clashed with the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army in
Kfar Falous to the east of Sidon.
   There were no immediate casualty reports but the thud of
exploding rockets and artillery shells shook the region.
   The Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Ibrahimi, met for 90 minutes late
Sunday with rebel Gen. Michel Aoun over a peace plan endorsed last
October by Lebanese legislators in a special meeting in the Saudi
Arabian town of Taif.
   The conservative newspaper Al-Anwar, which is close to Aoun,
said the discussion was ``rough.'' Ibrahimi refused to disclose
details of the talks at the shell-wrecked presidential palace in
Baabda, east of Beirut.
   Aoun, the Al-Anwar said, ``stressed the need for a
reconsideration'' of the peace plan.
   The independent newspapr An-Nahar said the mere fact that
Ibrahimi met Aoun was a ``positive'' development. Ibrahimi has made
several trips to Lebanon since October, but met only once with
Aoun, when he officially conveyed to him the agreement immediately
after the Taif meeting.
   Aoun has rejected the accord, ostensibly because it did not
include a fixed timetable for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000
troops from Lebanon. The Syrian forces control 70 percent of
Lebanese territory under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the
22-nation Arab League.
   The Taif plan would redistribute power equally between Moslems
and Christians, who have dominated the government, Parliament,
judiciary and army since independence from France in 1943.
   It was welcomed by Moslems and most Christian leaders, including
warlord Samir Geagea. Geagea is Aoun's main rival in the Christian
camp.
   Differences among Christians over the Taif peace accord have
sparked a bloody conflict between Aoun's troops and Geagea's
Lebanese Forces militia.
   The inconclusive power struggle that erupted Jan. 30 so far has
killed 1,044 people and wounded 2,793, by police count.

<TEXT>
   Iraq has released a British nurse who was jailed
as an accomplice of a journalist executed as a spy, the Foreign
Office said today.
   Daphne Parish was put on a private jet bound for Lusaka, Zambia,
the Foreign Office said.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, responding to overtures from
President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, released the nurse for
``humanitarian reasons,'' the office said.
   The Foreign Office statement said: ``We are grateful to both
presidents.''
   ``I hope it is part of a move to put relations with Britain back
onto a more even keel,'' Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
said in an interview on BBC television.
   Mrs. Parish, 53, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for
allegedly assisting Farhad Bazoft, who was hanged March 15 in
Baghdad.
   Bazoft had been in Iraq working for The Observer, a Sunday
newspaper published in London.
   Bazoft, an Iranian native who traveled on British documents, was
arrested in September trying to check out reports of an explosion
at a military installation. Colleagues insisted he was not a spy,
just an enthusiastic reporter going after a scoop.
   Mrs. Parish was accused of driving Bazoft to the Al-Iskandaria
military complex.
   Following Bazoft's execution, Britain recalled its ambassador
from Iraq and expelled six Iraqi military trainees in protest.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd also announced a freeze on visits
by government ministers to Iraq and canceled a trade mission.
However, Hurd rejected trade sanctions against Iraq.
   Relations between the two countries were further strained in
late March when British customs officers seized 40 components for
nuclear bomb triggers at Heathrow airport, before they could be put
aboard an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad.
   In April, customs officers seized massive steel tubing that had
been ordered by Iraq. British authorities said the tubing appeared
to be designed for a massive artillery gun.
   ``Through the the recent difficulties with Iraq, our desire has
been open and honest dialogue,'' the Foreign Office said.
   ``The release is a constructive signal that they share our
desire. We hope that Mrs. Parish's freedom is the latest step
toward a new and more fruitful relationship with Iraq.''
   Waldegrave said Mrs. Parish appeared to be in good health. The
Foreign Office said it was up to her how long she would remain in
Lusaka.
   The Foreign Office said it had approached a number of states to
seek Mrs. Parish's release, and had not worked solely through
Kaunda.
   Bazoft was one of several journalists who had accepted
invitations to cover elections in Kurdistan in September.
   Just before he was hanged, Bazoft gave British Consul-General
Robin Kealy a note of apology to Mrs. Parish, whom he had
befriended on an earlier visit.
   Mrs. Parish was held at Abu Ghraid prison, the Foreign Office
said.
   Adrian Hamilton, deputy editor of The Observer, said the release
came as a surprise.
   ``Of course, they can never clear the decks when an innocent man
has been hanged, but we are still delighted by Mrs. Parish's
release,'' Hamilton said.
   ``She has been the most stalwart and formidable of women and has
refused to give in to any kind of pressure to make a false
statement.''

   Hikers spent hours trying to revive a
climber struck by lightning when they sought shelter in a stone hut
atop Mount Whitney during a thunderstorm.
   The hiker died after he was flown out Saturday from the summit,
said Ann Melle, Inyo County sheriff's spokesman. At 14,494 feet,
Mount Whitney is the tallest mountain in the Lower 48 states.
   Thirteen hikers in all sought shelter in the hut, and two had to
be revived after the hut was struck by lightning Saturday
afternoon. The hut was built in 1909 for astronomers.
   The group performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Matthew
Edward Nordbrock, 26, of Huntington Beach for five hours before
rescuers arrived by helicopter to take him to a hospital where he
died.
   ``That tore us apart,'' said hiker Glen MacLeod. ``But we looked
around and realized that it could have been all 13 of us that
didn't make it. We were very lucky.''
   Three others were also flown Saturday to Southern Inyo Hospital
in Lone Pine, a small town at the base of Mount Whitney. The rest
of the hikers remained on the summit overnight and were flown out
Sunday morning.
   The hikers described a chaos in the moments after the lightning
bolt hit.
   ``You could smell the burning flesh, burning fur and burning
clothes,'' said Calif Tervo, one of the rescued hikers.
   MacLeod's brother, James, on Sunday showed reporters where
lightning had carved bite-sized chunks of flesh from his shoulders,
back and under an arm. He was revived bu the others after he was
hit.
   ``Every article of clothing I have has holes in it, except my
shoes,'' he said. ``Every muscle in my body must have contracted.
I'm sore all over.''
   MacLeod said doctors told him the electrical charge entered his
right shoulder, where a 4-inch diameter wound could be seen, and
then caused nearly a dozen smaller wounds where it exited his body.
   ``It's unbelievable what it did to me,'' he said. ``It's so
scary to think about how it just went right through me.''

<HEAD>AP and CWA Reach Tentative Three-Year Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and its technical employees
have reached a tentative agreement on a new, three-year contract.
   The package now is subject to ratification by the 310 members of
the Communications Workers of America, the two sides announced.
   In the agreement, reached on Saturday, the AP dropped its
proposal for a deductible on hospital bills. However, the new
contract contains a ``managed care'' system for the health plan
that the AP had sought.
   Under the tentative accord, the weekly salaries of top-scale
technical workers would increase $23.50 the first year, $24 the
second and $24.50 in the third year, bringing wages to $636.50
weekly.
   ``We believe this is a good contract for both sides,'' said
Byron Yake, AP's director of human resources. ``Adding a third year
to the agreement provides everyone with more stability.''
   ``The negotiating committee is recommending acceptance of the
agreement,'' Ed Cotter, a member of the Communications Workers of
America bargaining committee, said in a taped telephone message to
members.
   The CWA said its members earlier had rejected a two-year
contract offer.
   The new agreement includes increases in pension benefits and
geographic differentials in the third year.
   The contract would be retroactive to May 19 and expire May 18,
1993. The technical employees have been working under contract
extensions since their old agreement expired in May.

<HEAD>Bishop Asks Army, Civilians to Fight for Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Anglican bishop is calling on the
government to resign and has appealed to all Kenyans, including
members of the armed forces, to join in a struggle for democracy.
   In a statement made available to The Associated Press today,
Bishop Henry Okullu also blamed President Daniel arap Moi's
one-party government for recent clashes that left 28 people dead
and scores injured. Most of the casualties were pro-democracy
protesters.
   ``I appeal to the sons and daughters of Kenya, wherever they
are, in the armed forces as well as ordinary civilians, to join in
the struggle for democracy, for peace and justice,'' Okullu said in
a statement.
   ``Kenyans are fightfully frustrated with this government and
there is no other way of putting it than that we want to elect a
new and proper government,'' he said.
   Okullu also reiterated his opposition to the policy of detaining
government critics without trial. He said he intends to ask Moi to
have seven current detainees tried in court.
   Kenyan laws permit the indefinite detention of people the
government considers a threat to security.
   The government detained seven people, including two former
Cabinet ministers, this month in a crackdown on advocates of
multiparty democracy in this one-party East African nation.
   The U.S. State Department has also expressed concern over the
government crackdown on supporters of pluralism in Kenya and
several Congressman have proposed halting U.S. military and
economic assistance to Moi's government.
   Moi has said that pluralism would result in tribal conflict
between Kenya's almost 40 ethnic groups.
   Okullu said people are frustrated with government mismanagment
of health services and municipalities, widespread poverty, rigging
of elections, and the government's refusal to call for a national
convention to discuss the country's future.
   The clergyman told the government ``to stop intimidating
people.'' They ``will not give up,'' he said.
   Okullu said Parliament should be dissolved and he called for the
creation of a transitional government of national unity. The bishop
also said an assembly should be convened to write a new
constitution.
   Okullu is one of several Kenyan clergymen who have critized the
government's crackdown on advocates of multiparty politics.
   On Saturday, four clergymen, including Anglican Archbishop
Manasses Kuria, issued a statement calling on Moi to establish a
forum for Kenyans to express their views on the country's future.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded in front of police
headquarters in the cocaine capital of Medellin, killing a
pedestrian, and a series of attacks by gunmen left 39 people dead,
police said.
   In the southern jungle town of Puerto Asis, a bomb exploded
Sunday killing six people and wounding five, police said.
   Police have blamed previous Medellin attacks on cocaine
traffickers. Authorities in Puerto Asis said there was no known
motive for the attack.
   Medellin, with nearly 3 million inhabitants, is Colombia's
second-largest city. The cartel of the same name has supplied up to
70 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States.
   The violence began late Saturday when a car bomb exploded in
front of the Medellin police headquarters, killing a 19-year-old
pedestrian, police said. The bomb contained more than 110 pounds of
dynamite but only 65 pounds exploded, they said.
   Car bombings this year in Medellin have killed 60 people and
wounded hundreds more.
   Two hours after the bombing, unidentified gunmen drove into one
of the city's poor northeastern neighborhoods and killed seven
youths, according to a police statement. Two other youths were
wounded.
   Three more youths were killed in Medellin's San Javier
neighborhood when a group of assailants broke into a party and
began firing. Three people were wounded in the attack, police said.
   Assassins also killed two police officers and a soldier in
separate incidents in the city, the report said.
   The other 26 people were killed in scattered incidents.
   Terrorists allegedly working for drug dealers have killed 144
police officers in Medellin this year. The Medellin cartel has
reportedly offered to pay $4,300 for each police officer
assassinated. Authorities say cocaine traffickers are trying to
force police to give up a search for Pablo Escobar, leader of the
Medellin cartel.
   Medellin police chief Col. Jorge Ferrero said massacres in
Medellin's poor neighborhoods are the work of rival gangs working
for drug traffickers, but human rights activists said many of the
incidents are carried out by police retaliating for attacks.
   In Puerto Asis, a bomb containing 44 pounds of dynamite severely
damaged the Chilimaco hotel, a police statement said. All the
victims were hotel workers.
   In a U.S.-backed crackdown on drug traffickers, about 2,000
soldiers and policemen are hunting for Escobar in the northeastern
region, using helicopters and land patrols.
   The search began six days ago and is part of the government's
11-month-old war against trafickers that began when drug barons
allegedly assassinated leading presidential candidate Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan.
   The traffickers retaliated with a campaign of car bombings,
massacres and police assassinations that has left hundreds dead.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said today
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has removed his objection
to a unified Germany belonging to NATO.
   The agreement between Kohl and Gorbachev cleared a major
obstacle to German unification.
   Kohl also announced agreement on several other major issues,
including a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East
German territory and the size of the armed forces for a united
Germany.
   Kohl, speaking at joint news conference with Gorbachev in the
Soviet Union that was broadcast live on West German television,
said he and Gorbachev had agreed that a unified Germany will be
free and sovereign to choose if and which alliance it will belong
to.
   Kohl said he told Gorbachev that Germany wanted to stay in NATO.
   The Soviet Union had been objecting to NATO membership for a
unified Germany.
   The chancellor was speaking at the end of a two-day visit to the
Soviet Union and talks with Gorbachev aimed at removing Soviet
concerns over German unification. The news conference was held in
the southern Russian city of Zhelosnovodsk.
   Kohl said that Soviet troops should be withdrawn from East
German territory three to four years after Germany is united. The
Soviets now have about 380,000 troops in East Germany.
   During the same period, the armed forces of a united Germany
will be reduced to 370,000 soldiers, Kohl said. The combined
strength of the East and West German armed forces is now about
600,000, with West Germany providing 480,000 men.
   Kohl said the rights of the four World War II victorious powers
will cease immediately after unification, but that their troops
could stay in Berlin as long as the Soviet troops are in East
Germany.
   He said a united Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a
comprehensive treaty that will govern all aspects of their
relations.

<HEAD>Pipeline Accidents Disrupt Gas, Oil Flow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pipeline has ruptured in the Ural mountains,
spewing 735 million cubic feet of natural gas into the air, the
official Tass new agency reported today.
   In a separate incident this weekend, a corroded oil pipeline
sprang a leak, the oil caught fire, and 27 wells had to be shut
down, Tass said.
   An official blamed the accidents on poor construction and
maintenance.
   In the first incident, the pipeline rupture halted supplies of
more than 3,500 million cubic feet of natural gas coming from the
Tyumen region, 900 miles east of Moscow, the official news agency
reported.
   ``Over 21 million cubic meters (735 million cubic feet) were
released into the air,'' Tass said. ``The site of the accident
cannot be accessed by road, further complicating the problem.''
   Rescue teams, helicopters and equipment were sent to the scene,
and bridges were being built across marshes to allow workers to
reach the ruptured pipeline, it said.
   At the Belozerneft field in the same region, a corroded oil
pipeline sprang a leak, Tass said. ``The oil caught fire, 27 wells
had to be shut down and some 400,000 tons of valuable raw materials
were lost,'' the agency said.
   Tass quoted L. Roketsky, chairman of the Tyumen executive
committee, as blaming the accidents on slipshod construction and
sloppy maintenance.
   ``We saved by not building standby lines, took no care to build
roads, and did not properly repair pipelines,'' Roketsky was quoted
as saying. ``And who will calculate the cost of spills, pollution
of rivers and land?''

   Military officials believe the reserve pilot
who stole an air force plane committed suicide by crashing into the
Mediterranean, but have not ruled out the possibility that he
defected to an Arab country, newspapers said today.
   A military spokesman said no trace of the plane or pilot has
been found despite three days of the most widespread land, sea and
air search ever conducted by Israel's armed forces.
   The pilot, a 33-year captain in the reserves, took off in the
twin-engine Dornier-28 aircraft before dawn Friday.
   It was the first time an Israeli air force plane was stolen.
   Newspapers said today the air force has not ruled out the
possibility the pilot had defected to a neighboring Arab country.
   The Jerusalem Post said the plane could have made it to the
friendly nations of Cyprus or Turkey, but that authorities there
said the plane had not been seen.
   The army waited until late Saturday night to publicize the
incident. The missing West German-made aircraft is of a type often
used for reconnaissance. The military would not say whether it was
equipped with weapons.
   Military sources told the Israeli press authorities believe the
pilot flew out to sea until he ran out of gas and crashed.
   ``We believe (the incident) was connected to personal
problems,'' a military spokeswoman told The Associated Press. She
could not be named according to regulations.
   After taking off, the pilot reportedly flew over most of the
country and ``buzzed'' his house in the northern port city of
Haifa. The plane was last seen heading to the Israeli border with
Lebanon, the Maariv and Davar newspapers said.
   Newspapers identified the pilot by the name Captain H. and said
he was studying for a doctorate in physics at Technion, a
prestigious scientific institute in Haifa. They said he had been
having maritial problems and was not living with his wife.
   ``H. was a strange guy who wasn't accepted by society,'' a
friend of the pilot told the Al Hamishmar newspaper.
   Senior military officers told Al Hamishmar they will take steps
to prevent a recurrence of the incident.

<HEAD>Hollywood Freeway Partially Opens To Traffic After Subway Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Repair crews working round-the-clock enabled
authorities to reopen a small segment of a key downtown freeway for
weekday commuters, transportation officials said today.
   One regular lane of the Hollywood Freeway and a temporary lane
on the shoulder opened for northbound traffic at 6:10 a.m., said
Stephanie Brady, a county transportation comission spokesman.
   A 1{-mile section of the 10-lane highway had been closed since
Friday, when an intense fire burned out a subway tunnel being built
under the highway just east of downtown.
   By 6 a.m. today, workers had used steel and wooden braces to
shore up about 152 feet inside a 17-foot-diameter tunnel, Ms. Brady
said.
   ``They were able to make more progress overnight than
anticipated and will continue working around the clock, with 25-man
crews, until the work under the freeway is completed,'' she said.
``Their primary objective at this time is to enable Caltrans to
open the freeway lanes.''
   ``This is a fix-as-you-go effort,'' said Edward McSpedon,
president of Rail Construction Corp., which has supervised the
tunnel repair effort.
   All five southbound lanes of the Hollywood Freeway would remain
closed until further notice, Caltrans officials said Sunday. And on
the lanes that were reopened, trucks will be prohibited, the agency
said.
   State transportation officials closed the freeway because they
feared it could collapse into the tunnel.
   More than 250,000 vehicles travel the highway daily. CalTrans
officials advised motorists to leave early, use car pools or take
the bus during the week. Buses run on a separate elevated roadway
that parallels the freeway and was not affected by the fire.
   Damage to the $10 million tunnel was estimated at $2.5 million
to $5 million, said Southern California Rapid Transit District
officials.

   Sheriff's deputies picked up a protester
and carried her away today from the construction site of a museum
at the small motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was murdered.
   Jacqueline Smith has camped in front of the Lorraine Motel for
two years to protest the construction project and had defied a
judge's order to move.
   Two deputies picked her up from a lawn chair this morning and
moved her bodily from her campsite to a sidewalk across the street.
She offered no resistance and did not appear to say anything as she
was being moved.
   Then workmen from the construction project began moving her
belongings into the street.
   Ms. Smith, 39, a former worker and resident of the motel, is
protesting the decision to remodel it into a museum in honor of
King, who was assassinated in 1968. She wants it to be used to
serve the poor instead, saying King's memory and ``this sacred
ground is being exploited.''
   She also complains that the museum is part of an overall
movement to upgrade housing and raise rents in the generally
low-income neighborhood.
   ``It is my right and any other poor person's right to remain in
this area,'' she said today.
   When the motel was closed two years ago, deputies had to evict
her then, too.
   Tom Marshall, a deputy chief with the Shelby County Sheriff's
Department, said his officers did not arrest Ms. Smith this morning.
   ``We're enforcing a court order,'' Marshall said. He said it
would be up to the city to deal with her tent and other belongings
left in the small side street in front of the motel.
   Ms. Smith said she did not know if she would continue her
protest from the location across the street.
   ``I just don't know,'' she said. ``It's been a shock.''
   On Friday, a judge had set a deadline of Saturday for Ms. Smith
to move, saying she was trespassing on a construction site. But
authorities decided to take no action over the weekend.
   The Lorraine was shut by the state in January 1988 to make way
for the museum project. Sheriff's deputies evicted Ms. Smith two
months later. The deputies deposited her on a sidewalk outside the
motel, where she set up a tent and remained.
   Work on the museum site got under way last year, but authorities
generally ignored Ms. Smith until now. Anthony Vaccaro, project
manager for Jameson-Vaccaro Construction Co., said she was camped
on a spot that must be torn up for utility lines, and the company
petitioned the court to have her moved.
   This morning, Ms. Smith was surrounded by about a dozen
supporters when sheriff's deputies arrived. None was arrested and
there were no confrontations.
   There were about 50 onlookers.
   The Lorraine was a popular stopping place for blacks when
Memphis hotels were segregated, but it was falling apart in 1982
when a group of citizens bought it at foreclosure auction.
   The group formed the Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation and
spent the next several years persuading the state, county and city
governments to build the $9 million museum. Title to the property
was turned over to the state.
   The museum, to be called the National Civil Rights Center, is
scheduled to open July 4, 1991.

   Four people formed a human chain by
gripping each other's ankles to save a neighbor trapped in his
burning house.
   Three neighbors and a motorist lay on their stomachs and crawled
into the home of Morris Fondaw after spotting flames Saturday night.
   ``The guy was yelling for help, `I'm here! I'm here!','' said
Kenneth Cassibo, who led the chain into the house.
   Cassibo was forced to momentarily break the chain to reach the
last few feet and find the 63-year-old man. Then the group backed
out of the house.
   Jeannie Bauers, another neighbor who helped form the chain, said
Fondaw said he had fallen asleep while smoking in bed and got lost
in the heat and smoke trying to escape. Fondaw's wife, Margaret,
said her husband was treated for smoke inhalation. No one else was
injured.
   Mrs. Bauers said she didn't consider herself a hero.
   ``I always figure if something like that happened to me, I'd
have neighbors to help me,'' she said.
   Cheboygan is on Lake Huron near the northern tip of Michigan's
Lower Peninsula.

   Shots fired from passing cars into a
crowd at an oudoor taco wagon killed two men and wounded 12,
authorities said.
   The gunfire early Sunday sent people running, some of them
scaling barbed wire fences, others hiding behind and under parked
cars, witnesses said.
   ``I didn't have time to get scared,'' said Jesus Sanchez, who
was eating at the outdoor stand when he was hit in the abdomen.
   ``I felt something hot in my side. I reached down and I saw my
hand covered in my blood. But I hid under a car until the firing
stopped,'' Sanchez said through an interpreter.
   Three men were arrested, and police were looking for other
suspects in the shooting in this northern California city.
   ``There was some type of an altercation between some men over a
young lady,'' said police Sgt. Edward Williams. ``Some of the
fellows left and then subsequently returned with additional people,
armed with what we believe at this time was a shotgun and a couple
of rifles, and started firing on the people in the parking lot.''
   The dead were identified as James Guiterez Perez, 19, and
Leobardo Barajas, 18.
   Police Sgt. Patrick O'Hern said today that one of the 12 injured
people was hospitalized in critical condition. Four were in stable
condition and three in serious condition; the others were treated
and released.
   Witneses said the assailants drove by in three cars and opened
fire on the crowd, many of them customers of the taco wagon outside
a liquor store.
   ``Everybody just started hiding and running,'' said Jeff Jones.

<TEXT>
   The crews of the Soviet and American spacecraft
that linked in orbit 15 years ago say that only now are they
beginning to see the cooperation on research they expected after
their historic mission.
   ``I would have hoped we'd see some changes happening sooner than
this. But it's very positive now,'' said Donald ``Deke'' Slayton,
pilot of the docking module that linked the Apollo and Soyuz ships
on July 15, 1975.
   Slayton and others who served on the 1975 mission predicted
Sunday that warming U.S.-Soviet relations will help the two
countries work together to put man on Mars within 20 years.
   ``The two most notable times in relations between these two
countries were World War II and the Apollo-Soyuz mission,'' said
retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas Stafford, 59.
   Thomas and Slayton were on hand at a Seattle air show to
commemorate the mission anniversary, along with Soyuz commander
Alexei Leonov and Soviet crew member Valeriy Kubasov. The four are
currently touring the United States.
   Leonov said he was disappointed by what happened after the
mission.
   ``We finished our joint program perfectly, and Mr. (President)
Ford said we are ready to have our cooperation,'' he said. ``I
don't know why, but President Carter broke our programs. It was
very bad for relations between our country and America.''
   Thomas pointed out that the freeze in joint programs occurred
after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   Leonov said he has high hopes for a joint Mars program, and said
a joint program may be the only way to reach the planet.
   ``If America will do Mars alone it will be very expensive. If
the Soviet Union will do it alone, also. We are going to work
together because the Soviet Union and America have very good
results,'' he said.
   Slayton said a U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is ``inevitable. It's
just a matter of when. We're probably 15 or 20 years away from that
because of resources. But it will be a major international
venture.''
   Slayton said the Soviet and American crew members have met many
times since their 1975 orbital flight.
   The third Apollo mission member, command-module pilot Vance
Brand, 59, was unable to attend Sunday's meeting. He is preparing
to command the space shuttle Columbia's next mission.

<HEAD>Japan Repays its Last World Bank Loan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan, which has moved from the second-largest
World Bank loan debtor to the world's largest creditor nation,
repaid its last World Bank loan today.
   The last $7 million installment on a 25-year, $75 million loan
to the Japan Highway Public Corp. was paid, said World Bank
spokeswoman Keiko Sato.
   Between 1953 and 1966, Japan borrowed $862.9 million from the
World Bank to finance 31 projects. Only India borrowed more money
from the World Bank at that time.
   The loans financed the construction of power plants, steel mills
and other development projects.
   ``The World Bank provided money during Japan's roughest times,''
said Seiichiro Yonekura, professor of business history at
Hitotsubashi University.
   ``Without its help, Japan's postwar recovery would have been
inconceivable.'' The bank's strict scrutiny over borrowers also
forced Japanese companies to improve their management and
accounting practices, Yonekura said.
   In a statement released by the World Bank, J. Burke Knapp,
chairman of the bank's loan committee during the 1950s and 1960s,
said ``there was considerable skepticism in the bank regarding
Japan's economic viability and creditworthiness.''
   When the bank awarded its first loans to Japan, the economy was
``in an almost primitive condition, barely recovered from the
ravages of war, and struggling with seemingly intractable
balance-of-payments problems,'' he said.
   But Burke Knapp added that when Japan stopped borrowing from the
World Bank in 1966, ``the World Bank too had cause to regret the
termination, since for many years we had been saying that every
loan we made to Japan improved the quality of our general
portfolio.''
   Japan is now the second largest contributor after the United
States to the international loan institution, bearing 6.69 percent
of its total shares. The bank also borrows up to one-third of its
finances from the Tokyo money market.
   The United States lost its position as world's largest creditor
nation to Japan in the early 1980s. By 1985, the United States was
a net debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   In 1989 the United States tightened its grip on the title of
world's largest debtor by ending the year with a net debt of $663.7
billion, up 25 percent from the previous year.

   A man who allowed his 13-year-old niece to
drive a car while he helped steer, only to have it plunge into a
rain-swollen creek, died today, bringing the toll from the weekend
accident to five, a hospital official said.
   Donald Duncan, 27, who was pulled from Pequea Creek late
Saturday, died at Lancaster General Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   His niece, Heather Cunrod, the only survivor of the accident,
was in fair condition today. The other four victims were children
age 3 to 7.
   Heather was behind the wheel and Duncan was in the passenger
seat when the car overshot a parking lot and went into the creek,
police said.
   Conestoga Township police Samuel S. Goss said the girl told him
Duncan had offered to let her drive and she had gone about two
miles when the accident happened after they turned into a parking
lot.
   ``There was no way they could have stopped, even if she jammed
on the brakes,'' he said.
   ``The car carried 40 feet into the water,'' he said. ``It was
doing 40, 45 mph, even faster _ it just sailed like a boat.''
   Heather managed to escape the sinking car, but people at a
nearby boat club were unable to rescue the others.
   ``We did our best, we tried,'' said Bruce Kline, 28, a
steelworker who operated the winch that pulled the car toward
shore. He estimated that Duncan and the children were under water
for 20 minutes.
   Heather was already on shore, he said, adding: ``She was
flipping out. I don't remember what she said, just that there's
guys and kids in the car.''
   The younger victims were identified as Heather's 7-year-old
sister, Jennifer, and 3-year-old brother, Timothy, and Duncan's
3-year-old son, Donald, and 6-year-old daughter, Jessica.

   Protesters eager to shut down the Top Dog
World Championship Prairie Dog Shoot instead helped make it a
booming business success _ and all the hubbub may have made the
curious critters easier to kill.
   Locals thanked animal rights protesters for publicizing the
event that kept cash registers ringing as more than 100 shooters,
about five dozen reporters and hundreds of partying visitors
descended on this rural ranching area.
   ``They didn't mean to do it, but they did us more good than
anything that's been done around here in years,'' said Beulah
Colcord, owner of the Yellow Rock Cafe, the area's social center in
nearby Naturita.
   An animal advocate appalled at the killing of prairie dogs for
sport and $7,000 in prizes said prior to the shoot that 5,000
protesters would disrupt the weekend event, but no more than two
dozen showed up.
   The two-day prairie dog death toll was 2,956, with local rancher
Earl Reams and partner Rusty Calhoun claiming top dog honors with
112 kills between them.
   Reams said New York can have Broadway. He prefers more rustic
diversions. ``Some places have theaters, we have turkey shoots,''
he said. ``This is good for the town and now we're on the map.''
   Protesters hooting and blowing whistles in hopes of keeping the
targeted rodents inside their burrows during the shooting actually
hurt the curious animals' chances of surviving, participants said.
   ``All their noise does is bring the prairie dogs out of their
holes to see what's doing on,'' said Terrye Logan, 32, of Clyde,
Texas, one of three women competing in the event. ``My brothers
yesterday ended up laughing so hard they had to put their guns
down.''
   A 25-man special sheriff's force was on patrol. There were a
number of verbal confrontations but no fistfights. Two protesters
were cited for trespassing.
   Nucla Mayor John Vanderpool, who wore a flak jacket all weekend
after receiving death threats, said local merchants reported
``everything has at least tripled'' because of the prairie dog
shoot.
   Organizer Mike Mehew said he'd be writing thank-you notes today
to Robin Duxbury of the Rocky Mountain Humane Society, Gov. Roy
Romer and U.S. Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell ``because they really
made this what it turned out to be.''
   Duxbury had promised to deliver 5,000 protesters to the event,
but was not even among the small number that showed up.
   Romer and Campbell said they understood that ranchers need to
control prairie dogs to protect livestock and prevent soil erosion,
but criticized the shoot that turned rodent control into a
spectacle.
   The Moose Lodge in Nucla, headquarters of the hunt, reported
skyrocketing revenue. Bar receipts for the week hit $22,000,
compared with $800 normally tallied each week, lodge administrator
Leo Laremore said.
   The Yellow Rock Cafe did even better, Colcord said.
   ``We did enough in four days to double what we do in an entire
(big game) hunting season,'' she said. ``And we couldn't be happier
with the protesters. They made the publicity that brought all these
people in here.''
   Reams and Calhoun won two top-of-the line Kimber rifles after
the event that awarded more points for long-distance kills and
deducted points for missed short-range shots.
   The shooters' pace was deliberate and careful, with a shot
coming about once every five minutes when a prairie dog poked his
head into the air. Four hunters were stationed at each ranch and
each was allowed 50 shots a day.
   Only four local shooters were entered in the 106-shooter field,
which drew hunters from California to North Carolina.
   Three young protesters were all that remained Sunday of the
larger band of demonstrators operating the day before.
   ``If nothing else, we're bothering the mighty hunters,'' said
Jon Ellenbogen, 24, who moved from Detroit to Durango three months
ago. ``I don't take their arguments about damage from prairie dogs.
If the prairie dogs are ruining it for the cows, don't raise cows.
Shooting them is not much of a philosophy.''

   Building cooperation with Canadian neighbors,
water management and the handling of nuclear and other hazardous
aste top the agenda at the annual meeting of the Western Governors'
Association today.
   Governors from 12 western states and American Samoa are
attending.
   This morning, South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson was formally
elected chairman of the group. He will succeed North Dakota Gov.
George Sinner at the end of the annual meeting Tuesday. Wyoming
Gov. Michael Sullivan was elected vice chairman.
   For the first time, Canadian officials were invited to attend
the governors' gathering. Premiers Grant Devine of Saskatchewan and
Gary Filmon of Manitoba were scheduled to attend sessions later
today, and representatives from Alberta and British Columbia also
were expected to meet with state leaders.
   Sinner said Sunday that he hoped the meeting would lead to
regular discussions between U.S. state leaders and their Canadian
counterparts.
   Sinner wants to promote closer ties with western Canada, but he
says it is premature for the association to consider making
Canadian premiers members of the organization.
   Water management, hazardous waste and nuclear waste disposal and
state-tribal relations are other prominent agenda topics.
   On Tuesday, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and W. Henson Moore,
a deputy U.S. energy secretary, will meet with the governors to
discuss issues of mutual interest to western states and the federal
government.
   The governors of Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington,
Wyoming and American Samoa are attending the conference.

   A U.N. report declared today that South
Africa is beginning to dismantle apartheid and ``has reached the
threshold of a new era'' of nonracial democracy.
   Introducing the report, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar praised South African President F.W. de Klerk for his
``bold and courageous'' policy of dismantling apartheid and also
lauded black leaders for ``vision and forbearance.''
   The report was prepared by a U.N. team that traveled to South
Africa.
   Perez de Cuellar said he was ``greatly encouraged by the
positive developments'' in South Africa this year.
   He added, however, the process of dismantling the apartheid
system of racial segregation was still at an early stage and
emphasized the system has inflicted grave social injustice on the
majority black population.
   Perez de Cuellar, in an apparent reference to both blacks and
whites, cited ``the urgent requirement to end the violence.''
   In December, the General Assembly convened a special session
that called on South Africa to negotiate an end to apartheid and
transform their country into a nonracial democracy.
   It also called upon the secretary-general to make a report on
progress in ending apartheid.
   Perez de Cuellar dispatched a team to South Africa from June 9
to 19, led by Abdulrahim A. Farah, undersecretary-general for
special political questions. The team met government officials,
opposition and black leaders and gathered information on steps to
end apartheid.
   ``South Africa has reached the threshold of a new era,'' Farah
said in his report. ``The political process on which it has
embarked holds encouraging prospsects of leading to the
dismantlement of apartheid.''
   But he added, ``So long as racial attitudes persist and
apartheid structures at the local level remain, the process for
change will encounter difficulties.''
   Perez de Cuellar cited steps taken by the de Klerk government,
including lifting a ban on political parties and movements. The
national state of emergency has been lifted in all but Natal
Province.
   ``While it is evident that an important process has been set in
motion,'' he said, ``many believe that the government should
implement all measures in their totality to create the appropriate
atmosphere.''

   China needs 10 million tons of additional water
each day to meet the needs of 300 major cities that are facing
serious water shortages, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Monday.
   Last year, China lost $2.6 billion worth of industrial output
due to water shortages in 94 cities in five provinces, according to
Wang Guangtao, director of the Construction Ministry's urban
construction department.
   China's per capita water supply is only one-fourth the world
level because of pollution, shortage of water supply facilities and
huge long-term waste caused by the low price for tap water set by
the state, Wang said.
   In the past seven years, China has spent $1.7 billion on water
supply projects, increasing capacity by 20 million tons a day, he
said.
   Each summer, residents of major cities like Beijing and Shanghai
are urged to control their water consumption. The demand can be so
large that at times no water is available in parts of the city.

   Sikh extremists barged into the house of
a Sikh policeman Monday and killed his four brothers and four other
relatives, police said.
   Senior police superintendent Anil Sharma said the shootings
occurred in Trindi village, 55 miles east of Amritsar, the
stronghold of Sikh militants fighting for a separate homeland in
the state of Punjab.
   Six to eight gunmen came to constable Kashmira Singh's house
early Monday and asked for the policeman, Sharma said.
   When told by one of Singh's brothers that he was in a
neighboring village, the extremists fired their automatic weapons
in the courtyard, killing the eight people.
   The extremists came in a jeep and fled after the killings, he
said.
   The reason for the killings was not immediately clear, but the
extremists have been increasingly targeting policemen and their
families in their 8-year-old campaign for independence.
   At least 1,391 people have been killed by the extremists this
year.
   Extremists among the Sikh community claim cultural and political
discrimination by the Hindu-dominated government. Sikhs are in a
slight majority in Punjab, but nationwide they comprise 2 percent
of India's 880 million people. Hindus account for 82 percent.

   Water polluted by farming chemicals
spilled into aquaculture basins over the weekend, killing about
60,000 young trout, fish farmers said Monday.
   The water, used to clean a piece of farming equipment, was
apparently tainted by chemicals used to raise potatoes, the fish
farmers said.
   The run-off reached a stream feeding the fish-raising basins and
poisoned the 7- to 8-month-old trout, the fish farmers said,
estimating the cost at 18 cents per fish. That would make the total
loss more than $1 million.
   The Breton Trout Association has demanded a meeting with
regional authorities in western Brittany to complain about what it
claims is frequent river pollution by farmers.

   Treasury officers checked out 217 yachts anchored in the Bay of

   The High Court on Monday sentenced
three men to death for trafficking in 37.8 ounces of cannabis.
   Judge James Foong held that Zainudin Baharudin 30, Zawawi
Zainon, 24, and his brother, Zakaria Zainon, 29, had custody and
knowledge of the drug, which police found in a room rented by
Zawawi.
   Mere possession of more than 3.53 ounces of cannabis, often used
to make marijuana or hashish, is deemed to be trafficking under
Malaysian law. No sale need be proved.
   Since parliament passed laws in 1975 allowing the death sentence
for drug trafficking, 256 people have been sentenced to death. Of
these, 92 have been hanged.
   It was not known yet if the three would appeal to the supreme

   Wanted by the Czech Ministry of
Justice: Vaclav Havel.
   For at least one bureaucrat within the ministry, Havel remains
the shady enemy of the state and former convict instead of
Czechoslovak president.
   The daily Mlada Fronta on Monday carried the facsimile of a
request from the Ministry of Justice to the criminal department of
Prague police on the ``whereabouts of a Vaclav Havel, born Oct. 5,
1936.''
   The suspect ``moved without notifying the authorities,'' the
daily quoted the request, dated May 2, as saying.
   Havel was jailed for 4{ years by Communists during the 20 years
he acted as a human rights activist and dissident under
Czechoslovakia's harsh Communist regime.
   He was under permanent watch of the secret police until last
year's democratic changes resulted in his election as president.
   The ministry inquiry appeared not only out of date but based on
inaccurate information as well.
   Unlike his predecessors, Havel, who starts serving his second
term as president on July 5, still formally lives in his private
apartment in downtown Prague, although he spends much of his time
at the presidential residence in Lany, near Prague, and his country
house at Hradecek in northern Bohemia.

   Robbers raiding a train in Cambodia
killed more than 100 passengers, the country's official SPK news
agency said Monday.
   The report quoted the defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, who
mentioned the raid at a news conference in Phnom Penh on Saturday.
He had been speaking about the war against guerrillas opposing his
Vietnamese-installed government.
   He said the railway sometimes was raided at vulnerable points in
Kampot province. In the recent attack in its Kompong Trach
district, he said, ``the robbers killed more than 100 passengers
and robbed their property and foodstuff.''
   The report did not say whether Banh identified the assailants,
and it was impossible to confirm the report. Previous claims by the
Communist government have been exaggerated.
   The most active guerrilla group in Kampot has been the Khmer
Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of people while ruling
Cambodia from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978 and installed
the current government.
   The Khmer Rouge is allied with the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.

   Chinese and Canadian scientists have found what
they believe may be the largest dinosaur fossils in the world, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
   The discovery last month of the remains of a dinosaur believed
to have been 99 feet long was made in northwest China's Gobi desert
by members of the Sino-Canadian Dinosaur Project, the report said.
   The fossils, including a complete skull and 10 pieces of
cervical vertebrae, were found in the Junggar basin in the Xinjiang
Autonomous Region, it said.
   Chinese paleontologist Dong Zhiming said the remains date back
140 million years and are believed to be the largest found in Asia
and possibly the world.
   The fossils have been shipped to Beijing for laboratory
analysis, Xinhua said. The report did not say what kind of dinosaur
it was believed to be.
   The Dinosaur Project, begun in 1986, involves experts from the
two fossil-rich countries of Canada and China who have made three
large expeditions into the Gobi desert.
   Their dinosaur and other fossil discoveries, including 12 major
dinosaur skeletons, will be part of a traveling exhibit to 12
cities around the world scheduled for 1992.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When a lightning bolt
sent flames crackling from a cottonwood tree in Yellowstone
National Park, half a dozen firefighters responded within minutes.
   They were too late; the fire had been reduced to embers by heavy
rain from the storm that got it going. But ever since blazes
blackened nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres during the
dry, hot summer of 1988, even a single burning tree quickly draws
firefighters' attention.
   The heavily criticized ``let it burn'' plan under which fires
caused by nature were left untouched unless they endangered people
or structures has been suspended and is under review.
   This year, firefighters have fought about a dozen fires, most of
which were a quarter-acre or smaller and several of which involved
just one tree.
   The park's 13th lightning fire, which had blackened 15 acres
north of Yellowstone Lake, was 95 percent contained by fire lines
today, and 13 firefighters were at work, down from a peak of 82,
said park spokeswoman Marsha Karle.
   The costs are high. The summer's biggest fire, spotted July 5
near Yellowstone River, was contained at 220 acres by 315
firefighters, and the bill is expected to be around $750,000, said
park spokesman Marsha Karle.
   ``When we have a big one where we bring in overhead and we bring
in outside crews, that's where it adds up real quick,'' she said.
``Any time you call in outside resources _ retardant drops,
smokejumpers, helicopters, crews _ it adds to the cost.
Firefighting is an expensive business.''
   At the height of the 1988 blazes, public and political outrage
prompted the Interior Department to go back to its pre-1972 policy
of fighting all fires.
   The agency also mobilized a U.S. Forest Service-National Park
Service team to analyze the ``let it burn'' policy. The team found
the policy to be basically sound but asked for some refinements.
   Steve Frye, a park ranger, said the proposed revisions, if
adopted, will leave little room for guesswork when rangers decide
which backcountry fires to fight.
   Rangers would have to take into account recent rainfall,
humidity, fuel moisture, wind speed, fuel types and the slope of
the forest floor when deciding whether to fight fires, Frye said.
   These factors have been considered in the past, but there were
no predetermined limits that they had to fall within, he said.
   It wasn't always so complicated.
   During the park's first 100 years, rangers battled every fire
they could reach.
   Then in 1972, the National Park Service agreed to manage natural
areas of Yellowstone as ``vignettes of primitive America'' and
adopted the ``let it burn'' policy.
   From 1972 to 1987, the policy guided action over 235 fires that
burned roughly 34,000 acres, according to park records.
   How soon the park's firefighters will be given leeway in
deciding which fires to fight, and which to leave alone, is
difficult to gauge, Frye said.
   ``Our fire management plan is in the regional forester's office
for review at this point,'' he said.
   If an environmental assessment of the revisions is required, the
plan may not take effect until next summer, Frye said. An
environmental impact statement would require even more study, he
said.

   Education reform efforts that have swept the

the head of a civil rights group said today.
   Raul Yzaguirre, director of the National Council of La Raza,
said Hispanics remain the most undereducated segment of the U.S.

   ``The problem is getting worse rather than better,'' Yzaguirre

cases, the gap between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in test
achievement scores was growing.
   Yzaguirre said the group is worried that education reform
efforts are helping whites, but hurting minorities.
   He compared some education reforms to a track coach who raises
the bar on the high jump and does nothing to train his athletes to
leap higher.
   ``What that means is those who have had the training, the
preparation, the nutrition will jump higher than those who have
not,'' he said.
   ``That's exactly what we fear will happen to the Hispanic
community.''
   President Bush and Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos are
scheduled to address the meeting later this week.
   Yzaguirre said the group does not expect Bush to announce any
new policy initiative to cope with the problem.
   Hispanics, compared with blacks and whites, enter school later
and leave it earlier. They are also less likely to complete high
school, enter or complete college, the NCLR report said.
   Hispanics have more problems in school and have lower
expectations, sometimes because teachers expect less from them,
Yzaguirre said.
   ``We have to understand this problem as the system's failure,
not a failure of children,'' Yzaguirre said.
   NCLR is a Washington-based non-profit advocacy group for the
nation's 20 million Hispanic citizens. It has a field office in
McAllen, Texas.

   Ted Vagelos figured the proper way to
pop the question to an editor's daughter was in print.
   So he decided to take out a quarter-page advertisement in
Sunday's editions of The Knoxville News-Sentinel newspaper.
   ``Dear Tina, Will you marry me? Love, Ted,'' the $1,274 ad asked
in big bold letters.
   The proposal surprised Tina Moskos and her father, Editor Harry
Moskos, whose 28th wedding anniversary with his wife, Victoria
Marie, happened to be Sunday.
   Ms. Moskos accepted.
   Vagelos, an American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. consultant in
Nashville, and Ms. Moskos, a Vanderbilt University nursing graduate
student, will be married in Knoxville early next year.

   Never mind that nonsense about why
chickens cross the road. In this eastern Texas city two ducks and
two geese cross the street every day to get from their hotel to a
fountain.
   About 5 p.m., a manager from The Fredonia escorts the birds
safely through traffic.
   The daily procession has quickly become a popular attraction for
hotel guests.
   ``It's getting to where they'll wait in the lobby,'' said
general manager Jim Boiles. ``They get the biggest bang out of it.''
   Although motorists are sometimes stopped in their tracks, they
don't seem to mind. Often, they wave at the waddling procession.
   The four birds came to the hotel as temporary guests, part of a
petting zoo for the Easter season.
   The geese, Pate and Jimbo, and ducks, Snip and Snap, arrived
when they were only a few days old.
   ``The customers really wanted us to keep them,'' said Cafe
Fredonia manager and ``duck mom'' Donna Crabtree. She said it
didn't take much to persuade Boiles to let the birds stay. They got
a luxurious home next to the lobby.
   She's the one who trained the birds for their street-crossing
routine.
   ``It's grown to be such a tradition,'' Ms. Crabtree said.

   The change from communism to democracy
has made sex a growth industry in Hungary. Red lights now glitter
where red stars once shone brightly.
   Budapest kiosks feature at least a dozen sex magazines. A
pornography shop joint venture with Austria opened downtown six
months ago. In June, the city got its first peep show. A cab
company ferries passengers exclusively to its massage salon.
   The explosion in Hungary's sex industry began after censorship
laws were repealed last year as the nation moved from Communist
rule to democracy. This paved the way for hardcore pornography,
which remains unrestricted in the absence of any new press law.
   King of Budapest's new trade in bodily pleasures is Antal Laszlo
Voeroes, a 37-year-old travel journalist turned nude photographer
and now sex and porn entrepreneur.
   Sitting in a swing chair in his garden, barking explicit
instructions to a photographer over a cordless phone, Voeroes
explained how he struck it rich.
   Last summer, Voeroes launched ``Sexy Lady,'' a 24-page,
explicitly pornographic magazine selling for 90 cents an issue. The
initial print run of 60,000 has soared to 1 million copies a month.
   A follow-up, ``Sexy Man,'' was a flop. But two new publications
with lewd English and German language titles, designed to boost
foreign sales and give the allure of the west to Hungarians, are
doing well, Voeroes said.
   He hopes to break into the new Yugoslav and Romanian markets
this summer.
   Voeroes' starting capital of $16,700 came from profits on girlie
calendars and what he calls a photo model school, where he says had
trained some 1,400 girls by 1988.
   Taking that capital and $585,000 raised from non-banking sources
he refuses to reveal, Voeroes established his present company,
Intermozaik, in May 1989.
   Besides the lucrative magazines, the company also makes
pornographic videos that are also sold in Austria and Poland, and
is an agent for girls to Italian and West German movie makers,
Voeroes said.
   Not everyone is happy with Voeroes' new-found freedom.
   Anti-porn campaigners have complained that Hungary is fast
becoming the ``Thailand of central Europe.''
   Roman Catholic church leaders, who are campaigning to get
religion back into schools and restrict abortion, are pressing for
restrictions on the growing sex industry.
   But after 45 years of censorhip under Communist rule not even
leading anti-pornography campaigner Pal Becker, head of the
Catholic Youth Movement, wants pornography banned.
   He has, however, argued that it should be restricted to the
``narrowest circles'' well outside the center of Budapest.
   Like a good capitalist, Voeroes is constantly reinvesting and
expanding his sex empire.
   On June 15, his nudist cruise boat took its maiden voyage on
Lake Balaton. Daytime trips, strictly for sunbathing, cost $8 and
$5.50 for children.
   Evening sex cruises, advertised as ``live show, sex games, video
and nudist disco,'' cost $50 or $108 with a sex massage thrown in.
   Business is so brisk that Voeroes plans to have a second boat
cruising the lake, Hungary's most popular foreign tourist spot.
   In a country where the average wage is $135 a month, Voeroes
doesn't seem to have difficulty finding masseuses who earn $25 a
client, or a couple to perform live sex for double that amount.
   Parliament, which was democratically elected earlier this year,
has not legalized prostitution, stalling Voeroes' plans for two
brothels, 50 cabs driven by girls available for more than a ride,
and buses cruising round Lake Balaton with five girls aboard.
   At Intermozaik headquarters, not everybody is as explicit as the
magazines, calendars and posters surrounding them.
   Both secretaries answering phones that constantly ring with
demands for pornography declined to give their names, and said
their families don't know where they work.
   ``We take home a lot more than at our previous jobs,'' one said
defensively. ``After all, filling out invoices for `Sexy Lady' is
no different than filling out invoices for anything else.''

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh won a power
struggle with his deputy Monday, ending a crisis which had
paralyzed his minority government for three days.
   Singh's victory came with the resignation of Deputy Prime
Minister Devi Lal's son, Om Prakash Chautala, as head of the
government of Haryana state, five days after he was reinstalled by
his father.
   Chautala was forced to quit the post in May after 12 people died
in repeated election violence in his constituency. Chautala's
supporters were accused of inciting the troubles, but a promised
inquiry into his role never began.
   Chautala's re-appointment Thursday, which prompted 13 ministers
to resign in Singh's 38-member Cabinet, was seen as an effort by
Devi Lal to promote his son's political career.
   ``The crisis has blown over,'' Somappa Rayappa Bommai, president
of the Janata Dal Party, announced at a news conference late Monday.
   ``Chautala resigned at my request to improve the image of the
government and the party. I congratulate him. He has risen to the
occasion,'' Bommai said.
   The crisis began Friday when three Cabinet ministers resigned.
Ten more ministers resigned after that, and on Saturday, Singh also
offered to quit. The National Front rejected the offer.
   Top leaders of the alliance rallied behind Singh, forcing him to
retract his resignation letter. Some commentators suggested the
maneuver was meant to garner support in his fight with Devi Lal,
the 75-year-old political patriarch of Haryana state.
   Several major newspapers had been demanding Chautala's ouster as
a solution to the crisis. ``If you bow to Mr. Devi Lal today, you
will have to crawl tomorrow,'' wrote the conservative Hindustan
Times in an editorial.
   Singh led the front in ousting Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party in
November's national elections, campaigning on a platform of a clean
government.
   Neither party got a majority of the seats in Parliament, but the
National Front formed the government on the strength of outside
support by a right-wing Hindu fundamentalist party and left-wing
parties.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today removed his
objection to a united Germany belonging to NATO, saying Germany was
free to choose its allies. The Soviet objection had been a major
obstacle to full German unification.
   Gorbachev spoke at a joint news conference with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in southern Russia that was broadcast live
on Soviet and West German television.
   Kohl said West Germany wants to new unified state ``to be a
member of NATO.'' He said he was sure the government of East
Germany concurred.
   Gorbachev said that the four-power agreement of the victorious
World War II allies that has governed Germany since the end of the
war will cease when Germany is unified.
   `Unified Germany receives complete sovereignty,'' Gorbachev told
the news conference.
   ``It has the right to use this sovereignty to make its choice,
that is its internal choice, meaning its variant of social
development, and meaning what it would like to be a part of, what
blocs to support,'' he said.
   The two leaders spoke following a two-day vsiit by Kohl aimed at
removing Soviet concerns over German unification. The news
conference was held in Zhelosnovodsk, in southern Russia.
   Gorbachev said that no NATO forces must be stationed on the
territory of what is now East Germany during a period of three to
four years, when Soviet troops will be withdrawing.
   He said the Soviet Union hopes that after that period, no NATO
forces or nuclear weapons would be stationed there.
   Previously, the Soviets had insisted on a neutral Germany, and
recently had suggested a form of associate membership in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization after an unspecified transition period.
   West Germany and its NATO allies had insisted that a united
Germany be a part of the western alliance.
   In Washington, the State Department said Gorbachev's comments
were ``most interesting and welcome.'' But it withheld further
comment pending study of Gorbachev's remarks.
   NATO, in a statement from Brussels, also praised Gorbachev's
acceptance of a unified Germany as member of the Western alliance.
It said such membership ``will increase stability for all ...
including the Soviet Union.''
   Kohl and Gorbachev also announced agreement on several other
issues, including the size of the future army of a united Germany
and a timetable for the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from East
Germany.
   Gorbachev said the two sides, in talks that started Sunday in
Moscow and continued in Gorbachev's native Stavropol region, had
managed to ease each other's concerns about the future of Soviet
troops on the territory of what is now East Germany.
   Kohl said Soviet troops should be withdrawn from East German
territory three to four years after Germany is united. The Soviets
now have about 380,000 troops in East Germany.
   During the same period, the armed forces of a united Germany
will be reduced to 370,000 men, Kohl said. The combined strength of
the East and West German armed forces is now about 600,000, with
West Germany providing 480,000 men.
   Kohl said the rights of the four World War II victorious powers
will cease immediately after unification, but that their troops
could stay in Berlin as long as the Soviet troops are in East
Germany.
   He said a united Germany and the Soviet Union will sign a
comprehensive treaty that will govern all aspects of their
bilateral relations.
   The two leaders were in southern Russia after a visit Sunday to
Gorbachev's home region, Stavropol.
   The Soviet leader said he thought the ``fresh air'' of the
northern Caucasus mountains would help both leaders formulate their
thoughts clearly, the Tass news agency reported.
   It was Kohl's second visit to the Soviet Union since February
and Gorbachev's hospitality indicated the Soviets seek close ties
with the economically powerful Germans.
   Tass said parallel talks were held Sunday between Foreign
Ministers Eduard Shevardnadze and Hans Dietrich Genscher as well as
Finance Ministers Valentin Pavlov and Theo Waigel.
   During Kohl's visit, the two leaders discussed how West German
economic aid can help Gorbachev restructure _ and revive _ the
ailing Soviet economy.
   The West German government has backed a $3.1 billion loan to
support Gorbachev's efforts _ so far ineffectual _ to transform the
Soviet Union's centralized economy to a market-oriented system.
   At last week's Houston summit of leading industrial democracies,
Western leaders rejected a proposal strongly supported by West
Germany and France for a $15 billion aid plan to shore up the
Soviet economy and demonstrate Western support for Gorbachev.

   Aircraft maker McDonnell Douglas Corp. will cut
11 percent of its work force, or up to 17,000 jobs, by year's end
under a plan to reduce costs by more than $700 million, the company
said today.
   ``We tried to do everything else,'' John F. McDonnell, chairman
and chief executive officer, told a news conference. ``But in the
final analysis we had to come to this.''
   The company, the nation's biggest defense contractor, has been
struggling financially because of cutbacks in the defense industry
and costly development problems in both military and commercial
aircraft projects.
   The cost-cutting plan also includes reduced capital budgets,
significant cuts in budgets for travel, consultants and advertising
and restrictions on overtime.
   In a statement, McDonnell told employees he ``deeply regretted
the pain and hardship these cuts will cause to thousands of people
who have valued and dedicated employees.''
   Job fairs, resume services and counseling would be offered to
help laid-off workers find new jobs, McDonnell saidJ.
   The cuts had been expected for several weeks, since the company
announced plans for significant layoffs in an effort to cut
expenses and bolster its sagging financial performance.
   The company's stock was down $1.50 a share at $43.37{ in midday
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   McDonnell Douglas earned $2 million during its first quarter,
down 98 percent from a year earlier. The drop stemmed mainly from
huge losses at Douglas Aircraft, which primarily builds commercial
jets.
   The layoffs will affect salaried and hourly jobs at all of
McDonnell Douglas' companies and facilities.
   The news release said 4,500 jobs in St. Louis would be lost.
About 9,000 jobs will be lost, including about 8,000 at the Douglas
Aircraft Co. commercial airplane facility in Long Beach, Calif. An
additional 1,000 jobs are being eliminated in 25 other states where
the company has offices and manufacturing operations.
   McDonnell said he believed the company can make the cuts ``so
that they will not jeopardize our technological capability or
undermine our ability to deliver quality products on time.''

   A rebound in business sales in May helped keep
inventories growing at a moderate rate, the government said Monday
in a report that analysts say signals continued economic expansion.
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots totaled a seasonally adjusted $799.4 billion, up 0.4
percent after April's 0.3 percent gain.
   Business sales shot up a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent in May,
nearly recovering from a 1 percent drop a month earlier. It was the
strongest increase since February, when sales rose 1.4 percent.
   The report, which was in line with economists' expectations,
provided fresh evidence that the economy was not in danger of
toppling immediately into a recession.
   ``There's no excessive inventory building, so economic growth
can continue just fine,'' said economist John Silvia of Kemper
Financial Services in Chicago.
   The combination of strong sales and a moderate increase in
inventories produced a 1.48 ratio of inventories to sales, down
slightly from 1.49 in April. The ratio means that it would take
1.48 months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the May sales pace.
   ``Usually when the inventory-to-sales ratio ... gets high,
businesses cut down on production and that tends to generate a
recession,'' Silvia said.
   The ratio hit a peak of 1.7 in October 1982 during the last
recession.
   Although inventories appear well-controlled overall, some
analysts are worried that inventories rose more strongly on the
retail and wholesale levels.
   The increase in inventories was greatest at wholesale
establishments, up 1.2 percent. Retail backlogs rose 0.4 percent
while inventories at factories were unchanged.
   ``Retail and wholesale ... (are) where a cycle of rising
inventories would start and eventually work back to manufacturing.
... It seems to suggest the economy still has problems,'' said
economist Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International.
   Manufacturers showed the biggest sales gain in May, 2 percent,
while sales fell 0.6 percent at retail stores. Wholesalers reported
a 0.6 percent increase.
   In an advance estimate, the Commerce Department said last week
that retail sales rose 0.5 percent in June, the first increase in
five months.

   The Pentagon said today it is providing an Air
Force transport plane to carry civilian rescue workers, dogs and
support equipment to the Philippines to assist in the hunt for
earthquake survivors.
   Meanwhile, the State Department said it was checking into
unconfirmed reports that American government officials may have
been killed or injured in the quake that rocked Manila and
surrounding Luzon island today.
   Officials reported at least 44 people killed, most when a
six-story college building north of Manila collapsed during the
quake, registered at 7.7 on the Richter scale.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the department
was looking into a report that an Agency for International
Development conference was under way at a hotel in the badly
damaged resort city of Baguio when the quake struck.
   An official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
there was an unconfirmed report that one American attending the
conference in an official capacity was killed.
   Rene Bafalis, a spokeswoman for the AID office of disaster
relief, said she had no information on the report.
   Boucher said a U.S. Embassy team would fly to Baguio Tuesday
morning, Philippine time, to assist Americans.
   He said the U.S. ambassador in Manila, Nicholas Platt, had been
in touch with President Corazon Aquino and had committed $25,000
from his emergency fund as a first step in disaster relief.
   Boucher said there were no reports of injuries to private
American citizens in the Philippines.
   The Pentagon said it is providing an Air Force C-141 transport
plane to carry 16 civilian search and rescue personnel, plus four
dogs and support equipment to assist in the hunt for survivors.
   The rescue personnel are from Fairfax County, Va., and Dade
County, Fla. The plane was scheduled to leave from Andrews Air
Force Base, Md. later today.

   New members of the World Bear Eaters'
Association may feel like growling after getting their first taste
of the dark, greasy meat.
   ``But I tell them not to worry,'' said the Rev. Joseph Gluck,
pastor emeritus and historian of the Forks-of-Cheat Baptist Church.
``After that passes, they'll feel stronger, more powerful, with a
new zest for life.''
   The church, founded in the mountain wilderness 215 years ago,
marked its anniversary Sunday with a ``bear feast'' to honor the
animal that helped keep early members alive.
   ``It wasn't easy for the settlers to bring cows, sheep and other
domestic animals across the Allegheny Mountains,'' said Gluck.
``That's why the black bear became one of the great sources of meat
for the people who founded our church.''
   For the past 30 years, bear meat has been served ``as a sort of
memorial'' at the picnics marking the anniversary of the church's
founding on Nov. 5, 1775, Gluck said. The picnic is held in July to
take advantage of summer weather.
   The hilltop church, which overlooks the Cheat and Monongahela
rivers near the Pennsylvania line, depends on hunters to supply the
meat.
   Gluck, 75, is also ``Bear Master'' at the church and initiates
new members into the bear-eating club.
   ``I say some magic special Indian words, tap them on the head
three times with the magic tooth taken from a West Virginia black
bear and give them a certificate so they can prove to people
they've actually eaten bear,'' Gluck said. ``Mostly, they just grin
and eat it.''
   About 1,500 people from two dozen states and several other
countries are members, said Gluck.
   Lena Nicholson, 90, who has helped prepare the feast for
decades, said cooking the hind quarters takes all day.
   The meat is divided into roasts and boiled in water three times
before being covered with onion, apple and celery and roasted in
the oven for several hours, she said.
   ``That bear meat is awful strong and greasy,'' said Nicholson.
``I have to open all the windows and the door, the smell gets
pretty strong.''
   When it's done, the meat tastes like a cross between beef and
pork, she said.
   ``People seem to like it real well,'' said Nicholson. ``There's
never any left and I've never had anyone complain yet.''

   Two young men who shot themselves in 1985 were
influenced by subliminal messages in a rock 'n' roll album produced
in the interest of greed, an attorney charged today as a trial got
under way.
   ``What this case is, is about making money,'' Vivian Lynch said
in her opening statement in the case against the band Judas Priest
and CBS Records.
   ``Excitement is what the defendants were selling,'' she said.
``Excitement is what the consumers were buying.''
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Relatives of the victims
claim hidden messages in the album ``Stained Class'' spurred the
two men to form a suicide pact.
   The band members strongly deny any such messages exist.
   On the afternoon of Dec. 23, 1985, Raymond Belknap, 18, held a
sawed-off shotgun to his chin and died instantly from a single
blast. James Vance, 20, managed only to blow away the lower portion
of his face. The two had been listening to the album repeatedly
while drinking and smoking marijuana, their relatives said.
   Though he survived the shootings, Vance underwent repeated
operations and eventually died three years later of complications
from his injuries and a reaction to medication.
   Ms. Lynch, who represents Vance's family, told the court the
audience targeted by the band was a ``stained class'' in itself
that craved excitement and touted Satanism, sexual aggression,
violence, suicide and death.
   ``This case is about mind control. In this case, what pushed the
boys over the edge into eternity was the subliminal push.''
   Lawyers for Judas Priest and CBS Records will argue it was the
young men's troubled lives, including a history of drug and alcohol
abuse, psychiatric disorders and physical abuse, that pushed them
over the edge. They deny that the band promotes suicide or Satanism.
   Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead is presiding over the
non-jury trial. He already has denied a defense motion to dismiss
the case on grounds the record was protected by the First Amendment.
   Whitehead said freedom of speech protections would not apply to
subliminal messages. He said he was not convinced the hidden
messages actually existed on the album, but left the argument to
attorneys.
   The lawsuit is proceeding as a products liability case, with the
band and record company accused of negligence and intentional and
reckless misconduct.
   In one of the album's songs, ``Beyond the Realms of Death,'' the
band sings: ``Yeah, I have left the world behind. I am safe now in
my mind. I'm free to speak with my own mind. This is my life, this
is my life, and I'll decide, not you.''
   But the trial will focus not on what the lyrics may have
suggested, but whether there was a second, all-but-inaudible set of
lyrics in the background.
   ``I don't believe that we'd have had the support and following
that we've had for the past 17 years had we deliberately attempted
to contrive to create songs where people did harm to themselves,''
lead singer Robert Halford said in a 1988 deposition.
   Attorneys for the families said the young men's troubled lives
made them ``susceptible, influenced and vulnerable to the ideas,
suggestions and emotions'' allegedly hidden in the music.
   More than 100 witnesses are expected to testify during the trial
likely to last four weeks.

<HEAD>Navy Seeks College-Bound Sailors for a Two-Year Hitch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy says college-bound young people will
benefit from a new, two-year enlistment program designed to fill
some of the service's toughest jobs.
   About 600 men and women have signed on for the program, which
began last month.
   It is geared toward attracting ``the college-bound kid''
interested in earning benefits for higher education and seeing the
world before starting school, Vice Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the chief of
naval personnel, said in a recent interview.
   The lure is the Montgomery GI Bill, under which participants can
receive a $250 monthly stipend over three years of college.
   While sailors can leave the service after two years of active
duty under the program, they must stay serve an additional six
years with the non-drilling naval reserve.
   The program was created in response to congressional calls for
military spending cuts and leaner armed forces.
   ``We're looking for high school graduates,'' Boorda said.
``We're looking for quality people, but also people who may not
want to make the Navy a career.''
   Instead of attracting young men and women for a normal four- or
six-year enlistment with the promise of high-tech training, the new
program enlists sailors for ``general detail,'' the deck and
engineering assignments that are often dirty, labor-intensive and
hard to fill.
   ``These are tough jobs,'' Boorda said.
   He envisions bringing 2,000 such sailors into the service this
year, 14,000 over the next year. Now, 580,000 men and women serve
in the Navy.
   The program should help the service in coming years, when
Pentagon spending is expected to decline and the military's
active-duty roster of 2.1 million is expected to shrink.
   ``I have to figure a way to bring the Navy down in size without
hurting readiness or hurting those people who want to stay,''
Boorda said. ``We know we are going to get smaller.''
   Boorda said the move is only part of a ``bigger reduction
strategy'' that means the Navy will have to look at cutting
enlistments, enforcing retirements and, as a last resort,
involuntary separations.
   The two-year recruits will be finishing their duty ``exactly
when we need to get smaller,'' Boorda said. ``I'm not looking for
large numbers to stay.''
   The program also helps boost the numbers of trained sailors in
the reserves, a force that will need to grow in light of the
changes in the world environment and the lessened Soviet threat.
   Defense experts on Capitol Hill, such as Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., have called for cutting active
duty personnel back by 100,000 in the next fiscal year.
   Nunn also has backed proposals to put more emphasis on reserve
and national guard forces, which can be called up if national
security is threatened. That's a much cheaper option than paying
for large numbers of active-duty personnel.
   The two-year enlistment program comes at the right time,
according to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a specialist on military
personnel issues.
   ``It's a good approach when you need to fine tune'' the nation's
forces, said McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate
committee's manpower subcommittee.

<HEAD>Secret Police Chief Says Ceausescu's Son Opposed Parents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former secret police chief
testified Monday that Nicu Ceausescu, accused of ordering the
massacre of 89 civilians during the revolution that toppled his
father, often opposed his parents' policies.
   Gen. Col. Iulian Vlad, who headed deposed-dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's Securitate secret police, also said that during the
revolution there were no special security measures taken in Sibiu,
the town where Nicu was party boss.
   The 40-year-old youngest son of Ceausescu was arrested Dec. 22
while he was driving into Bucharest from Sibiu, 155 miles northwest
of the capital.
   Vlad testified that there were ``several occasions'' during
which Nicu was the only member of the state leadership to openly
oppose his parents' policies. ``His opposition to their political
policies intensified when he became first party secretary in
Sibiu,'' he added.
   According to the indictment, Nicu ordered troops to ``shoot
without warning'' at protesters during the revolution that toppled
his father. The indictment says 89 people were killed in Sibiu as
the result of those orders.
   Nicu was party boss in the southern Transylvanian town, from
1987 until his arrest. The trial is held at the Trade Union Culture
Center in Sibiu.
   Vlad said ``no special arms or ammunition'' were sent to Sibiu
during the revolution.
   ``Although the rest of the country was in a special state, no
such measures were taken in Sibiu,'' he said.
   He added, however, that after the Dec. 16 massacre in the
western city of Timisoara that sparked the revolution, Nicu agreed
to special security measures for himself for the first time.
   Vlad said Nicu had ``a distaste'' for Securitate personnel
``including many in its leadership.''
   Nicu, who had a reputation for reckless drinking and the abuse
of women, was widely considered the most-hated Ceausescu after his
parents Nicolae and Elena. Surprisingly, people in Sibiu seem
sympathetic to his plight.
   According to unofficial sources, the trial, which began in late
May, will continue until Wednesday. Fourteen witnesses, including a
former girlfriend of Nicu's, will be called to testify, said the
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Nicu, who is recovering from a stab wound and reportedly
suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, was dressed in a gray jacket
and gray corduroy slacks. He wore tinted glasses.
   Ana Muresean, Commerce Minister under Ceausescu, also testified
Monday and reversed her original testimony that Nicu arrived in
Bucharest to take over after his parents' overthrow. She said the
testimony had been ``forced'' out of her by the prosecution during
pre-trial interrogation.
   She also said there was ``great dissension'' between Nicu and
his parents.
   After Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted in December, the dictator and
his wife were shot by a firing squad on Christmas Day.

<HEAD>White House May Ask Outside Experts to Review NASA Program</HEAD>

   Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the
National Space Council, asked NASA today to establish an outside
task force to consider the long-term direction of America's space
program.
   Quayle discussed the request in an hour-long meeting with NASA
Administrator Richard H. Truly.
   Reports circulated over the weekend that the White House was
considering restructuring the agency in the wake of its recent
setbacks, the grounding of the space shuttle fleet and a flaw in
the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope that prevents it from being
focused perfectly.
   The vice president said in a three-paragraph statement that
``contrary to some published reports, there is no White House
investigation of NASA.''
   The statement said Quayle had asked Truly ``to put together an
outside task force that will consider the future long-term
direction of the space program.'' It said the NASA chief and the
task force will report to the vice president.
   There was nothing in the statement about shaking up the agency.
NASA sources said Quayle privately had expressed confidence in
Truly's leadership.
   ``Space continues to be a top priority for this
administration,'' the Quayle statement said. ``We all want the best
ideas on how we can move into the next century maintaining our
leadership in space.''
   Quayle, Truly and White House chief of staff John Sununu talked
with several NASA critics in a meeting aboard Air Force Two on the
flight home Wednesday from the economic summit in Houston.
   Participants included former astronaut Eugene Cernan, former
NASA Administrator Thomas Paine, Cal Tech scientist Bruce Murray
and Hans Mark, chancellor of the University of Texas system.
   The White House may enlist a team of space experts from outside
government to aid in reviewing NASA, said the official, who spoke
Sunday on condition of anonymity.
   The administration source said Quayle and Truly are leading the
internal effort to find ways to get the space program back on track.
   Space News, a weekly industry newspaper, said in today's edition
that the restructuring ``stems from concern that a lack of public
support for space and federal budget pressures make it difficult
for NASA to carry out its missions'' and that the White House is
concerned the problems are institutional, rather than technical.
   The decision has not yet been made to convene a blue-ribbon
panel of experts, the source said, but ``if something is done, it
will be done with a combination of outside and inside advice.''
   CBS News reported Saturday that the administration likely will
name a panel of outside experts this week.
   Until its recent problems, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration seemed to be recovering from criticisms following
the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts.
   The shuttle fleet was grounded after hydrogen leaks were
discovered on space shuttles Columbia and Atlantis, but engineers
have located the leaks and officials say they are easy to fix.
   Also, NASA revealed that the $1.5 billion Hubble _ launched
April 25 _ has a focusing flaw that has sharply reduced its
usefulness. The agency blamed the problem on a defect in one of the
telescope's two mirrors.
   In addition to Quayle and Truly, the National Space Council
includes Sununu, budget Director Richard Darman, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher and other officials.

   Spanish soprano Montserrat Caballe was
slightly injured early Monday when a row of VIP seats collapsed
while she was watching a ballet, throwing her and other audience
members to the ground.
   The temporary seats gave way just as Caballe, Spanish tenor Jose
Carreras and the rest of the audience at Merida's Roman
amphitheater began applauding a production of Mstislav
Rostropovich's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' conducted by the composer.
   Caballe and Carreras opened the Merida Festival on Saturday,
singing in the Jules Massenet opera ``Herodiade.''
   Caballe fell more than 5 feet to the ground but walked away. She
suffered minor injuries to her wrist and leg, a regional government
spokesman said.
   Carreras, who was sitting in the same section, said he managed
to avoid falling.

   Teen-age star Danny Ponce of CBS's ``The
Hogan Family'' sums up his relationship with his mother this way:
``Once the money started to come in, it (messed) everything up,''
according to TV guide.
   The magazine, for its July 21 edition, interviewed Ponce and
some others who achieved fame and fortune before they reached
voting age.
   Ponce, 17, recently bought his own four-bedroom house with a
swimming pool. ``I don't live with my mother anymore, but we still
talk,'' Ponce said. ``I see her once in a while.''
   His mother, Dianne Ponce, claims Danny was using much of his
$400,000-a-year salary on drugs that he obtained from a cast member.
   ``None of it is true,'' Danny said. ``No one on the set would
give me drugs.''
   Bonnie Gold, whose daughter Tracey is on ABC's ``Growing
Pains,'' suggested: ``Before any kid gets on a series, I think the
parents should be interviewed and analyzed because that is where
the problem lies.''
   David Faustino, 16, of Fox's ``Married...With Children,'' said
that now that he's on a series, girls and drugs have been offered
to him but he is aware of the dangers of living too high.
   ``Every time there is an article about a Hollywood kid who has
shot himself or done drugs or ended up in jail, my parents clip it
out and paste it somewhere in my bedroom,'' Faustino said.

   Chung Myung-whun, conductor of
France's National Paris Bastille Opera and Orchestra, returned home
to perform Monday. He said that while he stumbles in speaking
Korean and French, music is universal.
   Chung will conduct the Bastille Orchestra in five performances
in Seoul July 18-21. The orchestra also will perform in Japan,
Germany and Spain in 1990. The Korean-born Chung, who grew up in
the United States, took over as head of the orchestra last year.
   ``When I held my first press conference in Paris, I couldn't
speak French ... only a few words and phrases,'' Chung told
reporters.
   To the amusement of the mostly Korean reporters, he also
apologized for his Korean language skills, somewhat forgotten
during his youth.
   ``My level of Korean is considerably worse than English,'' he
said in Korean.
   ``But as long as I can express feelings to music, that's all I
care about,'' he said. ``Music is not owned by a particular
country. It's shared by all people in the world. It doesn't matter
if you're Korean or Japanese, or someone else.''

   ``Rock Around the Clock'' propelled Haley and the Comets to the

rock 'n' roll classic will put them in the record books.
   Up to 1,000 musicians are expected here Thursday in an attempt

song together for the longest time.
   Last year, 465 guitarists showed up at the Peach Festival and

   That record fell in April, when 532 guitarists picked out
``Shake, Rattle and Roll'' for 43 minutes in Santa Cruz, Calif.
   ``We felt like we wanted to do what we could to get the record

   President Bush today welcomed Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's willingness to accept a united Germany as a
member of NATO.
   ``This comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation,''
Bush said in a written statement.
   Bush added, ``We think this solution is in the best interests of
all the countries of Europe, including the Soviet Union.''
   The president's statement was issued after Gorbachev said that
Germany was free to choose its own allies.
   ``Unified Germany receives complete sovereignty,'' Gorbachev
said, standing alongside West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at a
news conference in southern Russia.
   ``It has the right to use this sovereignty to make its choice,
that is its internal choice, meaning its variant of social
development, and meaning what it would like to be a part of, what
blocs to support,'' Gorbachev said.
   Kohl said West Germany wants a new unified state ``to be a
member of NATO.'' He said he was sure the government of East
Germany concurred.
   In his statement, Bush said that Gorbachev's position ``can be
seen as a response, perhaps in part, to the outcome of the NATO
summit in London where the alliance displayed its readiness to
adapt to the new realities in Europe and reach out to former
adversaries in the East.''
   NATO agreed to reduce nuclear and conventional weapons and
proposed a non-aggression declaration between the alliance and the
states of the Warsaw Pact. It also declared that nuclear arms would
be used only as a last resort.
   West Germany and its NATO allies have steadfastly insisted that
a united Germany be a part of the Western alliance.
   In Washington, the State Department said Gorbachev's comments
were ``most interesting and welcome.'' But it withheld further
comment pending study of Gorbachev's remarks.
   NATO, in a statement from Brussels, also praised Gorbachev's
acceptance of a unified Germany as member of the Western alliance.
It said such membership ``will increase stability for all ...
including the Soviet Union.''

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Nov. 15: Shortly after the Berlin Wall is opened and in the
middle of East Germany's political turmoil, President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev says unification ``is not a matter of topical politics,''
and to even discuss it is to interfere in Germans' internal affairs.
   Feb. 10: West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visits Moscow.
Afterward, he says he has received assurances from Gorbachev that
the Soviet Union will respect the German people's wish to live as
one nation.
   Feb. 14: Meeting in Ottawa, the United States and its major
European allies reach agreement on a two-stage formula for
unification.
   March 6: Gorbachev says a united Germany's membership in NATO is
``absolutely out of the question.'' The Soviet Union seeks a
neutral Germany.
   April 6: After three days of talks between Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and U.S. officials in Washington, Secretary
of State James A. Baker III says the Soviet Union is dropping its
demand that Germany be neutral, but still opposes NATO membership.
   April 29: East Germany's prime minister, Lothar de Maziere,
meets with Gorbachev and says Gorbachev still opposes NATO
membership for a united Germany.
   June 6: Shevardnadze and Baker meet in Copenhagen to discuss a
nine-point U.S. plan to meet Soviet security concerns about a
united Germany. Shevardnadze says the Soviet Union cannot agree to
all parts of it.
   June 12: Gorbachev says the Soviet Union might accept an
undefined associate membership in NATO for a united Germany, if
NATO is transformed from its Cold War stance against the Soviet
Union. West Germany and its allies reject the idea.
   Monday: Gorbachev and Kohl announce that a united Germany may
choose whatever alliance to which it wants to belong, clearing the
way for NATO membership.

   Seven Cubans broke into the
Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana today and took four diplomats
hostage, the state CTK news agency reported.
   The Mexican government news agency Notimex, in a report from
Havana, said the seven demanded a plane to take them to the United
States.
   The incident came after five Cubans seeking asylum occupied the
apartment of the charge d'affaires Friday and held him hostage for
a few hours.
   Charge d'affaires Jan Doemoek was among the diplomats CTK said
were being held hostage.
   According to the report, the seven Cubans broke into the embassy
building this morning and took the diplomats hostage as they were
holding a meeting.
   It said the Cuban citizens were acting ``very violently,'' but
that it was not clear whether they were armed. The news agency said
no one was hurt.
   It said that the diplomats held hostage included, in addition to
Doemoek, a commercial counsellor, a press secretary and a foreign
ministry official who had come to Havana to help negotiate a
solution for the 12 Cubans who have sought refuge in the embassy
over the past week.
   Czechoslovak state television quoted foreign ministry spokesman
Lubos Dobrovsky as saying that a deputy foreign minister would
leave for Havana immediately because ``it is necessary to protect
the safety of Czechoslovak citizens.''
   The brief CTK report did not give the demands of the seven
Cubans.
   The Mexican news agency quoted unidentified journalistic sources
in saying the seven Cubans demanded a plane to the United States.
It said the hostage-taking followed an argument between two groups
of Cubans seeking to leave their Communist homeland.
   Twelve Cubans remain at the embassy, Czechoslovak Foreign
Ministry officials said. Two students, identified as Igor Campana
Dada and Alejandro Rosendo Lugo, decided to leave Friday. The first
Cubans gained access to the compound July 9.
   Dependents of some Czechoslovak diplomats have left Havana.
   About 30 Czechoslovaks left Sunday on a regular airliner, the
daily Lidova Demokracie reported. Among them were 12 or 13 wives
and children of Czechoslovak diplomats, Foreign Ministry official
Jindrich Opava said.
   Ten more were dependants of diplomats whose tours had ended,
Opava said. The rest were tourists.
   ``It was not an evacuation, they left at their own request,''
Opava said of the departure of the diplomats' relatives.
   Five Cubans, meanwhile, were still holed up today at the
abandoned apartment of the Czechoslovak charge d'affaires, Jan
Doemoek, officials said. Doemoek fled his home July 12, after the
five forced their way in. Doemoek's apartment is not in the embassy
compound.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, in his first official statement on
the affair, called the Cubans ``antisocial elements encouraged by
Czechoslovak diplomats,'' Lidova Demokracie said.
   He also was quoted as saying that Cuba has no agreement on
diplomatic asylum with European countries, and the embassies of
these countries have no right to grant the asylum.
   ``Czechoslovak diplomats in Havana try to interpret the
situation in a way that indicates that Cuban government should
solve the situation ... the affair should be solved by the
Czechoslovak side,'' the daily quoted Castro as saying.
   The influx of asylum-seekers has heightened tensions between
Cuba and Czechoslovakia, close allies before last fall's democratic
upheaval toppled Prague's hard-line Communist leaders.
   Castro has resisted the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union, sticking to his orthodox Marxist policies.
   Three Cuban asylum-seekers have also taken refuge in the Spanish
Embassy in Havana. And on Sunday, the Foreign Ministry in Madrid
said Cuban police violated the embassy by chasing a fourth
asylum-seeker into the compound and hauling him away.

   One of Seattle's leading advocates for the
homeless remained in critical but stable condition today after
being shot by a man he was trying to evict from his homeless
shelter, police said.
   Robert Willmott, 50, a civic gadfly who ran unsuccessfully for
mayor last year, was shot in the neck and chest in the
confrontation late Saturday, authorities said.
   Police said they questioned and released a man who told them he
fired in self-defense after Willmott pointed a rifle at him. Police
later said Willmott's weapon was not loaded.
   In surgery at Harborview Medical Center, a .22-caliber bullet
was removed from Willmott's back but a second remained lodged in
his neck, hospital officials said. Though still in critical
condition this morning, Willmott had partially regained
consciousness, said hospital spokeswoman Janet Skeels.
   Officers sent to the scene of the shooting at Willmott's
shelter, Strand Helpers, took a 36-year-old man into custody, said
police spokeswoman Tina Drain.
   She said the man told officers Willmott had threatened him with
a pistol for reasons unknown, then later burst into his family's
room with a rifle.
   The man grabbed his own weapon and fired, Drain said. Detective
Jay Mooney later confirmed that Willmott's weapon was unloaded.
   There were no witnesses except the tenant's family, and evidence
at the scene corroborated what he said, so police released the man
pending further investigation, Drain said.
   Larry Branigan, who operates the Strand Helpers office during
the day, said the man questioned by police had been causing trouble
almost from the time he arrived with his wife and children on June
8. The man often made suggestive remarks to women residents and
threatened men, he said.
   ``Will (Willmott) finally said enough was enough and told the
guy he'd have to leave,'' Branigan said.
   A Strand Helpers brochure says the group has relied on donations
and volunteer work without drawing from federal, state or local
agencies to serve more than 1.3 million meals and provide 280,000
free nights of housing since it was founded in 1962.

   Children forage among mangroves for
weeds to fill the dinner pot, and two women scoop water into
buckets, their eyes averted from the headless corpse polluting the
swamp.
   The beachside scene near the clifftop British, French and U.S.
Embassies has become commonplace in Monrovia, a capital at the
mercy of lawless troops and rebels bent on vengeance.
   After nearly a month under rebel siege, food, water and fuel are
running out, epidemics threaten, and bodies litter the capital,
turning up on beaches, in creeks and on streets. One hundred
corpses are rotting in the morgue of the John F. Kennedy Memorial
Hospital.
   Every night after curfew, people go to bed to the sound of
gunfire from soldiers frightening witnesses away from their
looting. They often wake up to the sound of cannons and rockets.
   Monrovians wait for the rebels to break through, expecting
either a blood bath or redemption, depending on their tribe.
   About a quarter of this West African nation's 2 million people
lived in Monrovia before the fighting led to an exodus.
   At the only working hospital, an emergency field station has
been set up by Belgium's Doctors without Borders, a boy of about 10
is treated for a bullet wound to the hand, flinching but never
crying.
   He explains that his father sent him with $5 to the grocery
store that had opened for the first time in more than week.
   A soldier stopped him, and demanded the money clutched in his
fist. When he refused, the soldier shot his hand, snatched the
money and sauntered off to a beer stall, he said.
   Doctors at the hospital, staffed by Liberians, Belgians and nuns
from hospitals no longer operating, said his hand would be saved.
   Others are less lucky.
   ``I have been in war situations before and never has it been as
it is in Monrovia, never before,'' said Reginald Moreels, a war
surgeon and president of the Belgian chapter of Doctors without
Borders.
   ``The people who are shooting are totally undisciplined, totally
uncontrolled,'' he said.
   Western defense attaches said the gunshot wounds are
particularly bad because the soldiers and rebels often fire their
rifles at point-blank range.
   But no one at the Roman Catholic St. Joseph's Hospital, in
Sinkor suburb, asks patients whether they are soldiers, rebels or
civilians. The only rule, on a sign outside, is: ``ABSOLUTELY NO
WEAPONS ALLOWED.''
   All uniforms are burned at the hospital, to protect patients on
both sides from being victimized. A Liberian relief worker got a
shock when a bullet exploded in the pocket of a uniform he was
burning.
   The American Embassy sends water tankers escorted by Marines to
collect water from a creek near Presdient Samuel Doe's fortified
mansion. Few others go near the creek for fear of soldiers.
   Others go to the polluted swamp near the U.S. and British
Embassies, where the headless body rots. Another solution is to
collect rainwater.
   A coconut grove near the bridge at the end of Randall Street is
a dumping ground for bodies flung into trenches dug by bulldozers.
   Dr. Robert Kpoto, Liberia's chief medical officer, is concerned
about water-borne diseases like cholera and typhoid.
   Risking rebel gunfire, a motley fleet of aircraft ranging from a
Soviet-made Antonov transport to Cessna executive planes has
ferried thousands of people out of Monrovia from an airstrip three
miles from the city center.
   The price of an air ticket to Freetown, capital of neighboring
Sierra Leone, has quintupled to $500 in six weeks.
   At least one plane already has several bullet holes.
   Peace talks are under way in Freetown, but they have been
inconclusive. Meanwhile, the rebels continue their siege of
Monrovia.
   The rebel National Patriotic Front has accused Doe of
corruption, nepotism and human rights abuses. They want him to
resign and stand trial.
   There is also a strong tribal aspect to the war. The rebels are
apparently mostly members of the Gio and Mano tribes.
   Doe, a Krahn, has strong backing from his own tribe and the
Mandingo.
   Human rights groups have accused both sides of slaughtering
hundreds of civilians.
   Liberia was founded by the descendants of freed American slaves
in 1847. They dominated the native peoples until Doe, an army
master sergeant, seized power in April 1980. He had most of the
ousted Cabinet ministers shot on the beach.

   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem fighters on
Monday attacked a stronghold of their Syrian-backed rivals in the
rugged hills of southern Lebanon, touching off clashes in which at
least 12 people were killed.
   Police also said 50 people were wounded in the daylong battles.
   Police said militiamen of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party
of God, launched an attack on the village of Jarjou, held by the
more secular Amal militia, behind a tank, artillery and rocket
barrage.
   Amal and Hezbollah have been fighting intermittently for three
years for dominance of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's
largest sect.
   Monday's casualties raised the overall casualty toll to 1,061
killed and 3,201 wounded since mid-1986.
   Police said six Amal militiamen, four Hezbollah fighters and two
civilians were killed. The wounded included 38 combatants, 31 of
them from Amal, and the rest were civilians, police reported.
   Amal's leadership said in a statement that its fighters
``crushed the attackers who belonged to the Party of Satan'' in a
five-hour battle. It said 25 of their men were wounded.
   Police said the fighting continued despite Amal's claim it had
beaten off the Hezbollah assault. Heavy artillery exchanges raged
through the afternoon.
   At times, 15 shells a minute were exploding in the battle zone,
police said.
   Hezbollah earlier accused Amal of shelling its positions in the
villages of Jabal Safi, Mlita and Luweizeh with artillery and
rockets.
   It said in a statement that four Hezbollahis were killed and
seven wounded.
   Columns of black smoke billowed from the hilly region as
ambulances darted in and out of the battle zone carrying casualties
to hospitals in south Lebanon.
   Also in southern Lebanon, fighters of the Sunni Moslem Nasserite
Popular Organization fought a two-hour gunbattle with militiamen of
the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army around Kfar Falous, east of
the provincial capital of Sidon.
   Both sides used rockets and artillery. Police said two people
were wounded before the clashes died down around 1 p.m.

   A major earthquake rocked Manila and
surrounding Luzon island today and officials reported at least 53
people killed and scores of buildings destroyed.
   Scores of people were believed trapped under the rubble of
crumbled buildings, including 150 reportedly trapped in the Hyatt
Hotel in the mountain resort of Baguio.
   Rescue efforts were hampered by poor communications and lack of
equipment. Different government agencies maintained their own
casualty counts, and some put the death toll at nearly 70. Hundreds
were injured.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. registered the quake
at 7.7 on the Richter scale. The June 21 earthquake in Iran
registered between 7.3 and 7.7 and killed at least 40,000 people.
   There were scores of aftershocks.
   The Office of Civil Defense said the Philippine Christian
College collapsed in the provincial capital of Cabanatuan City. The
city of more than 80,000 is 60 miles north of Manila and was near
the epicenter.
   The office said at least 34 people were killed in the city and
outlying area, but earlier reports from the office had said 41 were
killed in Cabanatuan. Officials in Cabanatuan said hundreds of
students were unaccounted for, but it was uncertain how many were
in the building when it collapsed.
   In Baguio, 110 miles to the north, portions of several luxury
hotels collapsed. The Manila radio station DZRH said 150 people
were trapped in the Hyatt Hotel. A woman who identified herself as
a public relations officer of the hotel said most of those trapped
were in the casino.
   She did not give her name. Officials in Baguio appealed for
heavy equipment and for blood which they said was in short supply.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager said medical supplies
had been sent to Baguio by helicopter.
   Air Force Master Sgt. Dan Fuller, reached by telephone at the
U.S.-run Camp John Hay in Baguio, said the city was without
electricity and that damage was widespread.
   ``We're without power,'' he said. ``We've had structural damage
here on base. We do have seven buildings down downtown which as far
as we know they are compeletely fallen in.''
   He said U.S. personnel assisted in rescue efforts.
   The Red Cross reported five dead in Baguio but feared the toll
could go much higher. The Red Cross reported four dead in the
northern province of Pangasinan.
   One person died of injuries in Manila, where the temblor cracked
buildings, knocked out electricity and communications and sent
thousands fleeing into the streets.
   A radio station in Dagupan, 100 miles north of Manila, said 13
people were killed there, but the report could not be confirmed. It
said all died in stampedes as panic-stricken people tried to flee a
movie theater and schools.
   The quake struck at about 4:30 p.m. In Manila, numerous
buildings were damaged and one fire broke out in the city's Santa
Cruz district.
   The Institute of Seismology and Vulcanology, said the tremblor
was centered just south of Cabanatuan, capital of Nueva Ecija
province.
   The temblor knocked several radio stations temporarily off the
air. Stop lights in Manila were knocked out of service, creating
huge traffic jams.
   Officials reported widespread damage throughout Luzon, where
many towns and cities were without power. Radio station DZRH quoted
an affiliate station as saying a church in the northern province of
Ilocos Sur collapsed.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered the military to launch an
islandwide rescue operation. Her spokesman, Adolf Azcuna, said the
president was meeting senators in her office when the quake struck
and took cover under a table.
   Reynaldo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of
Seismology and Vulcanology, said the quake measured 7 on the
Richter scale in Manila. Officials said it was the capital's
strongest quake since 1968.
   A quake measured at 7.8 struck the Philippines in 1976, killing
8,000 people. Most of them died in a tidal wave which struck the
southern island of Mindanao.
   Manila radio stations reported cracks in the walls of many
buildings, including the downtown ticket office of Philippine
Airlines and The Manila Hotel, a luxury hotel on Manila Bay from
which hundreds of guests were evacuated into the streets.
   In the capital, office workers rushed into the streets in panic.
Several were seen praying or making signs of the cross.
   The Richter scale measures the magnitude of a quake according to
ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one
digit represents a tenfold increase of magnitude. A quake of
magnitude 7 is capable of widespread, heavy damage.
   The quake that struck Iran on June 21, which was measured at
between 7.3 and 7.7 on the Richter scale, killed 40,000 people,
injured another 60,000 and left half a million homeless.

<HEAD>East German Church To Get Help With Missing Treasures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An East German church is getting help
from West Germany to retrieve art treasures believed pilfered by an
American soldier at the close of World War II, a West German
official said Monday.
   East and West Germany also agreed to build an information
database aimed at the return of other art works that vanished when
the Third Reich fell.
   Litigation to retrieve the so-called Quedlinburg treasures from
bank vaults in Texas is already under way. The Foreign Ministry
said Monday that West Germany would pay the legal costs.
   Bonn's help in meeting the expense will be a major boost for the
Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg, which claims its treasures were
stolen at the end of World War II, said Klaus Maurice, director of
the West German Cultural Foundation of the States.
   ``Nobody knew until now who had to pay, but they will pay and
this is marvelous,'' Maurice said.
   The Quedlinburg treasures include two rare medieval manuscripts,
a jeweled, ivory-carved container for relics and several
rock-crystal and ivory objects. They were allegedly removed from a
mine shaft where they had been hidden in the final days of the war.
   Maurice said there was no doubt the art works in question were
authentic.
   The Quedlinburg treasures, among Germany's most famous art
works, were allegedly taken by a U.S. army officer stationed in
Quedlinburg, now East Germany, in 1945, and brought to his hometown
of Whitewright, Texas.
   The church is suing the sister and brother of the officer, the
late Joe T. Meador, to recover the treasures.
   Maurice said officials have no clear idea of how many other
works were allegedly looted from Germany's artitistic heritage in
the final months of the war.
   ``The problem up to now is that we had two states and it wasn't
easy to speak with East Germany,'' Maurice said. ``Now, this is
easier.''
   Maurice spoke after attending a two-hour meeting to dicuss
coordinated approaches toward retrieving lost German art. Also
attending the meeting was a Ministry of Culture representative from
East Germany, which is expected to formally unite with its Western
neighbor in December.
   The new database is to be established in Berlin and collect
information from museums, churches and other institutions
throughout the two Germanys, Maurice said. The database will
compare pre-World War II inventories with current records in an
attempt to get a complete picture of what is missing, he said.

<HEAD>Radical Iranian Newspaper Accuses Western Reporters of Spying</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Iranian newspaper Monday said
many western reporters sent to cover events in Iran were spies and
warned the government to beware.
   The Persian-language Jomhuri Islami, which reflects the views of
government hard-liners, said many western journalists visited Iran
``to fulfill their missions assigned by the Zionists and western
spying agencies.''
   The article, which was obtained by The Associated Press in
Cyprus, blamed officials of the Ministry of Islamic Guidance, which
is in charge of regulating the activities of foreign reporters, for
giving reporters too much freedom on their trips to Iran.
   Journalists who visit Iran are assigned agents from the ministry
who accompany them on all trips outside their hotels. Reporters are
also required to submit their film and tapes to ministry officials
for approval.
   ``It is simplicity if we think that the CIA, the (Israeli)
Mossad and other intelligence services simply use one device to
obtain information from Iran.
   ``In addition to their set formula, they send reporters,
photographers and and cameramen as a cover-up,'' the newspaper
alleged.
   The Iranian government allows few western news organizations to
base representatives in Iran and reporters are only to visit the
country only on special occassions. Recently, reporters were
allowed in to cover the first anniversary of the death of Iran's
spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the June
earthquake that left about 40,000 dead.
   On such visits, the paper alleged, many reporters ``take full
advantage to carry out their mission and take interesting gifts to
their masters and receive handsome rewards.''
   To support its claim, the newspaper said an American television
crew that visited Iran in June to cover the anniversary of
Khomeini's death had four members, none of whom had majored in
journalism.
   ``When the United States has tens of colleges and schools for
the training of mass media men, they don't need other people to be
used in the media field,'' the article said.
   In a section of the article subtitled ``sample of mischiefs,''
the paper said the American crew took a picture of an unfinished
building which was the subject of a dispute between the United
States and Iran at the international court in the Hague.
   The article said the television team had ``full knowledge about
the geographical situation of Tehran and its streets,'' and that it
attempted to visit a public park and the main shopping center in
central Tehran.
   The paper took umbrage at an alleged remark by the American
reporter, claiming that the shopping district was full of Michael
Jackson fans and that he intended to interview them.
   The article accused a reporter from another major American
television network of compiling a full list of leaders of
fundamentalist Moslem, pro-Iranian Lebanese and Palestinian groups
invited to Tehran to participate in the first anniversary
ceremonies.
   The full list of the guests was, however, also reported by the
state-run radio and television and all major newspapers.
   The paper gave the following as other examples of
``non-journalistic activities'':
   _A reporter from a major British televsion network tried to take
an unauthorized photograph of a refinery.
   _Another British radio journalist visited downtown Tehran and
tried to compile a report of illegal, black market sales of hard
currency.
   _A Danish reporter tried to compile ``a negative report of the
economy,'' and accused him of attempting to photograph a woman at
the weekly Friday prayers, dressed in ``western clothes.''
   The newspaper also accused Western reporters of ``mischiefs'' in
reporting on the quake which killed some 40,000.
   It said they used their visits to collect information on the
condition of women, the economy, politics and the military. The
newspaper also accused reporters of counting the number of Iranian
helicopters involved in relief operations.
   Jomhuri Islami said the guidance ministry should offer
facilities only ``to genuine journalists and not spies.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Question CIA Analyses of Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. presidents have for four decades relied
on CIA assessments of the Soviet economy that vastly overstate the
economic strength of America's chief rival, witnesses told a Senate
committee Monday.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said the faulty numbers
could well have created an unjustified level of concern about
Soviet strength that in turn led the United States to overspend on
defense.
   The CIA has come to be relied upon as the principal Western
source of information about the Soviet economy, including its
overall gross national product and the proportion of the GNP
devoted to military might.
   The spy agency has rated Soviet economic growth as higher than
that of the United States for most of the period since it began its
assessments in the early 1950s. Last year, the CIA put the Soviet
GNP at 51 percent of the U.S. GNP of $5.23 trillion.
   That figure puts the CIA near the top of a range of estimates,
which go as low as 14 percent, and Moynihan said a more realistic
number would be around 33 percent. ``If we had kept with that
one-third number, we would have behaved differently,'' Moynihan
said.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the one-third figure is probably a good estimate.
   The spy agency's chief analyst of the Soviet Union, George Kolt,
conceded the agency's number is probably too high but maintained
``we have done a good job on a very complex issue.''
   Kolt said the CIA would adjust its figures downward, perhaps
nearer to an economic growth of 35 percent, if it can get better
information on the quality of Soviet goods and can improve its own
analytical methods.
   But he said the agency's estimates have been accurate when it
comes to Soviet defense spending.
   Boskin pointed out that any estimates of the Soviet economy are
made difficult because of problems in getting accurate data about
production and consumption, the inability to compare currencies and
the fundamental problem of assigning value to items in a system
without market pricing.
   The process is fraught with distortions, such as the Soviet
plant that produces an excess of easy-to-make ball bearings, then
ships them to a steel mill where they are melted down and sent back
to make more bearings, Boskin said.
   Moynihan pointed out that it is difficult, as well, for
Americans to conceive of a system where fully one-half of
agricultural production can be lost to spoilage because of a
defective distribution system.
   Those difficulties will confront the International Monetary Fund
when it seeks to carry out a study of the Soviet economy mandated
last week by the world's seven most developed nations. The IMF
study is to be the basis for any future aid to the Soviet Union.
   Congress ran into its own problems in trying to assess the CIA's
performance. A witness from the General Accounting Office, Allan
Mendelowitz, said he had been stymied by the agency in seeking
information for a congressionally mandated study of CIA methodology.
   ``This is discouraging,'' Moynihan said, promising to take the
matter up with CIA Director William Webster. ``Didn't I read
somewhere ... that the Cold War is over?''

   It took a lot to rile residents of this
farming community best known as the birthplace of Thomas E. Dewey _
until firefighters were barred from sitting in front of their
firehouse.
   About 250 people have signed a petition to protest the order by
the fire chief and city manager. And more 50 people turned out for
a City Council meeting July 9 to press for the ban to be dropped.
   ``I figure, they've done it for years, why not keep doing it?''
said Don Hornus, a regular patron at the Roundtable restaurant. ``I
don't know why they're making such a big deal over it. We don't get
that much controversy over things that matter.''
   The motto of this tree-lined city about 100 miles northwest of
Detroit proclaims that it's ``a shade better'' than other
communities. The city of 16,455 is the birthplace of Dewey, the
Republican presidential candidate in 1944 and 1948, and was a
leading manufacturer of caskets in the 1920s.
   City policy permitted the 18 firefighters who work 24-hour
shifts to sit in front of the station after 5 p.m. But two months
ago, Chief John Kenney banned it around the clock after seeing some
firefighters in front of the station at midday. He said it looked
unprofessional.
   Firefighters can still sit outside on the other sides of the
one-story fire station or in its air-conditioned lounge when
they're waiting for emergency calls.
   Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Mike McCloskey said
opinion is virtually unanimous that the city went too far with the
ban. ``I think it's probably a way of life for firemen to sit in
front of the fire station,'' he said.
   Heat from the public prompted City Council last week to order
City Manager Gregg Guetschow to solve the dispute. Guetschow said
the firefighters' union has asked for a meeting to discuss the
sitting situation.
   Union President James Treadway did not return a message left on
his answering machine Monday. In a letter to The Argus-Press
newspaper, he wrote, ``Sitting in front of the fire station in the
evening is a tradition that predates all of the current
firefighters.''
   In a letter published Monday, Dick Marr, 24-year firefighter,
wrote:
   ``If you wonder just what the firemen get out of sitting in
front of the station, it is just watching the people go by, tooting
their horns, waving and watching the smiles on the kids and their
parents when we wave back. It's the thank-yous from the people who
stop by.''
   The city manager or fire chief would neither discuss the ban nor
allow on-duty firefighters to be interviewed.
   ``This really in the whole scheme of things is a very, very
minor issue that should have been dealt with under the contract and
will be dealt with under the contract just like every other
grievance we get is,'' Guetschow said.
   He said the city is being unfairly ridiculed because it let a
small matter get out of hand. But The Argus-Press said City Council
deserved the criticism.
   ``There are few jobs that require their workers to go to work
every day knowing it could be their last,'' an editorial said.
   ``We don't care what they talk about, to whom they talk, or if
they want to play a few hands of gin rummy. Or snooze. Or eat. Or
turn cartwheels or floss their teeth. Or just sit.''

   The woman known as the Central Park jogger
climbed unsteadily onto the witness stand Monday and described the
lasting effects of a beating she barely survived and does not
remember.
   Speaking in a firm voice, the woman testified she has trouble
walking and seeing, cannot smell _ and cannot remember why.
   She said she remembers breaking a dinner date with a friend on
April 19, 1989, because of work, but does not remember entering the
park to run around 9:30 p.m., when she was gang-raped and viciously
beaten by marauding youths who left her naked and near death in a
puddle of mud and blood.
   ``What was your very next memory?'' asked Assistant District
Attorney Elizabeth Lederer.
   ``I remember waking up in the hospital on a Friday evening, late
in May,'' she said. ``A very good friend of mine was in the room
and so was a nurse. It was the Memorial Day weekend.''
   She said she was in the hospital about six weeks before being
transferred to a rehabilitation center.
   Before her testimony, tension filled the courtroom during the 2{
minutes from when she was called until she took the stand. It was
not clear what took so long, but finally she walked shakily into
the room, taking short steps as a court officer held her elbow and
helped her climb the witness stand.
   During her 10 minutes on the stand, the woman did not appear to
look at the three youths charged with maiming her; the three looked
at their hands, fiddled with pens or stared into space.
   There were no obvious reactions by the jurors.
   Defense attorneys asked the witness no questions.
   ``Do you suffer any lasting injuries as a result of what
happened to you on April 19, 1989?'' asked Lederer.
   ``I have problems with balance when I'm walking, and
coordination. At times, I'll veer off to the right or the left,''
she said. ``I have trouble walking down steps. I also lost my sense
of smell completely. That has not come back.''
   ``I have double vision. When I'm reading, I hold papers over to
the left to compensate. It takes a fair amount of concentration to
make the image one.''
   ``It's worse when my eyes are tired,'' and worsens still if
she's in a dark room, she said.
   In an attempt to blunt assertions by defense attorneys that a
rape may not have occurred, the jogger was questioned about her
sexual activity and use of a diaphragm for birth control.
   The woman, who was attacked on a Wednesday, testified that she
had last had sex the previous Sunday, with her boyfriend.
Afterward, she went running with her boyfriend and with a diaphragm
still inserted.
   A DNA expert, Dwight Adams, who works for the FBI, testified
earlier that semen that matched her boyfriend's DNA profile was
found on the jogger's black running tights.
   The prosecution apparently was trying to show the semen was
deposited there on Sunday, and that she wore the same pants on
Wednesday.
   Adams also said none of the other semen samples matched the
defendants' or the boyfriend's.
   The victim, the prosecution's 34th witness, was called as the
trial entered its fourth week.
   Antron McCray and Raymond Santana and Yusef Salaam, all 16, are
charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, assault, robbery
and riot in the attack on the woman and two male joggers.
   They are being tried in an adult court, but if convicted they
will be sentenced as juvenile offenders to up to 10 years in prison.
   Three other youths face trial later this year.
   The woman, a 30-year-old investment banker, has recovered enough
to return to work at Salomon Brothers Inc., where she is a vice
president in corporate finance.
   The witness was dressed in a purple, double-breasted business
suit. Her blond hair was cut short and away from her face,
permitting a view of the jagged scar which runs from above her left
eyebrow down across her cheek.
   Justice Thomas B. Galligan told the courtroom artists not to
draw the woman because she had expressed anxiety about having her
likeness shown and was entitled, because of the nature of the
crime, to make that request. Her name has been withheld by news
organizations.
   The woman was asked to identify the clothing she was wearing the
night of the attack. Lederer showed her a T-shirt, now almost
completely brown with dried blood.
   ``Do you recognize this?'' Lederer asked.
   ``That's the shirt that I used to wear,'' she replied.
   ``Prior to April 19, 1989, what color was it?'' Lederer asked.
   ``It was white,'' she answered.
   The prosecution said the woman was attacked as she jogged after
work. The T-shirt, twirled tightly to form a kind of rope, was used
to bind her hand to her neck and gag her while she was raped and
bludgeoned, detectives have testified.
   Robert Burns, Salaam's lawyer, said outside the courtroom he did
not cross-examine the witness because, ``She came here as a
helpless victim. She served no evidentiary purpose.''
   Santana's lawyer, Peter Rivera, said, ``In the long run, I think
her testimony helps us, the fact that she came in and couldn't
identify any of the defendants, and could not even (remember) going
to the park.''
   As Rivera spoke, supporters of the defendants shouted,
``Sellout! Sellout! Who're you representing, the boys or the
victim?''

   A car crashed through the window of a
crowded convenience store Monday, killing a patron and injuring
seven other people, police said.
   Police said they don't know what caused the accident. Witnesses
told police that the car may have been trying to avoid other
vehicles.
   Construction worker Joseph Dougherty said he was sitting at a
table with three others at the WaWa market when he saw a car coming

   ``We all jumped up. Three of the guys went down and I just kept
on heading for the front door,'' he said.
   Dougherty said he had noticed a man sitting at a counter by the

   ``The car just crushed him right to the wall,'' he said.
   Police Capt. Edward DiMato confirmed the man was killed. The
victim's identity was not immediately released.
   The car's occupants included a man, a woman and two children,
police said. It could not be immediately determined if they were
among the seven injured.
   Two were admitted to hospitals and five were released after
treatment, authorities said.
   The market at 38th and Spruce streets on the University of
Pennsylvania campus has seating for patrons in a restaurant section.

<HEAD>Solidarity Veterans Form Political Party Opposed to Walesa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent Solidarity activists who
oppose chairman Lech Walesa formed a new political movement Monday
that sympathizes with the government and advocates a popular vote
for president.
   The movement, called Democratic Action, said it would try to
present a ``strong alternative,'' to the 2-month-old Center
Alliance which backs Solidarity leader Walesa and wants him named
president by parliament this year.
   The political movement's formation comes a few days after Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Walesa declared a political truce
in their fued over the pace of political and economic changes.
   More than 90 people attended the founding meeting held at
Parliament. Those attending include many of the 63 senior advisers
and longtime Solidarity activists who broke ranks with Walesa at a
stormy June 24 meeting of the national Citizens Committee, which
Walesa controls.
   The groups leaders include Zbigniew Bujak, former Warsaw
regional leader of Solidarity and the head of the Solidarity
underground during the martial-law period, and Wladyslaw Frasyniuk,
the longtime leader of Solidarity in Lower Silesia.
   The new movement scheduled a founding congress for July 28 and
representatives said they intended to meet with Solidarity members
of both houses of parliament this Friday to invite them to join the
movement.
   Bujak and Fransyniuk were once regarded as Walesa's potential
heirs within Solidarity. But in recent months they have distanced
themselves from him, complaining about his autocratic style.
   Bujak said the movement has its ``own proposals concerning the
system of the state and style of politics.''
   The group's first demand is for popular presidential elections
this year.
   Both Center Alliance and Democratic Action presume President
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the former Communist Party leader, will be
persuaded to resign well ahead of his scheduled 1995 departure.
   ``A fast presidential election will thus contribute to improving
the political situation, ... allowing the Sejm (Parliament) to
complete its work.''
   He said his party also sees it as essential that the next
president is elected by the people, and not by parliament.
   Walesa's opponents have said polls indicate he may have a
difficult time winning a popular vote for president. Walesa's
supporters want parliament to appoint a president. They say popular
presidential elections should be held after a new constitution is
written.
   Bujak and Frasyniuk said some members of the Solidarity-led
government support their movement but they did not know if
Mazowiecki would join.

<TEXT>
   The White House, in its annual reality check,
has confessed the government's deficit problem is far worse than it
admitted last January.
   Now instead of being the Pollyanna of budget forecasters, the
administration sounds more like Chicken Little, shouting ``the sky
is falling.''
   In submitting his proposed budget to Congress six months ago,
President Bush foresaw a budget deficit, absent changes in law, of
$100.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Bush said that figure, which was $36.5 billion above the
required deficit limit for 1991, could be handled with a collection
of spending cuts and a hodgepodge of small tax hikes that would
meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $64 billion for 1991.
   Now comes the administration's ``Mid-session Review of the
Budget,'' and the president sees a much more formidable challenge.
   Instead of a $100 billion deficit, the deficit has ballooned to
$168.8 billion _ $231.4 billion if the savings and loan bailout is
taken into account.
   What happened?
   In the real world, not a whole lot.
   The economy that was chugging along at a sub-par growth rate in
January has changed little in the intervening months. Interest
rates have been stuck at their December levels for most of the
year. The cost of the savings and loan bailout has been what most
people feared _ horrendous.
   The Congressional Budget Office and many private forecasters all
had budget estimates in January that were far higher than the
administration's
   However, since the president is required in his January budget
to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit targets only on paper, not in
reality, the administration forecast a far different world six
months ago.
   It saw economic growth rebounding smartly, thus bringing in more
tax revenue. Normally, interest rates rise along with economic
growth. But in the administration's world, interest rates would
drop sharply as growth rebounded. This helps the bottom line as
well because it reduces the government's borrowing costs on the $3
trillion national debt.
   And as for the S&amp;Ls, the administration, despite widespread
warnings to the contrary, low-balled the estimate of how much the
government would need to clean up the mess.
   While the whole process may not win a ``truth-in-budgeting''
award, it did allow the president to submit a 1991 budget that
honored his ``read-my-lips'' pledge against tax increases.
   But with the new budget year set to start Oct. 1, the
administration by law must take another look at the economic and
budget landscape, based on actual performance over the last six
months.
   Bush's new budget estimates had to take into account the reality
that economic growth has not picked up, that interest rates have
not fallen and that spending on the S&amp;L problem has been horrendous.
   It may well have been the fast-approaching deadline for the new
budget estimate that forced the president's hand last month and
caused his reversal on the tax question.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget Director Richard
Darman and Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of
Economic Advisers, all dodged the question Monday of just how much
in new taxes the administration would be willing to accept to close
the yawning budget gap, saying that issue would have to be
addressed as part of the budget negotiations with Congress.
   But, in addition to offering the stark numbers, the
administration seemed to be proposing the outline of a possible
agreement Monday.
   The budget document estimated the deficit both with S&amp;L spending
counted against Gramm-Rudman target and not counted. While Darman
insisted that the administration was not taking a stand on this
issue, the administration seemed to be signalling a willingness to
support an accounting change that will not count S&amp;L spending
against the Gramm-Rudman targets.
   That would still leave $100 billion in deficit reductions needed
to meet the 1991 Gramm-Rudman limit of $64 billion.
   Boskin said a deficit fix of that magnitude could well tip the
country into a recession. But the administration also warned that
anything less than $50 billion to $55 billion in deficit cuts would
not be viewed ``as a credible attack on the budget problem.''
   Thus the administration appeared to signal a willingness to
accept a spending and tax package totalling $50 billion to $55
billion while removing S&amp;L costs from the Gramm-Rudman accounting
and raising the Gramm-Rudman target for 1991 and following years.
That law, whose targets were stretched out once before in 1987, now
calls for a balanced budget by 1993.
   Despite the fact that the budget negotiations have been going
nowhere for weeks, Darman expressed hope Monday that a deal could
be reached before Congress leaves for its August recess.
   He said the negotiators had come perhaps 60 percent to 70
percent of the way toward striking a deal.
   ``The unfortunate thing is that the last 30 or 40 percent of the
way is all of the hard stuff. That's where the really tough choices
have to be made,'' Darman said.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to their lowest level in six
months.
   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.62 percent, down from 7.81 percent
last week. Another $9 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.52 percent, down from 7.75 percent last

   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.57
percent and six-month bills averaged 7.44 percent Jan. 8.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors

$9,619.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the

for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 8.09
percent last week, up from 8.06 percent the previous week.

   The head of Soviet television and radio said
Monday he fears ``an orgy of democracy'' now that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has acted to loosen controls on the state broadcasting
monopoly.
   Mikhail F. Nenashev, the chief of Gostelradio and a Communist
Party traditionalist, said in an interview broadcast on Soviet TV
that the decree issued by Gorbachev Sunday will make ``managing
television ... much more complex than in the past.''
   Gorbachev's ``Presidential Decree on Democratization of
Television and Radio,'' is designed to cut back on the Communist
Party's monopoly on the airwaves.
   The decree ``recognizes the need to determine a legal basis for
the activities of television and radio broadcasting under new
conditions'' and recommended that parliament adopt appropriate
laws, apparently corresponding to the press law passed June 12.
   That law gave non-government and non-party groups the right to
own and operate newspapers and magazines, ending what effectively
had been a decades-old monopoly held by Communist authorities.
   Growing democracy within the country requires a ``cardinal
change in the nature of the country's television and radio
broadcasting,'' said the decree, which also was carried by the
state news agency Tass.
   The guidelines for radio and television currently are set by a
state committee.
   Until now, only groups approved by the committee had access to
Soviet television. As a result, the Communist Party received large
segments of time on the airwaves.
   The decree emphasized the inadmissibility of monopolizing ``air
time by this or that party, political current or group,'' Tass
reported.
   ``For a lasting time the television was under the party
influence, what we used to call and still call the party
monopoly,'' said Nenashev, who formerly held the post of head of
the state publishing committee.
   ``Now I am more afraid of an orgy of democracy rather than the
party monopoly, when the monopoly is replaced by numerous demands
put forth by various groups, parties, various councils, various
organs,'' he said.
   Hundreds of new groups have sprung up throughout the country in
the last several years.
   A spokesman for Democratic Platform, a group of radical
reformers in the Communist Party who have announced that they are
leaving the party, praised the decree.
   ``As a whole, we ... regard this as a very positive and radical
decree,'' said Vladimir Filin. He said Democratic Platform would
work to gain access to new channels, but said the group did not
have the financial or technical means to start its own.
   ``I'm afraid it's going to be tough to get quick access to
television on the strength of the decree,'' said Vladimir
Zhirinovsky, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party, which he
claims has 12,000 members registered across the country.
   Zhirinovsky said since the press law was passed in June, putting
out his newspaper ``has become much easier in general'' because he
has the right to publish it as a person, rather than a party.
   ``As to the presidential decree (on broadcasting), I see it as a
very good thing, though I am afraid that low-level holdover
apparatchiks in the Moscow City Council will definitely try to
delay the process should my party apply for TV coverage,''
Zhirinovsky said.
   ``Let's see how this decree will be realized,'' he added.
   In addition to stubborn bureaucrats, the many new parties also
lack the money to buy time on Soviet Central Television, let alone
set up their own TV or radio station.
   In the Baltic states and other republics at odds with Moscow
over their status within the Soviet Union, elected governments have
declared that local radio and television stations belong to them.
   However, the decree emphasizes control by the Soviet government
over the legal status of radio and television stations in the
republics.

   Mayor Marion Barry, who signed a bill
scuttling the city's comprehensive overnight shelter law, had
promised to veto it after homeless advocate Mitch Snyder's death, a
Snyder associate said Monday.
   ``I was shocked that he signed it,'' said Carol Fennelly,
another homeless advocate. ``We thought we had assurances that he
wouldn't.''
   But Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said the mayor, who signed
the bill Thursday, had made no promises.
   ``He said he didn't want to mix politics with Mitch's death, and
didn't want to discuss it under those circumstances,'' Ms. Rackley
said.
   The measure authorizes the city to restrict annual spending for
shelter, limit the number of nights individuals and families may
stay at the shelters and require those with money to help defray
the cost of finding permanent housing.
   Snyder, 46, was found hanged July 5.

<HEAD>Ukraine Parliament, Following Other Republics, Declares
Sovereignty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parliament of the Ukraine, the Soviet Union's
second most populous republic, followed sovereignty decrees by
other republics and overwhelmingly declared Monday that its laws
take precedence over national law.
   The pro-independence political movement Rukh said the
sovereignty declaration was far more radical than one adopted in
the Russian republic, stating the Ukraine has the right to set up
its own armed forces, currency, citizenship and banking system in
the republic of 50 million residents.
   The Supreme Soviet parliament, meeting in the capital of Kiev,
declared the ``supremacy, independence, absolute authority and
indivisibility'' of Ukrainan authority on the republic's territory,
the Tass news agency said.
   It also called for the Ukraine's ``independence and equal rights
in external relations.''
   Its youth cannot perform military service outside the republic
without parliament's permission, the declaration said. It sets a
goal of establishing a ``constantly neutral government, which does
not take part in military blocs'' and opposes the production,
proliferation and use of nuclear weapons, according to Tass.
   The Interfax news service said the vote was 355-4 in favor of
the sovereignty declaration, with one abstention.
   Anatoly Shibiko, a senior official of Rukh, said he was
surprised the Communist faction in the parliament supported the
declaration.
   ``We expected them to kill it today, after returning from the
congress in Moscow,'' Shibiko said, referring to the 28th Communist
Party Congress. ``But now I see that Communists want independence
too, wishing to keep their power.''
   The parliament set July 16 as a public holiday in the Ukraine.
   In its declaration, the Ukraine followed other republics such as
Russia, the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia,
Uzbekistan and Moldavia that passed decrees seeking more
independence from central authority. Lithuania began the
independence movement with its March 11 declaration.
   Soviet Georgia also favors sovereignty, and last month
established a commission to work toward independence.
   Some Ukrainian nationalists support total independence for their
republic, a key industrial and farming region, but the movement is
not as far advanced as it is in other Soviet republics, such as the
Baltics.
   The debate over sovereignty in the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine
had caused sharp disagreements and last week led indirectly to the
resignation of the republic's president, Vladimir Ivashko, who then
was chosen the deputy head of the Soviet Communist Party.
   Ivashko and other deputies to the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet were
called back last week from the party congress for the debate on
sovereignty.
   Ivashko refused to go, however, and turned in his resignation.
He said he interpreted his dispute with the parliament over the
issue as indicating that he did not have enough authority to govern
the republic.
   The same day, he was nominated to be Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's Communist Party deputy, and he was elected easily.

<HEAD>Group: Unclear Israeli Firing Orders Result in Needless Deaths</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Israeli human rights group accused soldiers
of ``an itchy trigger finger'' in dealing with the Palestinian
uprising and said Monday that unclear firing orders resulted in
hundreds of unnecessary deaths.
   The army spokesman's office criticized the 60-page report by
Betselem, saying it ``contains many inconsistencies'' and was
``haughty, incriminating and one-sided.''
   The office refused to discuss specific charges, saying it could
not comment until the Supreme Court rules on a suit filed this year
challenging the army's orders in the occupied territories.
   According to figures compiled by The Associated Press, Israeli
soldiers or civilians have killed 723 Palestinians during the
31-month-old rebellion against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   An additional 236 Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs, most
on suspicion of collaboration with Israeli authorities. Forty-five
Israelis have died in the violence.
   The Betselem report said shootings by soldiers accounted ``for
the overwhelming majority'' of fatalities, and that there were
``hundreds of cases in which death could have been averted.''
   It blamed unclear firing regulations, saying they led to ``a
tangle of interpretations'' on when and how weapons can be used.
   Betselem, also known as the Israeli Information Center for Human
Rights in the Occupied Territories, was founded by liberal Israeli
legislators, academics and lawyers to investigate human rights
problems in the occupied lands. Amnesty International is among the
international groups which have cited its findings.
   ``The facts evoke an image of an itchy trigger finger, a lax
observance of regulations, the absence of exhaustive investigations
and a failure to mete out deterring and educational punishment,''
Betselem reported.
   It said these suggest ``legitimacy is conferred on unjustified
firing and violation of the law.''
   The report was especially critical of army handling of
Palestinian demonstrations, in which most deaths have occurred.
   Army orders require soldiers to fire at a demonstrator's legs
and to shoot to kill only if the soldier's life is threatened.
   The report said just one of the nine soldiers killed during the
uprising died during a riot.
   ``These figures show that no direct correlation exists between
the intensity of the danger to life and the circumstances in which
soldiers may open fire,'' it said.
   It also criticized army use of plastic bullets for punishment
and deterrence, calling this ``an extremely grave and wholly
improper usage.''
   The army introduced plastic bullets in July 1988, trying to
reduce fatalities. It says the bullets are not lethal when fired
from at least 230 feet.
   Betselem said at least 128 Palestinians have been killed with
plastic ammunition.
   Brig. Gen. Amnon Strasnov, the army's chief legal officer, told
Israel radio the army ``takes every step to decrease the number of
deaths and injuries'' and said plastic bullets resulted in ``a
significant decrease'' in deaths.
   He noted that 122 soldiers have faced courts-martial proceedings
during the uprising, 41 for illegal killing, causing death or
illegal use of firearms. Most were found guilty, he said.
   But Betselem said only two soldiers have been tried for
manslaughter during the uprising.
   Dedi Zucker, a founder of Betselem and a Parliament member from
the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement, told a news conference in
Tel Aviv on Sunday the findings suggest the army should adopt
regulations closer to those used by police.
   Police must exhaust non-lethal riot controls measures, such as
tear gas and rubber bullets, and face life-threatening situations
before they can get commanders' permission to fire lethal weapons.
   Zucker observed that Jerusalem is under police jurisdiction. He
noted it has seen considerably less violence and fewer people
killed than towns in the West Bank and Gaza, where the army
functions.
   He said, ``The police have adopted totally different criteria
and with much more success. The army should adopt the police
criteria.''

<TEXT>
   Here is the statement by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl during a live news conference Monday
from the Soviet Union on the results of his talks with Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev:
   ``Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, this press conference
concludes a two-day encounter between President Gorbachev and
myself ... an encounter that I think in the history of
German-Soviet relations produced a new high point. That covers the
depth and the intensity of our talks in Moscow, in the airplane and
here in the homeland of President Gorbachev. I understand this
invitation in his homeland as a very special gesture. ... Our talks
were marked by the greatest openness and mutual understanding and
personal sympathy. ...
   But what was special in the significance of this encounter lies
in the results.
   We are in agreement that in central issues broad-ranging
progress could be reached.
   This breakthrough was possible because both sides are aware that
in Germany and in Europe and in the Soviet Union historical
transformations are taking place that also places special
responsibility on us. ...
   As for the results of the talks, I can note:
   President Gorbachev and I are clear that the German-Soviet
relationship is of central importance for the future of our peoples
and for the fate of Europe. ... We agreed to conclude, immediately
after the unification of Germany, a comprehensive and fundamental
bilateral treaty that regulates our relationship on a long-term and
good-neighborly basis. Such a treaty should include all areas:
political relationships as well as the security of both sides;
economy, culture, science and technology, visitor exchanges as well
as many other things. The goal of this is to bring our relationship
on the basis of stability, verifiability, trust for the future.
   Our talks served to clarify basic questions that are being
negotiated in the framework of the two-plus-four talks. We have
stressed the agreement that was reached at the meeting of the six
foreign ministers at the two-plus-four talks in June in Berlin,
namely, that the two-plus-four talks should be concluded in a time
frame so that the results can be presented to the CSCE summit in
November in Paris. I can today with satisfaction and agreement with
President Gorbachev state:
   1. The unification of Germany comprises the Federal Republic of
Germany, the German Democratic Republic and Berlin.
   2. When unification is accomplished the rights of the four
powers and responsibilities will be completely removed so that a
unified Germany at the time of its unification receives its full
and unrestricted sovereignty.
   Thirdly, a unified Germany in exercising its unrestricted
sovereignty freely and by itself decide if and which alliances it
wants to belong to. That conforms with the CSCE final act. I have
explained the view of the government of the Federal Republic of
Germany that the unified Germany would like to be a member of the
NATO alliance and I am sure that this is in accordance with the
view of the German Democratic Republic.
   4. The unified Germany concludes with the Soviet Union a
bilateral treaty to carry out the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
the German Democratic Republic that should be concluded within
three to four years. At the same time we should conclude a
transitional treaty with the Soviet Union that would cover the
consequences of the introduction of the deutsche mark in the German
Democratic Republic within this time period from three to four
years.
   5. As long as the Soviet troops remain stationed on the former
territory, the German Democratic Republic, the NATO structures will
not be extended to this part of Germany. The immediate application
of Article 5 and 6 of the NATO treaty remains from the beginning
undisturbed. Unintegrated units of the Bundeswehr (the West German
army), that means units of the territorial defense, can be
stationed immediately after unification on the territory of the
German Democratic Republic and Berlin. For the period of the
presence of Soviet troops on the former territory of the German
Democratic Republic, troops from the three Western powers should
stay in Berlin after unity, according to our concept. The federal
(West German) government will ask the three Western powers about
this and will seek to conclude agreements with respective
governments to regulate the stationing (of the troops in Berlin).
   7. The federal republic of Germany declares itself ready during
the period of the Vienna negotiations to give a declaration of its
commitment to reduce the level of the armed forces of a unified
Germany from a period of three to four years to 370,000 men. The
reduction should come into force the day the first Vienna agreement
takes effect.
   8. A unified Germany will renounce the production, storage and
use of ABC (chemical) weapons and remain member of the (nuclear)
non-proliferation treaty.
   Ladies and gentlemen, this joint agreement is a very good
starting point now to be able to conclude successfully and in time
the external aspects of German unity within the framework of the
two-plus-four talks.''

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE YANKEE CAPTAINS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A whale that got tangled in a
fishing net was freed Monday by scientists who rushed to its aid
aboard a flotilla of research boats and private craft.
   ``It's swimming free into the sunset,'' said Tom Hill, captain
of the Yankee Captains out of Gloucester, as the 25-ton mammal
spouted and splashed out into the open sea.
   The five-year-old, 40-foot-long humpback had been tangled for
most of the day in a fishing net.
   The humpback, nicknamed Mallard by whale watchers, was
discovered thrashing in the water 17 miles off Massachusetts.
Rescuers could clearly hear ``trumpeting'' through the breathing
hole atop its head as it fought the net and rope running through
its mouth and around its body.
   ``It's a sign of antagonism or anxiety,'' scientist Steven
Frohock said of the sound as he waited with others for the whale to
tire so it could be approached.
   Rescue workers attached buoys to the trailing ends of the net
wrapped around Mallard, hoping the additional drag would tire the
whale, forcing it to rest on the surface.
   Thirty to 40 other whales, humpbacks and finbacks, circled and
fed in the area, keeping a safe distance from the boats. But one
whale, apparently hearing Mallard's cries, came up along side the
entangled mammal and rubbed its head.
   Leading a crew of four rescuers late in the afternoon, Charles
``Stormy'' Mayo, head of the Center for Coastal Studies in
Provincetown, Mass., approached the whales in two inflatable
motorboats. A few minutes before 5 p.m., after more than an hour of
effort, they managed to free Mallard from the plastic net. At one
point, Mayo's boat nearly overturned when Mallard reared its head.
Mayo, clad in a wetsuit, got into the water at one point, a risky
move.
   Hill a 10-year veteran of whale-watching trips, said the
rescuers would only in the most extreme circumstances get into the
water to help the whale.
   ``One swoop of a flipper and they could be dead,'' he said.
   The whale was caught in a gill net set along the seafloor on the
Stellwagen Bank to catch tuna and other fish.
   The area is frequented by whale-watching boats of by
Massachusetts companies that earn their keep by taking humans to
watch their animal cousins feed and frolic, rather than harpooning
them as in the old days.
   The mission set off Monday from Gloucester and across Cape Cod
Bay from Provincetown, Mass., after a fisherman radioed that he was
awakened in the morning by a whale thrashing next to his boat. The
whale, first recorded by whale watchers in 1986, was identified by
scars and coloring on its tail and flukes, or flippers.
   Mallard was the second tangled whale sighted in a week. Last
week, a whale known as Quixote was spotted trailing net, which the
whales hit when diving to the bottom in search of the same fish the
nets are designed to ensnare. Quixote hadn't been seen since
Thursday.
   ``It's a very precarious situation. These whales aren't very
happy to have a boat on top of them,'' said Frohock, chief
scientist of Yankee Fleet, one of the whale-watching companies.
   ``When they start thrashing around, it can be a life-and-death
situation, not only for the whale, but also for the people trying
to save him.''
   The whale _ sex unknown _ was tangled in one of the
quarter-mile-long gill nets set on the Stellwagen Bank, which is
about 17 miles off Gloucester and 25 miles from Provincetown. The
bank is 25 miles long, five miles wide has an average depth of 84
feet.
   The area is a prime fishing ground this time of year for tuna,
but it is also where fishermen catch haddock, pollock, codfish and
some of the smaller species of whiting and red fish. Whales, too,
come there for about half the year to feed.
   Lt. Glenn Miller, the U.S. Coast Guard's fisheries coordination
officer in Boston, described gill nets as similar to free-standing
chain-link fence about eight feet height and sitting on the ocean
floor. The bottom edge is weighted with lead and the upper edge has
plastic floats to keep the net upright.

   Barbara Bush choked back tears Monday as she
told a group of foster grandparents that more volunteers are needed
because so many babies are born with AIDS or addicted to drugs.
   ``We're running out of you,'' Mrs. Bush told the 26 volunteers
who came to Washington on an expense-paid trip to mark the 25th
anniversary of ACTION's Foster Grandparent program.
   ``We've got to get more help because, unfortunately, the boarder
babies and the babies that need you are multiplying,'' the first
lady said, sounding a somber note during the otherwise festive
ceremony.
   ``So we've got to work on both ends. We've got to stop them from
being abandoned and born with AIDS and coke-related problems,'' she
said, her voice faltering.
   She caught herself and added: ``I see here I'm supposed to end
with a very high, happy note, so having told you that, get out and
recruit some more. And meanwhile, happy anniversary and God bless
you all!''
   The Foster Grandparent program matches low-income men and women
age 60 or older with mentally or physically handicapped children,
youths in juvenile detention facilities, abandoned babies and
others with special needs.
   The 26 volunteers, the oldest 93 years old, represented the
current 27,000 foster grandparents and the more than 400,000 who
``shared themselves with our children over the past 25 years,'' as
Mrs. Bush put it.
   The program assigns foster grandparents to children on a
one-to-one basis after 40 hours of pre-service training. ACTION
says the typical volunteer devotes two hours daily to each of two
children.
   Mrs. Bush has visited hospitals and other facilities caring for
infants with AIDS and ``boarder'' babies abandoned by
crack-addicted mothers.
   She received a peach smock from a San Antonio foster
grandparent, as well as one for her husband.
   On a lighter note, she said: ``We Bushes ... love being
grandparents. We've been through it 12 times so far and it's gotten
to be a wonderful habit.''
   Mrs. Bush recalled how much her children enjoyed spending time
with the president's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush, now 89.
   ``They're really better people because they had the pleasure of
her company,'' she said. ``All people need that special
relationship.
   ``I'm sure you have that same wonderful effect that George's
mother had on the children whose lives you touch,'' said Mrs. Bush,
who was joined at the ceremony by William Bennett, the drug policy
coordinator.
   It was Bennett who told Mrs. Bush of the growing need for foster
grandparents.
   ``We're going to need more foster parents and grandparents
before the drug wars are over,'' he told reporters. ``And when the
drug war's over, we're still going to need them because the babies
will still be the casualties.''

<HEAD>U.S. Will Pay $25,000 to Ex-Official Charged With Spying</HEAD>

   The Justice Department will pay $25,000 to a
former official cleared of espionage allegations to head off a
lawsuit over an erroneous report about the inquiry, a lawyer said
Monday.
   Matthew L. Myers, who represents former Justice Department
official Roger Pilon, said the government issued a private letter
of apology last week and agreed to pay $25,000 to settle the
dispute.
   Pilon, former director of the Justice Department's Asylum Policy
and Review Unit, was placed on administrative leave in 1988 when he
and his wife, Juliana, were investigated to determine whether they
had passed a classified document to South African diplomats.
   The investigation did not result in criminal charges and Pilon
was reinstated in his job and his top-secret security clearance was
restored.
   But the 1988 annual report of the department's internal watchdog
unit described a different outcome when it was issued last fall.
   The report by the Office of Professional Responsibility, which
did not identify Pilon by name, said that the investigation found
``sufficient cause to terminate'' the officials's appointment.
   ``The employee resigned prior to the initiation of removal
proceedings,'' said the report.
   Pilon acknowledged to reporters who had learned his name that he
was the person referred to in the report but denied any wrongdoing.
He demanded an apology from the Justice Department, which conducted
a further inquiry into the matter.
   In its July 12 letter, the Justice Department acknowledged that
there was ``confusion created'' by the publication of the OPR
report last fall.
   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson said in the letter
that the Pilons were entitled to an apology because ``the 1988
investigation of Mr. Pilon did not produce any evidence sufficient
to warrant his dismissal from the department.''
   Gerson noted that Pilon was ``restored unconditionally'' to his
agency position and ``his subsequent resignation was self-initiated
and was not made in the face of removal proceedings (which in fact
never had been contemplated or ordered).''
   As part of the settlement, Gerson's letter will be placed in
Justice Department files, along with those at the State Department,
the FBI and the National Security Agency.
   Pilon said he suspects that the investigation may have begun
after the NSA intercepted a conversation between his wife and a
South African diplomat in New York.
   At the time, Mrs. Pilon was analyzing U.N. policies for the
Heritage Foundation.
   Pilon says he suspects his wife's conversation with the diplomat
was misinterpreted by eavesdroppers.
   According to a chronology of the case released by Pilon's
lawyer, the couple were interrogated separately but simultaneously
on Jan. 6, 1988 by the FBI.
   The Pilons have maintained that the probe cost Mrs. Pilon a
presidential nomination to be an assistant secretary of interior.
   The Pilons have denied that they gave a classified State
Department report on the influence of communism in South Africa to
a South African diplomat in New York.
   The FBI told the Pilons they had both showed ``problems'' when
they took polygraph tests, according to the chronology. But the
couple both passed polygraph tests administered by private
investigators.
   During the investigation, the chronology said, the FBI agents
told the Pilons they had ``a high degree of confidence that the
Pilons transmitted the document'' and that they had ``other
evidence.''
   But on Sept. 9, 1988, Associate Deputy Attorney General Dee V.
Benson reinstated Pilon and said in a letter that ``no implication
adverse to you should be taken from the investigations.''
   Myers said the Pilons ``had threatened to file suit unless the
department acted decisively to correct the record and to compensate
the Pilons.''
   ``In many respects, the admission of error is too little too
late. There is no reason this should have taken eight months to
resolve when the facts are as clear as they are,'' Myers said.

Monday.
   Borja will be the first Latin American chief of state to meet
with Bush since he announced a plan last month to forgive billions
of dollars in debt owed by Latin countries, said White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush's ``Enterprise for the Americas'' initiative would include
forgiving part of the $12 billion owed the United States by Latin

hemisphere-wide free-trade zone.
   In September, Bush plans to visit the South American countries

<HEAD>East Germany Admits Having Sheltered Abu Daoud</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's deposed communist leadership
sheltered Palestinian terrorists, including the man believed
responsible for killing 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympic
Games, the Interior Ministry confirmed Monday.
   Wolfgang Elstner, the ministry's director of police, said
factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization teamed up with
other terrorist groups during the late 1970s, and sought to set up
a logistical base in East Germany.
   He said records of the former secret police force _ known as the
Stasi _ showed a man known as Abu Daoud gained entry to East
Germany in 1978 and traveled to the country several times since
then.
   Elstner said Abu Daoud tried to establish contact in East
Germany with the Venezuelan terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal.
   Abu Daoud is believed to be the PLO terrorist who planned the
attack on the Olympic Village in Munich, which led to deaths of 11
Israeli athletes during a terrorist shootout with police at Munich
airport.
   The Berliner Morgenpost newspaper in West Berlin reported over
the weekend that Abu Daoud was sighted several times at the Palast
Hotel in East Berlin, and was still believed to be living in East
Germany now.
   On Monday, East Germany's ADN news agency published an interview
with the hotel's protocol manager, Reinhard Hellmann, who confirmed
that Abu Daoud was a regular guest there. Daoud used the name Tarek.
   ``We had known this Mr. Tarek for years. ... But no one knew who
this modest and utterly polite guest was,'' Hellmann was quoted as
saying.
   According to ADN, Hellmann said Abu Daoud made a ``very
cultivated'' impression and often discussed Mideast problems with
hotel staff. ``He said he was very unhappy about the discord within
the PLO.''
   Although PLO chief Yasser Arafat also stayed at the Palast
during official visits to East Berlin, he and Abu Daoud never were
guests at the same time, Hellmann was quoted as saying.
   Abu Daoud, or Mahmoud Daoud, is a senior officer of the PLO
branch Fatah. Many Fatah people were believed to have had a hand in
the Black September terrorist group that carried out some of the
most notorious attacks of the 1970s, including the one at the
Munich Olympics.
   Terrorist Carlos, whose real name is Illich Ramirez-Sanchez, is
thought responsible for the deaths of two French secret agents and
for the Dec. 21, 1975, attack on Arab oil ministers in Vienna that
killed three of the officials.
   Abu Daoud also sought to get in touch with ``anarcho-terrorist
groups from Western nations,'' said Elstner, who gave no specifics.
   Elstner said East German ports and airports were on the lookout
for Abu Daoud, but no arrest warrant was issued.
   East German's communist rulers, ousted last fall, have also been
accused of hiding Red Army Faction terrorists from West Germany.
West German news media claimed the rulers had ties with Libyan,
Basque and Irish terrorists as well.

   One of the Teenage Mutant Ninja

   Leon M. Blake, who portrays the turtle Michaelangelo in shopping

without a license in his possession. Blake, who didn't appear in
the Ninja Turtles' movie, was released Monday on $500 bail.
   Blake, whose arrest report listed ``Teenage Mutant Ninja

arrested early Saturday.
   Albemarle County Police Sgt. Sharn Perry said Blake had pulled
over to relieve himself when an officer saw him and stopped.
Authorities said Blake jumped into his van and drove off but was
stopped about 100 yards away.
   Blake, 31, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., was in town to help another

scheduled, promoters said.
   Said Perry: ``I guess it just goes to show that at 2:36 in the

   The drug epidemic in part forced the District
of Columbia to spend more on police, jails and courts than any
state, but so did footing the bill for programs states usually pay
for, city officials said Monday.
   A Justice Department report issued Sunday showed the district
had spent almost four times the national average on criminal and
civil justice in 1988, the year a crack cocaine epidemic hit the
city.
   ``Certainly, if you are comparing the states, you have to
compare apples with apples,'' said Robert Pohlman, the city's
deputy mayor for finance. ``If you are comparing the cost of our
local police force ... with a state police force, you're comparing
apples with oranges.''
   The study revealed the nation's capital, which functions as a
local and a state government, spent about $859 per resident in 1988
for police protection, courts and correctional facilities. The
national per capita average spending on justice activities by state
and local governments that year was $218.
   ``That figure is so high because we have to pay for the city
jail, plus the equivalent of a state correctional institution, and
halfway houses,'' said corrections department spokeswoman Pat
Wheeler. ``No state has to pay for all of that.''
   Wheeler said the explosion of drug use has helped drive up the
cost of corrections in Washington, but mandatory sentencing laws
have added to the price tag.
   ``We have a high incarceration rate, both because the police are
doing a good job arresting drug dealers and because we are seeing
an increase in the number of drug offenses that require the person
serve time,'' Wheeler said. ``We didn't ask for all these people _
we just lock them up.''
   But there is little question the city's budget reflects an
increasing concern about stopping crime.
   In fiscal 1980, the district spent $56.6 million to house the
4,707 inmates that spent time behind bars. In the fiscal year that
ends Sept. 30, the city is budgeting $237 million to house
prisoners. On Monday, 11,487 people were behind bars.
   Indeed, to avoid exceeding court-ordered population limits at
the city's prisons, inmates now are serving sentences in state and
federal penitentiaries as far away as Washington state.

   President Bush on Monday praised Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as a statesman for withdrawing
objections to a united Germany's membership in NATO.
   Bush said Gorbachev's action ``strengthens efforts to build
enduring relationships based on cooperation.''
   A senior White House official called Gorbachev's statement ``a
big step. It seems quite significant that they have said for the
first time that they are willing to see Germany unified in NATO.''
   Another administration official said Gorbachev's successes at
the recent Soviet Communist Party congress, where he strengthened
himself politically, had put him in a stronger position to allow
full German membership in NATO.
   ``It looks like he's coming around,'' the official said. Both
officials, insisting on anonymity, noted there still are other
problems facing German unity.
   Gorbachev announced his position in a joint statement with
visiting West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Moscow's opposition to a united Germany in NATO had posed one of
the biggest obstacles to German unification. Gorbachev had insisted
that a unified Germany be neutral or a member of both the Western
NATO alliance and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   However, the joint statement read by Kohl said, ``A unified
Germany, in exercising its unrestricted sovereignty freely and by
itself, decides if and which alliances to which it wants to
belong.''
   Kohl said he had told Gorbachev that a united Germany wants to
be part of NATO, and that he was sure East Germany agreed.
   ``Unified Germany receives complete sovereignty,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Bush, in his statement, said he welcomed Gorbachev's remarks.
   ``This comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation,''
Bush said.
   The president said Gorbachev's action ``can be seen as a
response, perhaps in part, to the outcome of the NATO summit in
London where the alliance displayed its readiness to adapt to the
new realities in Europe and reach out to former adversaries in the
East.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Paris for talks on
Germany, said, ``We have to make sure that we see exactly what was
agreed to.''
   Otherwise, Baker was extremely enthusiastic. ``This is the right
development for all of Europe,'' he said.
   In recognition of reduced East-West tensions, NATO agreed to
tailor its nuclear and conventional forces to the rapidly shrinking
military threat from Moscow.
   NATO also proposed a non-aggression declaration with members of
the Warsaw Pact and declared that nuclear weapons would be used
only as a last resort.
   Bush said the Helsinki Final Act, which ratified the post-war
boundaries of Europe, guaranteed Germany's right to choose
membership in the Western alliance.
   ``We think this solution is in the best interests of all the
countries of Europe, including the Soviet Union,'' Bush said.
   At their summit last month, Gorbachev had told Bush that he was
opposed to a united Germany belonging to the Western alliance.
However, Gorbachev did not challenge Bush when the president said,
``we are in full agreement that the matter of alliance membership
is, in accordance with the Helsinki Final Act, a matter for the
Germans to decide.''
   Based on that, administration officials began saying that
Gorbachev was leaning toward acceptance of a united Germany in NATO.
   Baker said Gorbachev's move had been anticipated, but not until
later in the summer. ``I think we should be optimistic that it
would give significant impetus to the overall process'' of German
unification, he said.
   Baker and Soviet Foreign Minster Eduard Shevardnadze will meet
Tuesday in the third in a series of talks on German unification.
The session will focus on Germany's border with Poland amid Polish
concerns that a reunified Germany might try to recover territory it
lost at the end of World War II.
   Prior to that, he will meet Tuesday with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.

   San Antonio shopkeepers mopped mud out of their businesses
Monday after storms dumped up to 14 inches of rain, stranding
people in stalled cars and forcing evacuations elsewhere in
south-central Texas.
   In the Nevada desert, flash flooding at Las Vegas killed one
person, swept away 30 cars and forced evacuation of an apartment
complex.
   Rain continued to fall Monday in San Antonio after the night of
downpours.
   ``All over town in the low-lying areas they are evacuating
people,'' said Jenny Garcia, a Dimmit County Sheriff's Department
dispatcher in Carrizo Springs. ``All morning long it's been
somebody stuck here, somebody stuck there.''
   Evacuation shelters were set up in Zavala and Dimmit counties,
where water closed several roads, authorities said.
   The National Weather Service said up to 14 inches of rain hit
Alamo Plaza in San Antonio and 11.8 inches fell in the Harlandale
section.
   Despite the downpours, San Antonio and other communities
intended to enforce mandatory water rationing that took effect
Sunday after weeks without rain. The rationing covers a
three-county area served by the Edwards Aquifer, an underground
water source for 1.3 million people.
   Downtown San Antonio shopkeepers arrived Monday to find
merchandise swept away and water soaking what was left.
   ``It looks like a wall of water came down here, not just rising
water,'' said Jim Ory, owner of a dress shop near San Pedro Creek.
Ory and his employees rushed damaged wedding gowns to dry cleaners.
   At the Operation Friendship thrift store, workers threw out
clothes. ``It's sewer water _ it smells something terrible,''
assistant manager Iris Dominguez said.
   ``Dozens and dozens'' of people around San Antonio were rescued
from cars stalled during the night by deep water, said police
assistant Sylvia Sneary.
   One mobile home washed into the San Saba River near Menard where
authorities evacuated half a dozen people.
   In Kerrville and Leming, residents cleaned up from tornadoes
that touched down Sunday in south-central Texas. Six people were
slightly injured.
   South of San Antonio in Atascosa County, people in a mobile home
park cleaned up Monday from a twister or twisters that demolished
five mobile homes. No injuries were reported, said sheriff's
department spokeswoman Ann Gates.
   The rain at Las Vegas was much less severe _ 2 inches in some
parts of the Las Vegas Valley early Monday, the National Weather
Service said. But rapid runoff on the sunbaked soil meant water ran
up to 8 feet deep in some of the washes or shallow gulleys etched
across the sloping city from west to east.
   Residents were evacuated from at least one apartment complex
near the glitzy Strip of major casinos, and most major north-south
roads were closed by water overflowing the washes before dawn.
   Bob Leinbach of the Clark County Fire Department said 30 cars
swept away in washes were checked and there were no victims trapped
inside. A woman's body was found in one wash, about a mile from her
car, police said.
   There was heavy flooding behind the Imperial Palace, where water
carried off cars and forced the evacuation of an apartment complex,
said police Lt. Randy Oaks.
   ``This is the worst one we've had this year,'' said weather
service spokesman Jim Smith.
   The storm did not faze gamblers. ``There were no gambling
interruptions here _ none,'' said Debbie Munch, a spokeswoman for
Caesar's Palace, across the street from the Imperial Palace. There
was water and mud in the driveway, ``but that didn't even stop
traffic,'' she said.

   After a spate of recent NASA embarrassments,
the Bush administration Monday ordered a review by outside experts
of the nation's long-term space goals.
   ``Space continues to be a top priority for the administration,''
said a statement released by the office of Vice President Dan
Quayle, who heads the National Space Council. ``We all want the
best ideas on how we can move into the next century maintaining our
leadership in space.''
   The review by an outside task force was not as drastic a measure
as the complete restructuring of the space agency, which had been
forecast by some news media over the weekend.
   ``Contrary to some published reports, there is no White House
investigation of NASA,'' the statement said.
   Quayle met for an hour Monday with NASA Administrator Richard H.
Truly, their third meeting in a week.
   ``Adm. Truly and the task force will report their
recommendations to the vice president,'' the statement said, but it
was not clear whether Truly would head the panel or merely appoint
it.
   Truly said in a statment that he was pleased that Quayle ``has
expressed his confidence in NASA.''
   The space agency's most recent embarrassments _ the myopic
Hubble Space Telescope and a grounded space shuttle fleet _ have
focused both public and congressional attention on NASA.
   Not since the Challenger accident of 1986, which claimed the
lives of seven crew members, has the space agency been so under
siege. Investigations so far have shown that the mistake in
grinding the lenses of the $1.5 billion telescope would have been
caught with proper testing.
   After Challenger, NASA appointed an internal investigating
board. But President Reagan also appointed a 13-member commission
of experts, headed by former Secretary of State William P. Rogers,
which held hearings and published its voluminous findings.
   The commission called the Challenger explosion ``an accident
rooted in history,'' and was highly critical of NASA for lax
oversight, poor internal communications and pressures to launch.
   Nearly all the officials who ran NASA at the time of Challenger
are gone from the agency.
   There were a number of outside investigations by Congress and by
a panel of the National Research Council, which also oversaw the
redesign of the shuttles' faulty booster rockets.
   Congress has been upset by the Hubble fiasco and by the
concurrent hydrogen leaks that caused NASA to halt all shuttle
flights.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., chairwoman of the Senate
appropriations subcommittee that has oversight responsibility for
NASA, summoned Truly and former administrator James Beggs to a
hearing Wednesday.
   Beggs had charge of the space agency a decade ago when the
telescope was built.
   The problems come at a particularly bad time for NASA, which has
had 10 successful shuttle missions since the Challenger explosion
and a spate of spectacular successes with probes to the planets.
   ``Their plate is quite full, and it's a very stressful time for
NASA,'' said Rep. Bob Traxler, D-Mich., chairman of the House
subcommittee that oversees the space and science budget.
   NASA needs congressional support to continue the $32 billion
space station scheduled for a critical design review this year, a
planned earth study called ``Mission to Planet Earth,'' and the
president's announced goal of a permanent manned base on the moon
and an expedition to Mars.
   Rep. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, was critical of the decision to
name a blue-ribbon panel.
   ``What is needed is a definition of where we are going in
space,'' said Andrews, whose district includes the Johnson Space
Center. ``We don't need another commission to start defining those
goals once again.''
   Quayle discussed the problems with Truly twice last week, once
aboard Air Force Two as he returned from the economic summit in
Houston. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu took part in the
airborne talks.
   Space News, a weekly industry newspaper, forecast in Monday's
edition that a restructuring of NASA was in the works because of
``concern that a lack of public support for space and federal
budget pressures make it difficult for NASA to carry out its
missions'' and that the White House was concerned the problems are
institutional rather than technical.

Charges</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Barry Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Monday acquitted prominent
District of Columbia contractor John B. Clyburn of four
wide-ranging bribery and conspiracy charges stemming from his
involvement in city contracting.
   Clyburn, a close friend of Mayor Marion Barry, had been accused
of working to steer city contracts to his company and to the
businesses of friends and then skimming money off the top.
   On Thursday, the same jury acquitted former top city official
David Rivers of similar charges.
   Clyburn still faces two separate trials on related matters.
   Prosecutors portrayed Clyburn as a middleman between a company
headed by an undercover FBI agent and Rivers. In court, the
prosecutors said that Clyburn had worked with Rivers and other city
officials to broker contract awards and influence jobs in the
city's human services department, which Rivers headed, and other
city agencies.
   Barry, who is on trial for drug and perjury charges, expressed
delight at the verdict in Clyburn's case.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office has waged a long and underhanded
campaign to discredit the minority business community in
Washington,'' Barry said in a statement. ``They have failed.''
   If he had been convicted of all the charges against him, Clyburn
would have faced a maximum penalty of 50 years in prison.

<HEAD>Dodge City Man Wins $35 Million from Lotto America</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dodge City, that onetime rowdy cow town, has
a modern resident with cause to go wild: the winner of the $35
million Lotto America jackpot, the largest single prize so far in
the multistate lottery.
   Dave Wagner, vice president of a cabinetry concern, bought the
$3 lottery ticket, worth six chances in the lottery, at a
convenience store where he had stopped Thursday for a cup of coffee
to go.
   Wagner, 48, was all smiles when he appeared at a crowded news
conference at Kansas Lottery headquarters.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Carol, and two daughters,
Jennifer, 17, and Courtney, 15, each holding a bouquet of
long-stemmed roses.
   ``It still hasn't set in,'' said Wagner, a lifelong Kansan.
   He said travel, expanded educational opportunities for his two
daughters and a new car or two are part of the plans he has for the
money.
   His fondness for drawing could send him on a trip to Paris to
try to become an artist, Wagner said. But for the time being, he
intends to keep his job.
   Lottery Director Gerald Simpson said Wagner will receive his $35
million in 20 annual installments, minus income taxes. Wagner will
receive his first check in the mail in about 15 days, he said, for
$1.3 million.
   The largest U.S. lottery jackpot ever was given away in the
Pennsylvania lottery on April 26, 1989, when $115 million was split
by 14 winning tickets. Numerous other states have given out prizes
upwards of $50 million.
   The Lotto America drawing was Saturday night, and on Sunday
morning, while brewing coffee, Wagner picked up the newspaper and
read the winning numbers, comparing them with those on his ticket.
   ``I just couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``I just kept looking
over and over and over. I went to the bedroom where my wife was and
said, `Come here, you're not going to believe this.' My hands were
shaking.''
   ``When he said, `I think we won,' I said, `No,''' Mrs. Wagner
said.
   ``We just sat there and looked at each other and hugged,''
Wagner said.
   About four hours later, Wagner was hit on the head with a golf
ball while playing in the Dodge City Golf Invitational, a wound
that required five stitches.
   ``It made me wonder what was I doing out there,'' Wagner said.
``I was just nervous as all get-out.''
   He said after going to a nearby hospital, he returned to finish
the tournament. One of his fellow golfers commented to him how
unusual the day had been, Wagner recalled.
   ``I thought, boy, you don't know the half of it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A man who let his 13-year-old niece drive a
crowded station wagon died Monday, the fifth passenger to die after
the car plunged into a rain-swollen creek.
   Four children were trapped in the submerged station wagon
Saturday night and drowned.
   Donald Duncan, 27, who was pulled from the creek after about 20
minutes under water, died at Lancaster General Hospital, a
spokeswoman said.
   The niece, Heather Cunrod, was driving and Duncan was in the
passenger seat helping steer when the car overshot a parking lot
and plunged into Pequea Creek, police said.
   The niece swam to shore. She was released Monday from the
hospital, where officials refused to release information about her
injuries.
   Duncan's sister, Shirley Leonard, said she had no idea why
Duncan let the girl drive.
   ``Especially with all the kids in the car. He loved them,'' Mrs.
Leonard said.
   Killed were Heather's 7-year-old sister, Jennifer, and
3-year-old brother, Timothy, and Duncan's 3-year-old son, Donald,
and 6-year-old daughter, Jessica.
   Conestoga Township Police Chief Samuel Goss said the girl told
him her uncle offered to let her drive, and everything was fine for
several miles.
   ``Heather said she had never driven a car before, that this was
her first experience behind the wheel,'' said Goss, adding that she
wouldn't be charged with a crime.
   Duncan had apparently taken the children out for a treat, Goss
said. A bucket from a McDonald's Happy Meal was found in the back
of the station wagon.
   The girl was trying to park by a boat launching spot so the
children could watch ducks, Goss said. The car entered the parking
area at up to 45 mph and went into the creek, he said.

   Storms caused flooding early Monday in south-central Texas and
in Las Vegas, Nev., and rain also was widely scattered over much of
the rest of the nation.
   Ten inches of rain fell overnight near downtown San Antonio and
across the southern section of the city, flooding highways and
downtown businesses.
   Runoff caused flooding along the San Saba River.
   Water flowed up to 8 feet deep in the natural washes or shallow
gulleys that run across Las Vegas, after up to 2 inches of rain
fell on the sunbaked desert surface. At least 30 cars were washed
away and one woman was killed.
   Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon from
central and eastern Texas across Louisiana and western Mississippi,
over Florida, the Georgia coast, eastern South Carolina and eastern
North Carolina.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms were scattered over
southern Maine, north-central and northwestern New York state,
northern Indiana and northern Illinois, northern Wisconsin and
south-central Upper Michigan, southeastern South Dakota, northern
New Mexico, south-central through north-central Colorado,
southeastern Wyoming, southeastern Arizona, central Nevada and
California.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.62 inches at Palacios, Texas; 1.51 inches at Victoria, Texas; and
0.98 inch at Galveston, Texas.
   Relatively cool air washed across parts of the southern Plains.
Record lows were posted at Abilene, Texas, at 64; Fort Smith, Ark.,
at 57, and San Antonio, Texas, at 64. Fort Myers, Fla., tied its
record of 72.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 43 at Butte and West
Yellowstone, Mont.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 at
Crescent City, Calif., to 98 at Palm Springs and Thermal, Calif.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, `Some black...,' to UPDATE with ruling on
challenge to runoff rule not expected until Tuesday at the

<TEXT>
   Andrew Young predicted Monday he will pick
up the endorsement of one of his chief white rivals if Tuesday's
Democratic gubernatorial primary leaves him in a runoff with Lt.
Gov. Zell Miller.
   Young, a former Atlanta mayor, United Nations ambassador and
congressman who is bidding to become Georgia's first black
governor, barnstormed the state Monday, as did Miller and state
Sen. Roy Barnes.
   Barnes' campaign manager, Bobby Kahn, called Young's comment
``the height of arrogance.''
   The candidates were wrapping up a gentlemanly campaign, free of
negative advertising and racial appeals. Even former Gov. Lester
Maddox, a longtime segregationist running a longshot campaign,
de-emphasized race as an issue.
   Young insisted he doesn't put much trust in polls, which have
shown Miller and Young in a close race well ahead of Barnes.
   But when asked who Barnes might support in a runoff, he was
willing to answer.
   ``I think he'll endorse me,'' Young said.
   Barnes, who portrays Miller and Young as too liberal for
Georgia, stoked endorsement speculation when he bumped into Young
at a black church Sunday. ``I like Andy Young,'' Barnes told the
congregation. ``I'm glad to be here with him today. I'm not too hot
on Zell Miller.''
   But Barnes said Monday he had not decided to endorse anyone and
was not conceding defeat.
   ``Andy and I have deep philosophical differences,'' he said. He
joked: ``I'm glad Andy's endorsing me.''
   In a speech at Augusta, Miller raised the endorsement issue.
``Already, you've got candidates wanting to make deals like it's
already over with,'' he said. ``Well it's not already over with.
The people have not spoken.''
   Georgia law provides for the top two finishers to meet in an
Aug. 7 runoff unless someone wins a majority of Tuesday's votes.
   Some black leaders, acting without Young's support, have filed a
lawsuit arguing the runoff system is unfair to blacks, who make up
about 22 percent of the state's registered voters. They asked U.S.
District Judge Richard Freeman to declare Tuesday's leader the
Democratic nominee. Freeman's staff said he wouldn't issue a
decision until Tuesday at the earliest.
   In speeches to supporters in Macon and Columbus, Young portrayed
himself as the candidate who can pull Georgians together and Miller
as a combative politician who ``doesn't get along with anybody.''
   ``I don't get along with people?'' Miller replied later. ``On
May 8 in Rome, Georgia, Andy Young said that if he were not running
he would be for me for governor.''
   Miller apparently was referring to a May 17 appearance by Young
in Rome. The Rome News-Tribune reported at the time that Young said
he'd vote for Miller if he wasn't running himself, and added: ``I
would say that I'd make a better governor, but he's a great guy.''
   Miller, meanwhile, reminded voters that he was the first major
politician to endorse a state lottery, and that he engineered a
sales tax exemption for some groceries. He repeated his promises to
lift the sales tax from all groceries, to open more boot camps for
first-time drug offenders and to cut auto insurance rates 10
percent.
   ``I've talked about things the people of Georgia can identify
with,'' he told supporters in Albany.
   Barnes continued to portray himself as the conservative
alternative to ``tax-and-spend liberals.'' Barnes, who has promised
a tax cut, also is the only major candidate who supports new
restrictions on abortion.
   As L. Douglas Wilder did in Virginia last year when he became
the nation's first elected black governor, Young championed
abortion rights.
   The most recent poll, released last week by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, found 36 percent of likely Democratic voters
favoring Miller, 30 percent for Young and 16 percent for Barnes.
   State Rep. Lauren ``Bubba'' McDonald and Maddox trailed badly in
the poll, which had a margin of error of 3 points.
   In Tuesday's Republican primary, polls have shown state Rep.
Johnny Isakson with a commanding lead.
   The current governor, Democrat Joe Frank Harris, is completing
his second term and cannot seek re-election.
   Three seats in the U.S. House also are being contested, but only
one incumbent, Rep. Doug Barnard, has opposition in the primary.
Barnard, a Democrat from Augusta, is a member of the House Banking
Committee and has been accused by opponents of being too cozy with
savings and loan officials. He faces journalism student Scott A.
Starling of Athens.
   J.B. Stoner, a white supremacist who served time for the bombing
of a black church in Alabama, is running for lieutenant governor,
but is considered the longest shot of nine candidates in the
Democratic primary.

<TEXT>
   Western nations on Monday praised President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's agreement to a united Germany belonging to
NATO as being a turning point in European history and as helping
stabilize the continent.
   In Britain, the Foreign Office said the decision was ``an
extremely positive development in Soviet thinking.''
   ``We have throughout argued that a united Germany in NATO would
be in the best interests of all those concerned,'' the Foreign
Office said in a statement.
   It added that Gorbachev was evidently swayed by a NATO summit
meeting in London July 5-6 at which the 16 leaders of Western
alliance committed themselves to limiting the size of the German
army _ a prime Soviet concern.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders also offered a
non-aggression pact to the Soviet Union and other East European
countries, and relegated nuclear arms to weapons of ``last resort.''
   France, a major West European power that belongs to NATO but
keeps its military forces outside the NATO command, made no
immediate comment. Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said he was
waiting to hear the news personally from West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   In Rome, an Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman praised
Gorbachev's position.
   ``At first glance we look on it with extreme favor,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Portugal's Defense Minister Fernando Nogueira said ``Portugal,
as a founder member of NATO, is very happy with the announcement.''
   Austria, which is not a member of NATO, said the agreement
announced during a visit by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
Moscow was ``a historic hour for Europe and for the world.''
   ``The long journey of European history in this century has
reached a very positive station,'' said Austrian Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky. ``(It is) the foundation for building a peaceful
Europe.''
   Sweden, another non-NATO member, said the agreement should also
calm Soviet fears about German military might.
   The Soviet Union endured the heaviest casualties of any nation
in World War II _ about 20 million people killed.
   ``We should not forget that for Gorbachev it means security that
Germany is in NATO,'' Swedish Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson told
the Swedish news agency TT.
   ``The Soviet Union paid a high price in the struggle against
Nazi Germany and it has probably been regarded positive that
Germany is with NATO, with the wider responsibility which the
United States and other NATO countries have.''
   NATO, in a statement from its Brussels headquarters, said
Gorbachev's acceptance of a unified Germany in the western alliance
``will increase stability for all ... including the Soviet Union.''
   ``NATO has always strongly supported Germany's desire for
unification, since unification means that the division of Europe is
also being overcome,'' the statement said.
   ``Germany's membership in our alliance will increase stability
for all. It is as much in the interests of the Germans as their
neighbors in East and West, including the Soviet Union.''
   In Bonn, the leader of Kohl's governing party said the decision
marked a ``new high point'' in German-Soviet relations.
   ``There is nothing more standing in the way of the reunification
of Germany in full sovereignty by the end of the year. The new
Europe has taken on a concrete form,'' said Volker Ruehe,
general-secretary of Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, said:
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told West German
television the most important outcome of the talks was that ``the
question ... of full sovereignty for a united Germany has been
secured.''
   In the German view, this includes an end to all remaining rights
over the now-divided nation by the four World War II victors, the
Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain.
   In Britain, the news from Moscow pushed another main story from
the top of national newscasts _ the weekend resignation of Trade
Secretary Nicholas Ridley for saying Germany was trying to dominate
Europe. He said yielding sovereignty to the European Community as
tantamount to giving it to Hitler.

<HEAD>Imelda Hires Khashoggi Lawyer for Future Legal Affairs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, facing a welter of legal problems
despite her acquittal on federal fraud charges, hired her former
co-defendant's attorney Monday to represent her in future court
proceedings.
   James P. Linn, who successfully defended Saudi Arabian financier
Adnan Khashoggi in the case that ended July 2, said he agreed to
take over ``all legal affairs'' of the former Philippine first lady.
   In a telephone interview, Mrs. Marcos said she was urged to hire
Linn by Gerry Spence, the Wyoming attorney who represented her in
the fraud trial, earning a $5 million fee.
   The Justice Department has ordered Mrs. Marcos to testify Sept.
25 before a federal grand jury in Pittsburgh investigating a
nuclear power plant built in the Philippines by the Westinghouse
Electric Co.
   The plant was built in the early 1980s when Mrs. Marcos' late
husband, Ferdinand Marcos, was president, but was never operated
because of alleged safety concerns.
   It is also the subject of a civil suit against Westinghouse by
the present Philippine government, which claims the Marcoses
accepted kickbacks in exchange for allowing construction of the
plant.
   Mrs. Marcos said over the weekend that she had no knowledge of
the case and no papers concerning the plant. Linn said Mrs. Marcos
would testify unless the government advised her that she is a
target of the criminal investigation.
   Mrs. Marcos also is involved in a number of civil cases in which
the government of President Corazon Aquino seeks to recover
millions of dollars allegedly stolen by Marcos during his 20 years
in power.
   In the fraud case, the federal court jury rejected the
prosecution's claim that Mrs. Marcos participated in her husband's
financial dealings, or that Khashoggi had falsified documents to
help the Marcoses conceal their holdings in New York real estate
and artworks.
   Linn, a former West Texas prosecutor who now lives in Oklahoma
City, led Khashoggi's defense team and will command a
multimillion-dollar fee for representing Mrs. Marcos.
   Like Spence's fee, the costs will be paid by tobacco heiress
Doris Duke, a friend of Mrs. Marcos, Linn said. Neither Linn nor
Mrs. Marcos would divulge the amount.
   She said the change in lawyers had nothing to do with the
controversy that swirled around Spence, who triggered numerous
rebukes from U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan during the trial.
   ``Mr. Spence had to go back to Wyoming where he has three
criminal cases, and he suggested Mr. Linn to take over all our
cases,'' Mrs. Marcos said. ``Mr. Spence was a good lawyer, and it
takes a lawyer to know another good one.''
   In another development, the Aquino goverment, which has barred
Mrs. Marcos' return, apparently wants to keep her half-sister, a
Roman Catholic nun, out of the country as well.
   In a cable filed July 11, the Philippine foreign ministry asked
the Philippine mission to the United Nations to add Dulce
Romualdez, known in her religious order as Sister Bellarmine, to a
``hold-order list.''
   If carried out, the instruction would mean that Sister
Bellarmine could not obtain a visa to return to the Philippines.
   Spokesmen for the Philippine consulate here said they hadn't
seen the order.
   Sister Bellarmine was among the coterie of 50 or so Marcos
supporters who attended the 10-week trial. She has lived with Mrs.
Marcos since shortly before Ferdinand Marcos died last September.

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Bar's Committee on Legal
Ethics on Monday filed a petition seeking to disbar former Gov.
Arch A. Moore Jr. because of his conviction on political corruption
charges.
   Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to felony charges of extortion, tax
fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. A federal judge
refused Moore's request to withdraw his guilty plea and sentenced
him July 10 to 5 years, 10 months in federal prison and fined him
$170,000.
   The three-term Republican governor is scheduled to enter the
Petersburg (Va.) Federal Correctional Institution July 31.
   State Supreme Court Clerk Ancil Ramey said a hearing probably
would be set on the petition in September.
   Moore signed an agreement to plead guilty to a five-count
federal indictment April 12, the same day the grand jury charged
him with one count each of extortion, mail fraud and obstruction of
justice, and two counts of tax fraud.
   The indictment said Moore extorted $573,000 from coal operator
H. Paul Kizer. In return, the governor helped Kizer's coal
companies obtain a $2.1 million refund from the state's black lung
fund, which pays benefits to miners with the respiratory disease.

<TEXT>
   A young man accused of killing and dismembering a
15-year-old runaway said he didn't realize the implications of what
he'd done until he showed a friend a gruesome souvenir, a newspaper
reported.
   The souvenir was the severed and skinned head of Stephanie Dubay.
   ``I went to the freezer and got it. It was still warm,'' Jaime
Rodriguez Jr. told The Detroit News in a telephone interview from
the suburban Macomb County Jail.
   The female friend took the head to police headquarters in Warren.
   ``When I finally realized what I had done was when she left with
the head,'' he told the newspaper.
   Rodriguez, 21, was being held without bond on charges of
first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and
mutilation of a human body in Wednesday's slaying.
   His A 15-year-old cousin, Augustine Pena, was arraigned as an
adult Monday in 37th District Court on one count each of
first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and mutilation of
a human body.
   Dubay, 15, of Clinton Township, was reported missing June 26.
She had briefly shared a Warren home with Rodriguez, the cousin and
the cousin's mother after running away from home.
   Rodriguez told The News that he has been involved in satanism
for about six years. But he said Dubay was slain on a whim, not as
part of any ritual, the newspaper reported Sunday.
   ``Me and my cousin were sitting at the table Wednesday
morning,'' Rodriguez said, according to the newspaper. ``He said,
`Let's kill Steph.' I said, `You serious?' He said, `Yeah.'''
   Rodriguez said he and his cousin went to the basement and placed
newspapers on the floor ``in case there was a mess.'' He said his
cousin went upstairs, woke Dubay and brought her to the basement,
where he held her by the neck while the cousin stabbed her, the
newspaper reported.
   Rodriguez said neither he nor his cousin verbally suggested the
dismemberment.
   ``We just read each other's minds and went for it,'' Rodriguez
said.
   Dubay was decapitated, her head skinned and placed in the
freezer. The index finger was severed from her right hand, which
also had been removed.
   ``I wanted a finger for a charm, to wear around my neck. It has
something to do with my beliefs, but not really. ... It's something
else, really, that I don't want to talk about.''
   But Rodriguez spoke in general terms about his involvement with
satanism: ``I guess I needed a new god. God gave up on me, so I
gave up on Him and went out and found a new god, one that would
love me.''
   Records show that on Aug. 30, 1987, Rodriguez's mother fatally
shot herself at their Saginaw home.
   Conviction on both the murder and conspiracy charges is
punishable by life in prison; mutilation carries up to 10 years'
imprisonment. Rodriguez said he expected to spend the rest of his
life in prison, but he expressed no remorse over the slaying.
   ``I've come close to this feeling,'' he told The News. ``It's
not a feeling of pity or remorse or anything like that. It's not
like I'm feeling bad inside for it. I'm not happy for it.''

   Iraq freed British nurse Daphne Parish from a
Baghdad prison in a surprise move Monday after she served four
months of a 15-year sentence for helping a journalist who was
hanged as a spy.
   Britain hailed the release and said it hoped this was a turning
point in the two countries' checkered relations.
   Mrs. Parish, 53, freed after pleas from President Kenneth Kaunda
of Zambia, flew in a private jet to Lusaka, capital of that
southern African nation. Zambian officials and Iraqi diplomats
presented the smiling nurse with a bouquet of red and yellow roses;
she was driven from the airport in a luxury car to spend the night
at Kaunda's official residence.
   In Baghdad, Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoun said President
Saddam Hussein decided to release Mrs. Parish ``in response to an
overture from President Kaunda and for purely humanitarian
reasons.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed delight at Monday's
development, and was grateful to presidents Saddam and Kaunda, a
Thatcher spokesman said.
   Mrs. Parish was arrested in September after driving Farzad
Bazoft, an Iranian-born reporter for the London newspaper The
Observer to the Al-Iskandaria military installation outside Baghdad.
   The Observer said Bazoft, who lived in Britain and traveled on
British documents, was trying to check out reports of an explosion.
But Iraq said he was a spy and hanged him on March 15.
   Iraq later confirmed 19 people died in an explosion at a
military installation on Aug. 17.
   Mrs. Parish worked at Baghdad's Ibn al-Bitar hospital on a
contract. Bazoft befriended her on a previous visit to Iraq.
   The Foreign Office said Mrs. Parish made a brief statement
before leaving Iraq, saying her treatment in prison was good and
she was grateful to Saddam and Kaunda.
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave said he hoped the
release was a diplomatic ``turning point.''
   ``I hope our relations, which are always liable to be a bit
bumpy with Iraq for historical reasons, are aimed in the right
direction again,'' he said.
   In April, British authorities seized huge steel tubes that were
bound for Baghdad. Officials said the parts, ordered from British
companies, could be used to make a ``super gun'' capable of hurling
shells as far as Israel.
   Iraq said the tubes were for an oil pipeline.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd appealed to Iraq on Monday to
follow up Mrs. Parish's release by freeing British businessman Ian
Richter, who is serving a life sentence in Iraq after being
convicted of bribery three years ago.
   News of her release stunned Mrs. Parish's family. ``It was just
incredible,'' said her daughter, Michelle de Vries, 22, who
returned this week from visiting her mother in Baghdad's Rashid Abu
Ghraib prison.
   ``We had no idea. Mummy had resigned herself to the fact she was
going to be there for a long time.''
   Miss de Vries spoke in a radio interview.
   Britain recalled its ambassador, expelled six Iraqi military
cadets, froze official visits and canceled a trade mission in
protest after Bazoft's execution.
   British-Iraq relations took another dive when customs officers
seized 40 components that could be used as nuclear bomb triggers at
Heathrow airport, before they could be put aboard an Iraqi Airways
flight to Baghdad.
   Zambian officials were expected to welcome positive publicity
from Kaunda's mediating role.
   Food riots and a bungled coup attempt by mutinous soldiers on
June 30, which came during calls for a return to multiparty
democracy last month, left 26 people dead in one of Africa's most
debt-ridden nations.
   Most of the dead were hit by police and army gunfire.

<TEXT>
   President Bush named former Sen. John Tower of
Texas as chairman of his Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board on
Monday and replaced all other Reagan-era members of the panel.
   In a major overhaul, Bush also cut the size of the presidential
board from its current size of 15 members to six.
   Tower, who was unsuccessfully nominated by Bush as secretary of
defense last year, was the only holdover member of the board. He
now works as a consultant in Dallas.
   Among those removed were chairman Anne L. Armstrong, the former
ambassador to Britain; former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger;
former Attorney General William French Smith; Zbigniew Brezinski,
who was national security adviser for President Carter; former
United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and former Tennessee
senator and White House chief of staff Howard Baker.
   The new board, composed entirely of defense and foreign policy
experts, consists of:
   Lew Allen Jr., former chief of staff of the Air Force and now
vice president of the California Institute of Technology; John M.
Deutch, provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
onetime undersecretary of energy; William G. Hyland, editor of
Foreign Affairs, the quarterly publication of the Council on
Foreign Relations.
   Also, Bobby Ray Inman, onetime deputy director of the CIA and
now a consultant in Austin, Texas; William J. Perry, former
Pentagon research chief and now chairman and chief executive
officer of Technology Strategies and Alliances in Menlo Park,
Calif., and Tower.
   Since taking office 18 months ago, Bush had not altered the
board makeup from the members appointed by former President Reagan.
   The changes were announced in a routine personnel announcement
that did not offer any comments by Bush.
   The board is charged with assessing the quality, quantity and
adequacy of intelligence collection, analysis and estimates. It
also evaluates counter-intelligence work.
   Members of the board serve without pay and are required to
report at least semi-annually.

<HEAD>Company Bids to Build Vegas To Los Angeles Train</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership made a formal bid Monday on a $5
billion high-speed train system that would whisk riders from
Southern California to the casinos of the Strip in little more than
an hour.
   The partnership headed by Bechtel International Inc. of San
Francisco proposed the first commercial use of magnetically
levitated trains that would run up to 300 mph on an about 270-mile
line between Las Vegas and Anaheim.
   The bid for exclusive franchise rights was hailed as a milestone
for the project, which was first proposed in 1979.
   ``We feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in
the United States,'' said Arnie Adamsen, chairman of the
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission. ``We believe we
have overcome the last true hurdle in bringing this system into
being.''
   Bechtel officials gave the commission a $500,000 deposit along
with a three-inch-thick proposal that calls for a two-way train
that would glide atop an elevated guideway running alongside
existing highways between the two metropolitan areas.
   The train could have commuter stops in Southern California, and
Bechtel proposed possible spurs that could also eventually link the
system to Palmdale, Palm Springs, Riverside and Santa Ana.
   If Bechtel gets financing and overcomes other obstacles,
construction would begin in 1993, with the system up and running
four years later.
   ``We see this as a pilot system that will be the first part of a
network that will eventually encompass the Southwest and the
nation,'' said Erv Koenig, a Bechtel vice president.
   The train would follow Interstate 15 from Las Vegas to Southern
California, where it would run alongside the Santa Ana River
Channel into a final destination at Anaheim Stadium south of Los
Angeles.
   But the project faces enormous hurdles, including its huge price
tag and uncertainty over whether it would attract enough riders to
be profitable. Since the mid-1980s, the estimated cost of the
project has risen from $2.5 billion to $5.1 billion.
   Bechtel is gambling not only that it can raise the huge amount
of money needed to privately finance the system, but also on the
use of maglev technology.
   The maglev system, which uses a magnetic field to propel the
train and to elevate it one to four inches above the guideway, is
being tested in West Germany but has not entered commercial use.
   Before deciding whether to actually build the train, Bechtel
plans to spend about 16 months on ridership studies.
   A ridership survey done for the commission said an Anaheim to
Las Vegas run would get a 6.5 million round trip passengers a year
paying $110 a ticket.
   The idea of a speedy train linking Las Vegas with the Southern
California market that provides most of it 18 million tourists each
year was first raised in 1979 by then-Mayor Bill Briare.
   The train commission was established in 1988, after a study
showed the project was feasible.

   Footage from Marilyn Monroe's last film shows
the star never missed a cue, contradicting reports that she was in

to TV Guide.
   Fox Entertainment News is scrambling to prepare footage from

scheduled to air Aug. 4, the 28th anniversary of Monroe's death,
the magazine reported in its July 21 edition.
   Those who have seen the footage say Monroe never missed a cue,
the magazine reported.
   But others interviewed for the special said Monroe, who died of
a drug overdose before the movie was finished, was losing control
of her private life during filming. The film was never completed.

   Police faked the murder of a gang member, using
makeup to create a gunshot wound and photographing the ``death''
scene in order to arrest a man accused in a murder-for-hire plot,
authorities said.
   The 24-year-old gang member, identified only as David, underwent
a two-hour makeup job to create a fake bullet wound on his left
temple and was photographed lying in the trunk of a car during the
sting operation Thursday, police said.
   The gang member had approached police after he learned he was
marked for death for allegedly stealing drug profits, said Sgt. Don
Korte.
   Warren Krugman, 47, was arrested early Friday after paying an
undercover agent who showed him a photo of the ``dead'' gang
member, police said.
   Krugman paid an eighth of an ounce of cocaine to the agent hired
as the gunman, police said.
   ``Murder for about $500 worth of cocaine. Who said life isn't
cheap?'' said Mark Shaffer, a U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms agent who posed as the hitman.
   The arrest capped a month-long investigation by Chicago police
and Treasury agents, police said.
   Krugman was charged with transfer of a firearm to commit a
violent crime and with using firearms in connection with a drug
transfer, Korte said.
   If convicted on all charges, Krugman could face 25 years in
prison. He was ordered held without bond at Chicago's Metropolitan
Correctional Center until his next hearing Tuesday.

   The Soviet Union on Monday dropped its objection
to a united Germany's membership in NATO, clearing one of the most
difficult remaining hurdles to German unification.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl announced the agreement in a televised news conference from
Gorbachev's home region, Stavropol in southern Russia. The area was
one of the deepest points of German penetration during World War II.
   The announcement capped several months of intense diplomatic
maneuvering, during which Germany backed a $3 billion bank loan to
Moscow and pushed its allies for a comprehensive plan to bail out
the crumbling Soviet economy.
   The agreement, reached in just two days of talks in Moscow and
at a country home in Arkhyz in the Caucasus Mountains, made it
likely the two German states could complete unification by December.
   ``A unified Germany, in exercising its unrestricted sovereignty
freely and by itself, decides if and which alliances to which it
wants to belong,'' Kohl said, reading a joint statement.
   He said he had told Gorbachev a united Germany wants to be part
of NATO, and that he was sure East Germany agreed.
   ``Unified Germany receives complete sovereignty,'' Gorbachev
told the news conference. ``It has the right to use this
sovereignty to make its choice ... meaning its variant of social
development, and meaning what it would like to be a part of, what
blocs to support.''
   In Washington, President Bush praised Gorbachev's remarks.
   ``This comment demonstrates statesmanship and strengthens
efforts to build enduring relationships based on cooperation,''
Bush said in a written statement.
   The British Foreign Office called the Soviet change ``an
extremely positive development in Soviet thinking.''
   Kohl and Gorbachev also reached agreement on other contentious
issues:
   _They agreed to begin negotiations on the complete withdrawal of
Soviet soldiers from what is now East German territory. The
approximately 380,000 soldiers should be withdrawn in three to four
years, they said.
   _The army of a united Germany, during the same period, will be
reduced to 370,000 soldiers. Currently, the two Germanys have about
600,000 men under arms, 480,000 in the West.
   _No NATO forces will be stationed on the territory of what is
now East Germany while Soviet forces still are there. But German
soldiers not integrated into the NATO command may be stationed
there as soon as unification is completed.
   _The rights of the four victorious World War II powers _ France,
the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union _ will cease
immediately upon unification. Such rights include military patrols
and control of air traffic in Berlin. But Western forces may remain
in Berlin as long as Soviet soldiers stay in any part of the
country.
   Kohl had been expected to make some progress on the NATO issue
in his talks with Gorbachev, but had not been expected to be able
to wrap up the entire agreement during this visit, the second to
Moscow since February.
   Although there are no such guarantees in the agreement,
Gorbachev said the Soviet Union hopes that after it withdraws from
East German territory ``nuclear weapons will not appear, foreign
soldiers will not appear, so that the budding trust, the
responsibility we have toward each other and toward Europeans, can
be preserved.''
   The Soviet Union says that more than 20 million of its citizens
died as a result of the German invasion in World War II, and for
years afterwards worries about a new German threat were cultivated
in the Soviet media.
   As the two German states raced toward reunification after the
collapse last fall of the hard-line East German government led by
Erich Honnecker, Soviet objections to NATO membership had remained
one of the main obstacles.
   East Germany had been one of the linchpins of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact, and one of Moscow's main trading partners.
   The Soviet Union first demanded that a unified Germany be
neutral, then recently approved the idea of an unspecified
associate membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   That position was rejected by West Germany and its allies. They
had insisted that Germany be a full NATO member.
   The United States argued that a united Germany would present
less of a threat to the Soviet Union if it was anchored in the
Western alliance.
   Recently, the Warsaw Pact has announced its intention to
transform itself from a military to a political organization. NATO
responded at its London summit by reducing its reliance on nuclear
weapons, reviewing the size of its forces and its military strategy.
   Kohl said the two governments would work out an agreement on the
details of the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from East Germany, and
on the introduction of the West German mark into what is now East
Germany during the withdrawal.
   The Soviet Union is concerned about the financial status of its
army on German soil. It has had agreements with East German
concerning the convertibility of its currency, but has none with
West Germany.
   East Germany began using the West German mark earlier this
month, and theoretically this could leave Soviet soldiers in East
Germany without money.

   Radical Palestinian leader Abul Abbas has
torpedoed a PLO plan aimed at reviving its dialogue with
Washington, suspended last month after an attack on Israel by his
guerrillas, senior PLO sources said Monday.
   The officials, speaking by telephone from Tunis on condition of
anonymity, said that under a compromise proposed by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid, Abbas, whose real name is
Mohammed Abbas, would resign from the Palestine Liberation
Organization's ruling Executive Committee.
   Washington would then resume the dialogue with the PLO through
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau Jr. in Tunis, and within a few weeks
elevate the level of contacts, the sources said.
   But Abbas, leader of the Palestine Liberation Front, one of nine
guerrilla factions in the PLO under Chairman Yasser Arafat,
rejected the proposal, the sources said.
   ``(Arafat's) in a corner,'' a senior PLO official said by
telephone. ``If he acts against Abul Abbas he'll appear to be
bowing to America and incense the radicals in the movement even
further. If he doesn't, the dialogue will remain severed.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said,
``We have stated very clearly what we think has to happen before we
can resume the dialogue. Those things have not changed.''
   President Bush suspended the 18-month-old dialogue June 20 after
Arafat made no apparent move to punish Abbas as Washington demanded.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said June 28 that his
government was trying to mediate a resumption of the dialogue.
Egyptian Foreign Ministry sources confirmed that the effort is
still under way.
   The United States agreed to talk to the PLO after Arafat
publicly renounced terrorism and recognized Israel in December
1988. The Americans had refused any contacts with the PLO until
Arafat met those conditions.
   The dialogue was at the time seen as a major breakthrough in the
tortuous Middle East peace process. But Israel opposed it, as did
many Palestinian radicals inside and outside the PLO.
   In the May 30 attack, Libyan-based PLF guerrillas in rubber
boats tried to land at a beach near Tel Aviv. Israeli forces
intercepted them, killing four guerrillas and capturing 12. There
were no Israeli casualties.
   Arafat's renunciation of terrorism involved halting attacks on
civilians, but not necessarily on military targets.
   Abbas said the guerrillas were aiming for a military target in
Israel even though they landed on a civilian beach.
   The sources said Abbas was to have submitted his resignation at
a meeting of the PLO's Central Council scheduled for July 18 in
Baghdad, capital of Iraq. When he refused to do so during the
weekend, the PLO postponed the meeting.
   The PLF's chief spokesman in Baghdad, where Abbas has his main
offices, said when asked if his leader planned to resign: ``This is
a baseless report.
   ``It's a fabricated story by the United States and its
cronies,'' Hussein el-Abid said.
   The Central Council is an 80-seat mini-legislature. Its members
are drawn from the 450-seat Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.
   The Central Council oversees implementation of resolutions
passed by the PNC, which usually meets once a year to map out PLO
strategy and elect the Executive Committee.
   The Central Council has no power to dismiss any of the 15
members of the Executive Committee members. If one tenders his
resignation, the council can accept it, but cannot appoint a
replacement.

   Protesters exploded
homemade bombs and battled riot police Monday in demonstrations
over President Joaquin Balaguer's disputed re-election.
   Two protesters suffered gunshot wounds in separate clashes with
police in provincial cities, according to radio and newspaper
reports.
   In the capital Santo Domingo, police in riot gear fired tear gas
to disperse students who burned tires near the state university. No
injuries were reported in the riot that reportedly involved
students hurling garbage at police.
   The demonstrations were part of a 48-hour period of ``national
mourning'' organized by Juan Bosch's opposition Dominican
Liberation Party to protest Balaguer's victory over Bosch in the
May 16 general election.
   Gen. Jose Ramon Mota Paulino, chief of the national police, said
the Caribbean island-nation of 7 million people had returned to
normal by midday, but soldiers were placed on alert.
   In Azua, 62 miles west of the capital, one youth was shot during
clashes with police, dozens of demonstrators were arrested and some
allegedly beaten, the newspaper Ultima Hora said.
   Radio Popular, an independent station, said a second man was
wounded by shotgun bellets fired by police at rock-throwing
protesters in San Francisco de Macoris, 75 miles northwest of the
capital.
   Bosch, 81, a former leftist president ousted in a military coup
in 1963, has accused Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party of
widespread voter fraud and has refused to acknowledge the
incumbent's victory.
   After a review of tally sheets, the Central Electoral Board
announced Friday that Balaguer defeated Bosch by less than 2
percent: 678,268 to 653,434, making it the closest presidential
race in Dominican history.
   The conservative Balaguer, 83 and blind, has served five
previous terms as president.

<HEAD>President-Elect Gaviria Promises to Fight Medellin Poverty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Cesar Gaviria promised
Monday to fight poverty in Medellin slums where drug traffickers
are hiring teen-agers as assasins.
   Colombia must find social solutions to the wave of terror
sweeping Medellin, Gaviria said at a news conference.
   It was his first public appearance since returning Sunday from
Europe, the United States and Venezuela. He met with President Bush
during his trip to Washington last week.
   ``The country's gravest problem now is violence in Medellin, and
this will require special treatment from my government, a treatment
that transcends just military, police and public order measures,''
he said.
   An estimated 3,000 people have been murdered in the city this
year. With 2 million people, Medellin is Colombia's second-largest
city after the capital of Bogota and is home to the Medellin drug
cartel.
   Officials say drug terrorists are responsible for the murders of
about 150 policemen in metropolitan Medellin this year.
   Gaviria, who becomes Colombia's next president on Aug. 7, said
the government will have to attack the city's poverty if it hopes
to make a dent in drug-related violence.
   Drug barons often hire teen-agers _ known here as sicarios _
from Medellin's poor neighborhoods to carry out their campaigns of
bombings and assassinations.
   ``We must establish programs to rehabilitate not only young
sicarios, but also all the young people who form part of the
subculture of violence,'' Gaviria said.
   However, the president-elect said eliminating drug trafficking
was a longterm problem requiring international cooperation to
reduce drug consumption and help cocaine-producing countries find
alternative livelihoods, he said.
   He added that the drug raids now taking place in northeastern
Colombia have not been a failure, as suggested in many news reports.
   Last week about 2,000 policemen and soldiers began combing the
area in search of Pablo Escobar, reputed head of the Medellin
cocaine cartel.
   Police said they had Escobar surrounded, but the fugitive
billionaire drug lord managed to slip away for the third time in a
year.

   Singer Harry Belafonte was admitted to a
hospital Monday after complaining of chest pains, but tests showed
the pains weren't caused by heart problems and he was released, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   ``They checked his heart and it was very strong and very
healthy,'' said Pat Story, spokeswoman for the 61-year-old singer.
``They think it must have been a muscular spasm from stress or he
may have sprained the muscle.''
   The entertainer went to the emergency room at Los Gatos
Community Hospital south of San Francisco after waking up with
chest pains early Monday, and transferred to Good Samaritan
Hospital here.
   Belafonte underwent a test that showed he was free of heart
problems, Blanche Gibberson, spokeswoman for Good Samaritan.
   Belafonte performed during the weekend at the Paul Masson winery
in Saratoga south of San Francisco. The singer canceled a Friday
show due to a throat ailment, but gave his scheduled performance on
Sunday, a winery spokeswoman said.
   Story said the entertainer planned to return to New York on
Tuesday.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in nearly three decades,
Los Angeles area residents Monday rode a commuter train to their
downtown offices.
   On the system's first business day, the Long Beach-to-Los
Angeles trains carried at least 10,000 riders, who used tickets
given away free. The 22-mile system started Saturday with a gala
attracting thousands.
   ``They had their little briefcases and were reading their papers
on the way in,'' said sheriff's Lt. Jim Holts with transit
security. ``It is an unusual sight in Los Angeles.''
   Among the commuters was Ken Mattfeld of Long Beach, who normally
takes the bus to work.
   ``The train is a lot more civilized than the bus,'' said
Mattfeld. ``I think I'll stick with this.''
   Throughout the day, there were no mechanical problems and only
one security problem, an apparently drunken man who couldn't figure
out how to get off the tracks, said Holts.
   The $877 million Blue Line marks the first stage of a 150-mile
rail system planned over the next century in Los Angeles, an
ambitious effort to pry Southern Californians from their beloved,
exhaust-belching cars.
   The $10 billion system includes the $1.3 billion Metro Rail
subway, where a fire erupted Friday in a maintenance tunnel under
construction and closed part of the busy Hollywood Freeway overhead.
   Only two lanes were open on the artery through the city's heart,
but traffic was light throughout the morning rush hour, said Margie
Tiritilli, a spokeswoman for the state transportation Department.
   The Blue Line is the first light-rail service from Long Beach to
Los Angeles since the Pacific Electric Red Cars stopped operating
in 1961, but the technologically advanced Blue Line bears little
resemblance to its noisy ancestor.
   The Blue Line's sleek, Japanese-built overhead-powered cars move
quietly. Each 87-foot-long, air-conditioned car can hold 230 people.
   The large percentage of Blue Line commuters Monday pleased
officials with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission,
which built the line.
   But officials noted the true test comes Aug. 1, when tickets go
on sale for $1.10, and in the next six months to a year, when the
system's novelty wears off.
   ``It's going to be a very long slow process to convince the Los
Angeles motorist to give up his automobile and gridlocked freeways
and give these trains a chance,'' said transportation commission
spokeswoman Stephanie Brady.

<TEXT>
   Police on Monday arrested two Spanish men
and seized $15,000 from their apartment in what police said was
Jordan's first bank robbery.
   Amman police chief, Brig. Ghaleb Zoubi, said the holdup took
place at the British Grindleys Bank in Marka, near Amman.
   The robbery was ``a unique case since it is the first in the
history of the Kingdom,'' Zoubi said. The independent Kingdom of
Jordan was established in 1946.
   One of the alleged robbers is Spanish by birth and the other is
a Spaniard of Jordanian origin, Zoubi told reporters. He declined
to identify them.
   He said the bank raid occurred at midday Sunday _ banks are open
Sunday in Jordan _ and noted both men were arrested ``less than 24
hours later.'' In Jordan banks close on Friday, the Moslem holy day.
   The suspects ``were followed all day Monday and we finally
decided to raid their homes, where we found the stolen money,''
Zoubi said in a news conference.
   He said police seized almost $15,000, which was stolen from the
bank when one ``English-speaking and bad-tempered man pointed the
gun at the bank's clerk and asked him to fill his black bag with
all the money in the cash register.''
   According to Jordanian law, non-Jordanians are usually deported
from the country after serving their sentence.

<HEAD>Somali Rulers Announce Referendum on Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Somalia's government said Monday multiparty
elections will be held in seven months and that it also has ordered
a referendum on a new constitution.
   An announcement over the state radio, broadcast from the Somali
capital, Mogadishu, and monitored by the British Broadcasting
Corp., said the government also sought reconciliation with
opposition groups.
   It said the referendum will be Oct. 31 and the long-pledged
parliamentary and local elections Feb. 1.
   Somalia on the Horn of Africa is one of the world's poorest
countries with a largely nomadic population of 5.8 million.
   The radio said the Cabinet on Thursday endorsed ``implementation
of the democratization of the country's political system'' but did
not explain why the announcement was delayed.
   ``The government ... will as a matter of urgency appoint a
committee to seek peace and reconciliation with opposition
groups,'' the radio said.
   Membership of the committee and its powers had still to be
determined, the report added.
   It said two ministerial committees were being set up to make a
``serious study of the country's internal and external policies and
the economy'' and make recommendations to the government.
   The radio said the government appointed a committee to prepare a
law covering parties and elections for presentation to the People's
Assembly.
   After army Maj. Gen. Mohamed Siad Barre seized power in a 1969
coup, the country was racked by a long territorial conflict with
neighboring Ethiopia.
   From May 1988, fighting raged in the north between the
government and the opposition Somali National Movement, with
400,000 people fleeing to Ethiopia to escape the combat. Thousands
more refugees fled to Kenya after fighting in the south between
government forces and the Somali Patriotic Movement.
   The government said last August that political parties other
than the governing Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party would be
permitted to contest the next parliamentary elections.
   Amnesty International, the human rights organization based in
London, reported last week that despite the release of hundreds of
political prisoners, hundreds more remained in jail. It accused
Somlai authorities of extrajudicial executions, torture and other
ill-treatment of prisoners.
   It said more than 200 people were shot in Mogadishu during
anti-government demonstrations last July.

<HEAD>Florida Thrift To Repay $18 Million To Federal Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Monday a Florida
savings and loan association had agreed to pay more than $18
million to settle charges that it falsely billed the Department of
Education for student loans.
   The settlement calls for Florida Federal Savings Bank of St.
Petersburg to pay $17.89 million in restitution. In addition, the
thrift must pay $150,000 to release most bank officers and
employees from liability, the Justice Department said.
   Florida Federal and one of its former officers were convicted
May 2 of 43 counts of mail fraud, conspiracy and filing false
claims. The thrift was fined $2.15 million, which is separate from
the sum agreed to in Monday's civil settlement.
   The department said in a statement that Florida Federal had
falsely claimed it had attempted to collect delinquent student
loans.
   ``Because Florida Federal made little or no attempt to collect
the loans it issued, thousands of students were unfairly tagged as
delinquent borrowers. Part of this settlement insures that they
will be vindicated,'' said Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney
general in charge of the department's Civil Division, said in a
statement.
   As part of the settlement, Florida Federal agreed to correct the
credit records of students against whom it had reported adverse
information. In addition to sending letters to credit bureaus, the
institution must advertise in local newspapers its willingness to
correct credit ratings, the agency said.
   The department said the areas covered by the newspaper
advertising will be St. Petersburg, Tampa, Orlando, Tallahassee,
Gainesville and Pensacola.
   Florida Federal will pay a majority of the $17.89 million by
agreeing not to accept legitimate reimbursements from the Education
Department. That process, which began several months ago, is nearly
complete, the agency said.
   In the May criminal case, Robert Harmas, former vice president
of the institution's student loan division, received a two-year
prison sentence.
   Another Florida Federal official, James LaMantia, was convicted
on 30 counts of fraud and sentenced to three years probation. A
third former official, Jeffrey Flatten, has been indicted on 25
counts and is awaiting trial.
   Florida Federal has been under the supervision of the Office of
Thrift Supervision for the last several months, although federal
regulators have not formally assumed control.

   The Bush administration is prepared to
open a dialogue with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
sharpest critics if they form a legitimate non-communist
opposition, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Monday.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federated Republic,
led the Gorbachev foes who quit the Communist Party during the 28th
party congress in Moscow last week and began forming a national
opposition coalition.
   Baker said it wasn't clear whether Yeltsin and the others who
quit the party ``are going to develop any kind of multiparty
democracy.''
   ``We don't know yet if that is going to happen,'' Baker said.
``If it does happen, we ought to approach it as we have in other
countries.''
   Baker expects to get a report on the congress during a meeting
Wednesday in Paris with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze.
   On Tuesday, Baker and Shevardnadze will participate in the third
in a series of talks on German unification. The session will focus
on Germany's border with Poland amid Polish concerns that a
reunified Germany might try to recover territory it lost at the end
of World War II.
   Polish Foreign Minister Krystof Skubiszewski said in Paris on
Monday that his government agrees that German unification must
precede a treaty dealing with the German-Polish border.
   Skubiszewski said Poland would not insist that such a treaty be
in place before the four World War II victors _ the United States,
Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ relinquish control
over Germany.
   Earlier, Poland had demanded the four occupying powers retain
their rights over Germany until the treaty is completed.
   Baker said the Bush administration would like to see German
unification move quickly, but that the United States has ``floated
the idea'' of not giving up control of the border until Germany
concludes a treaty with Poland.
   ``Given European history, I think it is understandable that
there is a lot of attention focused on this issue,'' Baker said
before a refueling stop here en route to Paris.
   Control over Berlin and the Polish border are the main powers
the four World War II allies have retained from the 1945 victory
agreement.
   Leaders of West and East Germany have assured Poland the border
would be guaranteed in a treaty after unification.
   Baker's offer to open a dialogue with the Soviet radical
reformers who quit the Communist Party could enhance their stance.
   The radicals, who include Gavril K. Popov, head of the Moscow
government, and Anatoly A. Sobchak, the Leningrad City Council
leader, challenged Gorbachev to move faster on free-market reforms.
They say they doubt the party is able to lead the country to
democracy and prosperity.
   Baker said the ``good news'' for Gorbachev at the party congress
was that he strengthened himself politically by fending off
conservatives who tried to slow down his liberalization programs.
   The ``bad news'' for Gorbachev is that the party split, which
tells the Soviet people that the party has failed, Baker said.
   As Central and East European states have broken away from
Moscow, Baker said, the Bush administration has established a
dialogue with opposition groups that showed democratic traits.
   Citing Bulgaria as an example, he said:
   ``We have taken care to touch base with the opposition, to make
sure that we understand where the opposition is coming from, that
they understand where we are coming from. And I don't think that's
inappropriate just because it's the Soviet Union.''

   Dry, erratic winds and high temperatures fueled a brush and
grass fire in northern California's rural Santa Clara County that
jumped fire lines and doubled in size to more than 2,000 acres by
Monday.
   Fires also burned in Yellowstone National Park, Idaho and Oregon
and Washington, but none posed immediate threats to life or
property.
   California fire officials said they expected to have full
containment of the blaze northeast of Mount Hamilton, by late
Tuesday. The mountain is 15 miles southeast of San Jose.
   ``Right now we've got a low-pressure system causing erratic
winds and fire behavior on all areas of the fire line, so that's
going to be another problem for us,'' said state forestry spokesman
Chris Morgan.
   Temperatures were in the mid-90s with 10-12 mph winds, and
efforts to contain the blaze were further hampered by rugged
terrain and dry brush, he said.
   The blaze was 65 percent contained on Monday, but Morgan said
gusty winds pushed the flames over the fire line.
   ``It doubled fairly quickly,'' he said.
   The cause of the fire, which began shortly after 5 p.m.
Saturday, still was under investigation.
   Only one building, an uninhabited log cabin, was burned.
Although there are ranches in the area, no homes were in danger.
Outbuildings were threatened if the blaze continued to spread,
Morgan said.
   Firefighters also controlled a 650-acre brush fire near Santa
Clarita in northern Los Angeles County Monday. No one was seriously
injured and no structures were burned by the blaze that erupted
Saturday afternoon at a campground, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Robert Brady.
   Firefighters in Yellowstone National Park hoped to contain one
lightning-caused fire Monday as officials watched for new fires.
   Park spokeswoman Marsha Karle said 13 firefighters remained at
the scene of the 15-acre fire Monday to finish a containment line
around the blaze. The fire was 95 percent contained, Karle said.
   Firefighters had hoped to fully contain the fire Sunday, but
several flare-ups within the containment line delayed work, Karle
said.
   In Idaho, fire bosses called in more reinforcements Monday in
their battle against a wildfire racing out of control across 120
acres east of Cascade in the Boise National Forest. Cascade is
about 80 miles north of Boise.
   ``It's expanding quite rapidly, fanned by hot temperatures and
gusting winds,'' spokeswoman Ann Finkelstein said.
   More than 100 firefighters were digging a line in the area about
17 miles east of Cascade, and another 200 men were being moved in
to bolster the attack.
   The fire erupted Sunday evening from smoldering embers left from
a lightning strike during a storm that passed through the area last
week.
   Fires triggered by lightning last week had consumed more than
4,000 acres of forests in central and eastern Oregon by Monday,
authorities said.
   One fire grew to 935 acres Monday while smoldering brush on the
Warm Springs Indian Reservation re-ignited and consumed 146 acres.
A blaze near John Day had destroyed 880 acres, according to state
and federal fire managers.
   As many as 500 fires were started by lightning strikes Wednesday
night and about 75 fires _ most of them small _ are burning in
Oregon and Washington, said Ralph Satterberg, spokesman at the
Northwest Interagency Coordination Center in Portland.

<HEAD>Serbian Communists Try To Reshape Hard-line Profile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communists ruling the Serbian
republic tried to shed their hard-line image Monday, merging with a
sister group and renaming themselves the Socialist Party.
   Serbia, largest of the six Yugoslav republics, had moved more
slowly than the others toward democratic reform.
   The new party's platform includes commitments to a market
economy and multiparty democracy. However, it retains
Communist-style calls for broad state ownership of businesses and
makes no provision for freedom of the press.
   The Socialists also kept the Communist Red Star as official
party symbol.
   The new union with the Socialist Alliance, a Communist-run mass
movement originally designed to give non-Communists a forum, was
proclaimed Monday at a hastily convened joint session of delegates
from both groups.
   The fusing of the two movements was first announced last month
by Serbia's Communist president Slobodan Milosevic. An official
statement then said the merger was motivated by a desire ``to unite
all left-leaning forces in Serbia in the face of an onslaught of
extreme rightist, anti-Communist forces.''
   ``We will not be afraid of anti-Communism; we will fight it,''
Bogdan Trifunovic, former chief of the disbanded Serbian Communist
Party, told the party's final congress Monday. The congress was
held just before the new organization was formed, with Milosevic
elected its president.
   Croatia and Slovenia, Yugoslavia's two Westward-leaning states,
this year held the first free elections here for local parliaments
in 45 years. Center-right parties won both elections.
   The states of Bosnia, Montenegro and Macedonia are due to hold
multiparty elections this fall.
   Milosevic has gained great popularity in Serbia for tightening
control over the republic's province of Kosovo, where majority
ethnic Albanians have resisted his efforts. Kosovo has been shaken
by unrest for months.
   Leaders of Serbia's illegal opposition parties have denounced
the merger as a sham intended to give Communists control over the
assets of the sister group.
   Serbia's leadership has said it will adopt a new constitution
before allowing the legalization of dozens of new independent
parties and holding free elections.
   Also on Monday, a leading ethnic Albanian dissident in Kosovo
said the region is seeking the status of a full Yugoslav republic.
   ``We are demanding independence within Yugoslavia,'' Ibrahim
Rugova, chief of the Democratic Union, told journalists in
Pristina, the province's capital.
   His group claims more than 500,000 ethnic Albanian members.
   Serbia all but abolished the autonomy of the province this
month. It considers Kosovo as ancient Serbian territory.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population in the
province, which borders Albania.

<HEAD>Woman Who Broke into Sharon Gless' House Sentenced to 6 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who broke into actress
Sharon Gless' home armed with a rifle in March was sentenced Monday
to six years in prison.
   After Joni Leigh Penn, 30, pleaded no contest to two felony
burglary charges in San Fernando Superior Court, Judge John Major
handed down the term. He had reviewed Ms. Penn's psychiatric
records and testimony including an apology from Ms. Penn to Miss
Gless.
   Deputy District Attorney Lori Dery, who pushed for the maximum
10-year term, said: ``I think the judge did what he thought was
right. ... Hopefully, she can get the help she needs while she's in
state prison. Otherwise, she is still a danger to Miss Gless.''
   Ms. Dery said Ms. Penn, who has no prior record and no history
of violence, could be eligible for parole after 40 months in prison.
   Miss Gless, an Emmy Award winner for her role in the TV
detective series ``Cagney and Lacy,'' did not attend Monday's court
proceedings.
   But her brother and lawyer, Michael Gless, said he was glad Ms.
Penn would be locked up.
   During the break-in, police said Ms. Penn told them she was in
love with Miss Gless and planned to sexually assault her, then kill
herself. Miss Gless was away from her Studio City home when the
incident occurred March 30.
   Deputy Public Defender Mitch Bruckner could not be reached for
comment. He has said previously that Ms. Penn never intended to
harm Miss Gless, but only wanted to talk to her.
   At the time of the incident, she was under a restraining order
instructing her to stay away from the actress.
   Her psychiatrist had notified Miss Gless more than two years ago
that the woman planned to shoot herself in front of her.
   Police responding to a home security alarm discovered a person
inside with a rifle. Ms. Penn surrendered peacefully to authorities
after seven hours of negotiations.

   An animal-rights activist was sentenced
Monday to 32 months in prison for trying to blow up an executive of
a company that uses live dogs to demostrate surgical equipment.
   Fran Trutt, 35, pleaded no contest in April to charges of
attempted murder, possession of explosives and bomb manufacturing.
   Trutt, of the New York City bureau of Queens, was accused of
planting a sophisticated pipe bomb near the parking space of Leon
C. Hirsch, chairman and chief executive of Norwalk-based U.S.
Surgical Corp. in November 1988. The bomb didn't explode.
   The company uses anesthetized live dogs to show surgeons how to
use its surgical staplers, instruments which some doctors use
instead of sutures.
   Superior Court Judge Joette Katz sentenced her to 10 years in
prison for each charge. The judge suspended all but 32 months of
the sentence, and Trutt is due to be released March 31 because she
has already served time while awaiting the conclusion of court
proceedings.
   Katz said she felt there was no question that Trutt ``had some
sort of evil in her mind,'' but said Trutt's intentions as well as
accusations that the company set her up to hurt the animal rights
movement ``will never be known in light of the plea.''
   Trutt had said in interviews that she wanted to scare Hirsch
rather than kill him.
   Animal protection groups at first disavowed any connection to
Trutt, saying they deplored violence.
   But activists, who have long disliked U.S. Surgical, rallied
after hearing allegations that the company had set up Trutt by
taping conversations she had with Mary Lou Sapone.
   According to Trutt's attorney, John R. Williams, Sapone was
hired by U.S. Surgical to befriend Trutt and spy on her, then later
encouraged her to proceed with the bombing despite Trutt's
reservations.
   U.S. Surgical acknowledged hiring Sapone, of Ridgefield, to spy
on Trutt after hearing of her plans against Hirsch.
   Prosecutor Bruce Hudock said during the sentencing that he had
no doubt Trutt wanted to kill Hirsch.
   ``This is punishment for someone who places human life below
that of animals and the law simply does not allow that,'' Hudock
said.
   Trutttold Katz that she feels she is a scapegoat.
   ``Here I am taking the brunt for it. This is unbelievable,''
Trutt said in a loud, angry voice.
   In a telephone interview after the sentencing, Hirsch called
Trutt a ``very disturbed woman'' and defended his company's use of
animals to develop medical tools.
   ``I think all of America has to wake up to the threat of animal
rights activists,'' he said. ``If they're successful, you can
forget about improvements in medicine or any cure for Alzheimer's
or cancer or any other disease that's still with us.''
   Trutt was also sentenced Jan. 8 in federal court in New York for
possession of two bombs found in her apartment. She received time
served and three year's probation.
   The sentence in the Stamford case includes three years'
probation following her release from the Niantic prison for women.
   The judge said that during probation Trutt must undergo
psychotherapy, and must refrain from contacting Hirsch or any
employee of U.S. Surgical.

<TEXT>
   L'ANCIENNE-LORETTE, Quebec (AP) _ A provincial police official,
speaking Monday at the funeral of an officer killed in a shootout
with Mohawk Indians, pleaded with his colleagues not to seek
revenge.
   The officer died Wednesday in a confrontation with Mohawks
opposing a golf course addition on lands they claim as ancestral
territory. The standoff continued Monday, with armed Indians of
nearby Kanesatake reserve manning barricades in Oka, a town 18
miles west of Montreal.
   Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31, died Wednesday when police tried to storm
an Indian barricade in Oka with gunfire and tear gas.
   At his funeral Monday, the director-general of the Quebec
provincial police told his fellow officers nothing would be
accomplished by seeking retribution for Lemay's death.
   ``We won't find an answer to our questions in vengeance,
retaliation or rebellion,'' Robert Lavigne said. He called for
``the calm, the lucidity and the rational approach'' that he said
had so far guided authorities in the dispute.
   Quebec's Public Security minister, Sam Elkas, has said Lavigne
ordered Wednesday's raid.
   Lavigne spoke to nearly 1,500 people, including local residents,
politicians, and police officers from as far away as New York City.
They crammed into the ornate L'Ancienne-Lorette church in the
Quebec City suburb.
   Lemay's widow, Lorraine, sat in the front row and occasionally
wiped tears with a tissue.Lemay is also survived by a 3-year-old
daughter.
   Even behind the Mohawk barricades in Oka, a flag was lowered to
half-staff Monday to mark Lemay's funeral.
   However, a Mohawk spokeswoman, Ellen Gabriel, said a settlement
is still not near. She is helping to represent the Mohawks in talks
with Quebec provincial officials.
   Other Mohawks have blocked a bridge connecting Montreal to its
southern suburbs in sympathy with the Oka Indians. Ms. Gabriel said
the Mercier Bridge will remain barricaded ``as long as our demands
aren't being met.''
   Attorney William Kunstler, a lawyer who has represented many
U.S. activists, was to fly to Montreal on Tuesday to serve as a
negotiator for the Indians, the lawyer's New York office said.
   At the blocked bridge across the St. Lawrence River, about 100
provincial officers marched in formation Monday to honor Lemay.
   They stopped in front of the police barricades and faced the
Mohawk barricades for a minute of silence.
   There were ugly scenes in that area Saturday and Sunday when
local residents gathered to protest the blockage.
   On Saturday evening, about 2,000 residents gathered at the
boundary of the nearby Kahnawake reserve and shouted racist slurs
at Mohawks.
   At one point, they burned a dummy bearing the words ``Non aux
Warriors,'' or ``no to the Warriors.'' They also chanted and waved
Quebec flags.

<HEAD>Panama Says it Will File Lawsuit Against Noriega</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian officials said Monday they
will file a lawsuit in a U.S. court seeking $5 billion in damages
from former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz told reporters he would travel to
Washington next week to file the suit, assisted by the U.S. law
firm of Williams and Connolly. Cruz said the country seeks to
recover damages caused by Noriega during his six years as head of
the armed forces.
   ``The Panamanian authorities would be absolutely irresponsible
if they did not try to recover for Panama the funds which were
obtained illegally by Noriega,'' he said.
   U.S. officials took Noriega to Florida to face trial on drug
trafficking charges after he was overthrown by a U.S. invasion last
December.
   Cruz said ``Noriega is the main theme'' of his scheduled meeting
with U.S. attorneys. ``Everything turns around Noriega,'' he said.
   Cruz said the meeting with U.S. attorneys would be aimed at
permitting both American and Panamanian justice systems to work
``more effectively in the Noreiga case.''
   Panama does not expect to recover the full amount, said
Panamanian Ambassador to the United States Eduardo Vallarino.
   ``What is being said is not that Panama hopes to be able to
collect this money,'' he said. ``Simply, what is being said to the
United States court is that this is the damage that (Noriega) has
caused to the Panamanian economy and to the country in general.''

   The leader of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
governing party Monday praised the Soviet Union's acceptance of
Germany's right to join NATO and said the decision marked a ``new
high point'' in German-Soviet relations.
   Ending two days of talks in Moscow, Kohl and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev agreed a united Germany was free to make its own
choice on joining a military alliance.
   The end of Soviet objections to NATO membership for Germany
clears away one of the major obstacles to German unification and
made it all the more certain the two Germanys will end their
40-year Cold War division in December.
   Volker Ruehe, general-secretary of West Germany's Christian
Democratic Union, said, ``There is nothing more standing in the way
of the reunification of Germany in full sovereignty by the end of
the year. The new Europe has taken on a concrete form.''
   In the German view, full sovereignty includes an end to all
remaining rights over the now-divided nation by the four World War
II allies that defeated the Nazis.
   East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere told West German
television the most important outcome of the talks was that ``the
question ... of full sovereignty for a united Germany has been
secured.''
   The four allies _ Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the
United States _ meet Tuesday in Paris for another round of talks on
the international implications of German unity.
   Ruehe said the Moscow talks were ``a new high point in the
German-Soviet relationship'' that would have ``historic
consequences.''
   ``Chancellor Kohl's visit has opened new perspectives for the
European peace order,'' Ruehe said, adding that the decision to
limit a united German military to 370,000 troops would advance the
Vienna talks on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   The two Germanys merged their monetary, economic and social
welfare systems on July 1 and have proposed all German elections on
Dec. 2 for a joint parliament in the final step to unification.

<HEAD>Education Problems Threaten Emerging Hispanic Power, Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The bleak condition of Hispanic education
threatens the emerging power of the minority group, expected to be
the nation's largest in 10 years, leaders of a Hispanic rights
organization said Monday.
   A study by the National Council of La Raza says Hispanics are
the most undereducated segment of the U.S. population.
   They continue to drop out of the nation's schools at a faster
rate than other students. And those who do stay in school have a
harder time than non-Hispanics. They achieve lower scores on
standardized tests and get less financial aid from private schools
and colleges.
   Worse, some officials say, is the council's finding that
education reforms designed to help poorly performing Hispanics have
hurt them instead.
   ``The problem is getting worse rather than better,'' said Raul
Yzaguirre, director of the council.
   He and others warned 4,000 Hispanic leaders attending the
council's annual conference that poor education could wipe out
gains Hispanics have made in business and government.
   ``It's painful to know that with all the potentials and all the
dreams ... all of it will be undercut if we cannot deal with the
question of education for our people,'' said Henry Cisneros, former
mayor of San Antonio.
   Hispanics, compared with blacks and non-Hispanic whites, enter
school later and leave it earlier. They are also less likely to
complete high school, enter or complete college, the report said.
   In 1988, the dropout rate for Hispanics at age 19 was about 31
percent, compared with 18 percent for blacks and 14 percent for
non-Hispanic whites.
   Yzaguirre said the council is worried that education reform
efforts that have swept parts of the country have forgotten
Hispanics, failing them behind just as a track coach would fail his
team if he raised the bar of the high jump and failed to train the
athletes to jump higher.
   ``Those who have had the training, the preparation, the
nutrition will jump higher than those who have not,'' Yzaguirre
said. ``That's exactly what we fear will happen to the Hispanic
community.''

<TEXT>
   Seven Cuban asylum-seekers seized
several diplomats as hostages Monday at the Czechoslovak Embassy in
Havana and then threatened to blow up the building, official news
reports here and in Mexico said.
   Czechoslavak television reported later that all six diplomats
were released unharmed by the kidnappers. The official CTK news
agency reported earlier that four diplomats had been taken hostage.
   Mexico's Notimex news agency said the captors demanded a plane
to the United States. It said five other refugees were also seized.
   It was the second such incident the past week in Havana, capital
of Communist Cuba. On Thursday, five Cubans occupied the apartment
of the Czechoslovak charge d'affaires and held him hostage a few
hours.
   A total of 15 Cubans seeking asylum had taken refuge at the
Czechoslovak and Spanish embassies in Havana. The affair has soured
Cuban relations with Czechoslovakia, which was a close ally before
last fall's democratic upheaval toppled Prague's hard-line
Communist leaders.
   The refugee crisis has also put Cuba at odds with Spain. Madrid
lodged a protest after Cuban authorities chased an asylum-seeker
onto the grounds of the Spanish Embassy and hauled him away Sunday.
Three refugees remain there.
   In his first official statement on the crisis, Cuba's President
Fidel Castro called the Cuban refugees ``anti-social elements
encouraged by Czechoslovak diplomats,'' the Czech newspaper Lidova
Demokracie said Monday.
   In its report, Czechoslovakia's official news agency said the
Czechoslovak diplomats were taken hostage when the Cubans broke
into a meeting.
   It said the Cubans acted ``very violently,'' but it was not
clear if they had weapons. The news agency said no one was hurt.
   The Mexican news agency said the seven Cuban hostage-takers had
been in the embassy six days. It said also they took five fellow
refugees captive.
   A total of 12 refugees had reportedly been holed up at the
embassy. The first Cubans arrived there July 9.
   The Czechoslovak news agency said the hostages had included Jan
Doemoek, the charge d'affaires who was held hostage at his
apartment. He escaped from the apartment, which is not in the
embassy compound.
   CTK, quoting its correspondent in Havana, also said the
hostage-takers had been holding a Foreign Ministry official who
came to Havana to try to negotiate the departure of the Cubans in
the embassy.
   Notimex, reporting from Havana, quoted unidentified journalistic
sources in saying the seven Cubans demanded a plane to the United
States. It said the hostages had been held in the offices of the
ambassador.
   It said they later shouted out a window they would blow up the
embassy if their demand for a plane was not met. They set a
deadline of 8 p.m. (8 p.m. EDT) but it passed without any explosion
reported.
   Czechoslovak TV's reporter in the Cuban capital said the seven
had barricaded themselves inside the embassy and demanded everyone
leave the embassy grounds after releasing the hostages.
   The correspondent described the seven barricaded inside as
``hysterical.''
   There was no mention in that report of other refugees being held
hostage.
   Associated Press phone calls to the Foreign Ministry in Prague
went unanswered.
   In a statement Monday night, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it
will negotiate the refugees' demands for diplomatic safe-conduct
passes to go abroad, according to Notimex.
   The statement said the Cuban government insisted the refugees
holed up in the embassy ``must leave unconditionally.''
   Czechoslovak state television quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman
Lubos Dobrovsky as saying a deputy foreign minister would leave for
Havana immediately because ``it is necessary to protect the safety
of Czechoslovak citizens.''
   Dependents of some Czechoslovak diplomats have already left
Havana. About 30 Czechoslovaks left Sunday on a regular flight, the
daily Lidova Demokracie in Czechoslovakia reported Monday. Foreign
Ministry official Jindrich Opava said they included some families
of diplomats.
   The official, however, said left at their own request _ not
under evacuation orders.
   The Cubans who broke into the charge d'affaire's apartment
remained there Monday. They have been denied asylum by
Czechoslovakia because of their actions.
   In his remarks quoted by the Czech newspaper, Castro was also
quoted as saying Cuba has no agreement on diplomatic asylum with
European countries, so their embassies have no right to grant
asylum.
   ``Czechoslovak diplomats in Havana try to interpret the
situation in a way that indicates that Cuban government should
solve the situation. ... The affair should be solved by the
Czechoslovak side,'' the daily quoted Castro as saying.
   The refugee problem poses an embarrassment for Castro, who has
resisted the reforms sweeping Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
Instead, he has continued to espouse orthodox Marxist policies.

   A Cook County Circuit judge declared a Republican
primary for a state representative's seat a tie Monday after a
daylong hearing on last week's vote recount.
   The decision by Judge Francis Barth means the state Board of
Elections will hold a lottery to determine the winner, though it's
unclear what form the lottery would take. Election officials could
not be reached at their home or office phone numbers Monday night.
   Both sides plan to appeal, depending on the lottery's outcome.
   Both candidates _ Rep. Penny Pullen and challenger Rosemary
Mulligan _ are proceeding with campaign plans on the assumption
that they will be declared the winner.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said Pullen, a seven-term representative
from the northwest suburb of Park Ridge and the leader of
anti-abortion forces in the Illinois House. ``We live to fight
another day.''
   Mulligan, a paralegal who favor abortion rights, said: ``I think
we have a lot of issues that are appealable in our favor if it (the
lottery) shouldn't go the right way.''
   The results, based on results of last week's recount, stand at
7,387 votes for each candidate.

   The Federal Aviation Administration informed
airlines of a threat against Pan Am in Europe but did not consider
the threat credible, an FAA spokesman said Monday.
   ``The FAA routinely issues information to U.S. carriers to put
into perspective rumors, news reports and other information that
may be based on erroneous information or speculation,'' said
spokesman Fred Farrar.
   Such a circular was issued July 12, he said, without describing
its contents.
   A London newspaper, the Sunday Correspondent, reported Sunday
that U.S. authorities had warned airlines of a threat to blow up a
Pan Am jet on a flight from West Germany in the next 10 days.
   The supposed threat involved a female student with a Canadian
passport who was to be duped into carrying a suitcase containing a
bomb on a Pan Am flight from either Frankfurt or Berlin.
   Farrar said information about the threat had been circulating
for several months among news organizations in Europe.
   The FAA cautioned that doubts existed about the information and
advised airlines that the agency did not consider it a credible
threat, he said.
   A Pan Am plane was blown up by a bomb in December 1988 over
Lockerbie, Scotland with the loss of 20 lives. Many authorities
believe the bombing was carried out by a terrorist group working on
behalf of Iran in retaliation for the accidental shooting down of
an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf by a U.S. warship.

   ``Mommy, mommy, come here!''
screamed Loida Gabwat, 14, after she was pulled from the rubble of
a school Monday. ``I can't go through this alone! My friends are
dead inside!''
   She was among hundreds of students and teachers inside the
Christian College of the Philippines when an earthquake struck at
about 4:30 p.m. on Monday, toppling the six-story building in this
city of 80,000 residents. The school included first grade through
the senior year of college.
   The quake measured 7.7 on the Richter scale and was centered
near Cabanatuan City, 60 miles north of Manila. It was the
strongest earthquake to hit the Philippines in 14 years, and
seismological officials said Cabanatuan had not had a major quake
since 1645.
   Early Tuesday, hospitals said 35 people had been killed in the
Cabanatuan area and 154 injured. Most casualties were from the
school but officials had no accurate breakdown.
   Officials admitted they had no idea how many were in the
building when it collapsed. Mayor Honorato Perez said Tuesday about
50 people remained buried in the rubble but fewer than half were
believed still alive.
   Rescue efforts were undertaken largely by townspeople who
flocked to the site and volunteered their services. There was
little sign of experienced supervision.
   President Corazon Aquino flew to Cabanatuan from Manila early
Tuesday to console families and visit survivors. Gov. Bren Guiao of
Pampanga province said Mrs. Aquino gave the families money and told
them ``It's already happened. Leave it to God.''
   As she met, a rescuer crawled from the rubble and told reporters
he found four boys, all alive. But he said one was pinned under the
ruins, in such pain he amputated his own leg with a jagged piece of
concrete.
   Poorly equipped local hospitals overflowed with victims.
Patients were placed on cots in yards in front of clinics.
   Lt. Benbol Moralde, part of an army contingent sent from nearby
Fort Magsaysay, said he believed few remained alive beneath the
debris.
   Moralde said victims' cries grew fainter and fainter and that he
could see bodies and parts of bodies when he surveyed the
destruction.
   Hours after the temblor, hundreds of family members and friends
watched and prayed as rescuers dug through the school rubble.
   Each time someone was brought out alive, relatives crowded
around the survivor, begging for news of those still missing.
   ``They told me she's still alive,'' said Rosa de los Reyes, who
was waiting word of her daughter, Maria Lisa, 14. ``I'm very happy
but if it turns out she has died, I think I'm going to die too.''
   Throughout the night, boys as young as seven scrambled between
slabs of concrete carrying water to victims still trapped.
Sixteen-year-old Florencio Alano crawled through the wreckage
looking for his 13-year-old brother, Cesario _ only to find out he
was dead.
   Florencio, who eventually led three survivors to safety, said:
``At first I couldn't believe that he was already dead. So I
crawled through the passageway. I saw his face and felt him. What
else can one feel but just accept it.''
   Rescuers could hear the anguished screams during the night of
those buried under tons of debris. Most begged for water. One girl
shrieked for rescuers to ``cut off my legs'' to free her.
   Miss Gabwat, a high school sophomore, said her class had just
finished a math examination when the quake struck.
   ``We were kidding each other, we were saying the test was so
easy,'' Miss Gabwat said as she rode in an ambulance to the
provincial hospital. ``Then suddenly, the walls trembled, the
ceiling collapsed and there was total darkness. We embraced each
other. We were very scared.''
   She said survivors groped for one another in the darkened rubble
and prayed aloud.
   ``We were calling out our classmates' names but they did not
respond any more,'' she said. ``Then we groped for their hands but
felt that they were cold. Each time, we wept.
   ``We were scared and some were screaming. But then later on,
they said they wanted to sleep already and rest. Then there was
silence.''
   Cenando Memping, whose 14th birthday was on Monday, said he had
just invited his three best friends to join him after class at a
restaurant when the quake hit.
   Cenando and his friends were trapped beneath tons of rubble. He
said there were 54 students in his class. More than 10 hours after
the quake, he was the only one of them who had been rescued.
   ``I prayed to God that if I survive, I'll hear Mass every day,''
he said from his hospital bed. He said his friend Michael Nuevo
joked that he would never go to a ``high'' school again.
   Moments later, Michael died, Cenando said.
   ``We were kidding each other, comforting each other,'' Cenando
said softly. ``Then suddenly, he stopped breathing. He said,
`Praise the Lord. Our Father, Our Father, Our Father.' Then he was
silent.''

   A fire halfway up the Empire State Building on
Monday evening sent flames billowing from shattered windows and
chased tourists from the observation deck and workers from
throughout the building. At least 38 people were injured, most from
inhaling smoke.
   About 150 firefighters battled the blaze, which was largely
confined to four unoccupied offices on the 51st floor, said Don
Malva, a Fire Department spokesman. Heavy smoke poured through the
middle floors of the 102-story building, and the entire tower was
cleared of tourists and late-lingering office workers.
   Josephine Danielson of New York, who was visiting the
observation deck with five friends from Spain, said they clambered
down stairways to the 70th floor, then took an elevator to ground
level.
   ``We started smelling smoke and we saw on the east side of the
building dense black smoke coming from below the tower,'' said Ms.
Danielson, an airline flight attendant. ``Whoever runs the
observation deck is tremendously unorganized. You would think they
would have had some kind of recorded announcement.''
   The fire was reported at 6:30 p.m., and by 8:45 p.m., the blaze
was out and the danger passed, Malva said.
   The fire did heavy fire damage on the 51st floor, with water
damage on lower floors and smoke damage above, said John Mulligan,
another department spokesman. The cause of the blaze wasn't
immediately known, he said.
   Thirty-one firefighters and seven civilians were injured, said
Mulligan. Twelve of the firefighters were immediately hospitalized,
the mot seriously hurt suffering from first and second-degree burns.
   Three non-firefighters were treated at the scene by paramedics,
and four were hospitalized with smoke inhalation and heat
exhaustion.
   ``Some people said they heard the alarms, others said they
didn't,'' Mulligan said. ``But we get that in every fire. There's a
speaker system and we are investigating to see how well it worked.''
   Fire Capt. Charles Kasper said the building underwent a ``brick
oven effect,'' heating up quickly. Some windows broke from the
heat, and wind surging through fanned the flames, he said.
   ``It had to be close to a thousand degrees on the fire floor,''
said Kasper. ``The nozzleman I was next to was getting burned. He
was screaming in pain but he did not let go of his hose.''
   Kasper said the Empire State Building is ``an incredibly
well-made building. If this happened in a modern high-rise
building, we would have far more problems.''
   Building employees brought people down from the deck, 15 at a
time, finally clearing the building by 10:20 p.m.
   Nabila Al Riyami, a tourist from Oman on the Arabian Sea, was
helped out, along with her husband and five children.
   ``Some people were crying and were having nervous trembling
fits,'' she said. Her husband, Said, added: ``We were praying to
God that he would help us. We are safe and we thank the Fire
Department of the municipality.''
   Fire Commissioner Carlos Rivera said flames had billowed out the
windows when the fire first broke out, but a short time later only
heavy smoke kept pouring out from some of the floors.
   The Empire State Building was the world's tallest tower until
1973 when the World Trade Center was built in Manhattan. The Sears
Tower in Chicago is now the tallest building.
   Mulligan said he believed the last blaze at the Empire State
Building was in 1988.

   Experts said the tremor was unrelated to the killer quake that
struck the Philippines Monday.
   On Monday, a small earthquake rocked buildings and frightened

<TEXT>
   President Bush and his family flew here by
helicopter Monday evening to watch the Texas Rangers, partly owned
by the president's son George, take on the Baltimore Orioles.
   The president's party sat with Orioles owner Eli Jacobs ina
skybox behind home plate, leaving after six innings with the score
5-5. The Orioles won 7-6 when the Rangers' Brad Arnsberg walked in
the winning run in the ninth.
   Making the trip with the president were his wife, Barbara, sons
George W. and Marvin and daughter Dorothy LeBlond, as well as
several spouses and grandchildren.
   It was Bush's first outing of the year to Baltimore's Memorial
Stadium but he saw the Rangers in Toronto at the Blue Jays' home
opener in April. He attended a minor league game in Hagerstown, Md.
on his way to the presidential retreat at Camp David last month.
   The president is an avid baseball fan who played first base and
captained a Yale University team that competed for the college
championship in 1947 and 1948.
   He has attended several Orioles games as president, taking a
baffled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to one.
   Each team has been struggling this season, although the Rangers
recently put together a seven-game win streak that the Detroit
Tigers snapped Sunday.
   The Orioles went into the game in fifth place in the American
League's East division, seven games under .500 and 7{ games behind
the division-leading Boston Red Sox.
   The Rangers went into the game in fifth place in the West
division, two games under .500 and 12{ games behind the Oakland
Athletics.

<HEAD>California High Court Rejects Breakup of Freedom Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court rejected legal
moves by minority stockholder Harry Hoiles that might have led to
the breakup of the Freedom Newspapers group.
   In a unanimous decision July 11, the justices denied a hearing
on an appeal by Hoiles from a lower-court ruling that upheld
actions by relatives who hold controlling shares in the
family-owned company, based in Orange County.
   The dispute dates to 1981, after the death of Clarence Hoiles,
Harry's older brother and head of the 29-newspaper company.
   Harry Hoiles claimed his sister, Mary Jane Hoiles Hardie, had
promised to back him as Clarence's successor. When she refused,
Harry talked to possible buyers for his one-third share, including
Times-Mirror Corp.
   The Hardies and the family of Clarence Hoiles, who each also
control about one-third of the company, offered to buy out Harry
Hoiles' shares at a discount. Harry said the $74 million offer was
37.5 percent of the shares' market value in 1981.
   The majority also adopted a stock restriction to give family
members the first chance to buy majority shares. Harry Hoiles was
not re-elected to a three-member executive committee.
   His suit claimed his relatives' actions took unfair advantage of
their majority status and denied him fair value for his stock. He
sought a court order liquidating the company or requiring the
majority to buy his stock at market value.
   Orange County Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein ruled in
favor of the majority stockholders and was upheld April 27 by the
4th District Court of Appeal.
   ``Equity does not require the majority to submit to corporate
blackmail at the whim of a minority, any more than it will permit a
majority to take unfair advantage of a minority,'' Justice Thomas
Crosby wrote for the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Reporter Released From Jail After Revealing Source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television reporter jailed for refusing to
identify a confidential source emerged free from a courtroom July
10 after giving the judge his source's name.
   KMOL-TV reporter Brian Karem said the source released him from
his promise of confidentiality after the U.S. Supreme Court
declined his second request to be freed.
   ``I want to see my wife and my son and take a day off and eat
some pizza and drink some beer and never wear orange again,'' Karem
said after his release.
   The journalist, who wore an orange uniform during his two weeks
in jail, was held in contempt of court and sentenced to six months
in jail for refusing to say who helped arrange a telephone
interview last year with jailed murder suspect Henry David
Hernandez.
   Hernandez and his brother, Julian, are charged in the March 1989
shooting death of a police officer. Henry David Hernandez told
Karem he shot the policeman in self-defense.
   Lawyers said they needed to know who arranged the interview to
determine whether it could be admitted as evidence.
   Karem identified the source as Deborah Ledesma, a cousin of
Hernandez's. He handed over a notebook page containing names and
phone numbers of those who helped set up the interview.
   He said he agreed to keep Ms. Ledesma's name secret because she
feared some of Hernandez's family members.
   The reporter said he would go to jail again if it meant keeping
a promise to a source. ``I didn't intend to prove anything. I just
intended to keep my promise, so I kept my promise,'' he said.
   He accused lawyers of using him to do their investigative work.
   ``The press should be the last place that prosecutors and
defense attorneys go to seek their information _ not the first,''
Karem said. ``They never tried anyone else before they came to me.''
   Karem lost two Supreme Court bids to remain free while he
appealed the contempt of court citation.

<HEAD>David Duke Helps Paper That Wouldn't Run His Campaign Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State Rep. David Duke helped kill
legislation that might have financially harmed a small-town
newspaper that has refused to run his political ads.
   Duke, who frequently criticizes the media for mentioning his
past neo-Nazi ties and Ku Klux Klan leadership, declared his
devotion to safeguarding press freedom July 9 as he moved to kill a
bill aimed at The St. Helena Echo.
   The legislation would have allowed local governments in St.
Helena Parish to pick a newspaper from outside the parish as the
parish's official journal _ the publication that prints, for a fee,
government notices, minutes of public meetings and other government
information.
   ``This is a danger to freedom of the press,'' said Duke. ``I
suggest the danger of this amendment and this bill is to prevent
people from publishing. It's become political.''
   He then moved that the House put off consideration of the bill,
a motion that carried 50-36. The 1990 session adjourned a few hours
later without the bill coming up again.
   Told of Duke's action, Echo Publisher Harrell Griffin said he
was amazed. ``I don't know what to think about that,'' he said.
``I'm flabbergasted.''
   Griffin and Duke have been at odds for months, ever since
Griffin refused to run ads for Duke's U.S. Senate campaign.
   He accused Duke of trying unsuccessfully to organize an economic
boycott of the Echo. Duke said he never tried to organize a boycott
but did advise his supporters of the Echo's refusal to run his ads.
   Griffin said he wouldn't question Duke's motives, but added he
didn't believe Duke had given up racist philosophies.
   Asked if he would change his mind about running Duke's ads,
Griffin said: ``I'd have to think long and hard on that. It makes
me think better of him for having done this.''
   Griffin said the legislation could have put the Echo, one of six
small papers he publishes, out of business if it resulted in his
losing the $17,000 worth of government business it gets each year.
   He blamed the mostly white St. Helena power structure for
persuading Rep. Buster Guzzardo and Sen. B.B. ``Sixty'' Rayburn to
sponsor the legislation. He said the leadership doesn't like his
support of black residents' causes in the parish, where almost half
the registered voters are black.
   Guzzardo said the bill wasn't intended to put the Echo out of
business but was aimed at making Griffin bid competitively with
other papers for government business.

<HEAD>Young Read Books, While Their Elders Read Newspapers, Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older people are more avid newspaper readers
than young people, but the young are more apt to be reading books,
a report said July 15.
   And people with children are more likely to watch the Sunday
morning news interview shows on television than people without.
   These tidbits are from a new study by the Times Mirror Center
for the People and the Press called ``The American Media: Who
Reads, Who Watches, Who Listens, Who Cares.''
   The study divides people into four groups based on the interest
they show in the news.
   Twelve percent are ``news sophisticates'' who form the regular
audience of National Public Radio, public television's
``MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' and such magazines as the Atlantic,
Harpers and The New Yorker.
   Thirty-nine percent don't quite make news sophisticate but
nevertheless read a news magazine or a major metropolitan daily
newspaper or watch Sunday morning interview shows or Cable News
Network. They are called serious news consumers.
   Forty-one percent, the largest group, are moderate consumers who
regularly read a daily paper or watch or listen to the news.
   The remaining 8 percent do not read a daily newspaper or watch
or listen to the news regularly.
   The report said 41 percent of the non-news users and 16 percent
of the news sophisticates are in the 18-29 age bracket.
   The analysis was based on 4,890 telephone interviews conducted
in the first four months of this year. The margin of error was plus
or minus three percentage points.
   The survey found that 24 percent in the 18-29 bracket said they
had read a daily newspaper the previous day. This rose to 61
percent for people older than 80. The percentage increased steadily
with age, except for a slight slump among people in their 70s.
   Forty-three percent of people under age 30, one of every two
people in their 30s and 40s and 44 percent of people 50 and older
said they listened to news on the radio regularly.
   For television, the percentages were 63 percent under 30, 71
percent in the 30s and 40s and 84 percent at age 50 and over.
   Five percent of childless people said they watched the Sunday
interview programs regularly. This rose to 11 percent for married
couples with children and 12 percent for single parents.
   Thirty-eight percent of people 18 to 29 said they were reading a
novel or other book. This increased to 39 percent among people in
their 30s and 41 percent for readers in their 40s.
   After that it dropped off to 35 percent for the 50s and 70s, 31
percent for the 60s and 29 percent for people over 80.
   The habit of watching CNN regularly rose from 21 percent in the
youngest age bracket to 28 percent for people in their 50s and 60s.
It dropped to 22 percent for viewers over 70.

<HEAD>Would-Be Groom Figures Print Proposal Proper for Editor's Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ted Vagelos figured the proper way to
pop the question to an editor's daughter was in print.
   So he took out a quarter-page ad in The Knoxville News-Sentinel
on July 15.
   ``Dear Tina, Will you marry me? Love, Ted,'' the $1,274 ad asked
in big bold letters.
   The proposal surprised both Tina Moskos and her father,
News-Sentinel editor Harry Moskos. But Vagelos' timing was apt,
since Tina's parents celebrated their 28th wedding anniversary the
same day.
   Ms. Moskos accepted. The wedding will be early next year.

<HEAD>Summit Reporters Are Target of Houston's Salesmanship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the world's spotlight remained trained on
the deliberations of seven Western leaders, the city of Houston
plied the news media for its share of attention.
   About 4,000 reporters came for the economic summit July 9-11,
and civic leaders spared no effort to put them in a good mood about
the city.
   ``We specifically asked for the opportunity to host the economic
summit because we wanted the chance to focus the worldwide
attention on what is happening here in Houston,'' Mayor Kathy
Whitmire said.
   ``We felt that there ought to be some way that we can take
advantage of your presence here,'' she said.
   Boosters invested hundreds of thousands of dollars to present
reporters with free food, alcohol, T-shirts, tote bags and even
toothpaste. That's become the standard formula for any city playing
host to pre-eminent news events like summits, political conventions
or sports extravaganzas.
   Houstonians made no secret of their motives.
   ``Frankly, the people from Washington told us early on that the
media attitude at previous summits was affected by the preparation
and presentation of the food,'' said Ben Love, a retired bank
chairman who helped organize the media center.
   But Houston was miffed when the three television networks turned
a cold shoulder to hot Houston and chose not to broadcast their
news shows from the summit, a snub that was front-page news locally.
   And when Whitmire and some pillars of the community staged a 9
a.m. summit news conference July 10 in an auditorium that can hold
more than 1,000 people, 50 civic boosters outnumbered the handful
of reporters.
   ``I've heard ... you (reporters) stay up pretty late at night
and maybe don't get up so early in the morning,'' Love said. ``This
may be some confirmation of that.''
   No matter. The tiny turnout wasn't cause for concern.
   ``When I see 10 or 11 television cameras across the back of the
room, I'm very much aware of the potential they have for reaching
very large numbers of people,'' Whitmire said. ``You don't have to
have large numbers to impress me.''

<HEAD>Black Coalition Plans Newspaper for Detroit Suburb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of black community groups
in this Detroit suburb announced plans for a black-owned and
-operated newspaper.
   The paper has yet to name editors and officers, set subscription
costs and determine frequency of publication. Leaders of the Civic
Citizens Coalition said it should hit the streets in mid-August.
   About 30 percent of Southfield's 80,000 citizens are black.
   Other groups already publish papers based in Southfield,
including the weekly Jewish News and the Chaldean Detroit Times.
Black-owned newspapers are published in at least two other Detroit
suburbs _ Ecorse and Highland Park _ and the Detroit-based Michigan
Chronicle is the state's largest black-oriented newspaper.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Goes to Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the U.S. newspaper empire he built on junk
bonds and panache crumbling, it's not surprising Ralph M. Ingersoll
II has retreated to Europe to pick up the pieces.
   Ingersoll, whose newspaper holdings grew fast the past five
years and shrank even faster earlier this month, always considered
himself an odd duck among American publishers.
   He's been described as worldly, soft-spoken, debonair,
continental and global. Some acquaintances just call the
44-year-old entrepreneur a European kind of guy.
   He speaks several languages, went to school in Switzerland,
wears English suits, married a German, drives a German car and
writes dates the European way _ 2 July 1990.
   July 2 was a dramatic turning point for the media company
started by Ingersoll's father, a respected editor who got into
publishing in the late 1950s.
   Ingersoll announced a trans-Atlantic swap with investment
partner E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. He gave up all his American
newspapers and became sole owner of his European newspaper group.
Ingersoll had controlled 10 American dailies and dozens of weeklies.
   The swap left Ingersoll with a much smaller, less-indebted
business that includes morning, afternoon and Sunday newspapers in
Dublin and three dailies and 39 weeklies in England.
   Ingersoll said he's happy with the deal.
   ``I think it was natural and basically inevitable,'' he said in
a telephone interview. ``We had a philosophical difference. I saw
great opportunity in Europe. They weren't really interested.''
   He said the key to the deal for him is that he's severing his
ties with Warburg Pincus, his investment partner since 1983.
   Under his original agreement with that firm, Ingersoll was
obligated to share 50 percent of the profits of any acquisition or
deal he made.
   ``Now I'm free to negotiate with individual investor groups for
each individual deal. That's the way my father and I did it for 25
years, and that's the way I'm going to do it now,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, a basic question lingers: How much choice did
Ingersoll have?
   ``What's happening, I think, was basically forced upon him,''
said John Morton, a media industry analyst for Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan.
``But I guess with his affinity for Europe, it might make it easier
to swallow.''
   Others say Ingersoll welcomes the chance to escape the recession
that has hit American newspapers. Ingersoll said he talked with his
partners about the trans-Atlantic swap last year and had been
watching the European market for eight years.
   ``Ralph always said there were greater opportunities in Europe.
He always expressed a strong interest over there. I think this move
is consistent with his thinking,'' said Tom Tallarico, ex-publisher
of the short-lived St. Louis Sun.
   The Sun was supposed to be a revolutionary tabloid designed to
show growth was possible in a stagnant industry. After seven
months, it folded with a loss of at least $25 million.
   Ingersoll, who used some of his own money to start the paper,
said he stopped publishing because of inadequate street sales.
   Analysts said he was forced to pull the plug because of his
weighty obligations in junk bonds. By some reckonings, Ingersoll's
U.S. newspaper network amassed debts exceeding $700 million.
   A month before the Sun's demise, Ingersoll offered to repurchase
$240 million worth of junk bonds at deep discounts to avoid
defaulting on upcoming interest payments. He got a poor response.
   ``Everyone in the industry said the St. Louis Sun was ill-fated
from the start,'' said Kenneth Berents, an analyst with Alex Brown
&amp; Co. in Baltimore. ``And it's interesting that had he not gone out
on a limb for the Sun, he might not be having the problems he's
having today. The Sun may have cost him his whole empire.''
   Ingersoll said the junk bond troubles had nothing to do with his
decision to give up the U.S. holdings, and he's not sure where the
Sun fits into the picture.
   ``It didn't figure in it directly, but I suppose it may have had
some type of metaphysical impact on what Warburg Pincus was
thinking, but it's hard to say,'' he said.
   It's difficult to say much about the internal finances of
Ingersoll's companies because they are privately owned, but it's
clear things haven't been easy since the Sun stopped publishing
April 25.
   ``I think the failure of the Sun affected him more than anyone
thought. It disenchanted him with American newspapers,'' said Kevin
Horrigan, the Sun's lead columnist, who was lured away from the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch. ``Ralph felt he had something to contribute
and was basically told, `No thanks.' ''

<HEAD>Wisconsin Paper Resumes Free Obituaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAUSAU, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wausau Daily Herald is publishing free,
detailed obituaries again after 2{ years of charging for them.
   The policy cost the paper too many advertisers and subscribers,
Publisher Fritz Jacobi said July 11.
   ``If a business decision is so unpopular that emotions are so
strong more than two years after its implementation, then I think
it's time to review that policy,'' he said.
   LeRoy Yorgason, executive director of the Wisconsin Newspaper
Association in Madison, said fewer than a dozen of the 37 daily and
218 weekly newspapers in Wisconsin charge for obituaries.
   In December 1987, the Herald began charging families for
obituaries that included the deceased's job, survivors,
contributions to the community and other pertinent information. The
publisher at the time said the change would generate income and
follow a practice at other newspapers of publishing for free only a
death notice with information about the funeral.
   Readers _ 55 letters to the editor in less than six weeks _
complained that free obituaries with some life history had been a
tradition at the paper, which Gannett Co. Inc. bought in 1980.

beating death of a 3-year-old girl, The Bridgeport Post has offered
a $5,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case.
   The girl was found badly beaten in her home Dec. 15. She died a
week later and the death was soon ruled a homicide, but police did
not request autopsy results for four months.
   ``What happened to Brenda Lee Hart and the apathy that followed
her death epitomizes the problems that stalk the city of
Bridgeport,'' Post Publisher Dudley B. Thomas said July 11. ``Not
only did she suffer a terrible death, but nobody gave a damn. We
decided to become Brenda Lee Hart's advocate.''
   According to the autopsy report, the girl was the victim of
systematic abuse that may have begun soon after birth.
   In a front-page editorial, the Post said: ``Shame on the city of
Bridgeport. More city residents turned out in recent years to
protest a proposed Little League complex for the city's North End .
.. than have voiced outrage about the rising number of homicides in
Bridgeport and the death of this defenseless child.''
   The editorial also criticized the police investigation, the
police board president and the state's attorney for their handling
of the case.

<HEAD>19th-Century Farmhouse To Be Moved for Newspaper Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richmond Newspapers Inc. angered
preservationists with a plan to move a 19th-century farmhouse
standing in the way of a $195 million production plant.
   ``If that decision is carried out, it will prove to be a very
unpopular one,'' said Robert B. Giles, an official with one of the
12 preservationist and historical groups battling the company over
the house's fate.
   The company said July 12 that Lockwood, the suburban farmhouse
that was Gen. Robert E. Lee's field headquarters for four days in
1864, would be dismantled and moved about 12 miles north.
   The house, built in the early 1800s, stands within 50 feet of
where the company is building its new plant.
   Executives said the house would be given to a couple who plan to
reconstruct it.
   The company said it would provide a grant of up to $50,000 to
help with the project. J. Stewart Bryan III, publisher of the
Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader, said an
architectural and engineering firm agreed to provide free
engineering and architectural help on the project.
   ``This will ensure the continuity of a family owning and living
in this house,'' said Bryan, who also heads Media General Inc.,
parent company of Richmond Newspapers.

<HEAD>Six Times Reporters Produce Book on Brawley Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six journalists from The New York Times have
collaborated to produce a book on the Tawana Brawley case that
reportedly will detail how she concocted her story of being
gang-raped.
   Bantam Books is releasing the 408-page work, ``Outrage: The
Story Behind the Tawana Brawley Hoax,'' on Aug. 15. Its authors are
Robert D. McFadden, Ralph Blumenthal, M.A. Farber, E.R. Shipp,
Charles Strum and Craig Wolff, who either wrote or edited a series
of articles on the case for the Times.
   Brawley, a black teen-ager, gained national attention in
November 1987 when she reported a gang of white men, including one
man wearing a badge, had abducted and raped her. A grand jury later
concluded she made up the story.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Newspaper's Decision To Reject Gay Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court ruled July 10 that a
newspaper can refuse an advertisement for gay and lesbian services
and is not subject to a law regulating public access to businesses.
   The 3rd District Court of Appeals ruled the Green Bay
Press-Gazette could not be forced under the public accommodations
law to accept classified ads without discretion.
   That law makes it illegal to deny full and equal enjoyment of
any public place of accommodation or amusement because of sex,
race, color, creed, physical condition, developmental disability,
sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry.
   ``We conclude that to be a place of public accommodation under
the public accommodation act, the business must be comparable to or
consistent with the business enumerated in the statute itself,''
the appeals court said.
   ``Newspapers do not offer the public `accommodations' in the
sense that this term is normally understood,'' it added.
   The decision affirmed a summary judgment by a trial court in
favor of Gannett Co. Inc., owner of the Press-Gazette.
   The case stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Jay Hatheway, doing
business as Among Friends, and Peggy and Tracey Vandeveer.
   According to court records, one proposed ad by Hatheway read in
part, ``Gay-lesbian resources, referrals, networks for rural
Wisconsin.'' The Vandeveers attempted to place a classified ad that
offered ``unique, hand-painted sweatshirts for lesbians.''
   The newspaper said it rejected the ads because the ads contained
the words ``lesbian'' and ``gay.''
   In its decision, the appeals court said it was not examining the
constitutional implications ``that a contrary decision would have
involved'' if the newspaper were forced to accept the ads.

<HEAD>Ruling Limits Access to Transcript in Child Sex Abuse Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court denied a New York
newspaper access to a full transcript of the child sex abuse trial
of a former day care teacher.
   The court, in a 5-2 decision July 9, agreed with a trial court's
ruling that the Village Voice was entitled only to a version of the
transcript with the names and identifying characteristics of the
children and their families deleted.
   Laura Handman, an attorney for the Voice, said the newspaper had
not decided whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We believe that a redacted transcript would be very difficult
to understand because of all the deletions, given the numerous
children,'' Ms. Handman said of the transcript, which exceeds
30,000 pages.
   ``It would be very hard to follow which child we are talking
about,'' she said.
   The teacher was convicted in 1988 of 115 counts of sexually
abusing 19 children, aged 3 to 5.
   The Supreme Court's ruling addressed the issue of whether the
Voice was entitled to receive edited or unedited transcripts of the
10-month trial, which generated extensive news coverage.
   To accommodate First Amendment rights while protecting the
privacy of the young victims and their parents, the trial court
allowed the media full access to the trial but prohibited
publication of the names, addresses or other identifying
characteristics of the children and their families. The trial court
also ordered that all transcripts be sealed.
   No representative of the Voice attended the trial, but two
months after the trial ended, the newspaper sought to obtain an
unedited version.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Refusal To Release Employee Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers have no right to a list of
state employees with details of their work history, the state
Supreme Court ruled.
   The Providence Journal-Bulletin had asked the state Department
of Administration for information on employees affiliated with the
Rhode Island Federation of Teachers and the National Education
Association of Rhode Island.
   John J. Kane, director of the agency, refused to turn over the
information, saying it was too personal.
   The Journal-Bulletin and Bruce Landis, a staff writer, wanted
``information that will uniquely identify state employees by name,
address, and employee number'' as well as ``employment history,
qualifications, job classification, relationship to the civil
service system, minority and other special status, position by
agency and by other identifiers, work schedule, the components of
their pay, their pay and overtime history, vacation and sick leave
status.''
   The newspaper also asked for data on the employees' ``history of
personal actions beginning with fiscal 1985-86, including both
present and former state employees, recounting their comings and
goings and how their status changed in-between.''
   The Journal-Bulletin maintained it was entitled to the
information under the state's Access to Public Records Act.
   Kane offered only to produce information available to the
general public, including an employee's name, position, agency
assignment, salary and date of employment.
   The newspaper sued Kane in Superior Court in March 1989. The
judge there ruled the records were ``personnel records relating to
identifiable individuals'' that are exempt from the public records
law.
   The Supreme Court upheld the lower court's ruling, citing its
previous ruling involving the Pawtucket Teachers Alliance.
   In the Pawtucket case, a teachers' union sought records of the
Pawtucket School Department to investigate a school principal's
performance.
   In that case, the Supreme Court ruled ``the Legislature did not
intend for the act to allow the public carte blanche to rummage
through all publicly held documents.''

<HEAD>County Workers Ordered Not To Talk to Reporters</HEAD>

   Hamilton County commissioners ordered
department heads and employees who report to them not to talk to
reporters and to refer all media inquiries to County Administrator
Thomas W. Wenz.
   The policy applies to all staff, including the directors of the
budget, purchasing, human services, public works and county
building departments.
   Commissioner Robert A. Taft II said July 9 that the policy
applies only to matters pending before the county commission, not
to all information. ``General requests for public information'' may
be handled by departments without consulting Wenz, Taft said.
   Wenz said the policy was not a new one, but simply a formal
outline governing existing practices by county employees.
   He said he did not foresee any penalty for county employees who
did not follow the policy.

<HEAD>Complaint Filed After Newspaper Distributes 2 Live Crew Lyrics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper's distribution of lyrics
from a 2 Live Crew album that a Lee County judge declared obscene
sparked a citizen's complaint to the State Attorney's Office,
police said.
   In a front-page editorial last month, Everett Landers, executive
editor of the News-Press, offered free copies of the lyrics to
anyone over 18 who stopped by the newspaper's office and requested
them.
   A Feb. 8 ruling by Judge Isaac Anderson made it a misdemeanor
offense to sell the Miami-based group's recording ``As Nasty As
They Wanna Be'' to adults and a felony to sell it to minors.
   A federal judge in Fort Lauderdale later ruled the recording
obscene, and members of the rap group have been arrested on
obscenity charges.
   A spokeswoman for the state attorney's office said prosecutors
would investigate to see whether state law had been violated by the
News-Press.
   Landers referred all questions to his lawyer, Steve Carta, who
was unavailable for comment. A News-Press receptionist said the
company had run out of copies of the lyrics and didn't plan to
print more.
   In his editorial, Landers said that ``unbending advocates of
free speech often find themselves having to defend things they find
offensive.'' He said people, not the news media, should make a
decision on what is obscene.
   ``We bow to that logic, in this case, not low enough to print
the lyrics on our pages but to a middle ground'' _ of distributing
the lyrics, the editorial continued.

<HEAD>Organization of Church Publications Protest Baptist Suppression</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization of Protestant, Roman Catholic
and Eastern Orthodox publications strongly protested restrictive
moves on the Southern Baptist news agency and ouster orders against
its top editors.
   ``We are alarmed that responsible and respected journalists have
been penalized and dismissed for their proper reporting of the
news,'' officers of Associated Church Press said in a letter to
officials of the Southern Baptist Convention.
   The organization represents 195 periodicals of various
denominations and independent religious publications.
   The letter, dated July 10, was sent to the Rev. Morris H.
Chapman, new president of the Southern Baptists, who are now
controlled by a fundamentalist wing, and to its executive committee.
   The committee has scheduled a special meeting for July 17 to
deal with the chief editors of Baptist Press, Al Shackleford and
Dan Martin, who were given an ultimatum to resign or be fired. The
men refused to quit.
   The agency, which serves 38 weeklies of the 14.9 million-member
denomination and also about 400 other news outlets, has been
prohibited in the meantime from carrying news of the affair.
   Declaring the step ``adversely affects the credibility of
religious journalism in North America,'' Donald F. Hetzler,
executive director of the transdenominational press group, and its
president, Mary Lou Redding, wrote:
   ``What makes this situation especially regrettable is that
Southern Baptist Press has earned a high degree of credibility and
trust among secular press agencies for its open, balanced reporting
of controversial matters.''
   Chapman has declined comment on actions against the news agency
editors, but said ``the feeling has surfaced ... that there seemed
to be a bias that leaned toward the moderate perspective in the
convention.''

<HEAD>More Changes Planned for Entertainment Weekly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The new managing editor of Entertainment Weekly
says readers can expect more changes at the 5-month-old magazine,
which has become one of the industry's most closely watched
launches.
   James W. Seymore Jr. took over the top editorial post at the
Time Warner Inc. magazine last month after the founding managing
editor, Jeff Jarvis, resigned over ``creative differences'' with
senior management.
   Entertainment Weekly has commanded intense interest because it
is the first weekly from Time since the costly failure of TV-Cable
Week magazine in 1983.
   The heart of the magazine has been reviews of entertainment
products _ television, movies, music, videos, books and magazines.
Feature stories focused on how the products were made, not gossip
about the celebrities in them.
   Seymore said in an interview that reviews would remain the
centerpiece. But he said he wants more feature and news coverage of
entertainment, such as the magazine's recent stories on TV's use of
FBI videotapes of Washington Mayor Marion Barry's drug arrest.
   Seymore also wants more information on the opinion pages to help
readers decide what might be worthwhile to watch, read or hear. And
he said readers can expect shorter reviews and features.

   When a lightning bolt
sent flames crackling from a cottonwood tree in Yellowstone
National Park, half a dozen firefighters responded within minutes.
   They were too late; the fire had been reduced to embers by heavy
rain from the storm that got it going. But ever since blazes
blackened nearly half of Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres during the
dry, hot summer of 1988, even a single burning tree quickly draws
firefighters' attention.
   The heavily criticized ``let it burn'' plan under which fires
caused by nature were left untouched unless they endangered people
or structures has been suspended and is under review.
   This year, firefighters have fought about a dozen fires, most of
which were a quarter-acre or smaller and several of which involved

   The Navy, responding to congressional calls
for military spending cuts and leaner armed forces, is starting an
enlistment program allowing some sailors to put in only two years
of active duty.
   The program is geared toward attracting ``the college-bound
kid'' who is interested in earning benefits for higher education
and seeing something of the world before starting school, said Vice
Adm. Jeremy Boorda, the chief of naval personnel.
   ``We're looking for high school graduates,'' Boorda said in a

people who may not want to make the Navy a career.''
   Instead of attracting young men and women for a normal four- or
six-year enlistment with the promise of high-tech training, the new
program enlists sailors for ``general detail,'' the deck and
engineering assignments that are often dirty, labor-intensive and
hard to fill.

McCartney and his wife, Linda, looked out their kitchen window as
they ate lunch and saw their sheep in the field. It was the last
time they ate meat.
   ``If animals could speak, I think they'd tell us not to eat
meat,'' Linda McCartney said. ``We are such a pompous race of
humans. We're so destructive, so sad. People dream of heaven and,
you know, we're living in heaven, but we make it hell.''
   Her family's change in diet was influenced more by animal rights
than by health. But whatever the motivation, McCartney preaches
vegetarianism. To that end, she has written ``Linda McCartney's
Home Cooking,'' already published in England and to be issued Oct.
31 in this country by Arcade Publishing, $24.95.
   ``I did the cookbook for one reason, I love animals. And to pass
on the recipes to my kids and friends,'' McCartney said from New
Jersey, where she was with her husband's band at a stop on a world
tour.
   Even on the road, which is where the McCartneys have been for a
year, no meat or fish is served to the 180 people on the touring
staff.
   ``This whole tour is vegetarian,'' and those who at first were
skeptical have been converted, she said.
   ``People think of vegetarians as cranks, they eat radishes and
lettuce,'' said McCartney, who calls herself an instinctive peasant
cook. ``They don't realize, you eat better as a vegetarian. Nothing
suffers, and you eat better. You only cut out decaying flesh.''
   Many of her friends had doubts. But she and her family are
healthy, and friends who give up meat soon say they feel better,
she said.
   But it's not an easy change.
   At first, McCartney said, she ate lots of quiches and macaroni
and cheese. At restaurants, the choices were ratatouille or
omelets. Then, she began cooking with soybean imitation meats,
called texture vegetable protein. Now, she uses much less of that
and relies more on produce, legumes and dairy products.
   TVP, sold in health food stores and some supermarkets, is shaped
like various meat products _ bacon, burgers, sausage _ and ``tastes
exactly like meat,'' said McCartney, who added she has fooled many
guests with it.
   She suggests TVP is a good way to help convert a family to
vegetarianism.
   ``Everybody bases their meal around a chop or a leg or a
thigh,'' and with TVP no one will think something's missing, she
said.
   In her book, McCartney adapts vegetarianism to a decidedly
British eating style, with a proper English breakfast of vegetable
sausages alongside fried eggs, a ``festive Sunday roast'' made from
vegetable burgers and sausages with stuffing, a suet-free Christmas
pudding, and even a shepherd's pie without beef.
   ``I haven't written this book in order to be acclaimed as a
great cook _ like everyone I've had my share of disasters in the
kitchen. I'm simply doing it for the animals,'' she wrote in her
introduction.
   Most of the more than 200 recipes in the book are geared toward
beginners. They appear simple to prepare and were chosen from
McCartney's years as a home cook. Yes, although she surely can
afford to stay out of the kitchen, McCartney said she and her
family (Paul plus four children) have always spent a lot of time
there.
   McCartney even discusses ways to involve reluctant husbands and
children in food preparation. (Paul bakes bread.)
   ``I've never had a cook. I've never had a nanny, either. I love
my kids. I'm sort of very womanly that way,'' said McCartney, who
also is a photographer and plays keyboards with her husband's band.
   Vegetarianism takes a sense of awareness, she said. McCartney
grew up ``a real meat eater,'' never connecting the horses she
loved with the horsemeat that was fed to her dogs.
   ``I think we're going through a food revolution and people will
realize that meat is disgusting, or I should say, flesh is
disgusting. We cover everything up. We call pig a ham.''
   Humans should take their cue from animals such as gorillas or
elephants, she said. ``Strong animals don't eat meat. I think we
have a whole false thing about meat.''

<HEAD>Gordon Humphrey Hits the Dump Circuit in State Senate Campaign</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEERFIELD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of these weekends there may be a
political collision at a small town dump, a good place to find
voters on a summer Saturday.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey says he'll be working the dump circuit
as he campaigns to swap his seat in the U.S. Senate for one in the
New Hampshire Legislature.
   So will John L. Sherburne, seeking to move from the New
Hampshire House to the state Senate seat Humphrey wants.
   In the era of campaign consultants, television commercials and
image makers, the contest for the Republican nomination in New
Hampshire's 17th Senate district is a clash of cultures as well as
candidates.
   While Sherburne tries to broaden his constituency, Humphrey has
to narrow his focus to line up primary election support in the 14
towns that make up the largely rural district, where most voters
know him from afar.
   In the Republican primary two years ago, 4,444 voters turned
out. There'll probably be more this time, perhaps as many as 6,000.
   Humphrey's campaign mission is easier because people know his
name. He says he is campaigning intensively for the $100-a-year
seat in the Legislature at Concord, knowing that nothing would
alienate voters faster than for him to act as though he thinks the
job is automatically his.
   ``Whatever the outcome, nobody will say that Humphrey didn't
work his butt off,'' the senator said.
   Besides, the outcome is no sure bet, despite Humphrey's
advantages.
   ``We've been going all-out for a long time,'' Sherburne said one
evening last week, talking politics across the kitchen table at his
Deerfield farmhouse, his home for 20 years after a career in the
Air Force. ``We obviously have a name recognition problem.''
   He's working on it, with a network of volunteers trying to make
his name and face known by word of mouth and campaign T-shirt,
while he visits general stores, volunteer fire stations, wherever
there might be a voter or two.
   ``You've got to go out and root them out, meet them, find them
at the dump,'' Sherburne said. ``It's real basic, actually.''
   ``I don't think either one of us is going to see very big
crowds,'' said Humphrey, contrasting his campaign past with his
current objective. But he said the only fundamental difference
between running for the U.S. Senate and campaigning for the state
Senate is that some of the issues are different.
   Some are not, notably taxes and abortion, topics on which
Humphrey and Sherburne differ sharply. Humphrey, one of the most
conservative of Senate Republicans, is a leading abortion foe;
Sherburne favors abortion rights and says the issue doesn't belong
``in the realm of politics.''
   New Hampshire has no general income or sales tax. Sherburne
favors a statewide referendum on taxes. Humphrey insists the
Legislature should hold firm against a sales or income tax.
   ``It's a good fight, and I want to go back and fight it,''
Humphrey said in an interview in his U.S. Capitol office, a
hideaway where he works at two computer terminals. New Hampshire's
24 senators share office space and staff help.
   ``I'll miss all these goodies,'' Humphrey said, surveying the
windowless office he calls his cockpit, two blocks from his Senate
office building suite. ``I'm building my own little cockpit in my
barn back home.'' His home is in Chichester.
   Humphrey, 49, was a pilot on a commuter airline before his upset
Senate election in 1978. He was re-elected comfortably in 1984. He
had said from the start that he would serve only two terms.
Preaching what he practices, he is pushing a proposed
constitutional amendment to limit congressional service to 12
consecutive years. Humphrey said he will keep up that campaign from
New Hampshire.
   He has some other campaigns in mind, too. He says he will try to
help other conservatives get elected to the Legislature. Humphrey
would like to run for president of the state Senate next year.
``I'm certainly interested,'' he said.
   Beyond that, he said, ``I'm interested in running for governor.
I'd like to offer myself as a candidate some time.''
   Says Sherburne:
   ``He's trying to use this for higher office. A lot of people
tell me they resent that. ... He expects to walk right into office
and some people don't take kindly to it. He's a little gruff and
demanding.''
   Sherburne, 66, was a combat pilot in two wars, later an aide at
the Pentagon. He's served eight years in the state House, 12 as a
selectman in Deerfield.
   Humphrey began his campaign with a letter to district
Republicans saying he needed notarized signatures from 500 of them
by mid-June ``in order to qualify for the ballot.'' That's not
quite so. He needed the signatures because he did not accept the
state's optional campaign spending limit, $15,000 for the Senate
contest.
   The senator said 1,100 people signed his petitions, voters who
presumably will be back to support him in the primary. Humphrey
said he doesn't expect to spend more than the limit, but wants the
flexibility to do so if abortion rights organizations go after him.
   Sherburne agreed to the limit, and said his campaign probably
won't spend that much.
   ``Don't see it's necessary, actually,'' he said.

   Adjusting the spray upward also gets rid of insects. ``Bugs are
smart. They lay their eggs on the underside of the leaf out of the
rain. So we got smarter and spray from the bottom, washing off the
eggs. This reduces use of pesticide to a sixteenth of what the bag
label recommends.''
   Another sermon in Robbins's ministry is low-tillage farming:
LISA, low input sustainable agriculture. Leaving corn stubble in
the field retains snow melt, impedes rain runoff, cuts herbicide
use by two-thirds, means only five tractor trips across a field a
year instead of eight or 10 _ and saves water.
   Bruce Unruh farms 2,000 acres of wheat, corn and sunflowers and
is a prize pupil of Robbins. ``I used to pump 90 to 120 days a
season. Last year I ran the pivot 39 days.'' He uses gypsum blocks
_ only 2 percent of Ogallala farmers do _ which measure soil
moisture ``like a fuel gauge and tell me when to irrigate.''
   LEPA and LISA farming are more management intensive. ``But
instead of five operations with the tractor before planting at 10
acres an hour, now I have one.''
   Another of Robbins's proteges is growing corn over in Nebraska
on 6 to 8 inches of irrigation instead of 2 feet. ``You got guys
running pumps all summer. That's what everybody told them to do.''
   Much of the hope for the future of the aquifer, in Robbins'
view, lies in a change of farmer mentalilty. ``Farmers think in
terms of yield, not profit. The whole purpose of farming is to make
enough to support your family. If you can reduce the cost, you do
it better.''
   ``In the coffee shop, farmers are always talking about how many
bushels they got per acre,'' Unruh says. ``But it's how much money
you net that makes you sucessful or not.''
   ``Farmers have a tilling addiction,'' Robbins says. ``They get
the shakes if the tractor isn't running. Sun's up, you gotta be
driving. Sun's down, go to bed. It's a problem to program older
farmers. They think it's a sin to sit down. But we know how to farm
with less manpower, less water and more profit.''
   ``We've been mining the aquifer, using it up, marketing water
through a crop,'' says Lyle. ``We got 172 bushels of corn on our
fields with 5.5 inches of irrigation, vs. 24 bushels dry farming.
For an additional 12 inches of water we added 14 bushels, so in
effect we gave away the 12 inches.''
   But the most persuasive missionary for sensible water use is a
farmer looking over his fence at a more prosperous neighbor.
   ``We had 16 LEPAs in this county last year,'' Robbins reports.
``By the end of this year there'll be 100.'' It costs up to $9,000
to convert a $50,000 pivot to LEPA. It is an investment in the
future.
   ``If there were no pioneers in this country, we'd still all be
sitting on Plymouth Rock,'' says Wes Robbins, visionary. ``We
haven't begun to scratch the future out here.''
   ``I seriously think we have the technology right here today to
cut the amount of water we're using by half in Texas and parts of
Nebraska,'' says Lyle. ``I believe the Ogallala could be
self-sustaining if we cut back on water and concentrate on
profitability instead of yield.''
   He mentions technology:
   _ A new cotton plant that uses 20 percent less water.
   _ An improved pivot whose segments move uniformly in tandem,
spreading water and chemicals more efficiently.
   _ Improved management by irrigating in alternate furrows with
diking to retain water
   _ An improved nozzle that sprays in a sheet instead of more
erosive droplets.
   In Imperial, Neb., district water manager Ron Milner foresees
irrigation technology that will reduce water on crops by two-thirds.
   But in Greeley County in western Kansas, ``the horse has already
left the barn,'' says Keith Lebbin, water manager in Scott City.
``A new proposal would limit 12-section areas to 641 acre feet of
water. But permits are already in existence for 8,191 acre feet.
What do you do: sue everyone to take away their property rights?
What's the cost of that?''
   The U.S. Geological Survey had predicted the water table in the
corn and cow belt of the Upper Republican River in Nebraska would
drop 90 feet by 2000. The actual decline has been only 1.5 feet
annually, a projected 15 feet by century's end. ``With irrigating 8
to 10 inches a year, the Ogallala here could be self-sustaining
with recharge from rain and surface water,'' Milner predicts.
   A 1982 study for the U.S. Department of Commerce forecast a 25
percent fall in water levels in the Ogallala by 2020 if no
conservation steps were taken. Irrigated farming would decline
sharply from Kansas to New Mexico and ``increase greatly'' in
Nebraska. A more regulated use of the aquifer would reduce
predicted declines by 5 percent to 25 percent, depending on the
area.
   But, the report concluded, ``actions by individual states would
have little effect'' on regional consequences. That crystal ball
has proved to be cloudy. With new technology, better management,
regulated pumping and normal rainfall, declines have been
considerably below generalized predictions.
   Suppose they weren't. It should be remembered that the original
sodbusters of the High Plains got by on dryland farming. About
three-quarters of the farmers in northwestern Kansas do not
irrigate. About half of the acreage of the Texas panhandle and
south is dry farmed. For years farmers have grown summer fallow
wheat, planting fields in alternate years.
   ``Eventually we'll have a mix of dryland and irrigated
farming,'' says former Nebraska state hydrologist Vince Dreeszen.
``This will keep the Ogallala around. Absolutely.''
   Even assuming a worst scenario, any changes in population and
agriculture ``are going to take place over time,'' says Michael
Jess, Nebraska director of water resources. This is evident across
the High Plains where abandoned, swaybacked, weed-covered
farmsteads of those who didn't make it gaze windowless over
still-green fields of neighbors who did.
   The 1982 study, the most thorough the Ogallala has had, did not
write the aquifer's epitaph in the dust. It will last ``well into
the next century,'' the report said. Nebraskans talk about a
400-year supply for them.
   Seen through the eyes of a Wes Robbins or a Wayne Wyatt or a
Bill Lyle, the Ogallala has been comprehended in time to save it.
Should this be so, and the drinking spree of the ancient aquifer
has taken the pledge, it would signal a commendable triumph of good
sense over greed.
   At a water conference in Lincoln not long ago, David Sands of
the Nebraska Audubon Society delivered a better epitaph for the
Ogallala:
   ``We don't own our world. We merely borrow it for our children.''

   Home on the range, the skies are not
cloudy all day. That's the problem.
   Rain falls and rivers flow far more kindly elsewhere than in the
High Plains.
   But this semi-arid swath from South Dakota to New Mexico has
been an irrigated breadbasket producing some 25 percent of the
nation's food and fiber since its huge underground sea, the
Ogallala Aquifer, began being pumped in earnest 70 years ago.
   But what if the well should eventually run dry?
   There have been some earth-shaking proposals that challenge
Genesis itself, such as pouring Canada's huge northern rivers south
of the border. Meanwhile, rainmaking, once the province of tom-toms
and flim-flam artists, has actually been working.
   Ten years ago in Texas, where wells have ``dewatered'' as
hydrologists delicately put it, they were talking about importing
water from Nebraska's mother lode of two-thirds of the aquifer's
Great Lakes-size supply.
   The cost and realities of interstate politics have stilled such
musings.
   In the 1960s, Texas was seriously considering capturing the
Mississippi River below New Orleans and siphoning and pumping it
800 miles to the Panhandle to irrigate its huge cotton fields.
Power to do it would have come from six or so new nuclear
generating plants. The prohibitive price kept Ol' Man River where
it was.
   In 1982 the ``Six-State High Plains Aquifer Regional Resources
Study'' for the U.S. Department of Commerce went into megariver
transfers in some detail. As outlined by the Army Corps of
Engineers, various alternatives would divert water from the
Missouri River, turn rivers backward, put reservoirs and pumping
stations all over the map and cost anywhere from $13 billion to
$22.6 billion in 1982 dollars.
   Stating it nicely, the Corps reported: ``NONE (their emphasis)
of that water has been identified as surplus to the needs of the
basin of origin.'' Michael Jess, Nebraska's director of water
resources, puts it more bluntly: ``We wouldn't stand for it.''
   Canada has expressed similar reluctance about a proposal by an
American engineering firm in California to redirect the Yukon,
Susitana and Tanana rivers from the Northwest Territories down to
the States. The flow would be 125 percent that of the Mississippi
at St. Louis. Cost: $200 billion in 1977 money.
   Another plan would cost $40 billion to tap the Mackenzie River,
which pours 325 million acre feet largely unused into the Arctic
Ocean every year, for 40 million acre feet delivered to the United
States by way of the Rockies.
   The Corps estimates its plans would cost the farmer $226 to $434
an acre foot _ which would bankrupt most of them overnight.
   ``Maybe some day if we have starving multitudes and people are
willing to work for a hell of a lot less than the minimum wage,
we'll have transfers,'' says Wes Robbins, a U.S. water expert in
Burlington, Colo.
   On a more realistic level is the 1982 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court that ground water is a commodity of interstate
commerce and its export cannot be embargoed by the state where it
is found. The cast involved a Colorado farmer, Joy Sporhase, who
owned land in Nebraska and was pumping its well water onto his
adjacent farm in Colorado. Nebraska tried to invoke its regulatory
powers against Sporhase, but the court said it couldn't.
   This caused Nebraska state Sen. Loran Schmit to suggest that
Nebraska begin selling its water out of state, since under Sporhase
there wasn't anything stopping the city of Denver, say, from buying
up Nebraska land and pumping its water back to the Mile High City.
   ``Schmit was damn near lynched,'' says Jess. ``We might as well
get something for our water while we have it.''
   Several small towns in Kansas and Colorado have dipped straws
into Nebraska for domestic water, and dewatered Texans and
Jayhawkers have been buying farms in liquid Cornhusker land, but
the implications of Sporhase remain, so far, only a cloud on the
horizon.
   In Kansas Water District No. 1, scientists have been
experimenting with cloud seeding to produce rain since 1975.
   ``People thought it was hocus-pocus, but if it could take some
of the stress off our aquifer, we thought it might be worth
trying,'' says district manager Keith Lebbin.
   The results have been evaluated independently in 1978, '81 and
'88. All confirmed a 9 percent increase over normal rainfall and,
more importantly, a 35 percent reduction in hail. The rainfall is
equivalent to an inch or inch and a half of precipitation. Hail
insurance rates have dropped 11 percent, a saving of $75 million.
   Hail the size of grapefruit can ruin a crop in minutes. It
caused Ed Gutentag, a federal geologist, to re-roof his house four
times in the 15 years he lived in the area.
   ``Some people think it's the Lord's work and we shouldn't
interfere,'' says Lebbin, who has four cloud-seeding planes on
ready alert during growing season. ``But we're not pretending to
make rain. We're just trying to maximize what the cloud is doing.''
   North Dakota has had even better luck. Ray Pat Jones,
meteorologist for the Upper Colorado River Municipal Water District
in Texas, says seeding has increased rainfall there 20 percent. The
Lubbock, Texas, water district is going to give it a try in three
to five years.
   ``It takes people that long to get comfortable with it,'' says
water manager Wayne Wyatt.

   In September, more than three quarters of a
century after construction began, the final stone will be put in
place at the Washington National Cathedral. It was first conceived
by the architect who designed the nation's capital, but only a few
years ago some thought the cathedral would never be finished.
Here's a look at the magnificent church and its history.

<TEXT>
   On the gray February day in 1924 when Woodrow
Wilson was laid to rest at the Washington National Cathedral, the
main sanctuary of the vast building was unfinished and open to the
sky.
   When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. mounted the cathedral's
Canterbury Pulpit on Palm Sunday 1968, just three days before his
death, the central tower was complete but the twin towers on the
west portal had not yet begun to rise.
   When mourners were summoned for a memorial service for
assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, the Protestant
Episcopal Cathedral Foundation had fallen $10.7 million in debt and
work at the cathedral was at a standstill.
   ``Only the most optimistic person would have bet on Washington
Cathedral ever being finished,'' said Canon Richard T. Feller,
clerk of the works since 1953. ``A review of the hard facts gave it
almost zero chance.''
   And yet at noon on Sept. 29, a gleaming blue crane will lift a
1,008-pound chunk of Indiana limestone, carved in the shape of a
folded leaf, onto the south tower's southwestern pinnacle and one
of the world's last great Gothic cathedrals will be completed.
   President Bush is expected to be on hand, just as President
Theodore Roosevelt was there for the foundation stone ceremony on
the same date in 1907. ``Godspeed in the work begun this noon,''
Roosevelt told a crowd estimated at 10,000 as a stone quarried in
Bethlehem was sunk in the rocky soil of Washington's Mount St.
Alban.
   A national worshiping place was first conceived by Pierre
L'Enfant, the Parisian-born American architect commissioned by
George Washington to plan the national capital. His blueprints for
the city included a church ``intended for national purposes, such
as public prayer, thanksgiving, funeral orations, etc., and
assigned to the special use of no particular Sect or denomination,
but equally open to all.''
   Partly because of concern over the constitutional separation of
church and state, it was not until Dec. 9, 1891, that the first
meeting to plan the cathedral was held at the home of banker
Charles C. Glover.
   Construction would not begin until 16 years later.
   Building the cathedral has cost $65 million to date, not taking
inflation into account. The figure includes more than 200
stained-glass windows and a wealth of statuary, mosaics and other
art works.
   According to the Federal Highway Administration, it can cost up
to $63 million in 1990 money to build a one-mile stretch of urban
interstate highway. The cost of a B-2 stealth bomber has been set
at from $530 million to $815 million, depending on how many are
purchased.
   Even in today's dollars, the cost of the cathedral is small
compared to such sums.
   Yet some have questioned whether the foundation, which operates
the cathedral under a charter granted by Congress in 1893, should
have pumped money into such a project in a capital facing mounting
homelessness and poverty.
   The provost of the cathedral, the Very Rev. Howard A. Perry,
says the decision in 1983 to finish the building on a pay-as-you-go
basis while retiring its debt was coupled with a commitment to
expand outreach to the city.
   At the time, 20 percent of the cathedral's budget went into
worship and outreach. It is now 40 percent.
   ``We don't see ourselves being so caught up in this building and
all its glory that we don't also have a very strong involvement in
the metropolitan area,'' says the Rev. Kwasi Thornell, who came
from a mission church in a poor St. Louis neighborhood to be canon
missioner of the cathedral.
   The cathedral does not double as a parish church, as do most
Episcopal cathedrals in the United States, so there is no built-in
congregation. Yet several services are held every day. There are
usually five services on Sunday.
   Perry says only about 15 percent to 20 percent of the people
attending the services come to the cathedral regularly.
   One of the regulars is Ruth Goodchild, daughter of an Episcopal
clergyman and wife of a retired Foreign Service officer. She and
her husband come in every Sunday from suburban McLean, Va. But her
involvement with the cathedral doesn't end there.
   On Monday afternoons, from 12:30 to 3, Mrs. Goodchild, a former
schoolteacher, goes to a school in a poverty-stricken area of
Washington and tutors two Hispanic fifth-graders.

   As chairman of the cathedral's literacy program, Mrs. Goodchild
also arranges and attends three-hour training sessions for
volunteers the first Saturday of each month.
   There are more than 90 volunteers in the program, some visiting
schools once or twice a week and some working in the evening with
adults at a former public school now run by the city government as
a tutoring center.
   The cathedral is built in the style of the English cathedrals of
the 14th century, with some variations, including mostly
French-style windows. It is put together in the same stone-on-stone
method used by medieval masons.
   Although there are steel reinforcing rods in the concrete floors
and in the cores of the pillars, there is no structural steel in
the bearing walls. Flying buttresses, countering the outward thrust
of the Gothic arches, hold them up.
   ``This thing is built to stay here a couple of thousand years,''
says Joseph Alonso, the mason foreman.
   At 83,012 square feet, the Washington cathedral is the sixth
largest in the world, exceeded by St. Peter's in Rome at 227,069,
Seville at 128,570, the unfinished Cathedral of St. John the Divine
in New York at 121,000, Liverpool at 101,000 and Milan at 92,600.
The building is 518 feet long. Its central tower rises 301 feet and
the west tower reaches 234 feet.
   The work proceeded from east to west, starting in 1907 with the
Bethlehem chapel, where Wilson was laid to rest, then continuing to
the Chapel of St. Joseph of Arimathea, with a mural of Christ's
entombment, and the Resurrection Chapel, with the cathedral's only
mosaics. A visitors' center and museum shop complete the crypt, or
lower level.
   The main altar, directly above Bethlehem Chapel, was built next.
Then came the choir, with its richly carved wood, and the south and
north transepts, which intersect the nave at right angles to form
the shape of a cross.
   Construction stopped in 1977 due to the shortage of money. Work
resumed in 1980 after a new bishop and dean, the Right Rev. John
Thomas Walker, started a fund-raising drive and ordered stringent
economies _ cutting back on heat, reducing staff and turning the
lights off except during services. The final phase of construction
began on April 5, 1983, with the setting of the first stone for the
west towers.
   Walker died after heart surgery on Sept. 30, 1989, the day that
a ceremony was held marking the beginning of the final year of
construction. Like five other bishops who served as the building
rose, he is interred in the cathedral. His successor, the Right
Rev. Ronald H. Haines, will be installed a few weeks after the
cathedral's ceremonious completion.
   A few months before his death, Walker challenged the cathedral
to become ``a servant church.''
   ``The alternative is to become an anachronism, a museum piece, a
stop on a tour of the capital city,'' he wrote. ``I don't believe
that we will be reduced to be a museum piece.''
   The building will need more work even after the final stone is
set.
   ``We've got a 70-year-old building at one end and a brand-new
building at the other end, and the 70-year-old portion of the
building and the intermediate areas have got to have some
preservation,'' Feller says.
   One problem is that during the stop-and-start construction, the
building was often protected only by temporary roofs.
   Walking a visitor through the nave, Alonso said: ``You notice
these black stains here. That's from water infiltrating. It seeps
into the limestone and then darkens.''
   ``A building like this is always moving, expanding, settling,''
he added.
   Unlike New York's St. John the Divine, which is on the edge of
Harlem, the Washington cathedral is on a leafy hilltop in a
fashionable residential area far from the troubled inner city.
   From the south tower, you can see across the Potomac River to
the Pentagon, off into Maryland to the Mormon Temple and beyond to
Sugar Loaf Mountain, up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol and the
Library of Congress. The White House, four miles away, is hidden
behind trees.
   ``You can be any place in that building and you can find
delight,'' says James P. Cramer, executive vice president of the
American Institute of Architects.

   From Coventry to Philadelphia, from the edge
of Harlem to the Golden Gate, cathedral building in the 20th
century has often been accompanied by controversy.
   A cathedral serves as the official seat, or chair, of the bishop
of a diocese in churches that are governed by bishops, such as the
Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican or Episcopal and, in
Sweden, the Lutheran denominations.
   The question of whether and how to build cathedrals has been
revived with the scheduled completion in September of the
Gothic-style Washington National Cathedral, begun in 1907. The
question is not a new one.
   When the 14th century St. Michael's Cathedral in Coventry,
England, was gutted by German bombing during World War II, the
cathedral chapter decided to rebuild in a controversial modern
style.
   ``I think they were right,'' said Stanford Lehmberg, a historian
of cathedrals who teaches at the University of Minnesota, arguing
that England already has a wealth of real medieval churches, and
doesn't need to build copies. ``Here, where we don't genuinely have
any medieval buildings, I think it is appropriate for us to have
one.''
   San Francisco Roman Catholics, however, built a modern cathedral
after their 75-year-old red brick Gothic one was destroyed by fire
in 1962.
   ``The community at large ... expected the new cathedral to be a
building of the future, not a clever replica of a traditional
style,'' Monsignor James P. Gaffey said in a lecture in 1983.
   Some didn't want it to be built at all.
   Twenty-seven priests wrote to Archbishop Joseph T. McGucken in
1967 that human inequities ``must take precedence over parish and
diocesan building programs.''
   The archbishop argued there was no contradiction between
building a cathedral and helping the poor. The new St. Mary's
Cathedral was dedicated in 1971.
   In 1967, Episcopal Bishop Horace W. Donegan of New York halted
fund-raising to complete the Cathedral Church of St. John the
Divine, begun in 1892. He said the structure, located on the border
of Harlem, would remain unfinished as a witness to the ``despair
and anguish'' of the nearby slums.
   This decision was reversed by Bishop Paul Moore in the 1970s.
Work has resumed and a fund-raising drive is under way aimed at
completing the cathedral early in the 21st century. The diocese has
launched a program to train young people from Harlem and the South
Bronx in stone cutting and stone carving.
   Although it is a myth that cathedrals are never finished, there
are a number that have been unfinished for some time.
   In Philadelphia, Episcopalians broke ground in the 1920s for
what was planned as the largest Gothic cathedral in the world. Then
the Depression came along and there was ``a series of bishops who
were concerned about the edifice complex,'' said the Rev. Tom
McClellan, rector of St. Mary's at the Cathedral, the parish church
on the site.
   All that was completed was the apse, the front part of the
church that includes the altar. It is now part of St. Mary's. The
diocese decided in 1975 to leave the cathedral unfinished and use
the 100-acre plot as a life care community for retired people.
   In Seattle, ground was broken in 1930 for St. Mark's Episcopal
Cathedral. There, too, the Depression intervened. The building has
a wooden roof that was intended to be temporary, and there has been
rain damage in the sanctuary. The exterior walls are a rough
surface that was intended to be faced.
   Lisette Trombley, publications coordinator for the cathedral,
said a pledge campaign has been started to get the building
finished, starting with the roof.

   Washington National Cathedral is only one of
several names by which the building on Washington's Mount St. Alban
has been known.
   Officially, it is the Cathedral Church of St. Peter and St.
Paul, the name chosen by the cathedral chapter after the Episcopal
Diocese of Washington was carved out of the Maryland diocese in the
1890s.
   As the building slowly rose, and became the site of national
observances, people took to calling it National Cathedral.
   The late Bishop William Creighton, who took office in 1969, is
said to have thought this presumptuous, so the name used on
cathedral stationery and publicity was ``Washington Cathedral.''
   One of the three schools on the 57-acre cathedral grounds is
called the National Cathedral School for Girls.
   A few months before his death in 1989, Bishop John Thomas Walker
approved the use of the name ``Washington National Cathedral.''
   The Rev. Canon John Frizell objected to the change in a guest
editorial in the diocesan newspaper, saying, ``It does not do honor
to other faith communities in this pluralistic country when we
arrogate to ourselves a title which is illusory, misleading and
potentially divisive.''
   The Rev. Canon Leonard Freeman, director of communications for
the cathedral, however, described the new name as a compromise.
   National Cathedral ``has long been kind of the other name of the
place,'' Freeman said, noting that the Washington Metro System uses
it on bus schedules. He said he always called the building National
Cathedral himself before he came to Washington.
   By any name, the cathedral receives no financial support from
the U.S. government or the national Episcopal Church. It is the
official seat of the presiding bishop of the church, but his office
is in New York.
   Over the years many Washington churches have come to call
themselves national. There are National Presbyterian Church,
National City Christian Church, National Baptist Memorial Church
and the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, among others.

   From the start, there was debate over whether
Washington National Cathedral should be built in the medieval
Gothic style.
   In the 1890s, as the cathedral was being planned, a committee
voted 12 to 3 to approve a domed, Renaissance-style design of white
marble with a long colonnade, submitted by noted American architect
Ernest Flagg. Others favored the Greek Revival style of many of the
capital's government buildings.
   The cathedral chapter, or board of trustees, voted unanimously
on May 21, 1906, to build a Gothic cathedral instead.
   ``This is probably the last one,'' says Stanford Lehmberg,
professor of history at the University of Minnesota and an
authority on English cathedrals.
   Some have questioned the appropriateness of using a 14th century
style for a cathedral that will be serving 21st century worshipers.
   ``It's Christianity, as it were, in a period costume,'' says
David L. Holmes Jr., professor of religion at the College of
William and Mary. ``You have to ask what an unbeliever thinks. He
or she may be awed, or may relegate the Christian message to an
irrelevant position because the building is so anachronistic and
almost Disneyland in character.''
   ``I don't think that it will ever happen again,'' says E.A.
Sovik, a leading church architect who works in the more modern
style of the liturgical movement. ``I think that it was a valiant
gesture, but it was started during a period when architecture and
architects were looking back and not forward.
   ``I think the whole Gothic revival was a mistake. But within
that mistake, things were done well and done badly, and this one
was done well.''

   Here are some milestones in the history of
Washington National Cathedral:
   _ Construction, which began in 1907, was halted during the two
world wars.
   _ Work on the choir began in 1921, the year the Lincoln Memorial
was completed.
   _ The chancel was opened for public worship on Easter Sunday in
1932.
   _ The Wilson Bay, to which the President Woodrow Wilson's
remains were moved from Bethlehem Chapel, was dedicated in 1956.
   _ Beginning in March 1979, prayers for the American hostages in
Iran were said in the cathedral daily for the 444 days of their
incarceration.
   _ For three days in November 1982, when the Vietnam memorial was
dedicated, the 57,939 names listed on it were read in the War
Memorial Chapel during the day and in Bethlehem Chapel at night.

   When it comes to writing screenplays, two cooks

have been the result of collaboration between two or more writers.
And in today's electronic age, sometimes the collaborators rarely
see each other in person.

   Rarely has a long-distance relationship been so
blissful.
   Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr. haven't seen one another in more than
a year and have met just five times in the last 14 years. They live
2,000 miles apart.
   Yet they are one of this town's hottest screenwriting teams,
authors of the summer hit ``Dick Tracy'' and the 1986 blockbuster
``Top Gun,'' as well as ``Legal Eagles'' and ``The Secret of My
Success.''
   In an industry where collaboration often is considered a
necessary evil, a disruption of one's personal vision, Cash and
Epps and several other screenwriting partnerships are finding that
two cooks don't spoil the broth.
   Indeed, as in a good marriage, a writing team's sum frequently
exceeds its parts.
   Cash works in East Lansing, Mich., where he teaches in the film
program at Michigan State University. Epps writes in Culver City,
Calif., handling much of the team's Hollywood business. The former
is good at dialogue, while the latter specializes in story.
   The two bridge the Continental Divide with an electronic meeting
of the minds, linked by speakerphone and dual computer screens
flashing text simultaneously in two cities.
   ``It's words and music _ we're good at different things,'' Epps
says. ``And I happen to like the distance. It's kept us together.
It's taken ego out of the equation.''
   At a time when such actors as Bruce Willis and Arnold
Schwarzenegger command salaries well in excess of $5 million, the
entertainment industry suddenly has rediscovered the value of
scripts. In recent weeks, several screenplays have sold for $1
million and more in frantic bidding wars. Many of these deals were
prompted by team-written projects.
   Brian Helgeland and Manny Coto reportedly received $1 million
for their script ``Ticking Man.'' Doug Richardson and Rick Jaffa
collected the same amount for ``Hell Bent ... And Back.''
   ``The Ultimatum,'' written by Laurence Dworet and Robert Roy
Pool, brought them $1 million. Pen Densham and John Watson earned
$1.2 million for the script ``Prince of Thieves.''
   The ultimate test of a screenwriting team is not the price of a
single script. Rather, it's whether the team can remain together,
consistently creating stories that please film critics and studio
accountants.
   These writers _ known simply by the names Cash &amp; Epps, Gale &amp;
Zemeckis, Gideon &amp; Evans and Ganz &amp; Mandel _ can split $500,000 and
more per script. The money's good, and so's the symbiotic link that
makes the productivity pleasant.
   Writers feel that given the key role they play in filmmaking
they don't draw enough credit. When a picture flops, they take the
blame. When it's a smash, someone else collects the credit. What's
more, just about everybody from the electrician to the gaffer
believes he or she can make a scene better than the most
experienced writer.
   Since so much of the movie business hinges on compromise,
writers working in teams are prepared better for that give-and-take.
   ``It's a wonderful thing in life to be heard and understood, and
your partner is always there to hear and understand,'' says Lowell
Ganz. His nine-year association with Babaloo Mandel has yielded
scripts for ``Parenthood,'' the Academy Award-nominated ``Splash''
(co-written with Bruce Jay Friedman), ``Gung Ho'' and ``Night
Shift.''
   ``Babaloo could go to Mars and I'd wait for him to come back,''
Ganz says.
   Other teams joke that they have suicide pacts _ they can't face
a blank page of paper alone. Writer's block in a team is a rarity;
when one writer hits a wall, the other should be able to take the
lead.
   Rick Natkin and partner David Fuller wrote the scripts for last
year's HBO film ``The Heist'' and next spring's feature ``The
Taking of Beverly Hills,'' starring Ken Wahl.
   ``We entertain each other, which makes the lonely task of
writing so much easier,'' Natkin says. ``We always write faster
than an individual does.''
   A good writing team should spot a bomb even before the fuse is
lit. Dialogue is read aloud, plot points are debated and character
development is argued. Among the more successful teams, there's an
unbreakable rule: If one half of the team doesn't like what the
other half suggests, the idea goes to the Dumpster.

   ``Writing teams tend to write less personal pieces but highly
plotted pieces,'' says producer Lynda Obst, who co-wrote the new
Hollywood novel ``Dirty Dreams'' with Carol Wolper. ``Their scripts
have less internal logic, less of an internal voice. They're not
literary. But they have an external logic that works in this
business.''
   Obst, now making ``The Fisher King'' with , internal films are written
by people who
sit up late at night by themselves. Jim and I are pop writers,
writing for the masses.''
   Some writing teams say differences of opinion rarely spark
fights; others say a bloodletting occasionally brings new life to
the creative process. Billy Wilder's battles with Charles Brackett
were legendary and golden. The combative duo wrote Oscar-winning
scripts for 1945's ``The Lost Weekend'' and 1950's ``Sunset
Boulevard'' (written with D.M. Marshman Jr.), and the nominated
script for 1948's ``A Foreign Affair'' (written with Richard Breen).
   ``We've had a lot of screaming,'' says Bruce Evans, whose
12-year association with Raynold Gideon has given birth to
screenplays for ``Stand By Me,'' an Academy Award nominee,
``Starman,'' ``Made in Heaven,'' ``A Man, a Woman and a Bank'' and
the upcoming ``The Day Before Midnight.''
   ``It's very valuable having a partner disagree with you because
if one partner can convince the other he can probably convince the
audience, too. ... The end product outweighs the pain you have
getting it, like a good marriage,'' Evans says.
   With most writing teams, the screenwriting credit is shared
evenly, and some alternate the order in which their names appear.
The work, however, sometimes is not split justly.
   Michael Beckner and Jim Gorman's script for ``Texas Lead and
Gold'' recently sold in a deal valued at $1 million. Beckner is
considered the writer of the team and Gorman the producing partner,
writing little of the script.
   Novelist Roger Simon and director-writer Paul Mazursky are
listed as the writers for both ``Enemies: A Love Story'' and
``Scenes From a Mall,'' a December release directed by Mazursky.
Starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler, ``Scenes From a Mall'' is
the first film Allen has acted in but not directed since 1976's
``The Front.''
   When Mazursky works with a partner, be it Simon or Leonidas
Capetanos, he confers with his colleague, outlining the story.
Mazursky's partner then writes a first draft. Mazursky makes
revisions to that draft, and the process begins again with both
writers sharing the keyboard.
   ``It's sort of like tag-team wrestling,'' says Simon. ``I'm
slightly more cerebral and he's slightly more theatrical.''
   Although Cash and Epps work best many miles apart, most writing
teams find proximity improves the product.
   Ganz and Mandel, for instance, who just finished a script for
Billy Crystal titled ``City Slickers,'' sit across from each other
in a small office. Before they begin writing their scripts in
longhand, they outline the story on a series of index cards. The
day's work is typed up overnight, which is reviewed the next
morning and revised.
   ``When we read what we've just written, sometimes we weep,
sometimes we say, `We're out of the business,''' Ganz said.
``Sometimes we dance together in the room.''

   It was where millions of people were introduced
to America, a cavernous building on Ellis Island in New York
Harbor, perhaps the largest building many of them had ever seen.
Out of use and neglected for nearly 30 years, it has undergone a
$156 million refurbishing and will reopen in September as the
National Museum of Immigration.

   The noble, soaring spaces are radiantly clean
and dry again. Light streams in on a summer day. On one or two
patches of wall restorers have left poignant graffiti, scribbled
names and drawings of outstretched hands.
   The graffiti was the artwork of immigrants, some of the 12
million people seeking a new life who passed through this main
building of the Ellis Island immigration station. They were the
forebears of perhaps 140 million present-day Americans.
   ``Nowhere else can you say `almost half the population of the
country can trace their ancestry back through this building,'''
says architect John Belle, director of a $156 million Ellis Island
restoration project.
   The architects in charge of the renovations were Belle's firm,
Beyer Blinder Belle, and Notter Finegold &amp; Alexander. They began
work in 1983 to rescue the 220,000-square-foot building, neglected
for more than a quarter of a century and left in a state of
near-ruin. It will reopen to the public on Sept. 10 as the National
Museum of Immigration and is expected to draw 2{ million visitors a
year.
   ``We began by getting to know everything about the building, by
documenting it to the umpteenth degree, every nook and cranny,''
says Belle, leading a tour of the beaux-arts structure.
   The familiar, warmly handsome, horizontal building in limestone
and brick, with four copper-domed towers, dominates its island in
the harbor alongside Liberty Island.
   The present building opened in 1900, replacing an earlier wooden
structure destroyed by fire in 1897, along with all the records.
The present building continued in use until 1954, when it was
inherited, already in deteriorated condition, by the National Park
Service.
   ``The original design of the building with its east and west
wings was a very classical plan, and it was also a very efficient
plan for moving people through,'' Belle says. ``Now, starting in
September we're going to have numbers of people moving through
again.''
   In addition to describing the history and experiences of those
Ellis Island immigrants, the museum will reflect the whole history
of immigration into this country from all entry points. It also
will present some of the achievements of those immigrants.
   Visitors will be able to follow the immigrants' route through
the building. From the dock where the ferry from Manhattan will
leave them _ as the steamship-company ferries used to leave their
ancestors _ they'll walk to the main entrance under an airy new
canopy, described by Belle as ``a contemporary interpretation of
the original.''
   Belle, a native of Wales who came to this country in 1959,
specializes in historic preservation. In addition to the Ellis
Island project, he directed the restoration of New York City's
Grand Central Terminal and the South Street Seaport Museum, the
Boston Customs House and the Delaware Aqueduct.
   ``The Park Service is very strict about never faking history,''
Belle says. ``That's a philosophy we share. We don't want to fool
anybody with our project. This is a very, very careful restoration.
   ``When we came in the plaster was on the floor. All that has
gone back in place. Where elements no longer existed we tried to
design the modern equivalents. History will be the judge _ you will
be the judge.
   ``This is an attempt to interpret the building, sometimes with
elements that are not compatible in the design sense, but that try
to tell the story.''
   Most immigrants spent most of their time on Ellis Island in the
second floor registry room. In its heyday it routinely handled
5,000 to 7,000 people a day. April 17, 1907, is believed to have
been the peak day, when 11,747 came through.
   ``To many it must have seemed huge, and intimidating, the
largest building they'd ever seen in their lives, filled with
noise, a babel of languages,'' Belle says.
   And the lamps glittering along the balconies and shining down
from the chandeliers would have been the first time many of them,
coming from small villages and simple ways of life, ever saw
electric light.
   At the far end of the great chamber is a memorable staircase:
the one by which immigrants left after negotiating the nervous
passage through desks and register books and questioning officers.
The exit was to one of three destinations, down one of the three
lanes separated by the staircase's two rails.
   On the left, you were off to catch a ferry into Manhattan; on
the right, to buy your ticket for a train heading out West. But the
center lane was the ``stair of separation'' down which immigrants
were detoured for further formalities, entry to the promised land
heartsinkingly postponed.
   They may have found themselves pleading their cases in the
special inquiry room, a kind of court of last appeal. This is one
of the few rooms that will be left as a ``period room,'' with its
carved wooden railings directing anxious steps toward the judge's
table.
   Many other interiors have been designed to accommodate exhibits,
not to simulate the rooms' early appearance.
   In addition to the major exhibition areas, there are a library
and reading room, an oral history center with a recording studio
where immigrants and former employees may chronicle their memories,
and a listening center where others may hear these recordings.
   Other public amenities include orientation areas, museum shops,
two 146-seat movie theaters, meeting rooms and a restaurant with a
terrace overlooking the harbor. A curatorial complex contains
offices, research facilities and conservation labs.

   It pains lawyer-novelist Scott F. Turow that
some big city critics have dismissed his work as unimportant. It
hurts a lot, until he looks at his bank balance. The author of
``Presumed Innocent'' has learned to spin best sellers from his
experiences as both a prosecutor and a defense attorney.

<TEXT>
   As a prosecutor who turned defense attorney,
novelist Scott F. Turow knows how to mine the shadowy regions of
the legal profession.
   In Turow's fiction, prosecutors are violated. And when the
defense rests, it may be in the bed of the client's mistress. In
Turow's real life, judges have been jailed and yesterday's
prosecutorial target may be today's client.
   At age 41, Turow, now a partner in a major Chicago law firm, is
two-for-two on the fiction best-seller lists, reaping considerable
national publicity and fat paychecks.
   ``All I can say is they won't be holding any tag days for Scott
Turow,'' he said in a telephone interview while on tour promoting
his second published novel, ``Burden of Proof.''
   In 1986, Turow stepped down after eight years as an assistant
U.S. attorney in Chicago. He got a record $200,000 advance for his
first published novel, ``Presumed Innocent,'' and watched it climb
to the top of the hardbound best-seller lists. That was followed by
4.3 million paperback sales and a $1 million movie rights deal.
   The $20 million movie, starring Harrison Ford and directed by
Alan Pakula, recently opened.
   The publicity surrounding ``Presumed Innocent'' made much of the
fact that a high-profile prosecutor had written a thriller about a
prosecutor being tried for murder. It was not noted widely that
Turow's only job since graduating from Harvard Law School had been
with the U.S. attorney's office, which does not handle murder cases.
   Perhaps coincidentally, the prosecutor-as-defendant theme had
appeared in one of Turow's own real-life cases _ that of
then-Illinois Attorney Gen. William J. Scott. Turow was one of the
federal attorneys who obtained a tax fraud conviction against the
state's chief prosecutor in 1980.
   ``I realize now _ and I think my wife, Annette, understood
before I did _ that writing about the prosecution of a prosecutor
was part of my preparation to do defense work,'' Turow said.
   Defense attorney Phillip Kurland argued in his unsuccessful
appeal of Scott's conviction that Turow and his federal colleagues
had turned the trial into a ``Roman circus.''
   The phrase found a possibly subconscious echo in ``Presumed
Innocent,'' when hero Rusty Sabich likens his murder trial to
``Christians and lions back in Rome.''
   Before leaving his federal post, Turow also saw more legal
ambiguities through his involvement in Operation Greylord, the
federal probe that sent many Cook County Circuit Court judges to
prison.
   The turn to defense work, which coincided with the publication
of ``Presumed Innocent,'' brought Turow to Sonnenschein Nath &amp;
Rosenthal, a 300-attorney firm with offices in six cities.
   ``I suppose you could say I'm a specialist in white-collar
criminal defense, mostly in the grand jury phase,'' he said. ``None
of my clients are currently under indictment, although several are
under investigation.''
   ``I've walked both sides of the street now, and I really can see
the system from both sides.''
   Turow once got a slap on the wrist from the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   In 1987, a Miami cocaine trafficking defendant named Ronald
Ofshe sought to have his indictment dismissed because his defense
attorney, Marvin Glass, was serving as a federal drug informant.
   Glass himself was a defendant in the Chicago Greylord probe and
was negotiating with Turow for leniency. With Turow's permission,
Glass had secretly tape-recorded at least one of his conversations
with Ofshe.
   Although the appellate court refused to dismiss Ofshe's
indictment, it appended a footnote calling Turow's agreement with
Glass ``reprehensible'' and recommending that Turow be investigated
by attorney registration officials in Chicago.
   Turow's former superiors in the U.S. Justice Department later
exonerated him, but the appeals court refused to strike the
footnote from the record.
   Turow was asked if the incident may have been reflected in
``Burden of Proof,'' in which the lawyer-hero burglarizes his own
client's house and also has a romantic scene in a hot tub with his
prosecutorial adversary.
   ``There's no doubt that that contributed to my analysis of the
attorney-client relationship,'' Turow said. ``Everything, after
all, becomes fodder for the fictional mill. In retrospect, I'm just
glad I could find something useful in something that was very
painful and, I still feel, very unneccessary.''
   Some critics have objected to the frequent sex scenes in
``Burden of Proof'' as unconvincing, but the author says that only
the ultimately platonic hot-tub tryst caused him problems.
   ``I really had to work up my nerve to write it and submit it,''
he said.
   ``Presumed Innocent'' had its steamy scenes, too, but the
critics found them more acceptable in what was, at heart, a
traditional and gritty murder mystery.
   ``One of the exalted things about the mystery novel is its
architecture,'' says Turow, who taught creative writing at Stanford
University before going to law school.
   While at Stanford, Turow says he made ``three serious attempts''
to get a novel published and once cranked out a novel in three
weeks to win a bet.
   ``I'm not sure I really won,'' he says in retrospect.
   Turow's first published book was ``One L,'' a non-fiction
account of his first year at Harvard Law School, written on
contract, but he says his early unpublished works may have helped
him escape the ``second novel jinx.''
   ``Maybe my good fortune with my second novel was that it ain't
my second novel,'' he says.
   Reviews of ``Burden of Proof,'' although less enthusiastic than
those for ``Presumed Innocent,'' tended to be favorable _ with
several critics suggesting it was a more serious work than its
predecessor.
   ``Of course the bad ones hurt,'' Turow said of the reviews.
``But they've been running about 8- or 9-to-1 favorably. I
sometimes wonder if some of the negative reviewers aren't out to
get me, but there's always that old lawyers' adage: `Reasonable
minds can differ.'''
   And then again, no tag days.

   When Kevin Conway, the star of ``Other People's Money,'' left
the play, Gallin replaced him with Stephen Keats, an experienced
stage actor but not known to most theatergoers.
   ``We are kind of at the point in our run where we are a bit
ambivalent,'' Gallin says of the play, which has been running in
New York since February 1989. ``We don't think we need a name yet,
but it would be nice to eventually have one.''
   And most television actors welcome the prestige of appearing on
Broadway.
   ``I can't let opportunities like this go by,'' Busfield says.
``I've been in the movie `Field of Dreams.' I've been in a hit
television series. I needed a play. I needed to establish to myself
and to the people in this business that I can be a lead in a play,
and the play won't fall apart and close in one night.''
   Perlman wasn't pursuing theater roles when he was offered the
job in ``A Few Good Men'' to replace Stephen Lang and quickly took
it.
   ``I use the same criteria for wanting to do this job as I use
for any job,'' Perlman says. ``Is the role challenging? Is it
allowing me to explore parts of humanity I haven't had the chance
to tap into? Is it a role I can have respect and enthusiasm for?''
   Television stars coming to the New York theater are nothing new.
Lucille Ball tried it in 1960 with the musical ``Wildcat.'' It ran
only six months, closing when Ball became ill and left the show.
   Mary Tyler Moore has played Broadway several times with varying
degrees of success. Her first attempt, right after ``The Dick Van
Dyke Show'' in 1963, was ``Breakfast at Tiffany's,'' a huge flop
that closed in previews and never officially opened. Her co-star
was Richard Chamberlain of ``Dr. Kildare'' fame. She had more luck
replacing Tom Conti in ``Whose Life is It Anyway?'', in which the
playwright changed the leading character from a man to a woman to
accommodate the actress.
   Despite the powerful presence of Tyne Daly in ``Gypsy,'' its
producer, Barry Weissler, discounts the attraction of television
names to theater audiences. Movie stars like Kathleen Turner and
Dustin Hoffman sell tickets, he says.
   ``TV stars do not sell tickets because the people who made them
television stars don't go to the theater,'' he says. ``They watch
television.
   ``With `Gypsy,' we were up and down on the road before coming to
New York,'' Weissler said. ``It was an enormous risk, but we had
two things going for us. We had a brilliant show, and a woman
playing Rose who had the talent. Had she not been able to come up
to the role, we would have been dead in the water. Because she
surprised everyone, it helped us. That had nothing to do with star
power. That had to do with people telling their friends, `You've
got to see this.'''
   Still, Weissler cast Lavin as Daly's replacement.
   ``Linda is a very well-known Broadway stage actress,'' he says.
``So she's going to draw the theater public. But she also hit it
big with `Alice.' So maybe tourists, coming in during the summer,
might choose to see `Gypsy' because they remember the show. I might
have a double punch going for me.''
   Producer James Walsh toured ``I'm Not Rappaport,'' the comedy by
Herb Gardner, with its original stars, Judd Hirsh, late of
``Taxi,'' and Cleavon Little, star of the Mel Brooks movie comedy
``Blazing Saddles.''
   ``It probably was the most successful tour of a play anyone has
done in the last decade,'' he said. ``We broke house records.
   ``Sometimes you can send a very good play out and because you
want to satisfy the need for a star, you end up doing half the
production you should be doing.''
   When Walsh sends his current Broadway hit ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' out on the road this fall, the star in Los Angeles and
possibly other cities will be Amy Irving, an actress with theater
and movie credits but without proven box-office appeal.
   ``I don't want to take someone from a television series, if they
can't act on stage,'' Walsh says. ``So I think it's a better break
for an audience, if you get somebody who is really good, who may or
may not have a high profile, but will serve the play. So if I don't
deliver them a big star, I can promise them a really good
production.''

Rage</HEAD>

   In the brief, ringing silence after the
tornado passed, Donna Ray realized 15-month-old Benjamin was gone.
   The 250 mph wind had torn the Rays' only son from his mother's
arms. Their trailer home had exploded. The family of six was
suddenly five.
   ``I was the one who had hold of Benny. I was supposed to have
held on to him and not let anything hurt him,'' Donna said.
``There's nothing worse than knowing you can't keep things from
hurting your kids, that you've got no control.''
   And no one to blame. ``It was nobody's fault,'' Donna's husband,
Tim, said flatly. It is the tragedy's randomness that is hardest to
take.
   ``I just want him back ... want to watch him grow up,'' Donna
said. ``We tried so long to have a little boy and then we get him,
and he's gone.''
   Said Geneva Speer, the baby's great-aunt: ``They had three girls
and wanted a boy so bad. They really couldn't afford to have all
them kids, but they kept having them until they got them a boy.''
   More than a month after Benjamin's death, the Rays still are
revisiting the moments before everything stopped making sense. They
retrace their steps but know there is no changing them.
   The June 2 storm, which killed eight people and injured 180, was
the worst to hit Indiana in 16 years. It spun through town in four
minutes, devouring the Rays' home at Riverview Trailer Park in
seconds.
   Tim, Donna and their three young daughters were scattered in
hospital emergency rooms, their lives uprooted like the grove of 20
poplar trees that used to shade the family's trailer on hot August
afternoons.
   The two-acre trailer park now resembles a haunted battleground
littered with the munitions of everyday life: Dad's ratchet, the
dog's rubber ball, Mom's ironing board and the children's
bright-colored toys.
   ``The thing that keeps us going are the three little girls. We
can still pick them up and hold them,'' said Tim, 31, a wiry man
with a freckled face. ``But my little boy ... I was not ready to
give him up.''
   The tornado struck without warning.
   ``We'd just come home from the store. I'd no more than got the
water on to boiling for dinner,'' said Donna, 27, who first saw the
green-tinted sky churning outside the kitchen window.
   ``They say tornados make a noise, but we didn't hear anything.
We were already in the middle of it,'' she said.
   Donna screamed for her husband. ``Get in back,'' Tim shouted.
The lights flickered, then went out.
   Each parent grabbed two children. Donna had her left arm wrapped
around Benny. With her right, she dragged 6-year-old Abby by her
blue-flowered summer dress. ``Get in back,'' Tim screamed again.
   Too late. The trailer's four walls blew out. Donna looked down.
The ground was swirling beneath her. Hold on to Benny, hold on, she
thought.
   Then Benny was gone. ``Oh my God,'' Donna cried and fell to the
ground. The tornado had passed.
   When Tim opened his eyes, he saw Benny lying face-down a few
feet from his unconscious mother. ``I picked him up and he was real
limp,'' Tim said. ``It was quiet. Like in a desert, there was just
silence all around.''
   Then came tears.
   Abby, Ginny, 7, and 3-year-old Melissa were half-buried by
debris, their pale skin gashed and wispy brown hair matted with
blood. Tim groped toward them, pulling himself out of the mud each
time his broken leg collapsed.
   Donna soon came around. But she still was in a daze.
   ``All I could think about was getting help,'' said Donna, whose
forehead was slashed and collarbone broken when the wind's current
dropped her.
   ``I wanted to get Benny in the car because it was raining and
cold. I was telling myself: `I'm going to get help. I'm going to
take him to the hospital.'''
   The Rays strapped the baby into his car seat. But they knew.
Benny was motionless, silent, showed no sign of breathing. His soft
skull had been crushed.
   ``I just didn't want to admit that it could be my baby that was
taken,'' said Donna, her expression more blank than bitter.
   The funeral was a blur. Sad embraces, prayers led by a
Pentecostal minister whom Tim met back when he first started
working at a local fast-food restaurant 10 years ago. It took only
two pallbearers to lift the blue metal casket into the hearse.
   Faith is the frequent counsel in this town of 14,000 people, 42
Christian churches and about 75 pastors.
   Friends and strangers tell the Rays that Benjamin is God's child
now. It's of little comfort.
   ``Some would say it's an act of God ... but try telling that to
the woman whose baby is jerked out of her arms,'' said the Rev. Max
Toliver, a Methodist minister whose neighboring trailer also was
destroyed in the storm.
   Tim and Donna, who don't attend church regularly, have
gratefully accepted prayers, Bibles, pamphlets and other gestures
meant to ease their despair. They know about counseling, the books
on loss and talk shows on pain.
   But nothing works. Nothing can restore Benny or the domestic
dream Tim and Donna nearly grasped before they were sucked into the
vortex.
   ``When we got married I set some goals. I wanted to have little
boys and I've always wanted to have a garden, fence off a place,
get the kids a pony, maybe build them a big old playhouse,'' Tim
said.
   That was eight years ago, when the couple set out to create the
kind of large and close-knit family they knew as kids growing up in
this rural area about 60 miles south of Indianapolis.
   The night the tornado hit, Tim and Donna were feeling good.
They'd made a dent in their debts and set aside part of the
$20,000-a-year salary Tim earns managing a local Hardee's
restaurant. They were planning to buy a piece of land somewhere in
the rolling, green country near here.
   Now they are living in a rental house stocked and paid for with
thousands of dollars from strangers, family and friends, like Tim's
co-workers at Hardee's restaurants.
   ``This community is a family,'' said Donna. ``I don't know how
we're ever going to thank them, and that bothers us.''

   Accepting the spontaneous charity has been painful for the Rays,
who have always done for themselves. They are the kind of people
who fix their own cars or sew their own clothes as much out of
pride as practicality.
   They also took pride in their baby pictures and birth
certificates, the girls' favorite dolls, Tim's comic book
collection, Donna's half-sewn dress, even the red polka-dot cutouts
for learning ABCs _ all of which the tornado spewed over miles of
wooded and rain-soaked land.
   ``You can tell they loved their kids a lot. Just look at all
these toys,'' said the Rev. Johnny Johnson of Dive Christian Church.
   He was among a band of family, neighbors and preachers who in
the hot days following the storm showed up to save for the Rays
what muddied belongings they could. They burned the rest.
   ``When I first saw this, I went home and cried,'' said Beth
Cooper, a mother of two who showed up to help a couple she'd never
met. ``I suddenly knew how close we are to dust.''
   Now, in the wreckage of their lives, the Rays see the normalcy
they once had, the sense of control they are struggling to regain.
They are looking now for some small order amid the chaos.
   Donna wants a new blue mailbox with a red flag, like the one she
used to visit each day for bills and the occasional card. When
Cuddles, one of two family dogs, turned up alive miles from home it
was as though the slightly terrorized, shaggy pup was a gift from
God.
   ``You've got to have certainties,'' Johnson said, tossing a
tattered garment into the bonfire. ``They give you hope, strength,
goals _ and everybody needs those because, evidently, what you own
is not for certain.''
   Tim and Donna still are thinking about what they want on their
son's headstone. Most likely, it will be something simple: Our
little Benny.
   ``Mommy, did Benjamin die?'' Abby asked not long after the
storm. ``He went to heaven, didn't he?''
   ``Yes, he did,'' Donna told her.
   ``We're telling the kids that he went to heaven. I think it
helps them,'' she said. ``But me, I just want him back.''

   An ill wind reached into Donna Ray's arms and wrested her
15-month-old son, thrusting Benjamin into the maelstrom. When the
tornado passed, wreckage of the Rays' lives was everywhere to see _
a trailer home reduced to rubble, broken bones, belongings strewn
for miles. And worst of all, the lifeless body of their only son,
the boy they had wanted so much. ``My little boy ... I was not
ready to give him up,'' says his father.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Private Actor Most at Home in Big Sky Country</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Presumed Innocent'' opens July 27.</NOTE>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just in from the Big Sky country, Harrison Ford
faced a peril as hazardous as any encountered by Han Solo and
Indiana Jones: the press tour.
   Ford is a private man, and he approaches an interview with the
zest of Roseanne Barr facing a diet. His verbal fencing, especially
on personal matters, is notorious with news types.
   Jim Brown of ``The Today Show'' recently tried to wheedle Ford
into disclosing the sex of his unborn baby. Ford knew, but declined
to say. The baby turned out to be a girl, born June 30.
   Unlike some major stars, Ford feels a responsibility to the
studios who pay him huge salaries for his work (upwards of $7
million). Hence he came here for two grueling days of radio, TV and
print interviews for ``Presumed Innocent,'' the Warner Bros. film
based on Scott Turow's blockbuster book. Also taking part were
co-stars Bonnie Bedelia, Brian Dennehy, Raul Julia and Paul
Winfield and director Alan J. Pakula.
   His co-workers had revealing things to say about Ford.
   Bedelia: ``(The film) was the first time I had met him. He's a
very interior type of person; he keeps his own counsel. I think
he's a marvelous actor. In this picture he was very _ soulful. .. .
He was very giving, generous, sensitive. A lovely man.''
   Winfield: ``Harrison and I first met when we were both under
contract to Columbia Pictures (in the mid-1960s). I was brought in
after the Watts riots because the studios decided they needed angry
young men, and I fit into that category. It was the end of the
contract period, and the only friend I made was Harrison. ... He
was the same as he is now. Except he's a lot richer.''
   Pakula: ``I thought of Harrison from the beginning. I wanted
someone who was like Everyman, who had an All-American kind of
quality. ... I am interested in characters who are two-sided, who
can be a collection of opposites.
   ``Harrison is very bright, he has a sense of storytelling,
especially a complicated story like this one. It's great to have
someone who says, `Have you told that?' `Does the audience
understand that?' `Explain that to me.' I said to my wife,
`Harrison asks simple questions that sometimes have very
complicated answers.'''
   Pakula added that he had worked with three people who became
Academy Award directors: James L. Brooks, Warren Beatty and Robert
Redford. Ford could have equal success if he wanted to turn
director, Pakula said. He doesn't. Acting is enough challenge for
him.
   In ``Presumed Innocent,'' Ford portrays a married prosecutor
accused of murdering a beautiful colleague (Greta Scacchi) with
whom he had a flaming affair. The role calls for greater depth of
feeling than Ford has displayed on the screen before. Nothing
unusual, he said.
   ``It seems to me it's the same job every time: trying to figure
out what the ideas are and to give them expression. The more of an
idea there is, the easier it is to give it life. This was a
character that was extremely well-written and had great complexity.
And the complexity was well-knit to the plot. It was really an easy
part to play.''
   Ford had not read the Turow novel, and he held off until he
could see the movie script, by Frank Pierson and Pakula.
   ``I didn't want to prejudice my impression of the screenplay,''
he said. ``I immediately read the book afterward. Then I worked
with Alan for six or eight months before the films started.''
   The role is far, far removed from Ford's portrayals in the
``Star Wars'' and ``Indiana Jones'' movies. Mixing drama and action
has been part of his strategy: ``It has always been my intention
that that might help to keep my career alive. I like doing
different kinds of films, I like facing different kinds of
challenges.''
   Ford grew up in suburban Chicago, drifted into acting at Ripon
College, mostly as a way to meet women. After a stint in summer
stock, he drove to California in 1964 with his new wife, Mary
Marquardt. The Columbia contract proved a dead end, and Harrison
made more money from carpentry than from acting.
   Did he grow impatient in those years?
   ``Often,'' he said. ``Impatient and frustrated. But when I look
back on it, I really did know from the very beginning that it was
the kind of job that took a long time to get into. And that the
really secret of it all was just outlasting the competition and not
giving up. As well as taking that period of time to develop your
craft and to mature.''
   Between building houses, Ford appeared in TV serials and such
films as ``The Conversation'' and ``American Graffiti.''
   ``When I went away to do `Star Wars,' I had the feeling that I
might be packing up my carpentry stuff for the last time,'' he
recalled. ``After that, I was able to work when I wanted to work.''
   Ford and his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Matheson (``E.T.
the Extra-Terrestrial''), make their home amid the Tetons of
Wyoming, about as far from the Hollywood scene as is possible. When
the actor goes filming, the entire family goes with him, including
son Malcolm, 3{, and, when they're able, two college-age sons from
the first marriage.
   Ford continues with drama in his next film, ``Regarding Henry,''
with Mike Nichols, his director in ``Working Girl.'' The role casts
Ford as a successful New York lawyer who becomes an amnesiac after
being shot in the head. Therapy allows him to reinvent his life and
relationships.
   And if Harrison Ford could reinvent his life?
   A faint grin appeared on the handsome face.
   ``I'm quite happy with what I've got. I can't imagine doing much
better.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Hitch-Hiking to Art</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BILL JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doc Tate Nevaquaya doesn't know what course
his life might have taken if his cousins hadn't happened along
while he was trying to hitch-hike.
   ``I was going to Oklahoma City to join the Marine Corps,''
recalls Nevaquaya. ``They bought me a ticket and put me on thece, Kansas,
to enroll in a trade school. I had 35 cents
in my pocket.''
   Times have changed for Nevaquaya since then. He no bus
for Lawrenw is an
internationally acclaimed artist whose work includes designing a
shield on the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery.
He also sold a painting to England's Queen Elizabeth II for about
$1,200.
   Nevaquaya paints in the traditional two-dimensional Indian
style, which often has the main object or feature outlined. Some
work is a flat dimension, resulting in a semi-abstract work. His
canvas, ``Native American Church,'' depicts 16 figures involved in
religious ceremonies.
   Nevaquaya's paintings range in price from $500 tp $7,000.
   Most of his work is done in watercolor. ``I feel that most
closely depicts the effects of the earth pigments,'' Nevaquaya
says. For some work, he mixes the watercd interest in the Indian flute.
The citation
hailed him for being ``one of the few remaining artists'' to link
past generations with the future.
   ``People have asked me to play the flute for everything from
banquets to weddings and church services,'' Nevaquaya says.
``Former U.S. Senator Fred Harris flew me to Washington to play at
the wedding of his daughter.''
   Nevaquaya also has been the subject of television documentaries,
has appeared with country music star Roy Clark, has played at the
Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington, and appeared on
British television while on a goodwill tour sponsored by the State
Department and the Smithsonian Institution. He has appeared in
concerts or lectures in Europe and the Far East.
   Nevaquaya has taken the Grand Award for his paintings at various
art shows, including exhibitions in Chicago and Albuquerque, N.M.
   However, there was a time when the future didn't look all that
bright.
   Nevaquaya, formally Joyce Lee Tate Nevaquaya, was orphaned when
he was 13. He lived for a time with an older brother in the
Apache-Fletcher area of rural southern Oklahoma. Both the nickname
Doc and the Joyce are in honor of Dr. C.W. Joyce, a physician for
whom many Indian children in the Fletcher area were named.
   It was while he was living with his brother that he started that
fateful trip to Oklahoma City to enlist in the Marines.
   ``I had just started hitch-hiking when my cousins picked me
up,'' Nevaquaya says. ``If they hadn't come by, within a few
minutes my whole life might have been changed.''
   Nevaquaya says his brother didn't know where he was or where he
had gone until he wrote him a letter from the trade school, which
now is Haskell Indian Junior College.
   Although Nevaquaya says he painted and sketched in the 1940s, he
stayed away from the art classes while attending the Fort Sill
Indian School because he did not like the policy that discouraged
all painting except portrayals of traditional Indian culture.
   His interest in art was honed by the fact that an early neighbor
had been Allan Houser, a painter who now is an acclaimed sculptor.
He later met and became friends with artist Black Moon Riddles.
   Although he sold a few of his paintings in the early 1950s, he
painted and sketched in his spare time while holding down a job.
Then, in 1955, Doris Littrell of Oklahoma City sought him out after
seeing some of his work at the Southern Plains Indian Museum in
Anadarko.
   From that point on, Nevaquaya made art his vocation.
   Nevaquaya is in demand for his expertise with the Indian flute
as are his paintings by collectors throughout the world. He
frequently holds workshops at high schools and colleges and has
taught his sons _ he has five, along with four daughters _ to play
the flute.
   But although his fortune has changed for the better, Nevaquaya
still lives in the rural town of Apache. And instead of a fancy
northern-lighted studio, he still paints at home, on a table in his
bedroom.

<HEAD>Music Makers: Chrissie Hynde Is Changing; Her Music Isn't</HEAD>

   Critics can be found in the strangest
places. Try the back seat of Chrissie Hynde's car.
   One evening this spring, the Pretenders leader popped a working
tape of her band's new album into the cassette deck of her car. She
drove in circles around Regents Park in London, trying to decide if
the running order of the songs made musical sense.
   Hynde's 5- and 7-year-old daughters were dozing in the back seat
_ or so she thought. Suddenly, a small voice peeped up from behind.
   ``Mummy,'' her youngest daughter asked. ``Can we hear `Sense of
Purpose' again?'''
   Smart kid. The longing-for-love ballad is probably the best of
12 songs on ``Packed,'' the first new Pretenders album since 1986.
   Since the early 1980 release of a debut Pretenders album that
has aged into a classic, Hynde's life _ and band _ have changed
considerably. Her music hasn't.
   Hynde is the only constant in the Pretenders' life. Over the
years, she's seen two band members die drug-related deaths, fired a
drummer and seen another guitarist quit to join Paul McCartney's
band.
   She insists the Pretenders are still a band, although she and
drummer Blair Cunningham are currently the only members. The search
is on for a guitarist and bass player in time for a tour of the
United States expected to start in late September.
   Hynde's two daughters are aware of what their mother does for a
living, but the car ride was the first time she remembered them
reacting to her work. They usually listen to their nanny's opera or
classical recordings.
   ``I feel like I'm more humanitarian because of my relationship
as a mother,'' she said during a recent interview. ``When I walk
through Central Park, I want to be seen in the community as a
mother. I don't want to be seen as a celebrity or a show business
figure.''
   Her children are the product of relationships with fellow
musicians Ray Davies of the Kinks and Jim Kerr of Simple Minds. She
married Kerr, but they're now separated.
   Motherhood hasn't necessarily softened the outspoken woman who
wrote ``Tattooed Love Boys'' _ just ask her opinion about the
nation's drug war. More about that later.
   But the differences in her life have obviously changed her
approach to work. It's the chief reason why there was a four-year
gap between Pretenders albums.
   ``Since I've been in the hotel the past week, I wake up at 6
o'clock in the morning and the first thing I do is reach for a
guitar,'' said Hynde, who was over from London for a publicity tour.
   ``I haven't done that for years,'' she said. ``When I'm home,
the first thing I do is go downstairs and turn the television off
and get breakfast together for the kids.''
   The new album, she said, is ``me going back down to my medium''
after recording her last disc while caring for an infant.
   ``Packed'' is a combination of hard-nosed rockers such as ``Hold
a Candle to This'' and ``Downtown (Akron)'' and such ballads as
``Let's Make a Pact'' and ``When Will I See You.''
   In spots, it sounds eerily like the first Pretenders album. Too
much so, for some critics' tastes, who've pointed out the
similarity of ``Packed'' to some of Hynde's past work. Most often
cited is the mournful first single, ``Never Do That,'' a close
cousin to ``Back on the Chain Gang.''
   That's OK, Hynde said. Let them all talk.
   ``They're allowed to say whatever they want,'' she said. ``If
that's how they see it, that's how they see it. Fine. I use the
same five chords, rearrange them, talk about different things and
have different melodies. I don't consciously think, `Oh no, this
sounds too much like something else.'''
   ``Packed'' contains Hynde's second song about her hometown of
Akron, Ohio. The first, ``My City Was Gone,'' bemoans the city's
economic slump. ``Downtown'' is about how the 1980s mall culture
affected the city.
   The critical eye she displays in the two songs doesn't lessen
her feelings for her hometown _ she said she had a great time in
her most recent visit. Hynde even toyed with the idea of buying a
house where she used to live in the early 1970s, but was
sidetracked when she got back to London.
   That visit also taught the 37-year-old Hynde, an art student at
Kent State University at the time of Vietnam War demonstrations,
how things have changed in the country she left in the mid-1970s.
   ``When I went to my high school reunion and tried to roll a
joint, half the room turned into my parents,'' she said, and she's
angry about the ``right-wing fervor'' that has lumped marijuana use
with harder drugs as criminal behavior.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I reserve the right to smoke an herb
that grows in the ground,'' she said. ``I don't drink. I don't
smoke cigarettes. I don't take any drugs. I'm completely
vegetarian. I lead a nice, clean, easy life and don't cause any
trouble. The fact that I'm automatically of a criminal status
because I smoke pot ...'' Her voice trailed off.
   Hynde's musical career took shape in London's fertile punk scene
during the late 1970s.
   These days, she's found planning a tour is a lot more
complicated than piling everyone into a van; Hynde may be the first
rocker whose work schedule may be partly governed by her nanny.
   ``My nanny's in school training to be a dance therapist for deaf
children,'' she said. ``I am sort of planning my career around her
schedule because I like her, she's part of the family and it's
important to have a secure setup. It's give and take.''

   Irving Berlin once insisted there were nine
rules to writing popular songs.
   They must be original, easy to sing, easy to remember,
``sexless'' so that a man or woman could perform them and should
have attention-getting titles. But most important, Berlin stated,
``The song writer must look upon his work as a business, that is,
to make a success of it, he must work and work, and then WORK.''
   And he meant it. American music, it seems, was created on a
thousand restless nights by a shy little man with a high voice who
insisted, ``I sweat blood between 3 and 6 many mornings, and when
the drops that fall off my forehead hit the paper they're notes.''
   He liked to write in the evening, sleep in the morning and pitch
songs in the afternoon; sometimes he didn't bother sleeping.
   On a winter's night in 1941, Berlin began working on ``White
Christmas.'' He finished it the next morning and raced over to his
office, telling his stunned transcriber that ``not only is it the
best song I ever wrote, it's the best song anybody ever wrote.''
   Berlin always seemed to have a plan. In 1909, he set himself a
goal of writing four to five songs a night, creating an enormous
backlog of unused or ``trunk songs'' _ ``God Bless America'' among
them.
   Nearly 80 years later, Steven Spielberg tried to negotiate for
film rights to the great love song ``Always,'' but the director was
curtly informed that Berlin wanted to use it for a project _ never
started _ of his own. The movie, also called ``Always,'' was
released in December 1989, three months after the songwriter's
death at age 101.
   What kept him going? According to Laurence Bergreen, author of
the comprehensive biography ``As Thousands Cheer: The Life of
Irving Berlin'' ($24.95, Viking), it wasn't love or greed or even
artistic ambition. The sound of applause, the need for the public's
approval was the songwriter's greatest inspiration, the author said.
   ``He began by singing for pennies and nickels in the sidewalks
of New York,'' explained Bergreen, also author of ``James Agee: A
Life.''
   ``If people liked what he sang they gave him money and if they
didn't like it, they didn't give him money and he didn't eat.
   ``You wrote songs. They were performed, and the audience heard
it. You would stay up all night and fix it to and try to make it
better. That's how you developed, with the immediate feedback.''
   Bergreen raises the same question again and again: How did
Berlin remain so prolific for so long? How did he change with the
times for nearly 40 years until another self-made man named Elvis
Presley redefined popular music and pushed a frustrated Berlin into
retirement?
   ``He was totally market driven,'' Bergreen said. ``I think
what's remarkable is that every 10 years or so he tried to reinvent
himself as a songwriter; popular songwriters then tended to come
and go as quickly as they do now.
   ``He consciously adapted himself to changing styles. Ragtime in
the 'teens (`Alexander's Ragtime Band') to sob songs in the '20s
(`Always') to romantic ballads (`Cheek to Cheek') in the '30s. In
the '40s, you notice a pronounced influence of swing music (`I Got
the Sun in the Morning').''
   Irving Berlin was born Israel Baline on May 11, 1888, the son of
a Russian cantor and one of eight children. His family emigrated to
the United States in 1893 and settled into the heavily populated
Jewish community of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
   While his parents and siblings stuck to the ways of the old
country, even speaking in Yiddish, Berlin raced into the new world,
hustling to get out of his family's cramped, dirty tenement as
quickly as possible and make it to the classy world that waited
uptown.
   He hawked newspapers, spoke in colorful New York slang, earned
coins as a singing waiter. Eventually, he changed his name and
tried writing his own songs, reasoning, ``Once you start singing,
you start thinking of writing songs, it's as simple as that.''
   He wrote his first song, ``Marie From Sunny Italy,'' in 1908 and
soon joined a music publishing house called Waterson &amp; Snyder. In
1911, Berlin contributed four songs to the Ziegfield Follies, and
hammered out ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' a lively update of the
``classic'' ragtime made popular by Scott Joplin in 1899.
   Like any quick-thinking kid, Berlin was looking for an angle, a
gimmick _ some way to grab onto a trend _ and seized on ragtime as
the answer. But he was also willing to take chances, play with the
rules and invent the rules.
   ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' the name inspired by the
derogatorially named ``coon'' songs that had ``Alexander'' in the
title, combined popular black and white music, mixing ragtime and
march. The chorus ran 32 bars, double the usual length, and the
song changed key in mid-course, another innovation.
   ``I humbly began to study my own song, asking myself, `Why?'
`Why?','' Berlin recalled in 1915, reflecting on its international
success.
   ``And I got an answer. ... It's opening words, emphasized by
immediate repitition _ `Come on and hear! Come on and hear!' _ were
an invitation to `come' and join in, and `hear' the singer and his
song.''
   ``There were distinctive yard marks in his songs that you could
see,'' Bergreen said. ```Puttin' on the Ritz' on the one hand and
`God Bless America' as the other. You had anthems of basic American
events: `White Christmas,' `Easter Parade'; ragtime songs like
`Alexander's Ragtime Band.'
   ``And there was the counterpoint song, `Just in Love,' `Play a
Simple Melody,' `An Old Fashioned Wedding.' There were two songs
kind of going at the same time, two singers singing against each
other.''
   Berlin could neither read nor write music and his business
skills were equally crude, equally effective. He had dropped out of
school at age 14 to earn money and had to scramble around town,
pitching his songs to publishers; until his death in 1989, his
office never had a computer.
   But if Berlin sweated blood as a businessman, the drops that
fell quickly turned to cash. He realized early on that publishing
was where the most money could be made and held on stubbornly to
the rights of his songs, boasting for years that he received the
highest royalty payments in the nation.

   ``I think there are twin facts of the same painstaking
approach,'' Bergreen said. ``He was just as careful at selling
songs as he was writing them. He would make the rounds of the music
stores to make sure the sheet music was stocked on the shelfs, and
would get angry if it wasn't selling.''
   Berlin's last major success came in 1950 with the musical ``Call
Me Madam.'' Five years later, rock 'n' roll ended his career and
those of many Tin Pan Alley writers.
   ``He came to a country where you could do anything you want,''
Bergreen said. ``His patriotism was incredible; it was his
religion. That's what he believed in, `God Bless America,' a
merging of patriotic and religious sentiments.
   ``With the rise of rock 'n' roll, everything he stood for, Tin
Pan Alley and classical writing and the American values went out of
favor.''
   Berlin tried. In 1962, he broke a five-year silence and
announced he was working on a musical satire on the Kennedys called
``Mr. President.'' There were 22 songs, including ``Washington
Twist,'' a take on the latest dance craze. More than $1 million
worth of tickets were sold before the cast was even announced.
   It was a disaster. Elliot Norton of the Record American in
Boston labeled it ``Dreadful ... Anything milder would be
misleading, not to say dishonest.'' When the show opened at the
National Theatre in Washington, President Kennedy didn't show up
until the second act and left soon after. Six months later, with
advance tickets used up, the show quickly closed.
   ``You don't have to stop yourself (from writing songs),'' a
shaken Berlin said in a radio interview. ``The people who have to
listen to your songs tell you to stop.''
   Berlin outlived his peers _ Harold Arlen, George Gershwin, Cole
Porter, Jerome Kern. He outlived his siblings. He outlived his two
favorite performers, Ethel Merman and Fred Astaire. He outlived his
wife of more than 60 years, Ellin Mackey, who died on July 29, 1988.
   And he even outlived some of his songs. In 1986, ``Alexander's
Ragtime Band'' turned 75, lost its protection under United States
copyright law and became part of the public domain, an area Berlin
himself had long occupied.
   He hoped that Hollywood would produce a musical retrospective of
his work, ``Say It With Music,'' but the deal fell through. Berlin
spent most of his remaining years in virtual seclusion, refusing
interviews and making angry, profanity-laced phone calls to
journalists and friends who talked about him publicly.
   ``He stayed at his house in Manhattan,'' Bergreen said. ``He
watched a lot of television and rarely saw anyone except for the
barber or his doctor or servants.
   ``He built up a small network of music historians and pundits in
the field of popular music, and would endlessly talk shop with
them. Also Harold Arlen; that was how he stayed in touch with the
world.''
   Berlin avoided tributes, including a lavish celebration of his
100th birthday at Carnegie Hall that featured Frank Sinatra,
Leonard Bernstein and a chorus of Girl and Boy Scouts.
   He did, however, appear before an audience one last time.
   John Wallowitch, a composer and cabaret singer, had lived near
the songwriter for years and the two occasionally chatted in the
street. He soon began an annual tradition. On Christmas Eve,
Wallowitch would stop in front of Berlin's building and softly sing
``White Christmas,'' his own private ceremony.
   Soon, others joined him, and they began to sing out loud. By
1983, there were 17 carolers.
   ``It was 4 degrees and the place was dark,'' Wallowitch recalled
in a telephone interview. ``I never thought he was there; it was
just symbolic. But one friend of mine said we should ring the
droobell, he might be there.
   ``I finally rang the bell and the housekeeper answered. We said
we were serenading Mr. Berlin and she said she was going to tell
him. He came down in his bathrobe and slippers and invited us in.
He said it was the nicest Christmas present he ever had.
   ``We told him we were coming back for the next 77 years to do
that, and he said, `Good, good.' We were all in a state of shock.
We floated out of there and went back to my house. We sang his
songs for 2{ hours _ without repeating one of them.''

<NOTE>Eds: ``Arachnophobia'' opens July 18; ``Ford Fairlane'' opened

<TEXT>
   
   ``Arachnophobia''
   Just when you thought it was safe to go play in the barn, along
comes a spider who makes killer bees look like Bambi.
   Frank Marshall's ``Arachnophobia'' is the first release from the
Walt Disney Co.'s new Hollywood Pictures and Steven Spielberg's
Amblin Entertainment. Spielberg is also co-executive producer with
Marshall.
   The movie has all the slick production values of a Spielberg
venture, as well as the picture book Americana that seem to
permeate his movies. It also is highly derivative of other scare
movies, even down to the Norman Bates shower scene (in this case,
the specter of death is a spider).
   But is ``Arachnophobia'' really, really scary? No. Is it
unsettling? On occasion. Is it amusing? Sometimes. Is it
entertaining? Yes.
   The movie opens in the plump rain forests of Venezuela where Dr.
James Atherton (Julian Sands) is seeking new insects for tagging
and study. His photographer, Jerry Manley, is bitten by a huge
spider and dies. Only, no one really knows it was a spider bite
that did him in. His body is shipped back to his hometown, Canaima,
Calif. (named by the filmmakers after the Venezuelan town where the
movie was filmed), with a stowaway _ the spider.
   Once in the Canaima mortuary (with the ancient gag of a
sandwich-chomping undertaker), the spider escapes to the outside
world, terrorizing a dog and cat. A hungry grackle plucks up the
spider in its beak. The spider bites the bird and the feathered
creature falls dead right in front of the barn of the Jennings
family, who have just moved from the perils of San Francisco for
the safety of the country.
   Oh happy day! New meat.
   Ross Jennings (Jeff Daniels) is a family doctor, about to take
over the practice of a country quack, Sam Metcalf (Henry Jones),
who at the last minute decides to stay on. With the first death
from a spider bite _ Jennings' one and only patient _ the two
doctors lock heads over cause of death and an autopsy.
   The next victim is also someone Jennings' examines, and he soons
earns the nickname _ even from his own kids _ of Dr. Death.
   The victims multiply and so do the arachnids.
   There are the usual near-misses: Jennings' daughter, Shelley, is
playing with the her friend, Bunny Beechwood. A spider nears her
foot, ready to bite. She doesn't see him, but springs to her feet
just as he's a lick away, drops a book on top and then nonchalantly
steps on the book.
   There are also the usual mis-sightings: Jennings awakens in the
middle of the night in a cold sweat, staring at the wall beyond the
bed he shares with his wife, Molly (Harley Jane Kozak). There's a
spot ... and ... it ... looks ... like ... A GIANT UGLY SPIDER. He
eases from the bed to the wall, but even before his toe touches the
floor, we know it's a coat hook, and the thrill that should come
from his approach simply isn't there.
   But what ``Arachnophobia'' lacks in chills, it more than makes
up for in humor, thanks especially to John Goodman as Delbert
McClintock (Bugs Begone exterminating company), the Rambo of bug
exterminators. Delbert reaches into his truck for his ``private
stock'' bug killer, straps on the nozzles and outfits himself for
bug war: ``Now let's rock 'n' roll.''
   He makes our day. He also makes this movie because, by and
large, ``Arachnobobia'' lacks bite. It doesn't have the mystical
unknown of Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Birds,'' or the savage unknown
of ``Jaws.'' All is just too predictable, too pat and too cute.
   Steven Kutcher's spider unit, the guys who handle the real live
critters, does a good job of rounding up the arachnids. The
well-trained little devils sure can make their marks. The specially
created spider was designed by Chris Walas, and works with menace.
   Mikael Salomon's photography is lovely, especially the early
vistas of Venezuela and the intricate lacework of the webbing in
the barn.
   The movie is rated PG-13. The spider violence and deaths may be
difficult for younger members of the audience or for the squeamish.

   ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane''
   Joe Silver proves the ideal force to bring Andrew Dice Clay to
the screen. The producer of the ``Die Hard,'' ``Lethal Weapon'' and
``Predator'' movies is, of course, the ``King of the Lowest Common
Denominator.'' He has an absolute knack for spending megabucks on
films that are full of flash, with no redeeming social values.
   ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane'' fits neatly into this Silver
pattern. Expensive cars explode. A luxury beach house blown up.
Point-blank killings. Fights atop a tall building. Heavy metal
sound track. Language that would make a rap singer blush.
   All this plus the Diceman's brand of comedy. No, he doesn't
parade his notorious gay and female putdowns. But the level of
humor remains below the belt, with matching nomenclature. Lots of
oral sex jokes, spoken and visual. Colorful asides to set the
frat-house boys sniggering.
   There's a plot, sort of. Clay is Ford Fairlane, an L.A. private
eye who specializes in rock music cases. A dull-witted Philip
Marlowe, he bumbles his way through murders, drug deals and
high-level deceptions (Is the music world really that venal?).
   Fairlane is assisted by his sleek secretary (Lauren Holly) and a
ditzy groupie (Brandon Call) and beset by a host of opponents,
including an oily executive (Wayne Newton), his slinky ex-wife
(Priscilla Presley) and a cockney crazy (Robert Englund, a.k.a.
Freddy Krueger of the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' pictures).
   The taste of the film is sometimes astonishing. A college
sorority is portrayed as some kind of sex academy. A long sequence
takes place in a cemetery, where a limo and a hearse stage a
murderous chase, scattering mourners and toppling gravestones.
   And what about Andrew Dice Clay in his starring debut (he has
had smaller film roles)? He seems to have studied the Howard
Cossell school of elocution, pausing ... between ... each ... word.
His expressions range from distaste to smirk. There may be more
Fords in his future, but his versatility remains unanswered.
   Finnish director Renny Harlin, who also directed ``Die Hard 2,''
knows how to maintain a frenzied pace. Daniel Waters, James Cappe
and David Arnott labored on the mindless script, apparently working
from the Joel Silver handbook. Steve Perry co-produced.
   ``The Adventures of Ford Fairlane'' is a 20th Century Fox
release rated R for all the above reasons and more. Running time:
96 minutes.

   ``All Dogs Go the Heaven'' (MGM-UA Home Video. Rated G)
   
   Charlie, a hoodlum mutt, is in the slammer. But not for long.
His faithful pal, Itchy, is about to liberate him. And where's the
first place Charlie the escaped con-dog goes? Carface's honky-tonk.
   Carface, a cigar-chewing bulldog with a heart of nails, runs the
type of gin joint where people, er, dogs drink cheap booze and
fight at the drop of a bone. Carface is also the dog who framed
Charlie.
   And Carface clearly does not want Charlie around anymore, so
Carface kills him with his car, and Charlie is quickly dispatched
to ... heaven.
   Years ago, this easily could have been the set-up and plot for a
James Cagney or John Garfield gangster flick. But would you believe
an animated feature for children?
   Don Bluth's ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' is the second major
animated feature to come out this fall, going up against Walt
Disney's ``The Little Mermaid.'' But where Disney's has very little
to frighten or rattle a 5-year-old except a mean sea witch, Bluth's
effort dallies in the hereafter with haunting visions of hell and
death.
   Charlie decides he really doesn't want to stay in heaven. It's
soooooo boring! He turns back his ``life watch'' and returns to
Earth, with a warning from the Whippet Angel that he can't come
back.
   Once back to his old haunts, he discovers that Carface has a
little girl named Anne-Marie who can talk to animals _ like race
horses. With Anne-Marie as hostage, Carface never loses at the
track! Charlie lures the little girl away with promises of helping
her find a mommy and daddy. Anne-Marie is an orphan but we never
know how or when her parents died or how she's managed to make it
on her own.
   Charlie uses Anne-Marie, abusing her love and loyalty, but in
the end, saves her life by giving up his own. His reward is heaven.
   Along the way, we meet a lady dog, Charlie's good friend, and
her several puppies. There is a strong suggestion here that Charlie
might be the dad. There's also the overblown and ferocious King
Gator, who leads a pack of cannibalistic rats in an underground
kingdom.
   King Gator is a questionable character, an almost racist
concept. He has large lips and speaks in a distinctive black ghetto
lingo (Ken Page does the voice). Though a hero of sorts in the
story, he is nevertheless offensive and presents the kind of racial
stereotype that should have been gone from movies _ especially
children's movies _ by now.
   Bluth, who led a dozen young artists out of Disney in 1979 and
set up his own company, is a talented animator but he misses with
his backgrounds and scenery. There is no three-dimensional
richness, just painted flats that look washed-out and ordinary.
   He's good with action, but often it is too busy. In a scene at
Carface's club, there's so much going on and so many dogs romping
about that much of the scene is missed.
   Burt Reynolds provides the voice for Charlie and Dom De Luise
does Itchy. Other voices include Melba Moore, Whippet Angel;
Charles Nelson Reilly, Killer; Judith Barsi, Anne-Marie; Loni
Anderson, Flo; Candy Devine, Vera.
   Serviceable but unmemorable tunes are provided by Charles
Strouse and T.J. Kuenster. Ralph Burns did the score.
   ``All Dogs Go to Heaven'' will never be an animated classic,
such as ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' or ``Bambi,'' but it is
enjoyable entertainment for the entire family.
   The United Artists release, in association with Goldcrest Films,
is produced by Sullivan Bluth Studios Ireland Ltd. The rating is G,
but small youngsters might be unnerved by some scenes and probably
won't understand much of the plot.

   Dmitri Hvorostovksy sings Tchaikovsky and Verdi Arias (Philips)
_ The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev
_ compact disc
   
   A year ago, no one had heard of Dmitri Hvorostovsky. Now, on the
strength of a few concerts, the name of the 28-year-old baritone
from Siberia is in the air as the next sensation about to hit major
opera houses around the world.
   Is it all hype or is the fuss justified? Based on his first
recording, a collection of Tchaikovsky and Verdi arias, it's by no
means hype.
   He possesses a baritone voice of unusual beauty. It's a
good-size voice, too, one that should be capable of nicely filling
even the biggest houses. He's got phenomenal breath control,
spinning out the longest phrases with no apparent difficulty. And
he's an artist, using his voice with considerable sensitivity and
attention to the meaning of the words.
   If there's a ``But,'' it's some doubt about his upper register,
which is impressive but doesn't have quite the same mellow sound as
the rest of his voice. It may be that it will fill out in time _ or
it may be a sign of vocal dangers ahead.
   Hvorostovsky, just 28, won the BBC's Cardiff Singer of the World
Competition last summer in a nationally televised performance. He
has since drawn ecstatic reviews for concerts at London's Wigmore
Hall and at New York's Avery Fisher Hall and will soon be making
opera debuts at Covent Garden, La Scala and San Francisco.
   His debut album is a collection of mostly familiar arias. The
biggest rarities are from Tchaikovsky's ``Sorceress'' and
``Iolanthe.'' When it comes to the Verdi, Hvorostovsky makes even
the warhorses sound fresh _ the elder Germont's ``Di Provenza il
mar'' from ``La Traviata,'' for example.
   Great Verdi baritones have been in short supply since the days
of the late Leonard Warren and Tito Gobbi. Robert Merrill and
Cornell MacNeil were among the best of his successors, and now, at
last, there may be another.

   ``A Round and a Bout'' (IRS) _ Squeeze
   
   When Squeeze came onto the pop scene more than a decade ago,
critics hailed songwriters Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook as
their generation's Lennon and McCartney. But record sales have
failed to match Squeeze's lofty reputation, and promising young
songwriting teams today are rarely referred to as the new Difford
and Tilbrook.
   Blame the fickle music marketplace, because ``A Round and a
Bout,'' a live album of main Squeeze favorites from as far back as
1978, shows that Difford and Tilbrook lived up to their early
billing. These songs are terrific, and it's likely that if one of
the older ones had broken into the Top 40, others would have
followed.
   ``A Round and a Bout'' also shows that Squeeze remains a
top-notch act. The band, recorded at two concerts in January,
performs 15 songs with both respect for the original versions and a
playfulness that puts a new twist on the arrangements.
   Given that Squeeze has played about 900 concerts since 1974 _
the date and site of each is listed in the liner notes _ it's no
surprise that the band is terrific live. Helping to make it that
way are the diverse piano stylings of Jools Holland (who has since
left the band), and some remarkable vocal harmonies, particularly
on ``Black Coffee in Bed'' and ``Hour Glass.'' Milli Vanilli this
ain't.
   But the band's strength is the songs themselves. One bright,
catchy melody gives way to another, while the themes vary from the
sublime (``Up the Junction'') to the ridiculous (``She Doesn't Have
to Shave'').
   A quibble: Because lead singers Difford and Tilbrook are
difficult to understand, their clever couplets are easy to miss.
The album should have included printed lyrics. Still, for the many
millions who have yet to buy their first Squeeze record, ``A Round
and a Bout'' is a good primer.

   Boat Songs of 18th Century Venice (Tactus) _ Cristina Miatello,
soprano; Carlo Gaifa, tenor; Enrico Gatti, baroque violin; Massimo
Lonardi, lute and guitar; Ugo Nastrucci, theorbo and baroque
guitar; Guido Morini, clavicembalo
   
   This Italian compact disc is a complete delight. The songs and
instrumental works expertly performed here presumably were played
in gondolas floating down the canals of Venice, and with their
light-hearted romance and easy charm that's not hard to imagine.
   The pieces fall somewhere between ``serious'' and popular music,
with the song texts in Venetian dialect. The singers are excellent
_ and native Venetians, to boot.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In big cities like New York where most people
live in apartments, the perennial desire is for just a few feet
more of closet space. Having space to squander is the greatest
luxury of all.
   Burton Kassell has plenty of closets and more than enough rooms
in his five-story limestone-front home on the upper west side of
Manhattan. But he has discovered that space alone is not enough.
   Recently, after 19 years of solving one decorating problem at a
time, piecemeal, he hired designer Rivka Schoenfeld to reduce the
confusion by working out a better floor plan. At the same time, he
asked her to help him weed out furnishings and collectibles and to
redecorate some of the rooms.
   Built as a private family home at the turn of the century, the
house had been turned into eight apartments when Kassell bought it
in 1971. He and his wife and children lived on one floor, and the
other four floors were divided into seven apartments. Over the
years, as tenants moved out and his finances improved, Kassell took
over additional floors for his own use until by the end of 1987, he
had the whole building to himself.
   He wanted to create a separate apartment for each of two grown
children, ages 25 and 21, a weekend home for two other children by
a second marriage, ages 12 and 10, as well as a three-story space
for himself.
   Considering the changes over the years, it's hardly surprising
that when Schoenfeld first saw the house, her reaction was, ``It's
a mess.
   ``The proportions and ambience of the building were Victorian
and heavy. We wanted to pierce this heaviness with actual physical
light and a feeling of openness and space,'' she says.
   With this goal in mind, Kassell and Schoenfeld chose a middle
course between restoration and modernization. They wanted to keep a
turn-of-the-century feeling without disguising its use as a
20th-century home.
   Schoenfeld suggested plain plastered walls painted white.
Moldings that were not authentic to the orginal house were removed,
and ceilings were replastered. Much of the work was basic
improvement and renovation, like the upgraded electrical system.
Track lighting was installed, as was stereo equipment, a multi-room
control system, and a security system. All seven fireplaces in the
house were put into working order.
   Since there was so much wood _ floors, wainscoting, some
moldings and built-in cabinetry _ Schoenfeld suggested furnishings
made of other materials such as glass and steel, for contrast.
   In the living room, for example, seating is covered in white
fabric. The coffee table is steel, and the only other significant
furniture in the room is a low metal-framed piece with open
shelving along the wall opposite the fireplace. There are stone
shelves below and a glass shelf at waist level, where Kassell
displays collectibles and memorabilia and stores sound equipment
and books.
   Not every room conveys the same feeling. While the living room
projects a contemporary ambience, the dining room is more
traditional in mood. Oak wainscoting, eight and a half feet high,
forms a backdrop to the large dining table designed by Gustav
Stickley of the turn-of-the-century American arts and crafts
movement. To provide counterpoint, a large modern lighting fixture
hangs directly over the table.
   The kitchen, which had been redone 10 years earlier, did not
need to be touched. This pleasing room wears its past and present
with distinction. By removing many layers of accumulated paint,
Kassell exposed the kitchen's original honey-color oak cabinetry,
and a carpenter matched some new sections to it. A cabinet from a
butler's pantry was a gift from neighbors during their own
renovation. Butcher block countertops, tile flooring and a
restaurant stove give this room an old-fashioned and romantic feel.
   Space and quality materials work together to make the 10- by
20-foot master bath perhaps the most luxurious in the house. The
gleaming and expansive white-tiled room has a wall of new windows,
a separate shower, whirlpool bath, and a freestanding sink. Kassell
says the room is in some ways his favorite because he was able to
create more of it. The other rooms were already complete, and only
minor changes could be made.
   Living in a private home in a big city is not without problems.
``You are your own super and are responsible for all the
maintenance, and it's difficult, costly and frustrating to get
things repaired,'' says Kassell. Yet, it offers ``the luxury of
space, the feeling of home, a basement for all your junk.''
   The monetary value of the house and the neighborhood have both
risen substantially since he bought the property for $74,500, says
Kassell. Renovation has cost several hundred thousand dollars more.
   Its latest redo has brought the house full circle. It started as
a comfortable family home and now has returned to this enviable
state. The results, says Kassell, have been worth the effort and
expense.

   When it comes to making decorating changes, most
people tend to let well enough alone. But when they move, they may
decide that well enough can be improved on.
   Judith and Martin Gura went from formality and dark woods to
pale colors and informal furnishings when they moved from a large
family place to a small apartment in a new high-rise on New York's
waterfront.
   ``It was like moving to a different city,'' says Judith Gura,
co-owner with her husband of a public relations firm.
   With their children grown, the Guras decided it was time for a
change. So they sold their three-bedroom apartment on the upper
west side of the city to move to a small two-bedroom rental at
Battery Park City, built on a landfill in the Hudson River at
Manhattan's tip.
   When completed, the area will be a mix of high-rise apartments,
offices, shops and a marina. Meanwhile, residents are urban
pioneers of a sort who make do without some conveniences, such as a
nearby supermarket. The compensation is a waterfront neighborhood
that has an almost suburban feeling, especially evenings and
weekends when the daytime workforce is gone. There is plenty of
sun, light, view, and access to water.
   Mrs. Gura, who describes her new neighbors as ``mostly all
single people,'' had to severely prune possessions accumulated over
two decades of family life.
   ``The books were the only really hard thing to give up. Letting
go of the rest was an unburdening,'' she says. To cushion the shock
and absorb the overflow, the couple rented off-premises storage
space to hold things like bicycles, furniture to start their son
out in his first apartment, and such encumbrances as a fish poacher
and a lobster pot which ``will probably eventually go.''
   As a publicist whose specialty is the home furnishings industry,
Mrs. Gura knows many designers with whom she could have worked.
However, she decided to do the decorating herself. She and her
husband opted for a much less formal home than they were used to.
Although they ended up bringing much of their furniture with them
in the move, they made enough changes to feel they were starting
over.
   The dark wood floors, Oriental rugs and elaborate window
treatments are gone. These days, they live in light. There are no
formal window treatments _ just some thin blinds in the bedroom.
They enjoy their river views from rooms with white walls.
   Their new apartment is about half the size of the old place, but
its two terraces and great views give it an expansive feeling.
``The first thing I did was to buy outdoor furniture and a barbecue
grill,'' says Mrs. Gura.
   They also bought a new sofa, marble dining table and
oatmeal-colored Berber-style carpet for all the floors. They had
their old dining chairs recaned. Originally, they planned to buy
new bedroom furniture, but when told it would cost $6,000, they
decided to keep what they had.
   They discovered that some of the modern pieces they'd purchased
new in the 1950s and 1960s, such as chairs by Arne Jacobssen and
Marcel Breuer, qualify as collectibles, so they had them
refurbished.
   All the things they brought _ including the craft and art
collections _ look different in their new setting, she says.
``Everything looks much fresher, partly because we've rearranged
things. For example, we put all the crafts in one place on an
etagere.''
   Smaller space is not always worse, says Mrs. Gura, since the
corridor kitchen she uses now is more efficient than the larger one
she formerly had. She got rid of many gadgets and serving pieces
before moving. Gone are the yogurt maker and the clay pot ``and
about a million casseroles.''
   Nevertheless, she describes the moving process as ``really
painless. The day we walked out on 22 years of living, we didn't
feel bad, and I haven't thought of the old place since we left.''
   The other apartment had been chosen as a place to rear children.
``This time we have chosen just what we wanted,'' she says.
   Such a course does not come cheaply. The Guras pay nearly $3,000
a month in rent, almost double the monthly maintenance payments for
their old apartment. ``We sold the old apartment profitably and
invested the money.'' They decided to rent because they did not
want to be tied down by ownership. They put the cost of their move,
including the moving company, reupholstery, purchase of new
furnishings and storage at between $15,000 and $20,000.
   Mrs. Gura says she and her husband acted out of character in
their quickly accomplished move. Usually, they weigh every decision
and do a great deal of comparison shopping. They liked Battery Park
City so much the first time they saw it that they stopped looking
elsewhere. Within a month they signed the lease.

   It's amazing what paint, floor coverings and
some lively furniture can do for a house. As legions of energetic
people are proving all over the country, redoing a handyman's
special is still the fastest _ and often the only affordable _
route to satisfying home ownership.
   Take Richard Marencic, 31, and Sarah Vogt, 29, of Philadelphia.
This married couple bought a modest row house slightly outside the
city center for $64,000. Without spending a lot more _ only about
$20,000 over five years _ they won a contest sponsored by
Philadelphia magazine for their imaginative furnishings and setting.
   Marencic, a 1981 graduate of the University of Michigan's design
school, and Vogt, a fine arts graduate of Moore College of Art in
Philadelphia, chose the small three-bedroom row house in a working
class neighborhood near the Philadelphia Museum of Art because it
was convenient and they could afford it, with a little financial
help from his father.
   Though only about 1,200 square feet, excluding the basement, the
small house has room for a studio for each. The location is
convenient to Vogt's job as assistant manager of the Philadelphia
museum store and Marencic's job as an interior designer with Daroff
Design Inc. What it needed most was a large helping of style.
   As a designer, Marencic was able to come up with a number of
inexpensive but stylish stratagems. The couple hired a contractor
to handle technical matters, then did some of the work themselves
to save money.
   So far, they have replaced virtually all surfaces on the first
floor, fixed a leaky roof, removed partitions, old flooring and
wallcoverings, redone ceilings and upgraded plumbing and electrical
systems.
   ``Our idea is to use furnishings rather than architecture to
create interest in the house. As designers we enjoy being able to
change the looks of our rooms,'' says Marencic, who is a co-founder
of Tabula Rasa, a local group of architects and artists who exhibit
their artwork and who are interested in interrelationships among
various media.
   Marencic designed and built the dining room table, two etageres,
two dining chairs and a number of art constructions. Virtually all
the art objects and framed art in the house was made by the couple
or their friends.
   As designers, they enjoy combining many different styles. They
updated old things with new colors or fabrics. For example, some
boxy blond sunporch furniture from the 1950s has been given a new
twist with a jazzy new fabric that looks a bit like a Jackson
Pollock canvas with its abstract mix of purple, magenta, green,
black and white blotches.
   From the outside, their house is almost identical to the others
in the row. It has an indoor porch, living room, separate dining
room, kitchen and small back deck on the first floor. The deck was
rotten and had to be replaced _ a project they planned jointly with
their next-door neighbor.
   Marencic provided the design: wooden planks laid on the diagonal
and a privacy screen made of strips of wood to create the illusion
of more space. A small round table with two chairs, a barbecue
grill, and several small containers filled with flowering annuals
make it a pleasant spot for Sunday breakfast or an afternoon snack.
   Inside, the floor plan no longer resembles those of neighboring
houses. There is a clear view from kitchen to sunporch, with most
obstructing walls taken down. Those that are left have been painted
white. A black and white scheme predominates.
   For the kitchen, the couple purchased self-assembly furniture _
inexpensive white cabinetry with simple U-shaped hardware. Black
laminate countertops have been installed.
   The kitchen layout has been slightly rearranged to make room for
a large peninsula that surrounds the sink. Perched on a stool at
this counter, used for quick meals and as a buffet surface for
parties, one can see through to the sunporch. The floor has been
tiled in a rosy terra cotta tile.
   Throughout the house the basic black and white background has
been enlivened with a range of Memphis-inspired colors such as
aqua, rose and purple.
   Marencic's furniture designs, too, are inspired by the funky
Memphis look with its odd angles and curves. His enjoyment of the
offbeat also is evident in the window coverings _ translucent
plexiglass screens which he sanded for privacy. Small triangular
cutouts create a peekaboo effect that amuses him.
   The couple had a pleasant surprise when they removed existing
shag carpeting: oak flooring. They finished it by buffing.
   ``We take a common-sense approach to redecorating to keep costs
down but still give us a place we can enjoy,'' says Marencic. For
example, instead of ripping out a bad ceiling, he repaired it and
covered it with sheetrock _ not orthodox but less expensive and
acceptable to him.
   Now that the main floor is complete, the Marencics are tackling
the second floor. The master bedroom and bath are two current
projects. Two other bedrooms upstairs are used as working studios.
``The downstairs was mostly Rick. The upstairs is going to be
mostly Sarah,'' he says.

   Home can be a feeling about a place as well as
the place itself, which explains why even an unconventional spot
can make a satisfying place to live.
   The Sussman family of Chicago, for example, enjoys living in a
spacious three-bedroom apartment that is sequestered on the second
floor of Woodward Court, a dormitory at the University of Chicago.
Each fall they welcome about 150 new students as an extended family.
   As house masters, Arthur Sussman, who is also the university's
general counsel and vice president for administrative affairs, and
Dr. Rita Sussman, his wife and a psychologist in private practice,
are there to make sure things run smoothly and to provide a sense
of community.
   They live at the dorm year round with their daughter, Johanna,
15, a high school student, and two cats, J.R. and Patches. Their
son, Eric, 20, attends an out-of-state college and is home during
vacations.
   The apartment was not carved out until the early 1970s when the
school set up its resident master program, although the building
itself was designed by Mies van der Rohe in the late 1950s. By an
odd coincidence, Rita Sussman can recall eating on the same spot
when she was a graduate student and the space was part of the
dining hall.
   The apartment shows van der Rohe's modernism in its
floor-to-ceiling windows in an enormous living room. It's big
enough to seat 50 or so and accommodates both a grand piano and a
12-foot-long breakfront which once stood in one of the school's
libraries.
   The decorating problem the family faced is one which is likely
to be familiar to others who live with a mix of their own and
somebody else's furnishings.
   ``It was a challenge to blend our own furnishings with the ones
that were already there,'' says Mrs. Sussman. They brought with
them numerous art objects and paintings, books and memorabilia,
country-style American antiques and a few other pieces of
furniture. They purchased some tables and found on the premises
such useful furnishings as Oriental rugs, couches and tables.
   The Sussmans have two kitchens, including one used by students
to prepare occasional snacks and meals. They also have a large
dining room that's used frequently during the school year.
   When summer arrives and the students leave, the family finds
itself living in slightly eerie quiet. They mark the changes with
certain rituals. ``In June, I remove the extra leaves from the
dining room table. Then every September I put them back again,''
says Sussman.
   Family life in a college dormitory is a mixed blessing. While it
means never having to cook dinner and never having to worry about
running out of staples like coffee or milk during the school year,
it also means always having to get dressed before you open your
door. For Johanna Sussman, there's always somebody to talk to. For
the family's cats, it means having a regular visiting route and a
certain amount of notoriety. Their doings have occasionally been
subjects of discussion on the dorm's bulletin board.
   Being so much in the public eye also requires keeping a tidier
home. ``Most of our mess stays in the back rooms, but before
someone comes, there's usually that push to get things put away.
There are times when I would not do the dishes. If someone will be
coming, I wind up doing them,'' says Mrs. Sussman.
   More enjoyably, ``entertaining has ceased to hold terrors. I
remember the first occasions. Two weeks, one week, the day before:
I would wake up with anxiety in the pit of my stomach. Now I know
it will go well. Entertaining is just part of what I do.
   ``We used to be very private people. Our evenings are scheduled
more. There is frequently an activity, or we are on call or on the
phone. Our range and network have expanded considerably. I like
that,'' she says.
   Like other resident masters, who are usually senior college
professors, or the resident heads, who are often married graduate
students or teachers with children, the Sussmans receive free
lodging and board as well as a small stipend for their supervisory
role. They rent out the Chicago home they own and plan to reclaim
it when their open-ended tenure at Woodward Court is over. They
have a country home to go to when togetherness gets to be too much
of a good thing.
   When eventually they do return to their private lives, Rita
Sussman thinks she knows how she'll feel. ``I will miss the space
here. But there are places where you can have a lovely living room
and the wonderful space and light which we have here. Not living
with young people will be very hard. I am already missing in
anticipation their energy, enthusiasm and concern.''

   A frustrated shopper who can't find just the right fabric may
not agree, but the most important decorating trend today is freedom
of choice, say a number of home furnishings experts.
   Decorators, manufacturers and magazine editors are less likely
to dictate specific styles and more likely to ask people how they
live and what type of furnishings would be appealing and practical,
says Mary Gilliatt. ``There is more concern for how things work,''
adds the designer and author of books about decorating.
   ``Decorating styles are much more eclectic, more sophisticated,
and people seem bolder about mixing things. Not everything matches.
They are beginning to use more crafts. There are so many little
shops opening up that sell local things and seem to be doing quite
well,'' continues Gilliatt.
   The swing away from the decorator as dictator _ a star turn in
some arenas during the 1980s _ is powered by home furnishings
customers who are older, better educated and know what they want,
says John Young, president of Design America, a furniture
manufacturer in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Interest in interior design has been stimulated by a wider
acquaintance with art, according to Young, who points out that
``museum attendance has doubled seven times in the last decade.''
   This new savvy public is supporting a growing network of stores
in which handcrafted and well-designed factory-made objects are
shown together, says Bill Kraus, author of ``Contemporary Crafts
for the Home'' (Kraus Sikes, Inc., New York).
   Products once sold only through architects and designers are
available in these stores. ``The good things are more widely
available, though too much is still sold only through designers,''
says Gilliatt.
   She predicts that video will help to narrow the knowledge
gap.``We are a really visual society, and videos are the ideal
method of keeping consumers informed,'' she says.
   Video is an important potential medium of information and
learning about art, says Bronwyn Dunn, who has compiled a mail
order catalog of art appreciation videos.
   Prices for art videos are coming down. ``Once it cost up to $500
for a 16 mm print of an art appreciation program. Today videos of
the same material cost about $40,'' says Dunn. Her Greenwich,
Conn.-based company, Arts America, catalogs and distributes more
than 200 art videos. Recently, she says, a mail order customer in
Scottsdale, Ariz., spent $900 on cassettes, and another from
California sent in a $700 order.
   According to Bette Rosenberg, home fashions director for the
Spiegel catalog, people aren't just learning about art, they're
putting it in their homes. One of the most important decorating
trends is to use original art to give rooms a lift without having
to change furniture.
   Last year, Spiegel introduced its first specialty catalog
featuring original artworks and decorative art objects. The product
mix includes limited edition graphics, handicrafts, name brand
collectibles from makers such as Daum, Lladro, Waterford and Royal
Doulton, and signed oil paintings. Prices range from $80 to $2,500,
and the average amount spent is $200.
   ``We stress two points: art doesn't have to be expensive, and
collectibles don't have to be a name brand,'' she says.
   Still, those well-known designer names do appeal. Designer
collections with the taste and talents of a well-known master aimed
at the mass market can be looked at as a sign of the greater power
of the public, says designer Mario Buatta.
   Besides bringing the prices down, the designer collection makes
it easier to get a particular look exactly the way you want it and
so extends decorating choices. Recently, Buatta, whose name already
is on sheets, fabric, furniture and wallpaper, added needlepoint,
potpourri, table linens, decorative accessories, lamps and rugs to
his product line.
   Although the essence of the new decorating attitudes is that you
can have exactly what you want, even if it's vulgar excess, Buatta
does see a general trend toward restraint.
   ``People are using more classical decoration and adopting a
less-is-more attitude, after a period of ostentation, but still in
18th and 19th century terms,'' he says.
   Although some of his wealthy private clients are paring down,
the ornate look continues to appeal to the public, especially in
the bedroom, where Victorian-pattern sheets and lots of fabric
embellishments are more popular than ever.
   ``The quieter Victorian furniture pieces, such as Gothic revival
bed, have become popular with young people, partly because they are
affordable.''
   If, however, you find Victorian a gothic horror, skip it. The
decorating lesson of the day is this: If you don't like it, you
still can have what you like.

   Have you ever noticed that some chairs give
you confidence, while others make you feel inept? How some relax
you with cocoon-like comfort, but others put you on edge?
   Swedish chair designer Borge Lindau suggests that understanding
how a chair's form effects your physiology and frame of mind helps
you select seats that suit your purposes, for home or office.
   ``Pleasing proportions and color attract you, but other factors
figure into making a chair that `sits well.' Technically, the depth
and shape of the seat, the height and angle of legs, back and
armrests, as well as flexibility, texture and weight of the
materials from which it is made, give each chair a unique
psychology, an attitude that influences you,'' says Lindau.
   Innovative Scandinavian furniture designers, leading the way in
the ergonomics of chair-making, produce a wide range of
fabulous-looking, beautifully-crafted chairs that graciously
accommodate the human body and psyche.
   Dozens of Scandinavia's best chairs, including several by
Lindau, are displayed at NordForm90, an all-Scandinavian design
exhibition in Malmo through Sept. 2.
   ``We're showing chairs because we want people to be aware of the
amazing variety of options they have when selecting something to
sit on,'' says Lennart Lindquist, a NordForm90 organizer.
   NordForm90 spotlights 127 chairs from Denmark, Finland, Norway,
Sweden and Iceland. Armchairs, rockers, swivel, folding and
stackable chairs were selected because they exemplify Scandinavian
design principles and manufacturing skills.
   Models range from classic, sleek-lined 1930s armchairs by
Finland's Alvar Aalto to a futuristic prototype carbon fiber
armchair, strong as steel but weighing only 4 pounds, by Tuomo
Siitonen, also from Finland.
   Swedish design professor Olle Andersson says, ``Scandinavian
designers generally favor simple shapes and uncluttered lines,
neutral colors and natural materials used in technically
sophisticated ways. But despite overall similarities, each country
has its own design personality.''
   Finnish minimalism is exemplified by Harri Korhonen's armless
chair, a plump leather cube seat on two stainless steel tubes that
curve up the back and attach to a concave rectangular sheet of
stainless steel. It's supportive but allows the sitter to lean in
all directions.
   Sweden's creative updates of traditional styles include Matz
Theselius' armor-like armchair, an aluminum wraparound frame with
cushioned leather seat and back, and Ake Axelsson's throne-like
armchair with firm but flexible birchwood back and arm panels that
bend to each sitter's body.
   Borge Lindau's innovative ``Plank,'' a wooden board propped at a
60-degree angle with seat and headrest that adjust to fit sitters,
is casual and relaxing. ``Jazz,'' a swivel chair, has a tall,
rectangular, slightly rounded plywood back that acts as an
acoustical shield to catch and amplify sound.
   Torben Skov, from Denmark, experiments with balance points in
his elegant bentwood rocker and narrow-backed laminated wood seat
that's perched atop a curved metal rod and cross bar.
   Norwegian Peter Opsvik's anatomically corrective chairs place
sitters in semi-kneeling positions that improve their posture.
   Whether you choose to live with Scandinavian chairs or not, they
will convince you that you don't have to take uncomfortable chairs
sitting down.

   Far from making jokes about European plumbing
arrangements, Americans are now growing interested in fixtures from
overseas, according to the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Information
Bureau.
   One of the reasons is the design itself, says Linda Mayer, the
Kohler Co.'s marketing director. ``In good design, form follows
functions, and Europeans do a good job at both,'' she says.
European fixtures tend to be more rounded and come in interesting
shapes, some with Art Deco flavor.
   Thompson Price, a designer and president of the National Kitchen
&amp; Bath Association, says the European look uses rounded, gentle
curves which follow the contour of the body. ``Traditional American
fixture and faucet design tends to be more angular, with more
straight lines. Form follows function rather than aesthetics.''
   In recent years, major American fixture manufacturers have gone
into joint ventures with European companies to add some continental
finesse to their lines. Eljer, for example, has contracted with
Swedish, French and Italian groups, while Kohler Co. recently
acquired a French maker, Jacob Delafon. And the German firm, Ideal
Standard, is part of the American Standard corporate family.
   ``During the past several years, American manufacturers have
made great strides in adapting the `Eurostyle' look to domestic
bathroom products,'' says David L. Weiner, the PHCIC's executive
director. ``In turn, European manufacturers, particularly faucet
producers, have done a good job in cracking the American market.''
   The faucets have a soft, rounded look and often are colored.
Perhaps more importantly, they`re quieter. ``Europeans are very
sensitive to the noise made by their faucets,'' says Don Arnold, an
industry consultant. ``They have strict regulations on faucet
operating noise. American faucets would never pass these
regulations.''
   European makers are courting the U.S. customer. Joey Von Korff,
sales and marketing director for the Europe-based Villeroy &amp; Boch,
says that ``Americans are enthusiastic about our designs and
colors, and they appreciate our superior quality. Our plan is to
continue to build consumer awareness of our products.''
   But American firms still dominate the U.S. market, says Mayer.
``Fixtures are difficult to import, and they're priced higher than
domestic brands.''
   Major differences that may not translate well for the American
market are toilets and bidets. Scott Atcheson, Eljer's fixtures
product manager, points out that European toilets are not what
Americans are used to at home. ``European toilets are all super
water savers, using as little as 1.5 gallons per flush. Regulations
on water usage are stricter there than in the U.S.,'' he says.
``Although low-consumption toilets are now on the scene in this
country, the American consumer is still accustomed to a good strong
toilet flush.''
   And bidets in this country may be considered more a status
symbol than a necessity, adds Price. ``Europeans, on average, take
only about three baths per week as compared to seven or more for
Americans,'' he says. ``Europeans couldn't do without the bidet.''

   It is the room of many euphemisms: The powder room, cloakroom,
john or loo. Whatever you call it, the American bathroom has become
a status symbol, fueling a $12 billion-a-year business, according
to the National Kitchen and Bath Association.
   ``Quite a few of the bath layouts we show are larger than my
entire apartment,'' says Timothy Drew, editor of House Beautiful's
Kitchens and Baths editions. He observes that the numbers and kinds
of bathroom equipment have dramatically increased in the past few
years.
   ``People like baths that are romantic, comfortable, even exotic,
partly because they spend so much time there,'' says Scott Dee, who
with his wife Jan owns Studio Bath in Newport, Calif.
   Dee says that even one of his supplier's catalogs offers a pick
of more than 4,000 colors, finishes and styles in bathroom
fixtures. And there are over 100 kinds of shower heads. ``We can
install a series covering every part of the bather from head to
toe.''
   Engineering advances have reduced the familiar sound of a
dripping faucet, he adds; many designs have only one moving part.
   ``Bath design has become a highly specialized business,'' says
Dee. ``We work closely with consumers, architects and outside
designers to put together the proper fixtures, colors, spacings and
other aspects of the customized bath.''
   His biggest job so far has been a 500-square-foot master bath
with seven-foot carved glass shower and toilet-bidet doors, with a
six-foot double tub illuminated from beneath. The remodelling cost
$60,000.
   ``But a good designer can make a new or remodeled bath
affordable for just about any budget,'' he says.
   Interior designer Susan Pope thinks remodeling costs are good
investments, especially when the house is re-sold, ``simply because
the bath is one of the two or three key areas that catch a person's
eye immediately.''
   Pope, who consults with a stained glass overlay maker, says such
overlays on windows and skylights are being used for privacy as
well as to improve design. Other trends include black, mauve and
teal fixtures. ``The California look is now combined with European
designs, emphasizing clean lines and hidden hardware,'' she says.
   Elegant touches noted by Dee are faucets set in semi-precious
stones and overlaid with gold or silver. But he says one of the
best changes will benefit all those people who have had to scrunch
down over the basin to shave: designers, he says, have finally
raised counters four to six inches to accommodate taller people.

   Among floor coverings, the Oriental rug is the
classic, and it can last indefinitely if properly cared for.
   Tom Jorjorian, manager of the Nahigian Brothers cleaning plant,
says an Oriental rug can last ``forever.'' He offers these tips to
owners:
   _ Turn your rugs every year to equalize traffic wear and light
exposure.
   _ Be sure the rug has padding to reduce wear and inhibit
slippage. Pads also add ``sumptuousness,'' he says.
   _ Vaccuum the rugs in the direction of the nap, which you can
determine by running your hand over the surface.
   _ Sweep fringes with a broom instead of vacuuming, which can
break them.
   _ Do not beat your rug. That can break the foundation.
   _ Broom sweeping not only removes loose dirt but helps bring out
the wool's natural sheen.
   _ Never put a house plant or flower pot on the rug. No matter
how careful you are, moisture can penetrate or condense on the rug,
creating permanent mildew damage.
   _ Mop up spills by blotting, not rubbing. Dilute the spillage
with plenty of cool water and continue blotting until the rug
appears to be clean. Try not to soak unaffected parts. Dry
thoroughly, first using absorbent towels on top and underneath,
then turning the rug over to dry the foundation. Finally, turn it
upright to finish drying.
   _ If spills have dried, get the advice of an experienced rug
cleaner.
   _ Don't use steam cleaners or chemicals. These can prematurely
age the rug by removing the wool's natural oils.
   _ Inspect your rug every few months, looking for wear at the
edges and ends. Check the back for moth damage, which will appear
as areas of missing knots, even though the cotton foundation
remains.
   _ Store Oriental rugs not in use where they will be safe from
excess humidity, heat and moths. Have them mothproof-sprayed by a
professional or pack them with moth crystals if they are to be
stored for any length of time.
   _ Roll, do not fold, for storage.
   _ Be wary of over-the-counter stain removers. They may not be
right for your kind of rug and may cause permanent damage.
   Nahigian Brothers maintains a hotline 1 (800) 543-7888, to
answer consumer information about Oriental rug care. The company is
part of the Torcom Group, a conglomerate of Oriental rug retail,
manufacturing and service establishments.

   There may be more life in old carpeting than you suspect,
whether it's what you've had for years or something you inherited
from the previous owner when you bought a home.
   ``Don't count carpet that is down as necessarily out,'' says
Shannon Rench Tyler Of Racine Industries, which makes a carpet
dry-cleaning system called Host. She advises trying to restore
carpet by deep cleaning to bring it back to life.
   ``Make cleaning the carpet the first step before moving into a
new home,'' she says. ``If you start by bringing out the carpet's
true color, that can set up the color scheme for wall finishes and
furnishings.''
   Once you've moved in, she advises, concentrate on high-traffic
areas and spills, spot-cleaning where necessary. ``Leave furniture
in place and dry clean around it where the carpet is soiled. Blend
cleaned areas into surrounding clean carpet and maintain the rest
of the carpet with vacuuming.''
   And to prevent stains from setting, clean up spots and spills
immediately. If it's a wet spill, blot it with clean paper or cloth
toweling, standing on it to speed absorption. Pet spots should be
blotted up with a half-and-half mixture of white vinegar and water.
   For more detailed instructions about removing a variety of
substances from carpeting, the company offers a free booklet,
``Carpet Care Made Easy.'' Call (800) 558-9439, or in Wisconsin,
(800) 242-2023.
    _
   Choosing carpet for your home is subjective when it comes to
design, color, or texture. But knowing some basics about carpet
will help you make a good buy.
   Du Pont, which makes fibers used in carpeting (including
Stainmaster, which widens choices by being less liable to
discolor), outlines some things to watch for when you're at the
carpet store:
   _ Be practical about color. Lighter, more delicate shades are
appropriate to bedrooms that get less traffic. But for
heavy-traffic areas, such as a playroom, choose a darker, richer
shade.
   _ Look at a large sample. Color seems to intensify in larger
spaces. Take samples home to look at in the room to be carpeted,
noting their appearance in both daylight and lamplight.
   _ Check the density of carpet by pressing it with your fingers
to see how hard it is to penetrate to the backing. Or give it the
``grin'' test by bending back a corner to see how much of the
backing shows through. Less visible backing means heavier, sturdier
pile.
   _ Check the yarn twist. The tips of the fibers should be neat,
tight and cleanly sheared. The tighter the twist (meaning the
fibers won't fray), the better the carpet will stand up to daily
traffic and cleaning. Ask if the yarn has been heat set; heat
setting locks the twist into place permanently.
   _ Consider the texture. Most carpets begin with a loop pile,
then are varied by cutting (or not cutting) the pile. Uncut loops
equal in height offer a tight, pebbly surface that will withstand
heavy traffic and hide footprints and furniture marks. Dirt tends
to stay on the surface of level-loop pile, making cleaning easier
in halls, stairways, children's and family rooms. Cut-pile carpets,
which Du Pont says accounts for a majority of carpet purchases,
have the top loop sheared off, creating a luxurious texture. These
wear well, hiding footprints, soil and dust. Carpets with saxony
textures _ made from yarns which have high twist levels _ are a
good choice when you want a formal, luxurious look. They're
especially appropriate for dining and living rooms and master
bedrooms.
   _ Choose the right fiber. Nylon is used in about 85 percent of
all residential installations, according to Du Pont. It has good
maintenance and performance characteristics, and a wide selection
of color and style is available a reasonable cost. Wool, the oldest
type of carpet, is considered more luxurious and is more expensive,
but it may not hold up well under heavy household traffic. Other
carpet fibers include polyester, which is probably less durable
than nylon but feels soft to the touch, and polypropylene, used
mainly in indoor-outdoor carpeting.
   For detailed information about carpet selection, the company
offers the ``Complete Book of Carpeting'' without charge. Write to

   The easiest and most affordable way to redecorate is the softest
_ with fabrics and carpeting.
   That means curtains, bed linens, table linens, wallcoverings,
rugs, carpets, and those old standbys, slipcovers and decorator
pillows.
   Teflon, often associated with pots and presidents, now is
protecting fabrics from soil and stains. The Du Pont process is
being used by makers of fabrics who supply both furniture
manufacturers and home decorators.
   Among these are Waverly's classics in its New Traditions II line
_ the Jacobean ``Marlborough'' with an accompanying allover floral
``Montchanin,'' or the leafy ``Malvern'' and the coordinating
stripe ``Kennett.'' Bloomcraft has a collection of designs inspired
by fabrics and wallcoverings from the Louvre _ a medallion floral
accompanied by a Chinoiserie stripe, an allover floral, and a vine
and scrolled mini, all in a brilliant lacquer red. Anju Woodridge
offers a large Indian-motif medallion, ``Morgan,'' and its
coordinating stripe, ``MonteCristo.''
   Shower curtains that have been Teflon-treated are being given
full-scale decorator treatments with balloon and swag valances,
embroidery, ruffles, appliques, pleats and borders. The departure
from ordinary ring-and-hang curtains may owe to the characteristics
of the treated fabrics, which repel soapy water, spilled shampoos
and lotions, and discourage mildew. Many of the fabric designs are
matched with those used in the bedroom, and accessories such as
sink skirts, window curtains, towels, lid covers and rugs can be
coordinated. Floral prints against black backgrounds, animal-skin
patterns, and paisleys are being used to form a richer palette than
that used in traditional bathrooms and bedrooms.
   The unified bed-and-bath concept is exemplified in the newest
Bill Blass for Springmaid collection. Five new patterns by the
designer _ ``Castleton,'' ``Petit Point Stripe,'' ``Stanhope,''
``Montgomery'' and ``Riande'' _ are being marketed in sheets,
comforters, bedskirts, shams, spreads, draperies, decorative
pillows, towels and shower curtains. According to Springmaid, this
collection celebrates the 20th anniversary of its collaboration
with Blass, who was the first ``name'' designer to branch out into
home furnishings lines.
   The ensemble approach also applies to Springmaid's designs by
Lynn Hollyn, a designer whose European country look coordinates but
does not exactly match. The Lynn Hollyn at Home Collection features
rugs from Masterlooms in the designer's muted pallette that
coordinates with the bedlinen line and throws from The Three
Weavers. These area rugs are her versions of classic patterns _
``Oxford Quarters,'' ``Secret Garden,'' and ``Swedish Hearth,''
among them.
   Bordering and inset designs in wall-to-wall carpeting are part
of a new trend toward using the floor as a distinct architectural
element. Lighter colors can be used with more frequency since much
carpeting is now treated, like the fabrics, to resist stains and
dirt. Combined styles for custom-design looks might include
medallions, area stripes, borders, and other designs. Many of these
will be found with Du Pont's Stainmaster label.
   For a final soft touch, the home decorator can have designer
needlepoint pillows. Mario Buatta, known for his mastery of English
country design, has teamed with Thimbelina, the makers of
needlepoint designs and products, for his interpretations of
traditional motifs _ King Charles Spaniels, cabbage roses and
fruits, available in kits or finished pillows.

   An illusory library. Marble looks. Decorators always have been
able to achieve special effects _ at decorators' prices.
   Now these effects can be achieved through wallcoverings, in Mary
Gilliatt's Faux Finish Background and Borders, a collection
cooperatively produced by the British interior designer and writer
and Sandpiper Studios.
   ``The `90s will be a period of rich decoration, ornamentation,
opulence and fine detail. Faux finishes and trompe l'oeil are
lovely techniques that have moved out of the magazines into
people's homes,'' says Gilliatt.
   One of the trompe l'oeil (``fool the eye'') wallpapers looks
like a classical library with leather-bound books. The faux
finishes also emulate marble and other textures.
   ``Although many people have become adept at creating painted
faux finishes on their walls _ such as marbleizing, rag rolling or
sponging _ for most, achieving professional results is beyond their
time or abilities,'' says Richard Felber, who heads Sandpiper. The
new wallpapers make it possible to achieve the same effect with
ease and affordability, he says.
   Other trends noted by Felber are pattern mixes and inspirational
themes, both covered in his company's collections. Victorian-style
stripes intertwined with flowers, paisleys and damasks feature in
the Camden Passage collection. ``The more-is-more look is here to
stay, be it with Victoriana, English Country or Old European
looks.''
   Sandpiper's Bless This House collection includes papers that
have borders with Biblical quotations and other messages of love
and friendship, incorporated in traditional designs. _

   To connoisseurs, elegant lead crystal means Ireland, where
mouth-blown, full-lead pieces have been made for centuries.
   Irish crystal does come dear, but a relatively young Irish
company, Tipperary Crystal, offers a line that equals the quality
of the famous Waterford but sells for about 30 percent less.
   According to Bernadette Ryan, who owns the Grafton Shoppe in New
York City and the Irish Shoppe in Block Island, R.I., the crystal
is one of the best-selling lines at these two Irish crafts stores.
   ``My customers buy it for special occasions, especially for
weddings and anniversaries,'' she says. It also is much more
readily available than Waterford, she adds. Many of the pieces are
engraved, either with initials or with dedications for special
events, ``a nice alternative to silver.''
   Tipperary might be considered a lineal descendent of Waterford,
since it is run by a group of former Waterford craftsmen who formed
the new company in the wake of Waterford's restructuring a little
over two years ago. A leader of the group, Joseph Foley, was a
24-year Waterford veteran who took advantage of a restructuring
buyout option and found a backing partner to start the company. The
group makes crystal the traditional way by mouth-blowing, then
hand-cutting each individual piece. The lead content is over 33
percent, which gives the crystal strength, durability and imparts a
slight bluish color. Cutting serves the same function as faceting
in gems, adding sparkle and iridescence.
   Traditional suites, or patterns, are named after landmarks near
the company's cottage factory in Ballynoran, County Tipperary:
``Carrick,'' after the historic village; ``Slievenamon,'' named for
the legendary mountain; and ``Dovehill,'' a Norman castle once
commanded by Connet O'Moore, a 14th century Irish chieftain.
   Ryan says one of the most attractive ways to display crystal is
to mix patterns. And: ``Use it every day. It's meant to be
enjoyed.''
   The combination of quality and price (a water goblet will sell
for about $40, a wineglass for $33) has made it popular with
Americans, who make up much of its market, according to the
company. American sales have helped the company nearly quadruple
its staff.
   The crystal, imported through Kraftware@Morgan in New York, is
sold at Irish and other specialty shops around the country as well
as through the P.J. Carroll catalog _ 1 (800) 255-3933.

   A real wine cellar, with temperature and humidity controls to
protect quantities of precious vintages, is something that's beyond
most people who live in average apartments and houses.
   But Palace Brands Company, which imports wines, says anyone can
create a small ``cellar'' in a closet.
   Choose a closet used for off-season storage, because the
temperature will remain constant and cooler than one opened every
day. Reserve about two square feet of floor space, add a wine rack,
and collect a cellarage of 12 to 24 bottles. The closet clutter _
clothes, sports equipment, or whatever _ will help maintain a good
climate for the wine storage, away from light, heat, and excessive
vibration.
   You can collect a respectable cellar for about $5 to $10 a
bottle, the company says. Whether you prefer white or red, it
recommends you keep some of ``the other kind'' to go with dishes
that demand that type (or for guests who prefer it). Some white
suggestions: Anselmi Soave from Northern Italy, Ladoucette
Sauvignon de Sauvignon from the Loire Valley of France, or Casal
Thaulero's Trebbiano from Italy's Abruzzo region. Reds: Bouchard
Pere &amp; Fils Beaujolais or Mouton-Cadet Bordeaux, both from France,
or Rubesco from Lungarotti in Italy.

   The collectibles you move in with may contribute as much to the
decor as the paint, wallpaper, rugs and drapes. Pictures, boxes, or
objets d'art may capture the eye first and determine a room's
character.
   Frames evoking classic styles like Victorian ceramics, Parisian
silver, or sculptured Italian or Russian designs in a variety of
metals that have been burnished, painted, or mirrored are offered
by Dakin Terragrafics. ``Not only have picture frames regained
their elegance, evoking a time when photos of family members were a
novelty and placed in intricately crafted silver casings, they have
recently inspired a veritable explosion of new designs and
materials,'' says Joseph E. Walsmith, the firm's president.
   Fabric styles that are similar to English chintz designs, by I
Was Framed, cover picture frames and are available with matching
boxes for jewelry, hats, cosmetics, dishes, and other collectibles,
as well as tissue dispensers, wastebaskets, albums, notebooks,
music boxes and similar items. Most of the designs are florals, but
the line also includes moires in pink or black.
   Gallery and Art Nouveau styles, including a number of
architecturally inspired frames based on the work of Scottish
designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, are offered through the
Exposures catalog. Also available are archival storage and display
systems for incurable collectors of photos and oddments, including
glass-covered cases and museum-style tables in which to display
favorite baubles. For information or catalogs, call 1 (800)
222-4947.
   From Diane Von Furstenberg come frames, desk accessories and
paper tableware in bold animal prints. Her Nairobi collection
features abstracts of leopard, tiger and zebra patterns on picture
frames, address books, journals, albums, letter holders,
stationery, paper plates, napkins and invitations.

   All new cabinets and countertops, additional work islands,
walk-in pantries and all new appliances top the kitchen wish-lists
of the readers of 1001 Home Ideas Magazine.
   The publication and the Association of Home Appliance
Manufacturers surveyed readers to find out what they'd like in
their dream kitchens. Of the 1,700 responses, many picked major
structural changes to ease storage problems and streamline kitchen
chores. All new cabinets and countertops were desired by 65
percent, and walk-in pantries and work islands each polled 51
percent. Next came appliances, with 48 percent.
   Only 15 percent wanted home offices installed in kitchen areas,
a result which surprised the surveyors. Other preferences were for
greenhouse windows (33 percent), skylights (26 percent) sit-down
conversation areas (18 percent), and fireplaces (8 percent).
   Said a reader in Oden, Texas: ``Our home is 20 years old and so
are our appliances. I don't really need beautiful new appliances.
Mine are working fine. But it's a lovely dream.'' _
   Designer appliances?
   Caloric's consumer research turned up a wish for designer
ranges, and so it's offering five Ultra-Tech designer models in its
new high-end Prestige line of gas and electric ranges, using an
eclectic black and white color scheme.
   Oster has brought out a Designer Collection, a complete line of
appliances in soft white with teal and gray accents, with key items
also available in black.
   And Jenn-Air's Designer Line White opts for an all-over white
scheme, with soft rose accents and subtle gray striping.
   Oster's redesign includes the company's flagship product, the
Oster Kitchen Center appliance, a single-motor stand powering a
mixer, a doughmaker, a slicer-shredder, a food processor, and a
blender.
   ``Consumers are looking for quality products that will last. But
image is important, too,'' says Mary Hanneman, Oster's director of
home economics. ``They want their kitchen to look as coordinated as
the rest of their home.''
   The Caloric ranges feature basic white with black trim. They
have white main tops, sides and storage drawers and black glass
oven doors. Free-standing units also have black glass backguards
framed with black trim. Gas models have black porcelain sealed
burners and porcelainized black cast iron burner grates. Electric
models have black reflector bowls under plug-in open coil elements.
   James Paullin, Caloric's vice president of marketing and sales,
says the company noticed that quite a few people raised the
question of designer ranges in consumer surveys. ``While this was
not a majority opinion, we heard this question often enough in
different cities that we decided to commit ourselves to a series of
such designer models.''
   The Jenn-Air line includes the Selective-Use Oven, a double wall
oven unit which offers a choice of four cooking methods:
microwaving, convection baking, radiant (conventional) baking, or
broiling. The line also includes a a choice of cooktops (one which
sits flush with cabinets), a free-standing microwave, and a
dishwasher. Oven doors are white glass, and its 30-inch cooktop has
solid elements sealed into a white tempered glass surface. _
   In a nod to the designer movement, the AGA Cooker also comes in
a choice of vitreous enamel finishes: red, black, cream, white,
brown, blue and green.
   But the stove's main sales point (aside from its fame as a
status symbol for upper-class Britons) is its operation based on
stored heat, with no dials or knobs to regulate temperatures. The
stove has four ovens (for roasting, baking, simmering and warming)
and three surface plates (for boiling, simmering and warming). All
seven, plus grilling and broiling, can be active at the same time.
It's perfect for those who want a stove in classic design that will
cook superbly but not require constant attention, says Phil Tonks,
AGA's general manager in this country. ``The AGA has great
potential in the U.S., where quality is demanded but time is
limited. In addition, using the slow-cooking ovens, meals can be
prepared in the morning, simmered all day, yet be perfect at dinner
time. The even radiant heat minimizes shrinkage, seals in juices,
retains nutrients and enhances the flavors.'' _
   The Cold Front, a lightweight air conditioner-dehumidifier on
rollers that can be moved from room to room and requires no window
or through-the-wall installation, is new from Bionaire Corporation.
   The unit runs on normal house electricity, drawing only seven
amps of current. The company says it's good for cooling apartments,
boats, mobile homes, porches and decks. They also recommend it for
economical use when only one room in a house needs cooling, saving
the expense of operating a central air conditioning system. It
delivers 5500 BTUs and an airflow output of 162 cubic feet per
minute. It dehumidifies at the rate of 1.3 pints per hour. _
   Information to help you select the right appliance is available
from the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. ``1990
Consumer Selection Guide for Room Air Conditioners,'' and ``1990
Consumer Selection Guide for Refrigerators and Freezers'' are $1.50
each (to cover postage and handling) from AHAM's Communications
Department, 20 North Wacker Drive, Chicago, Ill. 60606. Each guide
has a list by model and brand, noting energy cost and efficiency
and offers instructions on how to estimate your requirements. _
   Bissell calls its new SC Deep Cleaning Machine the most advanced
carpet cleaner in its line, with a power pump and two-gallon
reservoir. The machine flushes cleaning formula and warm water
through the carpet or upholstery, then pulls the dirt and liquid
back out by suction. It has nozzles for cleaning carpet and
upholstery, a bare floor attachment and a storage rack. The cleaner
will be in stores by October. _

   Mural artists Erni Vales and Gil Aviles started
their careers on the fast track, their early work appearing on New
York city subways, trains and walls.
   Vales and Aviles are retired graffiti artists, gone legitimate.
Now, as ErniGil, inc., they design and paint original murals for
business and residential clients.
   The murals show the bold stroke and color techniques they
sharpened as teen-agers, when they sneaked out of their bedrooms at
night to paint subway cars. Now the work is far more polished, with
cartoon characters, pop culture icons, abstracts and ethnic designs.
   ``At first you couldn't talk to us about anything but
graffiti,'' says Vales. ``Then we began to learn about art history
and technique,'' adds Aviles. ``We learned marbleizing, tromp
l'oeil devices, and the range of materials including spray can,
paintbrush and airbrush.''
   Both graduated from the High School of Art &amp; Design in New York;
Aviles also is a graduate of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. They
formed their partnership in l987 and since have done work for
trendy nightclubs and restaurants, such as New York's Tunnel, China
Club and Bedrox and Chicago's The Bridge. They've done window
displays for the Charles Jourdan shoe salon in New York and
backdrops for ABC-TV's ``Knightwatch,'' and PBS-TV's ``Rock
School.'' They've also taken private commissions for homes.
   ``We'll never deny where we've come from,'' says Vales. Indeed,
their company logo shows a sketch of the front of a subway car.

   You can let you children have a free hand in decorating their
own rooms (without creating havoc) with Decorate-It! kits,
featuring themed appliques that stick on walls the same way as
Post-it notes. Themes include Fun For All, which coordinates with
By The Dream Machine accessories; The Lost West, with dinosaurs and
cowpokes; The Voo Zoo, a magical menagerie; Hares &amp; Bears, with
teddy bears and bunnies floating on puffy clouds; Prairie Tales,
visual puns with desert animals; and Sea-nanigans, featuring the
educated dolphin Miss Quote, an in-depth teacher at the School of
Fish. _
   If you like real English dinnerware but aren't financially ready
to move up to expensive china or earthenware, you may find budget
ironstone dinnerware from Kane Industries an affordable
alternative. Made in Stoke-on-Trent, the capital of the English
Potteries district, the line comes in traditional country scenic,
floral and willow patterns. Prices range from between $35 and $50
for 20-piece sets. They're available at food, discount, drug and
specialty stores. _
   Aluminum outdoor furniture from Tropitone's Focus collection
echoes the curves of bentwood in its chairs, chaises and tables.
Sleek triple-tube construction of powdered, rust-free aluminum is
paired with either European or modified cartridge cushions in the
designs: Hibiscus, Jacaranda, and Mariposa. This family of designs
can be mixed. Mariposa uses a classic inverted ``U'' design, while
Jacaranda has a two-thirds crescent shape mounted on sled-like
runners. Hibiscus is more angular, with rectangular side panels
that frame decorative sweeps. Tabletops are offered in either
acrylite or tempered glass. _
   A decorative window pouf can be quickly made with just a scrap
of fabric using Kirsch's new Tulip Swagholder. Simple hemmed panels
also can be formed into rosettes, bows, hearts, shells and other
forms, then used singly or in groups and with rods or poles to
create window treatments with a minimum of fabric. They can be
mounted inside or outside window frames, on walls or even the
ceiling. The hardware comes with instructions for creating
different looks; Kirsch says anyone who can tie a bow can master
the Swagholder. _
   Beautiful crystal is literally back off the shelf these days.
   ``Suddenly, we're discovering that even a glass of tap water
tastes better in crystal,'' says interior designer Marshall Watson,
who observes that many people like to show off their crystal
barware and decanters on silver platters. Barware in particular has
enjoyed a revival of popularity, according to Carolyn Ingham of
Cien, a company that makes hand-cut crystal. What's more, she says,
people like to use it every day. ``People today don't want their
crystal to sit in cabinets while they hope for the Queen Mother to
drop by.'' _
   Waterbeds, a novelty in the 1960s, are becoming mainstream
products, says the president of the Waterbed Manufacters
Association, Michael Geraghty. One type that is catching on, he
says, is a soft-sided waterbed mattress that resembles a
conventional one and will fit standard beds and bedlinens the
consumer may already own. ``This is important to consumers
concerned about purchasing odd bedroom furniture pieces,'' says
Geraghty.

   Traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange whooped when
the nation's best-known stock barometer, which has flirted with

that should help the carrier show an operating profit in 1991.
   Eastern lost $852.3 million last year. Shugrue said the company

   Widely available computers, printers and

   Scores of East German factories agreed to
raise wages and preserve jobs for 350,000 metalworkers but said the
labor contract may actually speed the collapse of some plants.
   The one-year pact was reached Friday after a series of strikes
by hundreds of thousands of metalworkers around Berlin. It is the
biggest labor agreement since East Germany became a free market on

<HEAD>No. 1 Jewelry Retailer to Stop Selling South African Gold</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's largest jewelry chain, Ratners PLC, said
Monday that it will stop selling jewelry made with South African
gold after anti-apartheid groups picketed its stores.
   At least one of the groups, End Loans to South Africa, said it
has suspended its action against Ratners and has asked others to do
the same, pending a meeting with Ratners officials in the next few
days.
   Ratners, which earlier this month made a friendly $328 million
offer to acquire U.S. jewelry retailer Kay Jewelers Inc., said its
decision to stop using South African gold was part of a continuing
switch to North American gold supplies.
   South African gold is found in as much as 3 percent of its gold
jewelry, Ratners said. It had total sales of $1.6 billion in its
fiscal year ended Feb. 3.
   ``It's a fairly simple process for us to remove the final few
percentage points,'' said a Ratners spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The process should be completed in the next
year or two, he said.
   The spokesman denied that the move was in reponse to
anti-apartheid pressure. He said he believed only three of its more
than 1,000 British stores were picketed.
   ``We're a commercial organization, not a political
organization,'' he said.
   End Loans to South Africa said it and other groups had applied
pressure on Ratners in response to African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela's call to intensify sanctions and boycott South
African goods to end apartheid.
   The ANC is South Africa's leading black opposition movement. It
is seeking to end white minority rule of South Africa's black
majority.
   Ratners has purchased much of its gold jewelry supplies from
Italy, which according to a U.S. General Accounting Office report
gets 91 percent of its gold fom South Africa, the group said.
   South Africa produces one-third of the world's gold, the group
said. South African supplies dominate the European gold market and
almost all gold jewelry sold in Britain is made with South African
gold, the group said.
   Non-South African supplies of gold are plentiful, it said.
   ``This historic victory will send clear signals to South Africa
and will hasten an early end to apartheid,'' said Cosmas Desmond,
head of End Loans to South Africa. ``It shows that British business
can no longer avoid the moral implications of collaborating with
apartheid.''

<TEXT>
   French busiessman Bernard Tapie disclosed Monday
that he will pay $290 million for an 80 percent stake in the West
German manufacturer Addidas AG and receive financing from eight
French, German and Japanese banks.
   Tapie, a soccer team owner and Socialist member of Parliament,
had announced plans to take over the sportings goods company July 7
in Rome, the day before the finals of the World Cup. But he had
refused to disclose details of the transaction.
   Some industry observers questioned where Tapie would obtain the
necessary financing. The value of his purchase from the Dassler
family was estimated in the German press to be as much as $540
million, but Tapie told reporters he had obtained a bargain price.
   Adidas has been losing market share in recent years to strong
U.S. competitors such as Nike Inc. and Reebok International Inc.
   Its total worldwide sales and licensing revenues are about $2.8
billion a year.
   Tapie said the financing of the purchase would be backed by the
Bank of Toyko and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan, by Bayerische
Vereinsbank and Hypobank of West Germany, and by four French banks
_ Credit Lyonnais, Phenix, Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit
Agricole.
   Tapie did not specify the financial roles to be played by each
bank.

   The stock market hovered around last week's
closing levels today as traders studied a mixed array of corporate
earnings reports.
   The 10 a.m. Dow Jones average of 30 industrials stood at
2,980.20, unchanged from Friday's record close.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 588 up, 404
down and 485 unchanged.
   Volue on the Big Board came to 20.43 million shares after the
first half hour of the session.
   Analysts said traders seemed reluctant to start any immediate
new assault on the 3,000 level in the Dow Jones industrial average,
which was reached for the first time briefly in Friday's session.
   Instead, it appeared that stocks were left to respond
individually to any surprises, favorable or unfavorable, that come
along in earnings reports for the second quarter of the year.
   International Business Machines stirred up some enthusiasm when
it posted second-quarter profits of $2.45 a share, up from $2.31 in
the like period last year. IBM shares gained } to 121}.
   However, investors also were confronted with adverse news from
Chase Manhattan Corp. The New York bank holding company's quarterly
earnings slumped to 24 cents from $1.31 in the second quarter last
year.
   Chase stock dropped \ to 21.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .06 to 200.39. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .41 at 364.40.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,980.20,
for a net gain of 10.40 points on the day and a 75.25-point rise
for the week.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today dramatically
boosted its official estimate of the fiscal 1991 budget deficit to
$168.8 billion, two-thirds higher than its forecast just six months
ago.
   The increase could force automatic spending cuts of over $100
billion if Congress and the administration don't agree on a package
of spending reductions and tax increases.
   Today's estimate did not even include the costs of bailing out
the savings and loan industry. When those costs are included, the
deficit for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 climbs to $231.4
billion, the White House said in its official mid-session review of
the budget.
   The administration's new forecast is far higher than the $100.5
billion deficit estimate included in the president's budget when it
was released last January.
   It is also significantly higher than the $64 billion deficit
target set by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.
   If Congress is unable to reduce the deficit to within $10
billion of the $64 billion, it triggers across-the-board spending
cuts.
   Along with its new deficit estimate, the administration included
dire warnings of what could happen if the current budget
negotiations between Congress and the administration fail and the
across-the-board cuts are triggered.
   White House Budget Director Richard Darman called
across-the-board cuts of more than $100 billion unprecedented in
their magnitude and ``highly disruptive'' to a host of government
programs.
   Darman said such a reduction would require a 38.4 percent in
non-defense spending and cuts of between 25.1 percent and 43.3
percent in military programs. Social Security and some other
entitlement programs are exempt from Gramm-Rudman cuts, forcing
even sharper reductions in other programs.
   Darman said that the Gramm-Rudman cuts would force major
cutbacks in air traffic control operations, increasing delays for
air passengers by 400 percent to 600 percent. The cuts would also
require a 40 percent cut in the Head Start program affecting
200,000 4-year-olds and sharply curtailing other government
programs ranging from poultry and meat inspections to cleanup of
Superfund toxic waste sites.
   ``If the summit negotiation fails these effects are exactly what
we will face in the fall,'' Darman told a crowded news conference.
   The administration's new estimates make it highly likely that
the Gramm-Rudman law will have to be at least modified, given the
size of the savings needs to reach a $64 billion target. Both the
administration and Congress have been discussing spending cuts and
tax increases in a range of between $50 billion and $60 billion,
about half of what would be needed with the new estimates.
   By emphasizing a deficit figure that did not include the savings
and loan bailout, the administration seemed to be laying the
groundwork for removing this giant expenditure from the
Gramm-Rudman calculations, something that many members of Congress
have also proposed.
   The administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit
from January until now on the higher-than-expected S&amp;L bailout and
weaker economic growth, which cuts into government revenues, and
higher interest rates, which raise the cost to the government of
paying for the $3 trillion national debt.
   The administration actually included three deficit estimates in
its mid-term review. In addition to the $231.4 billion with the S&amp;L
bailout included and the $168.8 billion excluding S&amp;Ls, the
administration cited an even lower $148.4 billion deficit which
excluded food stamp costs because the program technically expires
this year.
   The mid-session budget review lowered projected economic growth
from 2.6 percent down to 2.2 percent, more in line with what
private forecasters are predicting.
   It projected a 4.8 percent rise in consumer prices this year,
matching last year's inflation increase, but up from the
administration's estimate of a lower inflation figure of 4.4
percent.
   It raised the government's cost of borrowing short-term by a
full percentage point to 7.7 percent.
   ``The January budget had assumed that interest rates would start
to decline steadily this year. Instead, rates rose through early
spring,'' the report noted. ``The mid-session review assumes
interest rates will remain around current levels during the second
half of this year and then move progressively lower during the
following five years as inflation and the federal deficit are
reduced.''
   Both Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Michael Boskin,
chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said that
the administration's interest rate forecast depended on the Federal
Reserve easing up on its tight-credit stance.
   While such administration entreaties have failed in the past,
the Fed did take a small step last week to a looser monetary
policy, following growing signs of a weakening economy.
   When President Bush sent Congress his 1991 budget on Jan. 29, he
predicted a deficit of $100.5 billion _ absent any changes in
government policy _ for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
   To reduce that figure to the $64 billion required by the
Gramm-Rudman law, Bush called for $36 billion in spending cuts and
modest tax increases, far lower than the more than $100 billion in
cuts now being estimated.
   The administration must make its official estimate of
Gramm-Rudman cuts on Aug. 25 and then the cuts become final when
the fiscal year begins in October.
   Bush has said the change in estimates was a major factor
influencing his decision last month to reverse his stand against
tax increases.
   While economists were widely skeptical of the January economic
assumptions used by the administration, the July update was likely
to bring more agreement.
   Roger Brinner, senior economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic
forecasting firm, said he believes the 1991 budget deficit will top
$188 billion. He said that assumes the current budget negotiators
will be able to arrive at a tax and spending package that will
reduce the deficit by $38 billion.
   Michael Evans, head of a private forecasting firm, was even more
pessimistic, predicting that the 1991 deficit will hit $230
billion. He said the deficit in the current fiscal year was
expected to total $205 billion, compared to an actual deficit of
$152 billion in the last fiscal year.

   An anti-baldness drug isn't the only way
Upjohn Co. is promoting fuller scalps. The pharmaceutical giant is
ending a four-decade tradition this year by eliminating staff
barber shops.
   Giving a new meaning to corporate cost-clipping, Upjohn said the
barber shops at its main manufacturing plant and Kalamazoo
corporate headquarters will close by Dec. 31 as part of a
company-wide effort to reduce expenses.
   Upjohn has offered employees subsidized haircuts since 1951. A
basic cut costs $8.
   In recent years, the shops were providing about 14,000 haircuts
annually to male and female employees and retirees, Upjohn
spokesman Robert McDonough said. The two shops employ five hair
stylists.
   Upjohn is the manufacturer of a hair-growing product known as
Rogaine, sold by prescription for men in more than 60 countries
including the United States. It has been shown to grow hair in
about 39 percent of young men in the early stages of baldness.

   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. on Monday reported a 16.4
percent increase in its second quarter profit, boosted by 7.8
percent growth in revenue.
   The chemical and diversified industrial company said improved
results at several of its divisions contributed to the good overall
results and will strengthen the company's future financial
performance.
   Grace earned $51.29 million, or 60 cents a share, in the three
months ended June 30, up from $44.07 million, or 52 cents a share,
a year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.63 billion from $1.51 billion.
   For the first half of this year, Grace's earnings amounted to
$83.90 million, or 98 cents a share, up 14.2 percent from $73.48
million, or 88 cents a share, in the first six months of 1989.
Half-year revenue grew 7.8 percent to $3.14 billion from $2.91
billion in 1989.
   The largest operating unit of the company, Grace Specialty
Chemicals Co., posted a 10 percent after-tax gain in operating
income, helped by advances in its packaging operations business and
higher sales of high-speed drying equipment used by the printing
industry.
   But Grace's energy business had a sharp drop in its operating
income due largely to the bankruptcy of a long-term customer of a
coal company in which Grace has a 50 percent interest.
   Commenting on the quarterly results, Chairman and Chief
Executive J. Peter Grace said: ``There were improvements in several
sectors of our businesses that will help further strengthen our
results in the future.''
   Grace, based in New York, is a major international specialty
chemicals company and also has interests in energy, health care,
manufacturing and services.

   Corn and soybean futures prices fell in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade after the National
Weather Service forecast a continuation of ideal crop weather for
the Midwest.
   Wheat futures were narrowly mixed in early trading.
   In a pair of forecasts issued late Friday, the weather service
predicted normal to above-normal rainfall and temperatures for
Midwestern growing regions this weekend and early next week, and
normal conditions through mid-August.
   This afternoon's weekly Agriculture Department crop-progress
report was expected to show corn pollination off to a good start.
   Martyn Foreman, a corn market analyst with AgriVisor Services
Inc. in Bloomington, Ill., said the critical pollination phase will
last longer this year because heavy springtime rains delayed some
corn planting.
   ``We probably will see some weather anxieties resurface,'' he
said, ``but right now peope seem pretty confident about what we've
gotten so far.''
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.06{ a bushel; corn
futures were 1} cents to 4} cents lower with July at $2.75{ a
bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2} cents lower with July at $1.23{ a

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August
at 75.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .28
cent higher with August at 87.57 cents a pound; live hogs were .40

   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States decreased for the third consecutive week to total
1,001, Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   The count declined by 10 this week after drops of nine and one
in the previous respective weeks. A year ago this week, the count
was 820, Baker Hughes said.
   Baker Hughes' rig count reflects the number of rotary rigs
actively exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the
number of producing wells.
   The Houston-based oil toolmaker company has kept track of the
rig count _ the widely watched index of drilling activity _ since
1940.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas had the biggest decline
with nine. California, Colorado and Kansas all reported a loss of
five followed by Pennsylvania, three; and Michigan, New Mexico and
Wyoming, one each.
   Oklahoma had the biggest gain with seven, followed by North
Dakota, five; and Louisiana, one. Ohio remained unchanged from last

   Aluminum Company of America reported Monday
that its second quarter profit plunged 43 percent due to decreased
prices and reduced income from the company's Brazilian affiliate.
   The world's largest aluminum producer said it earned $161.9
million, or $1.86 a share, in the three months ended June 30,
compared with $285.2 million, or $3.21 a share, in the same quarter
of 1989.
   Sales fell to $2.69 billion from $2.76 billion.
   For the first half of 1990, Alcoa's earnings fell nearly 45
percent to $310.5 million, or $3.55 a share, from $561.2 million,
or $6.33 a share. Half-year sales also fell, to $5.33 billion from
$5.38 billion.
   Alcoa said the drop in earnings reflect a 24 percent drop in
aluminum ingot prices and lower fabricated product sales.
   In addition, the company's Brazilian affiliate, Alcoa Aluminio,
reported sharply lower earnings, $6 million in the first half,
compared with $61 million in 1989. The decrease was attributed to
government actions taken to improve that country's economy.

   Share prices finished higher Monday on London's
Stock Exchange, as a drop in British retail sales figures led to
optimism about chances for an interest rate cut.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 24.3
points, or 1 percent, to 2,406.5.
   Volume came to 346.9 million shares compared with 399.2 million
shares Friday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 20.8 points at 1,900.9
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 11.36 points
to close at 1,295.58.
   The government said retail sales fell 2.8 percent in June,
improving prospects for lower interest rates.

<HEAD>Bayer to Acquire Citric Acid Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bayer USA Inc. said Monday its parent company
has signed a contract to buy the citric acid business and assets of
a plant in the United Kingdom for about $100 million.
   The agreement would give Bayer AG of West Germany the ability to
make 23,000 tons of citric acid in Europe, increasing the company's
worldwide capacity to 150,000 tons of the chemical per year, the
company said.
   Bayer _ a diversified company which makes health-care, organic
and industrial products _ said Rhone-Poulenc's Sturge plant in
Shelby, Yorkshire, could be expanded to produce 36,000 tons of
citric acid with ``relatively minor investment.''
   The company said it would integrate the business into the
Haarmann &amp; Reimer Food Ingredients Division of Bayer UK Ltd.
   Citric acid is used in the food, beverage, pharmeceutical and
detergent industries.

   NCR Corp. said Monday that record revenue
and efforts to contain costs helped the cash register and computer
company increase earnings by 5 percent to a record level in the
second quarter.
   Earnings totaled $155 million, compared with $110 million for
the same period last year.
   Earnings per share increased by 17 percent to $1.66, also a
record, the company said, compared with $1.42 in 1989's second
quarter. NCR's repurchase of 2.2 million shares during the second
quarter helped per-share earnings but lessened the increase in net
income.
   The company said second-quarter revenue increased 5 percent to
$1.60 billion, compared with $1.53 billion for the year-earlier
period.
   Charles E. Exley Jr., chairman and chief executive officer, said
the higher revenue as well as efforts to contain expenses
contributed to the increased earnings. But he said they were
partially offset by the share repurchase program and increased
research and development spending.
   Earnings for the first six months totaled $167 million, down 2
percent from $171 million during the same period a year ago.
Earnings per share were $2.38, down from $2.17.
   Revenue increased to a record $2.87 billion for the six months,
up 3 percent from $2.78 billion a year ago.
   The company said the dollar value of its orders abroad set a
second-quarter record, offsetting a decline in U.S. orders.
   NCR develops, makes, markets, installs and services business
information processing systems worldwide.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decade after a high-speed train linking this
gaming community and Southern California was first proposed, a
partnership today plunked down $500,000 along with the first formal
bid on the $5 billion project.
   Bechtel International Inc. of San Francisco and Transrapid of
West Germany are expected to be the only bidders for the right to
build a train that would cruise up to 300 mph on elevated track
running alongside interstate highways between Las Vegas and
Anaheim, Calif. The bidding deadline is later today.
   Company officials presented the California-Nevada Super Speed
Train Commission with a 3-inc-thick proposal detailing the 272-mile
route.
   ``We feel we are about to revolutionize ground transportation in
the United States,'' said Arnie Adamsen, a Las Vegas city
councilman and chairman of the commission.
   Bechtel Vice President Erv Koenig told the group that the
proposed high-tech train, using magnetic force to propel the
trains, will be ``a pilot system that will be the first part of a
network that will eventually encompass the southwest and the
nation.''
   Once opposed by many alifornia officials as a ``gambler's
special'' of little benefit to the Los Angeles area, the train is
seen now by some as the possible beginning of a mass transit system
that could link large portions of Southern California.
   But even its strongest backers are not buying tickets quite yet.
   The proposed train faces enormous hurdles, not the least of
which is its massive price tag and the uncertainty it would attract
enough riders to be profitable. The earliest it could be in
operation is the late 1990s.
   Bechtel officials themselves say they will need to study the
project at least another 16 months before deciding whether to
proceed.
   ``A lot depends on what we find in our own feasibility study,''
Koenig said last week. ``All we're working on now is the existing
data, and we have to go out and confirm or deny that data.''
   The proposed service would whisk passengers between the two
cities in little more than an hour. It now takes five hours by car.
   ``I think it has a three-out-of-four chance of succeeding,''
said Paul Taylor, executive director of the train commission. ``But
anything like this has potential for environmental delay which
could foul up the financing.''
   Koenig said Bechtel is taking a cautious approach to the project
by applying for the franchise so it can do its own ridership
surveys and other studies before deciding whether to go futher.
   ``We're famous for doing large projects,'' said Koenig, citing
the BART mass transit system in San Francico. ``But a project of
this magnitude, you have to take one step at a time.''
   A ridership survey done earlier by a consulting firm for the
commission suggested that an Anaheim to Las Vegas run would get 6.5
million round trip passengers a year at a cost of about $110.
   As projected by Bechtel, the train would also provide several
Southern California stops for commuters, and could later be
expanded to link other California communities.
   Aside from financing, Bechtel also faces major obstacles in its
plan to use trains powered by magnetic levitation. Maglev trains
float one to four inches above a single guideway, lifted and
propelled along by a wave of magnetic energy.
   The only maglev train in existence is in Emsland, West Germany,
where Transrapid's prototype glides along a 20-mile test track at
speeds of about 250 mph.
   Members of the bistate rail commission were impressed by the
train during a visit to Germany in March, but questioned whether
the technology was in place to build such an ambitious project.
   ``I've tried to ride the maglev three times now and I've never
been on the entire track because it wasn't certified for
operation,'' said California state Sen. Bill Leonard. ``I need a
better level of confidence that it can be done.''
   The idea of a speedy train linking Las Vegas with the lucrative
Southern California market that provides the bulk of the 18 million
tourists who visit each year was first raised in 1979 by then-Mayor
Bill Briare.
   It wasn't until 1988, however, after a federally funded study
showed the project was feasible, that the bistate train commission
was established.
   Since the train project received its first serious studies in
the mid-1980s, the projected price tag has doubled from an
estimated $2.5 billion to Bechtel's current estimate of $5.1
billion.

   The stock market surged back to the ``Dow
3,000'' level today in buying encouraged by an upbeat earnings
report from International Business Machines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 75.25 points last
week en route to a succession of new highs, rose 27.23 to 3,007.43
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 878 up, 621
down and 504 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrial average reached 3,000 for the first
time in a brief run early Friday afternoon, then settled back to
2,980.20, still a new closing high.
   Analysts said traders got some fresh inspiration this morning
when IBM posted second-quarter profits of $2.45 a share, up from
$2.31 in the like period last year.
   The results came in near the upper end of the range of analysts'
estimates on Wall Street.
   Brokers said the report encouraged traders who have been
expecting the market to struggle through a lot of disappointments
in the peak days ahead for midyear earnings reports.
   IBM shares gained 1~ to 122~.
   On a less sanguine note, Chase Manhattan Corp., a leading New
York banking company, said quarterly earnings slumped to 24 cents
from $1.31 in the second quarter last year.
   Chase stock dropped { to 20}.
   McDonnell Douglas fell 1~ to 43 after the troubled aerospace
company outlined a cost-cutting program that would save $700
million annually through layoffs, attrition and other austerity
measures.
   The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.19
to 201.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index
was up 1.70 at 365.69.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 120.9 million shares with an

<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The BFGoodrich Co. said Monday its
second-quarter earnings rose 5.9 percent from the same period last
year, largely due to a gain on the sale of its rights in a tire
venture.
   The company reported net income of $55.4 million, or $2.10 per
share, for the three months ended June 30, compared with $52.3
million, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter edged up to $632.5 million from $628.8
million a year earlier.
   A key factor in the earnings rise was a $20.5 million after-tax
gain resulting from the sale of The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. to
Michelin, the company said.
   Uniroyal Goodrich Tire was formed as a joint venture in 1986
when BF Goodrich and Uniroyal Holdings combined their tire
operations.
   Goodrich sold its 50 percent stake in the venture in June 1988,
and received cash plus a warrant to buy equity in the company.
   But when Michelin bought Uniroyal Goodrich Tire in May, Goodrich
surrendered its warrant to buy equity in Uniroyal Goodrich and the
after-tax gain for the second quarter reflected what it was paid.
   Second-quarter income from continuing operations at BFGoodrich
was $34.9 million, or $1.29 per share, down 34 percent from the
same quarter of 1989.
   ``Our second-quarter results were in line with our
expectations,'' said John D. Ong, BFGoodrich chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``While prices for vinyl products remained below last year's
peak, we benefited significantly from the increased contribution
from our specialty chemicals and aerospace businesses, which now
account for half of the company's sales,'' he said.
   BFGoodrich said its geon vinyl products segment reported
operating income of $24.7 million for the second period, compared
with $57.3 million last year.
   Its specialty chemicals division had operating income of $27.3
million, up 13 percent from the second quarter of 1989.
   Its aerospace business reported $19.1 million in operating
income, a 43 percent increase over the $13.4 million in last year's
first quarter.
   For the first half of the year, Goodrich said it earned $71.6
million, or $2.66 per share, down 32 percent from $105.3 milliopn,
or $4 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the half from continuing operations slipped to $1.22
billion from $1.24 billion a year earlier.

   The stock market advanced to another record
level today and pushed the Dow Jones industrial average within a
hair of breaking the 3,000-point barrier, but sellers kept that
psychological hurdle beyond reach.
   The best-known barometer of the stock market remained well above
3,000 for much of the session, buoyed partly by a
better-than-expected midyear earnings report from International
Business Machines Corp., an important component of the 30 big-name
stocks that comprise the Dow average.
   But late-afternoon selling pushed prices off their highest
levels of the day, in indication to many professional strategists
that a good deal of pessimism persists about the vitality and
duration of the market's recent strength. The volume and breadth of
trading remained relatively light.
   ``I don't see across the board participation. I see
participation in stocks that are in the big indices,'' said John
Eberley, equity trader at the Chicago Corp. investment firm,
``Somebody's going to catch up or somebody's going to come down,
one of the two.''

   Boise Cascade Corp. said Monday it
second-quarter profit tumbled 69.5 percent, mainly due to falling
prices.
   The wood product manufacturer reported Monday that earnings in
the April-June period totaled $23 million, or 52 cents a share,
down from $75.3 million, or $1.68 a share, for the same quarter a
year ago.
   Sales slipped to $1.06 billion from $1.10 billion a year earlier.
   That left profits for the first half of 1990 at $56.6 million,
or $1.31 a share, down from $153.5 million, or $3.42 a share, a
year earlier.
   First-half sales slipped to $2.13 billion from $2.20 billion a
year earlier.
   Chairman John Fery said lower prices for products in the
company's paper, office and building segments were largely
responsible for the earnings decline.
   Boise Cascade posted a gain from completing the sale of its
Speciality Paperboard Division during the quarter, but it was
largely offset by the cost of signing bonuses in connection with
labor settlements at paper mills in Minnesota and Alabama.
   Fery also said the 59 percent drop in operating income from the
paper segment, which accounts for over half of Boise Cascade's
sales, was caused by operating problems at pulp and paper mills in
Maine, Washington, Alabama and Louisiana that occurred during
routine maintenance or capital improvements.
   Higher delivered log costs coupled with weaker prices for
ponderosa pine, which accounts for over half the company's lumber
production, contributed to the 43 percent decline in operating
income from the building products segment, Fery said.
   And slowing sales growth in the office products area along with
lower-than-anticipated margins forced operating income from that
segment to retreat slightly from last year's record level, he said.
   ``Prospects for our building products business are uncertain as
a result of weaker housing starts and high Northwest wood costs,''
Fery said. ``And we have planned major capital-related downtime at
our paper mills in International Falls, Minn., and Rumford, Maine.
However, we believe we are at or near the cyclical trough for
newsprint and uncoated papers.''

   Chase Manhattan Corp. said Monday its second quarter profit
plunged 62 percent from a year earlier, partly because it raised
its loan-loss provision to cover problem commercial real estate
loans.
   First Chicago Corp. also posted lower results, with its second
quarter net income dropping by 35 percent due to higher expenses
and a big addition to its loan loss reserve.
   J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Inc. posted flat earnings, while two other
major banking companies, Security Pacific Corp. and NCNB Corp.,
reported higher income.
   Chase, based in New York, said its quarterly income fell to $52
million, or 24 cents per share, from $137 million, or $1.31 a
share, in 1989. For the first half of 1990, Chase netted $96
million, or 44 cents a share, down 64 percent from $269 million, or
$2.59 per share, last year.
   First Chicago said its profit fell to $87.4 million, or $1.22
per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $134.4 million,
or $1.98 per share, for the same period a year ago. Six month
profit fell 39.8 percent to $156 million, or $2.15 per share, from
$259.1 million, or $3.83 per share, a year earlier.
   New York-based Morgan earned $207 million, or $1.06 per share,
in the quarter, compared with earnings of $206 million, or $1.09 a
share. Half-year income totaled $606 million, or $3.16 per share,
up 57 percent from earnings of $386 million, or $2.05.
   Los Angeles-based Security Pacific reported a 6 percent rise in
its quarterly profit to $195.2 million, or $1.59 per share, from
$184.5 million, or $1.58 per share. For the half year, it earned
$386.6 million, or $3.13 per share, up 5 percent from $363.88
million, or $3.12 per share.
   NCNB's net income totaled $137.4 million, or $1.30 per share, a
50 percent increase over earnings of $91.5 million, or $1 a share,
in 1989. In the first half, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company
earned $277.48 million, or $2.64 per share, up 66 percent from
$167.32 million, or $1.82.
   Chase, one of the nation's largest commercial construction
lenders, said its quarterly income was hurt by its decision to
raise its credit-loss provision by $75 million to $225 million. All
of the increase was to protect itself from declining real estate
values in commercial markets.
   The company said declines in foreign exchange trading revenue
and higher operating costs also offset gains in net interest
revenue and in fees and commissions.
   First Chicago increased its second-quarter provision against
credit losses to $85 million from $60 million. Of the total, $32
million was allocated for commercial loan exposure and $53 million
for consumer exposure.
   Net interest income slipped slightly during the quarter to
$332.6 million from $333.6 million while noninterest income rose 3
percent to $282 million from $272.5 million, the Chicago-based bank
holding company said in a statement.
   First Chicago said it reduced its exposure to troubled Third
World loans to $465 million on June 30 compared with $693 million
on March 31 through a combination of charge-offs and loan sales.
   Morgan said its revenue rose from various trading activities,
such as dealings in foreign exchange, precious metals and U.S. and
foreign debt securities. However, that was offset by lower
corporate finance fees and net interest income and a 10 percent
jump in operating expenses, it said.
   Security Pacific attributed its higher quarterly profit to
strength in its primary markets, California and Washington state.
Those areas have outpaced other parts of the country in economic
growth, particularly the Northeast, which is served by banks like
Chase.
   The company said non-interest income grew by 12 percent while
non-interest expenses were up only 2 percent.
   NCNB also said it was affected by weakness in certain real
estate markets. But while there was an increase in reported
nonperforming loans, it said, net interest income and non-interest
income rose significantly.

<HEAD>Oil Futures Higher; Wholesale Gasoline Surges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures finished sharply higher in heavy
trading Monday led by a surge in wholesale gasoline prices.
   Reports of a weekend pipeline accident in the Soviet Union
buoyed prices in London and the buying enthusiasm spilled over into
the oil futures pits on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Crude oil prices also got a boost from continuing speculation
about output reductions planned by OPEC members.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 31 cents to $18.67 a
42-gallon barrel, more than making up for Friday's 10-cent loss.
Later crude contracts posted even stronger gains, with the
September contract up 50 cents, to $19.85.
   Gasoline prices shot up. The August contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline soared 2.49 cents to 64.44 cents a gallon, which
expanded on Friday's gain of 1.38 cents. The contracts for delivery
during September through November also climbed higher.
   Home heating oil for August delivery gained 2.03 cents to 56.24
cents a gallon after adding 1.17 cents on Friday. Subsequent
contracts posted similarly sized increases.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.495 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.500 Friday.
   Mary Haskins, an energy trader at PaineWebber Inc., said sketchy
news accounts of incidents in the Soviet Union that disrupted
production of natural gas touched off a rally in London, which
spread to New York.
   She cited two reports: one of a natural gas pipeline accident
and another of an explosion causing an oil field fire. Details were
unavailable but the disruptions in Soviet output were expected to
be temporary, she said.
   Meanwhile, the possibility that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries soon might undertake some effective steps to
prop up world oil prices continued to encourage buying, she said.
   Oil traders are paying close attention to the oil cartel as it
prepares for a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on July 25. The
cartel's inability to rein in its members' oil output has weighed
down prices for months.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Cutting 11 Percent Of Its Jobs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. announced plans Monday
to reduce its workforce by up to 11 percent, about 17,000 jobs, and
cut other costs in an effort to shore up the aerospace giant's
sagging bottom line.
   John F. McDonnell, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the measures should save the company more than $700 million this
year, or about 5 percent of annual expenses, and put the nation's
largest defense contractor on ``very solid footing.''
   He said the company has to become more efficient and profitable
in order to ensure that its record backlog of commercial jet orders
and other business opportunities were part of a bright future, not
a nagging nightmare.
   ``We tried to work it without having significant job reductions,
but in the final analysis we had to come to this,'' McDonnell told
a news conference.
   McDonnell Douglas stock fell $2.50 to $42.37{ a share on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Company officials had said in June that they planned substantial
layoffs, although some securities analysts and union officials said
the cuts were a little deeper than they expected.
   ``We've seen a lot of changes at McDonnell Douglas and most of
them have been rather ineffectual. But positive effects from this
plan should start showing up right away and that's when we'll
become believers,'' said Paul Nisbet, a stock analyst for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Nisbet said he would have liked to see McDonnell Douglas embark
on a long-term cost-cutting program, as competitor Boeing Co. did
several years ago with a five-year, 25 percent cost-reduction plan.
   ``That's why Boeing's making a lot of money and McDonnell
Douglas isn't,'' Nisbet said.
   McDonnell Douglas reported a $2 million profit for the first
quarter of the year, down 98 percent from the same period a year
earlier. For 1989, profit fell 37 percent to $219 million and would
have been much lower if not for a one-time $178 million gain from
an accounting change.
   Much of the financial weakness stems from losses at Douglas
Aircraft Co., the company's Long Beach, Calif. subsidiary, which
has been struggling with an overwhelming commercial jet order
backlog, cost overruns and a major overhaul in corporate work rules.
   The company faces large investment costs in its
not-yet-certified MD-11 commercial jumbo jet and has experienced
production problems with its MD-80 commercial airliners.
   McDonnell Douglas also has had problems with defense aircraft
and faces the prospect of major cuts in defense spending.
   The Senate Armed Service Committee on Friday approved a $289
billion defense authorization bill that would slash the Pentagon's
proposed budget and cloud the future of several major aircraft
programs.
   The company faces serious cost problems on three military
programs, the C-17 cargo plane, the A-12 advanced tactical aircraft
and the T-45 Goshawk trainer.
   Lawrence Harris, an analyst with Bateman, Eichler, Hill,
Richards in Los Angeles, said he was taking a cautious view of the
cost-cutting plan's chances of success.
   ``To be sure, McDonnell Douglas faces a number of challenges.
Several of their mature defense programs could be coming to an end
and, at the same time, newer programs are incurring cost growth.
Also, the effort to turn around Douglas Aircraft is unfinished,''
Harris said.
   The company expects to eliminate between 14,000 and 17,000 jobs
through layoffs and attrition, McDonnell said. The bulk of the cuts
will be made in St. Louis and Long Beach, Calif.
   About 4,500 jobs will be cut in the St. Louis area, where
McDonnell employs about 40,500 workers and does much of its defense
work. About 8,000 jobs will be cut in Long Beach, where the company
employs 47,000 and makes commercial aircraft and does some defense
work.
   Another 800 jobs will be trimmed at a helicopter operation in
Mesa, Ariz., and another 1,000 jobs will be eliminated elsewhere in
the country, the company said.
   When attrition and job elimination are included, the company
said, up to 17,000 positions could be trimmed under the plan.
   The cost-cutting plan also includes reduced capital budgets,
significant cuts in budgets for travel, consultants, advertising
and other support activities, restrictions on overtime and a 50
percent reduction in company contributions to the salaried savings
plans.
   McDonnell said job fairs, resume services and counseling would
be offered to help laid off workers find new jobs.

<HEAD>Health Care Benefits Will Take Plenty of Time at Bargaining Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health care cost issues will take up a
lot of time in this summer's auto industry labor negotiations, a
Ford Motor Co. executive said Monday.
   ``Health care is just a mega-issue,'' said the executive, who
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Ford has three bargaining priorities during talks with the
United Auto Workers union: improving vehicle quality, holding down
costs and getting the union to agree to flexibility in how cars are
made.
   The union has said protecting current jobs for its members is
the top bargaining priority for each of the automakers.
Improvements in pensions, wages and health care benefits follow.
   Negotiations between the UAW and Ford open Thursday. Talks
between the union and General Motors Corp. open Wednesday. Chrysler
Corp. and the UAW open talks Friday. UAW contracts with each of the
Big Three expire Sept. 14.
   The Ford executive estimated his company pays about $4,200
annually in health care for each of its 175,000 active and retired
employees. That's less than Chrysler's $4,600 for its approximately
60,000 workers and slightly more than the $3,800 a year that GM
pays for each of its 400,000 unionized workers.
   Automakers long have complained their health care costs put them
in a hole compared with Japanese companies making cars and trucks
in the United States. The average age of UAW workers at the Big
Three is about 42 years. The estimated average age of a worker in
the so called transplant companies is in the mid- to upper-20s.
   Chrysler chief negotiator Anthony St. John has said simply
continuing the current level of company-paid health benefits for
its workers would add 16 percent to Chrysler's labor costs.
   Automakers and the union have been looking for ways to cut
health-care costs while maintaining benefits. One is for employees
to switch from traditional health-care coverage, such as Blue Cross
and Blue Shield, to health maintenance organizations or preferred
provider organizations.
   ``There is no doubt that the HMOs are a cost savings,'' the Ford
executive said. Thirty percent to 40 percent of UAW-covered
employees at the Big Three are members of HMOs or PPOs.
   Another expensive issue will be how to get cost of living
protection for UAW retirees, whose numbers nearly equal the union's
active Big Three membership of about 500,000.
   Union leaders are being pressured by the retirees to push for
cost-of-living protection keyed to the inflation rate. Both sides
say that could cost billions of dollars.
   ``Maybe the clue to pensions is what has been done in the last
couple of agreements,'' the Ford executive said. Lump-sum payments
have been used in the past to offset inflation-spurred erosion of
retirement benefits.
   Ford also wants more flexibility in its manufacturing plants and
how they are supplied. The executive said quality, cost and
delivery speed determine whether a part or component will be made
at a Ford plant. The union wants that work done at plants rather
than having the work sent to a company where labor is cheaper.
   If negotiations proceed as they have in the past, the union will
bargain with each of the Big Three through July and August.
Sometime around Labor Day, the UAW will pick a ``target'' company.
   Talks will be suspended at the other two and focused at the
target. An agreement at that company then will be taken to the
others resulting in similar contracts at each of the Big Three.
   The Ford executive said would like to see Ford picked as the
target because the No. 2 automaker would be able to tailor the
contract to its needs. But he thinks the union will pick GM.

<HEAD>RJR Nabisco Announces Recapitalization Details</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of von der Heyden in grafs 6, 7, 8, 14 and
15.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   RJR Nabisco Inc. announced Monday the details of
a $6.9 billion recapitalization plan the company says will include
the retirement of more than $3 billion in junk bonds and a $1.15
billion bridge loan.
   The recapitalization is aimed at reducing RJR Nabisco's most
expensive debt, leaving the firm less vulnerable to the problems
that have undermined other debt-burdened companies over the past
year.
   Under the plan, RJR Nabisco's debt will be reduced to less than
$20 billion from the current level of approximately $23 million,
said Karl von der Heyden, the company's executive vice president
and chief financial officer.
   The recapitalization includes a previously announced $1.7
billion cash infusion by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the
investment firm that engineered the record $24.53 billion leveraged
buyout of RJR Nabisco last year. Kohlberg Kravis said last month it
planned to recapitalize the food and tobacco company, but released
few details of the plan.
   The plan will be financed with the $1.7 billion from Kohlberg
Kravis plus $2.25 billion in new bank loans. The loans are expected
to carry interest rates of 12 percent to 13 percent, compared with
the 16 percent to 17 percent rates that RJR Nabisco junk bonds will
carry.
   RJR Nabisco plans to repurchase at least 51 percent of its junk
bonds known as subordinated exchange debentures with a maturity
date of 2007, von der Heyden said in a telephone interview.
   The company also expected to retire at least 85 percent of junk
bonds called senior converting debentures that are due in 2009. Up
to 85 percent of these securities will be exchanged for cash and a
new issue of preferred stock in RJR Nabisco, with additional bonds
possibly being acquired for cash, von der Heyden said.
   After the recapitalization, ``we will probably have something in
excess of $3 billion of those two issues'' out of the $7 billion
currently outstanding, von der Heyden said.
   RJR Nabisco said it hoped to complete the recapitalization by
next April.
   The company also announced it was resetting the interest rates
on the junk bonds from the current 14.07 percent to 17 percent for
the subordinated exchange debentures and 17.375 percent for the
senior converting debentures.
   By the terms under which the bonds were issued, RJR Nabisco had
to reset the interest rate to make up for any price declines in the
bonds. Because bond prices and interest rates move inversely, and
the market price for the securities has declined since their issue,
the company had to offer a higher rate at the reset.
   The recapitalization also will allow RJR Nabisco to repay the
$1.15 billion bridge loan used to complete the leveraged buyout.
   In return for its $1.7 billion cash infusion, Kohlberg Kravis
will receive a new issue of common stock in RJR Nabisco valued at
$6.25 a share, RJR Nabisco said. Kohlberg Kravis also was
exchanging $200 million of its own bridge loan to RJR Nabisco for
$200 million in preferred stock.
   Von der Heyden said RJR Nabisco planned to reduce its debt load
steadily during the next few years. ``One of the things that will
help us is we're retiring a lot of junk debt,'' he said.
   After this recapitalization is completed the company will
consider further debt retirement, but ``this will not come up for
quite a while,'' von der Heyden said.
   ``We will always look at ways to bring down our effective
interest rates and try to tackle the most expensive debt first,''
he said, referring to the remaining junk bonds.
   He noted that junk bond debt cannot be retired without the
agreement of RJR Nabisco's bankers. The company's bank loans have a
higher repayment priority than do junk bondholders.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher While Gold Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved higher against most major
foreign currencies Monday although traders continued to worry about
the direction of U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices fell.
   Analysts said the dollar continued to recover from a midday
decline on Friday, when the Federal Reserve added funds to the
banking system and financial markets interpreted the move as a
relaxation of the Fed's credit policy.
   When the Fed relaxes credit and allows interest rates to fall,
the dollar tends to decline because it is supported by higher U.S.
rates.
   Trading was light. James T. McGroarty, senior vice president
with Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Connecticut, said the market
was uncertain about what Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan might say
Wednesday about the central bank's policy when he testifies before
the Senate Banking Committee.
   ``I think the market's a little fearful of getting too far ahead
of itself until they can understand why he's done what he's done
and and how far he's going to go,'' McGroarty said.
   Overseas dealers reported continuing speculation that U.S.
interest rates might be lowered after the May trade deficit figures
are released Wednesday. Some growth in the trade deficit is
expected from the previously reported $6.94 billion in April.
   The dollar put in a mixed performance against the British pound.
In New York, the pound rose to $1.8033 from late Friday's $1.8005,
but in earlier London trading, sterling fell to $1.8040 from
$1.8055 late Friday.
   The dollar was unchanged against the Japanese yen in New York,
closing at 148.15 yen. In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.43 yen from
147.42 yen at Friday's close, and it was quoted in London at 148.05
yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6545 West German marks, up from 1.6510; 1.4180
Swiss francs, up from 1.4025; 5.5500 French francs, up from 5.5390;
1,211.00 Italian lire, up from 1,208.75; and 1.15865 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.15785.
   Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with Friday's late rates,
included: 1.6535 West German marks, up from 1.6430; 1.4165 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3925; 5.5460 French francs, up from 5.5115;
1.8640 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8520; 1,210.75 Italian lire, up
from 1,203.25, and 1.1587 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1576.
   Gold prices slipped lower in New York, closing at $363.30 a troy
ounce on the Commodity Exchange, down $1.10 from late Friday.
Republic National Bank recorded a late bid of $362.50, down $1.50.
   Gold traded in London late Monday at $362.75 a troy ounce, down
from $364.55 late Friday. The late price in Zurich was $362.70,
down from $364.20.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $363.11 an ounce, down from
Saturday's $363.59.
   Silver prices also declined. In New York, a troy ounce of silver
fell 6.1 cents to $4.847 a troy ounce. Earlier in London, silver
was bid at a late price of $4.89, down from $4.93 late Friday.

   Stocks hit record levels again Monday and the
Dow Jones industrial average reached its third straight all-time
high, tantalizing Wall Streeters by closing within a hair of 3,000
for the first time.
   But trading was light in what some strategists regarded as an
uncertain market. Many investors didn't participate and some
expressed cynicism about an obsession with the behavior of the Dow
index, which can move sharply if any one of its 30 big-name
components rises or falls in one large trade.
   The best-known stock barometer, which has risen nearly 100
points this month and briefly forayed aboved 3,000 for the first
time Friday, remained in that territory for much of the session
Monday. But it weakened in a bout of selling in the late afternoon
and finished at 2,999.75, up 19.55.
   ``It's just another number, another barrier,'' said Peter J.
DaPuzzo, head of world equities for Lehman Brothers in New York.
Philip Rettew, a vice president at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., called the
Dow-3,000 barrier ``about as important as your 50th birthday.''
   Strategists said buying was largely motivated by the influences
that drove the market last week and pushed the Dow index to record
closes Thursday and Friday: indications that the Federal Reseve was
easing interest rates to forestall a recession, and an improved
outlook for corporate earnings.
   International Business Machines's announcement of
higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings Monday bolstered the
optimism and set the tone for much of the day. Some other leading
companies also reported strong earnings results. ``The market's
come a long way. It barreled ahead, got tired and backed away,''
said Lawrence Wachtel, a senior strategist for Prudential Bache
Securities Inc.
   ``And then there's the Dow 3,000, oh boy,'' he said. ``Some
people feel 2,999.75 is the pits, but 3,000.15 would be salvation.
There's too much hype about it.''
   Some brokers said events that could have hurt the market, like a
weakening dollar and word of a drastically higher federal budget
deficit, had little or no influence on stock prices, an indication
of market strength.
   But others said the market's indecisive move higher, as
reflected in the Dow average's inability to close above 3,000,
showed that many investors are nervous and unwilling to commit
money to stocks.
   ``The only thing that worries me is the lack of volume,'' said
Blake Stephens, vice president of over-the-counter trading at
Interstate Johnson Lane Securities in Charlotte, N.C. ``If it
closes above 3,000 with good volume, you'll see come money come out
of the woodwork.''
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
868 up, 678 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 149.43 million
shares, down substantially from the 215.60 million traded the
previous session.
   Among the most prominent issues was IBM, which announced before
the market opened that second-quarter earnings rose 5.2 percent
from a year earlier, better than many had expected. IBM finished at
122&rsqb;, up 1&rsqb;.
   Other technology stocks also did well on strong second-quarter
earnings results. NCR, which said earnings advanced 5 percent to a
record, jumped 3~ to 68.
   Banking stocks, considered vulnerable because of the weak real
estate market in much of the country, also did surprisingly well on
better-than expected earnings results. J.P. Morgan rose 2&lsqb; to 37~,
and NCNB rose 1} to 36{. But Chase Manhattan, one of the biggest
banking companies, fell { to 20} in heavy trading after reporting a
62 percent drop in second-quarter results.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 183.86 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $12.67 billion, or 0.36
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.80 to 201.13.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.99 to 437.37, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index hit a record 368.95, up 1.64,
eclipsing the 367.40 record set June 4.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.16 to 469.60. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 1.59 to 365.58.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Hit 3-Month Low On Fine Weather, Slack Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices sank Monday to their lowest levels in three
months on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting forecasts for more
good growing weather and a lack of strong export demand.
   Other grain and soybean futures also ended lower.
   On other commodity markets, energy futures rose sharply; hog
futures soared; cattle futures were mixed; and precious metals
retreated.
   Corn futures settled 6\ cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in July down 5{ cents at $2.73{ a bushel, the
lowest closing price for a near-month corn contract since April 16.
   Wheat futures finished 4 cents to 5} cents lower with July at

at $1.21{ a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents to 15 cents lower with
July at $5.97\ a bushel.
   The steep losses in the corn and soybean markets reflected
Friday's National Weather Service forecast for normal temperatures
and rainfall in the Midwest through mid-August.
   After Monday's close, the weather service issued a six-to-10-day
forecast predicting more good crop weather in the Midwest:
above-normal rainfall and normal to below-normal temperatures July
22-26.
   That kind of weather would help the corn crop through its
critical pollination phase, which was under way in about 12 percent
of the crop as of Sunday, according to a weekly Agriculture
Department report issued after the close.
   Pollination is lagging behind the normal pace of 38 percent,
though, and is likely to go on for an unusually long period this
year because heavy spring rains delayed some corn planting, said
Marty Foreman, a corn market analyst with AgriVisor Services Inc.
in Bloomington, Ill.
   ``We probably will see some weather anxieties resurface,'' he
said, ``but right now people seem pretty confident about what we've
gotten so far.''
   The crop-progress report also showed 19 percent of soybeans
blooming compared with a 40 percent average.
   The USDA rated 75 percent of the corn crop good to excellent
compared with 68 percent a week ago. The portion of the soybean
crop rated good to excellent was 58 percent compared with 54
percent a week ago.
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the Board of Trade, said slack export demand for U.S.
grain also contributed to Monday's price drop.
   He said the absence of China and the Soviet Union from the
market was especially apparent.
   ``Typically, they're in here buying corn and wheat at this time
of year and they have not shown up,'' he said.
   Petroleum futures rose strongly on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, paced by strong gains in the refined products amid more
bullish news from OPEC.
   Oil-producing countries Abu Dhabi and Saudi Ababia announced
cutbacks in allocations to customers, and Iranian oil minister
Aghazadeh continued to express confidence in the cartel's ability
to reach a price-support agreement at their mid-year conference,
beginning July 26.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 50 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in August at $18.67 a barrel;
heating oil surged 1.07 cents to 2.03 cents with August at 56.24
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.8 cents to 2.49 cents
higher with August at 64.44 cents a gallon.
   Near-term hog futures soared the 2-cents-a-pound permitted daily
limit on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in line with gains in the
cash market prompted by relatively tight supplies of market-ready
hogs.
   Livestock and meat futures also were supported by expectations
that two USDA reports due out Friday will show a continued decline
in frozen pork belly stocks and a slowdown in placements of cattle
onto feedlots, said Charles K. Levitt, senior livestock analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Live cattle futures settled unchanged to .22 cent lower with
August at 75.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to
.20 cent higher with August at 87.37 cents a pound; live hogs were
.85 cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at 62.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .90 cent higher with July at
49.50 cents a pound.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1.10 to
$1.30 lower with August at $364.50 a troy ounce; silver futures
were 6.1 cents to 6.3 cents lower with July at $4.847 a troy ounce.

   The White House hiked its forecast of next
year's budget deficit to $168.8 billion on Monday _ $231.4 billion
if savings and loan costs are counted _ and warned of devastating
cuts in programs without a quick budget compromise with Congress.
   The new estimate was more than two-thirds higher than the
administration's projection just six months ago.
   Airport control towers could be closed, student loans canceled,
food inspections interrupted and military forces halved by cutting
perhaps one million people as the government buckled under what
could be over $100 billion in automatic cuts this October, said
Budget Director Richard Darman.
   It seemed unlikely that Congress would permit cuts on such a
huge scale. And White House officials conceded that easing was
needed in the nation's deficit-reduction law, which mandates
spending cuts across a broad range of programs if targets for
reducing federal red ink are not met.
   But administration officials insisted they would support a
watering down of the Gramm-Rudman budget-balancing law only if
coupled with a $50 billion package of spending cuts and new taxes.
   Two-month-old ``budget summit'' talks between the administration
and congressional leaders on a deficit-reduction package have
seemed bogged down despite President Bush's reversal of his ``no
new taxes'' pledge three weeks ago.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said the
consequences of a $100 billion Gramm-Rudman cut would be so severe
that the budget negotiators must somehow work out a deal.
   ``The crisis is real,'' Panetta told reporters. ``These numbers
should hit the White House, Congress and the summit like a fire
alarm in the middle of the night.''
   However, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.,
said the numbers were nothing new, and he contended the talks were
stalled because of a lack of leadership from Bush. He called on the
president to address the nation, explaining the extent of the
budget problem, laying out his solution and explaining the
consequences of failure.
   The ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., said the new deficit figures would serve as a
warning to any lawmakers who want the budget talks to fail and to
those he said are making ``ultimatums.''
   Monday's revised deficit projection was up $10 billion from the
administration's informal estimate just a month ago and up sharply
from January's $100.5 billion estimate.
   The new figures, contained in the administration's annual
midyear economic review, are based on the economic data that show
slower economic growth than the administration expected. The White
House now projects that the economy will grow by only 2.2 percent
this year _ down from the 2.6 percent it predicted in January.
   In gloomy remarks that appeared directed partly at congressional
budget negotiators, Darman spoke of ``across-the-board spending
reductions of a totally unprecedented size'' if the $100 billion
gap can't be bridged by a budget compromise.
   Added Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady: ``This problem is
serious. The law is the law. And we're going to obey it. ... This
is not a political wrestling match.''
   President Bush issued a written statement saying that in light
of the revised deficit estimate, ``it is, therefore, all the more
important that the budget summit reach agreement promptly and
Congress act responsibly to bring the deficit down.''
   Any cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law would be split 50-50 between
domestic and military spending. If Bush decides to include military
personnel in the defense cuts, one million men and women could be
removed from government payrolls, about half the force, Darman said.
   He gave these other examples of prospective cuts:
   _ Massive layoffs of air traffic controllers and the closing of
100 airport control towers, forcing sharp reductions in commercial
flights and ``an increase in traveler delays of 400 to 600
percent.''
   _ A halt to all new cleanups of toxic waste sites.
   _ Elimination of Pell grants to 1.2 million college students.
   _ A 40 percent reduction in Head Start enrollment for
pre-schoolers from poor families.
   _ A 140-day curtailment of meat and poultry inspections, sharply
reducing the supply of these products in supermarkets and driving
up prices.
   _ Sharp cuts in programs involving children's vaccinations, the
elderly, the war on drugs, and prisons.
   Despite Darman's warnings, few in the administration appeared to
believe that cuts of the scope of $100 billion would actually be
seen.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, told reporters that cuts in excess of $50 billion in one
year could be destabilizing and possibly tip the economy into a
recession.
   Boskin said to win the administration's support for a partial
easing of the Gramm-Rudman targets, Congress must agree to a
``successful, multiyear enforceable deficit reduction'' plan.
   Figuring in the 1991 costs of rescuing the troubled savings and
loan industry would add $62.6 billion to the total federal 1991
deficit, bringing it to a projected $231.4 billion, the
administration said.
   There is considerable sentiment both in Congress and the
administration to keep the costs of the savings and loan bailout
out of the official budget calculations.
   The administration blamed the sharp deterioration in the deficit
from January until now on the higher-than-expected S&amp;L bailout and
weaker economic growth that cuts into government revenues. It also
cited higher interest rates that boost the cost of servicing the
nation's $3 trillion national debt.
   The OMB projected a 4.8 percent rise in consumer prices this
year, matching last year'sinflation increase, but up from the
administration's estimate of a lower inflation figure of 4.4
percent.
   And it raised the government's projected cost of short-term
borrowing short-term by a full percentage point to 7.7 percent.

   An auto safety group asked the government
Monday to investigate and recall 5.5 million Chrysler cars and vans
after 76 reports of vehicles moving into gear while the
transmission was in park.
   The Center for Auto Safety said in a letter to National Highway
Traffic Safety Administrator Jerry Curry that two people had been
killed and 20 injured in accidents involving the problem with
several Chrysler models from 1981 to 1989.
   The center said the incidents indicate ``a pervasive and
dangerous defect.''
   NHTSA spokesman Tim Hurd said the agency had just received the
letter and would review it before deciding whether to open an
investigation. NHTSA conducts engineering analyses of vehicle
defects when officials determine that complaints warrant it.
   James Kenyon, spokesman for Chrysler Corp., said the company was
not aware of any problem with the models cited in the petition. He
said the company had not seen the complaint, which was sent to
members of the news media.
   The center, which describes itself as an independent consumer
group formed in 1970 to improve vehicle and highway safety, said
its petition covers 1981-89 Dodge Aries and Plymouth Reliants;
1982-87 Dodge 400s and Chrysler LeBarons; 1983-88 Dodge 600s,
Plymouth Caravelles and Chrysler New Yorkers; and 1984-89 Dodge
Caravans and Plymouth Voyagers.
   All of the cars share the same type of engine and transmission,
the center said.
   Deaths cited in the petition include that of Charles C. Davie of
Concord, N.H., who the center said died May 5, 1987, after he left
his 1985 Plymouth Reliant idling in park on a hill near his home.
The vehicle rolled down the hill, pinning Davie against a tree, the
center said.
   The other death noted in the petition occurred when a 1987 Dodge
600 moved backward into a woman the center identified as Agnes
Johnson, 92, of Brooklyn Center, Minn.

   General Electric Co. said Monday its
second quarter earnings jumped 12 percent due to increased sales of
aircraft engines, gas turbines and X-ray equipment.
   GE said in a statement the increase marks the 15th consecutive
quarter of double-digit earnings growth. The company is best known
to consumers as a manufacturer of major appliances and the owner of
the NBC Television Network.
   For the second quarter, its after-tax profit totaled $1.09
billion, or $1.22 a share, on revenue of $14.4 billion. That
compared with earnings of $972 million, or $1.08 a share, on
revenue of $13.5 billion in the same 1989 period.
   GE said it had a 12.9 percent operating margin, the best rate
ever achieved by GE in a quarter, GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr.
said. The previous all-time high was 12.1 percent in the same
quarter last year.
   GE's aircraft engine business, which had a $35 billion backlog
at the end of June, also received a $1.8 billion, 200-engine order
in the second quarter from Japan Air Lines. Spokesman Bruce Bunch
said the backlog means GE has enough orders to hold production for
five years.
   The company's power generation business, which makes turbines
and electrical equipment, also has seen an increase in sales,
especially in the gas turbine market.
   Sales of X-ray equipment in Europe and magnetic resonance
imaging equipment in the United States were up 15 percent compared
to 1989.
   Second quarter earnings jumped 16 percent over the same period
last year at GE Capital Corp., the financial subsidiary of GE.
   GE's transportation systems business received its largest export
order for locomotives in recent years, with a $168 million contract
from Mexico.
   GE's broadcasting business saw a drop in revenue for the second
quarter which the company attributed to ``market softness.''
   The company also makes plastic products, lighting, aerospace
equipment, industrial systems and motors and provides
communications services.
   For the first half, GE said it earned $2.04 billion, or $2.28 a
share, up 12 percent from $1.82 billion, or $2.02 a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the half rose 6 percent to $27.0 billion from $25.4
billion a year earlier.

   International Business Machines Corp. said
Monday its profit rose 5.2 percent in the second quarter as revenue
grew 8.4 percent, results that generally pleased industry analysts.
   ``Demand across our product line remains good worldwide,'' IBM
Chairman John F. Akers said. ``Revenue and earnings growth was led
by software, benefits from leasing activities and early results
from our restructuring actions.''
   The world's largest computer company said it earned $1.41
billion, or $2.45 a share, in the three months ended June 30, up
from $1.34 billion, or $2.31 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
to $16.49 billion from $15.21 billion.
   ``It was a very good quarter,'' said John Jones, who follows IBM
for Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco. ``They saw
(revenue) growth in all major geographic areas.''
   IBM, which makes and sells its products worldwide, derives more
than half its revenue from non-U.S. operations.
   About $300 million of IBM's second-quarter revenue stemmed from
favorable exchange rates in its overseas sales, analysts said. Last
year, a rise in the value of the dollar hurt IBM's financial
results.
   For the first half of the year, IBM had net income of $2.45
billion, or $4.26 a share, up 6.8 percent from $2.29 billion, or
$3.92 a share, in the first six months of 1989. Revenue grew 9.8
percent to $30.68 billion from $27.94 billion.
   IBM stock closed at $122.37{ a share, up $1.37{, in New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   In December, IBM announced a major restructuring in the face of
unexpectedly sluggish domestic market growth. Among other steps,
the Armonk, N.Y.-based company said it would trim its work force by
10,000 jobs and repurchase about $4 billion of its stock.
   IBM said the job cuts were expected to bring its U.S. work force
to 206,000 by the end of this year, down by more than 37,000 since
1985.
   IBM took a $2.3 billion pre-tax charge against 1989's
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for the restructuring.
   The company has been paring its operations since 1985, when
growth in the computer industry began slowing.
   Jones said IBM is just beginning to see the benefits from the
most recent employee reductions.
   ``Most of the results are going to be felt in the second half of
this year,'' he said. ``If they can keep revenue growing at 7 to 8
percent (a year), I don't think they'll need to downsize any more.''
   David Korus, a computer industry analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co., said IBM needs to keep on top of changing market conditions,
adjusting its operations to fit the industry.
   Jones said one potential future trouble spot is the company's
planned introduction of new high-end mainframe computers call the
Summit line.
   IBM is expected to announce the line sometime next year. Jones
said he expects the company in the meantime to announce new models
of its existing mainframes that can be upgraded to Summit models
once they are available.
   ``By doing that it will offset the normal reaction of customers
to stop buying before a major product rolls out the door,'' he said.
   But, he said, ``How that gets implemented will determine whether
they can grow through the product transition or take a temporary
slowing as their mainframe transition unfolds.''

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, facing possible criminal
charges for allegedly falsifying aircraft maintenance records, sent
a team of lawyers Monday to meet with federal prosecutors in
Brooklyn.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said he expected talks to continue
for at least several days. He declined to comment on whether a plea
bargain was in the works.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock in Miami also refused to say what
was being discussed.
   Martin R. Shugrue, Eastern's bankruptcy trustee, met June 1 with
Maloney in what one source described as an effort to head off
possible criminal charges. The source spoke to The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity.
   Shugrue reportedly is worried that any indictments would scare
away passengers and possibly torpedo his efforts to save the
strikebound airline.
   According to published reports, the grand jury is looking into
allegations that Eastern altered maintenance and safety records
early last year at three airports _ Kennedy International and La
Guardia in New York and Hartsfield International in Atlanta.
   Mechanics allegedly were ordered to disregard safety guidelines
and then falsified log books to show that proper checks were made.
   The investigation began last year after the Federal Aviation
Administration fined Eastern $839,000 for alleged maintenance
violations, primarily at Kennedy.
   The FAA regularly fines airlines for improper maintenance
practices, but does not seek criminal charges.
   Maloney said the filing of criminal charges against an airline
would be unprecedented.
   Eastern's Machinists union struck the airline March 4, 1989, and
the company filed for bankruptcy protection five days later. The
strike is continuing.
   A federal bankruptcy judge appointed Shugrue on April 18 to run
the airline in place of Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's
parent company, the former Texas Air Corp., now known as
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.

   GAF Corp. announced Monday that four banks
have agreed to provide the company $800 million in long-term
financing primarily to pay off debt incurred when a management
group bought out shareholders in March 1989.
   Banks involved in the agreement are Chase Manhattan Bank, the
Bank of New York, the Bank of Nova Scotia and the Banque Paribas,
of Paris.
   The refinancing arrangement is expected to be completed next
month, the specialty chemicals and building materials company said.
   A management group led by Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief
executive officer, paid $1.46 billion in the buyout.
   The refinancing will enable GAF to redeem $50 million of
outstanding senior subordinated increasing rate notes that are due
March 15, 1994, the company said in a statement.
   GAF will also be able to exchange new debentures for the
company's subordinated merger debentures, which shareholders
received in the buyout. The debentures and interest totalled $239
million as of June 30, the company said.
   GAF has not decided whether to make an exchange offer.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday ordered Eddie
Antar to turn over $73 million he made through his Crazy Eddie
electronics empire.
   Federal officials say the elusive fugitive, who has been missing
since he appeared in court Feb. 13, made the money through
fraudulent record keeping and insider trading at the now defunct
Crazy Eddie Inc.
   His assets in the United States have been frozen, but a deposit
of about $52 million had been made in an Israeli bank account, said
Richard Simpson, an attorney for the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Simpson said he could not estimate how much in U.S. assets have
been frozen and said the SEC is working through diplomatic channels
to freeze funds in Israel. He added that the SEC does not know how
much money, if any, may be in the Israeli bank account because the
money may have been transferred.
   Antar has missed several court dates on civil actions brought by
the SEC. U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan has ordered
federal marshals to hunt down the Brooklyn, N.Y.-bred businessman
and bring him to court.
   ``Eddie Antar's whereabouts are presently unknown, but I think
there's a 90 percent chance that they will become known at some
point,'' Simpson said. ``At that time we're going to make him pay
$73 million.''
   Antar's attorney, Justin N. Feldman of New York, said he could
not comment because he was not in court when the judgment against
his client was issued.
   Antar built a single outlet in New York into a chain with 43
stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Television and
radio commercials touted ``insane'' prices, and promised to beat
the deals of any of his competitors.

<TEXT>
   United Steelworkers of America
negotiators said Monday they are seeking authorization for 5,500
employees to strike Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel Corp. on Aug. 16.
   The negotiators unanimously approved a resolution to seek
permission from union President Lynn R. Williams for a strike over
terms of the company's bankruptcy reorganization plan, said Andrew
``Lefty'' Palm, director of USW District 15 and the union's chief
Wheeling-Pittsburgh negotiator.
   ``We have a pretty good idea that we will get authorization,''
Palm said at a news conference held in this Washington County
community.
   The request was to be presented by Tuesday to Williams, whose
approval is needed under union rules. An answer is expected within
a few days, Palm said.
   The workers' current contract was negotiated following a 98-day
work stoppage that began in 1985 after Wheeling-Pittsburgh filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy laws. It will expire 10 days after a plan of
reorganization is approved.
   The union's membership, unhappy with terms of the reorganization
plan, recently completed polling that gave negotiators the
authority to strike.
   The union claims the plan, supported in bankruptcy court by the
company and creditors, treats employee bankruptcy claims unfairly.
   Palm said the plan offers union members 13 percent of the value
of their stock, which is worth about $26 million. At the same time,
the average creditor would get 74 percent of the value of its
stock, he said.
   Palm said the workers made concessions in 1985 and lawyers for
the company and creditors are asking them to give up more than
their fair share under the reorganization plan.
   ``They've watched the bankruptcy lawyers for creditors and the
company raise fees by as much as $100 an hour,'' said Jim Smith, an
assistant to Williams. ``The cost of living is increasing for our
members too.''
   Galvie Gardner, president of Local 1187 in Allenport, Washington
County, said all the workers want is what other steel workers have.
   ``We give and give and give,'' he said. ``If we don't get it
we're on the street.''
   He was among 13 local presidents who stood behind Palm at the
news conference.
   Little progress was made when union negotiators last met with
the company June 12, Palm said. Wheeling-Pittsburgh spokesman Ray
Johnson said company negotiators are eager to resume talks.
   ``We'll do whatever we can to avoid a strike,'' Johnson said.
``That's why we're ready to meet at any time.''

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told the
Senate Monday he would recommend that President Bush veto the 1990
farm bill if its cost to the government is not reduced.
   The threat brought an immediate charge from Senate Agriculture
Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., that the Bush
administration was trying to kill the farm bill to have a freer
hand in international trade talks aimed at cutting agriculture
subsidies around the world.
   ``From a budget standpoint, the cost of the bill is excessive,''
Yeutter said in a letter that is deeply critical of the commodities
subsidies in the legislation expected to be taken up by the full
Senate this week.
   The committee has estimated that the commodity programs in the
bill would cost $55 billion over five years, but Yeutter said its
spending requirements amount to $59 billion.
   About $79 billion was spent over the last five years under the
1985 law expiring this year.
   The government subsidizes farmers who produce wheat, corn, rice,
cotton, soybeans, sugar, dairy products, wool and mohair, honey and
peanuts either by direct payment or manipulation of the market.
   ``The bill authorizes appropriations for a number of new
programs and authorities which could result in over $3 billion of
additional outlays,'' said Yeutter. His letter criticized every
government subsidy program in the Senate bill.
   Leahy said in a statement the administration had ``cooked up new
numbers'' in estimating the bill's impact on the budget.
   ``The reality is that the Senate farm bill is over $6 billion
less than what the president proposed in January for current
services,'' he said. ``The administration's veto threat is a thinly
veiled effort to kill the farm bill so the administration can cut a
back-room deal in Geneva, out of sight from American farmers.''
   Yeutter never mentioned the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade talks being conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, in his letter,
but criticized the bill as departing from the ``market-oriented''
approach of the 1985 law.
   The Bush administration's appeal to the countries covered by
GATT is that they allow the market to operate free of
price-distorting subsidies.
   ``America's farmers will see this for what it is, a strong-arm
effort to sabotage the farm bill suppported by a majority of both
Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Agricultture Committee,''
said Leahy.
   But Yeutter said, ``The instability of the commodity markets
dictates that we must consider the variability as well as the
absolute dollar estimate of spending for these programs.''

   A judge on Monday tossed out all charges
against Rite Aid Corp. and its president after ruling the evidence
against them in a bribery case was circumstantial.
   Martin L. Grass, 36, and Rite Aid were accused of bribing a
member of Ohio's Board of Pharmacy to resign so the panel would
have a makeup more favorable to the drugstore company.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian Greene granted a
defense motion asking for a judgment of acquittal after the
prosecution rested its case.
   Greene said prosecution evidence was circumstantial and did not
substantiate a case of willful intent to bribe.
   Some of the spectators in the courtroom gallery applauded and
several hugged the smiling Grass and congratulated him.
   Grass said he was sure he would be found innocent.
   ``I never had a doubt. It was a ridiculous prosecution,'' he
said.
   Grass and Rite Aid, based in Shiremanstown, Pa., were charged in
an indictment unsealed in August with bribery and possession of
criminal tools, described as a corporate aircraft.
   Both charges are felonies. The bribery charge is punishable by
up to 10 years in prison and a maximum fine of $5,000. The
possession of criminal tools charge carries a maximum sentence of
five years and a fine up to $2,500.
   Grass was accused of trying to bribe pharmacy board member
Melvin Wilczynski, 61, to step down so a new board member more to
Rite Aid's liking could be appointed.
   Grass gave Wilczynski a check worth more than $33,000. The
defense had argued the payment was in fact a legal buyout of
Wilczynski's consulting contract for another drug store company,
Lane Drug Co., a division of Peoples Drug Stores Inc. acquired by
Rite Aid last year.
   During the trial, which began July 9, prosecutors contended that
Grass offered the buyout only on condition that Wilczynski step
down as a voting member of the board. The government said Rite Aid
had complained the pharmacy board harassed the company when
enforcing state regulations over drugstores.
   Defense attorneys have said the state pharmacy board had a
vendetta against Rite Aid because it challenged some rules and
decisions which it thought were unreasonable.
   The prosecutors had the jury hear and watch two secretly-made
tapes _ a recorded telephone conversation between Wilczynski and
Grass on April 26, 1989, and a videotape the following day in a
hotel room near Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.
   Grass was arrested at the hotel room.
   In the telephone tape, Wilczynski is heard arranging the
following-day meeting with Grass at the hotel to discuss the
contract buyout and Rite Aid's provision of health insurance after
the buyout.
   In the videotape, Wilczynski and Grass are seen in the motel
room, leafing through papers, some of which Wilczynski signs.
   Prosecutors said the papers included six undated letters of
resignation, addressed to Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste, from which
Wilczynski was supposed to select for signing.
   Wilczynski remains a voting member of the pharmacy board, which
oversees drugstores' adherence to state rules.
   Celeste has said he knew of no plans to get any Rite Aid
officials or supporters appointed to the pharmacy board.
   Before the trial began, Greene dismissed as evidence three other
taped conversations which the prosecution wanted to use. The judge
said they were made by pharmacy board investigators, who did not
have jurisdiction in the criminal case. The two tapes that were
allowed were made by Cuyahoga County sheriff's officers.

   Supporters of a balanced budget amendment to
the Constitution said Monday they were short of the votes needed to
win House passage.
   ``We're not doing as well as I'd hoped right now,'' said Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas.
   However, Stenholm said he and other supporters were lobbying
hard and expected to come closer than ever Tuesday to the required
two-thirds majority.
   President Bush sent a letter to Capitol Hill urging support of
the amendment and calling for a line-item veto and greater
authority for the president to impound funds.
   ``Together with political courage and discipline, these tools
are vital to solving the problem of budget deficits,'' Bush said.
He called the balanced budget amendment ``crucial to our nation's
long-term economic health and properity.''
   Stenholm, prime Democratic sponsor of the amendment, said he was
about 18 votes short of victory but that there were enough
undecided votes to put it over the top.
   The amendment, if approved by a two-thirds vote of the Congress
and three-fourths of the states, would ban the government from
spending more than it takes in unless three-fifths of the Congress
voted to waive the requirement.
   The balanced budget rules would not take effect before fiscal
1993, and would be set aside in time of war.
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, said he would try to change the
amendment to require a super-majority vote also to raise taxes
above the rate of growth in national income.
   The House last voted on a balanced budget amendment in 1982; it
fell short by more than 40 votes.
   The House Democratic leadership opposes the amendment.
   ``Members as always are trying to reach for simple answers to
what are very tough problems,'' said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee. ``I've never seen a process
change in the world that is going to produce the courage and guts
you need to make tough choices.
   ``Some of my colleagues will find it a refuge,'' he said. ``I
think we have a very good chance of beating the amendment.''

<HEAD>CBOT Chief's Firm Ordered To Adjust Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The commodities trading firm headed by Chicago
Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said Monday it is seeking
an outside investor and parceling out some accounts to get its
books in order.
   The firm, Stotler and Co., has been directed by the Board of
Trade to bring its amount of cash-on-hand up to 4 percent of
customer funds, as required by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, by the close of business Wednesday, according to a
statement issued by the firm's parent company, Stotler Group Inc.
   If a brokerage does not maintain the required amount of capital,
the exchange can restrict the brokerage to trading only for the
purpose of liquidation and can transfer that brokerage's customer
accounts to other firms, said Michael O'Connell, a Board of Trade
spokesman.
   He referred questions about the specifics of the case to
Chicago-based Stotler Group, where spokesman Vito Piazza declined
to comment beyond the prepared statement.
   The statement said Stotler planned to meet the requirement by
transferring a portion of its customer accounts and stake in the
market to other brokerages and by seeking ``a capital infusion from
various parties.''
   The moves are likely to reduce the firm's revenue and net
income, Stotler said.
   ``Without a capital infusion, Stotler Group may be unable to
meet its debt obligations unless those obligations are refinanced
or restructured,'' the company said.
   The Chicago Tribune reported Saturday that Stotler, one of the
nation's 10 biggest futures brokerages, may have run afoul of
capital requirements because of its recent rapid growth.
   Stotler Group said another subsidiary brokerage, R.G. Dickinson
&amp; Co. of Des Moines, Iowa, was not affected by the compliance
problems at Stotler and Co.
   Mahlman is serving his fourth consecutive one-year term as
chairman of the BOT. Stotler is one of the nation's 10 largest
futures brokers.

<HEAD>Examiner Finds Legal Action Could Result From Revco LBO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outside examiner appointed by a federal
bankruptcy judge to look into the 1986 junk-bond financed buyout of
Revco D.S. Inc. said Monday he believes successful lawsuits could
arise from the deal.
   However, the examiner, Barry L. Zaretsky, said lawsuits should
not be filed to avoid interfering with bankruptcy court proceedings.
   ``Our preliminary finding that the Revco (leveraged buyout)
amounted to a fraudulent conveyance is likely to lead to greater
scrutiny of the financial condition of junk bond-financed deals,''
said Zaretsky, who was appointed examiner by U.S. Bankruptcy Court
Judge Harold F. White last month.
   Zaretsky said his examination has not found actual fraud, but
that the deal was made with either fraudulent intent or without
fair consideration of whether the company could pay its debts.
   The examiner also said state law tort claims and other actions
could arise from the buyout.
   Zaretsky is a Brooklyn Law School professor and counsel to the
New York-based law firm of Kelly Drye &amp; Warren.
   Revco went from a publicly held company to a private one during
a $1.5 billion, management-led leveraged buyout.
   The Revco buyout failed in 1988. Revco's was the first major
debt-financed buyout to seek protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   This year the suburban Cleveland-based drugstore chain, one of
the country's largest, decided to sell more than 700 of its 2,000
stores in order to concentrate on eastern operations, where sales
are strongest.
   The appointment of an examiner was requested by U.S. Trustee
Conrad J. Morgenstern, who supervised the Revco bankruptcy case.
