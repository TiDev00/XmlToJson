   State legislators met Tuesday with four
of 200 students on the seventh day of their sit-in to protest
conditions at East Tennessee State University.
   Rep. Roscoe Dixon, chairman of the Legislature's black caucus,
said three of the school's administrators and three of the student
protesters agreed to meet to resolve the impasse.
   The caucus met with four of the protesting students from the
historically black school. The students, who began the sit-in last
Wednesday, said they are protesting dilapidated classrooms and
dormitories.
   ``I wouldn't allow my pet dog to live in the dormitories out
there,'' said Sen. John Ford, a member of the caucus.
   Ford said $60 million was added to the Nashville school's
operating budget a few years ago, ``but essentially a lot of things
have not been done.''
   ``It's going to take a lot of time,'' he said. ``You can't tear
down a dormitory in one day. The process is slow and long.''
   Some of the protesters have left the sit-in periodically to
attend classes.
   The university has an enrollment of 3,800 students.

   A man sat in an all-night restaurant for
three hours Tuesday before drawing a pistol without warning,
shooting an employee to death and critically wounding a customer,
police said.
   Police shot and killed Clifford James Harper, 39, when he
stepped out of the 4B's Restaurant and ignored repeated orders to
drop his weapon, said police Chief Don Millhouse.
   ``The first thing I heard was the police yelling `freeze,'''
said Paul Richards, who was spending the night at a cultural center
a half a block away. ``There was some type of guttural response ...
then pop, pop, real quick shots.''
   Harper used a .41-caliber Magnum pistol to kill George Loewen,
64, who had been vacuuming the restaurant, and to wound Larry
Lacock, 40, a customer sitting at the counter, Millhouse said.
   Lacock, hit in both arms and grazed across the chest, was
initially listed in critical condition at St. Patrick Hospital, but
his condition was upgraded to good following surgery Tuesday
evening, said an evening supervisor who condition of anonymity.
   Harper had been staying in a motel in this secluded college town
of 35,000 in western Montana, Millhouse said. He apparently entered
the restaurant about 1 a.m. and stayed three hours.
   Two police officers and a Missoula County sheriff's deputy
confronted Harper when he exited the restaurant, Millhouse said.
Despite several warnings, Harper advanced and continued pointing
his weapon at the officers, who shot him, the police chief said.
   The shooting was justified, and no criminal charges will be
filed, said Fred Van Valkenburg, a deputy county attorney.

<TEXT>
   Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan says he
is no enemy of white people or the Jews, but he claims the U.S.
government has plotted to kill him, according to an interview
published Thursday.
   ``To say that Louis Farrakhan is antisemitic is an unfair
characterization of me,'' he said in an interview with The
Washington Post.
   Farrakhan, leader of the 10,000-member black organization who
has given few interviews, has been criticized for his outspoken
views, particularly about Jews and Israel. In his interview, he
said his statements have been distorted by the news media.
   ``Louis Farrakhan is not an enemy of America, not an enemy of
Jews, not an enemy of white people,'' he said.
   Asked about a 1984 statement in which he was reported to have
called Judiasm a ``dirty religion,'' Farrakhan said he was
``referring to the actions of the stte of Israel using God and
religion as a cover for what I said was lying, stealing, murder.''
   ``And I said ... that Jews, some of them, practice dirty
religion; some Muslems practice dirty religion; some Christians
practice dirty religion, and that's why we're in America in the
condition that we're in,'' he said.
   A city council resolution last year honoring anti-drug efforts
of the Nation of Islam at a Washington housing project was
criticized by Jewish groups as an implicit endorsement of
Farrakhan's views.
   Farrakhan accused the government of orchestrating the
assassinations of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. He
said the federal government had plotted to kill him and that the
CIA and other government operatives harass him both in and out of
the country.
   He was not specific, and said those operatives will meet the
wrath of a ``higher power.''

   There's a new park planned downtown _ but it will
be so temporary they might rent the trees.
   ``This just sounds crazy,'' City Councilwoman Jane Noland said
Monday after Metro officials briefed the council on their plans to
spend $400,000 to $600,000 to build a temporary park at a bus
station entrance.
   Metro, the regional agency that operates the transit and sewer
systems for Seattle and surrounding King County, has used the
privately owned 144,000-square-foot property for the past three
years to store equipment during construction of a bus tunnel. It
received permission from the city to do so with the understanding
that once construction was completed, the block would be made
presentable.
   Intrawest Corp., which wants to build a retail and office
building on the site, recently took an option to buy the land from
Marathon U.S. Realty Inc. Metro officials say landscaping the
property into a park is one of the cheapest ways to spruce up the
land until Intrawest gets the city permits it needs and is ready to
build.
   Because it's not clear how long that might take, Metro is
considering leasing the trees that will be in the park.
   ``We'll just send 'em back when the park moves,'' said Gary
Hartnett, a design consultant.
   Robert Holmes, Intrawest president and chief executive officer,
said he hopes to start construction early next year. But City
Councilman Jim Street said it could be two years or more before the
city gives its go-ahead.

   A state social worker has been cleared of a
charge of failing to report suspected abuse in the weeks before a
2-year-old was fatally thrust headfirst into a toilet for soiling
his pants.
   Judge Jesse Barber on Tuesday threw out the misdemeanor charge
against Kenneth Houk, saying the prosecution hadn't proved its
case. Barber granted the acquittal two hours into the trial and
before the defense even presented its side.
   Houk was the first of three Florida Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services workers to be tried in the case arising
from the death of Bradley McGee.
   ``It's over,'' said Houk, who had faced up to 60 days in jail if
convicted. ``I don't even want to think about it anymore.''
   Prosecutors contended Houk twice failed to notify the state
child abuse registry after receiving reports about Bradley's case.
The last call came weeks before the toddler's July 28 death from
head injuries when the child was repeatedly thrust into a toilet
for soiling his pants, authorities said.
   Bradley's mother and stepfather _ Sheryl McGee Coe, 21, and
Thomas Coe, 22, of Lakeland _ face trial this summer on murder and
aggravated child abuse charges.
   Bradley was abandoned at a shopping mall when he was 3 months
old and lived most of his life in foster care until the state gave
him back to the mother and stepfather two months before his death.
   The prosecution's case hinged on a July 3 report relayed to Houk
in which a family friend said Bradley's mother had forced the child
to eat feces for violating potty training.
   Theresa Jacobs, a prosecution witness who originally reported
the feces complaint, told the jury Houk had urged her numerous
times to telephone the child abuse registry when she had something
to report.
   She said she didn't follow his advice because she ``never got
any satisfaction from the registry.'' She also said she did not
have firsthand knowledge of the alleged abuse.
   Case worker Judy Ross was called by the state to confirm reports
that she relayed the feces complaint to Houk. But she wavered when
asked whether she thought such a secondhand report warranted a call
to the HRS hotline.
   After the acquittal, defense attorney Jack Wilkins said,
``Hopefully this will lead to a different wording of the law. ...
People who work for HRS must be given the freedom to make judgment
calls.''
   Assistant State Attorney John Aguero stalked out of the
courtroom, refusing to comment.
   Case workers Margaret Barber and Shirley Duboise also are
charged with failing to report child abuse. Ms. Barber, who had
been assigned the Bradley case, also is charged with child abuse,
which carries up to five years in prison.

   Could Rhett Butler pin ``Nature Boy'' Ric Flair?
Could Dorothy put the Wicked Witch of the West in a half-Nelson?
   Wrestling fans may be betting on such questions if Jim Herd,
executive vice president of World Championship Wrestling Inc., gets
permission from his boss, media mogul Ted Turner, to borrow
wrestlers' names from classic films.
   Turner owns both the wrestling organization and the rights to
such movies as ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Gone With the Wind.''
   ``That would be a plus if we had characters patterned after
these larger-than-life individuals,'' Herd said Tuesday at the new
$2 million World Championship Wrestling post-production studio in
Turner's CNN Center.
   Herd said his first attempt would be to have Long John Silver,
the one-legged buccaneer of ``Treasure Island,'' swagger into the
ring.
   ``I personally think we should approach wrestling from a
historical viewpoint,'' Herd said. ``If I find a 270-pound,
6-foot-5 one-legged wrestler, I'd have Long John Silver.''
   Turner was out of town Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment, but Herd said he thinks he'll go for the idea. ``He's told
me personally he likes what he's seeing, and if he doesn't, he'll
say so,'' he said.
   Herd isn't worried that controversy, similar to that engendered
when Turner began colorizing black-and-white films, could erupt
over use of the fictional characters.
   ``We introduce controversy every day,'' Herd said. ``And Robert
Louis Stevenson won't get mad at us.''
   The four hours of wrestling on Turner Broadcasting System's
cable Superstation each week are among TBS' highest rated programs,
Herd said.
   With the studio, WCW will improve the production quality of its
wrestling programs to ``compete in today's glitzy atmosphere'' and
do interviews with wrestlers to ``let fans see their human side,''
he said.
   The new facility, complete with wrestlers' dressing rooms,
replaced dubbing studios in Charlotte, N.C., and Dallas and
contains state-of-the-art equipment to provide programming to 178
TV stations.
   The studio and WCW's ``human'' approach will help the company
gain a projected $60 million share of the $300 million wresting
industry in 1990, Herd said.

<TEXT>
   A developer that illegally bulldozed more than
1,500 soil-conserving mangrove trees to make way for a
marina-condominium project could be fined up to $25,000 per tree,
or $37.5 million, officials said.
   The mangroves, which play a vital role in Florida's rapidly
disappearing wetlands, occupied a 1,700-foot stretch along a
drainage ditch next to Dumfounding Bay, part of the Intracoastal
Waterway north of Miami.
   ``This is probably the largest mangrove destruction case in Dade
County history,'' said Robert Karafel, a code enforcement officer
for 17 years.
   The bulldozing was discovered Jan. 25 after an anonymous tip to
the Metro-Dade Department of Environmental Resources, authorities
said Monday.
   Officials at Glendale Federal Bank, backers of the project, do
not deny the bulldozing and said they are trying to resolve the
situation. Glendale is responsible for any penalty, Karafel said.
   ``Even though we don't believe some of the mangroves were
significant to the ecosystem, we recognize they were removed
illegally,'' said Stanley Price, an attorney for the thrift. ``It's
just an unfortunate event, it really is.''
   One settlement under discussion would have Glendale pay a fine,
reimburse the agency for administrative costs and plant 22,680
mangrove seedlings.
   The mangroves, which grow along salt water, create land by
trapping soil and provide a haven for sea life in its roots. The
trees are best known for their curly above-ground root system and
grow to about 25 feet high.
   ``In maybe 25 years, you might see what was destroyed,'' Karafel
said. ``When you cut off that food source, it has longstanding
impact on the entire food chain in the bay.''
   The contractor, Ryan Construction Co. of Sessner, had a permit
to clear only 100 feet of mangroves, the thrift said. In all, about
1,890 trees were destroyed, including some buttonwoods, inspectors
said.

<TEXT>
   Egypt is combining old photographs
and American high technology in the most comprehensive
save-the-Sphinx campaign in 3,400 years.
   Such an ambitious project was last undertaken in ancient Egypt's
New Kingdom after _ legend has it _ a young prince fell asleep in
the shadow of the Sphinx and heard it whisper: ``Save me.''
   The new campaign, announced this week by Culture Minister Farouk
Hosni, follows years of delay and disagreement over how to save the
crumbling monument, a half-man, half-lion sculpted 4,600 years ago.
   The Egyptian Antiquities Organization launched an emergency
conservation project last year to remove and replace concrete
blocks and mortar from the Sphinx's front paws and haunches.
   The new project combines the Egyptians' restoration work with
modern monitoring equipment from the United States to discover why
the Sphinx is deteriorating and what to do about it.
   Protective wooden scaffolding already climbs from the statue's
chest to the top of its cobra-adorned headdress. The famous
piercing eyes and subtle smile barely show through.
   ``I must find a way to save it,'' said Sayed Tawfik, Egyptian
antiquities chairman, inspecting the monument Tuesday. ``Not just
for my lifetime, but for the next 2,000 years.''
   Tawfik contacted the Getty Conservation Institute, which
provided the monitoring equipment. The Marina Del Ray, Calif.
institute will pay about $200,000 for a year of monitoring and pick
up some of the preservation costs.
   ``People, institutions, everybody was afraid to touch the
Sphinx, afraid they'd be blamed if something went wrong,'' Tawfik
said. ``We have a nickname for it, `Father of Terror.' Everybody
was terrified to help us, because the Sphinx is so big and so
famous.
   Luis Monreal, the Getty institute's director, said he's ready
for the challenge.
   ``You have to imagine that although the Sphinx has been around
almost 5,000 years, it's been covered with sand for all but about
500,'' he said. Since the Sphinx was last uncovered in 1925, it
``has been exposed to the modern world 24 hours a day.''
   ``We cannot return the Sphinx to the way it would have looked to
the pharaohs, but we are confident we can return it to the pristine
look it had in 1925, if that's the look the Egyptians want.''
   A 200-pound, 6{-foot-tall meteorological station will be perched
atop the Sphinx's back, anchored by sandbags. Capable of recording
data for one year, the solar-powered monitor will record traffic
vibrations, changes in moisture, temperature and wind direction and
the effects of sand, salt, water and earthquakes.
   Erosion has gutted almost every part of the mammoth limestone
statue, and experts predict the decay will increase dramatically as
Cairo's 14 million population continues to expand.
   The first major campaign to save the Sphinx was the project of
the young prince who later became Pharaoh Tuthmosis IV. Asleep in
the shadow of the sand-covered Sphinx, traditon holds that he saw
the beast come to him in a dream and heard its promise to lead him
to the throne if he would free it.
   After he became pharaoh, Tuthmosos had his artisans restore the
statue. About 1,400 years later, Greeks and Romans also repaired
the sacred Sphinx with small blocks similiar to those the Egyptians
are inserting today.
   Monreal said his team has gathered the available literature on
the Sphinx's history including all restoration attempts and ideas
on how to save it.
   He has collected photographs from as early as the mid-1800s,
when only the Sphinx's head protruded from the sand. He said the
pictures will enable the team to create a computer model of what
has happened, when, what could happen and what can be done about it.
   The important thing, Monreal said, is ``the Egyptians have
decided the Sphinx must be saved. We agree.''

   The Miss USA beauty pageant got under way
Tuesday evening as 51 contestants flashing bright smiles and
sporting mid-winter tans competed in swimsuits and evening gowns.
   About 3,000 people gathered at Century II's Convention Hall for
the competition by contestants from all 50 states and the District
of Columbia.
   Each category contributes a third of the score that will
determine the 12 finalists, who will be announced Friday in a
national telecast of the pageant on CBS. The other third will come
from personal interviews with an 11-judge panel.
   In Tuesday night's opening, the contestants _ all wearing short,
black cocktail dresses _ sang about being ``right in the middle''
of the United States as they danced and strutted in front of a U.S.
map with Wichita marked with a neon star.
   Contestants said hello to the audience with brief statements,
many of them on their aspirations. Two contestants said they wanted
to someday win the Academy Award for best actress; nearly a dozen
said they are planning careers as broadcast journalists or
television personalities. One contestant who survived an automobile
crash endorsed seat belts.
   In the swimsuit competition, contestants wore identical pink,
one-piece suits. They posed in front of a neon rainbow with puffy
clouds projected behind it as the Top 40 song ``Blame It on The
Rain'' played.
   Two preliminary awards were announced.
   Photographers covering the pageant picked Miss Mississippi-USA
Stephanie TenEyck as 1990's most photogenic delegate. She is a
20-year-old University of Mississippi student from Laurel, Miss.
   Miss Minnesota-USA, Janet Tveita, was selected by a vote of all
the contestants as the nicest, most enthusiastic and friendliest of
the 51 women. She is a 21-year-old from Brooklyn Park, Minn., and
attends North Hennepin Community College.
   Judges for this year's pageant include former Olympian and
professional ice skater Robin Cousins and retired astronaut Gordon
Cooper.
   The pageant finals hosts will be Dick Clark and Leeza Gibbons,
co-host of the syndicated television show ``Entertainment Tonight.''

   A screenwriter who claims his ideas
were stolen for the movie ``Harlem Nights'' has filed a $35 million
lawsuit against Eddie Murphy, who lost a similar case in January
over ``Coming to America.''
   Michael Greene, 35, charged Tuesday that ``Harlem Nights''
contains material lifted from a screenplay Greene wrote for Murphy
called ``A Halloween to Remember.''
   When he saw ``Harlem Nights'' in November, he was astounded at
the similarities _ some 100 in all, Greene said.
   ``My film was a lot better than what was made,'' he added.
   Both scripts were about 8-year-old orphans being raised by
underworld characters, both were set in the 1930s and both had a
corrupt Italian plainclothes cop _ Sgt. Pallone in Greene's version
and Sgt. Cantone in the movie, Greene said.
   Named as defendants in the suit are Murphy, Paramount Pictures
Corp., the William Morris Agency and Steven Weiss.
   A lawyer for Paramount, Les Fagen, denied the charge of
copyright infringement, saying the scripts contained motifs common
to hundreds of movies.
   Greene said he submitted his script to Murphy in January 1989
and was advised it had been rejected. The script was never
returned, he said.
   In January, a judge ruled that Paramount Pictures had to pay
humorist Art Buchwald for a script idea he claimed was the basis
for Murphy's hit 1988 movie ``Coming to America.'' The amount of
the payment has not been settled.

   A former mayor says he rues the day he
dedicated a city park in the name of Kirk Douglas, who described
Amsterdam as a ``dirty mill town'' in his 1988 autobiography.
   ``I will go to my grave regretting my part in putting a park in
his honor here,'' Mario Villa, a city ward supervisor, said Monday.
   Kirk Douglas Park was dedicated in a 1985 ceremony attended by
Douglas and thousands of well-wishers, including Villa, then mayor.
   In ``The Ragman's Son,'' Douglas says his neighbors in the town
near Albany discriminated against him when he was growing up here
because he was the son of poor Russian Jewish immigrants. Douglas
claimed he was beaten and denied jobs because he was Jewish.
   Villa said the claims of discrimination were false, and he
decried Douglas as ``nothing but a hollow, phony individual'' with
little concern for his hometown.
   Douglas' book already had drawn criticism from residents of this
town of 22,000. In a letter recently to The Recorder, the daily
newspaper in Amsterdam, Douglas refused to retract anything he
wrote.

   No man is a hero to his parking valet,
especially if he's a congressman.
   ``Politicians are the worst tippers,'' says Adam Greenberg, an
American University student who earns living expenses as a parking
valet for black-tie galas and Georgetown dinner parties several
nights every week.
   ``They drive up and say, `I'm a congressman _ park it close.'
They go to five parties a night, stay for 15 minutes and leave. I
guess they only have so much money to go around for tips,'' he says.
   Greenberg is one of about 170 part-time employees _ most of them
college students _ who hustle cars for Atlantic Valet Parking,
which handles more than 1,000 Washington social events to the tune
of $1 million each year.
   It's tough work, waiting outside for hours in rain, snow and
numbing winds, only to be stiffed by an abusive drunk whose
Mercedes wasn't purring at the front door the moment he staggers
out.
   ``Then surprise _ along comes an old Chevy Nova who pulls out a
ten-spot,'' says Marty Janis, the company's 26-year-old executive
director and part owner, who got his start as a valet parker during
his senior year at Georgetown University six years ago.
   Finding a safe, nearby place to park in a hurry isn't the
valet's only worry, Janis said.
   Although car keys are kept on a locator board at big parties to
avoid mishaps, an occasional key is lost or misplaced in the rush.
It becomes a nightmare when the missing keys belong to a VIP, which
happened to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and former
Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara.
   ``It was very late, and McNamara wasn't at all happy,'' Janis
said. ``We drove him home, got his spare keys and went back. When
our guys finally delivered his car, he thanked them and gave them a
big tip.''
   Janis gets headaches from limousine chauffeurs who block
traffic, and high anxiety from little fender scrapes.
   ``It's always a lawyer's car, and they'll kill you,'' he says.
``They'll sue for everything, including mental strain.''
   Atlantic, the biggest valet parking company in Washington,
handles everything from glitzy charity balls for 3,000 guests to
one dinner party where the hosts invited another couple and, eager
to impress, hired a valet to park their car.
   Greenberg, a two-year veteran who works as many as four parties
a week, receives a $5 hourly wage and averages $10 in tips for a
night's work.
   Valet parkers are instructed to obey parking regulations at all
times. Joyriding is forbidden. So is shoving out a hand for a tip.
They are coached to respond to cursing with a courteous smile and
an apology. And they must run _ never walk _ to retrieve a car.
   ``They're trained to drive slow and run fast,'' Janis says.
   For all its drawbacks, says Greenberg, ``it's a great job _
flexible hours, good exercise, good money and plenty of
entertainment.''
   They might glimpse Prince Charles or Brooke Shields at a
black-tie banquet. Or watch well-heeled, well-oiled couples
fighting over the keys to drive home. Or shake hands with a tipsy
Tip O'Neill, the former House speaker who once rolled out of a
party and grandly introduced himself to every parking valet on the
sidewalk.
   One of their favorites is Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who
hires them for parties at his suburban Virginia home overlooking
the Potomac River.
   ``Sen. Kennedy always talks to us if he can, and he makes sure
we get a bite to eat while we're waiting outside,'' Greenberg said.
``He's one of the best hosts in town.''
   Janis recalls one woman who arrived without an escort for an
elegant bash, and left her car with a valet.
   ``The guy was looking for a parking space on the street when the
car phone rang. He picked it up and said, `Hello,' and a man's
voice said, `Who's this?' He answered, `The valet parker.' The man
said, `Oh, yeah, sure.' Then CLICK.''
   ``When we told the lady who owned the car, she laughed,'' Janis
said. ``She said, `Oh, that must have been my husband. I came alone
because we just had a big fight.'''

   Both President-elect Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro and the Sandinistas demanded Tuesday that the Contra
rebels immediately disband, but the defeated ruling party set tough
conditions for a peaceful transition of power.
   ``The causes that started the civil war in Nicaragua have
disappeared,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a radio broadcast. ``That's
why those who took to the hills should now lay down their guns and
return peacefully to Nicaragua with their families to work for the
reconstruction of our motherland.''
   Earlier, the top Contra leader, Israel Galeano, said from
Tegucigalpa, Honduras, that the rebels would not disband until
after Mrs. Chamorro is inaugurated April 25 for a six-year term.
   The Sandinistas, defeated two days early by an opposition
coalition in a stunnign upset, insisted Tuesday that industries
remain nationalized, land seized from largeholders remain in
peasant hands and the U.S.-bcked Contras disband immediately.
   ``A change of government does not mean the end of the
revolution,'' President Daniel Ortega told a cheering crowd of
thousands after a meeting of Sandinista party leaders.
   He read a statement from the party leadership that said it would
turn power over to the United National Opposition (UNO) but still
had ``the responsibility to watch over and guarantee the continuity
of the revolutionary process.''
   Ortega's speech came before the chiefs of both sides' transition
teams had their first meeting. Former President Jimmy Carter, who
is acting as a mediator for Ortega and Mrs. Chamorro, also attended.
   The private, pro-coalition Radio Corp. said working session were
to begin Wednesday.
   Mrs. Chamorro accused the Sandinistas of using state Radio
Sandino to stir up the population, referring to the station's
transmission Monday of hundreds of calls from supporters who
expressed opposition to her victory.
   She said she agreed with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, who
asked the news media during a Mass to publicize the idea of
``reconciliation because if they don't, God save Nicaragua.''
   In a radio broadcast later, Mrs. Chamorro called for the
``immediate demobilization'' of the rebels and promised to respect
the rights of the roughly 40 percent of the electorate that voted
for the Sandinistas.
   The Sandinista statement said the party, as the strongest, most
cohesive political force in the country, would oppose any change in
its agrarian reform, nationalization of banks and foreign trade.
   The statement also demanded the jobs of all public workers be
guaranteed.
   Privatization is a fundamental part of UNO's economic program.
The opposition hopes to reduce the public sector and return
inefficient state-owned industries to the private sector.
   The statement also said the Sandinistas would ``defend the
integrity and professionalism of the army and the police forces.''
   Control of military and police forces is considered the most
delicate issue in negotiating a transfer of power. They are closely
identified with the Sandinista party, and the army is known as the
Sandinista People's Army, not the Nicaraguan army.
   UNO has promised to eliminate the draft and reduce the size of
the armed forces.
   Sandinista officials have insisted they cannot give up control
of the army or the police until the guerrilla war, financed mainly
by the former Reagan administration, is definitively ended.
   Carter told reporters he believed the Sandinista concerns about
the Contras and the military were reasonable.
   ``They have expressed their conviction that this has got to be
done before they are willing in effect to leave the country
defenseless or to turn over their ability to defend the country
from an attacking army from Honduras. I think this is a reasonable
statement of fact, it's not an ultimatum or demand,'' said Carter.
   After he read his statement, Ortega emphasized that the party
planned to turn over the reins of power to UNO, but said UNO voters
would soon discover their mistake.
   ``Everyone who voted for UNO will vote for the (Sandinista)
Front in the future,'' he said. ``The ball is in the other court.''
   UNO officials seemed unworried by Ortega's speech.
   ``Like we say here, this is just the drowning man kicking. But
we're not worried about it. Even though it's not in our hands (to
demobilize the Contras), there are ways, political ways, to let
them know how we feel,'' said Gilberto Cuadra, a Chamorro adviser
and prominent businessman.
   Azucena Ferrey, a former member of the Contra directorate, also
seemed unconcerned about demobilization. ``There's no problem with
that,'' she said.
   But Galeano said the Contras wouldn't disband until after the
inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, publisher of the opposition
newspaper La Prensa.
   ``We are a cancer that no one wants. That is why we should act
with caution,'' said Galeano.
   Carter, however, said he was trying to help the parties define
the issues and find a common ground.
   At the transition team meeting, Mrs. Chamorro's son-in-law and
campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo, led her team and Ortega's brother
Humberto, the defense minister, led the Sandinista team, Radio
Corp. reported.
   Carter said prior to the meeting that Humberto Ortega, and
Interior Minister Tomas Borge, in charge of police forces, had
agreed to give up their posts.
   One concern for UNO, he said, was that the Sandinista army is
written into the constitution, and UNO will be several votes short
of a two-third majority, even if they maintain their unity.
   Complete elections results for the National Assembly were not in
but the pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario said it estimated
UNO would win 52 seats, the Sandinistas 38 and the Social Christian
party one.
   As the defeat of Ortega sinked in Tuesday, about 15,000
Sandinista loyalists showed up in front of the Olof Palme
Convention Center after word spread that 1,500 Sandinista national,
regional and local leaders were meeting.
   ``We will give up the government, but not our weapons,'' said
Lester Rivera, a member of the Sandinista Youth.
   The general election was monitored by more than 3,000
international observers, including the United Nations, the
Organization of American States and a delegation led by Carter.
They all pronounced the voting free and fair and the count clean.
   According to the latest preliminary returns, Mrs. Chamorro took
55 percent of the vote to Ortega's 40 percent with 82 percent of
the precincts counted.

<HEAD>AARP Argues Against Cutting Social Security Taxes Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest organization of older Americans
says an ill-timed cut in Social Security taxes could destroy
confidence in the pension system and make it harder to reduce the
federal deficit.
   But unless government officials can significantly reduce the
deficit, a tax cut may be a good idea once Social Security
surpluses are sufficient to cover benefits for 18 to 24 months, the
American Association of Retired Persons said Tuesday.
   AARP and two smaller organizations of senior citizens agreed in
testimony before the Senate Finance Committee that the government
must stop using surplus Social Security taxes to hide the size of
the overall deficit.
   The House Ways and Means Committee took a step in that direction
Tuesday by recommending that Social Security revenues not be
considered when the overall deficit is calculated.
   The Finance Committee is considering a bill by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would reduce Social Security taxes
for workers and employers so that surpluses could no longer be
available to mask the deficit.
   ``The current system creates the illusion that the (Social
Security) surplus can be used to pay for general government
expenditures,'' said Lawrence T. Smedley, executive director of the
National Council of Senior Citizens. ``In a word, the current
budget system is dishonest.''
   Smedley said taxes could be cut once reserves are sufficient to
cover 15 to 18 months of benefits, which probably would not be
before 1993.
   Martha McSteen, president of the National Committee to Preserve
Social Security and Medicare, said that since the budget is
unlikely to be balanced soon, the other way to keep government from
spending surplus Social Security taxes is to eliminate them with a
tax cut.
   ``It's much like getting rid of the ice cream and doughnuts
before you go on a diet,'' she said. ``You remove the temptation
and force yourself to make tough decisions.''
   AARP Director Judith N. Brown told the Finance Committee that
cutting Social Security taxes ``just when the system is building
needed reserves could weaken public confidence and support.'' But
she said a tax cut may be advisable once the reserves are built up,
so Social Security revenues aren't used to reduce the deficit.
   She said that unless other taxes were raised or spending cut to
make up for the $55 billion a year that Moynihan's bill would lose,
the overall deficit would rise, further increasing government debt
and slowing the economy.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan advised against cutting
Social Security taxes or taking the system out of the budget.
   ``The current structure of Social Security may not be
appropriate in all circumstances,'' he said. ``But, at present, it
is still the best option.''
   Greenspan said proposals to cut taxes and take Social Security
out of the deficit calculation could reduce pressure for real cuts
in the deficit and increase ``the difficulty of providing for the
needs of an aging population in a way that is equitable across
generations.''
   Greenspan's contention that a Social Security tax cut might
destabilize the economy conflicts with a new study by two former
Treasury Department officials.
   Economists Aldona Robbins and Gary Robbins argue that over 10
years, Moynihan's tax cut would increase the gross national product
by $346 billion, create 930,000 jobs and raise investment capital
by $162 billion.
   Unless the Social Security system is changed, the Robbinses
wrote:
   _``Today's average 30-year-old worker who will retire in 2025
could see his income taxes rise by 20 percent if the government is
to meet its Social Security promises.
   _``These higher taxes will be equivalent to a 7 percent
reduction in his or her Social Security benefits. What the
government gives with one hand it will be taking away with the
other.''
   The study was done for the Institute for Policy Innovation, a
Dallas research organization.

   High above mean city streets _ territory ruled
by surly cabbies, kamikaze bicycle messengers and pushy pedestrians
_ a group of civic leaders asked New Yorkers to embrace a
revolutionary concept.
   Good manners.
   ``There is no reason for us to accept the breakdown in this
city,'' Herbert Rickman said Tuesday as he announced the formation
of New York Pride, a foundation described as a citizen's army whose
objective is ``to make New York liveable once again.''
   Their theme song: ``Try A Little Tenderness.''
   The pervasive nastiness, Rickman said, threatens the city's No.
1 growth industry, tourism.
   ``When you look at exit surveys and people are asked, `Why don't
you want to come back?' one of the reasons is the rudeness and the
mean spiritedness,'' said Rickman, a lawyer who was former Mayor
Edward I. Koch's special assistant.
   The campaign's TV ads will feature rude cabbies and ruthless
bicyclists with the ``Try a Little Tenderness'' tune in the
background. A soothing voice admonishes, ``Come on New York, ease
up. Let's keep this the world's greatest city.''
   The foundation also plans to plant 30,000 trees this year and
produce a weekly radio talk show beginning next month. Other
projects include anti-litter and anti-graffiti campaigns in every
neighborhood, said Ralph Destino, chairman of Cartier and
co-chairman of New York Pride.
   The New York Pride campaign was launched in Rockefeller Center's
plush Rainbow Room, 65 stories above the streets. Conductor Zubin
Mehta, one of the celebrities on hand, said he wasn't sure at first
the effort was necessary.
   ``When you come from Bombay, New York is pristine,'' Mehta said.
   But Mehta allowed that New York would be nicer if cabbies smiled.
   ``They should say thank you when you tip them,'' said the leader
of the New York Philharmonic, who paused for a beat, and added:
``And they should know where they are going.''
   New York Pride will operate on about $250,000 and donated office
space. Its ads are being created gratis by a member agency. Radio
and TV time and print space will be sought on a public-service
basis _ dependent on the media's good will.

   When Bruce Gelb traveled to Moscow 30 years
ago as a businessman, the Russian phrase he heard most often was
``It's impossible.''
   Now, as director of the U.S. Information Agency and chief U.S.
negotiator in talks aimed at increasing the flow of information
between the superpowers, the Russian phrase he hears most often is
``Why not?''
   Gelb and Soviet deputy foreign minister Vladimir Petrovsky say
the latest round of U.S.-Soviet information talks, which opened
Monday, have cleared the way for signing two cultural agreements at
the superpower summit planned for June in the United States.
   One deal would allow the U.S. and Soviet governments to open
cultural centers in each other's capitals, Petrovsky said.
   The second, on President Bush's ``open lands'' proposal, would
reduce restrictions on U.S. and Soviet diplomats and journalists
working in each other's countries, Gelb said in an interview in his
office Tuesday.
   The mood of the current information talks is considerably
friendlier than the first round two years ago when Gelb's
predecessor, Charles Wick, stormed out of a meeting in Moscow after
Soviets accused U.S. scientists of inventing AIDS.
   U.S. officials have complained for years that Soviet media
carried ``disinformation,'' of which the AIDS allegation was the
most famous example. Gelb says such Soviet activities ``have
dropped down to an extremely low level.''
   Mutual recriminations have not disappeared from the talks, but
``virtually every one of the problems here has been described as a
mosquito that should be swatted,'' Gelb said.
   During this round, the Soviets complained that Voice of America,
a USIA radio station, broadcast inflammatory remarks in January
during unrest in Azerbaijan, a mostly Moslem republic on the Soviet
border with Iran.
   ``We are looking into it,'' Gelb said.
   Soviet officials want to remove barriers to information from the
West because ``they now realize that they can't keep information
out,'' Gelb said.
   Moreover, they want to learn how the West works. The information
talks this week included a working group on U.S. public opinion
surveys, and the Soviets have asked to send observers to a meeting
of the U.S. National Association of Broadcasters later this year,
Gelb said.
   The thirst for knowledge in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
is straining U.S. resources.
   USIA runs a $6 million program to foster democracy and
capitalism in Poland and Hungary, but that is far from enough.
   ``Right now, we have the resources to get halfway across the
ditch. We must scramble up the other side,'' Gelb said.
   Among the other developments at the information talks, the
Soviets have agreed to stop unlicensed medium-wave broadcasts from
Cuba to the United States and are ready to lift a ceiling of
150,000 on copies of the USIA Russian-language magazine ``America''
distributed in the Soviet Union.
   The Soviets also appear ready to allow a second VOA
correspondent to work in Moscow, said Gelb. Before the reforms, VOA
reporters were not allowed in the Soviet Union, and the radio
station was regularly condemned by official Soviet media.

   It's an administration where even the
agriculture secretary and the chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers are well advised to keep their passports handy.
   It's a presidency where domestic issues sprout international
wings and golfing weekends turn into summits.
   Foreign policy dominates the presidency of George Bush, while
domestic issues usually get second billing.
   That's partly because of the breathtaking march of world events
and partly because a still-growing economy has taken some of the
rough edges off many homegrown problems.
   But it's also because Bush, despite his protests of wanting to
be remembered as the ``education president'' and the
``environmental president,'' seems to be most content when he's
immersed in foreign policy.
   ``This has been a very unconventional presidency. Everything's
upside down,'' said Mitch Daniels, a White House aide in the Reagan
administration.
   ``The old rule was: You worked the domestic agenda until you ran
out of steam, then gassed up the plane and went abroad and made
headlines,'' said Daniels, who heads the Hudson Institute, a
conservative Indianapolis think tank. ``It is striking at how
different a pattern it is from the one we have become accustomed
to.''
   Bush, a restless man, is even turning what was planned as a
golfing vacation in Palm Springs, Calif., into a two-day working
session with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Bush, a former U.N. ambassador, China envoy and CIA chief, was
leaving today for the six-day Western trip that includes the Kaifu
meeting.
   Not only has Bush spent most of his time focusing on foreign
policy, but much of his domestic agenda has assumed international
dimensions.
   Thus, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher and Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, were dispatched to Poland recently to instruct
Poles on the ways of free-market economies.
   Boskin got another international assignment this week. He was
named by Bush to help oversee an upcoming international conference
on global warming.
   The war on crime, one of the most domestic of all issues, has
been largely overshadowed by the war on drugs, a battle with a
major international component.
   Bush and national drug policy director William Bennett recently
attended a daylong four-nation drug summit in violence-torn
Colombia to discuss ways to stem the flood of South American drugs
into the United States.
   A follow-up meeting is expected in the summer, and Bush has
talked about convening another drug summit next year that will
include European nations.
   Bush has been to 16 countries as president. Members of his
Cabinet are not far behind.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is on the road constantly.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady today was wrapping up a
four-nation swing through Europe.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was in Moscow in October and
earlier visited Spain and Uruguay.
   Louis Sullivan, secretary of health and human services, was in
Israel and Egypt meeting with health officials last month. Last May
he went to Geneva for a World Health Organization meeting. And he's
scheduled to go to London April 7-10 for a conference on drug abuse.
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos was sent by Bush to Bolivia
last August for the swearing-in of President Jaime Paz Zamora.
   And Bush himself plans to get some more visa stamps on his
passport, USA No. 1. Aides said Bush is considering a trip in
September to Argentina and Chile and likely will go to Australia,
Africa and Asia within the next year or two.
   Is Bush giving undue attention to foreign policy? No, says Rep.
Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   ``I think the dynamics of world events have given no one any
choice _ not the president, the Congress nor the media,'' Fascell
said in an interview.
   ``After all, when Nicaraguans went to bed on Sunday, it was
under a Marxist regime. They woke up in a democracy. And that's
remarkable,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union, with strong backing from the
United States, played an effective behind-the-scenes role in
encouraging Nicaragua's leftist government to hold an honest
election last Sunday, a senior official says.
   The official listed the Soviet role among a number of key
elements which persuaded the Sandinista authorities that free
elections were their best hope for obtaining legitimacy and
international economic support.
   The source spoke to reporters Tuesday after President Bush
conferred with congressional leaders about his plans for a
``significant and meaningful'' assistance program for Nicaragua in
the approaching post-Sandinista era. President-elect Violeta
Chamorro takes office April 25.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said aid for Nicaragua probably would run
into hundreds of millions of dollars over five years, and he
suggested the creation of an ``emerging democracy account'' to help
Nicaragua, Panama and the East European countries.
   The White House said it liked the idea if it meant the
administration would have more flexibility in dispensing U.S.
foreign aid. At present, Congress earmarks almost all aid for
specific countries, leaving the administration with few
discretionary funds for unexpected developments.
   Mrs. Chamorro's chief economic adviser, Francisco Mayorga,
arrives in Washington on Monday to discuss U.S. economic
cooperation with Nicaragua.
   For most of the Sandinista rule in Nicaragua, the Soviets were
widely portrayed in Washington as intent on establishing a
``communist beachhead'' there for promoting subversion and engaging
in other activities hostile to U.S. interests.
   But a far different picture of Soviet behavior emerged Tuesday
from the State Department briefer, who spoke to reporters on
condition of anonymity.
   Much of what he said had been reported previously. But taken
together, the Soviet activities in some ways suggested a strong
commitment to a peaceful settlement in Central America.
   As described by the official, the United States invariably
raised the Central America issue at high-level meetings with the
Soviets throughout 1989.
   There were ``some anomalies'' to the Soviet behavior, the
official said, noting that Moscow sent high-performance helicopters
to the Sandinistas last month and has continued to provide
large-scale assistance to Cuba.
   Cuba, in turn, has continued to support the leftist insurgency
in El Salvador, the official added.
   The official recalled that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
informed Bush last May that the Kremlin was no longer providing
direct military assistance to the Sandinistas.
   In August, he said, the Soviets were instrumental in persuading
the Sandinistas to make concessions to opposition groups that
enabled them to campaign freely for votes in Sunday's election.
   Last September, the official added, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze committed
themselves to support a halt in the use of Central America for
subversion, and they called for an end to outside aid to rebel
forces.
   At their most recent meeting two weeks ago, Baker and
Shevardnadze stressed the importance of impartial and effective
international observation of the electoral process and promised to
respect the outcome of the election.
   ``We believe that the Soviet Union played a constructive role in
encouraging the Sandinista government to hold these elections,''
the official said.
   Hours before the official spoke, a Soviet Foreign Ministry
official in Moscow told a news conference that the Kremlin
recognizes the results of the Nicaraguan election and is prepared
to negotiate with the new leadership about future relations.
   Ion Burlaia, the deputy chief for Latin America in the Foreign
Ministry, said the Soviets would continue to give non-military aid
to Nicaragua if the new government wants it, and also was prepared
to negotiate future trade and military cooperation.

   In the cafes, meeting rooms and streets of Little
Havana, Cuban exiles say the election-booth ouster of Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega shows Fidel Castro's fall is finally within
reach.
   Euphoria took hold here as democratic changes began sweeping
Eastern Europe. Now that a domino effect has put Panama's Manuel
Noriega in jail and appears to have knocked Ortega from power, many
exiles say Castro's downfall is inevitable.
   ``In the streets, the Cubans are saying `Yesterday was Manuel.
Today is Daniel. And tomorrow is Fidel.' That is the popular
joke,'' said Tomas Garcia Fuste, a commentator at the
Spanish-language radio station WQBA. ``Never before have we been so
close.
   ``I have convinced myself that we'll have a chance to go to Cuba
within the year.''
   The stunning upset by the opposition in Nicaragua shows it is
impossible to predict the amount of support a dictator enjoys from
his people, said Jorge Mas Canosa, director of the right-wing Cuban
American National Foundation.
   ``Cuban people love democracy and freedom as much as their
neighbor,'' Mas Canosa said Tuesday. ``Most Cubans must be asking
why not in Cuba? Why not on the island?''
   In Miami, business owners are preparing to cash in the untapped
consumer demand of 10 million people if the United States renews
trade with a democratic Cuba.
   Some of the city's estimated 700,000 Cuban exiles are delaying
vacations and putting off buying houses, hoping their decades-old
refrain, ``Next year in Havana,'' might come true.
   ``It's not only our feeling. Castro is in his countdown,'' said
Modesto Castaner, a veteran of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs invasion
in 1961. ``The Cuban people are standing by for something to
happen.''
   The excitement among exiles is growing stronger despite evidence
that Castro, 62, remains as strong as ever.
   Cuba's communist leadership, facing widespread food shortages
and possible cuts in the $5 billion in annual aid the country gets
from the Soviet Union, rejected multiparty rule at a meeting Feb.
16 while calling for some reforms to ``perfect'' the revolution
Castro led 31 years ago.
   About 5,000 people ready to go to work in a new Cuba have signed
on with the group called Cuban Municipalities in Exile in a project
begun several weeks ago. The names on the list include builders,
doctors, plumbers, teachers and farmers, said Roberto Rodriguez
Aragon, the group's president.
   Mas Canosa's group has arranged for conservative economists
Milton Friedman and Arthur Laffer to help prepare a plan to
transform Cuba to a free-market economy. Gov. Bob Martinez has
appointed a commission to study the impact on Florida of an end to
Castro's rule.
   Even Miami police are preparing _ for a huge party.
   ``If tomorrow Castro dies, you will see the greatest day in
Miami since its foundation. Everything will come to a stop. It will
be a tremendous celebration,'' said Castaner.
   ``Cuba is close to hitting rock bottom,'' said Maria Christina
Herrera, head of the Institute for Cuban Studies, which has
advocated dialogue with Castro's government. ``It can move no
further backward. It can move forward or else.''
   Some right-wing Cuban exiles say they'll do whatever they can to
make the change come soon. After training for years in isolated
military camps in the Everglades, Castaner says his group is just
waiting for the right signal.
   But ``we don't want to create a situation where people think
we're going to invade tomorrow,'' Castaner said from the
headquarters of Brigade 2506 in Little Havana. ``We're collecting
names and phone numbers should anything happen immediately.''
   It's unclear how many exiles would return to the island to stay.
   For a generation of Cuban-Americans, living in Cuba has been
just a dream kept alive by older relatives and politicians. Exiles
have fostered a thriving culture in Miami, where the Cuban
lifestyle is prevalent, speaking English isn't necessary and many
government services are available for the asking.
   ``The emotion will bring them over there, but the reality will
bring them back,'' said Horatio Villazon, 71, as he played cards in
Maximo Gomez Park, a street corner in Little Havana named for a
hero of the Cuban independence movement. ``They are dreaming and
playing politics.''

<HEAD>VA Considers Changing Benefits, Including Uniform Death Benefit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs says it is
considering several changes in benefits, including a stricter
definition of service-connected disability and a uniform death
benefit.
   Other possible changes include an extension of psychiatric
disability payments for disturbed veterans while they try to get
jobs and a shorter waiting period before people can claim total
service-connected disability.
   VA said Tuesday the possible changes are part of an effort to
put more emphasis on less expensive outpatient care and expand
eligibility for nursing home care.
   Undersecretary Anthony Principi, who heads the group studying
the changes, said the VA is trying to bring the system up to date
with the ``trend in modern medicine to more ambulatory care.''
   He said VA wants more emphasis on prevention and more use of
alternatives to hospitals, such as hospice care, for the terminally
ill.
   Any proposal to change service-connected disabilities is bound
to be controversial. Nearly 2.2 million veterans receive such
payments, ranging from $67 to $1,500 and even higher for some of
the totally disabled. The total annual cost is close to $9 billion.
   Currently, any disability that arises during military service is
considered to be service-connected, entitling the veteran to
compensation payments based on the degree of disability.
   The possible tightening would rule out disability payments _ but
not VA medical care _ for ``disabilities that would have arisen
regardless of the individual's vocation.''
   Diabetes, for example, would be excluded. So, too, would AIDS if
contracted from injecting drugs.
   The VA released details of the proposal after a veterans' group
released details during a congressional hearing on Tuesday.
   VA said some of the proposals released by the Disabled American
Veterans had been abandoned, such as the proposed elimination of
cost-of-living allowances for certain disabled veterans and for
different disability payments for wartime and peacetime veterans.
   Any proposed changes would have to be approved by the Office of
Management and Budget before being sent to Congress.
   VA said the proposals being considered would not be retroactive.
The only exception would be to increase the death benefit
retroactively for survivors of lower-ranked veterans.
   Benefits range from $539 a month for survivors of privates and
corporals to $1,381 for survivors of generals and admirals. The
possible change would create a uniform payment of $700 to $750 a
month.
   Those benefits cost about $2.3 billion a year, with the largest
share going to the lower ranks.
   Another possible change would be to shorten a veteran's wait
from 20 years to 10 years before being able to receive the
permanent disability classification.
   Principi said that paying psychiatric disability payments for a
year while a person tried to hold down a job would pay for itself
by encouraging people to get better.

   On the streets of Sandinista defeat,
the red-and-black banners still flutter defiantly from almost every
lamppost.
   The blue-and-white of the victorious United National Opposition
is visible only in flashes _ the blue-and-white cap on the driver
as a pickup truck goes by; a few posters on a wall that doesn't
face the street.
   Many people believe Nicaragua became a democracy at 6 a.m.
Monday, when President Daniel Ortega, tired, eloquent, defiant,
said his Sandinista party would obey the will of the voters.
   But the victors are just beginning to emerge from their shell
shock, and the losers are holding their breath.
   It is two months to April 25, when Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
the symbol of resistance to 10{ years of Sandinismo, is sworn in as
president.
   ``I still can't believe that UNO won,'' Maritza Arguello, wife
of a coffee grower, said Tuesday. ``I'm just sitting quietly until
it actually happens.''
   ``They didn't dare celebrate in the streets. They're cockroaches
that are staying hidden,'' said Mercado Gonzalez de Lopez, a member
of a Sandinista women's group.
   She and five friends had come from a poor neighborhood to stand
in front of the government radio station and demonstrate their
support for their beloved Daniel.
   This Managua of defeat and victory is also a city of pain.
Everyone has a story, a story that makes them fearful or cautiously
optimistic about the future.
   The pain of defeat can leap out unexpectedly, even for the
sufferer, as it did in a party official who was asked to move his
car so that another could be moved in a jammed parking lot.
   ``You're a foreigner. You're a foreigner. Have a little
respect,'' the man suddenly yelled furiously.
   Karina Quiroz de Marin is one of the happy fearful.
   ``I'm happy, but the people aren't celebrating because they fear
the turbinas,'' she said.
   The turbinas or turbas, the disturbers, are the violent crowds
of young Sandinistas that were used for so long to awe or cow the
opposition.
   There was a time when Ortega called them divine, but now he is
working for reconciliation, hugging his opponent, telling his
supporters they must defend the achievements of the revolution but
respect the vote.
   Mrs. Marin's story begins with a traffic accident. Her
husband-to-be was hit by a car running a red light. The car
belonged to a high government official's escort.
   Her fiance was beaten and suffered broken facial bones, she said.
   Mrs. Marin saved the bills, including the bills for repairs to
the official car, in case there was a day she could present them.
   ``Not for payment,'' she said. ``Just so people will know.''
   What she is now is a black market money-changer; as her pink
Polo shirt shows, the profession has been good to her despite the
risk of jail.
   Amanda Pinero, also at the Voice of Nicaragua, said she feared a
return of dictator Anastasio Somoza's National Guard. That fear may
owe something to Sandinista campaign strategy of linking the guard
to U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas and the opposition coalition.
   The long Contra war caused enough pain on both sides to fill an
ocean.
   It ended in military victory for the Sandinistas at a cost of
60,000 lives in a nation of 3 million. But now, suddenly, it seems
to many that the Contras somehow won.
   ``The guard threw me out of my house,'' said Pinero, a
66-year-old widow. ``It's hard for me to see the guard return, they
(the Contras) killed my only son.'' She stops, it's the pain. ``He
was the only thing I had.''
   For many, the radio stations have been an outlet. While a
station that supports UNO broadcasts rousing songs about Violeta
and seldom-founded rumors that a Sandinista crowd is gathering, the
Sandinista airwaves resound with fury and sorrow.
   Callers urge Daniel to ignore the vote because it was stolen or
bought; they accuse international observers and journalists of
ignoring their complaints; they say they will do what the party
says and stand by Daniel forever.
   Former President Jimmy Carter said UNO was concerned about the
violent sentiments expressed.
   ``Although I regret it, maybe that's a good way to let them vent
their feelings and let off steam,'' he told a small group of
reporters Tuesday.
   Thousands of Sandinistas vented their steam at an impromptu
rally Tuesday outside the Olof Palme Convention Center, when the
Sandinista party called its leadership from city, town and country
to explain how the party would conduct itself as an opposition _ a
powerful opposition, but an opposition nonetheless.
   Like many government workers at the rally, Angel Madrona said he
was thinking about a new job.
   ``We'll see what the directorate says,'' he said. ``If they want
me to work for the UNO government, I will. But I don't want to.''
   Madrona, a public relations worker at the Ministry of Foreign
Cooperation, which coordinates foreign aid to Nicaragua, said he
would probably do the previously unthinkable and move to the
private sector.
   The crowd gathered through the afternoon as word spread that the
leadership was meeting. The old chants and cheers echoed until late
afternoon, when Ortega finally spoke.
   Treading carefully between militancy and conciliation, he said
the revolution would not end.
   ``A change of government does not mean the end of the
revolution,'' he told the crowd, which cheered and started to march
through town.
   Ortega suggested they go to Carlos Fonseca Plaza, an
out-of-the-way location on the lakeshore where Ortega spoke in
pre-election triumph only Wednesday to 300,000 people.
   But minutes later one of Managua's heavy rainstorms broke, and
though a small cohort marched on, most of the crowd leaked away in
search of shelter from the storm.

<HEAD>Inmate Advocates Say They'll Continue to Fight Drug Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoner-rights advocates disappointed by a
Supreme Court decision say they'll continue to fight on the state
level to assure inmates are not given anti-psychotic drugs
indiscriminately.
   ``The trend is for state courts to give more protection'' to
inmates than the Supreme Court, said Brian Reed Phillips, a lawyer
for a Washington state prisoner forced to take the drugs.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote Tuesday, said prison officials don't
need a judge's permission before forcing inmates to take the drugs.
   Robert D. Fleischner, representing a prisoner-rights coalition
in Massachusetts, said some states guarantee a judicial hearing
before prisoners can be forced to take the medication.
   ``Massachusetts requires judicial intervention and the system
has worked to protect people's rights,'' he said. ``Requiring the
appropriate care has not been overly burdensome.''
   Washington State Correction Secretary Chase Riveland said
Tuesday's ruling won't lead to a medication binge for disruptive
prisoners.
   ``I'm not suggesting that we should be willy-nilly running
around medicating people,'' he said. ``I think that ... if
medically appropriate it's very helpful.''
   Riveland said the ruling may affect 10 to 15 Washington
prisoners.
   The Supreme Court ruled that prisoners' rights are safeguarded
as long as staff psychiatrists say the drugs will help, and not
merely pacify, the inmates.
   ``An inmate's interests are adequately protected and perhaps
better served by allowing the decision to medicate to be made by
medical professionals rather than a judge,'' Justice Anthony M.
Kennedy wrote for the court.
   But the dissenters, led by Justice John Paul Stevens, said the
ruling means prison officials seeking to maintain order may force
inmates to take dangerous, even life-threatening, drugs with little
regard for the prisoners' well-being.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled 5-4 in a Florida case that patients involuntarily
committed to state mental hospitals may sue officials in federal
court for monetary damages over failure to get legally required
hearings.
   _Ruled unanimously that the Boeing Co. did not violate a federal
conflict-of-interest law when it paid $485,000 in severance to five
employees who left to take government jobs.
   The prisoners' rights decision overturned a 1988 Washington
state Supreme Court ruling that convicted robber Walter Harper,
diagnosed as schizophrenic, must be given a court hearing before he
is given anti-psychotic drugs.
   The case pitted the American Psychiatric Association, which
supported the prison officials, against the American Psychological
Association.
   Clifford Stromberg, a lawyer for the psychologists group, said
the court ``unfortunately seems to have underestimated the danger
of these drugs, particularly when no objective decision-maker
decides when they're going to be used.''
   Harper, paroled on condition he take the drugs, was returned to
prison after he attacked two nurses at a Seattle hospital. Back in
prison, he refused in 1982 to take the medication, saying it was
poisoning his brain and causing other side effects.
   He sued when prison officials forced him to take the drugs. The
officials said the drugs were for his own good and needed to
control his violent behavior.
   The state Supreme Court, calling the drugs as intrusive as
electro-shock therapy, ruled that an inmate who has not been found
mentally incompetent has a right to determine what should be done
to his body.
   While the drugs are beneficial to seriously ill patients, they
also can have serious side effects ranging from involuntary spasms
to permanent brain damage.
   Prisoner-rights advocates say physical restraints or isolation
are preferable methods to control unruly inmates. But public health
and law enforcement officials say it makes little sense to give an
irrational or mentally disturbed person the right to veto sensible
medical practices.
   Courts in several states have ruled that mental patients who are
legally competent have a right to refuse anti-psychotic drugs.
   But, according to some studies, judges in those states almost
always decide that anti-psychotic drugs may be administered against
the individual's will after holding hearings in individual cases.

<HEAD>Flexibility Is Administration Watchword</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report by the Agriculture Department says
the 1990 wheat program included a great deal of flexibility, the
latest farm policy watchword in the Bush administration.
   The Economic Research Service report also noted that winter
wheat farmers accept the idea too well.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced in September
that farmers participating in the 1990 wheat program could plant up
to 105 percent of their wheat base. The goal was to produce more
wheat this year.
   But for every acre planted in excess of 95 percent of the base,
the acreage used to compute ``deficiency'' payments would be
reduced by one acre.
   Despite the leeway, farmers boosted winter wheat plantings last
fall by only 3 percent from a year earlier. In Kansas, the major
producer, there was no increase.
   ``Farmers may have been reluctant to lose deficiency payments or
acreage in fallow rotation, or their plantable area may have been
constrained by the amount of wheat base they had idled under the
Conservation Reserve Program,'' the report said. ``Much of the CRP
land in Kansas is wheat base.''
   The report, included in the March issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said dry soil conditions may have held down plantings in
some areas. Also, farmers may have learned about the 1990 program
changes too late to alter their plans.
   ``In any case, the relatively small wheat response to the 105
percent offer should not be taken as an indication that farmers
would not respond to more if the administration's new proposal were
adopted,'' the report said. ``The 105 percent provision is just a
small part of the new flexibility.''
   For example, it said, corn farmers in Indiana this year could
not plant wheat on corn base and still collect deficiency payments.
They could under the new flexibility proposal.
   A farmer with 100 acres of corn base, 100 acres of wheat base
and 100 acres of a new oilseed base would set aside 20 acres of
wheat and corn land if there was a 10 percent ``acreage reduction
program'' requirement, or ARP.
   ``One the remaining 280 acres, the farmer could grow any program
or oilseed crop and still collect deficiency payments as if the
permitted base acres had been planted to wheat and corn,'' the
report said. ``And base history, which is used to calculate future
eligibility for benefits, would be unaffected.''
   Further, any conserving-use crop such as clover or alfalfa could
be grown on program cropland without loss of deficiency payments _
so long as it was not harvested. Also, farmers could grow certain
non-program alternative crops on base acres but would give up
deficiency payments for those acres.
   ``Producers would be able to grow and harvest the program crop,
conserving crops and industrial crops on the ARP acreage as well,
but would forgo deficiency payments on an acre-for-acre basis,''
the report said.
   The article, written by economists Greg Gajewski and Ed Allen,
said some farmers ``could face more challenges'' if the
administration's proposals are accepted by Congress.
   ``For example, some soybean farmers who lacked wheat, feed
grain, rice or cotton base might experience stiffer competition as
more producers switched to soybeans in years when soybean prospects
appeared especially bright,'' the report said. ``The competition
would result because there is no target price and deficiency
mechanism for soybeans, and none is being proposed.''
   However, it added, some traditional soybean growers might switch
to other crops in relatively tight supply ``and expect a reasonable
return from them.''

   A government report says widespread snow and
rain over large areas of the Great Plains have brightened the
outlook for wheat farmers.
   ``Moisture improved winter wheat growth in the central and
southern Great Plains'' during the week of Feb. 19-25, the Joint
Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday. ``The northern Great
Plains remained dry.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. Weekly reports cover weather and crop conditions but do
not include production forecasts.
   Looking at other crops, the report said rain again slowed field
work in the Delta and Southeast. Corn planting began in southwest
Georgia and continued in Florida and Texas.
   Rain fell in all of Florida's citrus areas, and new growth was
reported ``abundant and trees were blooming in all areas.''
   ``Cold temperatures may have damaged peaches in northern Georgia
and portions of Tennessee,'' the report said. ``Peaches were
blooming in Texas (and) cold temperatures may have damaged peaches
in the Cross Timbers area.''
   In California, early varieties of apricots, plums, nectarines
and peaches were blooming, but frost damage was reported to early
peaches and table grapes in Riverside County.

   The value of U.S. agricultural exports is
forecast at $38.5 billion this year, up $500 million from prospects
last fall, according to an analysis by the Agriculture Department.
   But the new forecast for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 still
represents a 3 percent decline from an eight-year high of $39.7
billion in 1989. The record was $43.8 billion in 1981.
   ``The upward revision (from November) largely reflected a 3
million ton increase in expected U.S. coarse grain exports,'' the
report said Tuesday. ``Prospects for foreign coarse grain imports
have increased, and U.S. corn is expected to capture a larger
share.''
   Overall, fiscal 1990 exports are forecast at 148.5 million
metric tons, up 3 million tons from November and nearly 2 million
tons more then in 1989.
   The decline in value was blamed on ``lower prices for grains and
oilseeds,'' which more than offset the larger export volume.
   Estimates of agricultural imports were raised $500 million to
$21.5 billion, matching last year's record.
   ``December's severe freeze in Florida and Texas has increased
prospects for fruit, juice and vegetable imports,'' the report said.

   A judge who wants to hold a jail house
party is sure the well-heeled will pay $100 each for the chance to
slumber in the slammer.
   ``For one night, we could be operating the largest hotel in the
city,'' said Tarrant County Judge Roy English, who proposed a
sleep-over party in the 1,400-bed jail at a session Monday of the
county Commissioners Court.
   The party would show off the new jail, built to ease
overcrowding, and raise money for a worthy cause _ either a
memorial to slain Tarrant County police officers, or a charity such
one that helps the homeless, English said.
   A jail party in Flint, Mich., in which lavishly dressed guests
toasted with champagne and danced in the cells, was lampooned in
last year's film ``Roger and Me.''
   English said he hasn't seen the movie but has heard of jail
parties elsewhere.
   Sheriff Don Carpenter said he has seen too many jail interiors
to pay to get into one, but he likes the idea of showing off the
building.
   ``Everyone wants to know what a jail looks like,'' he said.

   Weird temperature shifts are cracking open the
streets of this former Pony Express station, and the driving is
reminiscent of rough rider days.
   ``It's the pits. You just literally bounce down the street,''
said Shirel Ames, deli manager at a 7-Eleven.
   ``We haven't had any killer potholes where we've had to
roadblock anything, but it is worse than usual because of the
moisture out there and the constant freezing and thawing,'' John
Loete, Reno's maintenance engineer, said Tuesday. ``The 40-degree
temperature swings we get each day make the situation worse.''
   The worst street blemishes were revealed with the melting of 22
inches of snow that fell in a Feb. 16-17 storm, the heaviest
snowfall since 1916.
   The asphalt has been loosened and cracked from freezing and
thawing that cause expansion and contraction, said Bob Mays, county
road superintendent.
   Loete said his crews were regularly coming across potholes a
foot wide and a few inches deep.
   ``I'm sure we'll see some more because right now there's still a
lot of ice out there covering problems up,'' Loete said.

   Researchers will show the Marx Brothers,
The Three Stooges, W.C. Fields and ``I Love Lucy'' to ailing
nursing home residents to test the theory that tickling the funny
bone can be therapeutic.
   Researchers will show about 150 nursing home residents comic
films and TV programs to see if humor can reduce requests for
non-prescription pain medicine, Fran McGuire, a Clemson University
researcher, said this week.
   ``If this kind of thing is true, it would be a tremendous tool
for activity directors'' in nursing homes and other group settings,
said McGuire.
   A smaller study by Clemson two years ago indicated what appeared
to be dramatic decreases in requests for drugs, he said. That could
have been the result of chemical changes in the body or the result
of reduced stress.
   That study found that later comedies didn't do the trick, said
Rosangela Boyd, who showed the films at a nursing home as part of
the earlier study.
   ``They did not find modern comedies, such as `Three Men and a
Baby,' to be funny nor did they like any of the films with
offensive language,'' she said.

<HEAD>White House Denies Contacts With Iran on Hostages</HEAD>

   The White House is doing everything possible
to win freedom for the eight American hostages in Lebanon, but a
spokesman says there's no evidence to suggest their release will
come soon.
   ``We are ... pursuing every lead, pursuing every contact,
talking to everybody we can,'' presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   However, Fitzwater denied a report that the United States and
Iran had held secret talks on the hostages in Geneva.
   ``There are no direct talks between Iran and the United States
authorized by the president,'' he said in response to a report in
the London-based Lebanese newspaper, Al Hayat. ``We have no
information on any special missions to Geneva of the kind that's
reported here.
   ``There are a lot of people around the world talking about
release of the hostages in Lebanon,'' involving Americans and
people from other countries ``at all levels,'' he said.
   ``I will never rule out meetings anywhere, anyplace, any time by
anybody on the hostage question, because there are meetings
happening. But high level U.S. officials? Direct secret talks? No.
   ``Do I expect a breakthrough or anything new happening? No,''
Fitzwater said.
   Al-Hayat reported that Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, a key
Lebanese Shiite Moslem cleric, said contacts occurred between Iran
and the United States through third parties.
   Fadlallah is the spiritual leader of the Iran-aligned Hezbollah
group. Some Western hostages are believed held by factions linked
to Hezbollah.
   Fitzwater said recent comments by Iranian President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani and Fadlallah, as well as Peggy Say's meeting
with Palestinian Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat
``have created a lot of new speculation and hope about the
hostages.''
   But, he said, ``we know of no new evidence to support that
hope.''
   Mrs. Say is the sister of Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press and the longest held hostage.
He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Arafat told Mrs. Say he was trying to win release of the
Americans and 10 other foreign hostages, but that he had no direct
influence on the kidnappers.
   Last month, a Kuwaiti newspaper said ``an American personality''
had met in Geneva with a representative of Rafsanjani to discuss
the hostages. None of the parties was identified.
   The other American hostages are Thomas Sutherland, Frank Herbert
Reed, Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy, Jesse Turner,
Alann Steen and Robert Polhill.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Judges Bow Out of Bomb-Related Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judges of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals removed themselves Tuesday from the case of a man being
investigated in a series of mail bombings that killed one of their
colleagues.
   Walter Leroy Moody Jr. filed a motion last week contending the
judges could not be impartial on matters related to his case
because of the mail bomb that killed 11th Circuit Judge Robert S.
Vance at his Mountain Brook, Ala., home.
   ``The active and senior judges of this court, acting on their
own initiative, hereby recuse themselves from participating in this
case and in any other case relating to the investigation of the
murder of the honorable Robert S. Vance, in which Walter Leroy
Moody Jr. is a party,'' said Tuesday's order, signed by Chief Judge
Gerald Tjoflat.
   The order did not address Moody's request to disqualify all
federal district judges in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, some of
whom serve temporarily on the appeals bench.
   Moody, of Rex, Ga., is one of three men whose property has been
searched during the federal investigation of the spate of bombings
late last year. Vance and Robert Robinson, a Savannah attorney and
alderman, were killed by bombs, and bombs were intercepted at the
11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta and in Jacksonville, Fla.
   No one has been charged in the case.
   The 11th Circuit has before it an appeal of U.S. District Judge
Richard C. Freeman's order last week sealing all proceedings in the
investigation of Moody until further court order or an indictment.
The order, requested by Moody, was appealed by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution and WSB-TV.
   Moody also has asked the courts to order the return of items
confiscated by investigators from his home, storage area and
vehicles, and has filed court papers accusing the Atlanta
newspapers of violating Freeman's order by publishing a story about
his motion to disqualify the judges.

<HEAD>Safety Board: Airliner Brakes Less Safe With Wear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airliner brakes can't handle high-energy
aborted takeoffs as they wear thin, even though they meet federal
certification standards, the National Transportation Safety Board
says.
   Blaming ``inadequate certification'' by the Federal Aviation
Administration for the May 21 aborted takeoff of an American
Airlines DC-10 at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, the safety board
called Tuesday for airlines to re-evaluate the capacity of their
brakes when they begin to wear out.
   Board member Jim Burnett said the problem could be costly for
the aviation industry because, without new brake designs, it might
involve reducing the capacity of airliners, the distance they could
fly or the length of runways.
   The American jetliner skidded more than 1,000 feet off the end
of the runway, injuring eight of its 254 occupants. The plane was
too severely damaged to repair.
   It was the first time the board had cited FAA certification of
an airliner model as the probable cause in a crash, Burnett said.
   ``We have already lost an airliner and we face the real
possibility of losing a planeful of people,'' he said after the
four-member panel approved a series of recommendations to the FAA
and airlines for testing the capacity of brakes when they are worn.
   The board raised doubts about FAA certification and test
procedures for all airliner brakes, which it said may fail when
planes abort takeoffs at high speed.
   The Dallas plane, scheduled to fly to Frankfurt, West Germany,
reached 178 miles per hour before the pilot reversed engine thrust
and applied the brakes. The brakes failed before the plane reached
the end of the runway.
   The NTSB also blamed the brake manufacturer, Loral, in the
aborted takeoff.
   Board members said brakes near their wear limit don't have the
same margin of safety as new ones, and the FAA didn't consider that
when it certified the brakes on the DC-10 two decades ago.
   Airlines have about 3,000 rejected takeoffs each year, but most
are executed at a low enough speed that braking power, combined
with reverse engine thrust, is adequate to stop the plane without
damage.
   But an average of about four high-powered rejections result in
accidents each year, board members said.
   Investigators testified that only the newest brakes are adequate
to safely stop an airliner that has to abort a takeoff near
``V-1,'' the velocity at which the plane ordinarily must continue
its take off. The American plane was near that speed when a warning
light and audible signal indicated a wing-slat problem.
   The signal proved to be false, but the board did not fault the
pilot for aborting the takeoff.
   In a separate action, the board recommended that the DC-10's
warning system on wing slat deployment be redesigned so it won't go
off so late in the takeoff. Investigators said planes are easily
able to fly even when slats are in the worst position, while a
high-powered aborted takeoff can be dangerous.

<HEAD>Fancy Legal Footwork Accompanies Government Move To Quash Enrile</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The arrest of opposition Sen. Juan
Ponce Enrile on charges of supporting the bloody December coup
attempt was aimed at projecting an image of toughness in a
government long criticized as weak.
   But fancy legal footwork raises doubt about government motives.
   Enrile, a former defense minister and one of President Corazon
Aquino's most outspoken critics, was arrested Tuesday after he and
six others were indicted for allegedly supporting the Dec. 1-9
failed coup, in which at least 113 people were killed and more than
600 wounded.
   The 66-year-old senator was the most prominent figure arrested
in any of the six armed attempts to oust Mrs. Aquino since she took
power in the February 1986 ``people power'' uprising against
Ferdinand Marcos.
   After previous coup attempts, the government was criticized for
weakness because of lenient treatment of mutineers. Although dozens
of officers have been convicted in coup attempts, most enlisted
participants are simply reassigned to different units.
   In a radio interview today, presidential Press Secretary Tomas
Gomez acknowledged that the government felt under pressure to take
decisive action in order to restore confidence among foreign
investors.
   ``Our friends abroad are beginning to shy away,'' Gomez said.
``They are scared because they (mutineers) have created a
perception of instability, that this government has very weak
knees.''
   In moving against Enrile, the government stretched existing
statutes to charge him with as serious an offense as possible.
Enrile was charged with ``rebellion with murder.'' Under the
charge, which carries a life sentence, no bail is allowed.
   According to documents released so far, the government's case is
based on statements by witnesses who claimed they saw Enrile with
mutineers the first two days of the coup attempt. Prosecutors claim
that proves Enrile supported the mutiny.
   Legal sources not involved in the case say Enrile should have
been charged only with ``rebellion,'' a lesser offense that carries
six to 12 years imprisonment and allows bail.
   The sources cite a 1956 Supreme Court decision that ruled
offenses such as murder committed in connection with an uprising
should be lumped together as rebellion.
   Gomez said the government would ask the court to reconsider that
decision and approve charges of rebellion with murder in the Enrile
case.
   He said the Department of Justice has begun ``a legal crusade
... to request the Supreme Court that it is now time to review the
existing jurisprudence,'' he said. ``Remember that there are forces
led by Mr. Enrile who would like to destroy the democracy of ours.''
   During martial law, Marcos overturned the 1956 court decision
and authorized lumping rebellion and murder. But Mrs. Aquino
canceled Marcos' decree in June 1987 as ``repressive.''
   The government's handling of the filing of charges showed the
political sensitivity of the case. Justice officials leaked word of
the charges on Monday, then announced they would be filed in a
regional court in suburban Makati.
   Enrile's lawyers and reporters rushed there early Tuesday, but
government prosecutors said they were waiting ``for some
documents'' before filing the complaint.
   But the only charge filed against Enrile in Makati was harboring
a fugitive, a relatively minor offense. The more serious rebellion
with murder charge was filed quietly in another court in what
government sources said was a calculated ruse to throw Enrile's
lawyers off guard.
   The moves have created the impression among some Filipinos that
the government is interested primarily in nailing Enrile. Gomez
denied there was any vendetta but added: ``How can one be
vindictive to a person who is also perceived to be a criminal.''
   Enrile is among the most controversial figures here because of
his long involvement with the most odious aspects of the Marcos
government. As Marcos' defense minister, Enrile ordered the arrest
of thousands, including Mrs. Aquino's late husband, Benigno Jr.,
during the eight years of martial law.
   Later, Enrile broke with Marcos and led the February 1986
military mutiny that triggered the ``people power'' uprising. Mrs.
Aquino retained him as defense minister but fired him nine months
later after a failed coup by his followers.
   Since then, neither Mrs. Aquino nor Enrile have made any secret
of their mutual loathing. Enrile has accused Mrs. Aquino of
corruption and incompetence. Last week, he publicly ``apologized''
for helping install her in power.
   On Sunday, during a speech marking her fourth year in office,
Mrs. Aquino repeatedly accused Enrile of seeking to restore
dictatorship, adding: ``Mr. Enrile, have you no shame?''
   ``Blame it on the timing, but people are bound to doubt if the
rebellion charges with murder filed yesterday against (Enrile)
indeed show the `effective operation of our criminal justice
system' or is simply political vengeance at its worst,'' the
independent daily Malaya said.

<HEAD>Angolans Meeting With U.S. Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two high-ranking Angolans are meeting with
U.S. officials this week amid conflicting reports about the
military situation in the African country.
   Minister of Justice Fernando Van Dunem and Gen. Roberto
Monteiro-Ngongo, deputy chief of staff of the Angolan military said
they had tried to explain why their government launched a military
offensive earlier this year.
   Peace prospects have deteriorated recently because of the
intense fighting between the Soviet-backed government of President
Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the U.S.-backed UNITA rebels of Jonas
Savimbi.
   ``Everybody is tired of war,'' Van Dunem said in an interview
Tuesday. ``We have never had a single day of peace.''
   The State Department and Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and
Bob Dole, R-Kan., have criticized the dos Santos government for its
military activities.
   ``Little attention has been paid in recent months to what may
become a large-scale slaughter,'' DeConcini said earlier this
month, condemning the dos Santos government's military offensive in
southern Africa.
   Jardo Muekalia, Savimbi's representative in Washington, accused
the Angolan government of derailing the peace process with its
military activity. Under a 1989 agreement, Zairian President Seko
Sese Mobutu was supposed to mediate between the two sides to form a
national reconciliation.
   The Angolan officials met with Assistant Secretary of State
Herman Cohen and members of Congress to clarify the dos Santos
government's position.
   Any military action is simply retaliation for Savimbi, they
said. ``The government had to react ... show our ability to keep
law and order,'' van Dunem said.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Africa
subcommittee, said he met with the Angolans but did not have a
clear picture of what was happening in Angola.
   ``My sense is that there has been more military activity,'' he
said. ``Our interest is to get people back to the negotiating
table.''
   Recent fighting has centered around Mavinga, 700 miles southeast
of the capital of Luanda.
   An airstrip at Mavinga and a nearby rebel base block the
government forces way to rebel headquarters at Jamba, more than 120
miles farther south.
   Van Dunem and Monteiro-Ngongo said the government controlled
Mavinga where mopping up operations were under way. They also said
the government had bombed Jamba on Saturday.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said fighting continues around Mavinga, but it's ``not clear if
either controls the entire Mavinga.'' The official could not
confirm that Jamba had been bombed.
   Muekalia denied that Jamba had been bombed, but said the
government had conducted ``carpet bombings'' in the country against
UNITA.

<HEAD>Grand Jury in Stuart Shooting Reportedly Hears 10-Year-Old</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury has a new twist in the Stuart
shooting case: A 10-year-old boy testified he heard a shot and saw
a tall, black man fleeing from the Stuarts' car the night of the
shooting, news reports said.
   The Boston Herald and WBZ-TV quoted unidentified sources as
saying the boy, along with a teacher and a teacher's aide from a
special-education primary school the boy attended, testified before
the Suffolk County grand jury Monday.
   The unidentified boy lives on the street in the Mission Hill
district where Charles and Carol Stuart were found wounded in their
car Oct. 23.
   Stuart called police on his car phone and directed them to where
he and his wife had been shot. Stuart said he and his pregnant wife
were shot by a black man who got in their car and robbed them after
they left a hospital birthing class.
   Mrs. Stuart died hours after she was shot. Her child, delivered
prematurely, died 17 days later.
   A black man, William Bennett, reportedly was considered the
leading suspect in the shootings until Stuart was implicated by his
brother Matthew on Jan. 3. The next day, Charles Stuart apparently
jumped to his death from a bridge.
   District Attorney Newman Flanagan then said Bennett, who had
been arrested on an unrelated charge, no longer was considered a
suspect.
   The police manhunt for a black man and the subsequent revelation
that Stuart may have been the real culprit prompted outrage in
Mission Hill and charges of racism from civil rights leaders.
   The 10-year-old apparently told his teachers what he had heard
and seen shortly after the shootings, but prosecutors were not told
until recently, the Herald said.

   The dollar retreated Wednesday, as the key
indicator on the Tokyo Stock Market soared.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 148.52 yen, down 0.51 yen
from Tuesday's close of 149.03 yen. It opened at 148.64 yen and
ranged from 148.33-148.89 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's leading
indicator, gained 694.04 points, or 2.0 percent, to close the day
at 34,591.99. Volume was relatively heavy as an estimated 700
million shares changed hands.
   The Nikkei rose 576.08 points on Tuesday, one day after Monday's
plunge of 1,569.10 points, or 4.5 percent.
   The dollar closed morning trading at 148.55 yen, down from
148.64 at the opening and off from Tuesday's close of 149.03 yen.
It ranged from 148.35-148.89 yen.
   Some brokers saw the stock rally as an indication that the
market had found its floor after a series of dizzying falls that
had knocked 14 percent off the market's value this year as of
Monday.
   ``The market is in the process of recovery,'' said Kazuhiro
Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   But not everyone was convinced. Economist Adrian Tschoegl of
SBCI Securities Asia said he calculates the market should fall
another 10 percent to reach a path of sustainable growth, in line
with its historical trend.
   ``But there's no way to know if the market will drop 10 percent
tomorrow or go sideways for six months,'' he said.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the stock market's strong
performance drove up the yen against the dollar.
   A dealer at Fuji Bank said the stock upturn dampened some of the
bullishness for the dollar.
   The Bank of Japan was rumored to have intervened several times
in support of the yen during the morning. The central bank does not
comment on its monetary actions.
   Some dealers said they believed the bank was taking new measures
to disguise its actions. On Tuesday, the central bank is believed
to have spent $2 billion in a futile attempt to raise the value of
the Japanese currency against the dollar.
   Prices of Japanese government bonds, which the Finance Ministry
has been attempting to bolster recently, weakened slightly in the
morning. That boosted the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond to
6.94 percent from 6.91 percent at Tuesday's close.

<HEAD>Regulator Says Serious Criminal Fraud More Likely at Failed S&amp;L</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serious criminal fraud is three times as
likely to occur at a failed savings and loan than at an insolvent
commercial bank, according to a top regulator.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who
also serves as head of a new S&amp;L bailout agency, the Resolution
Trust Corp., said about 60 percent of the thrifts seized by the
government over the past year have been ``victimized by serious
criminal activity.''
   In commercial banks, criminal fraud is present in 17 percent to
20 percent of failures, he told the House Ways and Means oversight
subcommittee Tuesday.
   ``If you can think of a kind of fraud, we'll be able to show you
(an example) in the S&amp;Ls,'' he said.
   However, a Justice Department official warned the panel not to
expect speedy recovery of taxpayers' losses on thrifts even though
the administration is spending $49 million this year on 202 FBI
agents and 30 trial lawyers to go after embezzlers.
   ``The investigation and prosecution of major financial
institution fraud typically will require ... many months or
years,'' said Mark M. Richard, deputy assistant attorney general.
   Moreover, much of the money is gone. The value of assets
involved in the fraud often has plummeted and ``the defendant may
have squandered his or her own assets, leaving little or nothing to
recover,'' he said.
   To speed the process, Richard said the Justice Department
intends in some cases to seek civil fraud penalties, which require
less proof than a criminal conviction.
   Meanwhile, Seidman defended his agency from criticism that it's
not moving fast enough.
   The panel chairman, Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, called the RTC's
progress ``damnably slow and hesitant.''
   Although the government over the past year has taken control of
382 insolvent thrifts with $192 billion in assets, it has been less
successful in returning the institutions to new private owners. So
far, it's sold only 49 thrifts and in most cases has had to keep
most of the assets.
   But Seidman said the RTC has had little-recognized success in
selling assets from thrifts before they are sold or liquidated. All
told in 1989, the agency sold assets or collected bad loans
totaling about $25 billion, he said.
   Separately, another bailout official announced a change in
policy aimed at speeding the sale of bankrupt institutions.
   William Taylor, acting chief staff officer of the RTC Oversight
Board, said Tuesday that thrift buyers in many cases now will get
up to a year to return loans, real estate and other assets to the
government.
   The previous limit of six months may have discouraged bids from
some potential buyers, who maintained they needed more time to
evaluate large, complex asset portfolios, he told the National
Council of Savings Institutions.
   The oversight board is the Treasury Department-led panel
controlling the policy and funding of Seidman's agency. Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., introduced legislation Tuesday to abolish the
oversight board, calling it ``a shackle around the neck of those
trying to solve the S&amp;L crisis.''
   In another development, a senior official of the Office of
Thrift Supervision resigned Tuesday.
   Karl T. Hoyle, the senior deputy director in charge of
congressional and media relations, left to form his own lobbying
company.
   He is the second top thrift office official to leave in less
than a week and his departure leaves three of the agency's top
eight spots vacant. Last Friday, Jordan Luke, chief counsel of the
agency, said he was entering private law practice.
   Thrift office director M. Danny Wall, under fire from Congress,
resigned Dec. 4 but continues to serve. The Treasury Department has
been unable to find a replacement.

<HEAD>Government Endorses Effort to Reduce Fat, Cholesterol</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government-endorsed report recommends an
ambitious effort by food companies, physicians and individuals to
improve health by reducing fat and cholesterol in the national diet.
   The result, says the expert panel that produced the report,
would be a 20 percent reduction in coronary heart disease.
   ``The American public should have a greater range of
low-saturated fatty acid, low-fat and low-cholesterol food options
available, and they should have the information to establish
heart-healthy eating patterns,'' said James Cleeman, coordinator of
the National Cholesterol Education Program.
   The NCEP report, endorsed by government agencies and 26 health
and professional groups, includes recommendations ranging from
nutrient consumption to standardized food labeling to educational
programs.
   Heart disease is the nation's No. 1 killer disease, claiming the
lives of about 500,000 Americans each year. It is associated with
high levels of cholesterol in the blood, which clogs arteries.
   The panel recommended a two-pronged approach, the first of which
seeks to identify and treat people at high risk of heart disease
with dietary therapy and possibly medication. Those people
generally have blood cholesterol levels of more than 240 milligrams
per deciliter.
   But more than 60 percent of the disabilities and premature
deaths associated with heart disease occur in millions of Americans
whose cholesterol levels are below that level, the report said.
   These people, as well as all Americans over age 2, would benefit
from the second part of the strategy, aimed at lowering cholesterol
levels by promoting healthful food choices and making food lower in
saturated fat and cholesterol more widely available.
   Of greatest importance in the diet, the report said, is
saturated fat from animal and vegetable sources. Saturated fats are
more important to overall blood cholesterol levels than the amount
of cholesterol consumed.
   Claims that foods with no cholesterol are healthier are
misleading because the food may contain high amounts of saturated
fat, said Dr. Richard Carleton, head of the Population Panel of the
National Cholesterol Education Program.
   He said no food is a ``magic bullet'' for lowering cholesterol,
and that eliminating a single food, such as egg yolks, which have a
high cholesterol content, is also not a solution.
   The report calls on the food industry to ``promote, label and
distribute good-tasting, safe foods'' lower in fat and cholesterol
and high in complex carbohydrates, including soluble fiber.
   It says the government should expand and standardize food
labeling requirements so consumers can have more information. The
Food and Drug Administration is drafting new food-labeling
regulations and legislation is pending in Congress.
   Other recommendations call on health professionals to advocate
healthier diets, for educational programs and continued nutrition
research.
   If the recommendations are heeded, ``large numbers of Americans
will be at lower risk of coronary heart disease,'' Carleton said.
   On nutrients, the panel recommends the same intake averages as
recommended by the American Heart Association and the National
Research Council. They include less than 10 percent of total
calories from saturated fat, an average of 30 percent of total
calories or less from all fat, and less than 300 milligrams of
cholesterol per day.
   The report was endorsed by the NCEP Coordinating Committee,
which includes the Department of Health and Human Services, the
Department of Agriculture and other government agencies, as well as
professional groups such as the American Medical Association, the
American Heart Association and the American Public Health
Association.

<HEAD>Judge May Sentence Dead Man to Let Lawyer Collect Bail Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge may sentence a dead man to prison
this week _ not out of any sense of moral outrage, but as a way of
enabling the defendant's lawyer to recover the $30,000 bail he put
up for his client.
   Before Santiago Alfred Gallegos was killed while awaiting
resentencing for sexually abusing a child, Morris Collins put up
the money with the promise of producing his client in court.
Gallegos, of course, never showed.
   So the game plan now appears to be to have a judge sentence
Gallegos on Friday, have defense attorneys ask for a new trial on
the grounds that their client was not present for sentencing, and
then have the prosecutor dismiss the charge.
   ``It's one of those queer deals where there is no provision in
the books for this,'' said District Judge Phil Chavarria Jr. He
said, however, he is not convinced the law allows him to send a
dead man to prison.
   Gallegos was convicted in 1986 and sentenced to eight years in
prison. The sentence was overturned on a technicality but the
conviction was upheld on appeal. In December, Gallegos, 54, was
found beaten to death in his home.
   Assistant District Attorney Ed Shaughnessy said the judge cannot
just dismiss the charge because the appellate courts have upheld
the conviction.
   On the other hand, said Harry Nass, Gallegos' current attorney,
Collins shouldn't be out $30,000.
   ``I think you'll find Mr. Gallegos was hit over the head with
blunt object. I think it is a logical presumption that he's not
voluntarily absent,'' Nass said.

<HEAD>Congressional Analysts Say Bush's Tax Proposals Fall Short</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A collection of tax changes that President
Bush says would increase collections by $13.9 billion next year
will, in fact, net only $9.4 billion, congressional analysts say.
   The projections by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office,
if accurate, would mean that Bush would fall $4.5 billion short of
his claim that his 1991 budget cuts next year's federal deficit by
$37.5 billion.
   Elsewhere, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the House's top tax writer,
said Tuesday he believes Congress won't be able to boost next
year's tax collections by the $13.9 billion Bush wants.
   The CBO projections obtained by The Associated Press showed that
Bush's 40 tax proposals would reap $13 billion in additional
receipts between 1991 and 1993. Bush's fiscal 1991 budget, released
last month, estimated that his proposed levy changes would bring
$29.4 billion into government coffers during that three-year period.
   In addition, CBO estimated that Bush's proposed changes would
actually cost the government $400 million in 1993 because he has
proposed creating so-called family savings accounts that would
offer tax breaks, and offering a series of tax advantages to
companies that conduct research.
   There were two chief differences between Bush's estimates and
the CBO's projections for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
   Bush claimed he would save $2.5 billion next year by making
unspecified improvements in the Internal Revenue Service's
efficiency. CBO said no savings would result.
   Second, Bush projected new collections of $4.9 billion next year
by cutting the tax rate on capital gains, a move he argues would
stimulate sales real estate and other property. Capital gains are
profits on the sales of those holdings.
   CBO estimated that the reduction would reap the government $3.2
billion next year. In addition, the congressional analysts said the
rate cut would lose from $3.1 billion to $4.3 billion for each of
the next four years. The Bush administration has argued that the
cut would bring in money to the Treasury each year.
   The Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law requires the use of White
House estimates of revenues and spending in determining the federal
deficit. CBO's figures are respected by many lawmakers for their
objectivity and accuracy, and are used as a benchmark to judge the
administration's numbers.
   Meanwhile, Rostenkowski's pessimism about the ability of
lawmakers to raise $13.9 billion in taxes makes it seem even less
likely that Bush and Congress will have an easy time of agreeing to
a budget for next year.
   The Illinois Democrat said that if his committee is told to find
$14 billion in new taxes, ``we're just not that good a magician,
unless we become very serious about reaching out for revenues that
are certainly going to be ducks.''
   The word ``ducks'' was a reference to Budget Director Richard
Darman's statement last year that Bush's pledge of no new taxes
applies to any levies the public would perceive as taxes. He used
the expression that if something walks and talks like a duck, it's
a duck.
   Bush has repeatedly promised to veto increases in such taxes.
Congress' Democratic leaders have said they will propose no tax
increases that will provoke a veto and leave their party as the
sole advocate of higher taxes.

<HEAD>Aspin: Bush Must Face Consequences for Choosing Weapons Over
People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush must face the likely
consequences of massive military layoffs because he favored weapons
over people, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee
says.
   ``Putting weapons before people was their decision and now
they're stuck with it,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., said Tuesday in
response to Pentagon outrage over congressional refusal to consider
a shift in defense funds.
   The Defense Department requested the authority to move $852
million from other accounts to personnel to avoid the dismissal of
tens of thousands of men and women by October. The cuts are
required under the Gramm-Rudman budget cutting law.
   But Aspin, with the backing of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash., declined to bring the request up before his committee,
informing the service chiefs and his committee colleagues in
separate letters dated Monday.
   Such reprogrammings of funds must be approved by each of the
House and Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees.
   ``If we don't stand firm now, this administration will have us
playing `chicken' with the budget every year, distorting the
deficit reduction process and relying on us to save it from its
more irresponsible excesses,'' Aspin said in a memorandum to his
committee members.
   Bush had the option of exempting military personnel from the
Gramm-Rudman law.
   Aspin said his committee is rejecting the budget ``shell game''
that Bush and White House budget chief Richard Darman are playing
with the military personnel account.
   But Pentagon officials lashed out at the congressional inaction,
charging that it will have ``an absolutely devastating effect'' on
military personnel.
   The Pentagon estimates that without the reprogramming authority,
44,100 to 68,200 military personnel would have to be fired by Oct.
1; between 32,500 and 32,600 people would be frozen in their
current jobs; 57,000 to 67,000 promotions would be delayed; and
59,900 to 115,900 fewer men and women could be brought into the
armed forces.
   There are about 2.1 million men and women in uniform.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams argued that Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney was directed by Congress in the fiscal 1990 defense
spending bill to request approval of the transfer.
   Williams quoted the bill as saying the request should be made
``to prevent a return to the 1970's phenomenon of the `hollow' Army
in which many units were substantially undermanned.''
   Williams said the Pentagon has been preparing ``dramatic
decreases'' in force size to be executed judiciously over a period
of years.
   ``You don't simply reach in and yank out a certain number of
people in the force,'' he said.
   Christopher Jehn, assistant secretary of defense for force
management and personnel, told the House Armed Services
subcommittee on military personnel and compensation that failure of
Congress to agree to shift funds would be a disaster.
   The director of the Congressional Budget Office, called before
the subcommittee to testify about reshaping the military, said the
Defense Department should be able to handle a quick reduction in
forces.
   ``It's do-able but extremely difficult,'' said Robert D.
Reischauer.
   The hearing focused on five alternative plans to restructure
U.S. military forces in light of the dramatic changes in Eastern
Europe and the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet agreement to reduce
strategic arms and conventional forces.
   The CBO alternatives would reduce the annual defense budget by
between $9 billion and $80 billion with cuts in active duty
manpower ranging from about 100,000 to almost 600,000.

<HEAD>Cranston Wants to Revive Public Campaign Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democratic Whip Alan Cranston, citing
his own tarnished image from the ``Keating Five'' scandal, is
encouraging his colleagues to revive public financing as a campaign
reform issue.
   ``So long as our elected representatives must depend on private
contributions to be viable candidates, our political system will be
suspect,'' the California lawmaker told the Senate Rules Committee.
   The panel, in a damage-control effort by both parties to the
growing public perception that Congress can be bought, is scheduled
to begin writing a campaign reform bill next week.
   Cranston's colleagues were courteous Tuesday, but his proposal
for using payroll tax-withholding system to collect $1-a-month
voluntary contributions as an alternative to private campaign
financing is expected to get scant attention.
   Sen. Wendell Ford, the panel chairman, said he expected few, if
any, changes to a bill that would set ``voluntary'' spending
ceilings using discount mail and television rates rather than
public campaign dollars as an incentive for compliance.
   Cranston's name was linked last fall with influence-peddling on
behalf of savings and loan operator Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Ford, a Kentucky Democrat, said then that he would run against
Cranston for the whip's post after November's election. However,
the race for the No. 2 party post in the Senate never came up in
Tuesday's hearing.
   Instead, Ford and fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell, a leading
Senate Republican on the campaign reform issue, patiently listened
as Cranston critiqued the present system's reliance on wealthy
contributors and political action committees.
   ``No matter how ethical we are, no matter how carefully we
evaluate our activities on our constituents' behalf, our dependence
on campaign fund-raising from private sources casts a shadow on the
ethics of us all,'' Cranston said.
   ``So long as any wealthy contributor benefits from any action a
senator takes, that senator can be accused of selling out,'' he
said. ``The only way to lift that shadow is to end our ...
dependence on private sources of campaign funds.''
   Cranston is one of five senators under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committee on charges they took a total of $1.3
million in campaign gifts raised by Keating and then interceded in
1987 with federal thrift regulators.
   The other four senators are John Glenn, D-Ohio; Donald Riegle,
D-Mich.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   At the time, regulators were moving against the Phoenix
millionaire's Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine,
Calif., which was taken over by the government in April.
   Regulators estimate that Lincoln's losses of federally insured
deposits to risky land investments and allegedly fraudulent loans
will ultimately cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.

<HEAD>U.S. Faltering as Other Countries Take Manufacturing Lead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is faltering as Japan and
other countries work to make their manufacturers competitive, a
congressional advisory agency said today.
   ``American manufacturing has never been in more trouble than it
is now,'' the Office of Technology Assessment said in a 231-page
report prepared for the Senate Banking Committee.
   The report rekindles a two-decade-old debate over industrial
policy and the government's role in private enterprise, with the
agency clearly siding with those favoring greater federal
participation.
   ``With few exceptions, the U.S. government has been reluctant to
adopt pro-active policies to build competitiveness,'' it said.
``The time is ripe for reopening the question ... before industry
is so weakened that national security is threatened.''
   Agency advisers suggested establishing a civilian technology
agency through the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
   ``Unless U.S. industry and government take coordinated and
timely action, there will be a long-term deterioration of our
industrial strength and military security, and an erosion of our
economic health,'' they said.
   The report acknowledged that selective government support of key
technologies or industries amounts to ``picking winners'' and that
government bureaucrats often are ill-equipped to make such choices.
   As an example, it cited the hundreds of millions of dollars the
now-defunct Synfuels Corp. spent in the early 1980s subsidizing
coal- and shale-based substitutes for oil and natural gas.
   But it said joint Japanese government-industry efforts have not
always enjoyed success.
   Among the Japanese failures cited were attempts at jump-starting
biotechnology development, building a fifth generation of computers
and erecting a civilian airliner industry.
   The dominance of U.S. civilian aircraft manufacturers in world
markets can be attributed to government-supported research on
airframe and engine technologies in the early part of the century,
the report said.
   ``A lesson is that a crisis is a poor crucible for making such
decisions,'' it said. ``The failure of the Synfuels project can be
traced largely to the atmosphere of crisis in which it was born.''
   The advisers also cited government support of agricultural
technology development through land grant universities and
cooperative extension services as being a key to the rapid
productivity growth of American farms.
   It is possible to ``take the best from the picking winners
debate'' and develop institutions for government collaboration with
manufacturers without becoming captive to them, the report said.
   ``The argument cannot and should not be resolved by counting up
successes and failures. Any sustained effort ... will include some
failures, and some industries might succeed more in spite of
government support than because of it.''

<TEXT>
   For the first time in 12 years, an
entertainment show beat ``60 Minutes'' in the ratings, and the CBS
program's executive producer says Andy Rooney's suspension ``played
a pretty big part.''
   ABC's ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' finished eighth in the
A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings for the week ended Feb. 25. ``60 Minutes''
was No. 18.
   ``For the first time since 1978 we lost the time period for a
broadcast other than a sporting event,'' Don Hewitt, executive
producer of ``60 Minutes,'' said in a memo to his staff Tuesday.
``What part the Andy Rooney affair played is anybody's guess. Mine
is that it played a pretty big part.
   ``Be that as it may, Andy will soon be coming back.''
   Rooney was handed a three-month suspension without pay three
weeks ago for racial remarks attributed to him by a gay magazine.
He was alleged to have said blacks had ``watered down their genes.''
   Rooney vehemently denied making the remarks.
   In 1978, the entertainment show ``ABC's Silver Anniversary
Special'' won the 7-to-8 p.m. slot against ``60 Minutes.''
   NBC won the ratings for the week with an average of 15.1,
followed by ABC with 13.7 and CBS with 13.4. The rating represents
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million TV homes.
   Here are the Top 10 shows, their networks and ratings: ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC, 23.6; (tied with) ``Cheers,'' NBC, 23.6;
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 21.5; ``A Different World,'' NBC, 21.0; ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC, 20.7; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 20.4; ``The Wonder
Years,'' ABC, 19.8; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 19.4;
``The 32nd Annual Grammy Awards,'' CBS, 18.9; and ``L.A. Law,''
NBC, 18.6.
   Peter Jennings' ``World News Tonight'' on ABC won its seventh
straight week in the news ratings, earning an 11.3. Dan Rather's
slumping ``CBS Evening News'' was third at 9.9. Tom Brokaw's ``NBC
Nightly News'' got a 10.1 rating.
   NBC's midseason prime-time replacement ``Grand'' was 11th, while
CBS' ``The Bradys'' _ an updated version of ``The Brady Bunch'' _
fell to 69th.
   Fox's ``Married ... With Children'' was No. 24 and the highest
ranked show for that network last week, with ``The Simpsons'' 26th.
Fox said it beat NBC and ABC with ``The Simpsons'' and CBS and ABC
with ``Married ... With Children.''
   Several specials did well, with ``The 32nd Annual Grammy
Awards'' capturing ninth place, and the middle and concluding
chapter of ``The Kennedys of Massachusetts'' taking 13th and 19th
places, respectively.
   The annual CBS broadcast of ``The Wizard of Oz'' on Tuesday
night was 27th. NBC's movie ``Nasty Boys'' ranked 37th in the
ratings, but the Friday night premiere of the ``Nasty Boys'' series
was No. 52.
   ``A Family For Joe,'' an NBC Sunday night movie starring Robert
Mitchum, was 22nd.
   Viewers agreed with critics and turned away from ABC's
``Challenger'' on Sunday night. The story about the shuttle tragedy
was 44th, with a 12.8 rating, a sharp drop-off from ``America's
Funniest Home Videos'' lead-in of 19.4.
   For the season to date, NBC leads the ratings averages with
14.9, followed by ABC with 13.0 and CBS with 12.3.
   The five bottom-ranked shows were: ``Primetime Live,'' ABC, 8.7;
``The Bradys,'' CBS, 8.5; ``Mission: Impossible,'' ABC, 7.7; (tied
with) ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS, 7.7; and ``Magical World of Disney,''
a showing of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' NBC, 7.5.

   A 1{-mile stretch of beach fouled
by oil from a ruptured tanker was reopened, and the Coast Guard
commandant praised the cleanup as a ``textbook case'' of how to
handle such spills.
   Thirty-five percent of the crude that leaked from the American
Trader on Feb. 7 was skimmed before it could go ashore, compared to
international averages of 10 percent to 15 percent, Adm. Paul Yost
said Tuesday.
   ``We had more oil skimmed percentage-wise than any other oil
spill in the United States,'' he said.
   A sandy 1{-mile stretch between Newport Pier and Balboa Pier was
deemed safe for beachgoers Tuesday after inspection of the sand and
testing of 74 samples for hydrocarbons, said city fire Capt. Ray
Pendleton.
   With 100 parts per million established as the upper limit, the
tests found an average of 14 ppm in the sand, he said.
   An additional 10 miles of Orange County beaches affected by the
Feb. 7 spill remained closed, but more openings were anticipated.
   The American Trader, whose cargo was owned by British Petroleum,
leaked 394,000 gallons of crude while mooring at an offshore oil
pipeline at Huntington Beach. The ship apparently was punctured by
its own anchor.

<TEXT>
   Riding a 700-foot geyser of fire,
shuttle Atlantis set the night ablaze in a dazzling sound-and-light
show as it rocketed into orbit early Wednesday on a secret mission
to put a spy satellite in orbit.
   After five postponements, the 100-ton spaceship thundered into a
clear sky at 2:51 a.m. and darted out over the Atlantic Ocean.
   Eight minutes and 40 seconds later, Mission Control Center in
Houston reported Atlantis was in a secure orbit.
   ``The flight engineer reports the main engine cutoff was
nominal,'' Mission Control reported as the spacecraft soared into
orbit more than 100 miles high.
   Once Atlantis reached orbit, NASA and the Pentagon placed a news
blackout on the progress of the flight. Unless there was a major
problem, only two announcements were planned, one about three hours
after liftoff that orbital operations had begun and another 30
hours into the flight with the date and time of landing.
   Atlantis and its crew of five military officers headed on a
northeast course skirting the East Coast.
   Officials said earlier that if skies were clear, the fiery
liftoff might be visible for hundreds of miles and that residents
as far north as New Jersey might see the rising shuttle as a
shooting star.
   Only three of the previous 33 shuttle missions began in darkness.
   The shuttle's course and launch time were determined by the need
to place a photo-reconnaissance satellite into position to observe
military bases and missile bases in northern regions of the Soviet
Union.
   Because the mission is classified, NASA and the Pentagon blacked
out the status of the countdown until the clock ticked down to nine
minutes.
   Two minutes into the flight, the two solid-fuel rockets burned
out and fell away, Atlantis continuing its climb into space on the
thrust of its three main liquid-fuel engines.
   The sixth delay tied the record for launch postponements by two
earlier shuttle missions.
   The launch had been delayed five times by bad weather, a cold
that felled Atlantis commander, Navy Capt. John O. Creighton, and a
faulty computer that halted the count Sunday just 31 seconds before
liftoff.
   Despite a forecast of high winds, shuttle managers gave the
go-ahead again Tuesday to proceed with the countdown and workers
pumped 528,000 pounds of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the
shuttle's external fuel tank.
   But the winds abated as the countdown advanced, and Atlantis
safely cleared the pad on blastoff.
   Low clouds and gusty winds early Monday caused the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to postpone the flight for the
fifth time. Shuttle managers then decided to put off for 48 hours
another attempt so that the astronauts and launch team could rest.
   The records for launch postponements were in 1986. Columbia
lifted off Jan. 12, after six delays caused by weather and
mechanical problems. Challenger's doomed launch on Jan. 28, came
after six delays, three as a result of the Columbia postponements
and three during countdowns.
   Atlantis was delayed twice because of weather and Creighton's
sore throat and nasal congestion. Weather alone caused two other
delays and a failed computer was blamed for one more delay. The
first attempt was last Thursday.
   The shuttle was expected to fly northeastward, a few hundred
miles off the East Coast. If the weather were clear, the launch
could be visible for hundreds of miles, as far north as New Jersey.
   Atlantis' launch path would put it in an orbit that reportedly
would cover a greater area of the globe than any other shuttle so
that its photo-reconnaissance satellite, once released by the crew,
could gather intelligence over northern areas of the Soviet Union
where there are numerous military bases and missile sites.
   The purpose of the four-day mission is secret, but sources close
to the project have said the astronauts were to deploy a
37,300-pound, $500 million satellite capable of taking super-sharp
photos and eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications
around the world.
   In covering most of the Soviet Union, the satellite would be
important in verifying Soviet compliance with arms control
agreements.
   Creighton, a Navy commander, is being accompanied in space by
Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission specialists
Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane
and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Atlantis' flight will be the 34th shuttle mission and the sixth
classified military flight.

<HEAD>Koop Says Officials Miss Chances for AIDS Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop is
criticizing Congress and his former employer for failing to come up
with a federal policy to deal with AIDS.
   ``There are ample opportunities'' for the White House and
Congress to develop an AIDS policy, Koop told a House panel
Tuesday. ``I think it's almost 10 years overdue.''
   ``My concerns this morning have yet to be addressed at a
national level,'' said Koop. He said later, ``It seems incredible
that the federal government has not had a dialogue'' with state and
local governments and insurers.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the health and
environment subcommittee, faulted President Bush for failing to act
on groundwork laid when Koop was surgeon general under President
Reagan.
   ``Having missed the opportunity to get the ounce of prevention,
we now have to pay for the pounds and pounds of cure,'' said
Waxman, who was hearing testimony on his proposed legislation to
expand Medicaid coverage for people with AIDS or infected with the
HIV virus believed to cause the disease.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Job-Training Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A private study says the nation's major
job-training program is not working the way it was intended, with
those who are least in need getting most of the help as Americans
who are troubled and discouraged are weeded out.
   The report, published by the Economic Policy Institute, a
union-backed think tank, said private contractors participating in
the Job Training Partnership Act are ``cream-skimming,'' or picking
promising candidates with skills over welfare recipients and high
school dropouts.
   But a Labor Department official said Tuesday that the report,
written by John Donahue of Harvard University's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, ``sounds like it's getting a little too
carried away.''
   ``We need to keep in mind that JTPA has been extremely
successful,'' said Roberts T. Jones, assistant secretary for
employment and training. He said 97 percent of those served are
defined by law as economically disadvantaged.
   Donahue's report suggested that JTPA is ``merely finding jobs
for workers who already are the best-equipped and most desirable to
employers'' rather than actually helping people develop long-term
skills.

<HEAD>PACs Raised $171 Million Last Year; Spent $132 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Election Commission figures show
Political action committees raised $171 million last year and spent
$132 million, with the Teamsters union PAC retaining its place as
the top PAC in both fundraising and spending.
   The FEC said in its analysis that the overall levels PAC
fund-raising and spending were little changed from the two years
ago but that contributions from PACs to federal candidates,
political parties and related election committees rose 24 percent
to $69 million last year compared to $56 million in 1987.
   Some of that increase can be attributed to the eight special
elections last year to fill congressional seats, an unusually high
number. The FEC said some of the increase also likely was
attributable to efforts by candidates and political committees to
retire 1988 campaign debts.
   The $171 million raised by PACs last year compared to $166
million in 1987, when total PAC spending was $122 million. In 1985,
the off-year before the 1986 congressional elections, PACs raised
$152 million and spent $112 million, with $45 million of that going
to federal candidates, parties or political committees.
   Critics of PAC influence on elections are lobbying heavily for
Congress to adopt limits on the amounts congressional candidates
could accept from political action committees. Congressional action
on the proposals is expected to begin in earnest next month.

<HEAD>Stocks Gain, Dollar Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today kept up
their strong recovery from Monday's severe plunge, while the dollar
ended a six-day climb against the Japanese yen after reaching an
eight-month high.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, the stock market's leading
indicator, gained 694.04 points, or 2.04 percent, closing at
34,591.99. Volume was a relatively heavy 700 million shares on the
first section.
   The gain followed a 576.08-point rise Tuesday, the day after the
index fell 1,569.10 points in its second-biggest one-day plunge
ever and its worst since the October 1987 ``Black Monday'' global
crash.
   Dealers said investors had regained confidence in the market
after a series of declines that had trimmed 14 percent off the
Nikkei's value by Monday.
   ``The market is in the process of recovery,'' declared Kazuhiro
Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Allowing for stability in the bond market, we are quite
confident that the market found its lowest point yesterday at
32,443.18 points on the Nikkei average,'' said Yutaka Nakai of
Daiwa Securities Co. ``Investors, especially individual investors,
feel increasing confidence.''
   The recovery apparently didn't come fast enough for someone in
Osaka, Japan's second-biggest city. Windows at seven brokerages
there were smashed overnight in what seemed to be an expression of
outrage, the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported.
   Meanwhile, not everyone was convinced the market had bottomed
out.
   Economist Adrian Tschoegl of SBCI Securities Asia said he
calculates the stock market should fall another 10 percent to reach
a path of sustainable growth, in line with its historical trend.
   ``But there's no way to know if the market will drop 10 percent
tomorrow or go sideways for six months,'' he said.
   Nakai cautioned that the yen-dollar rate remained a threat to
the stock market rally. The yen's recent weakness has been cited as
one factor making stock investment unattractive.
   The dollar closed today at 148.52 yen, down 0.51 yen from
Tuesday's close of 149.03 yen. It opened at 148.64 yen and ranged
from 148.33 yen to 148.89 yen.
   In the preceding six trading days, it had climbed a total of
4.51 yen, reaching its highest level since June.
   ``Today, the dollar appeared stable at 148 yen. But if the yen
weakens to 151-152 yen and Japanese authorities cannot raise the
(official discount rate) due to U.S. pressure, we do not see any
resistance line beyond that until 160 yen,'' Nakai said.
   The discount rate, the interest charged by the central bank for
loans to commercial banks, affects other interest rates. Some
analysts have expressed concern that higher interest rates in Japan
would draw funds back from the United States.
   ``We expected that the stock market rally might drive the dollar
below 148 yen,'' said Masafumi Koyama, chief dealer at the Bank of
Tokyo, ``but at 148.30 yen, there was a massive buy order that
drove the dollar back up to 148.60. It was quite a surprise.''
   Koyama said Japanese institutional investors were buying and
selling dollars with equal fervor.
   Japanese government bonds, which the Finance Ministry has
struggled to bolster lately, continued to weaken. The yield on the
benchmark No. 119 issue climbed to 7.03 percent, up from 6.91
percent Tuesday.

<HEAD>Fat Tuesday Now Ash Wednesday: Mardi Gras Over</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALBERTO S. FRANCO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The licentiousness of Mardi Gras gave way to
the austerity of Lent today as cleanup crews took back the streets
from the partyers to scoop up the litter that will tell how
successful the blowout was.
   ``The crowd's been unusually heavy, but it's been very
peaceful,'' said police Capt. George Bourgeois of the French
Quarter, where officers on horseback swept revelers off the street
as midnight turned Fat Tuesday into Ash Wednesday.
   The end of the party marked the first of 40 days of fasting and
penitence with which many Christians mark Lent.
   Once streets are clear, street cleaning trucks scoop up the vast
amounts of litter left after a day of partying and parades. The
trash tonnage _ one of the measures of Mardi Gras' success _ won't
be known for a couple of days.
   However, Capt. Paul Titus said after a helicopter flight over
the city that more than 1 million people were on the streets, as in
most previous years.
   An additional 600,000 to 700,000 enjoyed Tuesday's balmy weather
in suburban Metairie, with thousands more in other suburbs and
cities around southern Louisiana. Celebrations in heavily Roman
Catholic Louisiana began Jan. 6 and went into high geae than a week
before Tuesday's climax, which included 15 parades in New Orleans
and its suburbtightly packed crowd probably was at Bourbon Street,
as five women bared their breasts on different floors of one hotel.
Every so often, one would disappear _ apparently at the behest of
hotel security _ and reappear at another window to lift her shirt n
exchange for beads thrown from the crowd below the street, bodies
became so tightly jammed that it was impossible to move for 15
minutes. ``Can you believe that?!'' said a woman who squeezed into
the Sho Bar Striptease club, buying a drink so she could stay.
   Bourgeois said Tuesday's only injury was to a French Quarter
officer whose knee was hurt when his horse slipped and fell on
pavement slick from spilled booze.
   Parades in New Orleans started with the club called Zulu, whose
members _ blacks in blackface and grass skirts _ tossed painted
coconuts and spears along with plastic beads and big aluminum
Spanish-style doubloons. Next came the elegant procession of Rex,
the king of Carnival, followed by 150 home-built floats.
   ``It's New Orleans' mission to see to it that everyone in the
world has plastic beads, plastic cups and rubber chickens. The
stuff they throw from the pa good, but everyone wants it,'' said
Rita Miller of Metairie.
   Many in the crowds dressed up as Batman. Most of his imitators
had the full cape, tights and cowl, but Eric Wright's minimalist
approach _ a leather jockstrap with a plastic bat taped to it _
drew a crowd.
   Rick Ward, 21, of Albuquerque said someone ran into his parked
car and totaled it Saturday, and on previous days his wallet and
stereo were swiped from the car. But that didn't spoil his party
mood.
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``We're going to move here. All we have
to do is fly home and get reservations to fly back.''

<HEAD>Park Lighting Ballot Question Turns Ugly With Racist Flier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PIEDMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nearly all-white community voted to
allow lights at its soccer field despite a racist flier warning
that black youngsters from inner-city Oakland would be drawn to a
park for night games.
   Measure A had divided this wealthy city even before about 50 of
the fliers were placed on cars and homes Sunday night.
   But on Tuesday, voters overwhelmingly defeated the referendum,
which would have prohibited any new lighting at public playing
fields in Piedmont. There were 2,442 votes cast against the measure
and 1,421 votes in favor.
   No one took responsibility for the fliers, which said lighted
fields could draw ``black disadvantaged inner-city Oakland
youngsters, many from single head-of-household families and some
from drug rehabilitation programs.''
   Such youngsters, the fliers said, ``desperately need sports
areas that are easily accessible and free of drugs and gang
warfare.''
   A nonexistent group called ``Blacks for No on A'' was named on
the flier, which listed 37 apparently phony names.
   Mayor Susan Hill, who supported the measure, said the fliers
played on residents' fears. Only 1 percent of Piedmont's 10,450
residents are black.
   ``I think it's very discouraging and disappointing that someone
would distribute this type of material,'' she said. ``I don't think
that residents of Piedmont would be swayed by this type of hate
piece.''
   She added: ``The truth is that Piedmont is surrounded by
Oakland. Every newspaper shows the incredible crime rate and the
burglaries. Most crimes are drug-related. It's not a myth.''
   Robert Steinhorn, a leader of the Measure A campaign, said the
fliers were ``obviously a bunch of racist garbage'' intended to
make his camp look bad.
   The measure was placed on the ballot in response to plans by the
City Council to light a playing field until 8 p.m. for about six
weeks each year for night practice sessions of a community soccer
club.
   Neighbors said the plan would cause the values of their $300,000
homes to plummet.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Rules Transportation Union Members Can Withhold Dues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that transportation
workers who join unions have the same right as non-members to
refuse to pay dues that would be used to promote political or
ideological causes they oppose.
   The decision Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Paul V. Niemeyer
will make it easier for union members to demand rebates on their
dues, said attorney Milton L. Chappell of the National Right to
Work Legal Defense Fund.
   ``Most unions have taken the position in the past that any right
to pay a reduced fee only applies to non-members,'' said Chappell,
who brought the case on behalf of a Greenbelt woman who belongs to
the Transportation Communications International Union.
   Niemeyer said that for the union to use her dues for political
or ideological reasons violated her First Amendment rights and the
federal Railway Labor Act.
   Niemeyer issued the ruling under the Railway Labor Act, which
governs only the transportation industries, but it could set a
precedent for courts ruling on similar demands by other workers
unhappy with their unions' political activities.
   Other court decisions have held that non-union members working
in a union shop, where all workers must join the labor
organization, could reject union assessments for activities not
directly related to contract negotiations, grievance procedures or
other central functions.
   Mitchell M. Kraus, general counsel for the Transportation
Communications International Union, said the ruling was
disappointing, but he could not say whether the union, which
represents 100,000 employees, would appeal.
   ``To my knowledge, this is the first ruling of its kind,'' Kraus
said.
   The case was brought on behalf of Kathryn A. Kidwell, an Amtrak
secretary. She objected to her dues being used for purposes
unrelated to collective bargaining but said she did not want to
quit the union.
   In his decision, Niemeyer said Kidwell was faced with the
dilemma of staying in the union and having her money used for
causes she opposes, or leaving and giving up her right to vote on
the terms and conditions of her employment.
   ``In short ... she is given the option of protecting free speech
or of protecting her vote on the continuation or conditions of
work, but not both,'' the judge said.
   He ordered the union to give Kidwell and others similarly
situated the right to receive a reduction in dues.

<HEAD>Chamorro Family: Politics Stops At The Dinner Table</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: To CORRECT second Claudia to Cristiana, SUB 6th graf, `Pedro
Joaquin ... anti-Sandinista.' Picks up 7th graf, `Between them ...'
^By ELOY O. AGUILAR</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Divided by ideology and united by
strong family ties, the Chamorro family _ now led by
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro _ sums up the
complexity of Nicaraguan political life.
   Mrs. Chamorro was a housewife from the conservative region of
Rivas, in the traditional mold of the Nicarguan upper middle class
woman.
   She went from housewife to newspaper publisher when her husband
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro was assassinated, apparently by agents of
dictator Anastasio Somoza, on Jan. 10, 1978.
   The assassination turned Chamorro into a martyr of the
Sandinista revolution, which toppled Somoza 19 months later on July
19, 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro became a symbol of the revolution, joining the
junta that took over. Nine months later she quit.
   Pedro Joaquin and Violeta's children are evenly split _ Carlos
Fernando and Claudia are militant Sandinistas and government
officials; Pedro Joaquin and Cristiana are bitterly anti-Sandinista.
   Between them, the Chamorros run two of the three daily
newspapers in town _ the opposition La Prensa and the Sandinista
party paper Barricada _ which split off from La Prensa.
   The Chamorro children tear at each others' throats in print, but
at family reunions politics end at the dinner table.
   ``We are brothers and sisters with political differences. We
meet occasionally and we treat each other with respect,'' said
Cristiana, the youngest of the children at 30 and director of La
Prensa, which her late father turned into a constant political
critic of the late dictator Somoza.
   The family story became the center of attention again this week
when Mrs. Chamorro, heading an opposition coalition of 14 political
parties and other groups, defeated President Daniel Ortega's bid
for re-election, appearing to put an end to Sandinista rule.
   ``The same differences of political opinion we had in 1979 are
the differences we have now, but we have affectionate family
relations,'' said Carlos Fernando, who as director of Barricada
published articles that often ridiculed Mrs. Chamorro during her
presidential campaign.
   Yet the two embraced publicly as loving mother and son Monday
when Ortega visited Mrs. Chamorro to congratulate her on her
electoral victory.
   ``I have been a Sandinista for a long time,'' Carlos Fernando
said.
   A friend of the family, speaking on condition of anonimity said
of the Chamorros:
   ``They have one thing in common _ a conservative patrician sense
of unity of the family above everything else. After that, the
differences begin.''
   They are all children of Pedro Joaquin, publisher, guerrilla,
novelist and romantic whose constant attacks on Somoza eventually
brought him death on a street cornder in a hail of bullets.
   Many people like to speculate whether Pedro Joaquin would be on
the Sandinistas' side were he alive today.
   Carlos Fernando and Pedro Joaquin the younger studied in Canada,
but Carlos Fernando was the only one allowed to work as a reporter
at La Prensa while Pedro Joaquin was alive.
   ``Carlos Fernando inherited the social concerns and political
traditions of his father,'' said the friend of the family. ``Pedro
Joaquin inherited the business sense of the Cardenal family on his
paternal grandmother's side.''
   Pedro Joaquin eventually became director of La Prensa when it
was the target of government attacks in the early 80s.
   ``Pedro Joaquin was really afraid of the revolution,'' the
friend added. ``He and Cristiana really identified themselves with
the people opposed to the revolution. La Prensa then became a forum
for those people.''
   Claudia served as an ambassador for the Sandinista government.
   ``Conservative or liberal, they are fighters. Maybe Pedro
Joaquin and Cristiana are not the journalists that Carlos Fernando
is and they can't write worth a darn, but they were never afraid to
say what they thought.''
   The paper was closed by the Sandinista government several times
when young Pedro Joaquin was the director.
   The paper was closed for more than a year. Under international
pressure, Ortega once visited Mrs. Chamorro and told her she could
publish but the government would have to have a censor at the
newspaper.
   ``Then I won't publish,'' said Mrs. Chamorro, a stubborn woman
from a cattle region who once started a campaign speech, when
newspapers referred to her by her maiden name, by saying:
   ``I have on me the brand of the Chamorros.''

   The Contra rebels are refusing to
heed a call from Nicaraguan leaders and the Honduran president to
disband immediately, saying they'll wait until the newly elected
government in Managua takes office.
   Dismantling the U.S.-backed force has emerged as a critical
element in a peaceful transition in Nicaragua following the
opposition's stunning electoral triumph Sunday over the leftist
Sandinistas.
   On Tuesday, both Sandinista President Daniel Ortega and the
opposition president-elect, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, said the
rebels must immediately disband.
   ``The causes that started the civil war in Nicaragua have
disappeared,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a radio broadcast Tuesday
night. ``That's why those who took to the hills should now lay down
their guns and return peacefully to Nicaragua with their families
to work for the reconstruction of our motherland.''
   Earlier, President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras said the
Contras must leave Honduras as soon as possible.
   But Israel Galeano, the senior leader among the estimated 10,000
rebels in camps near Nicaragua's northern border, said they did not
trust the Sandinistas, who control Nicaragua's army and police.
   ``Our disbanding will take effect when the Sandinistas turn over
power,'' Galeano said. ``Meanwhile, we will remain in Honduras.''
   Galeano said in a telephone interview that the rebels would
remain in camps on the Honduran side of the border ``waiting for
there to be adequate conditions in Nicaragua for our return.''
   ``They (the Sandinistas) are capable of relinquishing the
government but not power or weapons to the winners of last Sunday's
election.''
   Galeano spoke after the call by Ortega to disband but before the
similar urging by Mrs. Chamorro, and it was unclear whether her
statement would affect the Contras' decision. Some members of her
coalition are former Contra leaders who returned to Nicaragua under
a government amnesty.
   After a six-hour meeting of Sandinista party leaders on Tuesday,
Ortega said the party would hand over power but ``defend the
integrity and professionalism of the army and the police forces.''
   ``The Sandinista National Liberation Front demands the immediate
demobilization and disarming of the Contras so there can be a
peaceful transition,'' he said, reading from a statement by party
leaders.
   Mrs. Chamorro is to take office for a six-year term April 25.
   About 10,000 Contra combatants retreated in March 1988 to
Yamales, 120 miles southeast of Tegucigalpa, after the United
States suspended military assistance and limited non-lethal aid.
   Since then, they have been living in camps on the Honduran side
of the border with Nicaragua, some of them with their relatives.
   In addition, an unknown number of Contras were in Nicaragua
right up to Sunday's election.
   Galeano said the rebels' 43 commanders would meet this week to
develop their strategy for the transition period.
   ``The Assembly of Commanders will decide on it (the strategy)
democratically but for the moment we are not willing to
demobilize,'' he said.
   Under a plan signed by five Central American presidents in
August, the Contras were to demobilize by December and turn over
their weapons to a verification commission. They did not.
   Galeano said he had ordered his troops to act only in
self-defense and not to attack Sandinista positions ``to avoid
armed confrontations that have no reason to occur at this time.''

<HEAD>Independent Journalist Says He Barred from UNESCO Conference</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent journalist Sergei Grigoryants today
said he was barred by authorities from traveling to Paris to attend
a U.N. agency conference discussing assistance for non-government
media in Eastern Europe.
   ``This shows what they really think here of the freedom of the
press, of the freedom of human contacts,'' Grigoryants said in a
telephone interview.
   Grigoryants, the publisher of the independent human rights
bulletin ``Glasnost'' and a former political prisoner, said he was
given a French visa to attend the conference of the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization after receiving a
personal invitation from UNESCO's director-general, Federico Mayor
of Spain.
   He was issued a passport at the Consular Service of the Foreign
Ministry, he said. But when he returned Monday to have it stamped
with the exit permit Soviets need to travel abroad, he said his
passport was confiscated.
   ``They told me they hadn't received permission from the
competent organs,'' Grigoryants said. ``That means the KGB.''
   He said leaders from official publications, such as Ogonyok
magazine editor-in-chief Vitaly Korotich and Vladislav A. Starkov,
editor of the weekly newspaper Arguments and Facts, had no problem
in obtaining permission to travel to Paris.
   As the UNESCO conference opened Tuesday, Mayor urged the West to
provide practical assistance to independent media in Eastern Europe
as journalists and broadcasters there help forge new societies.
   Media leaders from 15 Western countries including the United
States and Canada were attending the two-day conference along with
journalists from Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary,
Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union.

   Trustees of the Kimbell Art Museum, a
Louis Kahn design hailed by many as a shining example of modern
architecture, voted to postpone indefinitely a roundly criticized
plan to nearly double gallery space.
   Kimbell Art Foundation members announced in a statement Tuesday
they were putting aside the proposal they adopted in July to expand
the 18-year-old museum.
   Sue Ann Kahn, Kahn's daughter and a critic of the proposed
expansion, called the trustees' decision courageous.
   Kahn's survivors and others had objected to the expansion,
contending the Kimbell is a masterpiece that should not be tampered
with.
   Nine internationally prominent architects, including Phillip
Johnson, Richard Meier and James Sterling, wrote a letter in
November to the foundation president calling the proposed addition
``mimicry of the most simple-minded character.''
   The proposal mainly involved adding circular vault sections
similar to the original to both ends of the building. The $8
million plan would have added 14,000 square feet of gallery space.

   People along the East Coast glimpsed
ribbons of blue, white and red light across the pre-dawn sky as
space shuttle Atlantis streaked like a shooting star on a secret
military mission.
   ``It weaved in and out of the clouds. It was beautiful, very
bright. It had a long tail,'' said Theresa Yohn, a TV news producer
in Jacksonville, Fla.
   ``It was almost like another star, a white bright pinpoint of
blue light that continued upwards,'' said Mike Albertson, an editor
with the Savannah Evening Press who was staked out with binoculars
at Tybee Island, about 18 mile east of Savannah, Ga.
   Albertson described the shuttle's rocket boosters as ``twin
streaks of red side by side.''
   ``It was a great show. It's so incredible that something like
that could be bearing humans,'' he said.
   The 100-ton spaceship was spotted as far north as Washington,
D.C., in the minutes following the fiery liftoff at 2:51 a.m.
Clouds obscured visibility in some areas, however, as Atlantis
raced up the coast on the highest inclination orbit ever traveled
by a shuttle.
   ``At first, it was pretty much a white light,'' said Coast Guard
fireman Samuel Sellars, who watched from his station on Ocracoke
Island, just south of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   ``All of a sudden, it looked kind of like a flare. I thought
there had been another explosion,'' he said.
   Sellars soon realized he was watching the two solid-fuel rockets
burn out and fall away.
   ``For a moment, I was scared,'' he said. ``I feel kind of proud
now.''
   After lighting up the sky for miles around the Kennedy Space
Center, Atlantis ducked in and out of clouds on a northeasterly
course. The three main engines burned out east of Atlantic City,
N.J., and the shuttle headed toward Newfoundland.
   Wednesday's launch was NASA's sixth attempt to send Atlantis
aloft with its five-man, all-military crew and a $500 million spy
satellite. The previous efforts were scrubbed because of bad
weather, crew illness and a malfunctioning computer.
   Among those eagerly awaiting liftoff were doctors at an
emergency room who asked Ms. Yohn's newsroom to call them once the
shuttle took off.
   ``They couldn't stand outside waiting to see the launch. They
wanted to be able to run outside and watch it pass over, and then
run back inside to work,'' she said.
   ``It only lasted about 7 to 10 seconds. But it beat the hell out
of a fireworks show,'' Albertson said.
   It was the fourth nighttime launch for NASA. The last ascent in
the dark was Discovery's in November, but clouds obscured
visibility for most of the Southeast outside Florida.
   The evening launch of Atlantis in November 1985 was seen as far
north as Charleston, S.C. The other nighttime liftoff was
Challenger in August 1983.

<HEAD>Group Claims Responsibility for Attempted Bombing at IRS Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group calling itself Up the IRS Inc.
claimed responsibility for an explosives-laden truck parked outside
an Internal Revenue Service office, and it threatened more acts
against the tax agency.
   The claim was made in a letter received Tuesday by The Outlook
newspaper of Santa Monica. The attempted bombing Thursday forced
thousands of people to evacuate an area around the West Los Angeles
IRS office.
   ``As long as the IRS is used to extort such high, unfair and
ambiguous taxes from the populace using tactics more appropriate to
the SS or KGB, you and the government agencies can expect to see
more of these events and with increasing severity with successive
events,'' the letter said.
   A bomb squad disarmed the device, made of five 55-gallon steel
drums containing explosive chemicals. The explosives were in the
bed of a truck that had been set on fire.
   FBI spokesman Fred Reagan said a group with the same name
claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded in the area in 1988.
   In Tuesday's letter, Up the IRS Inc. said it timed the incident
to coincide with George Washington's birthday. ``George would have
applauded and had a good laugh at the distress of the thieves in
the IRS offices,'' it said.
   ``The truck was parked at that location for 48 hours and we
could have detonated it at any time.''
   There have been several bombings and attempted bombings of
Southern California IRS offices in recent years.
   An explosion and fire at a Glendale IRS office in 1986 caused
more than $1 million damage. Authorities defused four pipe bombs at
a vacant Culver City IRS office that same week.
   In 1987, authorities safely detonated pipe bombs found at a
Laguna Niguel IRS office.

<TEXT>
   A judge has heaped $450,000 more in contempt
fines on Operation Rescue, but a leader of the debt-ridden
anti-abortion group says he won't pay ``one dime.''
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward on Tuesday imposed a $100,000
fine against Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry and $350,000 in
fines against a chapter of the group and nine other people who
blocked women from entering clinics in New York City and nearby
counties.
   The judge said Operation Rescue violated his injunction against
blocking entrances to clinics where abortions are performed. He
also ordered the defendants to pay attorneys' fees, which have not
yet been calculated.
   ``This is selective and it's disgusting,'' Terry said. ``Where
else have there been fines like this for protesting? Not for animal
rights groups. Not for gay groups.''
   ``I have no intention of paying one dime of these fines,'' said
Michael McMonagle, an Operation Rescue deputy director who was
fined $25,000.
   Other activists also were refusing to pay their fines, The New
York Times reported today.
   Terry said the anti-abortion group, which has ignored $50,000 in
fines in other states, is more than $70,000 in debt. Debts forced
the group to announce Jan. 31 the closing of its national
headquarters in Binghamton.
   In Los Angeles, 15 Operation Rescue members were convicted
Monday on misdemeanor charges for a demonstration at a clinic last
March. They face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   McMonagle said of Tuesday's ruling: ``I'm afraid that it will
have a chilling effect on many people, but babies are being killed
and we have a moral obligation to save them.''
   The fines grew out of a lawsuit against Terry and his group by
the National Organization for Women and other abortion-rights
groups.
   Mary M. Gundrum, an attorney who worked with NOW, said the
contempt actions were pursued to ``give fair warning to those
persons and groups that the court will proceed to fine them if they
violate the constitutional rights of women.''

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
in calm European trading today, dealers said. Gold prices were
mixed.
   Currency dealers said the dollar was trading within a narrow
range, buoyed by weakness in the West German mark and the yen but
capped by concerns about the U.S. economy.
   A dealer at a West German bank in Frankfurt predicted the
dollar's upward trend would continue mostly because of persistent
yen weakness.
   Others said the markets were waiting for U.S. fourth quarter
gross national product data due for release later today.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.51 yen to a closing 148.52 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 148.68 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6915 West German marks, up from 1.6836
   _1.4875 Swiss francs, up from 1.4857
   _5.7235 French francs, up from 5.7010
   _1.9082 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8985
   _1,250.50 Italian lire, up from 1,245.25
   _1.1910 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1908
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6872, compared with $1.6915 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $408.75 a troy ounce, up
from $407.25 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $409.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $409.25, down from $411.25 Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.07 to close at a bid $408.92.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.13 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.11.

<TEXT>
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' is an oddsmaker's
slight favorite for an Academy Awards sweep: best picture, Morgan
Freeman as best actor and Jessica Tandy as best actress.
   Bally's oddsmaker Lenny Del Genio, who has put out Oscar odds
for eight years, made ``Driving Miss Daisy'' an even-money favorite
to win the best picture award, followed closely by ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' at 6-5.
   Freeman is an even-money pick to win for best actor, while Tom
Cruise is also listed at even money to win for ``Born on the Fourth
of July.''
   Tandy is even money to win the Oscar for her role in ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' while Michelle Pfeiffer is listed at 6-5 to win for
``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   Del Genio's odds are for entertainment purposes only, as Nevada
gaming regulators forbid betting on anything other than sports
events or horse races in the state's sports books.
   Del Genio said the odds for best picture were the closest ever,
reflecting a race that is very much up in the air going into the
Academy Awards show March 26 in Los Angeles.
   ``This year can go any way,'' he said. ``All of the nominations
for best picture are strong in their support.''
   Del Genio's odds in the top categories:
   Best Picture _ ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' even money; ``Born on the
Fourth of July,'' 6-5; ``My Left Foot,'' 3-1; ``Dead Poets
Society,'' 4-1; ``Field of Dreams,'' 5-1.
   Best Actor _ Freeman, even money; Cruise, even money; Daniel
Day-Lewis ``My Left Foot,'' 6-5; Robin Williams ``Dead Poets
Society,'' 3-1; Kenneth Branagh ``Henry V,'' 5-1.
   Best Actress _ Tandy, even money; Pfeiffer, 6-5; Jessica Lange
``Music Box,'' 3-1; Pauline Collins ``Shirley Valentine,'' 4-1;
Isabelle Adjani ``Camille Claudel,'' 5-1.
   Best Supporting Actor _ Martin Landau ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' even money; Denzel Washington ``Glory,'' 6-5; Dan
Aykroyd ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' 3-1; Marlon Brando ``A Dry White
Season,' 4-1; Danny Aiello ``Do the Right Thing,'' 5-1.
   Best Supporting Actress _ Brenda Fricker ``My Left Foot,'' 6-5;
Anjelica Huston ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' 7-5; Julia Roberts
``Steel Magnolias,'' 3-1; Dianne Wiest ``Parenthood,'' 4-1; Lena
Olin ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' 5-1.
   Best Director _ Oliver Stone ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
6-5; Peter Weir ``Dead Poets Society,'' 7-5; Jim Sheridan ``My Left
Foot,'' 3-1; Woody Allen ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' 4-1; Kenneth
Branagh ``Henry V,'' 5-1.

   Protesters hurling rocks
clashed with police as rival black factions fought for control of
black townships in Natal Province, police said today. At least six
people were reported killed.
   Two black men were killed and a third man was wounded when
police opened fire Tuesday on protesters who hurled rocks at police
patrols near Durban in the southeastern province, police officials
said.
   Rival factions set fire to houses and huts in several townships
and police used guns, rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse mobs
that attacked police patrols, the officials said.
   Four bodies of black men apparently killed in fighting between
rival black factions were found around Durban, police said. All of
the bodies had been set on fire, police said.
   The United Democratic Front is locked in a bloody struggle in
Natal with the conservative Inkatha Zulu political movement.
Hundreds of blacks have died in factional clashes in recent months.
   Black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela, released Feb. 11 after
27 years in jail, appealed at a rally in Durban in Sunday for an
end to the fighting. But more than 20 people have died in clashes
since the weekend with no sign of any halt to the fighting.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok, who heads the South
African police, said he was concerned about growing attacks on
police in Natal. He said police officers would be protected and not
prevented from enforcing the law.
   Seven police officers had been killed so far this year in Natal
and there had been 108 attacks on police officers in the province,
Vlok said Tuesday in Cape Town.

   High school seniors from other states,
apparently shaken by the Oct. 17 earthquake, don't appear as eager
to attend area colleges, according to school officials.
   The earthquake reversed a steady increase in freshman applicants
from outside California at Stanford University, Santa Clara
University and the University of California, officials said.
   The UC system had a record 19 percent drop in out-of-state
applicants for fall openings at its eight campuses.
   Including in-state applicants, UC Santa Cruz suffered the
steepest decline, with applications down by 11.8 percent. By
contrast, UC San Diego had the smallest decline with .05 percent.
   The epicenter of the 7.1-magnitude quake that killed 67 people
and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage was near Santa Cruz.
   ``A number of students back East told our staff, `I want to
come, but Mom and Dad don't want me to,''' because of the quake,
said Dan Saracino, dean of undergraduate admissions at the
University of Santa Clara, where the drop exceeded 6 percent.
   Stanford applications were off by 13 percent, officials said.
   Joe Allen, admissions director for UC Santa Cruz, said the drop
would be hard to explain except for the quake.
   Californians apparently did not let the quake change their
plans, however. In-state applications remained close to steady
despite a predicted drop in the number of 1990 high school
graduates.

<HEAD>Hot Time in Borrego, Cool in Gunnison</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 6th graf, He said, to CORRECT last word to winter sted

<TEXT>
   Folks looking for a hot time should head for
Borrego Springs, Calif., while Gunnison, Colo., is the place for
cool dudes.
   The Southern California desert community was the hottest place
in the nation 50 times last year, more often than any other
community, according to the annual rankings published by
Weatherwise magazine. Gunnison ranked as coldest place most often _
62 times.
   Officials in both towns see their weather as a boon.
   The piping-hot performance of 1989 moved Borrego Springs into
the top spot in the warm-weather sweepstakes, ahead of Palm
Springs, Calif., which led the list a year earlier.
   ``We're strictly a winter resort area. Our best time is October
to May,'' said Len Surles, secretary of the Borrego Springs Chamber
of Commerce. ``That's what brings people here, the mild
temperatures in the winter time, the lack of bad weather.''
   He said only about 2,700 people live all year in the town, about
90 miles from San Diego, but that can double in winter.
   While Borrego Springs was the national hot spot most often, last
year's hottest reading outside of Death Valley, Calif., was 121
degrees. That dubious distinction was shared by Blythe and Palm
Springs, Calif., on July 4 and Laughlin, Nev., the next day.
   Located high in the chilly Rocky Mountains, Gunnison was first
in frost for the fifth straight year, according to the analysis
prepared by David H. Hickcox, a professor of geography at Ohio
Wesleyan College in Delaware, Ohio.
   Winter sports are a feature at Gunnison, located in a valley
7,700 feet above sea level.
   ``It's a fun place to live. If you like the outdoors it's a
paradise,'' said Dale Howard, city manager of the community of
7,000 located 200 miles southwest of Denver.
   The low temperatures occur in the early hours of the morning
when cold air settles from the Rocky Mountains into Gunnison,
Howard said, adding that most days are sunny and that the
temperature warms up rapidly after sunrise.
   Last year's single coldest reading was 54 degrees below zero
Feb. 6 at Logan Canyon, Utah.
   Hickcox's analysis excludes Death Valley, Calif., from the heat
list and Alaska from the cold list, since the extremes recorded in
those places would nearly always dominate the standings.
   For the record, Death Valley had a maximum reading of 127
degrees July 7 and the top temperature there was over 100 every day
from June 6 to Sept. 18. Alaska had a numbing 76 below zero at
Tanana on Jan. 27, lowest reading for the year in North America.
The average for the month of January at Fort Yukon was 33.5 below
zero.
   Following Gunnison on the icy list was Truckee, Calif., the
coldest spot on 28 days; Fraser, Colo., 23 days; Leadville, Colo.,
20; and Wisdom, Mont., 19.
   On the sultry side of the statistics, Borrego Springs was
trailed by Bullhead City, Ariz., which was the hot spot 45 times
and then by dethroned champ Palm Springs, which was the sweatiest
place 33 times.
   Rounding out the fiery five were Laughlin, Nev., with 28 highest
readings and, tied for fifth at 27 days with the top torrid
temperature, were Laredo and McAllen, Texas.

   A neurologist who improperly signed more than 100
prescriptions for narcotics has been fined $390,000, the largest
amount in a civil lawsuit against a doctor for improper drug
distribution, the government said.
   The fine approved Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Andrew Caffrey
settled a lawsuit brought against Dr. Julian Ungar-Sargon.
   He was accused of leaving batches of signed prescription forms
for Percodan and Percocet, which are pain relievers, with
associates at the Manomet Medical Center in Plymouth, southeast of
Boston.
   Ungar-Sargon owned and operated the center in 1985 and 1986. At
that time, the government alleges, he was not authorized to write
prescriptions in Massachusetts and spent only a few hours at the
center every two weeks.
   ``There is no charge of illegal drug distribution at all,'' said
Ungar-Sargon's lawyer, Nancy Gertner. ``There are a host of
complicated regulations he did not follow.''

<HEAD>Foreign Journalists Seek Meeting With Gov't</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization representing more than 100
foreign journalists today requested a meeting with government
officials to discuss a recent increase in police surveillance.
   ``We strongly object to this interference in the journalistic
work of accredited foreign correspondents,'' the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Beijing said in a letter to Foreign Ministry.
   It requested a meeting with the ministry's director of
information, Li Zhaoxing, and ``representatives of relevant
security organizations at the earliest possible date.''
   The letter was delivered to the ministry today, and there was no
immediate response. More than 130 foreign correspondents from more
than two dozen countries belong to the organization.
   Police have sharply increased surveillance of foreign
journalists since martial law was lifted in Beijing last month.
Correspondents from nearly a dozen news organizations, including
Americans, Europeans and Soviets, said they have been tailed at
least once by plainclothes police in the past few weeks.
   One reporter said his Chinese friends had been warned by their
employers to stop seeing him. Three Chinese who visited another
reporter's home last week were taken away by security agents as
they left.
   Foreign journalists have faced reduced access to officials and
tighter controls since June, when the army was called in to crush
massive popular protests for democracy. Some have been tailed from
time to time, but surveillance has become markedly more intense
since Jan. 11, when martial law was lifted.
   Under martial law, foreign journalists were required to get
military approval for all interviews. Police surveillance appears
to be a substitute measure.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in Geneva to attend a disarmament
conference, said the reports of stepped up surveillance were
inaccurate and warned that any ``secret activities'' by foreign
journaists would prompt official response.
   As during past upsurges of conservative ideology, longstanding
official suspicion and resentment of all foreigners also has come
to the fore. A Western diplomat in Shanghai said security guards
recently accused his driver of being a foreign lackey and beat him
up.

<HEAD>Catholics Launch Petition Drive for Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Roman Catholics is seeking 100,000
signatures on a petition calling for major reform in the church.
   A full-page advertisement in today's New York Times calls for
the acceptance of women and married people into the priesthood,
development of Catholic Church teachings on sexuality, financial
openness and an end to the silencing of theologians.
   Among the 4,505 people who have already signed the petition are
a New York auxiliary bishop, Emerson Moore, prominent theologians
and a number of lay people, priests and nuns.
   Dan Dailey, head of the Chicago-based group Call to Action,
which placed the ad, said that the credibility of the church's
teachings on justice and peace would be undermined unless the
church's internal structure was changed.
   The group argues for more participation by Catholics at all
levels of the church, more outreach to racial and ethnic
minorities, academic freedom and consultation before choosing
bishops or closing of parishes and their schools.
   Reaction to the call for reform was mixed.
   Helen Hull Hitchcock, the director of Women for Faith and
Family, said it was ``deplorable'' for such a ``divisive''
statement to be released on Ash Wednesday, a solemn holy day. The
organization stresses strict adherence to church doctrine.
   The Rev. Kenneth J. Doyle, a spokesman for the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, sounded a conciliatory note.
   ``Some of these opinions we would identify with strongly, others
we would have some difficulty with,'' Doyle said.
   Dailey acknowledged that the Vatican would most likely frown on
the call for reform.
   ``But a year or two ago, nobody in their right mind would have
dreamed of the changes in Eastern Europe,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people chanting ``We
want freedom!'' took to the streets of this city today demanding
that Moslem-dominated Kashmir valley be granted autonomy from
India, witnesses said.
   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said local
Hindus and Sikhs joined Moslems in the procession through the city.
The witnesses said at least 300,000 of the city's one million
people joined the demonstration.
   ``We want liberty! We want freedom!'' marchers chanted, the
witnesses said.
   The movement for an independent Kashmir has mostly been led by
the area's Moslems, who form about 65 percent the population of
Jammu-Kashmir, the only state with a Moslem majority in
predominantly Hindu India.
   The four-decade-old agitation has flared in recent months.
   A government crackdown on the movement on Jan. 18 prompted
confrontations between demonstrators and security forces in which
at least 112 people have been killed.
   Witnesses said paramilitary police lined the route of the
procession but did not attempt to break up the demonstration. Most
shops in the city were closed in support.
   Kashmir, once a princely state, was divided between India and
Pakistan after the two countries were partitioned following the end
of British colonial rule in 1947. Srinagar and the surrounding
areas of the valley became part of Indian-held Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Moslems make up 12 percent of the 880 million population and
Hindus comprise 82 percent. Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists make up
the rest.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier campaigned for union with
Pakistan, which claims Kashmir because of its predominant Moslem
population, but now demand independence and the status of a neutral
nation.
   India has fought two wars with Pakistan over Kashmir and the two
nations have traded angry statements in recent weeks blaming each
other for the trouble in the valley.

   The public site for
watching space shuttle landings will be closed when Atlantis
touches down after its classified military mission, NASA said.
   The shuttle was launched from Florida early today, reportedly to
put a $500 million spy satellite in orbit. The landing time won't
be announced until 24 hours beforehand, but the mission is expected
to last about 4{ days, so Atlantis should land at this Mojave
Desert military base Sunday morning.
   During non-military shuttle flights, up to 500,000 people have
jammed onto the unpaved public viewing site on the east shore of
Rogers Dry Lake.
   But after secret missions ``it's been Department of Defense
policy to restrict the public from watching the landings,'' said
Don Haley, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   The rationale for the ban isn't clear, since news reporters and
photographers have been allowed to watch and photograph military
shuttle landings, and they have done so from a site closer to the
runway than the public viewing site.
   Those landings also have been televised, and the shuttle
landings are visible at a distance from portions of Highway 58
north of Edwards Air Force Base.
   Haley said the viewing site will be open after the next shuttle
flight, when Discovery lands after a five-day mission to put the
Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around the Earth. Discovery is
scheduled for launch April 12.

<TEXT>
   The wrong dog was on death row but his
master's voice saved him from destruction.
   The dog Bud Lite was to be destroyed by lethal injection at the
Genesee County animal shelter for biting a 12-year-old boy.
   But authorities say Bud Lite had done no wrong and was the
victim of an insidious dog switch.
   A 20-year-old woman, who wasn't identified, had agreed to have
her dog put to sleep for biting the boy in exchange for dismissal
of a misdemeanor charge against her, City Attorney Richard Hamilton
said Tuesday.
   Officials in this community about five miles east of Flint said
they are investigating this possible scenario: The woman snatched
Bud Lite from his yard, switched his collar and tags with her
doomed dog's tags and turned him in to the shelter.
   Bud Lite, owned by 14-year-old Jason Griffin, resembles the
condemned dog and lives about a mile away. Court records described
the offending dog as a brown pit bull; Bud Lite is a pit
bull-retriever mix.
   ``In the 16 years since I've been doing this, this is a first,''
Assistant City Attorney Rick Austin said. The woman, if guilty of
switching the dogs, could face a charge of larceny, he said.
   Bud Lite was missing for several days before Jason's mother,
Kathy Johnston, checked the Genesee County animal shelter.
   ``She peeked into death row and said, `There it is. That's my
dog,''' said Jeff Johnston, Jason's stepfather. ``The (animal
shelter) woman said, `That can't be your dog. That's a
court-ordered destruction. Some other woman brought that dog in.'''
   Police confirmed that Bud Lite was the wrong dog.
   The woman is scheduled to appear Thursday before District Judge
Gerald D. Snodgrass.
   Her dog remains at large.

<HEAD>Prosecution Won't Seek Charges Against Former Korean President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors said today they would not
seek an indictment against former President Choi Kyu-hah. The
legislature had sought criminal charges after he refused to testify
about a civil uprising in 1980.
   Senior prosecutor Park Soon-yong cited executive privilege and
national security concerns in making the decision.
   Choi, a former prime minister, briefly served as a figurehead
president after the assassination of his predecessor Park Chung-hee
in late 1979. He was succeeded by Chun Doo-hwan who seized power
with military backing in 1980.
   The National Assembly sought criminal charges against Choi early
last month after the ex-president ignored five subpoenas to testify
on his alleged role in the military crackdown on a pro-democracy
movement in the southern city of Kwangju in 1980. About 200 people
were killed and more than 1,500 injured in the 10-day uprising, the
worst in modern Korean history.
   A special Parliament committee investigating the tragedy
summoned Choi to testify on the incident, but he refused to, citing
executive privilege.
   When Chun was subpeoned late last year, he testified before in a
raucous session that shed little light on his role in putting down
the uprising.

<HEAD>University Student Finds Egyptian Mummy in His Bed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A college freshman was shocked when he
returned to his dorm room and found his bed had been occupied by
someone dead for a long, long time. The body was a 2,500-year-old
unwrapped Egyptian mummy.
   The mummy had been swiped from its Wesleyan University hiding
place and slipped into Tim Abel's bed as a practical joke, campus
public safety officials and Abel said Tuesday.
   Abel said he had returned to his dorm room Saturday night to
find a crowd gathering and a prankster trying to spirit a body
away. Abel grabbed the body to see if it was real, and was
disgusted to find flakes chipped off in his hand. The prankster,
whom Abel declined to identify, fled, clutching the body.
   ``It was one of the most putrid things I've ever seen,'' said
Abel, of Wilmington, Del. ``I looked at my bed and there were all
these skin chips and little chips in it. It was pretty disgusting.''
   The espisode is being investigated by Middletown police and
campus security officers. Wesleyan President William M. Chace
promises to make sure the mummy receives proper care and respect, a
school spokesman said.
   A Wesleyan classics professor bought the mummy in Athens in the
1880s, at a time when pilfering Egyptian tombs was popular. The
5-foot, 2-inch body was displayed at the university's natural
history museum until the 1950s, when interest in mummies waned and
it was stored in a library attic.
   University scholars decided in 1978 to study the mummy further.
An X-ray showed it was a young man with four mysterious tubes in
his tummy.
   The mummy was unwrapped and sliced open a year later in the
university's archaeology lab. The tubes showed traces of organic
matter, leading the scholars to conclude that bits of organs
removed from the body during mummification had been sewn back to be
reunited with the body in the afterlife.
   Inscriptions on the bandages and other evidence led to the
conclusion that the mummy had been a scholar and a member of
Egypt's priestly class who died in his early 20s.
   Since then, the mummy had been wrapped in plastic and stored in
a wooden crate. After its surprise appearance in Abel's room, it
was returned to its climate-controlled resting place in a campus
building.

<HEAD>No Concessions Until Conditions Are Met, Says Mandela</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANGUS SHAW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela today reiterated that the
African National Congress will not hold talks with the South
African government until South Africa's white leaders meet
long-standing conditions.
   Those conditions include lifting the 3{-year-old state of
emergency and a general amnesty for exiles selected to take part in
preliminary talks with South African President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``The simple position is that until South Africa complies with
the preconditions we have set, the ANC is not in the same position
as the National Party'' of de Klerk, Mandela told reporters after
meeting with seven African presidents and Commonwealth leaders in
Lusaka.
   Whatever political or security problems the government faces in
South Africa, the ANC ``cannot be expected to make any
concessions,'' he said.
   Mandela was on the second day of a visit to Zambia, where he met
with exiled ANC leaders at their external headquarters.
   It was his first trip out of South Africa since a clandestine
border crossing in 1962. Later that year, Mandela was jailed for
plotting against the South African government. He was freed Feb. 11.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC Feb. 2, but Mandela demanded a
general amnesty for ANC exiles to prevent them from being
prosecuted if they entered South Africa to take part in talks. He
said the legalization of the ANC might not protect all exiles from
prosecution for certain offenses.
   The refusal to accommodate the ANC demands showed ``it is quite
clear the government is not yet prepared to meet us,'' Mandela said.
   Mandela compared the situation of South Africa's black majority
to that of Palestinians in Israel, saying: ``We live under a unique
form of colonialism in South Africa as well as in Israel.''
   He defended his support of PLO leader Yasser Arafat, who arrived
in Zambia on Tuesday to meet with him, and also defended the ANC's
support of continued economic sanctions against the South Africa
government to pressure it to lift apartheid.
   Britian's unilateral decision to lift an investment ban will be
taken up directly by the ANC with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
he said. Thatcher has argued that sanctions hurt South Africa's
blacks the most, and she said easing sanctions would encourage de
Klerk to press ahead with reforms.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, one of the ANC's staunchest
suporters, said Mandela met with leaders of the six black African
Frontline nations surrounding South Africa, and with members of a
nine-nation committee on Southern Africa set up by the Commonwealth.
   The Commonwealth leaders and the Frontline nations _ Angola,
Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe _ endorsed the
ANC's policy on economic sanctions and agreed there should be no
immediate easing of punitive measures.
   Mandela is on an 18-day, four-nation tour that will also take
him to Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Sweden.

   Preliminary returns indicated that the
governing National Front coalition and a Hindu fundamentalist group
gained seats in elections for eight state legislatures, news
reports said today.
   At least 88 people were reported killed in violence related to
the voting.
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party, which had
controlled all eight legislatures suffered heavy losses in
Tuesday's balloting, the early returns indicated. The Congress
Party won only seven of the 33 races decided, United News of India
said. A total of 1,610 seats were at stake.
   Widespread fraud was reported in the balloting, and the federal
Election Commission said that voting was repeated in 400 election
centers today because of the violence and ballot-stuffing.
   Tuesday's elections were seen as a test of whether Prime
Minister V.P. Singh, Gandhi's successor, could consolidate the
gains made by his National Front coalition in November's
parliamentary elections. They were also a test for the increasingly
popular Hindu fundamentalists, the Indian People's Party.
   United News of India said four people were killed today in
Haryana state when police opened fire on a crowd protesting alleged
vote fraud.
   On Tuesday, 84 people were killed and 250 injured in violence
set off by the voting, eight in the eastern state of Bihar. At
least two people were killed in western Gujarat, the Times of India
said. An election official died of a heart attack during the voting
in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh.
   Bihar, India's poorest state, is notorious for its organized
criminal gangs, which appear to multiply during elections. Many
candidates seek their support and privately acknowledge the gangs
can achieve more successful results than traditional canvassing.
   The latest killings raised to 102 the number of deaths in
election violence since the campaign began Jan. 24.
   At least 150 million voters cast their ballots Tuesday to elect
legislatures in eight of India's 25 states.
   About 213 million voters were registered for the polls in
Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan states spanning the
breadth of India's diverse geography from the western deserts to
the foothills and mountains of the northern Himalayas.
   Elections were also held for 30 constituencies in Pondicherry, a
federally administered territory in the south. They were also held
in five national parliamentary constituencies and 17 other state
assembly constituencies where elections were either countermanded
or byelections were due.
   United News of India said the right-wing Indian People's Party
was ``maintaining comfortable leads'' in Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan, while the National Front ``continued to consolidate its
position in Orissa.''
   The Hindu group supports the National Front government but is
running its own candidates in some elections.
   In Gujarat, the National Front and Indian People's Party were
leading in 128 of the state's 182 constituencies where results were
available.
   A pre-election survey, published in the latest issue of the
influential magazine ``Sunday,'' said the Congress Party was likely
to be voted out of power in all eight states. Political analysts
say the Congress Party will face large-scale defections after the
elections.

<TEXT>
   Predictions of imminent doom for the East
German economy have fallen off in recent days as March 18 elections
draw nearer and the country's currency surges against the powerful
West German mark.
   Boosted by expectations of a favorable exchange rate once the
West German currency becomes legal tender in both countries, the
East mark rocketed by as much as 30 percent in black market trading
Tuesday to 21.50 West German marks for every 100 East marks,
currency traders in West Germany and Austria said.
   Before West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced plans Feb. 6
to fuse the two German economies in a monetary union as a first
step to political unification, the unofficial traders paid out only
14 to 18 West German marks for each 100 East marks.
   The dire predictions prompted Bonn to offer monetary union and
accelerate political unification.
   Explaining the East Mark's surge, Reinhard Pohl, a monetary
expert at the German Economic Research Institute in West Berlin
said some West Germans have been trading their convertible
Deutschmarks at the favorable black-market rate of about five to
one, then giving the East German marks to relatives or friends in
East Germany in hopes they can be traded back at one- or two-to-one
after currency union.
   Bonn officials have sought to discount speculation that West
Germany's central bank would buy East Germans' estimated 17 billion
marks of savings at a one-to-one ratio, but no final decision is
expected on the exchange rate until after the elections.
   A one-to-one exchange would cost West Germany billions and raise
the possibility of high inflation, something that postwar West
Germany has worked to avoid.
   Nevertheless, many West Germans consider drastic economic
assistance for East Germany necessary to staunch the flow of
thousands of East Germans to the West. The immigrants have strained
West German housing and social services.
   On Tuesday, a small East German party backed by Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union called for postponement of the vote because it
said election rules hadn't been released in time to allow a fair
fight for the 400 parliamentary seats to be decided.
   The rules were printed and made available to bookstores Friday
but did not appear in newspapers.
   The German Social Union is a member of a conservative coalition
that originally pushed for East Germany's first free elections to
be advanced from the original date of May 6, in part out of fear
that neither the Communist-led government nor the economy could
hold out that long.
   Some larger parties, including the Communists, have political
networks with offices, telephones, vehicles and other advantages
not available to new groups that have sprung up since a peaceful
popular revolt toppled hard-line Communist leaders last fall.
   Even so, the clear leader is the Social Democratic Party,
founded less than five months ago and supported by a sister party
that is West Germany's main opposition.
   Polls of East German voters predict the Social Democrats will
get at least 50 percent if the elections are held on March 18.
   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union supports the German Social
Union, East Germany's Christian Democrats and the Democratic
Awakening, which are joined in conservative alliance.

<TEXT>
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole says he's not
giving up his effort to gain approval of a measure to mark the
deaths of hundreds of thousands of Armenians during in the reign of
the Ottoman Empire.
   The Kansas Republican, who lost a second procedural vote in the
Senate, said Tuesday that he might introduce the controversial
resolution in another form.
   The measure, which designates April 24 as ``National Day of
Remembrance of the 75th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
1915-1923,'' has created a firestorm in Turkey, where officials
strenuously object to the use of the word genocide.
   The Turkish government praised the setback to the resolution.
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., waged a filibuster against the
resolution last week, arguing the measure could seriously
jeopardize U.S. relations with Turkey.
   The Senate refused by a 51-48 vote to cut off debate.
   Dole said Americans of Armenian heritage deserved to be
recognized for their suffering, and called the resolution a human
rights issue.
   The alleged genocide occurred before the birth of the Republic
of Turkey. Armenians say 1.5 million were killed because of their
race.
   Turkish officials dispute the alleged genocide. They say some
600,000 people, including Muslims and Christians were killed in the
turbulent times because of civil strife and marauding bands.
   The Bush administration opposed the resolution, but Dole said
Tuesday that White House officials would not object to softening
the language in the measure and making it a concurrent resolution.
Bush would not have to sign such a measure.
   In Ankara today, Murat Sungar, spokesman for the Turkish Foreign
Ministry, praised the Senate's action, saying: ``We note with
appreciation the fact that an important number of the esteemed
senators acted with composure, prudence and foresight, refusing to
condone the distortion of historical realities.''
   Sungar said that adoption of the measure ``would have negative
effects on bilateral ties as well as shaking the stability of the
region.''

   President Bush signed a proclamation today

   ``This horse is uniquely ours, having been developed in colonial
America and bred for speed,'' said Bush.
   ``No other horse is a greater part of Western folklore, and none

   The American Quarter Horse Association, founded by a group of
ranchers in the Southwest, is marking its 50th anniversary on March

   Sales of existing homes fell 2.2 percent last
month, pulled down by higher mortgage interest rates combined with
the usual January buying lull, a real estate trade group reported
today.
   The National Association of Realtors said January sales totaled
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.48 million units, the
slowest since last August's 3.44 million rate.
   Interest rates rose from 9.83 percent to 10.05 percent last
month, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   ``The rate rise made a dent, in high-end and less-expensive
markets,'' said Realtors President Norman D. Flynn, who also noted
that the beginning of a year is generally a slow home sales period.
   NAR chief economist John A. Tuccillo said a big increase in
sales is unlikely in the coming months because of the mortgage
rates, but added that ``as rates taper off in the spring, we expect
sales to pick up, mainly in markets offering moderately priced
homes.''
   The national median price for existing single-family homes last
month was $96,200, up 4 percent from December and 7.1 percent from
January 1989. The median means half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   The South was the only region posting an increase in sales in
January, up 0.7 percent to 1.40 million units. The median price
there was $86,300.
   The biggest decline in sales was in the West, where the
540,000-unit pace was 11.5 percent below the December rate. The
median price was $144,000, up 7 percent from January 1989 but a
smaller increase than recent annual price hikes in the region.
   ``The high priced, high-volume markets on California's West
Coast cooled down,'' Tuccillo said.
   Sales in the Northeast were down 3.4 percent to 560,000 units.
The median price there was $147,100, prompting Tuccillo to observe
that ``high-cost areas in the Northeast remain sluggish and this
likely will continue through the year.''
   The Midwest resale rate of 960,000 units was 2 percent below the
December pace. The median price there was $74,6000.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will probably
reject U.S.-backed compromises aimed at starting peace talks with
Palestinians because of stiff resistance within his Likud bloc,
Vice Premier Shimon Peres said today.
   Peres, the head of the left-leaning Labor Party, spoke in an
interview amid a widening rebellion against Shamir by hard-liners
in his right-wing bloc.
   Former Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, who quit the Cabinet two
weeks ago to protest Shamir's policies, has threatened to convene
Likud's decision-making Central Committee next week without the
prime minister's consent.
   Other Likud lawmakers said they would support a vote of no
confidence against Shamir if he agrees to a U.S.-backed formula
that would include Palestinians from east Jerusalem or Palestinian
deportees in peace talks.
   Asked if he thought Shamir could overcome the differences and
move Middle East peace efforts ahead by accepting compromises
proposed by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Peres said:
``I have my doubts.'' Baker has been attempting to bridge
differences between Israel and Palestinians over the composition of
a Palestinian delegation for preliminary peace talks in Cairo.
   The talks are to focus on Israel's plan for elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip that would lead to limited
self-rule for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands.
Hundreds of Palestinians and about 40 Israelis have been killed
during the last 27 months in a Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the territories.
   Peres, whose party agrees to Baker's suggestions, has given
Shamir a March 7 deadline to approve them. ``We are nearing the
real decision now.'' Peres said. ``In a week or so we shall see
what is happening.''
   He described the current crisis as ``more serious than previous
ones'' and added: ``From the Likud point of view, they have reached
the point where they have to make up their mind.''
   Peres indicated that Labor would leave its coalition with Likud
and try to form a new government with smaller religious and
left-wing parties if Likud continues to balk at peace efforts.
Asked whether he was ready to form a new Cabinet, Peres said,
``Maybe, I don't exclude it.''
   The Hadashot daily quoted Peres as telling party activists
Tuesday he could put together a narrow government within 10 days if
Shamir's government falls.
   Peres also told The Associated Press that if he forms a new
government, he will continue to back the Israeli elections plan
rather seek a new peace formula. ``If there was a new government it
would stay with the current approach,'' Peres said.
   Baker's compromise on the composition of a Palestinian
delegation calls for including Palestinians from east Jerusalem and
some deported by Israel in preliminary Cairo peace talks, Israeli
newspapers said. They also call for Egypt to announce the names of
the delegates and for the agenda to be left open to allow
Palestinians to bring up subjects other than the elections.
   Including Palestinians from east Jerusalem has been a major
sticking point for Likud, which fears such a move would undercut
Israel's claim to the entire mixed Jewish-Arab city as its capital.
   Israel annexed the Arab sector after capturing it from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``I'm not sure east Jerusalem is the only issue,'' Peres said.
``They (Likud) think it's the wrong way to go.''
   Likud fears that some of the proposals could lead to indirect
involvement by the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization. It also opposes any land-for-peace settlement, which
the United States and Labor would accept.

   Brush fires driven by high winds burned
on this Mediterranean island today, but the Atlantic storm that
raked Europe and killed at least 53 people began losing strength
over most of France.
   In eastern Nancy, a motorist died when he was blown off an icy
road late Tuesday into an electricity pylon.
   The 74 mph winds that struck northern France on Monday reached
the Mediterranean Tuesday, turning small fires on the sun-parched
island into major conflagrations. Firefighters evacuated 800 people
late Tuesday from the villages of Folelli and Moriani-Place as
flames neared their communities.
   Residents returned home early today as the blazes were brought
under control. But new fires broke out at Valle D'Alsani de Zuani,
Poleroso, Santa Maria Di Lota and Farinole.
   Winds estimated at 93 mph prevented aircraft in Marseille from
aiding firefighters on the ground. Many islanders remained without
electricity or telephone service.
   Conditions, meanwhile, returned to relative calm in northern
France, with winds dying to 56 mph in Normandy and floodwaters
rolling back from some coastal areas.
   In Britain, raging seas whipped up by the storm surged through a
shattered sea wall and swamped homes in Towyn, Wales on Tuesday.
Rescue workers wearing rubber wet suits and traveling in
flat-bottom boats helped evacuate 2,000 residents stranded by water
five feet deep.
   Twenty-five people were hospitalized for treatment of
hypothermia, and some people who ventured out to retrieve
belongings from their homes had to be rescued by helicopter as the
tide rose along the north coast of Wales.
   The storm knocked a hole 2,000 feet long in the century-old sea
wall.
   Fifty-three deaths have been reported in Europe since the storm
struck Monday: 17 in Britain, 12 in West Germany and three in East
Germany, 11 in France, five in Belgium, two in Switzerland and one
each in Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.
   In Switzerland, violent winds disrupted rail and road traffic
and caused widespread tree damage and power outages Tuesday,
authorities said. On Jungfraujoch, 11,340 feet up the Bernese
Oberland, winds reached 140 mph.
   The main north-south rail link through the Gotthard tunnel was
interrupted, as were many other sections of the Swiss electrified
network because overhead lines were cut. Swiss radio said it was
the worst blow to rail traffic in decades. It said that even in the
region of Zurich, Switzerland's most populous city, winds blew at
up to 92 mph.
   In the north of Britain, driving snow and 120 mph winds hampered
efforts to reach an injured climber, later found dead in his
survival bag.
   Throughout Britain, volunteers and rescuers faced similar
perils, exacerbated by power outages affecting 40,000 homes, road
and rail disruptions and fears of sewage contamination and gas
leaks caused by damaged pipes.
   A 32-year-old West German man and his 6-year-old son were feared
drowned today after their dinghy was found capsized by the storm
off a southern Denmark island on Monday, police in Copenhagen said.
The two had gone fishing near Nordborg on the island of Als. Police
abandoned the search for the bodies of the two, who were not
identified, police said.

<HEAD>Economy Up 0.9 Percent in Fourth Quarter, 3 Percent for Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 10th graf, An inflation, to CORRECT inflation increase
to 4.5 percent for the year and provide quarterly revision from 3.8

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew by 0.9 percent in the
fourth quarter of 1989, faster than previously estimated but still
the slowest pace in more than three years, the government said
today.
   The Commerce Department said its revised estimate of
October-December growth means the gross national product _ the
nation's total output of goods and services _ rose 3 percent for
all of 1989.
   That was the slowest yearly advance since a 2.7 percent gain in
1986 and followed a 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   The fourth-quarter gain was stronger than the initial report
last month of 0.5 percent growth, but was still the lowest since a
0.8 percent advance in the third quarter of 1986.
   A consensus of economists had indicated in advance of the new
report that fourth-quarter growth would be lowered to 0.4 percent.
   The improvement should ease fears the economy had entered a
downturn at year's end, although there is considerable anxiety over
the months ahead.
   The department will make one more revision in the GNP _ the
broadest measure of the nation's economic health _ after more solid
information is available next month.
   A recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly
declines in the GNP. The last decline was a one-quarter drop of 1.8
percent in 1986, after which the economy resumed growth. The last
recession occurred in 1981-82.
   Since then, the economic expansion has continued for 87 months
and in November broke the peacetime growth record. If it continues
through October 1991, it will set a new overall record.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose 4.5 percent last year,
the report said. The fourth-quarter figure was revised downward
from the 3.8 percent annual rate reported initially to 3.6 percent
today.
   Some economists, including Chairman Michael Boskin of President
Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, had attributed the
sluggishness in the fourth quarter in part to the effects of the
fourth coldest December on record, Hurricane Hugo and the San
Francisco Bay-area earthquake.
   Most of the upward revision was attributed to a
better-than-anticipated trade performance. The December trade
deficit was not available when the advance GNP estimate was made.
   The new report said exports climbed at an annual rate of 8.6
percent in the fourth quarter, compared with the advance estimate
of 4.9 percent. Imports grew by 2 percent in the revised report
instead of 7.5 percent first reported.
   Business inventories, meanwhile, were lowered from an initial
48.9 percent increase to a 19.6 percent gain today.
   Other changes included personal consumption, up 0.4 percent
rather than the 0.1 percent decline first reported.
   But business investment declined 6.4 percent in the latest
estimate, compared with a 3 percent decline in the first.
   Despite the improvement in fourth-quarter growth, several jolts
from recent economic indicators have prompted some analysts to
question whether the nation's manufacturing economy will be able to
avoid further deterioration this year and whether it will spread to
other areas.
   ``There is just not any evidence that the manufacturing sector
has any strength,'' said Paul Getman, an economist with Regional
Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``The question is whether
this weakness in manufacturing will spread to other sectors of the
economy.''
   The latest jolt to the current quarter's growth was the Commerce
Department's report on Tuesday that orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods plummeted 10.5 percent last month in their steepest
fall in 32 years of government recordkeeping.
   ``The report signifies an ongoing recession for a chunk of the
U.S. manufacturing sector,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist for
the Boston Co.
   ``The sharp decline is another sign we'll see virtually no real
economic growth in the first quarter,'' added Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers. ``You've
got pockets of recession in sectors such as automobiles surrounded
by an absence of activity in the economy in general.''
   Less than two weeks ago, the Commerce Department reported that
industrial production in January fell 1.2 percent, its largest drop
since falling 1.3 percent four years earlier.
   The economic weakness has prompted the Bush administration and
many economists to urge the Federal Reserve to permit interest
rates to fall further and thus stimulate the economy. The central
bank has kept a tight rein on credit for a year in an attempt to
drive down inflation.
   But the government reported last week that consumer prices rose
a hefty 1.1 percent last month, the largest advance since a 1.4
percent gain 10 years ago, and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
indicated in congressional testimony that the central bank is
unlikely to loosen its grip soon.
   The Fed's tight-money policy is blamed for economic growth
slowing from 3 percent during the third quarter of 1989.
   However, two recent surveys indicate optimism that, while
economic activity will continue to be sluggish this year, the
economy will avoid sliding into a recession.
   Eighty-two percent of the executives questioned in a National
Association of Manufacturers' poll said 1990 will produce slow
growth but no recession.
   And 60.6 percent of the professional forecasters surveyed by the
National Association of Business Economists said they believe the
economy will avoid a recession for the next three years.
   But, the latter survey found, ``the economy is in a danger
zone'' and ``the probability of a recession is not trivial.''

   Mayor Marion Barry pleaded innocent today to
cocaine possession and perjury charges filed after a 14-month
investigation of his ties to a convicted drug dealer.
   At the brief hearing, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson set June 4 for the trial on three felony charges of lying
to a grand jury and five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges.
   Barry, dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and burgundy tie, sat
frowning at the defense table as he read over the indictment. He
then sat expressionless as his attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, entered
the innocent pleas.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said in a statement after the
hearing that his office was proceeding with a related grand jury
investigation into city government corruption.
   Mundy said in a statement outside the courthouse that Barry was
``anticipating the trial and anticipating winning the trial.''
   The lawyer said there would be no plea bargaining and Barry
would not resign from public office. ``There is no reason for him
to resign. In our democratic system, an accused person is
guaranteed the presumption of innocence until proven guilty,'' he
added.
   Barry, who has denied ever using cocaine or other drugs, has
been undergoing treatment at substance abuse centers in Florida and
South Carolina for what aides have said is alcoholism.
   Mundy said the mayor's treatment for alcoholism was ``going
well'' and Barry was in ``good spirits.''
   Barry entered the courthouse through a side door and held up two
fingers in a ``victory'' sign.
   Extraordinary security procedures were in effect. Reporters and
photographers were moved across the street to allow Barry free
access to the courthouse.
   Mundy said he advised Barry's wife, Effi, not to attend the
hearing, and she did not.
   Barry and his wife had difficulty entering the building for a
court appearance on Jan. 19, the day after he was arrested, because
of a crush of reporters and camera crews.
   Several members of the Guardian Angels, an anti-crime-patrol
group, carried signs calling for Barry's resignation outside the
courthouse today. One sign read, ``Do The Right Thing _ Resign.''
   Barry arrived in the nation's capital Tuesday from the Fenwick
Hall hospital outside Charleston, S.C., where he is enrolled in a
substance abuse treatment program.
   The charges stem from an investigation into Barry's ties to a
convicted drug dealer. One possession charge involved the mayor's
Jan. 18 arrest in an FBI sting operation at a downtown Washington
hotel.
   City Corporation Counsel Herbert O. Reid said Barry would return
to Fenwick Hall hospital after his court appearance.
   Mundy refused to comment when he arrived at Barry's office for a
meeting with top city officials late Tuesday. He declined to say
who he was meeting with, but sources said Mundy, City Administrator
Carol B. Thompson and Barry Chief of Staff Maudine Cooper met for
almost an hour.
   None of the three would comment afterward.
   The mayor's arraignment date was postponed from Feb. 21 after
his attorney argued that the first appearance date would interfere
with the Florida substance abuse treatment program in which the
mayor was enrolled. Barry moved to the South Carolina facility last
week.
   The grand jury that indicted him met Tuesday, but handled other
matters and did not review the mayor's case, sources familiar with
the proe said.
   Last week, prosecutors subpoenaed city records relating to eight
close friends of the mayor's, and sources close to the probe say
investigators are trying to learn whether the mayor participated in
any contracting irregularities or whether any of his friends
skirted city contracting law in getting contracts.
   Last month, Stephens said the FBI sting operation that netted
the mayor was part of a ``broad, ongoing probe'' into allegations
of wrongdoing involving both Barry and various city services.
   If convicted of all charges filed against him, the mayor could
face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1.25 million
fine.

<HEAD>Legislators Approve Bill Allowing Peasants to Lease Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature today overwhelmingly
approved a bill that would allow citizens to lease land and
bequeath it to their children for the first time since peasants
were stripped of their farms under Stalin.
   The legislature first voted on each chapter of the 52-article
law separately and then approved the entire law 349-7, with 12
abstentions.
   It is part of a package of measures designed to give force of
law to the economic and social reforms championed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The official Tass news agency called it ``a
major legal document of Soviet economic reform.''
   According to the current Soviet Constitution, all land in the
Soviet Union is the property of the state.
   The government hopes that if this is changed to allow peasants
on collective or state-owned farms to acquire their own plots,
productivity on that land will increase. Productivity on
state-owned and collective farms currently is notoriously low.
   The Congress of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet's parent
body, will be asked to amend the constitution to incorporate the
new law when it meets March 12.
   Today's four-hour session was the third time the Supreme Soviet
considered the Law on Land. During debate on the bill earlier this
month, about 150 proposals and criticisms were made.
   Alexander Nikonov, president of the Soviet Agricultural Academy,
who submitted the bill said about 40 percent of the original draft
had been revised.
   The law states that land is the property of the people living on
a given territory and that every Soviet citizen has the right to a
piece of land.
   Land would be distributed by collective farms or, in the case of
city dwellers or other who wanted to hold land, by local officials.
   The land would not actually be purchased, but leased, and
selling it would be illegal, according to the law. Plots would be
subject to taxes but could be bequeathed to the holder's children.
The state would set land prices.
   Supreme Soviet deputy Pavel Bunich, an economist, said a
nationwide evaluation of the land would have to be carried out
before any distribution could begin.
   He said he was concerned that local governments would make
available only undesirable land.
   The law represents a major step forward in wresting control of
the land from the state. The Bolsheviks socialized land in 1918
which took away holdings from many city dwellers. Peasants were
allowed to keep land until the brutal policy of collectivization
went into effect in the late 1920s.
   Millions of peasants died in labor camps or of famine as a
result of Stalin's collectivization plan, which crippled Soviet
agriculture.
   In action Tuesday, the legislature approved by a wide margin the
creation of a much stronger Soviet presidency, an office Gorbachev
is widely expected to hold.
   Subject to final approval by the Congress of People's Deputies,
the president will be granted powers to veto laws, unilaterally
declare states of emergency, and name the prime minister, according
to a copy of the bill shown to Western reporters.
   Gorbachev, who chaired the legislature's proceedings, emphasized
he has not yet been elected president and said he has even
considered refusing the office, but few expect the 58-year-old
Communist Party chief not to be chosen.
   According to Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the Supreme
Soviet is to meet in closed session on Thursday to discuss the
ethnic conflict between the two Soviet republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan, now in its third year.

<TEXT>
   The federal government and a utilities
group are providing $93 million to Westinghouse Electric Corp. for
a project to develop smaller, simpler nuclear plants by 1999.
   The Energy Department on Tuesday granted Pittsburgh-based
Westinghouse $50 million to develop blueprints that will be
submitted to the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval.
   Electric utilities are chipping in $43 million, said Jack Berga,
a lobbyist with the Electric Power Research Institute in
Washington, D.C.
   While environmentalists and coal producers dispute that the
scaled-down plants will reduce cost and safety concerns about
nuclear power, Westinghouse portrays the project, which it began in
1984, as getting back to basics.
   ``This goes back to our first principles of plant design for the
nuclear Navy. They were simple, designed to be run by sailors,''
said Richard Slember, director of the Westinghouse's energy unit in
Monroeville, 15 miles east of Pittsburgh.
   High costs and construction delays are keeping electric
utilities out of the nuclear power industry, Slember said. The new
plants will cost about $2 billion, one-third less than existing
facilities, he said.
   Westinghouse said its plants will take three years to build.
Construction of existing plants has taken as long as 17 years.
   ``The plants are economic, reliable, long-lived and _ to use a
computer term _ user-friendly,'' said Berga.
   Westinghouse's plans for the new reactors, called AP600s, fall
in line with those of President Bush, an Energy Department official
said.
   ``The president has indicated that nuclear power must play a
critical role in meeting our energy needs. The nuclear option can
restore viability by the end of this decade,'' said David McGoff, a
deputy secretary in the department's nuclear division.
   Not so, said a spokesman for American coal producers.
   ``Nuclear power can't do it by itself,'' National Coal
Association spokesman John Grasser said from Washington, D.C. ``And
I don't see any major rush on the part of utility producers to get
off of fossil fuels. ... Yeah, we believe in nuclear power, but
it's only one piece among a lot of pieces.''
   The Westinghouse plants would employ 200 to 300 people, Slember
said. They would use 60 percent fewer valves and 60 percent less
piping.
   Slember said they also would be safer than current plants,
because ``the AP600 is less susceptible to the kind of errors human
operators make.''
   Judith Johnsrud, director of the Environmental Coalition on
Nuclear Power, a Pennsylvania group based in State College, said,
``The new plants may be termed inherently safe, but the wastes they
generate are inherently unsafe.''
   Federal regulators expect Westinghouse to submit its plant
design sometime this year, spokesman John Kopeck said from NRC
offices in Bethesda, Md. He said licensing of subsequent plants
could be sped up if a standardized design plan is approved.
   The commission approved the last new U.S. nuclear plant in 1978,
Kopeck said. There are 112 nuclear reactors operating in the United
States, he said.
   Westinghouse's new plants would be capable of producing 600
megawatts, or enough power for a city of about 600,000 people. Most
nuclear plants supply from 900 to 1,100 megawatts.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old boy who drank 10 ounces of
bourbon after an adult allegedly prompted him to do so ``like a
man'' died this morning following his removal from life support
systems, authorities said.
   Everman Police Sgt. Mark Bigler said Thomas Griffin died at
Cook-Fort Worth Children's Medical Center at about 8:45 a.m. The
respirator supporting the youngster's breathing was disconnected at
about 10 p.m. Tuesday, but the child had continued to breathe on
his own.
   The hospital was not releasing further detail on the child at
the parent's request.
   Police in suburban Everman said the boy was given the alcohol at
a party Friday night and ``told to drink it like a man.''
   Anthony Jimerson, 21, of Forest Hills was being held in the
Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail after being charged
with injury to a child, officials said. There was no immediate word
on whether the charges would be changed in light of the boy's death.
   The boy was taken to the hospital Saturday afternoon after he
went into convulsions, Everman Police Sgt. Mark Bigler said.
   At one point, the boy's blood-alcohol level was about .55
percent, Bigler said. The minimum level to be considered legally
intoxicated in most states is less than one-fifth that. Doctors
said he would probably have suffered irreversible brain damage, the
officer said.
   At the time the boy drank the liquor, Jimerson was visiting the
Fort Worth-area apartment of Raymond's mother, Patricia Griffin,
31, police said. It was not clear today whether Ms. Griffin knew
that the boy was being given the alcohol, or whether she found out
about the drinking after the boy began having convulsions.

<HEAD>Court Gives Police New Power to Conduct Searches in Private Homes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave police broad new
power to conduct sweeping searches after making arrests in private
homes.
   By a 7-2 vote, the justices said the police may use evidence
seized when they arrested a Maryland man, Jerome Buie, accused of
armed robbery. The ruling reinstated Buie's conviction and 35-year
prison sentence.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said police may
search throughout a house when they have a reasonable suspicion
there is a hidden danger to the arresting officers _ even if the
authorities lack a search warrant and probable cause to believe
there is a danger.
   White said the Constitution ``permits a properly limited
protective sweep in conjunction with an in-home arrest when the
searching officer possesses a reasonable belief based on specific
and articulable facts that the area to be swept harbors an
individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.''
   Prince George's County police investigating the Feb. 3, 1986,
armed robbery of a restaurant obtained arrest warrants for Buie and
Lloyd Allen.
   A half-dozen police officers went to Buie's home in Riverdale
two days after the robbery to arrest him. After entering the home,
they looked for him on the first and second floors.
   One officer went to the basement stairs and yelled for anyone
who might be down there to come out.
   Buie eventually emerged and climbed the basement stairs to be
searched, handcuffed and arrested by the officers.
   At that point, another officer descended the stairs to the
basement where he saw a red running suit, similar to one a victim
of the robbery said was worn by one of the holdup men.
   The suit was introduced as evidence that helped convict Buie.
   The Maryland Court of Appeals, the state's highest, ordered a
new trial for Buie. By a 4-3 vote, the state court said Buie's
rights protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution were
violated because police lacked a search warrant and probable cause
to search the basement.
   Before today, police making arrests generally were allowed to
conduct such protective searches only of the area within a
suspect's reach.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented
today.
   Brennan, writing for both, said the ruling gives police too much
discretion to search ``the special sanctity of a private
residence.''
   ``Police officers searching for potential ambushers might ...
open up closets, lockers, chests, wardrobes and cars, and peer
under beds and behind furniture,'' Brennan said. Even personal
letters and documents could be inspected, he said.
   The case is Maryland vs. Buie, 88-1369.

   More than 100 members of an anti-abortion
group held an Ash Wednesday demonstration today at a Planned
Parenthood clinic and 59 were arrested, police said.
   Police carried away protesters who refused to leave the scene of
the demonstration by the Southeastern Pennsylvania Pro Life
Coalition for Non-violent Direct Action, according to police
Officer Jean Wallace.
   She said the protesters who were arrested would be charged with
disorderly conduct and could face fines up to $200.
   A spokeswoman for the clinic, Frances Sheehan, said the protest
delayed the opening of the clinic by about one hour. She said no
appointments were canceled, but patients with morning appointments
were taken by staff members to other nearby clinics.
   ``It was a very standard Ash Wednesday protest,'' Ms. Sheehan
said.

<HEAD>Newspaper Confirms 1975 Attempted Mutiny on Warship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government newspaper Izvestia confirmed
Western news reports of an attempted mutiny aboard a Soviet naval
ship in 1975 that Tom Clancy used as the basis of his bestseller,
``The Hunt for Red October.''
   The book is about an officer aboard a Soviet nuclear sub on a
secret mission who decides to defect to the West, taking the vessel
with him.
   In the book, which was made into a movie to be released next
month, Soviet naval forces chase the sub and U.S. forces try to
give it safe passage to the United States.
   In Washington, Clancy said today he was contacted by an Izvestia
reporter, who told him the imminent release of the ``Red October''
movie gave the Soviet government an excuse to acknowledge ``the
incident really did take place.''
   On Tuesday, a military prosecutor's office admitted the
anti-submarine ship Storozhevoi tried to escape to Sweden in
November 1975, the news agency Tass quoted Izvestia as saying.
   According to the office, the ship's deputy commanding officer,
Capt. 3rd rank Valery Sablin, led the attempted mutiny, the
newspaper said.
   His plan was to commandeer the Storozhevoi after isolating the
commanding officer and other officers and deceiving the crew into
obeying his orders, Izvestia said.
   The newspaper said Sablin was able to get the ship across the
Soviet border in the Baltic Sea 21 miles toward Swedish territorial
waters. But his plan fell through when the Storozhevoi was
intercepted and returned to base, the newspaper said.
   It was not known whether any crew members supported the mutiny.
   Izvestia quoted the military prosecutor's office as saying
breaking the oath of enlistment, commandeering a naval ship,
removing it from subordination to the naval command and refusing to
obey orders are grave military crimes and betrayals of one's
homeland.
   Sablin was tried by the Supreme Court's military wing, found
guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad, according to
Isvestia. The report did not specify whether the sentence was
carried out.

   The Supreme Court today bolstered the fight
against international drug trafficking and terrorism by giving U.S.
law enforcement agents more power to conduct searches in foreign
countries.
   In another decision, it gave police broad new power to conduct
sweeping searches after making arrests in private homes.
   And in a third ruling, the court upheld Pennsylvania's death
penalty laws, removing a threat to similar laws in 13 other states.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices said U.S. agents did not need a
court warrant to search the home of a suspected Mexican drug
smuggler later convicted in the killing of a federal drug agent.
   The ruling gives U.S. law enforcement officials broad authority
to conduct warrantless searches abroad of non-U.S. citizens.
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on illegal searches does
not apply to non-citizens outside U.S. borders, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   ``Situations threatening to important American interests may
arise halfway around the globe ... (that) require an American
response with armed force,'' Rehnquist said. ``If there are to be
restrictions on searches and seizures which occur incident to such
American action, they must be imposed by the political branches
through diplomatic understanding, treaty or legislation.''
   The dissenters said the ruling may cause disrespect here and
abroad for U.S. laws and constitutional protections.
   ``When we tell the world that we expect all people, wherever
they may be, to abide by our laws, we cannot in the same breath
tell the world that our law enforcement officers need not do the
same,'' said Justice William J. Brennan in a dissent joined by
Justice Thurgood Marshall.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun also dissented.
   In the domestic search case, the justices ruled 7-2 that the
police may use evidence seized when they arrested a Maryland man
accused of armed robbery. The ruling reinstated Jerome Buie's
conviction and 35-year prison sentence.
   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said police may
search throughout a house when they have a reasonable suspicion
there is a hidden danger to the arresting officers _ even if the
authorities lack a search warrant and probable cause to believe
there is a danger.
   In the death penalty case, the justices ruled that
Pennsylvania's laws do not limit improperly the discretion of
sentencing juries and are not impermissibly mandatory.
   The decision removes a threat that existed for similar death
penalty laws in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois,
Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and
Washington.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
states enjoy wide latitude in drawing capital-punishment laws.
   ``The fact that other states have enacted different forms of
death penalty statutes which also satisfy constitutional
requirements casts no doubt on Pennsylvania's choice,'' Rehnquist
said.
   The international search ruling could have a bearing on the
government's prosecution of Manuel Antonio Noriega, the ousted
Panamanian leader who faces drug-trafficking and money-laundering
charges from a 12-count indictment handed down in February 1988.
After U.S. troops invaded Panama in December to capture Noriega, he
surrendered and was brought to the United States to stand trial in
Florida.
   There has been speculation that Noriega's lawyers might argue
U.S. armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion.
   The decision was hailed by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who
said it ``recognizes the right and need of law enforcement officers
to have lawful, practical means of dealing with international drug
trafficking operations.
   ``This decision will clarify and assist our international
cooperative law enforcement efforts, particularly in overseas drug
cases. Drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the
court's opinion,'' Thornburgh said.
   The U.S. military is seeking to become more involved in fighting
drug smuggling by using spy satellites and other surveillance
techniques to track suspects in foreign countries.
   The suspected drug smuggler in today's ruling, Rene Verdugo
Urquidez, was convicted in Caifornia in 1988 of taking part in the
1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala
Avelar.
   Verdugo, identified as a top lieutenant to reputed Mexican drug
kingpin Rafael Caro Quintero, is serving a sentence of 240 years
plus life. He is not eligible for parole for 59 years, when he
would be 96.
   Verdugo's drug conviction and sentence in the killings were not
at issue in the case decided today.
   The search warrant issue arose in a separate, although related,
prosecution.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals suppressed evidence
obtained by the DEA in its search of Verdugo's Mexicali, Mexico,
home in 1988.
   Verdugo was arrested by Mexican police in 1986 and was turned
over to U.S. authorities in California.
   While he was awaiting trial, the DEA got the cooperation of
Mexican authorities to search the home. The agents seized a tally
sheet they said shows the quantities of marijuana smuggled into the
United States by Verdugo.
   A federal judge in California ruled that the evidence is not
admissible because the U.S. agents failed to obtain a warrant in a
U.S. court.
   The 9th Circuit court upheld the judge's decision, saying U.S.
agents are not free to ignore the Fourth Amendment to the
Constitution that protects against unreasonable government searches.
   The Bush administration argued that the DEA agents received
assurances from Mexican government officials that the search was
lawful there without a warrant.
   The DEA said requiring warrants in such cases could hamper its
campaign against drug smugglers. It has offices in 45 nations. In
1988 alone, it said, it helped in investigations that led to 1,200
arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign countries.
   The case is U.S. vs. Verdugo-Urquidez, 88-1353.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   Feb. 27
   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the Nicaraguan election:
   A decade after a bloody revolution deposed an oppressive
dictator and swept a band of Marxists into power, a peaceful
revolution at the ballot box transferred the reins of power from
their hands to the people.
   Nicaragua held surprises this week. Opposition candidate, now
President-elect Violeta (Barrios de) Chamorro, the predicted loser,
proved that the science of precision polling is not even an art in
Nicaragua.
   More surprising is the grace with which President Daniel Ortega
seems to have met his rebuff by the voters.
   Sunday's polling left its mark _ as an anti-fraud measure,
voters' thumbs were marked with indelible green ink. May those
green thumbs indicate that after a long fallow season Nicaraguans
are growing a society that is as free and fair and productive as
Sunday's returns.

   Feb. 27
   St. Louis Post-Dispatch on the Nicaraguan election:
   After almost 10 years of warfare and intense economic hardship,
the people of Nicaragua have voted the Sandinistas out. ...
   The United States is indispensable to Nicaragua's economic
recovery. The first step will be to stop supporting the Contras.
   That should mean that for the first time in years, Nicaraguans
will not have to fear being killed by their countrymen. So far,
30,000 have died in the U.S.-sponsored guerrilla war. ...
   But there must be more. Washington can supply desperately needed
economic aid and end the trade embargo.
   The reasons for (President Daniel) Ortega's defeat are
undoubtedly numerous, but a major one surely is that the people had
been worn down by the tremendous hardship imposed on them by the
Reagan and Bush administrations. They knew that if Sandinista rule
ended, U.S.-sponsored terrorism and economic deprivation would soon
end.
   President Bush has proclaimed ... (Violeta Barrios de)
Chamorro's election as a victory for democracy. It is rather a
victory for oppression _ U.S. oppression. The United States
defeated the Sandinistas at enormous cost to the people of
Nicaragua. The United States, too, paid a high price: It betrayed
its own human and constitutional values as it sought to maintain
hegemony in Latin America.
   Now that the United States is about to have a government in
Managua that it approves of, it has a serious moral obligation to
undo the damage it has inflicted on that hapless country for so
long and to try to restore its own self respect as well.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Feb. 27
   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on the Nicaraguan
election:
   What has often been forgotten should now be remembered: The
principal opponents of the Sandinistas have not been one-time
Somoza henchmen but Nicaraguans devoted to democratic change. ...
   (Violeta Barrios de) Chamorro, whose husband was killed in the
battle against Somoza, is the symbol of her country's long struggle
for freedom _ and, in recent years, its betrayal by the communist
junta.
   Now, with some timely assistance from the United States _
including, we expect, the lifting of economic sanctions _
Nicaraguan democracy has air to breathe, and plenty of room to grow.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle on the Nicaraguan election:
   The spirit of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro must be proud.
   The crusading newspaper editor's equally courageous widow,
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, has won the presidency of Nicaragua in
the first free and democratic elections ever held there.
   She did it against all the odds _ against a government that
could marshal all the resources of a totalitarian state against
her; against the collective wisdom of friend and enemy alike that
said there was no way she could win.
   ``The Nicaraguan people have shown that they want to live in
democracy, in peace and in freedom,'' Mrs. Chamorro said after her
election.
   Whatever difficulties may lie ahead, now at last they'll have
that chance.

   The Janesville (Wis.) Gazette on the airline smoking ban:
   Starting Sunday (Feb. 25), virtually all airline flights in the
United States became smoke-free. Passengers now must wait as long
as six hours for a smoke if they intend to fly the friendly skies.
   It's about time.
   Those of us who recognize the dangers of smoking (both directly
and as inhalers of secondary smoke) should not have to put up with
the smell of cigarettes while traveling in the much-too-close
confines of an airplane.
   This commendable move is just the latest in a positive trend.
   Many workplaces are now completely off-limits to smokers. So are
lots of public buildings. Most restaurants also make accommodations
that allow their diners to enjoy their meals without smelling
someone else's smoke.
   Sure, cigarette smokers should have the right to smoke. That
right, however, should never infringe on the much more important
right of non-smokers to breathe fresh air and avoid the medical
risks posed by secondhand smoke.

<HEAD>Prosecution Witness in Bensonhurst Case Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An important prosecution witness in a racial
killing has been missing since the first of the year, a district
attorney confirmed today.
   Prosecutors will ask a judge to postpone a trial, scheduled to
begin next week, unless witness John Vento is found before then,
Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes said at a news
conference.
   However, if Vento is not found in a month the prosecution will
go ahead without him, Hynes said. He called Vento important but not
a key witness.
   ``We have a trial-ready case,'' Hynes said. ``I'm confident we
have a substantial case.''
   Vento told police he was one of the bat-wielding gang of young
whites who confronted 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins and three other
young blacks in the predominately white Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn, unidentified sources told the Daily News and New York
Newsday, which initially reported Vento's absence today.
   Hynes said prosecutors learned early in January from Vento's
family that he had ``taken off'' during the Christmas holidays. He
said police and federal agents were looking for Vento in upstate
New York and in Ohio, but declined to elaborate.
   Joseph Fama, 18, is accused of firing the shot that killed
Hawkins.
   Vento accused Joseph Serrano, 19, of handing the murder weapon
to Fama, and has connected several other youths to the slaying, the
News reported.
   Unspecified charges against Vento were dropped last year after
he signed an agreement with former Brooklyn District Attorney
Elizabeth Holtzman to testify. The agreement said charges could be
reinstated if he failed to take the stand.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on Reagan-Poindexter:
   ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I
don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't
recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't

recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't
recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ``I don't recall.'' ...
   And so on and so on. In all, former President Ronald Reagan
uttered that phrase at least 124 times while under oath during
eight hours of testimony regarding his involvement in the
Iran-Contra affair _ a scandal that nearly destroyed his presidency.
   The nation's 40th president was testifying as a special defense
witness in the trial of his former national security adviser, John
M. Poindexter.
   Now, to be fair, some of the events he was asked about occurred
years ago.
   Also, it is common for witnesses during depositions who cannot
remember details precisely to claim, ``I don't recall.''
   Finally, we must take into account that Reagan is now 79 years
old and that as president he was involved in thousands of meetings
and millions of documents.
   But he uttered ``I don't recall'' so many times it is certain to
heighten suspicions of those who believe he is lying or trying to
cover up details.
   And mixed in between his memory lapses are denials of wrongdoing
that are in conflict with the claims of Poindexter, who says he had
presidential authorization for everything he did during the
incident.
   Reagan's testimony also did very little to alter the perception
of him as a scripted actor dangerously detached from the presidency
_ an executive who delegated far too much authority, paid far too
little attention to detail and was blind to serious crimes being
committed around him.
   It's a pity that this man, who stepped down from the most
powerful office on Earth a little more than a year ago and who now
commands millions of dollars in speaking fees for his thoughts and
memoirs, is suffering such memory lapses.
   It would be a much greater shame if the American people never
learned the entire truth about this serious constitutional crime
called Iran-Contra.

   Post-Bulletin, Rochester, Minn., on Reagan-Poindexter:
   It is hard to give a charitable interpretation of former
President Ronald Reagan's performance in his testimony in the case
of John Poindexter.
   Poindexter, formerly director of the National Security Council
under Reagan, is facing trial on charges of obstructing
congressional inquiries into the sale of U.S. arms to Iran for
providing support to the Contras in Nicaragua at a time when such
support was banned by Congress.
   Most of the former president's answers consisted of ``I don't
recall.'' He used that reply (about) 100 times in the course of
(his videotaped) deposition.
   It would be easy to excuse the former president on the ground of
his age, except that his performance was consistent with his record
during eight years as president.
   There is no question that Reagan was relaxed and detached as a
chief executive. We are now reaping the results of that sort of
detachment in the savings and loan debacle, the HUD scandals, the
debt crisis, and the trials of his former subordinates.
   When histories of the 20th century are written, Calvin Coolidge
and Warren Harding may seem like astute and farsighted leaders
compared to Ronald Reagan.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on drug-eating bugs:
   The Bush administration is working on a plan to develop
caterpillars who love to chew on coca leaves. If this all works
out, the insects could be scattered through the coca fields of
Latin America, chewing up the raw materials for cocaine.
   Whether our good friends in Latin America would welcome the
prospect of millions of caterpillars dropping from the skies is a
different matter. ...
   Since the drug bug can't solve our problems with narcotics
production, the United States might want to consider a different
approach. We could ship down a couple of thousand of those signs
you see posted outside ... schools, the ones that say ``Drug Free
Zone.''
   That might not have any effect on production, of course. But
what effect has it had on consumption? And it makes as much sense
as a drug-eating caterpillar.

   In the days leading to the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
the managers of the New York-based investment house paid themselves
more than $300 million in bonuses. ...
   The bonuses are big, but their actual sizes aren't as important
as knowing that, unfortunately, they reflect something a bit more
permanent than Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   That ``something'' is the principle that a successful life, to
many people today, is but a succession of transactions whose sole
objective is to get rich and live rich; if, in the course of this
pursuit, people cause a company to fail or fall apart, too bad;
that's Darwin for you. ...
   There's no way to regulate greed out of existence. But we can do
something about it. ...
   We can teach our children that there's such a thing as
over-consumption. We can moderate our immediate needs, and invest
for the long haul. We can return to a time when accumulation of
wealth was merely a vehicle for building the economy, not the
absolute value it has become today.

   Beaumont (Texas) Enterprise on the budget deficit:
   The federal government is playing its hide-the-budget-deficit
game with more than just the Social Security surplus money.
Although Social Security provides the largest surplus by far, more
billions can be found in other fund accounts.
   For example, an airport trust fund financed by a tax on tickets
will have a surplus of $7.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 1990.
The money is supposed to be used to improve frustratingly
overcrowded airports and the dangerously overworked air traffic
control system. But the White House and Congress allow the fund to
accumulate because keeping the surplus on the books makes the
budget deficit seem smaller.
   And to top it off, President Bush's fiscal 1991 budget calls for
increasing the tax on airline tickets to 10 percent from the
current 8 percent.
   It is outrageous to hit airline passengers with a 25 percent
increase in the tax on tickets while the government refuses to
spend the money it has now.

   The Sun Herald, Biloxi, Miss., on U.S. bases in the Philippines:
   In looking at military cutbacks all over the world, the United
States will be looking doubly hard at its six military
installations in the Philippines.
   The U.S. pours about $600 million into that part of the world,
about $500 million of that specifically to the Philippines. ...
   (President Corazon) Aquino's blatant snub of Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney last week, because of proposed reduction in U.S. outlay
to the Philippines, has even the most liberal Americans gritting
their teeth.
   Of course, Aquino may be posturing _ attempting a show of
strength in the face of another coup attempt, attempting to get
more U.S. dollars for her impoverished country, attempting to prove
she is not an American puppet. Even so, the tactic could backfire.
   The killing of an American and his family and anti-American
demonstrations in Manila only add to questions about the wisdom of
continued U.S. presence there.
   The Philippines' strategic geographic position ... (and) the
tremendous investment we already have made in that country make us
reluctant to pull out our 18,000 military personnel and their
dependents. And we shouldn't pull out simply because of a snub.
   But if we are going to make cutbacks around the world, the first
place we should consider packing up is where we are not welcome.

   The Tribune, San Diego, on an earlier California presidential
primary:
   With state lawmakers locked in partisan moves and countermoves,
the proposal to advance the date of California's (June)
presidential primary may get lost in the shuffle.
   That's too bad. An early primary offers California a prime
opportunity to have a say in who governs the nation. ...
   Think back to the 1988 presidential primary. If the California
primary had been held early enough to affect the process, candidate
George Bush would have been forced to face a key issue: offshore
oil drilling.
   Poll after poll shows that California voters vehemently oppose
risking our pristine shores to drill for questionable amounts of
offshore oil. Candidate Bush didn't have to worry. By the time his
campaign rolled west, the Golden State vote was irrelevant. He
could speak vaguely of a commitment to the environment, but make no
solid promises about offshore drilling.
   He's still waffling on the issue.

   A Shanghai court Wednesday convicted five men of
spying for the rival Nationalist government on Taiwan and sentenced
them to prison terms of five years to life.
   They were among more than a dozen mainland Chinese accused of
acting as agents of Taiwan during last year's massive pro-democracy
protests.
   Zhou Yan, 23, and Qiu Lin, 30, were recruited by Taiwan's secret
service while abroad in 1988, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
It did not say why the two men were abroad.
   Zhou allegedly recruited three other men when he returned, and
they all gave Taiwan information about the democracy movement,
Xinhua said.
   Zhou was sentenced to life in prison, Feng to 15 years, and the
others to terms ranging from 13 years to five years.
   Taiwan, an island province off China's east coast, has been
ruled since 1949 by the Nationalists, who fled there after being
defeated by the Communists on the mainland. The Nationalists still
claim to be the rightful rulers of all China.

   Legislators and a women's group
criticized a judge for failing to imprison a Royal Marine commando
who admitted he shot and killed his wife and baby boy for no
apparent reason.
   A jury found Graham Sherman, 21, guilty of culpable homicide in
the shotgun slaying of his wife Michelle, 23, and month-old son,
Josh, as they slept in their home in November.
   But the 74-year-old High Court judge, Lord Dunpark, released
Sherman on Tuesday without giving him a prison term or even
probation saying, ``You have punished yourself more than enough ...
The sooner you try to forget this the better ... You have my deep
sympathy.''
   Legislator David Evans of Britain's ruling Conservative Party
said after the ruling: ``This is a terrible decision.''
   Bill Walker, the Conservative Party spokesman for defense
matters in Scotland, said the judge was ``out of touch with the
real world.''
   There has been growing criticism in recent years of court
decisions in England, where killers have escaped mandatory life
sentences for murder after being convicted on the lesser charge of
manslaughter. This is the rough equivalent of culpable homicide in
Scotland, which has a separate legal system.
   The death penalty has been abandoned for murder throughout
Britain. The penalty for manslaughter and culpable homicide is at
the judge's discretion in both legal systems.
   The Scottish Women's Aid group said in a statement the message
of Dunpark's ruling was that the safety of women and children was
not a priority.
   ``It is a strange message to come from a courtroom that the
crime of homicide can be purged by mental self-punishment,'' said
Brian Wilson, Scottish spokesman for the opposition Labor Party.
   Legislator Andrew Welsh of the Scottish National Party called
for Dunpark to give a detailed explanation. ``The judge may find he
is out of line with public opinion on this,'' he said.
   Dunpark told Sherman the sentence was something ``I don't
anticipate I will ever do ... again. I am going to admonish you on
both charges.''
   The judge said the purpose of sentencing is to punish, and to
deter others.
   ``In my opinion you have punished yourself more than enough by
what you did,'' the judge said. ``You will have to live with this
for the rest of your life. You don't know why you did it. No one
has been able to offer an explanation as to why you did it.''
   There was no deterrent value in a prison sentence, the judge
said, ``for no one in their right mind would have killed without
reason these two people who were dearest to them in the world.
   ``But that's what you did. There's no point in deferring
sentence for good behavior. You have no previous convictions.
Neither is this a case in which in my opinion a probation order
would help you. It would just keep reminding you of what you have
done.
   ``And the sooner you try to forget this the better. For all
these reasons I admonish you on both these charges and you have my
deep sympathy.''
   A letter Sherman wrote to his sister-in-law, but never mailed,
was read in court, saying: ``I don't expect forgiveness, nor do I
expect anyone to understand why. I have gone over it time and time
again in my mind, and I still can't find an answer...
   ``You all know that I love Michelle and Josh with all my heart,
and believe me I still do.''

   Financially troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
announced today it would cut another 2,000 jobs from its payroll.
   The investment firm announced the layoffs in a letter to
employees. Late last year, Shearson said it was eliminating 800
jobs to reduce expenses.
   Shearson President Howard Clark told employees the newest cuts,
which were expected to be completed during the first quarter, were
part of an expense reduction program that would save the company
$400 million a year.
    Clark said the cost-cutting plan and business review is
expected to reduce first-quarter earnings because of one-time costs
associated with the layoffs.
   Shearson's stock reacted positively to the cutbacks, gaining 75
cents to $12.75 around midday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The layoffs would reduce Shearson's current work force to 33,500
from a peak of 47,000. Shearson officials said the layoffs would
occur in all areas at the firm, including the firm's corps of
highly paid investment bankers.
   Today's announcement came two days after Shearson's parent,
American Express Co., said it would inject $750 million into its
subsidiary to shore up its finances, following a $250 million
infusion in December. In return, American Express increased its
ownsership stake in Shearson.
   Shearson has been hard hit by the slump in business on Wall
Street. Profits at many Wall Street firms have been pressured by a
drop in merger activity and securities underwriting and sluggish
stock and bond trading since the October 1987 crash.
   More than 40,000 jobs have been cut from the industry during the
slump.
   Shearson reported 1989 earnings of $110 million, up from $96
million a year earlier, but a third of the profits came from the
sale of a money management unit. Investment banking revenue, which
includes merger advising and securities underwriting, was down 27
percent.
   The company's problems forced Shearson Chairman Peter A. Cohen
to resign in January.
   Many analysts believe Shearson expanded too far too fast during
the 1980s and now is paying the price. Besides laying off workers,
the company has been forced to cut broker commissions and shake up
its senior management in an attempt to turn its balance sheet
around.
   Shearson also is trying to stave off a downgrading of its credit
ratings. Last fall, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it was
considering downgrading Shearson's rating because of the firm's low
capital level, weak profits and exposure to commercial real estate
loans and investments, as well as the overall securities industry
slump.

   Scientists have created a substance that blocks
infection by viruses that cause colds, a possible step toward drugs
for preventing or treating the malady, a study says.
   A drug based on the manmade protein might be able to block or
ease up to 45 percent of colds, said co-author Steven Marlin.
   But he cautioned that the study was done in the test tube, and
that speculating on its meaning for a human cold is ``a huge leap.''
   The research, based on a strategy that shows promise against the
AIDS virus, is presented in Thursday's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   Marlin did the study with colleagues at Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Ridgefield, Conn., and with researchers at
the Center for Blood Research in Boston and the Ernst Boehringer
Institute in Vienna, Austria.
   Their research focused on rhinoviruses, which cause about half
of common colds.
   As a first step toward infecting cells, many rhinoviruses attach
themselves to a structure on the cell surface called the
intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or ICAM-1.
   For the new study, scientists created a special form of ICAM-1.
They hoped it would act as a decoy, so that free-floating viruses
would bind to it rather than their normal target on cell surfaces.
   By this process, researchers found, the manmade ICAM-1 was
largely able to block rhinovirus infection of human cells in the
test tube.
   The result suggests that manmade ICAM-1 or a similar substance
might be able to prevent colds if given before infection, Marlin
said. Scientists would have to do experiments in people to discover
if such a substance would help ease a cold that has already
started, he said in a telephone interview.
   The protein used in the study would have to be given as a nasal
spray, but it may give researchers leads for developing similar
drugs that could be taken orally, he said.
   Since natural ICAM-1 plays a role in the body's disease-fighting
immune system, scientists must determine how the presence of a
manmade version would affect that system, researchers said.
   In an editorial accompanying the paper, two British scientists
cited some other hurdles, such as showing in an animal that the
strategy does any good.
   Such a drug would have to work in concentrations that can be
maintained on the inner lining of the nose, wrote Charles Bangham
and Andrew McMichael of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford.
   Marlin acknowledged that it might be difficult to maintain
effective concentrations over a long period because the nose tends
to expel substances quickly.
   The British scientists also cautioned that the drug might cause
an allergic reaction in the nose. Marlin said that might not be a
serious problem because the manmade ICAM-1 closely mimics its
natural counterpart.
   In research by other scientists, a manmade version of a cellular
structure called CD4 shows promise in blocking infection by the
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The
experimental drug appears to be tolerated without serious side
effects in people.

   Three people were killed in this

elections, authorities said.
   The airport was closed for about three hours during Tuesday's

officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also reported
political unrest Tuesday in Acapulco, where he said at least 30
people were injured.
   In Zihuatanejo, 210 miles southwest of Mexico City, about 200
supporters of the Democratic Revolutionary Party blocked the
airport road. Two protesters and one security policeman were killed
by gunfire when officers removed them, the police official said.
   The police did not say who fired the fatal shots. There was no
word on injuries.
   At least 30 people were injured when police broke up a march by
about 400 people headed for the airport of Acapulco, the officer
said. Police wielding clubs stopped them from blocking the highway
to the airport, he said.
   The protesters were demanding that victories they claim in the
Dec. 3 Guerrero state municipal elections be respected.
   The government news agency Notimex said the protesters came from
numerous towns in Guerrero, where elections either have not been
resolved or the results are disputed by the leftist Democratic
Revolutionary Party.

   President Daniel Ortega ordered a
unilateral halt to all offensive military operations today and said
the U.S.-supported Contra rebels should disband so Nicaragua can
peacefully change governments.
   Late Tuesday, President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro also
told the Honduras-based rebels to lay down their weapons
immediately.
   In a statement issued by his press office, Ortega said the
unilateral halt to military activity was aimed at encouraging the
Contras to demobilize quickly and quietly.
   Ortega also urged the Honduran government to dismantle Contras
base camps near the Nicaraguan border and asked the Bush
administration to end all U.S. aid to them.
   There were indications, meanwhile, that the transfer of power
from Ortega's leftist Sandinistas to Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed
coalition would be troubled, as passions ran strong about what
Nicaragua's future should hold.
   Despite being trounced at the polls Sunday by Mrs. Chamorro's
coalition, the Sandinistas remain the country's largest and most
cohesive political force. They control the military and police and
have the allegiance of a large bureaucracy.
   As transition talks got under way, Sandinista party members
vowed never to let their revolution die.
   The opposition coalition favors a free-market economy, but the
Sandinistas insisted Tuesday that banks and industries stay in the
hands of the state and that land seized by the government remain in
peasant hands.
   ``A change of government does not mean the end of the
revolution,'' Ortega told a cheering crowd of thousands after a
meeting of Sandinista party leaders.
   Rafael Solis, a high-ranking military commander, said the
Sandinistas would not cede control of the police or Central
America's largest army until the Contras disband.
   The top Contra leader, Israel Galeano, said from Tegucigalpa,
Honduras, Tuesday the rebels would not disband until after Mrs.
Chamorro is inaugurated April 25 for a six-year term.
   Officials in Honduras estimate 10,000 rebels and some 42,000
dependents are living in makeshift camps near the Nicaraguan
border. President Rafael Leonardo Callejas of Honduras said that
they must leave as soon as possible.
   Vice President-elect, Virgilio Godoy, early today accused
election officials of delaying the vote count in the National
Assembly races to fiddle with the results and deprive the
opposition of the two-thirds majority required to make
constitutional changes.
   The last time election results were announced _ Monday afternoon
with 82 percent of the vote reported _ the United National
Opposition (UNO) had 55 percent of the vote, to the Sandinistas' 41
percent.
   The pro-government newspaper El Nuevo Diario estimated that
under the proportional system UNO would win 52 seats in the
legislature, short of the necessary two-thirds. It said the
Sandinistas would have 38 and the Social Christians one. The
assembly has at least 90 seats, but any presidential candidate who
gets more than a certain number of votes may also take a seat if
they choose. Only Ortega qualified for an extra seat but has not
said if he will take it.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, a mediator between the two
groups, said UNO was concerned because the Sandinista army is
written into the constitution and the coalition would be several
votes short of a majority needed to amend it.
   Control of military and police forces is considered the most
delicate issue in the negotiations. They are closely identified
with the Sandinista party, and the army is known as the Sandinista
People's Army, not the Nicaraguan army.
   UNO has promised to eliminate the draft and reduce the size of
the armed forces. But the fractious amalgam of 14 parties and an
Indian organization spans the political spectrum from far right to
far left and will need considerable muscle to stand up to the
Sandinistas.
   A statement Tuesday said the Sandinistas, who have ruled alone
since overthrowing President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, would
``defend the integrity and professionalism of the army and the
police forces.''
   The Sandinistas said they still have ``the responsibility to
watch over and guarantee the continuity of the revolutionary
process.''
   In the statement, they said their party would oppose any change
in its agrarian reform and nationalization of banks and demanded
jobs of all public workers be guaranteed.
   Solis, the military commander, said ``if UNO decides to
privatize the banking system it could be an irresponsible act that
starts a war.''
   Privatization is a fundamental part of UNO's economic program.
It hopes to reduce the public sector and return inefficient
state-owned industries to the private sector to halt four-digit
inflation.
   Carter, who held an initial meeting with both sides Tuesday
night, said he was trying to help the parties define the issues and
find a common ground.
   He said before the meeting that Humberto Ortega, and Interior
Minister Tomas Borge, in charge of police forces, had agreed to
give up their posts.
   But it was unknown to what degree the Sandinista rank and file
would go along.
   ``We will give up the government, but not our weapons,'' said
one Sandinista Youth member, Lester Rivera, among 15,000 Sandinista
loyalists at a downtown rally Tuesday.

   Atlantis rocketed into the nighttime
sky after five postponements and carried a spy satellite into orbit
today, riding a dazzling, 700-foot column of fire seen for hundreds
of miles.
   After waiting out clouds and rain, the shuttle lifted off at
2:51 a.m., sending brilliant light and a shock wave across the
darkened seaside space center.
   The craft, carrying a five-man, all-military crew on a secret
mission expected to last four days, disappeared into clouds in just
38 seconds, leaving briefly a glow like a shrouded full moon.
   Two hours later, NASA shut down public commentary about the
classified mission and spokesman Bruce Buckingham said at midday
today that silence meant all was well.
   ``The fact that we haven't heard anything indicates that all is
going to according to plan,'' said Buckingham. ``If something out
of the ordinary takes place, we'll be informed.''
   Observers as far north as Washington, D.C., reported seeing the
light of Atlantis' rockets as the craft followed a route never
before taken by a shuttle.
   NASA administrator Dick Truly congratulated the launch team,
noting, ``it was a tough one to get off, but a great job.''
   No comment was heard from Atlantis' astronauts, and launch
director Bob Sieck said at a news conference, ``the crew was pretty
quiet and very patient.''
   Weather threatened a sixth delay of the mission, and the launch
_ first targeted for last Thursday _ was in doubt until the final
moments.
   NASA halted the countdown for about two hours to wait for clouds
and light rain to move through. The countdown was restarted at nine
minutes, paused briefly for a final weather check, then ticked
smoothly on to lift off.
   As the rocket ignited, light burst from the launch pad and
leaped from cloud to cloud as far as the eye could see. Water
surrounding the pad was gilded with light from the brilliant
cascade of fire powering Atlantis.
   The first two scheduled launches were halted by a combination of
an astronaut's illness and uncertain weather. The third and fifth
tries were blocked by bad weather and the fourth by a failed
computer.
   Because of the payload's classified nature, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration kept secret the flight path,
but the shuttle's orbit brought the ship up roughly parallel to the
East Coast, giving residents a rare, nighttime view of a spacebound
shuttle.
   Theresa Yohn, news producer at WTLV-TV in Jacksonville, Fla.,
watched the shuttle pass overhead for about 25 seconds from a
window at the station, some 150 miles north of the launch site.
   ``It weaved in and out of the clouds,'' said Yohn. ``It was
beautiful, very bright. It had a long tail. It looked like a bright
falling star.''
   The light show was shorter at Tybee Island, Ga., east of
Savannah.
   ``It was almost like another star, a white bright pinpoint of
blue light that continued upwards,'' said Mike Albertson, assistant
city editor of the Savannah Evening Press. ``It only lasted about 7
to 10 seconds. But it beat the hell out of a fireworks show.''
   Atlantis, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity, is carrying a $500 million satellite capable to taking
high-resolution photographs and listening in on electronic
communications from all over the world.
   Its high-inclination orbit is designed to carry it over far
northern parts of the Soviet Union never before observed by a
shuttle-launched satellite, the sources said.
   That trajectory could play a role in monitoring arms agreements
between the two countries. The Soviets have similar satellites over
the United States.
   Because of the secret nature of the mission, NASA blacked out
public release of communications from the spacecraft, and there was
not a word heard from the crew on NASA's public channels during the
launch.
   Atlantis' all-military crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O.
Creighton. The others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot,
and mission specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force
Col. Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.
   Sources said the mission is to last four days, ending with a
landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

   A package bomb exploded today in Madrid's
main post office, injuring two workers, and police said they
defused a letter bomb sent to a government prosecutor at the
national court.
   Earlier this week, two package bombs were sent to private homes,
and a court official was injured in one of the attacks.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
a police spokesman said the Basque separatist group ETA was the
main suspect because it has used package bombs in the past.
   The explosions could delay renewed talks between ETA and the
government, which said Friday it would respond favorably to a
six-month end to Basque terrorist attacks.
   Police, fearing more bombs, ordered the evacuation of the post
office after the explosion, which scattered debris in a first-floor
sorting room.
   Doctors at Gregorio Maranon hospital said sorter Maria del Pilar
Fernandez was in serious condition with burns on her neck and face
and injuries to both eyes. Another unidentified postal worker was
taken to the hospital after the explosion deafened him in one ear,
doctors said.
   Later, police defused a letter bomb discovered by a bodyguard of
prosecutor Eduardo Fungairino, a police official said.
   Fungairino investigated ETA's bloodiest action, a June 1987 car
bombing that killed 21 people in the parking garage of a Barcelona
department store.
   On Tuesday, a package bomb exploded at the Madrid home of
Fernando de Mateo Lage, the president of the national court, which
tries all terrorist cases. Hospital officials today said the judge
lost both hands and damaged his eyes in the blast.
   Also Tuesday, a bomb delivered to a retired army officer in
Valencia exploded without causing injuries.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said ETA was the chief
suspect in the attack on Mateo Lage. In September, ETA gunmen
assassinated anti-terrorist prosecutor Carmen Tagle, who worked at
the same court.
   ``It is obvious that ETA is still mounting attacks against
society and while there are attacks there will be no changes in
anti-terrorist policy,'' Corcuera said.
   The package bomb that injured Mateo Lage was mailed on Friday,
the same day Corcuera said the government would respond favorably
if the Basque group halted attacks for six months.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
since it began its 21-year violent campaign for independence for
the northern, three-province Spanish Basque region.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, claimed responsibility for attacks that killed 17 people
last year. ETA-claimed actions have caused one death so far this
year.

   Heart-conscious eaters who are fed up with low-fat
diets can safely add some olive oil and other monounsaturated fats
to their daily fare, but the extra dose probably won't reduce their
cholesterol, a study concludes.
   A second report has found that getting lots of potassium,
another nutrient with a wholesome image, is no substitute for
taking high blood pressure medicines.
   Scientists have been searching for foods that prevent disease
rather than cause it, and potassium and monounsaturated fats have
been among the possible candidates. Two studies examining these
substances were published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   Some studies have suggested that foods high in monounsaturated
fat, such as olive oil, actually might lower blood cholesterol
levels. However, the new work found that while monounsaturated fats
don't raise cholesterol, they don't seem to lower it significantly.
   Dr. Henry N. Ginsberg and colleagues from Columbia University
randomly assigned 36 healthy young men to eat specially prepared
meals for 10 weeks.
   One group followed the American Heart Association's ``step 1''
diet. In this regimen, they limited their daily fat intake to 30
percent of total calories. Ten percent of the calories wer from
saturated fat, 10 percent from polyunsaturated fat and 10 percent
from monounsaturated fat.
   A second group followed the same diet except that 18 percent of
the daily calories were from monounsaturated fat. The third group
ate a standard American diet, in which 18 percent of calories were
from saturated fat, 10 percent polyunsaturated and 10 percent
monounsaturated.
   When the study was over, blood cholesterol levels had fallen 8
percent in those who followed the heart association diet and 10
percent in those who got extra monounsaturated fat.
   The study did not enroll enough people to make a direct
comparison between the two diets.
   ``I can only conclude indirectly that both of the experimental
diets were about the same,'' Ginsberg said. ``What we hoped to do
here was try to straighten out some misconceptions about `monos'
that have arisen, mostly from the media and food companies, that
they had some independent effect on lowering cholesterol.''
   He said the research suggests that people who give up saturated
fat can safely replace it with monounsaturated fat. But he noted
that increasing consumption of carbohydrates is less fattening.
   ``If you want to have more fat in your diet, you can get away
with it by substituting some monounsaturates for carbohydrates, as
long as you keep your saturated fat consumption low,'' commented
Dr. Scott Grundy of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas.
   Population studies have shown that groups with high levels of
potassium in their diets also tend to have healthy blood pressures.
Several small studies to check potassium's have produced
conflicting results.
   In the latest work, Dr. Richard H. Grimm Jr. and colleagues from
the University of Minnesota studied 287 middle-age men who were
already taking medicine for high blood pressure. Half were put on
potassium, and the rest receive placebos. Then their regular blood
pressure medicines were withdrawn.
   During the next two years, the men continued taking the
supplements _ either potassium or the dummies _ and followed
low-salt diets. About half the people in both groups had to resume
taking blood pressure pills because of rising blood pressure.
   They said their work suggests that ``potassium supplementation
does not reduce the need for anti-hypertensive medication of men on
a low-sodium diet.''
   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Norman M. Kaplan and C.
Venkata S. Ram of Southwestern Medical Center cautioned against
discounting potassium entirely.
   They noted that most of the men in the Minnesota study were
white, and they raised the possibility that extra potassium may
help black patients who are still on high-salt diets.
   They also said they believe people should eat food that is
naturally high in potassium. ``The wisdom of nature, honed by
thousands of years of physiologic adaptations to a naturally high
potassium intake, should not be lightly dismissed,'' they wrote.

   The sister of the longest-held Western hostage in
Lebanon said today as she ended a pilgrimage to Europe and the
Middle East that she believes the atmosphere is right for the
release of all 18 captives.
   ``I think that this is the beginning of the end,'' said Peggy
Say, the sister of Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press.
   ``There was almost, if not 100 percent, agreement among
everybody that I talked to that the timing seems to be right,'' she
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. television interview today.
   ``It might not happen tomorrow, it might not happen next week,
but when it happens, I believe it's going to be all of them, and I
would rather see all the hostages come out next month than see
Terry Anderson come out today alone,'' she said.
   Later, Mrs. Say met the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie,
whose personal envoy, Terry Waite, is among the hostages. Waite
disappeared Jan. 20, 1987 while on a mission to Beirut to try to
free the captives.
   At a news conference after the meeting, Mrs. Say recalled that
she had met Runcie and Waite for the first time before Waite went
to Beirut.
   ``I must admit that I feel some responsibility and was just
devastated when Terry Waite was kidnapped,'' she said. ``I continue
to hope and to pray that when the hostages are released, they all
come out.''
   Mrs. Say was concluding her 2{-week trip with a private dinner
with the families of British hostages and the Scottish relatives of
American hostage Thomas Sutherland.
   She is especially hopeful because she believes that for the
first time since Anderson was seized nearly five years ago, the
three key nations _ the United States, Syria, and Iran _ are
working together to try to free the hostages.
   ``There had to be the U.S., Syria and Iran. It had to be a
cooperative effort and I feel that it is, given that nothing
happens to interfere with it,'' she said in an interview Tuesday
night. ``We've got all the components here. Given that everything
stays on track, I feel it will end, as other people say to me,
sooner rather than later.''
   She praised the U.S. government for its efforts.
   ``I did not have to worry about pressuring my own government to
use its influence in a positive way,'' Mrs. Say told NBC's
``Today'' show. ``Everywhere I went they assured me that that was
being done and that's...quite different from what's happened in the
past.''
   Anderson was kidnapped in west Beirut on March 16, 1985. A
pro-Iranian group called Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, claims
to hold him.
   ``Five years seems to have triggered something in people,'' said
Mrs. Say on Tuesday.
   ``It seems everybody is realizing that these hostages are
becoming a real obstacle ... that they are preventing a move
forward between the United States and other countries, and that
obstacle has to be removed so they can get on to other things,''
she said.
   Mrs. Say said she was encouraged by a commentary last week in
the Tehran Times, which usually reflects the thinking of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, that the hostages should be freed; and by a
statement Sunday from Iran's chief justice, Mohammad Yazdi, that
Islam opposed hostage-taking.
   Mrs. Say was also heartened by an appeal for a new approach to
free the hostages made Friday by Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
the most influential Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon. He is the
spiritual guide to the Iranian-aligned Hezbollah, or Party of God,
which is believed to be an umbrella organization for groups holding
most of the hostages.
   A report Tuesday in al-Hayat, an Arab newspaper published in
London, that contacts in Geneva among the United States, Syria and
Iran were making progress on the hostage issue was one of ``many,
many positive signals,'' she said.
   The White House and State Department on Tuesday denied reports
of secret talks in Geneva.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater did not rule out
that the hostage issue was under discussion, stressing there were
no face-to-face negotiations.
   Mrs. Say said she's ``hoped and prayed for the last few years
that when a hostage release comes, it's part of something larger,
maybe a recementing or a reaffirming of our relationship with
Syria, opening the door for dialogue with Iran, moving toward a
settlement in the region.
   ``If that happened, if these hostages are a part of that, I
don't begrudge the pain and I know Terry Anderson would not. It
would have been worth every day that we've all suffered. I've
prayed that it won't happen for nothing.''

   In advance, Daniel Oretega's triumph at the
polls last Sunday _ the one that didn't come about _ seemed
inevitable.
   Polls conducted by American outfits showed him a landslide
winner. But that didn't take into account the distrust ordinary
Nicaraguans might have had for strangers with clipboards asking
questions.
   The Washington Post-ABC News poll had Ortega leading Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro by 48 percent to 32 percent, with the rest
scattered, undecided or unwilling to declare themselves. A poll
conducted for the Spanish-language television network Univsion had
Ortega winning by an even bigger landslide: 53 percent to 35
percent.
   When Nicaraguans voted Sunday, they turned those polls on their
heads. Mrs. Chamorro won overwhelmingly, 55-41 percent, catching
pollsters, analysts and commentators off guard, surprising her
opponents and herself. The post-mortem search for an explanation
has been under way ever since.
   In advance, Mrs. Chamorro had been portrayed as a loser _
disorganized, offering no articulate solutions to Nicragua's woeful
problems, leading a splintered coalition, slowed down by a knee
injury which put her on crutches.
   It was said that the $1.8 million in aid offered her campaign by
the United States had only stirred resentment among Nicaraguans.
And the Panama invasion was pictured as another impediment.
   Even Secretary of State James L. Baker III seemed to have caught
the Ortega-can't-lose bug. Asked at a congressional hearing last
Thursday about U.S. policy if Ortega won, Baker said, ``We
shouldn't assume this.'' Then he went on to assume it, and laid out
tough terms for Ortega to meet before normal relations could be
restored.
   Many network newscasts left little room for doubt.
   Said NBC's Ed Rabel from Managua on Feb. 21 over a picture of
Ortega, ``This is the man, pollsters say, who will be elected
overwhelmingly this weekend. ... The election observers say the
Bush administration may have itself to blame for Daniel Ortega's
rise in popularity among the votes. The reason, they say, is the
U.S. military invasion in Panama ... It was a close race until the
U.S. invaded.''
   ``Almost certainly,'' said Ted Koppel of ABC two nights later,
``the Sandinistas will still win.''
   In the post-mortems, a single explanation was often offered:
American polling outfits made a fatal mistake in assuming that
Nicaraguans would tell strangers how they would vote.
   ``Many of the people we interviewed in Nicaragua were simply
unwilling to allow themselves to be identified as an enemy of the
Sandinista government,'' says Rob Schroth of Bendixen &amp; Schroth,
which took the Univision poll.
   Howard Schuman, director of the University of Michigan Survey
Research Center and a member of the Commission on Nicaragua
Pre-Election Polls, cautioned when the ABC News-Washington Post
poll came out that difficulties in sampling in rural areas probably
made for a larger-than-normal margin of error.
   In addition, he said this week, ``My guess is that at least one
component (of the polls' failures) is that people did not answer
frankly. The question is how much they trusted that their answers
would be treated confidentially.''
   Added Mark Penn, a pollster who has worked widely in Latin
America but stayed away from Nicaragua, ``Polling is a device that
is useful in a stable democracy, but in a place where there is no
history of democracy it is unreliable.''
   Schroth noted that all the polls weren't wrong. Those by
organizations from Venezuela, Argentina and Costa Rica put Mrs.
Chamorro in the lead. The Washington Post said that of 27 polls
released in 1989 and this year, 14 showed the Sandinistas ahead and
13 gave the lead to Mrs. Camorro's coalition.
   Some analysts say, in retrospect, that those expecting an Ortega
victory overlooked Nicaragua's economic pains.
   And one, pollster Stanley Greenberg of Greenberg-Lake
Associates, says Ortega booted it.
   ``He conducted a glitzy American-style campaign and it
backfired,'' said Greenberg, whose own polls for Hemisphere
Initiative, an observer group, were just as wrong as the other
American polls.
   Ortega put himself in a losing proposition, Greenberg said, by
asking voters to choose between his own austere personality and
Mrs. Chamorro's warmth.
   ``But once the Sandinista campaign centered on the cult of
personality, once the advertising was rock music and the youth
culture, I wonder if the campaign didn't trivalize the issues,''
Greenburg said.
   Laurence Birns, executive director of the Council on Hemispheric
Affairs, a liberal research group critical of U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua, also stressed the economic issue.
   ``No government associated with hyper-inflation is going to win
an election,'' he said. But like others, Birns miscalculated; he
had predicted a narrow Sandinista win.

   Space shuttle Atlantis, aloft at
last on a secret military mission after five launch delays, orbited
the globe Wednesday in a public silence that NASA officials said
meant all was well.
   Atlantis blasted off with five military astronauts and a cargo
believed to be a $500 million spy satellite at 2:51 a.m., its
700-foot column of fire visible for hundreds of miles. It was
NASA's sixth attempt at launching the 100-ton spaceship for the
mission, one short a record for the most shuttle postponements.
   ``Thank goodness we can finally stop meeting like this,'' NASA
administrator Richard Truly told the launch team after Atlantis
rocketed into orbit. ``It was a tough one to get off, but a great
job.''
   Nothing was heard from Atlantis' all-military crew, and launch
director Bob Sieck said, ``the crew was pretty quiet and very
patient.''
   ``The fact that we haven't heard anything indicates that all is
going according to plan,'' added Bruce Buckingham, a spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Because of the classified nature of the Defense Department
mission, NASA quickly blacked out public release of communications
from the shuttle for the entire trip.
   Liftoff, originally set for Feb. 15, almost was delayed a sixth
time because of bad weather at Kennedy Space Center and at
emergency abort sites.
   The first scheduled liftoff was halted when the crew's commander
was stricken with a cold. His illness, combined with uncertain
weather, prompted NASA to scrub the second launch.
   The others were blocked twice by bad weather and once by a
malfunctioning computer.
   With rain and clouds threatening to postpone once more, NASA
halted Wednesday's countdown for about two hours. The clock was
restarted at nine minutes, paused briefly for a final weather
check, then ticked to liftoff.
   ``The weather finally cooperated. We had a good, smooth count,''
said Forrest McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center. ``The
team exercised good patience.''
   As the rocket ignited, light burst from the launch pad and
leaped form cloud to cloud across the nighttime horizon.
   People as far north as Washington, D.C., reported seeing the
blue, white and red light of Atlantis' rockets as the spaceship
streaked up the East Coast on the highest inclination orbit ever
traveled by a shuttle. For many, it resembled a brilliant falling
star.
   ``It only lasted about seven to 10 seconds. But it beat the hell
out of a fireworks show,'' said Mike Albertson, an editor at the
Savannah (Ga.) Evening Press who watched from Tybee Island, Ga.
   Atlantis' 62-degree inclination puts it over far northern parts
of the Soviet Union never before observed by a shuttle-launched
satellite. The spy satellite on board is capable of taking
high-resolution photographs and listening in on electronic
communications from around the world, according to sources who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The mission is expected to last 4{ days and end with a landing
at Edwards Air Force Base in Calif., sources said.
   Atlantis' crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper, the pilot, and mission
specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Navy Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

   Commemorations to mark the 50th anniversary of the
Battle of Britain in World War II opened on Wednesday with a
display of paintings, drawings and sculpture at the Royal Air Force
Museum in Hendon.
   Most members of the Guild of Aviation Artists who produced the
works at the north London museum's request were not born when the
RAF Hurricanes and Spitfires met the German Luftwaffe over southern
England in the summer of 1940.
   The exhibits depict the aircraft and people of the battle on
both sides and cost from $75 for a pencil drawing of a pilot to
$25,000 for a large oil of three Spitfires by Frank Wootton, a
leading aviation artist during the war.
   The museum is the largest in Europe devoted to aviation.
   ``We have planned an extensive program of events for the
anniversary year and in April we will open a major exhibition about
the battle, with British and German aircraft which took part in
it,'' said the director, Michael Fopp.
   Memorial ceremonies to remember those who fought and died will
take place throughout Britain during the summer.

   Labels on meat and poultry products will have
to be more specific when certain flavorings are used, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Federal rules are being changed, effective March 1, to require
``proteinaceous material'' derived from livestock, poultry, eggs,
milk, plants and yeast to be listed on labels by their names.
   In the past, such substances could be listed simply as
``flavorings'' or similar terms.
   For example, a popular ``flavor agent'' or enhancer used for
years in hot dogs will have to be labeled ``milk protein
hydrolyzate.''
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the new rule _ which was
proposed in August 1987 _ was adopted ``to better protect the
public health and serve the consumer's right to know'' what's in
food products.
   ``For many years, the agency has required labels for meat and
poultry products to list all ingredients,'' he said. ``However, an
exception was made to allow `natural flavoring' and similar terms
to designate substances which are often added as flavor enhancers,
emulsifiers, stabilizers, binders, extenders and nutrient sources
in products such as frankfurthers and bologna.''
   Crawford said the exception was allowed because the additives
were primarily flavorings in meat and poultry products and did not
make a significant nutritional contribution.
   But he said the agency's ``paramount concern is public health''
and that it was found some people can have severe allergic
reactions to these substances.
   ``The agency is also concerned about a marked increase in the
use of these ingredients during the last decade,'' Crawford said.
``Some manufacturers may be using the substances inappropriately as
low-cost meat replacements.''
   Now, he said, consumers with allergies to certain substances can
tell if the product contains those ingredients.
   Crawford said meat and poultry processors will be allowed to
make label changes over six months, although the agency is working
closely with the companies to speed it up.
   At least one company is adding a ``stick on'' label to its
regular packaging to further define the product ingredients, he
said.

   A prosecutor today ruled out criminal charges
against the Rev. Bruce Ritter, saying an investigation into
allegations of financial impropriety against the Covenant House
founder had not turned up enough to warrant prosecution.
   Ritter, also a target of allegations of sexual improprieties,
resigned Tuesday night as director of the network of shelters for
runaways he founded in 1968.
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said there were some
``questionable financial transactions'' discovered in the review of
expenditures in behalf of Kevin Kite, a former male prostitute who
claimed he had sex with Ritter in return for material favors. He
declined to be more specific but said the problems uncovered were
insufficient evidence to warrant prosecution.
   Morgenthau also said violations of law may have occurred when
Covenant House supplied Kite with false identification papers in
the name of a dead child. He said he had decided not to bring
charges in that matter either, after consultation with the family
of the dead child.
   A separate investigation by the state attorney general's office
is continuing.
   Since December, four young men who took shelter at Covenant
House have accused Ritter in news reports of having affairs with
them. Prosecutors were studying whether any funds raised by the
charity were misused.
   The district attorney said Covenant House officials had
cooperated in the investigation and nothing was discovered that
cast doubt on the merit of its programs.
   ``Although Covenant House has had to endure a brief period of
adversity, I am confident that it will emerge from this episode a
stronger and more effective organization which continues to deserve
widespread public support,'' Morgenthau said.
   In resigning at a board meeting Tuesday night, Ritter said the
sex misconduct allegations made it ``impossible for me to lead
Covenant House effectively.'' He said he didn't want to jeopardize
the well-being of the thousands of young people Covenant House
serves.
   ``The controversy that has surrounded me for the past three
months has made it impossible for me to lead Covenant House
effectively,'' Ritter said in a statement.
   ``Therefore, after a great deal of thought and prayer, I have
come to the conclusion that in the best interest of Covenant House
and, most especially, for the well-being of thousands of street
kids, I should resign.''
   Former city schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola, who served as
acting president of Covenant House while the allegations were
investigated, also resigned.
   James J. Harnett, executive vice president and chief operating
officer, will replace Ritter until a permanent successor is found.
   ``The focus has got to be on the needs of the kids,'' Harnett
said. ``Covenant House is not one man. It's not me, it's not Father
Ritter. He was not all of Covenant House. But his vision, his
courage and determination remain.''
   Harnett said the controversy has ``been very upsetting to the
kids and the kids are going to be very upset'' by Ritter's decision
to leave.
   The charges against Ritter, 62, arose in December, when the New
York Post quoted Kite as saying he had had an affair with Ritter
last year. Three more men have since said they had affairs with
Ritter.
   Ritter, who is accustomed to laudatory coverage and was once
hailed by President Reagan as a hero, called the accusations
``garbage.''
   The Roman Catholic priest started Covenant House by putting up
runaways in his apartment. It now serves 25,000 youths annually at
17 shelters in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Nearly
all of its $85 million annual budget comes from donations.
   Contributions to Covenant House were said to have fallen off
since the allegations against Ritter surfaced.
   Macchiarola, named acting president Feb. 7, said in a statement
he resigned after Covenant House's board rejected his proposal for
the organization's future. His spokeswoman, Maureen Connelly, said
Macchiarola had wanted to ``conduct reviews, investigations and
audits of current practices and make changes.''
   Harnett said the board ``accepted all of those recommendations''
and plans to hire consultants to revamp procedures. But he said the
board disagreed with Macchiarola on who was best qualified to

   President Bush said he and Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev today engaged in a ``very constructive'' 40-minute
telephone conversation on dramatic recent developments in Nicaragua
and Eastern Europe.
   While declining to give details of the talk, Bush told reporters
flying with him aboard Air Force One to New York that ``it was a
good talk.''
   ``We're going to continue to try to have consultations. We
agreed these kinds of conversations are very useful. I think we
need to do a little more of that kind of thing, and I think he
agrees,'' Bush said.
   The president made the phone call, which had been arranged
Tuesday, shortly before leaving the White House on a four-day
politicking trip that will wind up with a meeting in California
with the prime minister of Japan.
   ``We touched on matters relating to Nicaragua and Central
America, but also matters relating to changes in Europe,'' Bush
said.
   Bush also said he had thanked Gorbachev for the warm reception
the Soviet president had given Secretary of State James A. Baker
III on Baker's trip to Moscow earlier this month.
   The president said he assured Gorbachev that he was committed to
moving ahead on arms control negotiations under a timetable set up
by Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The administration hopes to move forward on three treaties with
the Soviet Union this year: on nuclear strategic weapons, on
conventional arms in Europe and on limiting chemical weapons.
   Both sides have said they hope the strategic weapons treaty can
be ready to be signed by Bush and Gorbachev's summit in June.
   Bush characterized the call as ``a very constructive
conversation.'' He said it was ``forthright, and where we differ we
can spell out the differences without rancor and that's important
in the U.S.-Soviet relationship.''
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported from Moscow that Bush and
Gorbachev ``had a telephone conversation today within the framework
of regular opinion exchange.''
   An official Soviet statement said the two leaders discussed some
pressing international issues, including Nicaragua, problems of
European security including German reunification and preparations
for the upcoming Soviet-U.S. summit.
   Bush, in his talk with reporters aboard Air Force One, did not
identify any differences he might have had with Gorbachev in the
conversation.
   ``It's important that there be some confidentiality if we're
going to be able to speak as frankly as we did today.'' he said.
   ``We touched on a lot of matters,'' he added.
   Bush said he was pleased that the Soviet Union had recognized
the results of Sunday's presidential election in Nicaragua won by
U.S.-backed candidate Violeta Chamorro.
   The Soviet Union played an important behind-the-scenes role in
encouraging Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government to hold an
honest election last Sunday, a senior administration official said
Tuesday.
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, listed
the Soviet role among a number of key elements that led to the free
elections in which Sandinista President Daniel Ortega was ousted.
   Before leaving Washington for his first stop in New York, Bush
also met with Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a Zulu leader from South
Africa who urged him to lift U.S. sanctions against Pretoria as
soon as he legally can.
   On the first stop of his trip today, Bush called for lower taxes
for American business.
   ``Lower taxes are the key to making America competitive in the
global marketplace,'' Bush said at a Staten Island fundraiser for
Republican congressional candidate Susan Molinari.
   ``We can outproduce, outmarket and outsell anybody else _ if we
can keep taxes low for American business,'' Bush said.
   The president said his trip to California would focus on efforts
to fight drugs and crime, and he would see Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu ``to discuss another important issue. It's an issue
of concern to everybody in this country...American competitiveness
in the Pacific Rim.''
   Ms. Molinari, a city council member, is seeking to succeed her
father, Guy Molinari, in a special election March 20 for the seat
he resigned when he was elected borough president. Her opponent is
Democrat Robert Gigante, an attorney who has twice before failed to
win the Staten Island congressional seat.
   Bush heads to San Francisco tonight to raise money for
Republican Sen. Pete Wilson's gubernatorial bid on the first of
four nights in California. Bush ends the week with his talks with
Kaifu in Palm Springs.
   The Kaifu meeting is expected to indirectly aid GOP political
efforts in California by spotlighting trade issues that are of
vital importance to the state, said one GOP operative who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Resentment of Japan centers on trade
competition in key areas such as the auto industry, electronics and
agriculture.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Wednesday proposed a thaw in U.S. relations with New Zealand,
chilled in recent years by disagreements over American nuclear
policy.
   ``I don't think it makes sense to continue a ban on high-level
contacts on matters other than military or intelligence,'' Baker
told the Senate Budget Committee.
   He observed that the two countries share similar positions on
combating drug trafficking and in opposing driftnet fishing in the
Pacific.
   ``It is short-sighted,'' Baker said. ``I am prepared to resume
contacts with my counterpart'' in New Zealand's government.
   The United States in 1986 suspended high-level contacts with New
Zealand and froze New Zealand out of the ANZUS alliance, which also
includes the United States and Australia.
   The move followed New Zealand's denial of docking rights for
U.S. military vessels unless they carried no nuclear weapons. The
United States, in line with its standard policy, refused to confirm
or deny whether such weapons were aboard its ships.
   David Lange, of New Zealand's Labor party, came to power in July
1984 after making a campaign promise to ban nuclear-powered or
nuclear-armed U.S. naval vessels from the country's waters. The
Reagan administration accused the government of undermining the
alliance's nuclear deterrent.

   Drug Enforcement Administration chief John C.
Lawn is resigning after five turbulent years as director of the
lead federal anti-drug agency, and will become an executive with
the New York Yankees, the DEA said today.
   ``There's no suggestion that he's giving up the war on drugs,''
agency spokesman Frank Shults said of Lawn. ``He's very torn. ...
It was an extremely difficult decision for him to make.''
   Lawn has accepted an offer from Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner to become vice president and chief of operations for
the baseball organization, Shults said.
   ``He will handle all matters pertaining to the New York Yankees
except for the players,'' Shults said.
   Lawn and Steinbrenner met in 1987 when they were on a speaking
panel together, and Lawn is a close personal friend of Phil McNiss,
a retired FBI agent who is vice president of Steinbrenner's
American Shipbuilding Co., the spokesman said.
   The DEA chief was a basketball coach when he taught English and
American hisstory at Brooklyn Preparatory School, a Jesuit school,
for seven years before beginning his law enforcement career, Shults
said. Lawn was named high school coach of the year for New York
City in 1964, he said.
   His move to the Yankee organization was reported first by The
Washington Post, Scripps Howard News Service and Newsday.
   Shults said Tuesday that one reason behind the former Marine
Corps officer's decision to retire March 23 after 27 years of
government service is that he will turn 55 in a few months.
   As a presidential appointee, Lawn is exempt from the mandatory
retirement age of 55 imposed on other federal law enforcement
officers. However, ``he would not be able to maintain his position
as a law enforcement officer, just an administrator,'' Shults said.
``It's extremely important to him ... that he is a special agent.
That's his motivation.''
   ``My service as administrator of DEA over the past five years
has been most rewarding and most satisfying,'' Lawn said in a
letter to President Bush.
   ``The ratification of the United Nations Convention, the
National Drug Control Strategy and the Cartagena summit have
established the foundations upon which we can project with
confidence our ultimate success in this battle.''
   Lawn also thanked Bush for his ``personal involvement in
honoring those DEA special agents who have paid the ultimate price
in this battle.''
   In an interview in December, Lawn said the loss of personnel was
the toughest part of his job.
   His tenure began with one of the most traumatic events in the
agency's history: the kidnapping, torture and slaying of DEA agent
Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala
Avelar.
   Lawn's role in badgering Mexican officials to pursue who was
behind the killings was portrayed in a recent television
miniseries, ``Drug Wars: The Camarena Story.''
   Lawn gave no hint in that December interview that he might be
retiring soon, saying he would like to keep his job ``until I
become tired of it.''
   He acknowledged that the job was ``frustrating and challenging.''
   Part of the frustration stemmed from the size of the drug-war
budget. He contrasted the $9.5 billion to be spent in 1990 to the
``excess of $30 billion a year'' the United States spent to wage
the Vietnam war.
   ``To have fewer agents than there are musicians in the United
States Army, or to have fewer agents than there are New York City
Transit Police ... you get a sense of too few people being asked to
face a Herculean challenge,'' Lawn said.
   Last month, Bush requested a $10.6 billion budget for the war on
drugs in 1991, which would boost DEA's share from $616.9 million
this year to $791.3 million next year, enough to add several
hundred agents to the current complement of 3,191.
   When Lawn took over in 1985, the DEA budget was $353.8 million
and there were 2,430 agents.
   ``Jack Lawn has provided extraordinary leadership to the Drug
Enforcement Administration during an extremely challenging time,''
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement.
   ``He has been a catalyst for leadership in the international law
enforcement community, helping to unite the drug-fighting efforts
of many countries. ... His contributions to the international war
on drugs will be missed.''
   Lawn joined the FBI in 1967 and was named DEA acting deputy
administrator in 1982. President Reagan nominated him to the top
DEA job in 1985 to replace Francis M. Mullen, who had retired.

<HEAD>Government Releases 22 Convicted Spies Under Amnesty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government released 22 people
convicted of spying for North Korea under a special amnesty
Wednesday.
   Seoul's main intelligence agency, meanwhile, said two Korean
residents of Japan had been arrested on espionage charges.
   Among those released in the amnesty was So Sung, 44, a former
Korean resident of Japan who was serving a 20-year sentence for
spying for communist North Korea.
   So's case gained international attention after he tried to
commit suicide during a police interrogation in 1971. Some
international human rights groups, including the Washington-based
Asia Watch, had called for his release, saying the charges against
him were exaggerated.
   The government amnesty was announced to mark the anniversary of
the March 1, 1919, Korean uprising against Japanese colonial rule.
   ``I am glad to be released but we must pay attention to
political prisoners not released yet,'' So said after his release
from prison in the central city of Taejon.
   So, who was studying at a Seoul university at the time of his
arrest in 1971, denied passing sensitive military information to
North Korea.
   So attempted suicide by dousing himself with kerosene and
plunging into a burning stove while being interrogated. Doctors
saved his life, but his face was badly deformed by burns.
   So said he tried to kill himself because he could not bear the
torture during his interrogation.
   South Korean authorities said So traveled to North Korea twice
between 1968 and 1970, and was a member of North Korea's Communist
Party.
   He received a life sentence in 1973, which was later commuted to
20 years.
   The Agency for National Security Planning, formerly known as the
Korean Central Intelligence Agency, identified the two arrested
Korean residents of Japan as Suh Soon-taek, 61, and his older
brother Suh Soon-eun, 64.
   The agency did not indicate when the brothers were arrested, but
said they had collected military, economic and political
information for North Korea from the early 1960s until January of
this year.
   If convicted, they could be sentenced to death.
   The brothers set up a Seoul business firm as a cover and had
contacts with many influential politicians and army generals who
served under the late President Park Chung-hee in the 1970s, the
agency said.
   The agency said the younger Suh was recruited by a North Korean
agent in Tokyo, and then persuaded his older brother to spy for
North Korea.

<HEAD>Legislators Approve Bill Allowing Soviets to Lease Land</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators overwhelmingly approved a bill
Wednesday that allows Soviets to acquire land and bequeath it to
their children, a major modification of decades of state control of
land.
   The law, however, stops short of legalizing full private
ownership of property by strictly forbidding the sale of land.
Under the new law, plots only can be leased, and the lease prices
will be set by the state.
   The measure was part of a comprehensive package designed to give
the force of law to the economic and social reforms championed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The official news agency Tass
called it ``a major legal document of Soviet economic reform.''
   The law is to serve as the basis for further legislation by each
republic to regulate land distribution.
   State ownership of land, inscribed in the Soviet Constitution,
has been a cornerstone of communism since the 1917 revolution. But
reformers and economists repeatedly have called for allowing
private ownership as a way of spurring growth in the troubled
economy.
   In a commentary in Wednesday's edition of the newspaper
Komsomolskaya Pravda, economist Pavel Voshchanov welcomed the
reform as a first step to reversing a situation in which the Soviet
Union, with some of the richest farmland on Earth, has become a net
importer of food.
   The Soviet Constitution says ``the land, its minerals, waters
and forests are the exclusive property of the state.'' The Congress
of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet's parent body, will be
asked to change the Constitution when it meets March 12.
   By altering the Constitution and allowing the roughly 23 million
people employed on the 26,000 collective and 23,000 state farms to
acquire plots, the Kremlin leadership hopes to raise farm
productivity, which is notoriously low on those farms.
   Rural families already produce one-fourth of the country's gross
agricultural production, including nearly 30 percent of the meat,
milk and eggs on individual plots they are allowed to exploit.
   In a poll published Wednesday in the newspaper Izvestia, 40
percent of those queried said they were eager to become individual
farmers.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature first voted separately on each
chapter of the 52-article measure, then approved the entire law
349-7 with 12 abstentions. The full Congress of People's Deputies
must now approve it.
   Wednesday's four-hour session was the third time the Supreme
Soviet considered the proposed so-called Law on Land. During
earlier debate, about 150 proposals and criticisms of the bill were
made.
   Alexander Nikonov, the president of the Soviet Agricultural
Academy who submitted the bill, said about 40 percent of the
original draft had been revised to accommodate the proposed changes.
   The law states that land is the property of the people living on
a given territory and that every Soviet citizen has the right to a
piece of land.
   According to the law, land can be distributed by the kolkhoz _ a
state collective farm _ or by the local City Council in the case of
city dwellers or others who desire to hold land. Religious groups
also have the right to acquire land.
   However, land is not actually purchased but leased, and is
subject to taxes. Lease prices will be set by the state and sale of
the plot will be strictly forbidden, the law says.
   The land can be bequeathed to the holder's children. But the
children would not be allowed to divide the plot and the land can
be revoked if the state determines that it has not been utilized in
a ``rational'' way or if the holder seriously pollutes it.
   Under the law, foreigners also are not allowed to purchase land,
as they are in some parts of Eastern Europe. That is bound to
hinder development of joint ventures where the foreign firm is
seeking security for a factory or agricultural enterprise.
   During Wednesday's debate, one Supreme Soviet deputy said the
law did not help move the Soviet Union toward a market economy
since it did not allow for the transfer of land from one citizen to
another.
   But most the debate concerned minor changes in wording.
   Another law regulating private property is still in committee
for revision.
   Daspite the limitations, the law approved Wednesday represents a
major step forward in wresting control of the land from the state.
   The Bolsheviks nationalized all land in 1918, taking away
holdings from many city dwellers. Peasants were allowed to stay on
the land until the late 1920s when Stalin began the brutal policy
of forcing them onto collective farms.
   Millions of peasants died of famine as a result of the
collectivization plan which placed nearly 95 percent of peasant
holdings in state hands by the mid-1930s. Most historians and
economists agree the policy crippled Soviet agriculture.
   On Tuesday, the legislature approved by wide margin the creation
of a vastly stronger Soviet presidency, an office Gorbachev is
widely expected to hold.
   The lawmakers also convened the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies for March 12 to alter the Constitution to create
the new presidency and elect the first holder of that office.
   According to Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, the Supreme
Soviet was scheduled to meet in closed session on Thursday to
discuss the ethnic conflict between the republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan, now in its third year.

   President Vaclav Havel on
Wednesday praised the frankness of his meetings with Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush following visits to
Washington and Moscow.
   Havel also said he would travel to France and Britain on March
19 for talks with French President Francois Mitterrand and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``I always felt Gorbachev was a bit of a dictator the way I saw
him on television shouting at the Congress and making his little
jokes,'' Havel said. ``In reality he is a very modest, shy and nice
man who knows how to listen to you, and you don't see that in
politics very often. I liked him.''
   Havel desribed Bush's ideas as ``extremely interesting'' adding
they had ``unusually many points of agreement'' during their talks
in Washington.
   Comparing the two visits, Havel said that although his U.S. trip
was more hectic, ``the atmosphere was the same, the same mood of
friendly welcome and surprise.''
   Havel said his proposal that the two superpower leaders hold a
summit meeting in Prague this year after they meet in Washington
``was received with great interest by both of them and they made an
impression as if they would like it to take place in Prague.''
   Also on Wednesday, the state CTK news agency reported that a
former top Communist Party official suspected of asking Warsaw Pact
troops to invade in 1968 has been charged with crimes punishable by
up to 10 years in prison.
   Former Politburo member Vasil Bilak, accused of abuse of
political power, was one of the party officials generally thought
to have invited the five Soviet-led armies of the Warsaw Pact into
Czechoslovakia in August 1968 to crush the ``Prague Spring''
reforms. Bilak has denied wrongdoing.
   CTK said the federal prosecutor had asked his Czech counterpart
_ the country is made up of the Czech lands and Slovakia _ to
investigate the case.
   ``Prosecution proceedings on grounds of suspicion of abuse of
power of a public official were already initiated,'' said the news
agency.
   Bilak, 72, is a veteran Communist hard-liner who retired before
the peaceful revolution toppled Milos Jakes last year.
   Bilak was expelled from the party on Dec. 21, and is one of two
former top party officials being prosecuted. The other is Miroslav
Stepan, in custody on identical charges.
   The report did not say whether Bilak also was in custody.

   States may make the death penalty the only
possible punishment for some murderers without violating the
Constitution's ban on mandatory death sentences, the Supreme Court
ruled Wednesday.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court upheld Pennsylvania's death penalty
system despite ``some mandatory aspects.''
   The decision removed a threat to similar laws in 13 other
states: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois,
Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas and
Washington.
   Most states have death penalty laws, but many of them do not
resemble the Pennsylvania scheme.
   Past Supreme Court rulings have struck down state laws making
death the mandatory punishment for specific crimes, such as killing
a police officer, or for specific offenders, such as prison inmates
already serving life sentences when they commit murder.
   Those decisions said the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and
unusual punishment requires that sentencing judges or juries be
allowed to consider aggravating and mitigating factors.
   But Pennsylvania law says, ``The verdict must be a sentence of
death if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravating
circumstance ... and no mitigating circumstance.''
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the law does not make death mandatory despite its
mandatory-sounding language.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   ``Death is not automatically imposed upon conviction for certain
types of murder,'' Rehnquist said. ``It is imposed only after a
determination that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the
mitigating circumstances present in the particular crime committed
by a particular defendant, or that there are no such mitigating
circumstances.''
   He added: ``The constitutionality of a death penalty statute
having some mandatory aspects is not a novel issue for this court.''
   But Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the dissenters, said
the decision lets states bar juries from deciding that one
particular aggravating circumstance is not enough to warrant a
death penalty.
   ``Today, for the first time, the court upholds a statute
containing a mandatory provision that gives the legislature rather
than the jury the ultimate decision whether the death penalty is
appropriate,'' Brennan said.
   He was joined by Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun
and John Paul Stevens.
   The Pennsylvania law was challenged by Scott Wayne Blystone, one
of more than 100 death row inmates awaiting execution in the state.
   Blystone was convicted of the Sept. 13, 1983, murder of
hitchhiker Dalton Smithburger Jr. in Fayette County, Pa.
   Blystone drove to an isolated area, told Smithburger to get out,
robbed him of $13 and fired six shots at point-blank range into his
head.
   The only aggravating circumstance found by the sentencing jury
was that Blystone's murder accompanied a robbery. He did not submit
any evidence to mitigate the crime.
   The case is Blystone vs. Pennsylvania, 88-6222.

   An air conditioning pack had overheated, causing the smoke, said

   ``A passenger took the initiative. We would not have evacuated

   The emergency chute on the DC-8, Chicago-bound Flight 123,
deployed automatically when the rear door was opened shortly before

   About 30 passengers slid down the chute, and the others walked

said.
   One passenger, a woman, later complained of back pains, Hopkins
said.
   United put the passengers on other flights to Chicago, he said.

<HEAD>China Buys 160,000 Metric Tons of Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 160,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said three private exporting
companies made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for June, he said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized China under EEP
on Feb. 8.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 5.9 million bushels. At
current prices, estimated by USDA at around $3.60 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $21 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $6.95 per ton, or
about 19 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Central States Enterprises
Inc., 40,000 tons; Continental Grain Co., 29,700; and Cargill Inc.,

   With the latest sales, China has bought about 5.9 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began

<HEAD>Epilepsy Drug Can Lose Effectiveness If Stored in Humidity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug used to prevent epileptic seizures can
lose a third of its effectiveness if stored in humid conditions,
according to study results released Wednesday by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The results prompted the FDA to renew its advice that drugs be
stored in a cool, dry place.
   The FDA is asking manufacturers of the epilepsy drug,
carbamazepine, to change their packaging of the drug to keep out
moisture. Users of the drug should keep their supplies tightly
closed in a dry location, away from bathrooms, showers and
humidifiers, the agency said.
   The studies may help explain why some patients taking
carbamazepine have complained that the drug's ability to prevent
seizures varies, the FDA said.
   The research, conducted at FDA laboratories in Washington and in
FDA-funded studies at the University of Tennessee College of
Pharmacy in Memphis, found that when carbamazepine tablets were
exposed to humidity, they hardened and then dissolved poorly in
test liquids.
   Blood samples from volunteers who took the drug confirmed that
carbamazepine tablets that dissolved poorly in lab tests also were
absorbed poorly by the body. When the drug is absorbed poorly, it
is less effective.
   The tests did not involve chewable tablets or the drug's liquid
form.
   Carbamazepine is sold under the brand name Tegretol by
Ciba-Geigy Corp. and under more than 15 generic labels.

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Decline 2.2 Percent in January</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Existing home sales declined 2.2 percent in
January as rising mortgage interest rates combined with the usual
winter lull to brake sales to their slowest pace since last summer,
a real estate trade group said Wednesday.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted 3.48 million
units in January, compared to 3.56 million one month earlier. It
was the slowest pace since last August's 3.44 million rate.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors' chief economist, said he did not
see a big increase in existing home sales in the near future, but
added that ``as rates taper off in the spring, we expect sales to
pick up.''
   Surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. show that
fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages rose from 9.83 percent to 10.05
percent during January.
   ``The rate rise in January made a dent, in high-end and
less-expensive markets,'' said Realtors' President Norman D. Flynn,
who also noted that the start of a new year is a slow home-sales
period.
   The housing market has been hurt by the Federal Reserve's high
interest policies designed to stem inflation by slowing the
economy. Existing home sales dropped to a 3.25 million rate last
May when mortgage rates were still near their peak.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to release on Friday its
report on new home sales in January.
   The Realtors' survey found the median price of an existing home
to be $96,200, up 4 percent from December and 7.1 percent from
January 1989. The median means half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   The only increase in resales occurred in the South where 1.40
million units were sold on an annual rate, up 0.7 percent from
December. The median price there was $86,300.
   Sales in the West, where the median price was $144,000, suffered
the biggest decline, down 11.5 percent to 540,000 million units.
   The Northeast posted a 3.4 percent drop to 560,000 units. The
median price there was $147,100.
   The Midwest experienced a decline of 2 percent to 960,000 units.
It had a median price of $74,600.

<HEAD>Report Ceausescu's Brother to Stand Trial in Killings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The brother of Nicolae Ceausescu will
stand trial in the shooting deaths of seven people during
anti-government riots that led to the overthrow of the Communist
dictator, it was reported Wednesday.
   In an interview with the independent daily newspaper Adevarul,
Prosecutor General Gheorghe Robu said Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, a
lieutenant general in the Securitate secret police, would stand
trial for the shooting deaths, which occurred in front of the
former Communist Party headquarters Dec. 21, a day before his
brother was toppled.
   The Securitate officially was disbanded in the days following
the revolution. On the day of the confrontation, Nicolae Andruta
Ceausescu had under his command 1,000 Securitate officers, armed
with 350,000 bullets, Adevarul quoted Robu as saying.
   ``He tried to convince the officers to shoot, but they would
not, even when he threatened them with the execution,'' Robu said.
``Witnesses confirm that he ran around shouting at his men, `Shoot
them, kill these dogs.'''
   The daily quoted one of Ceausescu's men as saying: ``He ran
among us shouting like a wild animal, but no one actually believed
he would shoot these young people. He did this with a cruelty that
I wouldn't have expected.''
   The dictator's son, Nicu, a former Communist Party regional
secretary, and daughter, Zoia-Elena, a former mathematics
researcher, also are awaiting trial on various charges. The
newspaper gave no trial dates.
   News of the pending trials was made public as Romania and its
historic rival, Hungary, agreed to set up an exchange program for
military officers and cadets to try to lessen tensions.
   In a communique, the nations also agreed to create a commission
``to resolve historical disputes between the two countries.''
   The neighbors have been at odds for centuries over Transylvania,
now part of Romania but ruled for centuries by Hungary. Tensions in
recent years have focused on mistreatment of Romania's Hungarian
minority under Ceausescu, and disagreements have resurfaced after
the revolution.
   The accords followed a visit by Hungarian Defense Minister
Ferenc Karpati, who met his Romanian counterpart Victor Anastase
Stanculescu and Premier Petre Roman on improving bilateral
relations.
   In a news conference at the Hungarian Embassy, Stanculescu
thanked Hungary for ``being the first country to ... offer (its)
help to the Romanian army, which supported the revolution.''
   Also Wednesday, the official Rompres news agency published a
Defense Ministry breakdown on the makeup of the Securitate.
   The ministry said the new security organization being set up
would not be used for repression or intimidation.
   The composition and fate of the Securitate has been a major
question since the uprising, with the belief that it continues to
exist. Publication of the Defense Ministry statistics appeared to
be an attempt to dispel those fears.
   ``The newly created bodies will not carry out repressive actions
in any situation,'' the statement said.
   The statement, issued in the name of Stanculescu, asserted that
the new agency, which he has likened to the FBI in the United
States, would not ``listen to or watch people in order to
intimidate them or to satisfy the interests of certain parties or
political formations.''
   More than 3,575 security personnel have been suspended and
others are being investigated, the Defense Ministry said. About
15,000 officers worked full-time for Securitate, and tens of
thousands of informers also were on the payroll.

<HEAD>1989 Economic Growth Slowest in More Than 3 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at its slowest pace in
more than three years in 1989, the government said Wednesday.
Analysts welcomed a slight upward revision in fourth-quarter
activity, but many remain anxious over prospects this year.
   The Commerce Department revised the fourth quarter gross
national product upwards from 0.5 percent to 0.9 percent, which in
turn boosted overall 1989 economic growth to 3.0 percent from last
month's 2.9 percent.
   Despite the improvement, it was the slowest yearly growth since
a 2.7 percent gain in 1986 and the lowest quarterly advance since
the economy grew 0.8 percent in the third quarter of that year. The
GNP rose 4.4 in 1988.
   ``The bottom line is, the economy is likely to stay out of a
recession, but just barely,'' said David Jones, an economist with
Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a New York government securities dealer.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the report offered
further evidence that the downward slide of the economy had come to
an end although the threat of a recession still existed.
   ``Whenever you have economic growth as low as this, you are
vulnerable,'' he told members of the House Budget Committee. But he
said that the greatest danger point for a recession had passed in
the fall and early winter and that chances for a downturn were now
lower.
   Greenspan said the Federal Reserve's economic forecast that the
GNP would grow at a modest annual rate of 1.75 percent to 2 percent
this year was an expectation of a ``modest quickening pace,
somewhat later in the year, but a very modest quickening.''
   The Bush administration is forecasting 2.6 percent growth this
year. The revised 3.0 percent rise in the GNP exceeded its 2.9
percent projection for 1989.
   Comparing the economy at present to a tire with a slow leak,
Greenspan said, ``As best we can judge, the leak has stopped. The
system is no longer eroding. It has stabilized. It has not yet,
however, started to exhibit any significant reversal.''
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist for Fuji Securities
Inc., in Chicago, also said the danger of recession is minimal. But
he contended ``the outlook over the next two quarters is more of
the same _ that is, more positive growth, but really sluggish
growth of 1 percent or thereabouts.''
   The GNP represents the total U.S. output of goods and services
and is the broadest measure of the nation's economic health.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP was revised downward from a
3.8 percent annual rate to 3.6 percent, but that was not enough to
change the 4.5 percent rate for the year. It was the fastest
increase since a 6.2 percent jump in 1982.
   The Commerce Department said an improvement in the trade deficit
was the major contributor to the fourth-quarter GNP revision.
December's imbalance, the lowest monthy deficit in five years, was
not available when the department made its initial GNP estimate in
January.
   As a result of the new information, exports were revised upwards
from 4.9 percent to 8.6 percent, while imports were lowered from
7.5 percent to 2 percent.
   That and an increase in personal consumption spending were
enough to offset downward revisions in business inventories and
business investment spending.
   While the decline in inventories was a negative factor for the
GNP, it was good news for the economy as a whole. If inventories
were to pile up excessively, it could mean cutbacks in production
and a loss of jobs.
   ``The fact that business was able to keep inventories lean and
mean has essentially reduced the downside risk in the economy,''
Jones said.

<HEAD>Cambodian Talks End Without Progress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days of informal Cambodian peace
talks ended Thursday with delegates still deadlocked on how to run
the country until a new government can be elected, the co-host of
the negotiations said.
   No major breakthroughs had been expected. Talks at a higher
level are planned this month in Paris.
   The Jakarta meeting focused on an Australian proposal to have
the United Nations run Cambodia until elections, and to deploy an
international peacekeeping force to ensure security.
   The five permanent U.N. Security Council members _ Britain,
China, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States _ support
the Australian plan. It was proposed after formal peace talks in
Paris broke down last summer largely over the question of how the
Cambodian factions would share power before elections.
   The Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodia, and the
three-party guerrilla coalition fighting it, appear to agree on
U.N. supervision of elections, but they differ on who should be in
charge of Cambodia until the vote.
   Premier Hun Sen contends that dismantling the present
administration could enable the Communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas to
seize power.
   Khmer Rouge spokesmen have expressed reservations over the
Australian plan but have not announced a full policy decision.
   Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Son Sann, leaders of the two
non-Communist guerrilla groups, have welcomed the Australian
proposal.
   Prime Minister Ali Atlatas of Indonesia said the talks ended
early Thursday with delegates unable to reach agreement. He said no
document was issued.
   In addition to the four Cambodian factions, the talks included
delegates from France, Laos, the United Nations and the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations _ Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.
   Millions have been killed in Cambodia since 1970, when a coup
ended three decades of rule by Sihanouk. The Khmer Rouge took power
in 1975 after a civil war and then killed hundreds of thousands of
people in trying to create a new agrarian society.
   Vietnam invaded in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge but never
was able to completely stamp out the guerrilla resistance, which
holds Cambodia's seat in the U.N. General Assembly. Vietnam said it
withdrew the last of its troops from Cambodia last fall, but there
have been allegations that some soldiers and advisers have returned
to help support government troops.
   Under the Australian plan, the U.N. seat would be declared
vacant until a new government was formed after elections.
   Australia's foreign minister, Gareth Evans, also proposed a
supreme national council with delegates from each of the four
factions to hold the country's sovereignty during the transition.

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez had an exceptionally
small crew on the voyage which ended in disaster, a possible cause
of stress and problems, a veteran tanker captain testified today.
   Robert Beevers, undergoing cross-examination by the defense,
said the ships he sailed on often had a crew of 32 people, but by
the time he quit in 1987, companies were scaling it down because of
economics.
   The Exxon Valdez, he said, had 19 crew members. ``That was
certainly the smallest crew on a tanker that I've seen.''
   Asked how the crew configuration affected the ship's journey,
Beevers said, that with a short crew ``there's more stress. There's
more problems.''
   The prosecution witness was questioned in depth about testimony
he gave Tuesday against Joseph Hazelwood. His answers under
questioning by Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson were more conciliatory
than they had been under prosecution inquiry.
   But he continued to maintain that Hazelwood erred when he left
the ship's bridge during a tricky maneuver. On Tuesday, he had
called Hazelwood reckless and guilty of bad judgment and said his
actions risked his ship and his crew.
   ``The master should be on the bridge,'' he said.
``Traditionally, that is his duty.''
   Jurors in the Hazelwood trial were warned to avoid news reports
while defense lawyers worried that word of a federal indictment of
Exxon Corp. might prejudice the skipper's trial.
   Hazelwood lawyer Michael Chalos criticized the timing of
Tuesday's indictment of Exxon and its subsidiary, Exxon Shipping
Co., on two felony charges and three misdemeanors stemming from the
nation's largest oil spill.
   ``I'm wondering if there isn't a bigger political force at work
here. They've waited 11 months. Why, as we're finishing the trial,
are they putting out press releases and an indictment?'' Chalos
said. ``There's a lot more here than meets the eye.''
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone warned jurors that if they
could not avoid news reports he had the power to sequester them in
a hotel, although he added that step wasn't necessary yet.
   ``Any information concerning the oil spill is off limits,''
Johnstone said.
   The defense indicated no plans to seek a mistrial. Chalos said,
``A mistrial at this point would only help the state because we
feel it's going very well for captain Hazelwood.''
   Until now, Hazelwood, 43, had been the only defendant charged
criminally in the tanker grounding. He is charged with a felony,
criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors: reckless endangerment,
operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of
oil. If convicted, he could get 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   The 987-foot Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of
Alaska crude oil into the clear waters of Prince William Sound on
March 24, killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife and
tarring beaches for hundreds of miles.
   The Exxon indictment accuses the company of employing crew
members ``knowing such persons to be physically and mentally
incapable of performing the duties assigned to them.''
   It mentions that the skipper left the ship's bridge in the hands
of an uncertified third mate and ``a helmsman who was known by
Exxon Shipping Company to be incompetent at performing his assigned
duties.''
   The latter was a reference to Robert Kagan, the helmsman who has
been blamed by witnesses for failing to steer the ship properly. He
remains an employee of Exxon. Hazelwood was fired shortly after the
accident.
   Of Hazelwood, witness Beevers said, ``He created the risk of
grounding, of losing the vessel, of fire, explosion and death to
his crew and of pollution that occurred.''
   He accused Hazelwood of trying to drive his stranded ship off a
jagged reef in Prince William Sound without taking necessary tests
to determine its stability. He said Hazelwood risked sinking or
capsizing the ship.
   ``I feel that he used very poor judgment in his actions
basically from the time they grounded to well after the engines
were stopped,'' Beevers said.
   Beevers said he is being paid $35,000 for his services in
helping prosecutors prepare their case against Hazelwood. He worked
14 years as a tanker captain and retired from the merchant marine
in 1987.
   Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson asked, ``Mr. Beevers, you're not
perfect, are you?''
   ``No, I'm not,'' said Beevers, who acknowledged he sometimes had
used bad judgment.
   ``And have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised bad
judgment?'' asked Madson.
   ``No,'' said the witness.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole said he would rest his
case by week's end.

   Underwater explorer Robert Ballard will guide
more than 250,000 children through a high-tech tour of two
shipwrecks from the War of 1812 in a science project sponsored by
the Jason Foundation for Education.
   About 40 children will accompany Ballard to Lake Ontario to
examine the remains of the Hamilton and Scourge, which Ballard
called ``incredible archeological treasures.'' More than a
quarter-million more students will view the expedition on screens
via satellite links in schools and museums across the United States
and Canada.
   The Jason Foundation, named for a robotic device used in the
explorations, last year went to the Mediterranean Sea to look at an
underground volcano and the deepest known ancient shipwreck site.
   Cameras will take the children on close-up tours of the lake and
sunken ships. They will be able to ask questions of Ballard during
the presentations and may also be permitted to operate the robot
through the satellite link, Ballard said.
   Ballard, senior scientist for the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts, discovered the Titanic in 1985 and
the German battleship Bismarck last year. He founded the Jason
Foundation for Education, a joint venture of educators, scientists,
museums and private industry, to encourage scientific careers among
American children.
   Ballard said there are no American graduate students at Woods
Hole, which is affiliated with MIT, and 60 percent of applicants
for the coming year are foreign. ``We are hopelessly behind France,
Germany, England and Japan,'' Ballard said. He said the problem
begins in grades 4-12 and results in widespread scientific
illiteracy.
   The Jason project will train more than 4,000 teachers in a
curriculum developed specifically for the Lake Ontario expedition.
Their pupils will be well-grounded in engineering, robotics, marine
biology, archeology, maritime history and other relevant areas by
the time Ballard and his crew begin broadcasting live from the lake
bottom on April 30.
   The next Jason project will take students to the Galapagos
Islands off the coast of Ecuador, Ballard said. The foundation may
also do a joint project in the South Pacific with Japan on the 50th
anniversary of Pearl Harbor in 1991, and may work with the
government of Spain on a 500th-anniversary commemoration of
Columbus' 1492 voyage to America.

   There's no lake and Los Angeles
is 100 miles away, so residents are voting to determine what's in a
name.
   The Chamber of Commerce is sending out ballots to homes and
businesses in Lake Los Angeles, giving the 15,000 residents a
chance to rename their town, said chamber president Mary Jarvis.
   Richard Blalock, the owner of Mr. B's restaurant, already has
his mind made up: ``The name to me is meaningless.''
   One commonly mentioned alternative name is Twin Cities, which
refers to the town's split identity between Lancaster, 25 miles to
the north, and Palmdale, 12 miles south, Ms. Jarvis said.
   Postal delivery zones triggered the possible name-dropping in
this unincorporated community northeast of Los Angeles.
   Residents serviced by the Lancaster Post Office must drive a
half-hour to pick up parcels, and the rest take the southern road
to the Palmdale Post Office.
   But to get their own ZIP code, residents must vote to
incorporate their community. Hence the search for the right name.
   The Antelope Valley community originally featured a man-made
lake that was too costly to maintain. Now, a baseball diamond sits
on the dry lake bed.
   ``People say, `We have no lake. We are not part of Los Angeles,
so we should not be called Lake Los Angeles,'' Ms. Jarvis said.
   ``But it's been pointed out that there are not any antelope in
the Antelope Valley, either. So what's in a name?''

   An elementary school principal and her

delighted but the head custodian wasn't too pleased.
   ``They called for blankets, legal pads, and their hats kept
blowing off and I had to take them back up,'' custodian Elizabeth
Sheffield said of Monday's stunt.
   ``Next year, I think I'll ask them to put me on the roof.''
   Principal Janet Wynne agreed to spend the day on the roof if the
350 pupils at Jackie Carden Elementary School read 2,000 books in
six weeks. They finished in two weeks.
   Her assistant, Marsha Miholovich, then agreed to join her on the
roof if the students read another 2,000 books. The children
surpassed their goal by 75 books within another two weeks.
   The two administrators passed the time sunbathing, listening to
the radio, snacking, and reading books of their own.

<TEXT>
   Got a buck and a dream of small-town living?
This rural community has a deal for you.
   To attract residents, Minto is offering three dozen building
lots for $1 apiece.
   ``The idea is to try and entice some people into Minto, somebody
who is thinking about building in the area,'' said councilman Tony
Osowski, who conceived the homesteading plan.
   Most of the lots are in a 38-acre subdivision that remained
unfinished when a developer went bankrupt. Walsh County seized the
unsold property to make up for non-payment of taxes, and sold it to
the town for $1 a lot two years ago, said Auditor Leo Misialek.
   Buyers will be entitled to a two-year real estate tax exemption
on new single-family homes up to $75,000 in value, and they won't
have to pay special assessments for a recently built water and
sewer system.
   But they must pay legal fees to buy the lots and a fee to
connect with the town's water supply. The street needs
blacktopping, and new residents likely would have to pay for that,
too.
   The town of 700 residents is economically stable, relying
heavily on agriculture, and is 30 miles north of Grand Forks, nine
miles south of Grafton and about 20 miles from the Grand Forks Air
Force Base, Misialek said.
   ``We're not losing in Minto, but we're not gaining,'' he said.
``We're just spinning our wheels.''

<HEAD>Poindexter Urges Judge to Order Reagan to Turn Over Diaries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan's diaries accurately
document important events in the Iran-Contra affair that Reagan now
says he has forgotten, John Poindexter said in court papers
Wednesday.
   Lawyers for the former national security adviser said U.S.
District Court Judge Harold Greene should order Reagan to turn over
36 diary excerpts for the former adviser's Iran-Contra trial, which
is scheduled to start Monday.
   Greene directed Reagan on Jan. 30 to supply Poindexter with the
excerpts, but the former president invoked executive privilege to
avoid turning them over. The Bush administration later joined
Reagan in invoking executive privilege and Greene now plans to rule
on the matter.
   In testimony videotaped Feb. 16-17 for Poindexter's trial,
Reagan ``repeatedly professed an inability to recall certain key
events,'' Poindexter's lawyers said, but Poindexter believes these
events are ``accurately documented in his diaries.''
   Poindexter's court filing characterized as ``patently
frivolous'' the Justice Department's assertion that ``almost all
information in the diary entries is already in the public domain.''
   The Justice Department's position ``overlooks that Mr. Reagan is
the one who caused this information to enter the public domain and
it is he who determined that the public interest demanded such
disclosures,'' said Poindexter.
   Reagan is now trying to claim that ``the public interest, all of
a sudden, favors non-disclosure when a criminal defendant's right
to liberty is at stake,'' said Poindexter's lawyers.
   The defense filing said the excerpts touch on Reagan's knowledge
of Poindexter's activities on behalf of the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua and on Reagan's knowledge of Israeli arms shipments to
Iran in late 1985. It said the excerpts also address Reagan's
knowledge that proceeds were generated from U.S. arms sales to Iran.
   Greene, who has seen the diary excerpts, said one entry reports
on Poindexter's ``successful'' trip to Central America in December
1985 and contains a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably indicating
Reagan knew of Poindexter's activities on behalf of the Contras.
   In his videotaped deposition, Reagan testified he was unable to
recall what Poindexter reported to him about the Central American
trip.
   Another diary entry, according to Greene, deals with Reagan's
meetings with officials including Poindexter in December 1985 on
the sales of arms to Iran.
   The former president testified that he doesn't recall a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran.
   A third diary excerpt briefly addresses the issue of the
proceeds from arms sales to Iran, the judge said.
   Reagan testified that he was unaware of the diversion of Iran
arms sale proceeds to the Contras and that he was aware only that
the U.S. government had received $12.2 million covering the cost of
weapons sold to Iran.
   He said that had he known about additional money, he ``would
have given it back.''

   The United States has rushed arms to the UNITA
rebels under siege by Soviet-backed government forces in Angola,
Angolan representatives said Wednesday after meeting with U.S.
defense officials.
   It was believed to be the first meeting at the Pentagon with
officials from Angola, which does not have diplomatic relations
with the United States. Gen. Roberto Leal Monteiro, an adviser to
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and Justice Minister Fernando
Franca Van Dunem, met with Defense Department officials, the
Angolans said.
   A Pentagon official confirmed that a meeting had taken place
with Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Jim Woods. The official,
who asked not to be named, described the session as establishing a
basis for future talks.
   ``It was a get acquainted meeting, very friendly and
non-threatening,'' she said.
   The Angolans said the talks centered on the escalating fighting
in Angola, the most bitter in the country's 15-year civil war.
   The Angolans said they urged the United States to stop arming
UNITA so that peace talks, stalled since the summer, could resume.
   Angolan forces attacked UNITA to punish the rebels for acts of
sabotage and to prove that the Angolan military could subdue UNITA
without Cuba's help, said Van Dunem. Under a U.S.-mediated
agreement, more than 30,000 Cuban troops have left Angola and an
additional 20,000 are to leave by mid-1991.
   The Angolan government submitted a peace proposal, including an
immediate cease-fire, on Feb. 6 but has yet to receive an answer
from Mobutu Sese Seko, the president of Zaire and a mediator in
talks between the Angolan government and UNITA, Van Dunem said.
   U.S. officials say they have not been able to find out whether
Mobutu received the proposal. In any case, Angola is unwilling to
have direct talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi, while the United
States believes that should be the next move, said one U.S.
official who asked not to be named.
   ``We are more interested in a peaceful than a military
solution,'' said Van Dunem.
   Gen. Monteiro said two ships loaded with weapons for UNITA had
arrived since Feb. 2 at the port of Matadi in northern Zaire. The
arms were then flown to a U.S.-built airfield in UNITA territory in
southeastern Zaire, he said.
   The Angolan army also has intelligence information that five to
eight U.S. military advisers are helping UNITA at the guerrilas'
headquarters in the town of Jamba.
   The Pentagon official who requested anonymity declined to
comment on the specific claims made by the Angolans regarding U.S.
aid to UNITA.
   Van Dunem said Angola's air force bombed a military command post
in Jamba last Saturday, but he denied UNITA's claims that chemical
weapons had been used.
   Official figures on the extent of U.S aid for UNITA are secret.
Estimates range from $40 million to $80 million and are said to
include Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. The Soviets are believed to
have provided $600 million to $800 million in aid over the course
of the war.
   Gen. Monteiro said government forces captured U.S.-made TOW
anti-tank missiles in the town of Mavinga, which he said fell in
bloody fighting earlier this month. Government troops also found
U.S.-made Claymore anti-personnel mines and 81mm mortars, Van Dunem
said.
   UNITA blew up the airstrip at Mavinga to prevent it from falling
into enemy hands, he said. Fighting around Mavinga continues in
what he described as clean-up operations.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said fighting continues around Mavinga, but it's ``not clear if
either controls the entire'' town. The official could not confirm
that Jamba had been bombed.
   UNITA has denied Jamba was bombed but said the government
conducted intensive bombings on other parts of UNITA territory.
   Asked whether government forces would advance on Jamba, Van
Dunem said, ``we have no intention to have a military victory''
over UNITA. But if the guerrillas continue to wage sabotage the
army will retaliate, he said.
   The United States doesn't have formal diplomatic relations with
Angola, but has had informal discussions with the government for
several years in efforts to resolve Southern African issues.
   The current talks are an extention of that effort, and are aimed
at supporting Mobutu's attempt to negotiate a peace settlement.

   A 102-pound Rottweiler that soothed a
5-year-old epileptic girl during the October earthquake has been
named Dog Hero of the Year by a dog-food company.
   Reona the Rottweiler leapt over three fences into a neighbor's
garden when the temblor struck, sauntered through the back door and
sat next to Vivian Cooper. The frightened girl, who is susceptible
to seizures when excited, quickly calmed down, said her mother,
Karen.
   Dog-food maker Ken-L Ration honored the dog, throwing in lavish
supplies of food.
   Mrs. Cooper suffered leg cuts and a broken foot when she was hit
by jars shaken out of a refrigerator by the Oct. 17 quake.
   ``I got to the door once, and the earthquake moved me back,''
she said Tuesday. ``That's when I thought we were going to die.
   ``I looked out the back, and there was this big brown face.
Reona looked at me as if to say, `What's the matter with you?' She
walked over to my daughter, sat on her feet, and held her against
the wall.''
   ``When I finally got over to Reona, I said, `Can I have my baby,
please?''' Mrs. Cooper said. ``And Reona looked at me like, `Well,
if you're calm enough.' Then she walked out the door.''

   The Congress Party of former Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi suffered heavy losses in elections for eight
state legislatures, according to early returns Wednesday.
   Initial results from Tuesday's voting, which also was marked by
violence in which scores of people were killed, indicated strong
gains for the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party, and for
the Janata Dal, led by Prime Minister V.P. Singh who took office
after the Congress Party suffered heavy losses in November's
parliamentary elections.
   Voters cast ballots in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh,
Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and Rajasthan
states. Elections were also held in Pondicherry, a federally
administered territory in the south, and in five national
parliamentary constituencies. Balloting was held in 17 other state
assembly consituencies where elections were either countermanded or
byelections were due.
   The Congress Party had controlled all eight state legislatures.
   Initial results showed the Congress Party won only 49 of the 233
races decided, the Press Trust reported. The Janata Dal won 61 and
the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party won 116. The remaining seats
were shared among the Communists, regional parties and independents.
   Final results were expected by Friday.
   From the western deserts to the foothills and mountains of the
northern Himalayas, about 150 million of the 213 million registered
voters on Tuesday chose among candidates for 1,580 seats.
   The Congress Party fielded candidates in all but 30 of the 1,610
constituencies, while the Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party
put up about 1,000 candidates each.
   In all, about 21,200 candidates contested, but more than half
were independents.
   At least 94 people died and 250 were injured in violence related
to the balloting. And in 400 voting centers in four states
elections were repeated Wednesday because of the violence and
allegations of massive vote fraud.
   In northern Haryana state Wednesday, nine people died and 15
were injured when police opened fire on a crowd in Mehan, 60 miles
northwest of New Delhi, United News of India said. Army troops were
summoned to keep order in the region, where elections were
repeated, the Press Trust of India said.
   At least 85 people were killed by police, bombs or in factional
battles on Tuesday, 80 in the eastern state of Bihar, the poorest
Indian state and known for its organized criminal gangs.
   Political analysts said the Congress Party's defeat might
trigger large-scale defections from the party, which governed India
for most of its 42 years since independence. Three top Congress
Party members defected to the Janata Dal before the elections.
   But Biju Patnaik, chief minister of eastern Orissa state, said
Rajiv's 100-year-old party would rise again.

   Tracy Scoggins is suing Miss USA pageant
officials for $14 million, contending they gave the actress a car
with markings that might have lured an attacker she says pulled
down her dress in an elevator.
   The lawsuit filed Friday in state court says pageant directors
should have warned her she was a potential sexual assault victim
and provided her security and an escort.
   Ms. Scoggins was loaned a car with the words ``Miss Universe''
written on the side in bold letters, the lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit, which names Miss Universe Inc., sponsor of the Miss
USA contest, is the third multimillion-dollar suit filed since the
alleged attack two years ago at the Marriott Hotel in El Paso.
   Ms. Scoggins, who appeared in the television show ``The
Colbys,'' was in El Paso as co-host of the 1988 Miss USA Pageant.
   Her screams in the elevator led hotel employees to detain Ramon
Concepcion Padilla. The actress said she would not return to Texas
to testify against him because a grand jury reduced the charge to
misdemeanor sexual assault.
   The charge was dropped and Padilla sued for $20 million,
claiming his reputation was damaged. Ms. Scoggins countered with a
$4.5 million slander lawsuit against Padilla and his lawyer after
Padilla contended the actress invited him to her hotel room.
   Efforts to get comment from the pageant company were
unsuccessful. Sara Meza, spokeswoman for Madison Square Garden TV
Productions, which produces Miss Universe, said she had not seen
the lawsuit.

Imperial Household Agency said.
   The crown prince, who is regarded as Japan's most eligible
bachelor, had lived on his own only during studies at Oxford
University in England in 1983-85.
   His new two-story residence is about a 10 minute walk from his
parents' home in the same Akasaka Palace compound.
   Television footage showed the prince leaving in a car, with
Akihito, Empress Michiko and Naruhito's sister, Princess Nori,

   The Duke of Westminster, said to be Britain's

than 30 mph above the speed limit and was banned from driving for
two weeks.
   A magistrate in Stroud, in central England, also fined the
38-year-old duke, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, the equivalent of
$200.
   The duke's lawyer, Patrick Upward, said his client was traveling
from London to his country estate in northwestern England with his
wife and family when police clocked him driving at 106 mph for 3
miles. The speed limit for British highways is 70 mph.
   Upward said the duke is involved with 175 charities and
committees.
   ``He crisscrosses the country and to some extent the globe,''
the lawyer said. ``He has three cars, each of them 1-year-old and
each with over 30,000 miles on the clock. Almost of all of his
mileage is done while seeking to help the community.''
   The Grosvenor family fortune is estimated by London's Sunday
Times to be $5 billion, surpassed only by Queen Elizabeth II's $8.7
billion.

   Members of the rock group Aerosmith now
shun drugs but won't use the stage to deliver anti-drug messages to
teen-agers, lead singer Steven Tyler says.
   ``I will never go up on a soapbox and preach to the kids, `Don't
do, don't do, don't do.' I can only show them by example,'' Tyler
said in an interview published a day before a scheduled Wednesday
night concert.
   ``I can only say don't get started on drugs and try them because
it'll get you, grab you by the scruff of the neck just when you
think it's your best friend ... and it'll kill you.
   ``You only get three choices when you take drugs and that's
jail, death or insanity. I can assure them that. So when I do
articles and interviews, I talk about my past drug experiences with
needles, almost dying and how fortunate I am to come out of it and
be sane and still have my wits about me somewhat.''
   Boston-based Aerosmith is enjoying huge success with the album
``Pump'' only a few years after Tyler, guitarists Joe Perry and
Brad Whitford, drummer Joey Kramer and bassist Tom Hamilton
required treatment for drug dependency.
   ``We climbed out of this huge hole we'd dug ourselves and it
makes us feel a whole lot better about ourselves, our music and the
way we produce it,'' said Tyler. ``Fortunately for us, it shows in
the last two albums so well.''

<HEAD>High Court OKs Searches Overseas by U.S. Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. agents do not need warrants for searches
in other countries, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision
seen as bolstering the fight against drug smugglers and terrorists
_ and perhaps aiding the prosecution of ousted Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega.
   By a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld the warrantless search of the
home of a supected Mexican drug smuggler.
   Foreigners living abroad do not have the same rights as U.S.
citizens or aliens living here, the court said.
   In another decision, the court gave police broad new authority
to conduct sweeping searches in this country after making arrests
in private homes.
   Voting 7-2, the justices said police may use the evidence seized
when they arrested a Riverdale, Md., man accused of armed robbery.
The ruling reinstated his conviction and 35-year prison sentence.
   The court said police may search throughout a house when they
have a reasonable suspicion there is a hidden danger to the
arresting officers _ even if authorities lack a search warrant or
probable cause to believe there is a danger.
   In a third ruling, the court said states may make the death
penalty the only punishment for some murderers without violating
the Constitution's ban on mandatory death sentences. The court, by
a 5-4 vote, upheld a Pennsylvania law.
   In the drug-smuggling case, the court narrowed the Fourth
Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.
   Aliens are entitled to such constitutional safeguards only
``when they have come within the territory of the United States and
developed substantial connections with this country,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist said.
   Without mentioning the Noriega case, Rehnquist said,
``Situations threatening to important American interests may arise
halfway around the globe ... (that) require an American response
with armed force.''
   He added: ``If there are to be restrictions on searches and
seizures which occur incident to such American action, they must be
imposed by the political branches through diplomatic understanding,
treaty or legislation.''
   The ruling could help the government's prosecution of Noriega on
drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges from a 12-count
indictment handed down in February 1988.
   After U.S. troops invaded Panama in December to capture Noriega,
he surrendered and was brought to the United States to stand trial
in Florida.
   There has been speculation Noriega's lawyers might argue U.S.
armed forces illegally seized evidence in the invasion.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the high court's ruling
``recognizes the right and need of law enforcement officers to have
lawful, practical means of dealing with international drug
trafficking operations.''
   ``Drug traffickers and terrorists will take no cheer from the
court's opinion,'' Thornburgh said.
   The U.S. military is seeking to become more involved in fighting
drug smuggling by using spy satellites and other surveillance
techniques to track suspects in foreign countries.
   Wednesday's decision was denounced by the court's dissenters.
Justice William J. Brennan said the decision lets authorities
indiscriminately ``break down doors ... when the door being broken
belongs to a foreigner.''
   ``If we expect aliens to obey our laws, aliens should be able to
expect that we will obey our Constitution when we investigate,
prosecute and punish them. Lawlessness breeds lawlessness,''
Brennan said.
   Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun also dissented.
   Justices Byron R. White, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy joined Rehnquist in ruling
against suspected drug smuggler Rene Verdugo Urquidez. He was
convicted in California in 1988 of taking part in the 1985
kidnapping, torture and murder of Drug Enforcement Administration
agent Enrique Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Verdugo is serving a sentence of 240 years plus life, and will
not be eligible for parole until he is 96.
   His drug conviction and sentence in the murders were not at
issue in the high court case. The search warrant issue arose in a
separate, although related, prosecution.
   After he was arrested and turned over to U.S. agents, his home
in Mexicali, Mexico, was searched by DEA agents in 1988 with
cooperation from Mexican authorities.
   The DEA seized a tally sheet that the agency said shows the
quantities of marijuana smuggled into the United States by Verdugo.
   A U.S. appeals court ruled the search was unlawful because the
DEA agents lacked a warrant from an American judge.
   Government lawyers said requiring warrants in such cases could
hamper the campaign against drug smugglers. The DEA has offices in
45 nations, and in 1988 alone it said it helped in investigations
that led to 1,200 arrests of suspected drug smugglers in foreign
countries.

<HEAD>Demands for Democracy Meet Tear Gas, Tears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West African leaders whose nations
have been hit by recent demonstrations for democracy have responded
in different ways, from tear gas to tears.
   The region's beleaguered leaders have confronted waves of
protests, strikes and public dissatisfaction in the Ivory Coast,
Benin, Gabon, Gambia and Niger.
   In Benin, Mathieu Kerekou, the authoritarian Marxist
brigadier-general who seized control of the country in 1972, sobbed
openly before a national conference Tuesday when delegates demanded
he resign.
   He accused them of ``attempting a civilian coup,'' and said he
preferred to be ousted. Resignation would betray the people's
trust, he said.
   Kerekou was forced to call the conference after violent protests
in which several people were killed at the end of last year.
Rioters stoned a statue of Lenin and burned pictures of Kerekou,
who in December renounced the Marxist-Leninist policies that have
bankrupted Benin.
   In the nearby Ivory Coast, a pillar of stability and civilian
government in a region plagued by power-hungry military men,
conservative President Felix Houphouet-Boigny had to order soldiers
and riot police to suppress protests last week by rebellious
students calling for multiparty democracy.
   Tear gas, stun grenades and truncheons were let loose in Abidjan
on demonstrators usually armed only with signs.
   But Houphouet-Boigny, who has governed since the country's 1960
independence from France, responded positively to more moderate
demands for cuts in Cabinet ministers' salaries and the cost of
board and lodging at the state university.
   The Ivorian leader has rejected previous demands for a
multiparty state, arguing that the system endangers national unity
on a continent wracked by tribal rivalries.
   France, apparently intent on safeguarding its interests in
former colonies, apparently agrees. Paris recently advised Guinea
to model political reforms on the Ivory Coast, not a multiparty
democracy.
   ``There are some multiparty states that have no democracy and
some one-party states that practice democracy ... like Ivory
Coast,'' former French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac commented in
Abidjan this week.
   Omar Bongo of Gabon, another beleaguered West African leader,
identified the immediate cause of strikes and protests in the
region. He blamed ``falling purchasing power provoked by the
austerity programs of the International Monetary Fund'' in an
interview with Radio France International this week.
   Bongo's 22-year-old civilian rule is threatened by strikes and
protests that have closed Libreville's airport, electricity cuts
that caused the deaths of five patients in the capital's hospital
Wednesday, and rampaging students who forced schools to close.
   This week's strikes are over dissatisfaction with political
reforms announced Friday, including the replacement of the
discredited Democratic Party with a Social Democratic Rally which
Bongo said is open to all political ideas.
   The change falls short of promises Bongo made after an Octoe
coup attempt to consider transforming Gabon into a multiparty
democracy.
   The upheaval in Gabon follows 10 years of recession caused by
slumping prices of the commodities that underpin African economies.
It has brought unemployment, salary cuts, and inflation.
   Austerity measures forced by the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank in return for loans have caused hardships that
protesters say have become unbearable.
   Ivorian authorities this week proposed cuts of between 15
percent and 40 percent in the salaries of government employees who
have suffered an eight-year wage freeze, in addition to a new 10
percent income tax.
   For a messenger earning the minimum wage of $125, that means
earning 25 percent less in a country where a bag of rice to feed a
family for a month costs $30 and rent for two rooms more than $40.
   Ivory Coast is one of the luckier countries. The minimum monthly
salary in Ghana, Nigeria or Sierra Leone is not enough to buy a bag
of rice.
   The International Monetary Fund and World Bank are easy targets
for attack. Gambian reporter Baboucar M. Gaye coined a new term:
``Our country has been IMF'd,'' he declared in a report.
   He said economic problems are compounded by the convertible
Central African franc of 11 West African states that is
underwritten by the French treasury and is set at an inflated rate
that encourages huge import and customs duties and discourages
foreign investors.
   Bata shoe company, which operates in the most ecnomically
difficult African nations including Marxist Ethiopia, closed its
factory in Ivory Coast because smugglers could import shoes more
cheaply than the company could import its raw materials.
   The World Bank official also pointed to the corruption and
lavish official lifestyles that have drained state coffers and
angered impoverished West Africans into revolt.
   Gambians criticized extravagant celebrations in February marking
25 years of independence from Britain that were attended by
Britain's Princess Anne and George Bush, Jr., the U.S. president's
son.
   ``Most Gambians are muttering privately that the state of
austerity should have compelled us to forgo any celebrations,''
Gaye said.
   Some leaders blame unidentified outside sources for their
troubles.
   Niger's Gen. Ali Saibou, Wednesday accused ``a small group of
malcontents ... plotting to destabilize and throw (Niger) into
chaos'' of engineering violent student protests in which troops
have killed at least three demonstrators.
   Saibou promised democracy when he led a 1987 coup, but recently
declared the military would not surrender power and announced plans
for a constitution allowing only one political party.

caused by the Nov. 15 storm that officials want to pay $120,000 to
upgrade the radar at the local office of the National Weather
Service.
   The Weather Service says no thanks.
   Federal officials plan to close the Huntsville office and more
than 100 others while installing the $450 million Next Generation
Weather Radar, dubbed Nexrad.
   Huntsville officials worry they won't be close enough to Nexrad
units to benefit from the advanced technology. But the system is
eagerly awaited in other parts of the Southeast that have been
blindsided by killer storms.
   ``People are not being warned in time,'' said Gil Patrick, a
meteorologist for WALB-TV in Albany, Ga. In nearby Colquitt County,
two people were killed Oct. 1 by a tornado unseen by the nearest
weather service radar in Columbus, Ga.
   Patrick thinks planned Nexrad units in Atlanta, Jacksonville,
Fla., and Tuskegee will help southwest Georgia.
   North Carolina's congressional delegation is pushing for the
earliest possible installation of Nexrad in Raleigh. An unexpected
tornado killed four people in the eastern part of the state Nov.
28, 1988, while the weather radar unit in Raleigh was awaiting
repair.
   The new system, scheduled to be complete by 1996, can follow the
movement of moisture in the air; the current system can only
measure how much moisture is present. Meteorologists say the
improvement will allow them to identify tornadoes before they
descend earthward.
   ``It holds the promise of increasing the lead time for tornado
warnings from the current average of three minutes to as much as 30
minutes,'' said Curtis Stanford, a staff member of the House
subcommittee that oversees the weather service.
   The extra time would have been precious to Husman. In addition
to the employee who died, Husman and four others were hurt when the
Golbro jewelry store was demolished by the Huntsville tornado.
   ``Thirty minutes would have made a great deal of difference in
what we could have done,'' he said. ``We couldn't have done much to
save our business, but we could have done something to prevent
death and injury.''
   The day of the storm, Husman heard news reports about the
possibility of severe weather, ``but the warnings were no more
serious than we get with normal thunderstorms.
   ``Certainly there was no thought of immediate danger, right
until the time the roof fell on my head.''
   The weather service issued a tornado warning as the storm hit.
The tornado killed 20, injured 463 and drove 500 people from their
homes. It also called sharp attention to the weather service's
proposal to put the closest Nexrad units in Birmingham and in
Nashville, Tenn., each about 100 miles from Huntsville.
   Blair Conrad of the Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority
said the weakpoint of the weather service plan is that Nexrad's
capability to measure speed and direction of moisture in the air
diminishes beyond about 70 miles.
   Don Sarreals, assistant to the director of the Nexrad program
office, acknowledges the curvature of the Earth prevents the radar
beams from picking up lower-altitude funnels more than 92 miles
away. But the weather service contends Nexrad can spot telltale
cyclone patterns that occur at altitudes of 10,000 feet to 15,000
feet, within 125 nautical miles.
   Gary Petti of the weather service's Birmingham office said a
Nexrad unit in Huntsville might have missed the November tornado
because of its close range.
   The weather service has 249 offices, including 52 fully staffed
forecasting offices, said Sarreals. The agency plans to shut down
small offices and reorganize into 113 fully staffed offices, plus
13 river forecast centers.
   The service's 113 Nexrad units will work in conjunction with 24
to be run by the Pentagon.
   While Congress has been enthusiastic about Nexrad, many members
are concerned that some of the planned office closings are
motivated as much by the need for budget cuts as the advent of the
new radar, Stanford said.
   A provision in the federal budget this year prohibits the
closing of any weather station unless the weather service first
puts into place the Nexrad unit and runs tests to show the affected
area will not suffer a loss in service.

   Ash Wednesday dawned in this heavily Roman
Catholic city, with thousands attending Mass and workers raking up
tons of garbage left by a raucous, record-setting Mardi Gras crowd
of 1.5 million.
   ``It was a much different picture in the French Quarter this
morning,'' said Tom Finney, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New
Orleans. ``Some of the people who went to the 6 o'clock Mass at St.
Louis Cathedral were still wearing Mardi Gras beads, but they were
a lot quieter than they were Tuesday.''
   Nowhere was the contrast between Fat Tuesday and Ash Wednesday
more evident than at Pat O'Brien's famous patio bar in the quarter.
   Employee Michele Dolaway said the bar, packed with rowdy
revelers on Tuesday, opened at 10 a.m. Wednesday to welcome a
smaller, gentler crowd.
   ``A lot of people want to just sit on the patio or in the piano
bar and have one last hurricane,'' she said. ``And then there are
some who just need a little of the hair of the dog.''
   Layers of debris that covered the St. Charles Avenue parade
route included paper, cracked drink coolers, fast-food containers
and discarded or lost clothing.
   ``If you can gauge a good time by how much people left behind,
everyone left this one very, very happy,'' said James W. Lee Jr.,
director of sanitation.
   Workers will have collected more than 2,000 tons of trash by
Friday, up from 1,895 tons last year, Lee said.
   Arrest figures were not available Wednesday but Deputy Police
Chief Arnesta Taylor said he thought arrests went down perhaps by
25 percent this year, despite the crowd.
   Tourists took their time leaving the city. Wednesday morning
crowds at the New Orleans International airport were light but
afternoon and Thursday flights were heavily booked, said Larry
Johnson, chief of airfield operations.
   ``I guess most people booked late flights so they'd have the
morning to sober up,'' he said.

   A terminally ill student who needs a bone marrow
donor gets support from Dustin Hoffman. No, it's not a Hollywood
tear-jerker, it's a real-life drama.
   The Oscar-winning actor has made a six-figure donation and has
taken a lead role in a plea for Allison Atlas, who was told in
August she had three to six months to live unless a marrow
transplant checked her leukemia.
   ``If we find a donor, we'd literally be taking someone off death
row,'' Hoffman said. ``There's a clock ticking which she's aware
of. It's a hideous clock.''
   Miss Atlas is one of more than 9,000 people awaiting a donor.
About 25 people die each day from blood diseases that could be
cured through marrow transplants, according to the Life-Savers
Foundation of America, a non-profit group that recruits donors and
raises money for blood tests.
   A teen-ager who was the object of a nationwide donor search died
last week in Silver Spring, Md. JoAnne Johnson, 19, had the support
of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and singer Dionne Warwick, but no donor
was found in time.
   About 15 families have appealed for donors. Yet something about
Miss Atlas, a 20-year-old business major at New York University and
a resident of Bethesda, Md., got Hoffman involved.
   ``It's hard to explain. It picked me,'' said Hoffman, winner of
Academy Awards for best actor for last year's ``Rain Man'' and for
the 1979 ``Kramer vs. Kramer.''
   ``I've always done things privately and would have preferred to
have kept it that way. But in this case, there was no other way I
could help,'' Hoffman said Tuesday.
   He refused to say how much money he gave, but his publicist
confirmed it was more than $100,000.
   Hoffman has asked his show business friends to help. And he said
he'll pick up the tab for a vacation for the donor who matches Miss
Atlas.
   ``I got a two-week vacation for anywhere they want to go in the
world. I'm treating,'' he said.
   Miss Atlas has a type of leukemia that rarely strikes anyone
under age 65. The disease defeats the body's ability to make blood
cells, but transplanted bone marrow can correct that.
   No matches for her marrow type were found among family members
or the 70,000 names registered by the Minnesota-based National Bone
Marrow Donor Registry, which was created by Congress in 1986.
   So the Atlas family went public in November. Since then, more
than 16,000 people offered to be donors and $1.3 million was
pledged to pay for tests, according to the family. Each test costs
$75.
   Because of the family's efforts, 25 to 50 potential donors were
found for other people in her condition, according to registry
officials.
   ``The Atlas family drive is going to result in many lives being
saved,'' said Liz Quam, spokeswoman for the registry.
   Marrow, a blood-colored substance with the consistency of jelly,
makes blood cells and the body's disease-fighting tools.
   In adult transplants, a quart of marrow is drawn from the hip
bone and injected into the diseased person after intense radiation
and chemotherapy kills all cancer cells. About 300 transplants have
been done during the past two years.
   The donor requires an overnight hospital stay. The body replaces
donated marrow within three weeks.
   The odds of finding a donor are about one in 20,000. The
registry hopes to have a pool of 250,000 names, which would cost
about $15 million.
   Meanwhile, Miss Atlas gets a blood transfusion every three to
four weeks and waits. She is the youngest of three children of
Alvin Atlas, owner of a clothing store.
   ``Time is of the essence for every leukemia victim. We've come
very close. It's just a matter of getting the right person to come
to one of our drives,'' said the soft-spoken, brown-eyed Miss Atlas.
   She is thrilled and grateful for Hoffman's support.
   ``He's just been so beneficial to us. I don't know if it's fate
or what,'' Miss Atlas said. ``It's my only hope.''

<HEAD>U.S. Politicians Surprised at Ortega's Acceptance of Defeat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many American politicians who for years
condemned Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega as an untrustworthy
Marxist aggressor are reacting with surprise over his quiet
acceptance of electoral defeat.
   Others say that a careful examination of the record will show
that Ortega, in an utterly consistent fashion, always kept his word
_ once he gave it.
   But still others point out that Nicaragua is now entering a
period of political transition with Ortega's Sandinistas in firm
control of a large standing army and with Ortega himself
proclaiming that the nation's revolution has not been extinguished.
   ``The story sure isn't over,'' said former Sen. Daniel Evans,
R-Wash., who briefed the Senate Republican Caucus this week on his
experiences as an official observer of the Nicaraguan election
process.
   Refering to Ortega's concession of defeat by Violeta Chamorro,
Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said, ``I was really caught off guard;
I was basically surprised.''
   ``I thought we were going to have another Noriega situation,''
Heflin said, referring to now-deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel
Antonio Noriega's nullification of his country's presidential
elections last year.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who for years
denounced Ortega and the Sandinistas for allegedly exporting
revolution throughout Central America, wasn't ready to to
philosophize about why Ortega permitted a fair election and why he
didn't quibble about the results.
   ``He's defeated; I haven't tried to analyze him,'' Dole said.
``I just enjoyed the results.''
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska., said he believes Ortega and the
Sandinistas simply bowed to reality. The severe impact of Reagan's
economic sanctions made defeat inevitable, he said, adding, ``I'm
going to call President Reagan and tell him that.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who was denied permission by the
Sandinista government to lead a team of congressional election
observers to Nicaragua, said he believes Ortega has undergone ``an
evolution of style.''
   ``It is surprising,'' Lugar said of Ortega's concession without
a struggle.
   ``But I suppose equally surprising was his conduct in the last
few weeks as he adopted Western campaign techniques, dispensing
with much of his security apparatus'' and campaigning voter to
voter, rally to rally, Lugar said.
   Now, Lugar said, Ortega has transformed himself into ``an
important opposition figure.''
   Evans said he believes the Sandinistas have not chosen to change
the election results by military force because ``there was a
recognition that if they were to use the power of his army Ortega
would initiate a bloody, bloody conflict in every city and on every
street.''
   ``I think there was also a feeling that, well, we didn't win
this one, but there will be another time, another day and at some
point we could well be back in power,'' he said, noting that the
next presidential election is scheduled in six years.
   Looking at the troubles that lie ahead for Nicaragua, Evans
noted that Mrs. Chamorro's UNO coalition spans the political
spectrum from the far right to the Nicaraguan Communist Party and
is therefore fragile.
   Moreover, compared to the Sandinistas, who have a decade of
government experience behind them, the UNO coalition is ``terribly
weak in terms of expertise,'' Evans said.
   He noted that the Sandinistas will still be in control of many
municipalities and will retain strong representation in the
national assembly and on every important elected body.
   ``The Sandinistas still have the army, a party army,'' Evans
said. ``UNO's task is to change that, take command and reduce the
size of the armed forces.''
   Mrs. Chamorro and her coalition will inherit an economy in ruins
and despite the fact that much of the blame can be attributed to
Sandinista mismanagement, Ortega will be looking to exploit his
successor's mistakes, Evans said.
   ``As events unfold in Nicaragua, I fear that the tendency in the
United States will be to give a deep sigh of relief and move on and
pay little further attention,'' Evans said. ``And that would be a
tragedy.''

<HEAD>Congressman Says ATVs Still Causing Deaths Despite Court Agreement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court-backed agreement on safety measures
for all-terrain vehicles has failed to result in the expected sharp
decline in injuries and deaths, the chairman of a House panel said
Wednesday.
   Rep. Doug Barnard, D-Ga., whose subcommittee helped prompt a
1988 agreement banning new sales of three-wheeled off-the-road
vehicles, questioned the agressiveness of the federal Consumer
Product Safety Commission in enforcing safety provisions for ATVs.
   ``Your advocacy, to me, comes short,'' Barnard told commission
chairman Jacqueline Jones-Smith.
   In a hearing before Barnard's House Government Operations
subcommittee, safety experts said that off-road vehicles remain
inherently unstable and deceptively dangerous for their riders.
   They said that there are some 2.5 million of the existing
three-wheeled models and the newer four-wheel versions, many of
them ridden primarily by children. They said an agreement by
manufacturers not to sell adult-sized vehicles for use by children
under 16 is being ignored.
   ``ATVs are kid-killers, plain and simple,'' said Charles Chvala,
a Wisconsin state senator who is pushing state legislation to
restrict the vehicles.
   The industry defended its action and safety record.
   ``Riding an ATV is far less risky than a number of other popular
activities,'' said Howard P. Willens, lobbyist for distributers of
Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki and Yamaha brand vehicles.
   Distributors of the three- and four-wheeled vehicles agreed to a
consent decree with the federal government in 1988 on safety steps
for ATVs. The order, signed by federal Judge Gerhard Gesell, was in
response to a suit by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, after
congressional hearings.
   As part of the agreement, the industry agreed to sell only
four-wheeled versions in the future, but there was no recall of
existing three-wheel models. It also required safety warnings and
public awareness campaigns, and sale of adult-size vehicles only
for use by people 16 or over.
   Jones-Smith defended that agreement and the commission's
enforcement. She said deaths and injuries due to the vehicles have
declined from 350 in 1986 to approximately 300 annually. About 40
percent of the deaths are children under 16, she said.
   She said an undercover investigation by the CPSC staff found a
majority of dealers recommended vehicles not appropriate for a
purchaser seeking a vehicle for a 13-year-old child. She said
distributers should take steps to make their dealers comply with
age requirements.
   Janine Jagger, assistant professor of neurosurgery at the
University of Virginia, said the consent decree ``is a safety
sham'' that has not lessened risk or changed ``the practices of
this irresponsible and arrogant industry.''
   Willens, the industry lobbyist, said the injury rate has dropped
52 percent since 1985, and the fatality rate 27 percent.
   Willens said most fatalities were due to ``extreme forms of
vehicle misuse.''
   Barnard said he was concerned deaths have not declined further
and called on the commission to face whether continuing levels of
death and injury with ATVs are ``reasonable.''
   ``I do not think it is reasonable to accept 300 deaths per year,
mostly children, and tens of thousands of injuries,'' he said.

<HEAD>Christian Forces Exchange Fire; Religious Leaders Demand
Cease-Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian forces dueled with
mortars and machine guns in east Beirut Wednesday and their
religious leaders demanded an immediate cease-fire in the one-month
showdown.
   No casualties were reported in the intermittent exchanges in
Ashrafiyeh, held by the Lebanese Forces under Samir Geagea, and on
the city's southeastern edge, controlled by Gen. Michel Aoun's
troops.
   By police count, the showdown for control of the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave has killed 694 people and wounded 1,934 since it
broke out Jan. 30. A shaky cease-fire has been in effect since Feb.
17.
   After a three-hour meeting, spiritual leaders of Christian sects
demanded Aoun and Geagea respect the cease-fire, withdraw their
forces, reopen all roads and end the vitriolic propaganda campaigns.
   The leaders, who met at the seat of Maronite Catholic patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir in Bkirki, north of Beirut, also asked that Aoun
and Geagea begin a political dialogue after implementing the
security arrangements.
   Geagea said in a statement he would comply with the clerics'
peace plan and said he hoped Aoun would follow suit.
   ``We hope that a similar decision will be taken by the other
side and that the spiritual leaders will directly supervise the
conduct of the plan,'' Geagea said.
   There was no immediate reaction from Aoun.
   But the plan differed sharply from Aoun's earlier demand that a
political agreement be reached with Geagea before Aoun withdraws
his 19,000 soldiers from the embattled districts of east Beirut and
other sectors.
   Geagea has demanded a ``normalization of the situation'' between
his 6,000-strong militia and Aoun's troops prior to any political
talks.
   Sfeir, addressing the churchmen, said peace was ``God's gift to
man. Nevertheless, peace is made by man. We call on the leaders to
make peace.''
   Both Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Catholic community that
has dominated Lebanon since its independence from France in 1943.
   A three-man mediation committee said it would resume deadlocked
efforts to work out a settlement to the worst fighting among
Christians in the nearly 15-year-old civil war.
   ``We are going through a very delicate and difficult era,'' said
Shaker Abu Suleiman, a member of the mediation committee who
attended part of the meeting at Bkirki.
   Aoun wants the Lebanese Forces to disband and become a political
organization. Geagea refuses to break up his military force.
   In September 1988 Aoun was appointed head of an interim military
Cabinet by outgoing President Amin Gemayel after parliament failed
to elect a successor.
   But on Nov. 24 the Lebanese Parliament elected Elias Hrawi
president, backed by Syria, which has 40,000 troops in Lebanon
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate. Aoun considers the Syrians an
occuption army.
   Hrawi fired Aoun as army chief and caretaker premier, but the
general refused to step down, alleging Hrawi's election was
unconstitutional. Aoun considers himself the sole legitimate
authority in Lebanon.
   In another development, the daily An-Nahar said a Panamanian
freighter, the Atlantic 3, unloaded its shipment of Iraqi weapons
at the Lebanese Forces port of jounieh a week ago, bolstering the
militia's position.
   The paper said Iraq sent Aoun the shipment more than four months
ago, but tried to recall it when the Arab League announced a peace
plan. Instead, the captain dropped anchor off Malta and said he
would deliver to whoever paid.
   The Lebanese Forces paid, the paper said, without elaborating on
the price or contents.

   The Internal Revenue Service is processing tax
returns at a near record pace and promising refunds in about four
weeks.
   During the first half of the filing season, 31.9 million returns
were received by the IRS, about 30 percent of the total expected
this year. Receipts through Feb. 23 were 3.6 percent higher than a
year ago.
   The agency said Wednesday that it has processed 19.4 percent
more returns than at this time last year, 18.1 million compared
with 15.1 million. More than half the processed returns, 9.9
million, have produced refunds, up 20.3 percent from last year.
   This year's refunds are averaging $868, compared with $825
during the same period last year. Refunds have totaled $8.6
billion, up 26.5 percent. ``Those who file returns before the
last-minute rush can expect refunds in about four weeks,'' the IRS
said.
   More than 2.5 million taxpayers have opted for refunds within
about two weeks by filing their returns electronically through
companies authorized by the IRS. By comparison, about 645,000
electronic returns were received during the same period last year.
   Electronic filing is available in every state this year,
although only to taxpayers who are due refunds.

<HEAD>West Germans Ask Who Will Pay the Price of Resettlers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BOEHMER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The welcome mat for East German
immigrants is wearing thin as overcrowded resettlement centers and
fears of higher taxes remind West Germans of the cost of
hospitality.
   Throughout the country, West German politicians are toning down
the euphoria over East Germany's open borders and encouraging
resettlers to return home to help rebuild their country.
   At least one major conservative politician, Gov. Lothar Spaeth
of Baden-Wuerttemburg state, has even suggested East Germans be
paid to go home, a strategy used to encourage Turkish guest workers
to leave several years ago.
   ``We helped the Turks return. So why shouldn't we do the same
for these people?'' asked Spaeth, of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
Christian Democratic Union.
   When the mostly young, skilled East Germans began their exodus
last fall, West Germans credited them with forcing democratic
change in their homeland. But the more than 100,000 who have
arrived already this year are increasingly seen as taking advantage
of West Germany's liberal policies.
   Under West Germany's Constitution, they are granted automatic
citizenship and are eligible for the same social benefits as West
German taxpayers. Impatience with them appears to be on the rise.
   The Hamburg-based weekly magazine Stern said in this week's
edition that more than two-thirds of 1,012 West Germans questioned
in a recent poll wanted to halt East German resettlement.
   In recent weeks, police had to be called to quell fights between
drunken East Germans at resettlement centers in Saarland and North
Rhine-Westphalia state, Stern said.
   North Rhine-Westphalia already has stopped 64 towns from
accepting more resettlers because of overcrowding, the magazine
said.
   Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported Sunday that in the northern
port city of Bremen, the local government is refusing to accept
more East German resettlers but is continuing to allow asylum
seekers from the Third World.
   In one Bremen resettlement center, 87 East German men share one
toilet, two washing machines, a small table and two chairs, the
newspaper said. They sleep in double-deck army cots in a school
gymnasium, said the report.
   ``The gymnasium is not an isolated case,'' the newspaper said.
``About 350 (East) Germans are living in Bremen gymnasiums.''
   West Germans complain that East German resettlers are given
preferential treatment in social and unemployment pay and are
overcrowding the already strapped housing market.
   Resettlers who quit work to come to the West are eligible for
immediate unemployment pay, which averages about $588 a month.
   West Germans who switch jobs must wait 12 weeks to be eligible
for unemployment, Stern said.
   Each East German also receives a one-time payment of $117 in
``welcome money,'' and East Germans are eligible for low-interest
loans of $1,765 to $5,880 to set up households.
   The left-leaning Social Democratic Party has said Kohl's
conservative government should try harder to persuade East Germans
to remain in their homeland.
   ``With the reforms there now, there is no reason they should
leave,'' said Gov. Oskar Lafontaine of Saarland state, a Social
Democrat who is expected to be Kohl's top challenger for chancellor
in December elections.
   Estimates of the costs of rebuilding East Germany and putting
the two states under a single currency have been as high as $58.8
billion, and there are increased fears that West Germans will pay
much of this in higher taxes.
   ``You know whose going to pay for all this,'' said Frankfurt
restaurant owner Peter Blisch. ``We the taxpayers, and it won't be
cheap.''
   Alexander Schwerein of the Christian Democrats said a tax
increase ``cannot be discounted'' if elections March 18 in East
Germany do not result in a stable government.
   But Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, has said that uniting
the two Germanys ``can be realized without a tax increase.''

   It wasn't the kind of event Capitol Hill's
newshounds usually cover, but when Leader, R-Kan., and Chelsea
Marie, R-S.C., appeared with their eight puppies Wednesday,
journalists flocked to the canine briefing.
   ``Event of the decade! Dole-Thurmond Pups Coming to
Washington,'' trumpeted a press release handed out in advance by
Leader's owner, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole.
   As reporters oohed and aahed, Chelsea Marie's owner, Sen. Strom
Thurmond carried a basketfull of 5-week-old schnauzer puppies into
the ornate room, carefully placing them on a table draped with
green felt. A plastic cover was hidden underneath in case of an
accident.
   Thurmond's wife, Nancy, clutched Chelsea Marie, while Dole tried
to control Leader.
   ``I think Leader has something else in mind,'' Dole quipped as
he handed the energetic schnauzer to his wife, Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole.
   The Doles were joined by Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., and
his wife, Penny, who are planning to take one of the puppies as a
replacement for Heidi, their schnauzer who died two weeks ago.
   Dole assured the group that schnuzers were ``bipartisan dogs.''
Leader, he said, ``barks at everybody.''
   The cuddly balls of fur with blue or pink ribbons around their
necks _ five puppies are boys and three are girls _ were the result
of a trip Leader took to Aiken, S.C., Thurmond said.
   ``He enjoyed his venture down there,'' said the 87-year-old
Thurmond, the father of four children ages 13 to 18.
   In South Carolina, the puppies have been big news. ``When Strom
announced, the dogs were on the front page and Strom was inside,''
Dole said, referring to Thurmond's recent decision to run for a
seventh term.
   Most of the puppies already are taken.
   Two will go to Mrs. Dole's relatives in Raleigh, N.C., while two
more will be auctioned off at charity events. The Thurmonds are
charged with finding homes for the remaining three.
   Leader has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill since Mrs.
Dole adopted him from the pound and gave him to her husband when he
was named majority leader in 1984. The Doles have no children,
although Dole has a daughter by his first marriage.
   Dole said he invited President Bush's dog, Millie, to the press
conference. ``She was tied up in meetings,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>South African Zulu Leader Urges Bush to Lift Sanctions Against
Pretoria</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi,
a Zulu leader, conferred Wednesday on how to end apartheid in South
Africa, and both agreed that black-on-black violence in Natal
Province must stop.
   Buthelezi said afterwards he urged Bush to lift economic
sanctions as soon as he legally can.
   The chief, a longtime foe of sanctions, said isolating South
Africa just ``minimizes economic growth and maximizes black
misery.''
   Bush has expressed his own reservations about sanctions, but
aides said later his main interest in the Oval Office meeting was
in discussing ways to negotiate an end to apartheid, the system of
racial discrimination that Pretoria has used to enforce white
minority rule.
   Buthelezi is chief minister of the tribal homeland of KwaZulu
and president of the 1.5-million member Inkatha movement, which has
opposed the African National Congress' guerrilla tactics and
advocacy of sanctions.
   Buthelezi told reporters that black disunity is the biggest
obstacle to negotiations with the de Klerk government to end
apartheid.
   Black-against-black fighting in Natal Province has claimed more
than 2,500 lives in the past three years. Nelson Mandela, the
African National Congress leader released from prison Feb. 11 after
27 years, appealed in Durban last Sunday for an end to that strife.
   To negotiate an end to apartheid, ``we as blacks must get our
act together. I really feel that the biggest obstacle to
negotiations taking off are these cleavages in the black community
itself,'' said Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi deplored the violence in Natal. Like Mandela, he said,
``I, too, demand that blacks throw their guns, knives, spears,
pangas and other instruments of death into the sea.''
   Buthelezi said his ``gut feeling'' is that Bush will lift
sanctions as soon as possible. But the Zulu leader said, ``He
didn't express it in so many words.''
   Buthelezi said he believes South African President F.W. de Klerk
is honest and sincere. ``He has burned the bridges behind him. We
can only go forward,'' the chief said.
   Buthelezi said last week in Johannesburg that he was the target
of a ``sordid'' smear campaign by some ANC activists depicting him
as the main cause of the Natal conflict.
   Bush has invited Mandela and de Klerk for White House visits,
but no dates have been set.

<HEAD>Peres Says Disarray in Likud Could Prevent Peace Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres said Wednesday he
believes disarray in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc could block progress in the U.S.-backed peace process.
   Peres, head of the left-leaning Labor Party, said in an
interview with The Associated Press that Shamir's ``basic problem
right now is to keep his party together'' as Likud hard-liners put
increasing pressure on him to reject U.S.-proposed compromises.
   Asked if Shamir was likely to accept the compromises urged by
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III to get preliminary
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks under way, Peres said: ``I have my
doubts.''
   He also repeated his warning that if Shamir's party does not
move ahead with the peace process, his Labor Party may bolt from
the coalition government.
   ``If there won't be a prospect for peace, there is no reason for
us to remain in the government,'' Peres said.
   Shamir faces a rebellion from hard-liners in his party. Former
Trade Minister Ariel Sharon, who quit the Cabinet two weeks ago,
has threatened to convene Likud's decision-making Central Committee
next week to challenge Shamir's policies. Sharon heads the
committee, while Shamir is the chairman of the party.
   Sharon appeared Wednesday to be trying to lower the public
debate, telling army radio: ``I think that as the situation becomes
worse, we have to be quieter.''
   Several other Likud legislators, however, said they would
support a vote of no confidence against Shamir in Parliament if he
agrees to a U.S.-backed formula that would involve Palestinians
from east Jerusalem or Palestinian deportees in peace talks.
   Likud hard-liners fear such an approach could lead to a role for
the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist organization, or a
threat to Israel's control of Arab east Jerusalem, annexed by
Israel after its capture in the 1967 Middle East War.
   But Shamir said he believed the opposition within Likud was much
broader that just the issues of east Jerusalem and deportees.
   ``The issue today in the Likud Party is they oppose the nature
of the whole move. ... They think it's the wrong way to go,'' Peres
said.
   Baker has been attempting to bridge differences between Israel
and the Palestinians over how to start talks on Israel's plan for
elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The vote is
designed to lead to limited self-rule for 1.7 million Palestinians
and eventual talks on the final status of the occupied lands.
   Peres, whose party agrees to Baker's suggestions, has given
Shamir a March 7 deadline to approve them.
   ``We are nearing the real decision now.'' Peres said. ``In a
week or so we shall see what is happening.''
   The Likud-Labor coaltion has been torn at least four times in
the past year over how to proceed with Shamir's election plan, but
Peres said the current crisis was ``more serious than previous
ones.''
   ``They (Likud) have reached the point where they have to make up
their mind,'' he said.
   Peres also said that if he forms a new government, he will
continue to back the election plan rather seek a new peace formula.
``If there was a new government it would stay with the current
approach,'' Peres said.
   Asked how the changes sweeping East Europe might affect the
Middle East, Peres said, ``it will affect us greatly and deeply.''
   He said that as the Soviet Union reduces its support for leftist
regimes, Arab nations will be forced to shift toward democratic
reforms.
   ``A few years ago, nobody would think that Jordan would have
elections ... that Russia would take resolves in their relations
with Syria,'' Peres said, referring to a Soviet diplomat's call for
Syria to stop seeking military parity with Israel.
   Asked about possible German unification, Peres said the Germans
should first tell Poland that they respect current borders and
should reassure the Jews by ``confronting very strongly ...
nationalistic or anti-Semitic forces.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To excel again in math and science, schools
must change teaching methods and Americans must change their
attitude that such subjects are ``too hard and too weird,''
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said Wednesday.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said more federal money is needed to
update equipment for science education.
   Cavazos told a subcommittee of the House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology, ``Perhaps it is ambitious, courageous, maybe
even a little rash'' to set a national education goal that American
students will be first in the world in mathematics and science
achievement in 10 years _ a goal approved by President Bush and the
nation's governors Sunday.
   ``We can do it, but only if we make fundamental changes in math
and science education,'' said Cavazos, who added that ``on every
recent international test of math and science achievement, U.S.
students have scored at or near the bottom.''
   The Education Department has requested $24.6 billion for fiscal
1991. Cavazos said Bush's budget includes $230 million for the
Eisenhower Mathematics and Science program, which supports efforts
to improve math and science teaching and increase opportunities for
women and minorities in these fields.
   There should be ``better teacher preparation,'' said Cavazos.
``We need to introduce science earlier and in an innovative way,
and we need to make our math curriculum more intense.
   ``Studies of mathematics curricula have shown that, in contrast
to other countries, U.S. students are exposed to a repetitious,
slow-moving curriculum that, until eighth grade or even later,
consists almost completely of low-level arithmetic skills.''
   Cavazos also said, ``We must change the way we as a nation think
about math and science. For too long, our national attitude has
been that science and math are too hard and too weird for most
people to learn, and that in any case they are irrelevant and
unimportant to the everyday life of `normal' people.''
   At a nearby hearing of the House Committee on Education and
Labor, Williams questioned the administration's commitment to
education. He said educators have told him of the struggles schools
have ``trying to prepare tomorrow's scientists'' with 20-year-old
equipment.
   ``Let's just take as a fact that equipment has to be improved,''
Williams said in questioning Charles Kolb, who oversees the
Education Department's budget. ``What would you think we should use
to buy new equipment? Peanuts, chocolates, Hershey bars, or would
you suggest that maybe the transfer of money would be needed to buy
the new equipment.''
   ``The transfer of money,'' answered Kolb.
   ``That's the point,'' Williams said.
   Kolb said increased funding will not necessarily improve student
achievement in math and science, or any other subjects. He noted
that ``as aggregate elementary and secondary education spending in
the United States rose by 27 percent from 1980 to 1988, scores on
national reading and writing tests remained virtually unchanged.''
   M. Edith Rasell and Lawrence Mishel of the Economic Policy
Institute said that the United States does not spend huge amounts
on education and pointed to their study that showed the United
States spends relatively less on elementary and secondary education
than 13 other industrial countries.

   Martin Luther King III, whose remarks to a school
group about homosexuality angered gay-rights groups, said Wednesday
he opposes discrimination against anyone.
   King, a Fulton County commissioner and son of slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr., said in a speech Tuesday that he
thinks homosexuals have a problem.
   ``Now something may be wrong in the makeup of that individual if
they happen to be that way,'' he told middle-school students in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``Any man that has a desire to be with another
man has a problem, in my opinion. And that applies to any woman who
has a desire to be with another woman.''
   The New York-based Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation
called King's remarks ``strange and upsetting,'' and on Wednesday
the Atlanta Gay Center requested a meeting with King to discuss the
remarks.
   In a statement issued by his office Wednesday, King said he
understands the obstacles that discrimination poses for all
minorities.
   ``I can state without any reservation that I am totally
committed to protecting the rights of members of the gay
community,'' King said.
   ``Further, I must emphasize strongly and emphatically that I
oppose any form of discrimination against gays and that I will
continue to seek non-violent ways of protecting all men, women and
children from any and all forms of discrimination.''

   As a French cardinal dabbed ashes on his forehead,
Pope John Paul II on Wednesday marked the start of Lent, the Roman
Catholic church's solemn period of reflection and penance before
Easter.
   Wearing a purple velvet chasuble and a gold miter, the pope
knelt down before Cardinal Gabriel-Marie Garrone to receive the
symbol of Lent during an Ash Wednesday service in a 5th-century
church on Rome's Aventine Hill. The pope led a procession from a
Benedictine monastery to St. Sabina's church for the ceremony.
   In remarks to the service, the pope lamented that modern man
``seems to have barricaded himself against the Lenten call of the
church'' because ``our civilization _ technical, audio-visual and
self-centered'' blocks access to the truth.
   The Lenten's period most solemn day occurs on Good Friday, to
commemorate Jesus' crucifixion. This year it occurs on April 13,
followed two days later by Easter, the church's most joyous
celebration.

<HEAD>Rate Commission Members Want Final Say on Stamp Prices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Postal Rate Commission urged on
Wednesday that they be given the final say on how much it costs to
mail a letter.
   Commissioner W.H. Trey LeBlanc told the House Post Office
Committee that it is ``more important now than ever before'' that
the commission have ``final responsibility for rates.''
   The U.S. Postal Service is expected to announce next week that
it wants to increase rates in 1991, probably to 30 cents for a
first class stamp.
   Under current procedures, the independent rate commission will
then have 10 months to review the proposed rates and to make a
recommendation back to the Postal Service.
   Usually, the commission's recommendation becomes final. But the
board of governors of the Postal Service can overrule it, if the
governors vote unanimously to do so. That has only happened once.
   ``Someone has got to be accountable for what is happening,''
commented LeBlanc in urging the transfer of final rate-making power.
   ``I'm definitely incined toward having the final rate power in
the Postal Rate Commission. I would strongly support that,'' added
the newly installed commission chairman, George W. Haley.
   Commissioner John W. Crutcher told reporters after the hearing
that he agreed with LeBlanc.
   Commissioner Patti Birge Tyson commented that she would like to
see a system in which, if the postal board of governors disagreed
with the commission, it resubmitted the proposal, rather than
voting to overrule.
   The fifth commission member, Vice Chairman Henry W. Folsom, said
that he is ``not too hung up'' on where final authority rests,
noting that the commission nearly has that now, since it takes a
unanimous vote of the nine postal governors to overrule them.
   With a new rate case expected shortly, LeBlanc also urged
Congress to expand the powers of the commission to subpoena
information, if necessary, for its deliberations.
   The members of the rate commission appeared at one of a series
of congressional hearings on postal ooperations. Other hearings
will include officials of the Postal Service.

<TEXT>
   A private health group asked the Food and Drug
Administration on Wednesday to strengthen the wording of warning
labels on oral contraceptives.
   The Public Citizen Health Research Group said its review of 13
studies published since 1977 shows that women under 45 who use
birth control pills for many years may be at increased risk of
developing breast cancer.
   An FDA advisory committee, in January 1989, recommended no
changes in use of the pill, saying research on a possible link to
breast cancer was inconclusive and more study was needed.
   More than 13 million women in the United States between the ages
of 15 and 44 use oral contraceptives.
   Fourteen studies published in the past decade found no link
between the pill and breast cancer, but few of these examined women
who began using the pill at a young age and continued for many
years, the group said.
   Of the 13 studies reviewed, three show that the risk of early
breast cancer appears to increase for these women, said Dr. Sidney
Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group, founded by consumer
advocate Ralph Nader.
   Wolfe said the current labeling system for oral contraceptives
is ``inadequate, years out of date and misleading.''
   The group, however, cautions women against stopping the pill or
switching to a less effective method of birth control. Rather, the
group urges women who are concerned to discuss the research with
their doctor.

<TEXT>
   A consumer group said Wednesday that train
accidents involving hazardous materials jumped 32 percent in a
year, but government regulators and the rail industry said safety
has improved.
   Testifying before a congressional subcommittee, Citizen Action
released a report saying that one in seven rail accidents now
involves toxic materials and toxic accidents on major rail lines
jumped 75 percent in 1988, the most recent year for which complete
data is available.
   Both Federal Railroad Administration and American Association of
Railroads officials said the non-profit group used selective data
to support its conclusions.
   They told the Government Operations transportation subcommittee
that train accidents in which hazardous materials were actually
released have fallen sharply since the mid-1970s and fell from 50
in 1987 to 44 in 1988 and rose to 53 in 1989.
   Citizen Action, which claims 1.8 million members and has taken
stands against insurance industry overcharging and in favor of a
national health care program, said Federal Railroad Administration
figures show 361 accidents involving hazardous materials in 1987
and an increase to 475 in 1988. The group gave no number for 1989.
   All of the figures come Transportation Department reports. The
difference is that the advocacy group includes all accidents
involving a train carrying toxic materials and the FRA and AAR
point only to accidents where hazardous materials were released.
   ``The study makes clear that toxic rail shipments are a growing
danger to the public,'' said John Cameron of Citizen Action. The
study was conducted for Citizen Action by Illinois Public Action,
which found that Illinois led the nation in the number of toxic
rail accidents in 1988.
   ``We have achieved considerable improvement in railroad safety
during the past 12 years,'' said Gregory B. McBride, FRA chief
counsel for safety, adding that he thought it has been ``dramatic''
improvement.
   McBride accused Citizen Action of ``a significantly misleading
use of the statistics.'' He said the group was trying to reach a
predetermined result with ``vague and not constructive'' findings.
   William H. Dempsey, president of AAR, which represents the rail
industry, said there have been ``dramatic improvements in the safe
transportation of hazardous materials.''
   But Dempsey acknowledged that railroads ``run the risk of having
fairly catastrophic accidents, and that is the incentive we have to
improve safety.''
   Between 1979 and 1988, Dempsey said, fatalities in train
accidents went down 16 percent, lost work time due to accidents
declined 66 percent and train accidents dropped 69 percent.

<HEAD>GAO Finds Lax Regulation of Free-Standing Health Centers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing numbers of Americans are getting their
medical care at walk-in clinics and other free-standing centers
that are inadequately regulated to ensure quality care, a
congressional report said Wednesday.
   The General Accounting Office said states don't license or
regulate most types of free-standing medical facilities, and they
impose few penalties when problems are uncovered at licensed
centers.
   The report was released by Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., who
said the lack of oversight ``permits abuses in patient care to
occur with increasing frequency.''
   ``When Americans walk into unlicensed facilities, they walk in
with blindfolds _ unaware of the competence of the provider or of
the quality of care they will receive,'' said Roybal, who chairs
the House Select Committee on Aging and its subcommittee on health
and long-term care.
   The GAO report had been requested by Roybal's predecessor as
subcommittee chairman, the late Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla.
   It covers free-standing facilities such as walk-in health
clinics, 24-hour emergency centers, mental health centers, cancer
treatment facilities, cardiac catheterization laboratories,
surgical centers, and alcohol and drug abuse treatment facilities.
   ``States have been slow to license free-standing providers;
further, they have limited plans to expand licensing
requirements,'' the GAO said. ``No one else currently fills the
gaps. Consumers, therefore, do not have adequate assurance that
unlicensed free-standing providers are giving quality care.''
   Free-standing medical clinics and health maintenance
organizations have expanded rapidly in recent years as a result of
efforts to control health care costs, developing technology and
increased competition, the GAO said.
   Roybal noted that before cost-control rules were imposed on
hospitals in the early 1980s, 95 percent of cataract surgeries were
performed in hospitals. He said 95 percent of the operations now
are performed outside of hopsitals to avoid those cost controls.
   A study prepared for the National Conference of State
Legislatures estimated that up to 40 percent of diagnostic
procedures and surgeries are being done outside hospitals.
   Among the findings in the GAO report:
   _Only Montana and New York require licenses for all the types of
health-care centers operating in their states.
   _No state licenses or otherwise regulates cancer treatment
centers or pain control centers, although such centers are
operating in 14-18 states.
   _Only Virginia and California license cardiac catheterization
laboratories, although the procedure sometimes can involve
complications that result in death, stroke, heart attack or
uncontrolled hemorrhaging.
   _Less than half the states require licenses for independent
clinical laboratories, walk-in clinics or out-patient psychiatric
centers.
   _States frequently did not know what types and numbers of
free-standing clinics were operating within their borders.
   The GAO found that even those centers that are licensed by the
states are subject to few sanctions. In fiscal 1987, for example,
23,000 free-standing health facilities were licensed by the states,
of which 165 were cited for deficiences and 28 had their licenses
suspended or revoked.
   Officials in 36 states expressed concerns about the adequacy of
their oversight of free-standing centers, but most had no plans to
regulate more facilities, the GAO said.

   Space shuttle fans must
wait until April to watch an orbiter land, but officials are
reviewing the policy that will keep Atlantis' arrival closed to
public viewing, NASA said Wednesday.
   Discussions on ending the secrecy policy are being held between
officials of the Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said space agency spokeswoman Nancy Lovato.
   Atlantis blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla., early Wednesday
on a much-delayed mission, reportedly to put a $500 million spy
satellite in orbit. The flight is expected to last about four days
and 10 hours, so the shuttle should land at this Mojave Desert
military base Sunday morning.
   The unpaved public viewing site on the east shore of Rogers Dry
Lake at this high-desert base has been jammed with up to 500,000
spectators during non-military shuttle landings. But, as is the
case on all classified shuttle missions, it will be closed when
Atlantis returns to Earth.
   ``We're sorry it's closed, but of course we're due to have
another (non-classified) landing coming up in April, so people are
invited and welcome to attend the April landing,'' Lovato said.
   The shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch April 12 on a
five-day mission to put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit, NASA
spokesman Don Haley said.
   The no-spectator policy for military shuttle landings has been
under review for some time, Lovato said, adding that she believes a
decision is likely before the next Defense Department flight,
scheduled for July.
   The rationale for the spectator ban isn't clear, since news
reporters and photographers have been allowed to watch and
photograph military shuttle landings, and they have done so from a
site closer to the runway than the public viewing site.
   Those landings also have been televised, and the shuttle
landings are visible from sections of state Highway 58 north of
Edwards Air Force Base.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Drop Slightly in February, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers got for raw products declined
0.6 percent from January to February, but overall commodity index
still averaged 2.7 percent more than a year ago, the Agriculture
Department said Wednesday.
   Lower prices for milk, eggs, lettuce and wheat were mostly
responsible for the decline from January, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   However, the report said higher prices for cattle, broiler and
tomatoes partly offset the decline for the other commodities during
the month.
   ``Tomato prices for February were at the highest level of
records,'' the report said. ``During the past two months prices
have been about twice the previous record established in March of
1985.''
   The price climb was due to short supplies caused by the December
freeze in Florida in December, the report said.
   On the other hand, the report said the drop in milk prices paid
to farmers _ which had been at record levels _ was largest
month-to-month decline ever recorded. And the egg price drop was
said to be the third-largest on record.
   The report did not include new figures on farm expenses. Those
are computed every three months. In January, however, new quarterly
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 1.1 percent from
October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9 percent more than a
year earlier.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $44 billion to $49
billion, compared with $48 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA economists to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told Congress on Wednesday
that farm commodity prices are expected to be ``relatively
favorable'' in 1990 because of strong demand and declining
inventories of most crops. He said feed grains and soybeans may be
exceptions, however.
   ``Production may rise as acreage reduction requirements for
wheat, cotton and rice are lessened, bringing more acreage into
production,'' he told a Senate Appropriation subcommittee.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the February price index for
livestock and poultry was down 0.6 percent from January but was up
8.2 percent from February 1989.
   Milk prices dropped 80 cents from January to $14.90 per 100
pounds but were still $1.80 more than a year ago.
   Crop prices, overall, dropped 0.7 percent from December and were
2.9 percent below the year-earlier average.
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $74.60 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $73.70 in January and $71.60 in February 1989.
Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $48.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $47.30 in
February and $40.40 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.27 a bushel, edged down from $2.31 in January and
was down from $2.59 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.57 per bushel, compared with $3.71 in January and $4.03
a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.29 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.40 in
January and $6.67 in February 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.51 per bushel, down from $5.65 in January and
$7.41 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 61.7 cents per pound, up from
59.8 in January and 52.8 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 70.4 cents per dozen, compared with 83.8 in January
and 62.1 in February 1989.
   _Milk was $14.90 per 100 pounds, down from $15.70 in January but
above the average of $13.10 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 33.5 cents per pound, live weight, up from 30.7
cents in January but down from 38.3 cents a year earlier.

<HEAD>Bush Names Controversial Prosecutor as U.S. Attorney in Florida</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House announced Wednesday that
President Bush will nominate Dexter W. Lehtinen as U.S. attorney
for South Florida, a job he has held on an acting basis for nearly
two years.
   The nomination of the prosecutor, whose tenure has been marked
by controversy, had been in limbo for months, in part because of an
FBI background check.
   Lehtinen, 43, is a battle-scarred Vietnam veteran who graduated
at the top of his class from Stanford Law School in 1975.
   In January, he indicated at first he would be the lead
prosecutor in the drug prosecution of Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
deposed ruler of Panama. He then stepped aside and appointed
members of his office to lead the prosecution team.
   The tough-talking Lehtinen once created a stir by waving what he
later said was a replica AK-47 assault rifle at a meeting with
prosecutors to dramatize the seriousness of the fight against drugs.
   He is a former Florida state representative and senator whose
wife, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, was elected to Congress last year as a
Republican to fill the Miami seat left vacant by the death of Rep.
Claude Pepper.
   Lehtinen worked as a Justice Department assistant attorney in
California in 1975-77 and in Miami on the Miami Organized Crime
Strike Force in 1978-81.
   He began his career in Florida state politics in 1980, then
returned to the U.S. attorney's office in Miami in 1988 after Leon
B. Kellner stepped down.
   The Miami Herald printed excerpts from his FBI background report
in January, including allegations that he had pushed his first wife
down and abused an ex-girlfriend.
   The Herald reported that the White House had decided to hold up
the nomination to see if any further charges surfaced, but that the
president still intended to support Lehtinen barring any new
revelations.
   The post requires Senate confirmation.
   The White House said Bush ``announced his intention to
nominate'' Lehtinen to the job for a four-year term.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said Wednesday he expects to support
Lehtinen's nomination when it reaches the Senate floor. Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla., had expressed reservations, but said Wednesday he
is also inclined to support the nomination.
   Lehtinen and his wife have four children and live in Miami. She
is the first Cuban-American to serve in Congress.

<HEAD>ABC Official Unsure If Andy Rooney Suspension Hurt ``60 Minutes''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although an ABC show beat CBS' ``60 Minutes'' in
ratings Sunday, a senior ABC official said Wednesday it's
simplistic to think the Andy Rooney controversy has caused the CBS
show's recent ratings decline.
   ABC's Alan Wurtzel said he didn't have any research to show ``60
Minutes'' was hurt by CBS' suspension of Rooney from the show after
a gay magazine attributed a racial slur to him. The humorist denies
saying it.
   ``It's very simplistic and one-dimensional to think that any one
event triggers things like that'' ratings decline, said Wurtzel,
ABC's senior vice president for research. ``I think it's a much
more complicated thing.''
   ``60 Minutes'' was 18th in national ratings last week, beaten in
its time period by a rerun of the premiere of ABC's ``America's
Funniest Home Videos.''
   It was the first time in 12 years an entertainment show has
beaten a first-run ``60 Minutes'' broadcast. In a memo to his
staff, Don Hewitt, ``60 Minutes'' executive producer, said he
guessed the Rooney flap had ``played a pretty big part'' in the
ratings results.
   ``60 Minutes'' was in 11th place the previous week, and in 10th
place the week before that. Rooney was suspended without pay for
three months on Feb. 8. CBS says the suspension still is in effect,
despite reports it may end soon.
   Michael Eisenberg, a CBS research vice president, said ABC's
Sunday show drew viewers because ``America's Funniest Home Videos''
is ``a pretty hot show and would do well wherever you put it.''
   He noted that ``60 Minutes'' still is sixth in ratings averages
for the season to date, averaging a 33 per cent share of audience.
It averaged a 20 rating on a scale in which each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes watching a show.
   Wurtzel met with reporters to discuss the February ratings
``sweeps'' period that ended Wednesday. His NBC and CBS
counterparts will hold similar sessions Thursday.
   His figures, lacking just the last two days of ratings for the
period, didn't produce any surprises. NBC continued to lead in
prime time ratings, with a 15.1 average rating for the period,
followed by ABC with a 13.0 and CBS with a 12.6.
   He ducked a question on whether he thought ``60 Minutes'' would
continue to decline in the ratings.
   Noting that the show has been on the air since 1968, he said
it's ``still a strong show. But I don't think I'm surprised to see
that there's been a certain amount of slippage.''
   He cited as factors the cyclical nature of television and
competition against CBS' newsmagazine series from ``an enormous
proliferation of similar types of programs'' in recent months.
   Wurtzel, speaking of the ratings slide of the once-dominant
``CBS Evening News'' and the rise of ABC's ``World News Tonight,''
predicted that the latter's string of ratings victories will
continue.
   ABC's broadcast has won seven consecutive weeks in evening news
ratings. CBS' program has been in third place for five of the last
eight weeks, and tied once with the ``NBC Evening News'' for second
place, CBS estimates show.
   ``In essence, what we see is that CBS and NBC will be fighting
it out for second place position for some time to come,'' Wurtzel
said.

   Heart-conscious eaters can safely add
monounsaturated fats to their low-fat diets, but it probably won't
reduce their cholesterol, a study concludes.
   Researchers who compared blood cholesterol levels in groups of
men after they followed diets with different levels of saturated,
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found that while
monounsaturated fats don't raise cholesterol, they don't lower it
significantly either.
   ``What we hoped to do here was try to straighten out some
misconceptions about `monos' that have arisen ... that they had
some independent effect on lowering cholesterol,'' said Dr. Henry
N. Ginsberg who worked on the study, published in Thursday's New
England Journal of Medicine.

   Getting lots of potassium is no substitute for
taking high blood pressure medicines, according to a report being
published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Researchers studied 287 middle-age men already on medication for
high blood pressure and put half on potassium and half on placebos.
Then their regular blood pressure medicines were withdrawn.
   During the next two years, the men took the potassium or dummy
supplements and followed low-salt diets. About half the people in
both groups had to resume taking blood pressure pills because of
rising blood pressure.
   The researchers said their work suggests that ``potassium
supplementation does not reduce the need for anti-hypertensive
medication of men on a low-sodium diet.''
   The study was suggested by population research that found groups
with high levels of potassium in their diets also tend to have
healthy blood pressures.

   Scientists have created a substance that blocks
infection by viruses that cause colds, a possible step toward drugs
that could prevent or ease up to 45 percent of all colds.
   But one of the study's authors, Steven Marlin, cautioned that it
was done in the test tube, and speculating on its meaning for a
human cold is ``a huge leap.''
   In the study, scientists decoyed cold-causing rhinoviruses into
attaching themselves to a free-floating man-made version of a
molecule that the viruses normally bind to on the surfaces of
healthy cells, thus diverting the viruses from their normal target.
   By this process, researchers found the man-made molecule was
largely able to block rhinovirus infection of human cells in the
test tube.
   The research is presented in Thursday's issue of the British
journal Nature.

   Labels on meat and poultry products will have
to be more specific when certain flavorings are used, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Federal rules are being changed, effective March 1, to require
``proteinaceous material'' derived from livestock, poultry, eggs,
milk, plants and yeast to be listed on labels by their names.
   In the past, such substances could be listed simply as
``flavorings'' or similar terms. For example, a popular ``flavor
agent'' or enhancer used for years in hot dogs will have to be
labeled ``milk protein hydrolyzate.''
   Lester M. Crawford of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service said the new rule was adopted ``to better
protect the public health and serve the consumer's right to know''
what is in food products.

   Electronic fetal monitors routinely used in
hospital delivery rooms aren't any better _ and perhaps riskier _
than ordinary stethoscopes for monitoring the progress of babies
during birth, a study concludes.
   Researchers found signs that cerebral palsy may be more common
among infants whose births are electronically monitored, although
they cautioned that this finding could be a statistical fluke.
   But even if electronic monitoring isn't any worse than the
traditional stethoscope, the study failed to find evidence that it
improves the chances of a healthy birth.
   One researcher noted that, in part, the wide use of electronic
monitors has taught doctors what warning signs they need to listen
for with their stethoscopes.
   The results were published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine.

   A drug used to prevent epileptic seizures can
lose a third of its effectiveness if stored in humid conditions,
according to study results released Wednesday by the Food and Drug
Administration.
   The FDA is asking manufacturers of the epilepsy drug,
carbamazepine, to change their packaging of the drug to keep out
moisture. Users of the drug should keep their supplies tightly
closed in a cool, dry place, away from bathrooms, showers and
humidifiers, the agency said.
   The research found that when carbamazepine tablets were exposed
to humidity, they hardened and dissolved poorly in test liquids.
Blood samples confirmed that carbamazepine tablets that dissolved
poorly also were absorbed poorly by the body and were less
effective.

   Growth in federal financing for AIDS prevention
will slow down because AIDS has to compete for funds with other
health problems and national priorities, the Centers for Disease
Control warns in a new draft report on AIDS in the 1990s.
   ``Program needs can be expected to continue to grow at a pace
that will probably exceed available resources,'' the CDC cautioned.
``We must approach our planning with an awareness of these changes
and a willingness to change.''
   The CDC, in a preliminary draft of its ``Strategic Plan for
Prevention of HIV Infection, 1990 _ and Beyond,'' outlines the
agency's goals and objectives for AIDS.
   Recommendations in the plan, such as proposals for increased
testing, counseling and partner notifications aren't specific
suggestions to state and local health agencies, but rather are ``a
plan, communicating generally to the public,'' said Dr. Gary Noble,
deputy director for AIDS programs.
   After public comment and possible revisions, the CDC report is
scheduled for release in June.

<TEXT>
   Europe's second deadly storm of the year took
three more lives Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 65 in three
days of severe winds that caused destruction from Sweden to Sicily.
   Firefighters controlled brush fires that had been fanned by 70
mph winds on Corsica, the French Mediterranean island southeast of
Nice, but forecasters said winds up to 100 mph could hit again on
Thursday.
   About 800 people were evacuated Tuesday night as fires
approached their villages but most were returning home Wednesday,
Corsican officials said.
   A 50-year-old woman was killed Wednesday in Catania, Sicily,
when wind buffeted her car and sent it crashing into a tree, and a
57-year-old man died in Salonica, Greece, when his car was blown
off the road.
   Altogether, 18 people were reported killed in Britain, 12 each
in West Germany and France, six in Switzerland and Italy, five in
Belgium, three in East Germany, and one each in Ireland, Greece and
the Netherlands.
   In Denmark, a West German father and son were feared dead after
disappearing on a fishing trip.
   The European Community announced about $2 million in emergency
aid for Red Cross associations in seven stricken countries, with
Britain getting the largest share, $600,000.
   Prince Charles cut short his Swiss skiing holiday so that he and
Princess Diana could visit flood-stricken northwestern Wales on
Thursday.
   In the seaside resort of Towyn, 800 villagers fled their homes
when the sea wall broke and were being housed in four temporary
shelters including a factory cafeteria and Bodelwyddan Castle.
   Tractors and large trucks dumped 5-ton boulders during low tide
periods to fill the 2,000-foot gap knocked into the sea wall by
storm waters.
   ``We will be consolidating it and progressively strengthening it
in the future, but for now the main thing is to get something very
solid in place,'' said Colwyn Borough Council chief executive Bill
Breeze.
   The 50,000 residents of Cockermouth and Workington in
northwestern England were warned Wednesday to boil their water
because the storm had knocked out power at a treatment plant.
   High winds knocked out power to thousands in Sweden's
second-largest city, Goteborg.
   In Denmark, an empty ferry sank in her berth, several towns
along the west coast were flooded and fallen trees blocked roads.
   Finnish army recruits and firefighters left the presidential
palace in downtown Helsinki after spending the night piling sand
bags along the sea front only 110 yards away.
   ``The president is in, but there's no danger,'' Deputy Fire
Chief Ake Gronmark said.
   Swiss trains and buses rolled back to a normal schedule after
transportation was halted Tuesday by 167 mph winds, the strongest
on record in that nation, the Swiss weather office said.
   Many alpine villagers were stranded without electricity by rain
and winds that Swiss newspapers headlined ``the storm of the
century.''
   The Swiss government has set up a crisis unit for the forestry
industry. Authorities say the storm knocked down $67 million in
timber, one-quarter of the nation's yearly consumption.
   French fishermen who have been kept in port much of the month by
storms will be eligible for unemployment and other benefits, the
government said.
   In Greece, the Merchant Marine Ministry banned all passenger and
ferry ships from sailing to islands in the Aegean and Ionian seas
because of gale-force winds.
   High-spirited ferry passengers stranded 24 hours in the North
Sea when the dock gate at Teesport was damaged, streamed off the
Norstar Wednesday at the British port after having ``a whale of a
time'' assisted by a full stock of alcohol.
   ``A lot of people enjoyed it,'' passenger John Asher said.
``With a great crowd of 600 on board, 150 of them Liverpudlians,
and plenty of duty-free drink, what else could you expect?''

   Mayor Marion Barry, back in the capital for
the first time in more than a month, pleaded innocent Wednesday to
cocaine possession and perjury charges filed after an investigation
into his ties to a convicted drug dealer.
   ``We will not plea bargain, and the mayor is not considering
resigning,'' Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, said after the
nine-minute court proceeding. ``The mayor is confident he will be
vindicated at trial.''
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson scheduled a
June 4 trial on three counts of perjury and five counts of
misdemeanor possession of cocaine.
   Barry is enrolled in a substance abuse treatment program at the
Fenwick Hall hospital outside Charleston, S.C.. A senior Barry aide
speaking on condition of anonymity said Barry, who returned to
Washington Tuesday, would go back to the center later Wednesday.
   Mundy said the mayor's treatment for alcoholism was ``going
well'' and Barry was in ``good spirits.''
   Barry, 53, did not speak to reporters upon entering or exiting
the courthouse.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens would not comment on the
possibility of a plea bargain, but said that the probe was
continuing ``with respect to a variety of allegations'' involving
Barry and various city services.
   Meanwhile, a top city government source said prosecutors have
delivered subpoenas to ``at least a dozen'' city agencies that have
had dealings with eight of Barry's close friends. The city records
of those Barry associates were subpoenaed last week.
   The new subpoenas have been issued to determine whether there
were any irregularities in any contracts the mayor's friends have
received, sources said.
   Subpoenas were also issued Wednesday for a number of Barry's
telephone records, including the period surrounding Barry's arrest
at a downtown Washington hotel in January, a city government source
said.
   The subpoenas for the mayor's office and car telephone records
include the periods from Jan. 1, 1988, through March, 31, 1988 and
Jan. 1, 1989, through Jan. 23, 1990, the source said.
   Barry was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in an FBI
sting operation at a downtown Washington hotel Jan. 18 and left for
a Florida substance abuse treatment center on Jan. 22.
   All but one of the charges against the mayor stem from an
investigation into Barry's ties to convicted drug dealer Charles
Lewis, who has testified that he supplied the mayor with crack
cocaine in December 1988. One possession charge involved the
mayor's sting operation arrest.
   Barry sat at the defense table reading the indictment prior to
the start of his arraignment and did not speak as Mundy entered the
innocent pleas. Mundy said Barry's wife, Effi, did not attend the
court session on his advice.
   Prior to the mayor's arrival at the courthouse, 18 Guardian
Angels paraded outside, chanting that the mayor should leave office.
   Many carried signs reading ``Mr. Mayor, do the right thing _
resign.'' All were chanting, ``Barry, it's the time, it's time for
you to resign.''
   Reporters and cameramen were ordered by police off the plaza
outside the main entrance to the courthouse amid fears of a repeat
of the melee that resulted from Barry's court appearance on Jan.
19, the day following his arrest.
   If convicted of all charges filed against him, the mayor could
face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1.25 million
fine.

<HEAD>Important Prosecution Witness in Bensonhurst Case Missing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A witness in the alleged killing of a black
teen-ager by a gang of white youths has been missing for two months
and prosecutors will try to delay next week's trial if he is not
located soon, a district attorney said Wednesday.
   The witness, John Vento, 21, an alleged participant in the Aug.
23 attack in the predominantly white Bensonhurst section of
Brooklyn, had agreed to testify before a grand jury and at the
trial, said Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes.
   Under an agreement with the former Brooklyn district attorney,
in exchange for his testimony Vento would not be charged in the
attack, Hynes said.
   He described Vento as ``a very important witness'' but said his
absence was ``not devastating.''
   ``It's important to have Vento in this case,'' Hynes said. ``But
if we don't find him, we're going to proceed.''
   On Monday, when defendants in the case are scheduled to go on
trial, prosecutors will ask state Supreme Court Justice Thaddeus
Owens to postpone the trial for a month, Hynes said. The judge
signed a material witness order on Feb. 14 directing Vento to
appear at the trial.
   If Vento surrenders within the next several weeks, Hynes said he
would abide by the agreement. But if Vento refuses to voluntarily
come forward he could face second-degree murder charges for his
role in the shooting death of 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins, Hynes said.
   ``I do not choose to do that right now because I'm not looking
to make this witness an antagonistic witness. I'm looking to have
him do the right thing and give some justice to this kid,'' Hynes
said at a news conference.
   There was no indication Vento has met with foul play, Hynes said.
   ``I suspect the reason he took off was a fairly uncomplicated
one,'' Hynes said. ``As the trial drew closer, he chickened out.''
   Hawkins was fatally shot when he and three friends, all black,
were surrounded by a gang of young whites shortly after they
arrived in Bensonhurst to look at a used car.
   Six defendants face trial on second-degree murder charges and a
seventh was charged with first-degree assault. All of them except
the alleged trigger man, Joseph Fama, 18, have been released on
bail.
   An attorney for Fama, Stanley Meyer, said he would oppose an
adjournment because the judge earlier denied defense requests for
more time to prepare their cases.
   He said he believed Vento was ``a major component in the case.
Apparently, he's going to say someone put the gun in Fama's hands.''
   Prosecutors learned early in January from Vento's parents that
their son ``had taken off during the Christmas holidays,'' Hynes
said.
   Police and the FBI traced Vento to undisclosed locations upstate
and in Ohio, but prosecutors believe he is now in the New York City
area.
   Vento's lawyer, Gerald Dichiara, said ``I haven't seen him in
months.''
   He said Vento may have fled after it became apparent he would
have to testify against his friends.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Tax Court on Wednesday denied reputed
Chicago mob boss Anthony J. Accardo a tax deduction for $224,500 of
legal fees incurred in winning acquittal on racketeering charges.
   Accardo contended that the fees were deductible on grounds that
he had spent the money to prevent government confiscation of his
income-producing bank accounts.
   The court noted that Accardo ``does not explain why he believes
that none of his legal fees were incurred to conserve and maintain
his other, non-income-producing property ... (condominiums in
Illinois and California) or to keep him out of jail.''
   ``No part of the legal fees is deductible,'' the court held.
``Petitioner's (Accardo's) situation is no different from that of
any defendant in a criminal or civil trial who faces a potential
fine or monetary judgment that must be paid out of income-producing
assets such as savings accounts, certificates of deposit or
stocks.''
   Accardo was acquitted in Miami in 1982 of racketeering charges
alleging a kickback conspiracy in affairs of the Laborers Union.

<TEXT>
   After years in the trenches of America's drug
war, Drug Enforcement Administration chief John C. Lawn is heading
to a new turf: overseeing operations for the New York Yankees
baseball organization.
   ``He will be involved with all operational areas other than
player personnel,'' Yankees spokesman Arthur Richman said Wednesday.
   Lawn, who announced Tuesday that he will retire as DEA chief on
March 23 after 27 years in government service, will become vice
president and chief of operations for the Yankees, he said.
   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner met Lawn in 1987 when the two
were on a speaking panel before the World Business Council, said
DEA spokesman Frank Shults. In addition, Lawn is a close personal
friend of Phil McNiss, a retired FBI agent who is vice president of
Steinbrenner's American Shipbuilding Co., the spokesman said.
   McNiss recommended Lawn ``very highly'' for the job, and was
instrumental in his hiring, said Richman, senior vice president for
the Yankees.
   Lawn's starting date with the Yankees remains uncertain, Richman
said.
   ``Mr. Steinbrenner said he can take all the time necessary to
assist President Bush in seeking and counseling a replacement,'' he
said.
   Richman said Lawn would not be involved in any anti-drug
activities with the Yankees.
   Shults described Lawn as ``very athletic,'' but said there was
no indication he had any particular background in baseball.
   The DEA chief was a basketball coach when he taught English and
American history at the Jesuit-run Brooklyn Preparatory School for
seven years after leaving the Marine Corps and before beginning his
law enforcement career, Shults said. In 1964, Lawn was named New
York City's high school coach of the year, he said.
   Lawn joined the FBI in 1967 and was named DEA acting deputy
administrator in 1982. President Reagan nominated him to the top
DEA job in 1985 to replace Francis M. Mullen, who had retired.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega declared a
halt to attacks on the Contras Wednesday and called again on the
United States to help dismantle the rebel force.
   President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who joined Ortega
on Tuesday in asking the U.S.-backed Contras to put down their
arms, praised his move as a step forward.
   ``The causes of civil war in Nicaragua have disappeared,'' Mrs.
Chamorro told a news conference. ``There is no reason for war.''
   She said the Contras, most of them based in neighboring
Honduras, ``must lay down their weapons and come home to work for
the reconstruction of Nicaragua.''
   Ortega said in a statement that he ordered all offensive
military operations against the Contras to halt. He said the United
States should help pay for demobilizing and relocating the rebels.
   Mrs. Chamorro upset Ortega in an election on Sunday that he
agreed to as part of a Central American plan for ending the war and
which he clearly expected to win.
   Demobilizing the Contras is the trickiest issue in transition
talks that began Tuesday between Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party
coalition, the United National Opposition, and the stunned
Sandinistas, who have been in power for 10{ years.
   Sandinista officials say they cannot give up control of the
armed forces and police, both party organs, as long as the
10,000-man Contra army is intact.
   Mrs. Chamorro made it clear she expects Ortega to keep his
promise to turn over power and that her government plans to run the
army and security forces.
   ``I'm the one who is going to give orders,'' said the
silver-haired widow, who was chosen to run against Ortega because
of her powerful symbolic value.
   The 1978 death of her husband, opposition publisher Pedro
Joaquin Chamorro, touched off the revolution that overthrew
dictator Anastasio Somoza and put the Sandinistas in power.
   She said the Sandinistas ``have to turn over everything,''
including the armed forces _ the traditional source of real power
in Latin America.
   ``The minister of defense will be a civilian,'' she declared.
   The current minister, Gen. Humberto Ortega, the president's
brother, leads the Sandinista transition team. Mrs. Chamorro's
son-in-law and campaign manager, Antonio Lacayo, heads the United
National Opposition team.
   The transition talks are expected to be complex and delicate.
   Ortega laid out tough Sandinista positions on Tuesday before
thousands of cheering party members.
   He demanded demobilization of the Contras and said the party
would ``defend the integrity and the professionalism of the army
and the police forces.''
   Mrs. Chamorro campaigned on a platform that promised an end to
the draft and drastic cuts in the armed forces, which Soviet aid
has built into the most powerul military machine in the region.
   The statement from the Sandinista leadership also challenged
privatization, a major plank in the UNO platform.
   Francisco Mayorga, an economic adviser to Mrs. Chamorro, said
the new government would not return banks to private ownership.
   ``The banks will stay nationalized,'' he said in a brief
interview while waiting for Mrs. Chamorro's news conference to
begin.
   Mayorga said he was going to New York and Washington this week
at the head of an UNO delegation seeking funds to help Nicaragua
rebuild.
   The economy has been savaged by the civil war, a U.S. economic
embargo and poor management.
   The Bush administration, which backed UNO, has said Mrs.
Chamorro's victory means it will lift the embargo.
   Mrs. Chamorro's running mate, Virgilio Godoy, told reporters he
suspects the Sandinistas of trying to alter election returns to
affect the outcome of the National Assembly races.
   But former U.S. Attorney General Elliot Richardson, leader of
the United Nations election monitoring team, said nothing was amiss
with the vote count.
   ``Everything is normal,'' he said by telephone.
   Richardson said final results should be released within days.
   Preliminary results based on returns from 82 percent of the
precincts indicate Mrs. Chamorro took 55.2 percent of the vote to
Ortega's 40.8 percent, with the remainder going to minor party
nominees.
   UNO won 52 seats in the National Assembly while the Sandinistas
got 39, including one awarded to Ortega as a presidential candidate
who got at least 1 percent of the vote, according to preliminary
figures.
   Depending on final returns, Moises Hassan of the Revolutionary
Unity Movement may also qualify for a seat as a losing presidential
candidate, which would mean a 92-member assembly.
   The 240-member U.N. team was one of hundreds of organizations
monitoring Sunday's general elections.

   The Centers for Disease Control is
recommending that AIDS and virtualy all other contagious diseases
be dropped as reasons for preventing foreigners from entering the
United States, a federal health official said Wednesday.
   The CDC's action on AIDS is largely symbolic, however, because
the list still would include infection with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS. That restriction
was imposed by Congress.
   The recommendation by the CDC to remove AIDS is seen as
``signaling Congress that they should take HIV off'' the list as
well, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Along with AIDS, the CDC is recommending removing from the list
all other contagious diseases except infectious tuberculosis, the
source said.
   After a review of the diseases on the list, including syphilis,
gonorrhea and leprosy, the CDC decided that only tuberculosis posed
an important threat because it is highly contagious in its active
stage.
   While AIDS is also contagious, certain behavior _ such as sexual
contact or needle-sharing _ is required to transmit the virus.
   Efforts are underway in Congress to give the administration
complete discretion as to what diseases to put on the list.
However, an aide on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
said ``it's still an open question'' whether an act of Congress is
required.
   The immigration regulations concerning AIDS have been protested
by AIDS activist groups, including the National Commission on AIDS
and the World Health Organization.
   Several groups, including the National Association of People
with AIDS, have said they will boycott two major AIDS conferences
in the United States this year unless the restrictions are changed.
   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health at the
Department of Health and Human Services, asked the CDC to review
the diseases on the immigration-restriction list and recommend
changes. The list had not been reviewed since 1977.
   After consulting with outside medical experts, the CDC
recommended that all but tuberculosis be dropped from the list. If
Mason approves the recommendation, the change would be published in
the Federal Register before taking effect.

<HEAD>Administration Moving Toward Eastern European Trade Agreements</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
Wednesday the administration was moving quickly to negotiate
preferential trade agreements to support the new reform governments
in Eastern Europe.
   But she cautioned that the success of the new governments would
depend on the extent of internal reforms rather than outside
assistance from other Western nations.
   In congressional testimony, Hills said that it was crucial for
the new leaders in Eastern Europe to realize that ``minimal
measures to reform a command economy simply will not work. Real
substantive change is the best hope.''
   She said each formerly communist government needed to institute
market-oriented reforms emphasizing private ownership and
decentralized economic decision-making along with providing
adequate protections for foreign investors.
   ``The degree and the speed of economic reform in these centrally
planned economies will be the determining factor in whether their
economies develop and their products are able to become competitive
in world markets,'' she told members of the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   The administration has already begun funneling economic
assistance to Poland and Hungary while making plans to provide help
for other Eastern European nations as well.
   Hills said the administration was in various stages of the
negotiating process to enact new trade treaties granting the
countries most favored nation status, which qualifies them for the
lowest tariffs granted to any nation with which America trades.
   Poland and Hungary have already been granted the most favored
nation designation and the administration two weeks ago launched
negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at awarding the Soviets
similar status.
   Hills said the second round of the Soviet trade talks would be
held in London on Thursday and Friday. A third session is scheduled
for later in March and Hills repeated the administration's goal of
having a treaty ready for signing at the next summit meeting
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in
June.
   Granting the Soviets the lower tariffs hinges on final approval
by the Soviet parliament of a liberalized emigration law.
   Several members of the committee questioned Hills about the
refusal of the Soviets to allow direct commercial airline flights
from the Soviet Union to Israel, saying American trade negotiators
should push for these flights in order to facilitate Jewish
emigration from the country.
   Hills said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III had raised
this issue with the Soviets but that the administration did not
want the trade normalization effort to hinge on the airline issue.

   Democrats prevailed Wednesday in the year's
first congressional battle over the so-called peace dividend,
pushing language through the Senate recommending that defense
budget savings be used to slash the federal deficit.
   In the second of a pair of votes, a Republican alternative
urging the use of the moneys to cut taxes was defeated by majority
Democrats.
   The fight was over a competing pair of non-binding resolutions
and was therefore largely symbolic. Nonetheless, it provided a
preview of a partisan dispute likely to reverberate through
Congress for years: What to do with billions of dollars in planned
military spending that have been made unnecessary by easing
East-West tensions.
   The Senate voted 79-19 for language by liberal Democrats, led by
Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and James Sasser, D-Tenn., urging
the Senate to use defense savings mainly to help balance the
federal budget. As lesser priorities, they said the savings should
also be used to address ``urgent national priorities'' such as
anti-drug and education efforts, and to cut taxes ``for working men
and women.''
   Minutes later, senators voted 50-48 against a rival proposal
from 12 GOP conservatives, led by Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas,
recommending that money siphoned from the Pentagon's budget ``be
returned to America's taxpayers.'' The Republicans said that would
include tax deductions for child care, a capital gains tax rate
cut, a lowering of other tax rates and additional ideas.
   Democrats argued that the large tax cuts of 1981 did not improve
the nation's economy and that the country has too many unaddressed
problems.
   ``It's high time we quit squandering the treasury of this nation
for overly sophisticated weapons systems,'' Sasser said. ``We need
to take this peace dividend, and we need to apply these funds
wisely.''
   Republicans countered that in the years following the Vietnam
War, moneys taken from the Pentagon budget were spent fruitlessly
by Congress, a scenario that should be avoided.
   The term ``peace dividend,'' while widely used, can be
misleading. Technically, with the government running large deficits
each year, reductions in the Pentagon's budget will not leave the
government with surplus dollars to spend. The Congressional Budget
Office expects the deficit in fiscal 1991 _ which begins Oct. 1 _
to be $138 billion.
   Nonetheless, since the Warsaw Pact began deteriorating late last
year, lawmakers have been arguing over what to do with the money
that everyone had assumed would be used for defense spending.
   In his budget for the fiscal year that will begin Oct. 1,
President Bush proposed Pentagon spending of $292.1 billion. That
is $5.3 billion more than is being spent this year but $3.9 billion
below the amount that would have been needed to keep pace with
inflation.
   Most Democrats and some Republicans have said Bush's request is
too high, and most lawmakers expect Congress to approve a figure
that is several billion dollars lower.
   The resolutions were offered as amendments to a bill that would
allow the government to spend $125 million to set up programs for
volunteers.
   In the 79-19 vote by which the Senate adopted the Democratic
peace dividend resolution, those voting no were:
   Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; John Danforth,
R-Mo.; Bob Dole, R-Kan.; Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.; Jake Garn,
R-Utah; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Jesse Helms, R-N.C.; Gordon
Humphrey, R-N.H.; James Jeffords, R-Vt.; Nancy Landon Kassebaum;
R-Kan.; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska; William
Roth, D-Del.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska; Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., and John Warner, R-Va.
   Not voting were Pete Wilson, R-Calif., and Spark Matsunaga,
D-Hawaii.

   A storm moving out of the southern Rockies spread heavy rain and
snow over parts of the south-central section of the nation
Wednesday.
   The heaviest overnight accumulation was in southeastern
Colorado, where 12 inches fell at Lamar, 8 inches fell in Walsh and
7 inches fell at Holly.
   Light snow fell across all of eastern Colorado and much of
Kansas, and spread into western Nebraska and western Oklahoma.
   By afternoon, mostly showers extended over much of Oklahoma, the
eastern half of Texas and western Arkansas. Light rain and snow
fell over southeastern Kansas and southwestern Missouri.
   Earlier precipitation was heavier. During the 24-hour period up
to 6 a.m. CST, 2.76 inches fell at Dyess Air Force Base at Abilene,
Texas, with 2.39 inches at Fort Sill, Okla., and 2.2 inches at
Wichita Falls, Texas.
   Oklahoma City received 1.21 inches of rain overnight, pushing
their total for the month to a record 4.49 inches as of noon. The
previous February record was 4.05 inches, set in 1987.
   The total for the month at Wichita Falls was 4.55 inches, the
highest February total since 1903.
   Cloud cover and blustery northerly wind kept temperatures in
Oklahoma and western Texas only in the 30s and 40s during the
afternoon. On the northern Plains, that same temperature range was
considered a warming trend, thanks to sunshine and southwesterly
wind.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 9 below zero at

   A bombing campaign blamed on Basque
separatists terrorized Madrid on Wednesday as a parcel blew up at
the main post office and an explosive sent to a government
prosecutor was discovered.
   Police said two postal workers were injured, one seriously, in
the post office explosion. The second bomb was defused before it
went off, police said.
   On Tuesday, the president of the national court, which tries all
terrorism cases, was seriously injured when a package delivered to
his Madrid home blew up as he opened it. Another package bomb
delivered Tuesday to a retired army officer in Valencia was
discovered and detonated by bomb experts without causing injuries.
   The explosions destroyed hopes of renewed talks between the
government and the Basque separatist group ETA, which police
suspect is behind the attacks. ETA, which in Basque language stands
for Homeland and Liberty, seeks autonomy for the three-province
Basque region of northern Spain.
   The post office blast occurred in the first-floor sorting room
where Maria del Pilar was working. Doctors at Gregorio Maranon
hospital said she was in serious condition and had lost a finger,
suffered burns on her neck and face, and sustained injuries to both
eyes.
   Another postal worker was deafened in one ear, doctors said.
   Later, a letter bomb was defused in a Madrid police laboratory
after it was discovered by a bodyguard of prosecutor Eduardo
Fungairino, a police official said.
   Fungairino investigated ETA's bloodiest action, a June 1987 car
bombing that killed 21 people in the parking garage of a Barcelona
department store.
   Judge Fernando de Mateo Lage of the national court, or Audiencia
Nacional, underwent surgery following Tuesday's blast. Mateo Lage,
60, lost both his hands, had severe lung complications and was in
danger of losing his sight, doctors said.
   Although no group claimed responsibility for the attacks, police
have blamed ETA, which has used package bombs in the past. In
September, ETA gunmen ambushed and killed anti-terrorist prosecutor
Carmen Tagle, who worked at the national court.
   ``It is obvious that ETA is still mounting attacks against
society and while there are attacks, there will be no changes in
anti-terrorist policy,'' Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said
Tuesday.
   The package bomb that injured Mateo Lage was mailed Friday, the
same day Corcuera said the government would respond favorably if
the Basque group halted attacks for six months.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
since it began its independence campaign 21 years ago.
   Also on Wednesday, nine soldiers were slightly injured in an
explosion of gun powder in a storage area in the Spanish enclave of
Melilla on the north coast of Morocco, most of them cut by glass,
sources for the Military Hospital there said.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known but a fire
was believed the reason.
   Other military sources said the blast damaged a television relay
and telephone lines.
   The sources demanded anonymity.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranking Republican on the House Armed
Services Committee is warning President Bush that without a
concerted effort for his fiscal 1991 defense budget, administration
priorities will be undermined.
   ``Your supporters on Capitol Hill will obviously do everything
possible to defend your priorities, but our chances of success are
dismal without your aggressive, hands-on participation,'' Rep.
William Dickinson, R-Ala., said in a three-page letter to Bush
dated Monday.
   Dickinson said that for the past two years, Congress and the
White House have reached an agreement on a total for defense
spending, but the chances for such an agreement this year ``are not
promising at this point in time.''
   In addition, several Democratic lawmakers are suggesting cuts of
$10 billion to $12 billion in the Bush administration's proposed
defense budget of $292 billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Dickinson noted that even if Congress cancels the major
strategic modernization programs such as the B-2 stealth bomber,
the two land-based nuclear missiles and the Trident submarine as
well as the Advanced Tactical Fighter and the C-17 transport plane,
the savings won't add up to the amount many members are seeking.
   The cuts, instead, would have to come from personnel and
readiness, ``the very essence of the U.S. military,'' Dickinson
said.
   Dickinson predicted that Congress, facing a diminishing Soviet
threat to the West and an increasing budget deficit, will provide
funds for only one of the two land-based, nuclear missiles the
administration wants.
   The congressman said that without the president's leadership,
``I fear the national security policies and priorities that you and
I both support will be compromised by an unfocused Congress hoping
to reduce defense spending and demanding to micro-manage whatever
is left.''

   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel
visited on Wednesday the site of the Auschwitz death camp, where
millions of Jews died at the hands of their Nazi captors.
   ``You cannot travel to any country of Eastern Europe _ and
certainly not to Poland _ without pondering the tragic fate of the
Jewish nation during the last war,'' Arens said in an interview
with the government daily Rzeczpospolita Wednesday. He was visiting
Poland to renew full diplomatic ties.
   ``While being here, our delegation wants to go to all those
places where Jews have been killed.''
   Arens credited Poland with giving Jews ``great assistance''
during World War II, when an estimated 3 million of 3.5 million
Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Millions of other Jews were
brought from across Europe to their deaths at camps in Poland.
   The Auschwitz complex and the adjacent Birkenau camp, an
integral part of German dictator Adolf Hitler's ``Final Solution,''
were built to exterminate Jews, and then Poles and other Slavs.
   Estimates of the death toll at the camp in southern Poland range
from 2.5 million to 4 million, the vast majority Jews.
   A Roman Catholic convent at the edge of the camp has strained
Jewish-Polish relations and stirred international controversy.
   Arens discussed the convent with Polish officials Tuesday. The
government underlined its support for building an alternate home
for the nuns. Ground was broken last week for an interfaith prayer
center, which will include a new convent.
   Arens visited the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in
southestern Poland on Monday at the start of his four-day visit.
   On Tuesday, Arens and Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski signed an accord establishing full diplomatic
relations after a 23-year break.
   Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country after Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to renew relations with Israel in the past six
months.
   Poland, like the entire Soviet bloc except Romania, cut off
relations in 1967 to support the Arab side in a Middle East war
that year.

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie on
Wednesday criticized the Bush administration's policy on Cambodia,
saying it could lead to ``a return of tragedy'' in the nation.
   Muskie also said the United States should grant diplomatic
recognition to Vietnam, which he said is more interested these days
in economic development that military expansion.
   The former Democratic senator from Maine told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that he is perplexed by U.S. policy on
Cambodia, where efforts are under way to find a new government.
   Muskie recently toured Cambodia under the auspices of the Center
for National Policy, a non-partisan research group.
   ``From the conversations I had and from my own observations, I
have concluded that a fundamental redirection of U.S. policy must
take place, if we are not to contribute to a return of tragedy in
this nation,'' he said.
   Specifically, Muskie objected to allowing the Khmer Rouge any
kind of political role in the country prior to national elections
there.
   The Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, a well-armed guerrilla force,
were responsible hundreds of thousands of deaths between 1975 and
1978 when they were ousted by Vietnamese occupation forces.
   ``My view is that I would rather have the Khmer Rouge outside,''
Muskie said.
   The Khmer Rouge and two non-communist guerrilla groups backed by
the United States are battling the Vietnam-installed government of
Premier Hun Sen.
   Vietnam said it withdrew the last of its troops from Cambodia
last fall, but there have been allegations that some soldiers and
advisers have returned to help support government troops.
   The United States and Britain, France, China and the Soviet
Union have advocated a plan _ proposed by Australia _ to have the
United Nations run Cambodia until elections, and to deploy an
international peacekeeping force to ensure security.
   The Khmer Rouge hold Cambodia's seat at the U.N. General
Assembly.
   Muskie said that it ``became clear that the central question for
U.S. policy had to be, simply, this: why should we insist on
dismantling the existing government prior to elections and thereby
risk the return of chaos?''
   But David Lambertson, the deputy assistant secretary of State,
defended the U.S. policy. While the United States is ``unalterably
opposed'' to the ``abhorrent'' Khmer Rouge, he said they were a
``unpleasant reality'' who had to be addressed.
   He said the State Department's is convinced that ``only a
negotiated political settlement with a substantial U.N.
peacekeeping force can provide the assurances which the Cambodian
people and the international community demand.''

   It's no mystery who's been stealing U.S.
flags from graves at Wellsboro Cemetery, but it's doubtful the
thief will be arrested.
   The culprit is a gray squirrel, said Robert Gee, who lives near
the cemetery in this north central Pennsylvania city.
   The problem began last fall when the furry flag-razer swooped
down from its perch in one of the cemetery's many evergreens,
stripped one of the miniature flags from its standard and returned
aloft, the flag trailing behind him.
   So far, the rampaging rodent has taken more than 20 flags and
scattered them randomly among the pine tree's branches, giving the
tree an almost festive appearance.
   Gee can't figure out how to end the squirrely crime wave, but
he's certain the flags will be replaced before Memorial Day.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's top environmental adviser
blamed Massachusetts on Wednesday for getting no Boston Harbor
cleanup money.
   Michael Deland, head of the President's Council on Environmental
Quality, appeared before the House Subcommittee on Fisheries and
Wildlife Conservation to discuss the budget for the fiscal year
beginning in October but was immediately put on the defensive.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, chided
Deland on the harbor issue. Deland's previous job was head of the
regional office of the Environmental Protection Agency in Boston
and a major responsibility was pushing the state to clean up the
harbor.
   ``Explain to me why, if the president truly cares about Boston
Harbor, which I know he does because I saw his presidential
campaign commercials, does he not have a single dime in his budget
to clean it up?'' Studds asked.
   Deland said Massachusetts missed its opportunity to get federal
funds for the cleanup by waiting so long to start the process.
   ``It is not appropriate to give more money to Boston Harbor now
when it had an opportunity years ago to apply for funds,'' Deland
said.

<TEXT>
   NBC Nightly News commentator John
Chancellor erroneously referred to former Gov. George C. Wallace as
``the late governor,'' but that didn't bother Wallace, his
spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``Newsmen have been making mistakes about George Wallace all of
his life,'' said spokesman Elvin Stanton. ``It's something he
brushes off.''
   During Chancellor's commentary Tuesday night, he quoted Wallace
as once saying governors were nothing more than ``ornaments.''
Chancellor then said, ``Well, it's too bad the late governor wasn't
here in Washington this week'' for a national governor's conference.
   NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay said the mistake was corrected
during the 6 p.m. CST feed of the national news. The NBC affiliate
in Montgomery, WSFA-TV, carried a verbal apology from the network
during its local broadcast.
   Stanton said he did not call NBC because he knew enough people
were aware Wallace was still alive.
   Wallace, who lives in Montgomery, has kept a low profile since
leaving office in January 1987 after four four-year terms, partly
because of health problems stemming from a 1972 assassination
attempt.

<HEAD>Debate Opens on Military Role in Social Improvement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study showing that a Vietnam-era program
failed to help low-aptitude soldiers in later civilian life was
disputed in congressional testimony Wednesday, opening a debate on
whether the military can promote social improvement.
   The House Veterans Affairs subcommittee hearing concerned
``Project 100,000,'' under which Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara tried to fight the Vietnam War and the war on poverty in
one action.
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., chairman of the subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, said he wanted to determine whether
Project 100,000 was a legitimate ``Great Society'' social program.
   ``Or was Project 100,000 a calculated, even cynical, means to
satisfy the manpower needs of the armed forces and at the same time
lessen domestic opposition to the war in Vietnam?'' he asked.
   Under the program, the Pentagon lowered the physical and mental
standards for entry into the armed services. In exchange, the new
members of the service were promised remedial education and
training.
   About 300,000 enlisted under that program from 1966 to 1971,
two-thirds in the Army. Fifty-four percent were volunteers.
   Half came from the South. More than 40 percent were members of
minority groups. The average reading ability was at the sixth grade
level.
   Most went to combat or to ``soft skill'' jobs such as food
service, supply, wire communications, motor transport and
automotive repair.
   Flaws in the enlistment test allowed another group of about
300,000, also lacking the traditional qualifications, to enter the
military from 1976 to 1980.
   According to the study, the Project 100,000 veterans wound up
earning $5,000 to $7,000 less per year than their non-veteran
counterparts. Veterans were more likely to be unemployed, less
likely to be married and more likely to have been divorced.
   The low-aptitude veterans who served from 1976 to 1980 were not
found to be better off economically, educationally or socially than
their non-veteran counterparts. There were no significant
differences in unemployment, kinds of jobs held or average income,
the report said.
   But the veterans had less formal education, higher divorce rates
and were more likely to be unhappy with their jobs.
   ``Project 100,000's social promises were not kept,'' social
scientist Janice H. Laurence testified.
   Laurence is a senior scientist with Human Resources Research
Organization, the Alexandria, Va.-based group that conducted the
study for the Defense Department.
   She suggested that two years in the military was not enough time
to counter characteristics acquired over 18 years of growing up.
She noted that 4 percent of the Project 100,000 continued with
military careers, while Evans noted that many were denied
re-enlistment because of subsequent low test scores.
   ``To compensate for the deficits which the underprivileged bring
with them would require more than a little extra training, and
maybe even a complete restructuring of current pedagogical
practices or content,'' she said.
   The results were disputed by researcher William E. Beusse, who
studied Project 100,000 Army veterans in the early 1970s and
reached opposite conclusions.
   Beusse said he used a far stricter sampling methods, producing
more accurate results. He acknowledged that veterans would have
lost seniority and the opportunity to enter a tight job market.
   ``In an age of dramatically reduced threat, the cost of even a
scaled-down peacetime force may be too expensive for `defense' to
be its only product,'' Beusse argued. ``Society may come to demand
that the military assist in addressing other national needs such as
providing large-scale manpower training for low aptitude men and
women. In this area the military has more than proven its
capability to perform.''
   Wayne S. Sellman, head of recruiting policy for the Pentagon,
said he believed the long-term decline in performance by
low-aptitude veterans may have been due to the gradual distancing
from the discipline and highly organized life that the military
provided, point also made by Laurence.
   He said Sellman's study caught veterans fresh from the service
while Laurence caught them later.

<TEXT>
   Instead of weaving baskets and making
pottery, teen-agers at a summer camp sponsored in part by rockers
of The Grateful Dead will organize to save the planet.
   For the third year, campers from around the country will gather
under the redwoods in July for a 15-day intensive program designed
to teach leadership and organizing skills to the next generation of
social activists.
   ``Not many people know about it, but there is the beginning of a
worldwide youth movement,'' camp organizer Santokh Khalsa said
Wednesday.
   After early-morning yoga, the youths gather in a circle outside
for seminars led by the likes of Ben Cohen, co-founder of Ben and
Jerry's Ice Cream, who has been a champion of socially responsible
business.
   Another speaker at the camp in Mendocino County north of San
Francisco will be Ram Dass, the former Harvard professor who has
blended Eastern philosophy and spiritualism into a unique
prescription for social action.
   The regimen of vegetarian meals, small support groups and daily
feedback sessions sounds like something out of an earlier era.
   It is.
   The camp is coordinated by a Mill Valley-based group called
Creating Our Future. Established in 1987, the group helps high
school students organize to tackle issues like homelessness,
offshore oil drilling and the preservation of rain forests.
   Khalsa, the organization's co-founder, has been involved in the
peace and environmental movements for three decades. Khalsa said
the goal of Creating Our Future is to provide support and direction
to aspiring social activists and to offer the wisdom of experience.
   In keeping with the group's youth-oriented philosophy, Creating
Our Future's board of directors is composed of eight adults and 16
people under age 25.
   Grateful Dead members Bobby Weir and Jerry Garcia are on the
board of directors and advisory board, respectively. The 1960s
band, which still attracts a die-harde cadre of fans known as Dead
Heads for concerts including such hits as ``Truckin','' plans a
concert to benefit the summer camp.
   Campers learn to coordinate public education campaigns,
fund-raising and letter-writing drives, media contacts and
nonviolent public demonstrations.
   But camp isn't about ``just being active and doing sit-ins,''
according to Yvonne Litaker, a camp veteran and speaking tour
coordinator for Creating Our Future.
   ``What is underneath all this is there's a big youth movement
happening here,'' said Litaker, 20. ``We get letters from all over,
from Kenya and Tokyo, from kids who are yearning to do something.''
   For Litaker, who has worked with the organization for a year and
plans to attend camp again this summer, social activism includes a
vegetarian diet, boycotting products made by companies whose
policies she shuns, and being a conscientious recycler.
   ``I've made my life a statement of how I want the world to be,''
she said, describing her efforts to use only cloth napkins and buy
gasoline only from small, independent stations.
   Camp is an opportunity for young people to meet each other,
learn from veteran social activists of the '60s era and expand the
network of youths who care about changing the world, Litaker said.
   Last year, campers helped produce a manual titled, ``How to
Organize a Rainforest Awareness Week at Your School.''
   The camp has become so popular that organizers have increased
the number of spaces from 30 last year to about 100 this summer.
Tuition and room and board runs $480, and applications are accepted
on a first-come, first-served basis, Litaker said.

   Colleagues of a newspaper director
and a police official met Wednesday to discuss the terms of a duel
over a news article that the official claims falsely accuses him of
smuggling.
   Last Friday, police inspector Saul Claveria from San Jose
province challenged the director of the La Republica newspaper to a
duel over the story, which appeared Jan. 24 in the splashy leftist
tabloid.
   The director, Frederico Fasano, derided the challenge as
``anachronistic and medieval,'' but on Tuesday he agreed. However,
he said would only show up at the duel, not defend himself.
   The article in dispute alleged that two cars involved in
distributing contraband consumer items were registered under
Claveria's name. Claveria insisted the cars had belonged to the
police department but that they were sold months ago. He
acknowledged he had signed papers connecting him to the cars, but
said they were connected to the sale.
   The vehicles apparently belong to a car rental agency.
   Fasano, who lived in exile in Mexico during much of Uruguay's
1973-85 military dictatorship, said the story technically was not
incorrect and refused to retract it. Last Saturday, the Interior
Ministry approved Claveria's request for a duel.
   The developments have received prominent coverage by the
national media.
   Wednesday's meeting of the colleagues, or ``seconds'' of each
man, was required by a 1939 law that regulates dueling in this
South American nation. If it takes place, the duel would be the
first in Uruguay in 18 years.
   If the seconds agree to proceed, they must designate a tribunal
that would arrange a site, witnesses, doctors and other details.
   The outcome of the meeting was not disclosed. By tradition,
neither participant nor his seconds may comment publicly on
developments after the challenge has been issued and accepted.
   Duels have a long history in Uruguay. In one of the most famous,
two-time president Jose Batlle y Ordonez challenged the director of
the newspaper El Pais, Washington Baltran, 70 years ago, also over
a published article. He shot and killed him.
   In 1970, Julio M. Sanguinetti, now Uruguay's president, fought a
saber duel with another member of the fractious Colorado Party,
Sen. Manuel Flores Mora. The latter was grazed on the arm, and the
duel was halted.
   The most recent duel occurred in 1972 when two retired generals
faced off over a political dispute.
   Witnesses said Liber Seregni, leader of the Broad Front
coalition of leftist parties, intentionally aimed high and missed
Juan Ribas, a presidential candidate in 1958 and 1971 from a
splinter group of the Colorado Party.
   Ribas, however, took careful aim and fired, and his bullet just
missed the head of his rival.

<HEAD>Labor Department Issues New `Training Wage' Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 3.7 million young Americans could
be eligible for the new below-minimum ``training wage'' that takes
effect April 1 along with the first increase in the minimum wage
since 1981, the Labor Department said Wednesday.
   But few employers will develop training programs that will
permit them to pay the lower wage beyond the 90-day limit, the
department predicted.
   Only firms that develop on-the-job training programs may pay
workers 16 to 19 the lower wage for a second 90-day period.
   Starting April 1, employers can pay teen-agers new to the job
market $3.35 an hour. That's the same amount as the current minimum
wage, which will increase to $3.80 an hour. On April 1, 1991, the
regular minimum wage will go to $4.25 an hour while the training
wage will rise to $3.61.
   Guidelines announced by the department Wednesday require
employers who want to pay the lower wage for the second 90-day
period to develop training programs that provide ``knowledge and
skills beyond those customarily learned by observation and
incidental work exposure.''
   The programs must include training for both ``job-specific
skills,'' such as cleaning equipment or running a cash register,
and personal skills such as courtesy and punctuality, the
guidelines said.
   When Congress debated the measure last year, Democrats opposed a
training wage but were forced to concede the point to President
Bush to avoid a veto. Democrats also had to scale back their final
minimum-wage target, since Bush had vetoed a measure earlier that
called for an increase to $4.55 an hour.
   In return, Bush agreed to have the minimum wage reach $4.25 nine
months earlier than he had proposed and also accepted a far more
restricted training wage than he sought earlier.
   Originally, Bush had wanted to allow the lower wage to be paid
to all workers, regardless of age, for their first six months on
any new job, regardless of past work experience.

   Nearly five years after Terry Anderson was taken
hostage in Lebanon, his sister said Wednesday she believes the
United States, Iran and Syria are moving on a common track toward
freedom for all 18 Western captives.
   ``I'm just going to pray and hold my breath that nothing
disastrous occurs before this can reach fruition,'' said Peggy Say,
winding up a 2{-week trip to Europe and the Middle East that she
called a ``humanitarian pilgrimage.''
   ``My personal sense is, not tomorrow, not next week, maybe not
next month, but certainly soon,'' she said.
   Anderson, 42, s the chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press. He was kidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Mrs. Say's journey with an Associated Press delegation included
meetings with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, Pope
John Paul II, Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and two Syrian ministers.
   She said she felt optimistic that the hostages will be freed.
   ``I think that with my reassurances that the American
administration is doing everything it can do, that the Syrians are
certainly pledged 100 percent with their commitment to resolve it,
and with the statements coming out of Tehran, to say nothing of the
mood in the world today, it just gives me a feeling of hope,'' she
said.
   But in Washington, John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, said he was not optimistic
the hostages would be released soon.
   ``I think the chances are very slim,'' he told members of the
House subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East. While he said he
hopes reports of possible movement are accurate, the relatives of
the hostages have been disappointed in the past.
   ``They get their hopes up and then get them dashed,'' he said.
   Mrs. Say spoke at a news conference after meeting Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie, whose personal envoy Terry Waite was
kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to negotiate the
release of Western hostages.
   Mrs. Say recalled that at her first meeting with Runcie and
Waite, there was a mood of optimism that Waite's mission would be
successful.
   ``I must admit that I feel some responsibility and was just
devastated when Terry Waite was kidnapped,'' she said. ``I hope
when all the hostages come out, certainly I hope Terry Waite is
with them.''
   Eve Keatley, a spokeswoman for the archbishop, said Runcie ``was
very pleased to hear of Peggy's growing optimism after her trip.''
   Mrs. Say concluded her trip at a private dinner with the
families of Waite and other British hostages, and Scottish
relatives of American hostage Thomas Sutherland. The hostages
missing in Lebanon include eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   She said this trip, her fourth to the Middle East, was the first
that didn't leave her feeling ``extremely depressed and thinking
this situation only gets more and more complicated.''
   After meetings in Syria with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
and Information Minister Mohammed Salman, she said, ``I have no
doubts about Syria's commitment. Certainly, if anyone wants it over
with more than the United States, it's certainly Syria.''
   She said she found it ``very, very encouraging'' that Syrian
television carried a lengthy interview with her, in which she said
relations with the United States would not improve until the
hostages are freed.
   She was heartened by a commentary last week in the Tehran Times,
which usually reflects the thinking of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani, that the hostages should be freed. On Sunday, Iran's
Chief Justice Mohammad Yazdi said that Islam opposes hostage-taking.
   Another positive sign, she said, was an appeal Friday by Sheik
Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the most influential Shiite Moslem
leader in Lebanon, for a new approach to freeing the hostages.
Fadlallah is the spiritual guide to the Iranian-aligned Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which is believed to be an umbrella organization
for most of the hostage-takers.
   ``Everywhere I went I was assured that the Americans are doing
the very best they can,'' she added.
   ``I back my administration for the first time in a long, long
time in their stance which is, number one, that the hostages be
released before there is any move towards reconciliation or any
economic contact with Iran and, secondly, that they are not going
to pay ransom,'' Mrs. Say said.
   ``I feel certain that there is going to be nothing shameful
about the deal that is going to be made ... to release these
hostages. Nobody's going to be caught at anything. We suffered our
Iran-Contra, thank you very much. It devastated us,'' she said.
   ``I did my part, and now if everybody does their part we can all
wrap our arms around the hostages and go home,'' she said.
   Mrs. Say has been accompanied on her trip by Larry Heinzerling,
deputy director of World Services for the AP, which supports her
efforts financially and logistically while pressing its own efforts
for Anderson's freedom.
   The leading Arab newspaper Al-Hayat, published in London,
reported Tuesday there had been progress in discussions between the
United States, Iran and Syria aimed at freeing the hostages. The
Lebanese newspaper said the high-level contacts were taking place
in Geneva between U.S. and Iranian officials.
   The newspaper quoted Algerian sources as saying that contacts
were in place through non-diplomatic organizations and that Algeria
was helping in the process.
   The Algerian government refused Wednesday to disclose what steps
it might be taking.
   Kelly denied reports that the United States was involved in
negotiations, although he said the issue has come up once or twice
when Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser, met with
Iranians in The Hague, where a international tribunal is tryin to
resolve financial disputes.
   But Kelly said Sofaer simply reiterates the U.S. position on the
hostages. He is ``not, repeat not, negotiating in The Hague with
the Iranians,'' Kelly said.
   As for the Syrians, Sofaer said, ``I believe they could be more
helpful.'' ``I don't believe the Syrians are being an obstacle in
any way.''

<HEAD>Bulgarian Agrarians Unite, Forming Strong Opposition Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agrarian party officials said Wednesday
their group will merge with a rival party, in a move expected to
make them the favorites over the Communists in Bulgaria's first
free elections in more than 42 years.
   Alexander Petriny, chairman of a joint contact group of the two
rivals, told reporters the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union and
the Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union-Nikola Petkov agreed to join
forces.
   With 150,000 registered members and a strong rural voice, the
united Bulgarian Agrarian People's Union was expected to displace
the Communist Party from its role as favorite in elections planned
for July.
   The two parties began discussing fusion shortly after hard-line
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov was toppled in November, but
differences at times appeared unbridgeable.
   The Agrarian party became a loyal junior partner of the
Communists following the Communist takeover in December 1947, but
began reasserting its independence after democratic reforms started
late last year.
   The Nikola Petkov group _ named after an executed party founder
_ is one of more than a dozen opposition parties newly formed or
reactivated in the new climate of relative permissiveness.
   It had criticized its rival's support of the Communists and had
made fusion conditional on a change in Agrarian party leadership,
some of whom continue to hold high office to which they were
appointed under Zhivkov. Agrarian party leader Angel Dimitrov, for
instance, remains vice president of the State Council, the supreme
body of state power.
   Petriny said the party had formally dissociated itself from the
Communists, but he could not specify what the Agrarian-Communist
relations were to the umbrella Union of Democratic Forces, of which
the Nikola Petkov organization is a member.
   Other officials said the two rivals agreed to formation of a
provisional leadership of a united party, pending a special
Unification Congress, tenatively scheduled for March 24.
   Delegates at an Agrarian party congress Wednesday overwhelmingly
approved a resolution to end participation in the Patriotic Front,
to further distance themselves from the Communists. The Front is a
mass organization set up by the Communists and made up of groups
supporting them.

   The government agreed on Wednesday to let
Operation Lifeline Sudan resume food deliveries to south Sudan in
April, Relief Minister Peter Orat said.
   He said he and U.N. Undersecretary-General Farah Abdul-Rahim
reached agreement at a meeting in this capital city.
   Preparations for holding a donors conference in Khartoum were
also discussed, Orat said, without elaboration.
   Abdul-Rahim was in Khartoum to convey U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar's concern over interruption of relief
supplies to southern Sudan.
   He plans to meet military ruler Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir
Thursday before leaving for Ethiopia, presumably to discuss
obstacles blocking relief shipments there.
   Renewed fighting between government forces and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army led to suspension of food flights to
southern Sudan. The government is preventing departure of a relief
train along a route where food shortages are severe, and the rebels
have been blocking relief efforts.
   Estimates of the number of Sudanese potentially affected by
famine range from 1 million to 3 million.
   Last year, Operation Lifeline Sudan, a U.N.-led campaign to get
food stockpiles in place, averted a repeat of the 1988 famine that
killed 250,000 Sudanese.

   A top State Department official on Wednesday
reiterated the Bush administration's opposition to allowing new
Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union to settle in Israel's
occupied territories.
   The policy statement to Congress came as an Israeli cabinet
official was assuring Secretary of State James A. Baker III that
Israel does not plan to settle Soviet Jewish immigrants in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, sources said.
   The statements to Baker were relayed by sources familiar with
the meeting of the secretary and Yitzhak Peretz, the minister in
charge of resettling immigrants.
   ``We have said repeatedly we don't want to see the expansion of
settlements'' in the West Bank, Asistant Secretary of State John
Kelly told the House subcommittee on Europe and the Middle East.
   Kelly's comments came as Israeli media quoted Yasha Kazakov, an
Israeli official, as saying 230,000 Jews from the Soviet Union
could settle in Israel this year.
   So far, about 9,400 have arrived over the last two months as a
result of more liberalized emigration policies in the Soviet Union
and growing fears of anti-Semitism.
   Arab nations have urged the Kremlin to restrict Jewish
emigration because they fear the new arrivals will be resettled in
the territories occupied by Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   In talks with Arab leaders, Kelly said he was convinced that
their major concern is resettlement of Soviet Jews in the
territories, not simply the fact that the Jews were arriving.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., challenged Kelly about the
administration's position on resettlement of Soviet Jews in the
West Bank or Gaza.
   He said it was a ``preposterous notion that a democratic society
should exclude its citizens from living where they want.'' But
Kelly said expansion of the settlements could undermine efforts for
peace.
   He also said the administration has not taken a position on
proposed legislation that would guarantee $400 million in loans for
new housing for the immigrants in Israel.
   Baker told Peretz that he hoped Israel would respond favorably
soon to proposals for holding talks on elections among the
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, according to the sources
reporting on the talks on condition that they not be identified.
   Peretz, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi, also told Baker at their brief
meeting that the future status of Jerusalem as Israel's capital was
inviolate and was off limits in any negotiations with Palestinians.
   The United States refuses to recognize Jerusalem as the capital,
saying the status of the city must be resolved in international
negotiations. Israel captured the eastern part of Jerusalem in 1967
from Jordan and has since annexed it.
   Baker has expressed impatience with Israel's failure to respond
to his proposals for talks to set up elections among the 1.7
million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.
   The Likud Party, which is the senior partner in Israel's ruling
coalition, is in disarray over the proposal. Hardliners fear talks
with a Palestinian delegation could result in Israel being forced
to talk to the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel
shuns as a terrorist organization committed to the destruction of
Israel.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met this week with
State Department officials and offered his assessment that Israel
should insist on assurances from the United States that it would
not be forced to speak with the PLO.
   Netanyahu told reporters he would recommend to Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir that Israel refuse to conduct preliminary talks with
Egypt and the United States on Palestinian elections until that
point is clear.
   U.S. officials say they cannot give Israel such assurances
because if Palestinians want the PLO to represent them, the United
States would not interfere.
   In a two-hour meeting with Dennis Ross, one of Baker's top
aides, Peretz said that the Israeli government does not channel
immigrants to the West Bank and Gaza.
   But he urged Baker to keep up the pressure on Moscow to allow
direct flights between Moscow and Tel Aviv so that Jews wishing to
emigrate could do so faster, the sources said.

<HEAD>Major Coalition To Boycott Haitian Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A major political coalition said
Wednesday it will boycott elections under military ruler Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril and joined most other parties in demanding that Avril
resign.
   In another blow to government election plans, three Electoral
Council members said they were suspending their work,
Protestant-run Radio Lumiere said.
   They said they were reacting to the refusal of nearly all
parties to run candidates as long as Avril remains in power. Many
critics of the government doubt that Avril really intends to usher
in true democracy.
   ``The road along which Gen. Avril persists in leading the
country is a dead end,'' said a statement by the centrist National
Alliance for Progress and Democracy.
   Marc Bazin, president of the three-party coalition, signed the
statement. He said elections under Avril would be a ``farce.''
   The opposition is angry about a government crackdown in January.
Officials forced seven prominent critics into exile and arrested 50
others who were allegedly beaten before their release.
   The three Electoral Council members urged the six other members
also to abandon election preparations.
   ``In the face of all the dissensions within and disputes outside
the Council, we are asking it to call a brief halt'' to election
preparation activities, said Council treasurer Jacques Jovin and
members Pauris Jean-Baptiste and Archange Leon in an open letter to
the Electoral Council.
   Jovin told The Associated Press he would ultimately resign if
political parties persist in their boycott.
   The Electoral Council was appointed by the Roman Catholic
Church, unions, human rights groups and other organizations. It was
empowered by the government to organize and supervise elections.
   Haiti, with a long history of military rule, tried to hold
independently organized elections in November 1987. These were
canceled, however, after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at
least 34 voters at voting stations.
   Then-ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who assumed power after
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986,
organized army-run elections in January 1988.
   However, charges of election fraud abounded and most voters and
parties boycotted the vote.
   The brief period of civilian rule ended in June 1988 when Namphy
ousted the winner of the elections, Leslie Manigat.
   A soldiers' revolt overthrew Namphy and brought Avril to power
in September 1988.

   A former Food and Drug Administration official
says he was sent a $300 color television set by a generic drug
company that was trying to get products approved by the agency, but
he returned it, according to transcripts of testimony released
Wednesday.
   Martin Seife, former director of the Food and Drug
Administration's generic drug division, told a House investigations
subcommittee the incident occurred in 1974 when he was a reviewer
in the division.
   Seife said he received a package in the mail at his home from
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. of Copiague, N.Y., and when he
unwrapped it, he was ``shocked and chagrined'' to find a color TV
set.
   He said he sent it back immediately and ``nobody ever approached
me in this manner again.''
   Included in the transcripts was a letter to Seife from Robert
Shulman, then president of Bolar, apologizing ``for an unfortunate
incident that I'm sure embarrassed both of us.'' Shulman recently
resigned.
   The letter explained: ``I just meant to say thank you to someone
I felt had shown us some understanding and compassion that he
didn't have to.''
   Eugene Pfeifer, a Washington, D.C., attorney representing Bolar,
said he was aware of the incident but added, ``We have no reason to
believe it was a practice ... We're not aware of anything else like
that.''
   Such a gift would be considered an illegal gratuity. Though the
statute of limitations on prosecution has expired, the transcripts
have been turned over to the U.S. attorney in Baltimore for
determination as to whether it represents part of a pattern of
conduct, said a subcommittee source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Seife testified in secret before the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee on May 3 last year.
   Seife, who recently retired from the FDA, has been a principal
source for the subcommittee, which uncovered allegations of fraud,
bribery and mismanagement in the FDA's generic drug division.
   The scandal became public last spring and led to bribery
convictions of three generic drug company executives and
bribe-taking convictions of three FDA employees.
   The investigation also uncovered evidence that some drug
companies had cheated on FDA potency tests, which prompted recalls
of dozens of generic drugs, including both generic versions of the
widely prescribed high-blood-pressure drug Dyazide.
   Bolar recalled its version of Dyazide in January after the
company's lawyers said documents supporting claims about the drug
appeared to be false.

<HEAD>U.N. Observer: Human Rights Improved in Romania, But Work Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. observer said Wednesday that respect for
human rights has improved markedly since Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu was ousted, but more remains to be done.
   The observer, Swiss jurist Joseph Voyame, told a news conference
that despite the improvement since the December revolution, human
rights ``have not yet been fully put into practice.''
   He suggested that the U.N. Human Rights Commission maintain its
watch in Romania for at least another year.
   He said he believed free elections are possible under present
conditions ``despite the fears that still exist.'' Elections are
set for May. A provisional government is now running the country.
   Hungary, which is concerned about treatment of the 1.7 million
ethnic Hungarians in Romania, has already proposed that the
commission renew Voyame's mandate.
   Ceausescu was ousted in December following a popular revolt and
was executed along with his wife, Elena, on Christmas Day. The
revolution ended more than four decades of Communist rule.
   Voyame, acting under a mandate from the 43-nation commission,
visited Romania early this month. He submitted his findings in a
report released last week.

<HEAD>Ousted Mercenary to Remain in South Africa Until Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A mercenary who ruled the
Comoros Islands until French troops forced him into exile will stay
in South Africa until after elections in the Indian Ocean
archipelago, the government said Wednesday.
   French Mercenary Bob Denard has been in South Africa since Dec.
15, the day after French troops landed in the Comoros Republic and
ended the hold on power by Denard's Presidential Guard.
   Denard and about 30 other European mercenaries had controlled
the three-island nation since the Nov. 26 shooting death of
President Ahmed Abdallah.
   South Africa, which had helped fund the Presidential Guard,
ended its support and agreed to give Denard temporary residence
until he found a place to settle.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Wednesday that after consulting
with French and Comoros authorities, the decision was made to let
Denard remain in South Africa. He said officials feared his return
to France or movement to another country might disturb the election
process in the Comoros, where a new government is being formed.
   The circumstances of Abdallah's death remain unclear, and many
Comorans blame Denard. He has denied involvement.
   Denard helped engineer a 1975 coup that ousted Abdallah. Then he
led a 1978 coup that restored Abdallah to power in the former
French colony.
   The mercenary remained a leading power in the islands before
taking over when Abdallah died.

   Lawyers for Juan Ponce Enrile asked
the Supreme Court on Wednesday to free the opposition senator, who
was arrested on charges of backing December's failed coup.
   Vice President Salvador Laurel described the arrest of the
former defense minister as an attempt to silence the opposition.
Laurel broke with President Corazon Aquino in 1987 and later joined
Enrile in forming the opposition Nacionalista Party.
   ``It could only be the beginning,'' Laurel told reporters. ``It
is not the end. We are bracing for that. We are prepared for the
worst. ... I think Mrs. Aquino is exacerbating the fragmentation
and disunity of the nation.''
   Enrile, who played a key role in bringing Mrs. Aquino to power
in a 1986 uprising, was arrested Tuesday, held overnight at the
National Bureau of Investigation, and transferred early Wednesday
to police headquarters in suburban Quezon City. He faces charges of
``rebellion with murder.''
   Military dissidents claimed the arrest of one of the
administration's sharpest critics was a prelude to martial law.
   In a petition filed Wednesday, Enrile's law partner, Renato
Cayetano, claimed the arrest was illegal and violated the senator's
rights. The petition asked that Enrile be freed.
   Court officials said no hearing had been scheduled.
   Also Wednesday, three senators filed a proposal asking judicial
authorities to place Enrile under the custody of the Senate's
sergeant-at-arms to allow the lone opposition senator to attend
sessions.
   Enrile, who was among seven people indicted Tuesday, denied any
role in the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt that left at least 113 people
dead and wounded more than 600.
   Indicted with 66-year-old Enrile, were dismissed Lt. Col.
Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan; Rodolfo Aguinaldo, suspended governor
of Cagayan province; ret. Brig. Gen. Felix Brawner; retired Lt.
Col. Billy Bibit; and businessman Rebecco Panlilio and his wife,
Erlinda.
   In the northern province of Cagayan, a local government official
said Aguinaldo, a former army lieutenant colonel, was reported to
have gone in hiding after learning late Tuesday that an arrest
warrant would be served on him the next day.
   Enrile is the most prominent figure charged in any of the six
coup attempts since Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in February 1986
by the military-popular uprising that drove the late President
Ferdinand E. Marcos into exile.
   Troops went on alert in the Manila area Tuesday to prevent
possible reprisals after the arrest, according to presidential
spokesman Tomas Gomez.
   On Wednesday, police defused a homemade bomb outside a shopping
center in Manila's financial district of Makati. Police said they
did not know who placed the bomb.
   Enrile was defense minister under Marcos but turned against him
and led the military mutiny that prompted the uprising. He kept the
post under Mrs. Aquino, but he was fired in November 1986 after a
coup attempt by his followers.
   A spokesman for soldiers involved in the December coup said the
nation ``should brace itself for the imminent declaration of
martial law.''
   However, in a radio interview Wednesday, Gomez said the charges
were justified because Enrile led ``the numerous attempts at a coup
d'etat to destroy this government of ours.''
   Enrile was arrested after three witnesses claimed they saw
Honasan and about 100 rebels at Enrile's home on the first day of
the failed coup. The senator claims not to have seen Honasan, his
former protege, since 1987.

<HEAD>Kohl: Germanys Should Make Formal Declarations Supporting Polish
Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl favors the two
German parliaments making formal statements that recognize Poland's
western border, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.
   Speaking in an East German television interview Wednesday night,
Kohl seemed annoyed over worries, even among his allies, about his
stance on the border issue.
   ``In many speeches I have said that no one wants to connect the
unity of the Germans with moving the borders. I don't know what
more I can say,'' Kohl said on East Germany's ``Aktuella Kamera''
news program.
   Kohl has come under sharp criticism abroad and at home for what
is seen as an unclear position on lands east of the Oder and Neisse
rivers once held by Germany and now part of Poland.
   The land _ about one-third of present-day Poland _ was given to
that country after the defeat in 1945 of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Kohl has never formally stated that a united Germany would not
lay claim to that land and this is viewed as a major difficulty in
the unification process.
   Poland, the United States and Britain, among others, have
expressed concern over what they consider Kohl's lack of action.
   Kohl, apparently seeking to soothe his critics, told his Cabinet
Wednesday he ``understands the Polish wish for a legally binding
recognition'' of Poland's western borders, said government
spokesman Dieter Vogel.
   The chancellor also said he sees the possibility that after East
Germany's elections on March 18, the parliaments of both German
nations could issue declarations on the matter, said Vogel.
   Vogel said such a declaration could confirm a resolution already
passed by the West German parliament on Nov. 8 stating that Germans
``neither now nor in the future'' will attempt to change the border.
   Nonetheless, in the Wednesday night interview, Kohl reiterated
his view that only a united German government could have final say
about a possible treaty giving a united Germany's formal
recognition of the current border.
   Kohl said only the ``highest sovereign German power in the case
of reunification'' could conclude such a treaty.
   He also dismissed any fears of the rise of a ``Fourth Reich'' as
``rubbish.'' ``The Germans are completely immersed in international
responsibility,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl, under pressure from archconservative voters, has sought to
allay Polish worries but at the same time has insisted only a
united Germany could take an official stand on the border issue.
   The opposition Social Democrats have charged that with such
pronouncements, Kohl is endangering international support for
German unification.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the Social Democrats, said Wednesday
Kohl's statements about the border issue have been ``irresponsible
and detrimental ... to German interests.''
   Kohl also has come under sharp criticism from the junior
partners in his coalition government, the liberal Free Democrats of
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Genscher himself has said the matter should be cleared up, and
has expressed interest in a Polish proposal that Poland and the two
German nations work up a border treaty to be signed and ratified
after formal German unification.
   Juergen Chrobog, Genscher's spokesman, said the foreign minister
``referred to the importance'' of this proposal during Wednesday's
Cabinet session.
   But West Germany's 2 million-strong Association of Exiles said
it would take legal action if a united Germany formally recognized
Poland's western border.

<HEAD>CDC Draft Report: Federal AIDS Dollars Will Slow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Federal financing for AIDS prevention is unlikely
to continue to grow as fast in the 1990s as it did during the
epidemic's first decade, the Centers for Disease Control warns in a
draft of a new report.
   ``Program needs can be expected to continue to grow at a pace
that will probably exceed available resources,'' the Atlanta-based
agency said in the draft of its ``Strategic Plan for Prevention of
HIV Infection, 1990 _ and Beyond.''
   ``We must approach our planning with an awareness of these
changes and a willingness to change,'' it said.
   The agency's congressional appropriation for AIDS programs in
the current fiscal year is $443 million, up 17 percent from 1988-9.
President Bush's request for the next fiscal year is $509 million,
an increase of less than 15 percent.
   ``The rapid increase in funding in the mid-'80s is leveling
off,'' said Dr. Gary Noble, deputy director for AIDS programs.
``There's a growing recognition that AIDS has to compete with all
the other health problems, and all the other national priorities.
   ``The funding can't continue to increase at the rate that it
did, without curtailing other high priority programs.''
   The 50-page report, which is being circulated to public health
professionals, AIDS experts and educators, outlines the agency's
goals and objectives for AIDS, based on 16 ``planning assumptions.''
   Among those assumptions:
   _ The AIDS epidemic is actually composed of ``multiple
sub-epidemics,'' chiefly among homosexual men, ``selected racial
and ethnic minority populations'' and intravenous drug abusers.
   ``Our efforts to intervene must be tailored to the specific
needs of those sub-populations,'' Noble said.
   ``The rate of change in the epidemic is not the same for each of
those sub-epidemics,'' he added, noting a slowing of AIDS in some
gay white male big-city populations, while AIDS continues to soar
among intravenous drug abusers.
   _ Human immunodeficiency virus, the AIDS virus, ``causes a
lifelong, persistent infection usually leading to progressive
illness and death,'' although 10 years or more can pass between
initial infection and illness.
   _ ``Behaviors are major determinants of HIV infection,''
including gay male sex, multiple sex partners and having sex or
sharing drug needles with infected people.
   The report says that to prevent sexaul transmission of AIDS, the
CDC needs to support and promote counseling, testing, referral and
notification of sexual partners.
   Opportunities for medical interventions to prolong the life of
AIDS-infected people will be lost unless major barriers to testing
programs, such as fear of public exposure and discrimination, are
removed, it says.
   But some AIDS activists have said testing and counseling aren't
nearly enough.
   ``Once we test all these people, what are we going to do with
them?'' Mike Merdian, executive director of the National
Association of People With AIDS, said in comments published in
Wednesday's Atlanta Constitution. ``You can't talk about testing
without talking about treatment.''
   Merdian did not return calls for further comment Wednesday.
   The draft report said the CDC should develop and evaluate better
tests for AIDS-related viruses to better prevent transmission
through the blood supply. The agency noted that the risk of AIDS
transmission through blood transfusion is small, but still exists,
with current testing procedures.
   Recommendations in the plan are not specific suggestions to each
and every state and local health agency, but rather are a plan,
communicating generally to the public, Noble said.
   After public comment and possible revisions, the CDC report is
scheduled for release in June.
   The CDC estimates that 1 million Americans are infected with
HIV, while another 52,000-57,000 AIDS cases will be diagnosed this
year. More than 117,000 AIDS cases have been reported since 1981.

<HEAD>Doctors Hail Decision to Reimburse Abortion Pill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of a major abortion clinic on Wednesday
hailed the government's decision to subsidize abortions performed
with the controversial RU 486 pill and said it would not increase
the number of pregnancies terminated in France.
   The government announced this week that the cost of the
procedure would be reimbursed under the national health care
program, which covers most medical and dental care costs in France.
   ``We're very pleased with the decision, which we've been
expecting for some time,'' said Dr. Elisabeth Aubeny, chief of the
abortion clinic at the Broussais Hospital in Paris.
   ``But it won't increase the number of abortions performed in
France because the decision to terminate a pregnancy is not a
question of money _ it's because the patient has no other choice,''
she said in a telephone interview.
   Under a decree signed Monday by Health Minister Claude Evin,
women undergoing drug-induced abortions will be reimbursed 80
percent of the actual cost of $246.
   The pill procedure costs only slightly more than other types of
abortion, which have been legal in France since 1975 and have been
partially covered by the national health care program since 1983.
   The RU 486 pill, or mifepristone, invented by French researcher
Etienne-Emile Beaulieu for the Roussel-Uclaf pharmaceutical
company, was first authorized for use in September 1988.
   However, Roussel, pressured by anti-abortion activists in Europe
and the United States, withdrew it from the market. The government
then ordered the company to resume distribution.
   The pill, known under the brand name Mifegyne, has been
distributed widely in France free of charge, but the company said
Wednesday it will now be marketed commercially. It is not for sale
elsewhere.
   Dr. Aubeny predicted more women would turn to the RU 486, a
safer and simpler alternative to traditional methods of abortion.
   ``There are both physical and psychological advantages to using
the abortion pill. It avoids the many complications that go with
surgery and anesthesia and makes patients feel more involved in the
procedure,'' she said.
   The pill, a synthetic hormone compound, works by blocking the
action of progesterone, a hormone essential in all stages of
pregnancy. Researchers say RU 486 is especially effective in the
early stages of pregnancy.
   There are 793 centers throughout France that distribute the
pill. About 20,000 women have had drug-induced abortions.
   The RU 486 is not a do-it-yourself, morning-after pill that can
be purchased over the counter and taken at home. It is dispensed
only in government-approved hospitals and clinics where patients
are screened for potential physical and psychological problems.
   Three appointments are needed, spread over a seven-day period as
required by French law. First, patients take three tablets of
mifepristone simultaneously. Two days later, they receive an
injection of the hormone prostaglandin, which produces contractions
to dislodge the fertilized egg.
   Dr. Aubeny said the egg is usually expelled within 12 hours. At
Broussais Hospital, patients receive their injections in the
morning and spend the rest of the day under observation.
   The procedure is followed by a check-up, including an ultrasound
test to make sure the pregnancy has been terminated.
   There were 162,960 abortions performed in france in 1988.
Figures for 1989 have not been released.

   A 12-vehicle highway pileup killed
16 people Wednesday, including 11 policemen, and seriously injured
22, the national news agency Bernama reported.
   It quoted witnesses as saying a bus apparently went out of
control coming down a slope and collided with several cars. Bernama
said the body of a police truck ended up wedged in the wrecked bus.
   It said that the bus, the police truck, five cars, two taxis, a
small truck, a tanker and a trailer truck were involved in the
crash near a half-mile-long tunnel 15 miles east of Kuala Lumpur,
the capital.
   The 11 dead officers were from the paramilitary Federal Reserve
Unit, normally deployed to fight communist guerrillas in the
jungles, Bernama said.

   Disposable packaging accounts for about
one-third of the more than 60 billion pounds of plastics produced
annually and very little is recycled, the Environmental Protection
Agency said Wednesday.
   The EPA in a report to Congress noted that the plastics industry
in recent years has stepped up its recycling efforts, but the
agency said less than 1 percent of all plastic is recycled.
   ``We expect that amount to increase'' because of recent efforts
by the plastics industry to push recycling, said Robin Woods, a
spokeswoman for the EPA.
   The EPA said that plastics account for about 7 percent of
municipal solid waste by weight and, depending on various studies,
between 14 percent and 21 percent of waste by volume.
   ``The plastic waste stream has quadrupled since 1970. It will
increase by 50 percent by the year 2000,'' said the EPA.

<HEAD>Barring of Gays from Volunteer Role Urged By Senator</HEAD>

   The Senate abruptly halted debate on $125
million in aid for volunteer groups Tuesday after squabbling broke
out over whether homosexuals should be allowed to serve as coaches,
teachers and in similar jobs.
   ``The District of Columbia is trying to force Big Brothers and
other service organizations to accept homosexual persons into their
organizations as counselors and role models and I think that's
intolerable,'' said Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo.
   The Senate had been expected to finish work Tuesday night on a
$125 million authorization bill for programs to reward volunteers
to aiding senior citizens, the homeless and others in need.
   But lawmakers halted work for the night after getting bogged
down over an Armstrong plan to nullify a District government policy
that requires service groups to consider homosexual applicants for
membership.
   Armstrong would change local law to say that none of its
provisions would ``bar any organization or entity from denying,
restricting, abridging or conditioning the participation'' of
homosexuals from any activity that ``educates, coaches or trains
any minor or ... holds out the adult as a role model mentor or
companion to any minor.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called on the Senate to table,
or kill, Armstrong's proposal, saying that no one had asked for it
and that lawmakers should not impose something on the nation's
capital that would not apply to the rest of the country.
   ``What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander,'' Kennedy
said.
   But Kennedy, manager of the volunteer bill, did not press for a
vote on his move. Instead, he said that enough work remained on the
legislation that the Senate should cease work for the night and
start fresh in the morning.
   Armstrong's measure brought a sharp rebuke from the Human Rights
Campaign Fund, a gay and lesbian political group.
   ``We consider it a legislative hate crime against lesbians and
gays,'' said fund spokesman Gregory King. The organization was a
strong supporter of legislation recently passed by the Senate that
calls on the Justice Department to compile statistics on ``hate
crimes'' aimed at minority groups.

<HEAD>Mexican Opposition Leader Said Post-Election Violence Increasing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TALLI NAUMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major opposition party leader, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, blamed the government on Wednesday for increased
postelection violence that blocked roads to airports in the resort
cities of Acapulco and Ixtapa.
   ``The government is unleashing violence,'' Cardenas, coordinator
of the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party, told a news
conference.
   ``This is not just another incident. There has been an increase
in the seriousness and degree of disrespect by authorities in
several states of the republic.''
   He said his party plans to file a complaint with U.N. human
rights authorities.
   Federal highway police said two party members and one officer
died Tuesday in clashes on airport roads in the southwestern
coastal state of Guerrero.
   Cardenas said one person, a party member, was killed, and not
three people.
   ``The hand of the government is behind reports that my
colleagues planned to take over the terminals and that they
provoked a confrontation,'' he said.
   Attorney General Rafael Robles Catalan of Guerrero state said he
ordered police to disperse party members ``because the governor
doesn't want vandalism and is trying to protect the community,''
Excelsior news service reported.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party was formed last year by
members of a coalition that supported Cardenas in his unsuccessful
July 1988 presidential bid. It challenged Dec. 3 local election
results in 20 Guerrero municipalities.
   Cardenas said 63 of his supporters now have been killed in
election-related violence nationwide since the week of presidential
voting in 1988.
   On Jan. 28, his party demanded a government investigation into
the deaths of 56 supporters in violence related to local elections
around Mexico. Since then seven more have died, two of them in
Guerrero state, Cardenas said.
   Dozens of demonstrators were injured and some disappeared in
Guerrero Tuesday when officers tried to stop the protests, Cardenas
said. He said party leaders had police permission to hold the
protests.
   Party leaders told officers in Acapulco and Ixtapa that about
2,500 people in each place planned to distribute leaflets in
traffic on airport access routes, he said.
   Police estimated the number of demonstrators on each airport
road at 300.
   Cardenas said more protests were planned.
   He said the party is pressing in congress for impeachment of
Gov. Francisco Ruiz Massieu of Guerrero's governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
   However, he added, ``the climate of violence doesn't come from
local politics, but is part of a national political climate
generated by central policies from Mexico City.''
   Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios said Saturday the
government sought in talks with opposition parties to avoid
``violent and passionate outlooks'' to reach accords on electoral
conflicts.
   But Cardenas insisted, ``There hasn't been a policy on the
government's part of respect for finding political resolutions.''
   ``If the authorities respected the law, there wouldn't have been
electoral fraud on Dec. 3 and the continuing incidence of
violence,'' he said.
   The party has also reported recent election-related armed
conflicts in Michoacan, Puebla, Morelos and Oaxaca states.

   A senior government official's prediction that
230,000 Soviet Jews could immigrate to Israel this year heightened
fears Wednesday that Israel was unprepared to handle the influx.
   ``Panic: a quarter-million new immigrants on their way,'' read a
banner headline in the Hebrew daily Hadashot.
   The daily Maariv and state-run Israel Radio noted the new figure
heightened confusion over immigration estimates since most
officials are predicting that about 100,000 Soviet Jews will arrive
this year.
   Even that number could be a problem. Israel has geared up to
receive only about 50,000.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, sharply criticized
Arab states that object to the immigration of Soviet Jews here and
called them the ``enemy of Israel.''
   Shamir told U.S. Jewish leaders that the Arab campaign to halt
immigration to Israel was ``hysterical.''
   ``We say to all Arab countries _ including Egypt _ that anyone
who fights against this immigration reveals himself as an enemy of
Israel,'' he told members of the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations.
   Arab states fear that the Soviet Jews will be settled in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestine Liberation
Organization has declared its independent state.
   Israeli officials have repeatedly denied there is a government
policy of settling Soviet Jews in the occupied lands. Available
figures indicate that only about 200 of 12,000 Soviet Jews who
arrived last year decided on settling in the territories.
   About 100 are believed to have settled in the territories in the
last few months.
   ``If anyone expects me to say that we shall forbid any Jew from
going to Judea, Samaria or elsewhere _ I shall never do that,''
Shamir told the American Jewish leaders, using the biblical names
for the West Bank.
   The higher prediction of Soviet Jewish immigration came from
Yasha Kazakov, deputy head of the Liaison Bureau, a once-secret
government department that deals with Soviet Jewry, Israeli media
said.
   Kazakov gave the figure Tuesday to a group of directors of
government ministries that handle immigration matters, Hadashot
reported.
   ``When he pulled out the numbers we were in a state of shock,''
Ephraim Cohen, deputy director of the Absorption Ministry, told
Maariv. ``There was silence in the hall.''
   Kazakov said he thought 50,000 Soviet Jews would arrive by June,
an additional 120,000 in the summer and 60,000 more in the last
four months, Maariv said.
   His projections were based on the possibility of increased
emigration via the existing routes through Romania and Hungary and
new exit routes through Czechoslovakia, Finland and Poland, Maariv
said.
   Soviet authorities have so far refused Israeli requests to allow
emigrants to fly directly from the Soviet Union to Israel. Arab
nations have urged the Kremlin to restrict Jewish emigration.
   So far this year, 9,441 Soviet Jews have arrived, joining more
than 12,000 who immigrated to Israel in 1989.
   The upsurge in Soviet Jewish arrivals comes as a result of more
liberal Soviet emigration policies, fears of rising anti-Semitism
in the Soviet Union, and U.S. visa restrictions.
   Gennady Zhuravlev, the Soviet amabassador to Egypt, charged
Monday that Israel was deliberately overestimating the number of
Soviet Jews it expects in order to obtain more aid from the United
States and other Western nations.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz, speaking Wednesday on Israel
army radio in a telephone interview from New York, said he was
visiting the United States to try to get more help from American
Jews for the immigrants.
   ``Without a massive help from the Jewish people, we will not be
able to fulfill this historic mission,'' Peretz said.
   Peretz said it was hard to predict immigration accurately.
   ``Undoubtedly, at least 120,000 to 150,000 will come with God's
help, but there may be surprises and many more may come,'' he said.
   Peretz did not say whether his figures referred only to Soviet
Jews or included immigrants from other countries as well.
   Meanwhile, Uri Gordon, head of the Immigration Department at the
Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental body that deals with
immigrants, demanded that Israel declare a state of emergency to
deal with the Soviet immigrants.
   ``It does not matter whether we expect 100,000 or 200,000,''
Gordon said. ``Masses of Jews could come. ... This obliges us to
declare an emergency situation and set different priorities.''
   He mentioned the possibility of converting youth hostels to
housing for the newcomers.

   The Swedish navy fired underwater
grenades Wednesday at a suspected alien submarine, the target of a
weeklong search in a sensitive coastal zone south of Stockholm, the
defense command said.
   Spokesman H.G. Wessberg said anti-submarine sonar may have
picked up an echo from a rock on the seabed, instead of an
intruding vessel. But the search for an intruder was continuing.
   The grenades were launched about 21 miles from Stockholm. No
trace of a damaged sub was found, said a communique.
   ``There's a lot to indicate that it was a protrusion on the
bottom of the sea,'' said Wessberg. Sonar is easily distorted in
the shallow and brackish sea, defense experts say.
   Coastal units first detected indications last Thursday that
Swedish waters may have been violated.
   It was the third time since the weekend that the Swedes fired at
what they believed to be a foreign sub or group of minisubs.
   Rand Corp., a U.S. research institute, said two weeks ago that
Soviet subs stepped up illegal incursions in Swedish waters after
Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   Swedish researcher Wilhelm Agrell said in January that the
Soviet military intelligence agency GRU was carrying out the
intrusions, using minisubmarines launched from a mobile trailer
system in the Baltic republics.
   The Swedish military upgraded its antisubmarine capability after
a Soviet submarined was grounded outside Karlskrona naval base in
1981.

   President Bush, visiting New York for a
political fund raiser, couldn't resist making a joke Wednesday
about the headline-grabbing divorce fight between Donald and Ivana
Trump.
   Bush told the crowd his arrival one month before a Staten Island
congressional election had put him in the midst of ``one of the
greatest contests of 1990,'' a battle with ``a lot at stake, a lot
of money spent on both sides, a lot of press attention.''
   Pause.
   ``But I'm not here to talk about the Trumps.''
   Ba-dum-dum.
   Turns out this was just the start of the president's shtick.
Bush, after referring to his wife Barbara as ``the silver fox,''
attributed her absence Wednesday to the presence of Staten Island
borough president Guy V. Molinari and his full head of gray hair.
   ``The only reason she's not here is she didn't want to put her
hairdo up against Guy's,'' said Bush.
   The president, who received a good deal of positive press when
the first dog, Millie, had a White House litter, also offered this
advice to congressional candidate Susan Molinari: ``Puppies: worth
10 points easy.''

<HEAD>Durenberger Says Failure To Disclose $485,000 Loan Was
Misunderstanding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The failure of Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn., to disclose an unsecured $485,000 loan resulted from a
misunderstanding of Senate rules, aides said Thursday.
   Three other loans that the Minnesota Republican took out from
Commercial State Bank of St. Paul, Minn., were not listed
separately on his financial disclosure form, according to his
staff. That also may be a violation of Senate rules.
   It was the first attempt by Durenberger's office to explain
apparent errors in reporting favorable borrowings from the
Minnesota bank. The reporting discrepancies were made public three
weeks ago in a newspaper article that disclosed the favorable terms
Durenberger received on a series of loans from the bank.
   Durenberger already is under investigation by the Senate Ethics
Committee for failing to disclose on time reimbursement he received
from lobbyists for numerous speaking engagements in 1985 and 1986.
   ``There's absolutely no intention to leave (information) out,''
said Durenberger spokeswoman Carrie Collins. ``There's no intention
to hide anything.''
   Although the Senate Ethics Committee has not looked into the
loans, the committee last week found ``substantial credible
evidence'' of six violations of federal law and Senate rules in the
senator's financial conduct.
   Trial-like hearings on those allegations, which focus on a book
contract he used to raise $100,000 in speaking fees, could begin
later this month.
   The borrowings that Durenberger apparently did not disclose
properly were among 20 unsecured loans totaling $1.27 million he
obtained from the Commercial State Bank of St. Paul from 1979 to
1988.
   Durenberger's 1988 financial disclosure report listed three
loans from Commercial State Bank, but missing from the form was the
short-term $484,332 loan the senator got in June 1988 to obtain
financing on a McLean, Va., townhouse.
   The attorney who prepared the report thought the ``swing'' loan
did not have to be reported because senators are not required to
disclose loans on their personal residences that are secured by the
property, according to a statement issued by Bert McKasy, the
senator's chief of staff.
   The senator's 1983 report listed only one liability with
Commercial State Bank, although he borrowed from the bank three
times at varying interest rates less than the rate he reported.
   An $85,000 loan taken out in 1982 at 13 percent interest was
renewed and increased to $90,000 in January 1983, according to the
statement. A $15,000 loan was taken out at 11.5 percent in April of
that year. A third loan of $10,000 was obtained in December at 12
percent interest.
   The financial disclosure report listed only: a ``personal
promissory note'' in the category of value of $100,001 to $250,000
at an interest rate of 13 percent.
   ``It was the understanding of the preparer that the forms could
be filled out in that way,'' Collins said. ``The intent was to
represent the total amount of liability that was due Commercial
State Bank within that time frame (1983) and that was done.''
   However, instructions provided with the financial disclosure
forms specify that senators must disclose the amount, maturity
date, repayment terms and interest rate for ``each liability''
exceeding $10,000.
   The instructions ``would require that you report each loan
individually,'' said Wilson Abney, the Ethics Committee's chief of
staff.

<HEAD>Boy Given Alcohol Dies After Respirator Removed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 5-year-old boy who the authorities
said was given 10 ounces of bourbon by an adult and told to ``drink
it like a man'' died Wednesday almost 11 hours after being removed
from life-support systems.
   Doctors said Raymond Thomas Griffin II fell into a coma and
suffered irreversible brain damage after a 21-year-old party guest
at his home allegedly told him to drink the alcohol Friday night,
police said.
   He died at Cook-Fort Worth Children's Medical Center at 8:45
a.m. Wednesday, the hospital said. Griffin's family agreed to
disconnect the life support system that had kept him alive at about
10 p.m. Tuesday, but the child had continued to breathe on his own.
   Anthony Jimerson, 21, of Forest Hills was being held in the
Tarrant County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail after being charged
with injury to a child, officials said. The charge carries a
maximum 99-year prison term.
   Police and prosecutors were discussing upgrading the charges
against Jimerson, who told the boy to drink the alcohol, said
Everman police Detective J.D. Brown. He said he did not anticipate
new charges immediately.
   It was unclear whether the boy's mother, Patricia Griffin, 31,
knew that the boy was being given liquor, or whether she found out
later when Raymond became ill.
   ``We're getting some conflicting stories on whether she knew,
whether she was told that night or in the morning,'' Brown said.
   Brown said it appeared that the boy began having convulsions at
about 3 a.m. Saturday, but an ambulance was not called until 2:45
p.m.
   Brown said Ms. Griffin probably would be interviewed after the
boy's funeral.
   The amount the boy drank was the equivalent of an adult
chug-a-luging a fifth of liquor, officials said. Doctors said the
boy's blood alcohol level was .55 percent, more than five times the
legal limit of intoxication in Texas.
   Brown said doctors indicated they might have been able to help
the boy if he had been brought in sooner.
   ``That's a question I've placed and directed straight to the
doctor and the neurologist that treated Raymond,'' he said. ``If it
had been recognized immediately, it is a very, very good
possibility that they could have helped or saved him or maybe even
stopped the damage.''
   Brown said he had seen the boy before at the suburban apartment
complex where Raymond lived with his mother and 2-year-old brother.
   ``He was just a bright, inquisitive child, very polite,'' he
said.
   ``He was intelligent for a 5-year-old,'' the father, Raymond
Griffin of Myrtle Beach, S.C., told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
``I used to read to him a lot and I didn't read him comic books. I
read him Time, books about leadership, books about my work in the
Army.
   ``He was going to be brilliant.''

   Senate leaders and the Bush administration

   Closed-door negotiations continued into the evening over details
about new acid rain controls, but sources close to the talks said
those issues were unlikely to scuttle the rest of the pollution
control package which has been worked out in three weeks of
bargaining.
   Disagreements over acid rain might be set aside and be thrashed
out on the Senate floor if the differences, involving largely
disagreements among senators, are not resolved, said an aide to one
senator who has been close to the private talks.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he planned
to bring the clean air bill to the Senate floor on Thursday and had
no desire to extend the private bargaining with the administration
for another day.
   The talks, which had gone past midnight twice this week,
continued into the evening as negotiators focused on remaining
disagreements over provisions on controlling acid rain. It was the
only remaining area of disagreement, the sources said.
   While Senate leaders and the Bush administration have agreed on
most of the acid rain provision, individual senators have not.
   A group of Midwest senators have threatened to filibuster
against the clean air bill if they do not receive help in paying
for the expensive pollution controls that would be required at many
of that region's coal-fired electric plants have to meet the deep
cuts required for acid rain pollution.
   Other senators have balked at such cot-sharing because, they
argued, their states already have paid to clean up their electric
plants. These same senators, however, have expressed concern that
the new pollution controls might inhibit growth of electric
capacity in their states.
   The negotiations turned to the acid rain issue after the two
sides agreed on how to curb emissions from automobiles and reduce
the smog problem that has plagued many urban areas.
   The issue had been among the most contentious under discussion.
The Senate bill called for two rounds of tough emission controls on
automobiles to reduce urban smog.
   The Bush administration, however, had strongly objected to the
second round of controls, saying they were too expensive and
provided only marginal benefits. Senate authors of the legislation,
however, argued the additional controls were needed for some of the
most polluted urban centers to achieve clean air.
   According to sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the
compromise agreement calls for the so-called Tier 2 controls to go
into effect nationwide only if 11 of 27 cities, now considered to
have ``serious'' air pollution problems, fail to make adequate
progress in meeting federal air quality standards by late in this
decade.
   Environmentalists criticized the compromise as being almost as
bad as not have a second round of emission controls at all. They
argued that it is unlikely that 11 the 27 cities would not be able
to achieve the federal standards since the group of 27 does not
include the eight of the country's most polluted cities which are
in categories of ``severe'' or ``extreme'' pollution.
   ``You could have cities with a total of 80 million people not in
(federal air quality) attainment and still not have a Tier 2,''
said Gene Karpinski, executive director of the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, an environmental group.
   The Senate-adminstration talks earlier this week produced
tentative agreements on how to control toxic chemicals from
industrial plants and on curbing smog-causing pollutants from an
array of stationery sources from chemical plants to dry cleaners.
   While most of the focus has been on the Senate bill in recent
weeks, a different version remains in a House committee. House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Wednesday he hoped that bill
could come up for floor consideration by April, several months
earlier than he previously had indicated.

   President Virgilio Barco said Wednesday
his government will look into accusations by the leftist Patriotic
Union party that senior military officials were responsible for
assassinating its members.
   Barco said the government was not to blame for the violence
against Patriotic Union members.
   Late Tuesday, unidentified gunmen killed six local Patriotic
Union leaders on a street in Ungia, 310 miles northwest of the
capital.
   The gunmen then fled, reported Jose Antonio Lopez in an
interview Wednesday for RCN network.
   Lopez is the party's candidate for mayor in Apartado, 35 miles
east of Ungia in the violence-plagued Uraba region bordering Panama.
   An armed group on Monday kidnapped and killed Apartado Mayor
Diana Cardona, also a Patriotic Union member. Party leaders blamed
the killing on a right-wing death squad they said was supported by
members of the military.
   The party also blamed death squads for killing a city councilman
belonging to the party, a freelance journalist and three leaders of
an agricultural cooperative this week.
   Patriotic Union leaders on Tuesday demanded that Defense
Minister Oscar Botero and three army brigade commanders be fired,
accusing them of responsibility for an extermination campaign aimed
against the party.
   Party leaders said 827 members have been killed since the
party's founding in 1985.
   Party President Diego Montana told a Tuesday news conference
that Patriotic Union members were being assassinated by
``paramilitary groups that ... are composed of members of the
military.''
   Barco said the allegations will be investigated, but added ``all
parties make accusations before elections.'' Colombia is to hold
congressional and municipal elections March 11.
   Barco spoke to reporters at Bogota airport shortly before
leaving for Montevideo to attend the inauguration of Uruguay's new
president, Luis Alberto Lacalle.
   Interior Minister Carlos Lemos, who will act as president while
Barco is away, told reporters balloting will proceed in all regions
despite pre-election violence.
   He said later Wednesday that leftist guerillas of the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, may have staged the attacks on Patriotic
Union leaders as part of a campaign to disrupt the elections.
   Lemos did not explain why the guerillas would attack the leftist
party, whose members include many ELN sympathizers and former
guerillas.
   Death squads have killed more than 1,000 people over the last
four years, according to the attorney general's office.
   Human rights officials say the death squads have been supported
by drug traffickers as well as by some members of the military.
   Meanwhile, two more drug trafficking suspects wanted for
extradition to the United States were captured, a police communique
said.
   Jorge Alirio Ortiz, an alleged member of the cocaine cartel
based in the southern city of Cali, was arrested in Ibague, the
communique said.
   Ortiz was convicted by a Washington, D.C. court on drug
trafficking charges, it said. It did not give the date of
conviction.
   Another suspect, Manuel Antonio Garces, was captured in
Medellin. Garces is wanted by a U.S. court on charges of money
laundering and cocaine distribution, the communique said.
   Since the government began its current crackdown last August, it
has extradited 14 drug suspects to the United States.
   Authorities announced Wednesday that more of the treasure
amassed by a Medellin cartel leader before he was killed had been
found by police.
   In a raid Tuesday on a Bogota house, police discovered gold
ingots and coins, platinum plates, diamond-encrusted jewelry,
Australian currency and $250,000 in U.S. currency.
   A police spokeswoman told The Associated Press that the
treasure, found in a leather suitcase and worth over $2 million,
was part of the fortune of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a former leader
of the Medellin cartel.
   Rodriguez Gacha was killed in a Dec. 15 gunfight with police. In
previous raids authorities seized $36 million of gold, cash and
jewelry.
   The police spokeswoman said two members of Rodriguez Gacha
organization were captured in the raid. She did not identify the
suspects.

   James M. Gavin, a World War II general
who helped lead the D-Day invasion and was later an outspoken
critic of U.S. military policy, was buried Wednesday with full
military honors.
   An honor guard from Gavin's famed 82nd Airborne Division fired a
three-volley salute at the funeral at the U.S. Military Academy
attended by about 200 people. Gavin was buried at the Army post's
cemetery alongside such legendary military figures as George
Armstrong Custer.
   Gavin, who died Friday in Baltimore at age 82, was one of the
last great generals from World War II.
   Old comrades in arms recalled Gavin's courage in battle and his
eagerness to embrace innovations in battlefield tactics and weapons.
   ``His physical courage was unchallenged,'' said retired Gen.
William T. Ryder. ``His intellectual bent for battle was proven.
The thing that endeared him to me the most was his integrity.
   ``Jim was one of those perceptive people, and they come few and
far between, who knew the next war would not be fought with the
last war's tools,'' Ryder said.
   Ryder parachuted into Sicily during World War II with Gavin. He
said that when the paratroops were first organized, Gavin
immediately wanted to get involved.
   ``As soon as he heard about airborne, he wanted to get out with
the paratroops,'' Ryder said. ``He was always an avant-garde
innovator.''
   Frederick Spataro of New Brunswick, N.J., a paratrooper who
fought with Gavin in Normandy, Holland and the Battle of the Bulge,
said the general was ``always the first one out of the plane.''
   Another foot soldier under Gavin, H. Joseph Hirlemann of West
Orange, N.J., said he remembered fighting at a remote outpost and
calling for more ammunition. Gavin delivered it personally.
   Gavin worked his way to the upper echelon of Army command during
a 34-year career that began in 1925 when he enlisted as a private
at age 17. He had dropped out of school after the eighth grade, but
completed his high school education as an Army private, gained
admission to West Point and was commissioned a second lieutenant in
1929.
   By the time he resigned at 51 in a dispute over the Army's role
in missile development, he was the youngest three-star general.
   A captain when World War II began, Gavin was promoted to
brigadier general by D-Day and later was given command of the 82nd
Airborne Division. At the end of the war he was a highly decorated
major general.
   After World War II, Gavin was instrumental in developing the
Army's use of the helicopter, which was used extensively in Vietnam.
   An outspoken critic of President Eisenhower, his former
commander, Gavin resigned in 1958 out of principle over his
disagreement with Pentagon policies. At the time, he was about to
take command of the Seventh Army in Europe.
   Gavin became an executive with the industrial and consulting
form of Arthur D. Little Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
   He was appointed ambassador to France by President Kennedy.
   As a civilian, Gavin continued to criticize the American
military, and was was one of the first to criticize U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
   Gavin's wartime medals include the Purple Heart, Silver Star,
and the Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf cluster. France
gave him its Croix de Guerre with palm and Britain named him to the
Distinguished Service Order.

<HEAD>Thousands Die from Negligence in Hospitals, Harvard Study Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 6,600 hospital patients died and
thousands more were injured through medical negligence in New York
state in 1984, but few malpractice suits were filed, said a Harvard
University study released Wednesday.
   Although the survey involved only New York state, researchers
said they expect a nationwide survey would find similar results.
   Dr. David Axelrod, the state health commissioner, said the
results pointed to ``major inequities'' in the medical malpractice
system, involving both compensating victims and deterring
professional misconduct.
   Axelrod, who backs a proposal for no-fault malpractice
insurance, said he believed such a reform would improve the system
because doctors would be less fearful that reporting negligence by
colleagues would bring lawsuits upon themselves or their hospital.
   But consumer rights groups and advocates for victims of medical
negligence, who oppose the no-fault plan, called for more
government policing of doctors and stiffer penalties for those
found guilty of negligence.
   Despite the thousands of instances of malpractice documented in
the study, only 26 doctors were disciplined in the state in 1984
for negligence.
   ``How can this be no one's fault?'' asked Elaine O'Rourke,
pointing to her son, who went into a Brooklyn hospital for a
bed-wetting problem and came out brain damaged and confined to a
wheelchair.
   O'Rourke and other members of her group, Stop Hospital and
Medical Errors, frequently interrupted a news conference on the
study with demands that criminal penalties be adopted for
health-care workers found guilty of negligent acts.
   Overall, the study estimated that 3.7 percent of those
hospitalized sustained an injury in the hospital ``that resulted in
measurable disability.''
   The researchers said that would translate into 99,000 injuries
out of 2.7 million people hospitalized statewide in 1984.
   Most of the injuries were relatively minor _ 70 percent of
patients recovered completely within six months. But 14 percent
were fatal, a rate which translated into more than 13,000 deaths in
1984.
   Fifty-one percent of the fatal injuries resulted from
negligence, the study found. But it noted that ``many of the deaths
occurred in patients who had greatly shortened life expectancies
from their underlying diseases.''
   Doctors and hospitals are required by state law to report all
cases of possible medical misconduct. However, Peter Slocum, a
Health Department spokesman, said the state received only 1,525
reports of possible misconduct in 1984, and only 161 came from
physicians or hospitals.
   Axelrod denied that there was a ``code of silence'' among health
care providers over reporting negligence cases. He blamed the
current tort system, which he said ``deters compliance'' with the
law.
   ``A large number of `adverse events' that occur in institutions
are not currently being reported to us,'' he said.
   The number of malpractice claims filed against doctors and
hospitals was only about 10 percent of the total number of
negligent injuries, the study found. Of the patients who were found
in the study to have been injured because of negligence, only 2
percent filed malpractice claims.
   The Medical Society of the State of New York, which supports
Axelrod's calls for malpractice reform, applauded the report and
said the current tort system was a ``grotesque failure.''
   ``It overcompensates some, but tragically it fails to compensate
many, many people who are the victims of inadequate medical care,''
spokesman Gerard L. Conway told the news conference.
   The New York State Trial Lawyers Association issued a statement
saying the state's malpractice crisis was not the fault of the
legal system, but rather ``is caused by negligent and substandard
care'' by doctors.
   The four-year, $3.1-million study, one of the most comprehensive
ever undertaken, involved a review of the records of more than
30,000 patients from 51 randomly selected hospitals in New York
state.
   The researchers stressed that the findings could not be applied
to hospitals today, since most hospitals have taken a variety of
steps since 1984 to improve patient care.
   The study looked at cases of ``unintended injury,'' which was
defined as one ``caused by medical management rather than by the
disease process.'' They included errors in performing medical
procedures, as well as diagnostic errors and improper or omitted
care.

<HEAD>Jury Rules Officers Violated Woman's Civil Rights in Domestic
Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury awarded a woman $1.1
million after deciding that four sheriff's officers, including her
estranged husband's father and uncle, violated her civil rights
when they intervened in a domestic dispute.
   Lori Bowden of Palatka said that in 1987 the four St. Johns
County officers used their positions to find and detain her so her
husband, Tommy Wayne Bowden Jr., could take their infant son from
her.
   Jurors deliberated for about 70 minutes Tuesday before ruling
against the defendants: Lt. Byron Kirkland, Deputy Melvin Tennyson
and auxiliary officers Tommy Wayne Bowden Sr. and Fleming Bowden.
The Bowdens are Tommy Bowden's father and uncle.
   Gayle Smith Swedmark, who represented the defendants, said she
will appeal ``on the basis that it was an outrageous award.''
   William L. Townsend, Mrs. Bowden's attorney, said he was
satisfied with the jury's award. ``I thought something very
outrageous had been done to her,'' he said.
   Mrs. Bowden testified that she and her husband separated in May
1987, but he returned on Oct. 5, saying he wanted to rekindle their
marriage.
   She testified that when she tried to flee, he shot the truck she
was driving, disabling it. She returned home with him but fled the
next day with her 2-year-old son, Tommy Wayne Bowden III, and filed
aggravated assault charges against her husband.
   On Oct. 9, Tennyson and the auxiliary deputies tracked her to a
friend's apartment in St. Augustine. They told her they wanted to
check on the boy's condition and refused to let her leave until her
husband also saw him. When he arrived at the apartment, he took the
boy, she said.
   She then returned home to be with her son. Five days later,
Bowden was arrested for aggravated assault.
   Townsend argued that Kirkland, the watch commander that night,
approved the officers' action despite a policy forbidding uniformed
officers from interfering in incidents involving relatives of
officers.
   Ms. Swedmark said the men were merely checking on the baby's
welfare and that it was unclear whether Bowden took the child or
Mrs. Bowden voluntarily gave him the boy.
   The Bowdens are now divorced and Mrs. Bowden has custody of
their son.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee accused President Bush on Wednesday of failing to exclude
military personnel from required budget cuts and then calling on
Congress to avert the expected layoffs.
   ``The administration is the one who clearly laid the bed of
thorns and is now pointing the finger at Congress, saying, `Help us
to get out of this situation,''' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., told
reporters shortly after a hearing at which members of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff painted a dire picture of the effect of the budget
reductions.
   The Armed Services chairman also lashed out at the Chief of
Naval Operations, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost for an absence of major
restructuring in the Navy force in response to the lessening Soviet
threat to the West.
   ``I want them to think _ T-H-I-N-K,'' said Nunn, who questioned
why one of the armed services could say that it had felt no effects
from the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe.
   Nunn and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the panel's ranking
Republican, said they favor granting the Defense Department the
authority to move $852 million from other accounts to personnel to
avoid the discharge of tens of thousands of men and women by
October.
   The cuts are required under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting law.
   But Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., the chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, told the service chiefs Monday that his
committee will not take up the issue of shifting the funds, thus
dooming the Pentagon's request.
   Such ``reprogramming'' of funds must be approved by the House
and Senate Armed Services Committees and the House and Senate
Appropriations Commitees.
   Nunn questioned the service chiefs as to why Bush did not exempt
military personnel from the cuts, an option that the president
could have exercised last August under the law.
   ``The Defense Department evidently did not come down strong on
exempting personnel. If they did, they failed within the
administration,'' Nunn said during the committee hearing. ``Now ...
everybody in the administration is pointing at Congress, saying,
`Save us from what we've done, and it's your fault if you don't
save us from what we didn't do.'
   ``That's a curious position to be in.''
   Trost said all the service chiefs argued for exempting military
personnel but were assured by administration officials that any
cuts from Gramm-Rudman would be softened by a request to shift
funds.
   ``We four all supported the need to protect our people last
fall,'' Trost said.
   Nunn said the administration shouldn't have given those
assurances based on the belief that officials could later convince
four congressional committees to accept the transfer of funds.
   ``Somebody should have checked with the four committees because,
obviously, the House wasn't plugged into that,'' Nunn said.
   He said he hoped the fund transfer could occur, but Aspin, in an
interview later in the day, said the chances of his changing his
mind are ``zero.''
   ``You'll see a lot of wheeling and dealing, but it's not going
to work,'' the House Armed Services chairman said in an interview
with several reporters.
   The Pentagon on Tuesday released estimates showing that without
the authority to transfer funds, 44,100 to 68,200 military
personnel would have to be discharged by Oct. 1; 32,500 to 32,600
people would be frozen in their current jobs; 57,000 to 67,000
promotions would be delayed; and 59,900 to 115,900 fewer people
could be brought into the armed forces.
   Questioned whether his action was irresponsible, Aspin said:
   ``I want to do the responsible thing. In the long run, make them
(the administration) understand the consequences in the short run.''

   Fabia Drake, whose acting career spanned 77 years
with credits from the Shakespearean stage to television miniseries,
died Wednesday. She was 86.
   Miss Drake died at her home in London, said fellow actress
Rachel Kempson.
   ``The lovely thing about being an ancient actress is that you
don't have to retire, it's just there are older parts to play,''
Miss Drake said in 1987.
   Her many film and television appearances included the television
miniseries ``The Jewel In The Crown'' and films including ``The
Good Companions'' in 1957, ``Fast and Loose'' in 1954, ``Young
Wives Tales'' in 1951.
   In her later work, she was often cast in ``battle axe'' roles,
according to Halliwell's ``Filmgoer's and Video Viewer's
Companion.''
   Her last role was in Milos Forman's film, ``Valmont.''
   At age 9, she made her stage debut in ``The Fairy Doll.'' She
was 13 when she appeared in a production of Shakespeare's ``Twelfth
Night'' along with a 10-year-old actor who also made good _
Laurence Olivier.
   Her first major theatrical role was as Sarah Undershaft in
George Bernard Shaw's ``Major Barbara'' in 1921.
   After leading the Royal Shakespeare Company on two tours of
North America, she married Maxwell Turner, a lawyer, in 1938 and
retired for a time. She returned in 1946 to produce Shakespeare's
``Much Ado about Nothing.''
   Turner died in 1960.
   A funeral service was set for Tuesday at the Golders Green

   Maurice A. Garbell, an aviation consultant
who was an early advocate of a successful airport noise control
plan, has died after a short illness. He was 75.
   Garbell died last Saturday at Pacific Presbyterian Hospital in
San Francisco, where he lived.
   He was an early proponent of a plan that called for noisy
jetliners to climb steeply to avoid residential neighborhoods near
airports.
   During World War II, he was a top aerodynamicist for
Consolidated Vultee Aircraft, now General Dynamics in San Diego.
There, he designed aircraft wings and wrote a book on tropical and
equatorial meteorology.
   After the war, Garbell moved to San Francisco and worked as an
aviation consultant.
   Survivors include his wife, Esther, and two daughters.

   Eighteen ships were stuck Wednesday
in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in what the Canadian Coast said were
the worst ice conditions on the waterway in 10 years.
   Andy Maillet, assistant coast guard ice operations officer, said
the combination of an early winter, extremely low temperatures and
easterly winds had created a near impenetrable layer of ice.
   ``Some of these ships have been out there quite a long time,''
Maillet said. ``Some of them have been stuck for four or five
days.''
   The ice, driven by easterly winds, runs in a line from the
Strait of Belle Isle to the Gaspe Peninsula and Anticosti Island.
   ``It has been drifting generally in a southwest direction
enabling it to press up against the Newfoundland and Cape Breton
coasts,'' Maillet said.
   The ice has disrupted shipping for the past two weeks and left
coast guard officials hoping for an early spring.
   Six icebreakers, four from Nova Scotia and one each from
Newfoundland and Quebec, were trying to break the ships free and
escort them to passable ice.
   At one point last week, 26 ships were stuck. The numbers keep
changing as some vessels break free.
   ``Once the ice pressure changes a little bit, they are able to
back away from the particular ice pan they're in and then carry on
their voyage,'' said Maillet. ``But you lose one, you gain another.
''
   He said he expected poor shipping conditions would continue for
a couple more weeks.
   Maillet said none of the 18 ships _ including tankers,
freighters and container vessels _ was in immediate danger,
although some were low on water and fuel.
   ``None of them has run out of fuel yet. We won't let them,''
Maillet said.
   He warned the situation could change quickly, however.
   ``Depending on where they get stuck, they could fall into danger
of drifting ashore,'' he said.
   Eight of the icebound ships were trying to reach gulf ports
while the other 10 were trying to get through the Cabot Strait to
the open Atlantic.
   The coast guard had to take medication by helicopter to one ship
last week while a search and rescue crew carried out a medical
evacuation of a crewmember with a badly cut finger.

<HEAD>Brazilians Struggle Back to Work After Four Days of Carnival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After four days of all-night
dancing, drinking, parades and carvinal frivality, Brazilians
straggled back to work Wednesday and stores, banks and supermarkets
reopened.
   The country's wild pre-Lenten bash came to a close in Rio, the
unofficial carnival capital, after four balls and huge street
parties that attracted thousands of city residents despite periodic
thunderstorms.
   The biggest carnival balls were televised live nationwide and,
despite an impassioned appeal from the country's justice minister
to exercise restraint on the filming of any public nudity, several
networks showed lusty scenes.
   TV Manchete, Brazil's third-largest network, had extended
coverage of the Monte Libano nightclub's ``Night in Baghdad'' ball,
filming close-up the moves of the scantily-clad and topless female
dancers.
   Also periodically shown were male party-goers, some appearing to
be near comatose from drinking, pawing at the women.
   Late Wednesday, the Mocidade Independente ``samba school'' was
crowned the winner of the city's world-famous samba parade. The
school, which included more than 500 percussionists who played a
number of exotic instruments, won a small cash prize and national
acclaim.
   The parade, considered the highlight of Brazilian carnival,
featured 16 samba schools _ neighborhood groups from poor, mostly
black districts, each with as many as 5,000 exotically costumed
dancers and musicians who march alongside huge floats to a pulsing
samba beat.
   Each school created its own samba for the parade and won points
awarded for music, floats, rythmn, team work and several other
categories. Most samba schools devote almost the entire year to
preparing for the parade, and the winners are treated like heroes.
   Rio was not plagued by exceptional levels of violence during
carnival compared to other years, officials said.
   Fifty-one people were killed in Rio during the four-day
carnival, police said. They said 57 people were murdered during the
weekend preceding the holiday.
   In some parts of this country of 150 million, celebrants refused
to bring the carnival party to a close. In northeastern Salvador,
1,050 miles from Rio, thousands of people Wednesday were still
dancing to music blared from speakers mounted on huge trucks in a
downtown square. That party began Tuesday evening.
   In Olinda, several hundred miles further up the coast, revelers
who were not satisfied with four days of madness scheduled
unofficial samba parades that were to stretch late into the night.
   Post-carnival times will be harsh for some. Inflation is more
than 70 pecent per month and President-elect Fernando Collor de
Mello, who takes office March 15, will be confronted with the
country's worst economic crisis in more than a century.

<TEXT>
   A Swedish Embassy security guard was found
beaten and shot to death Wednesday in an embassy bathroom in what
appeared to be a politically motivated attack, officials said.
   Defense Minister Gen. Alejandro Gramajo linked the killing of
Agustin Alvarado Hernandez to extremist violence in Guatemala and
to U.N. discussions in Geneva of human rights in this Central
American country.
   He said Swedish news media reported recently that Sweden had
asked the United Nations to name a human rights liaison for
Guatemala.
   ``We believe that this act of violence has to do with a policy
in which the extremes are favored, whether of the leftist remnant
of Marxist-Leninism that remains in the Caribbean and particularly
in Guatemala, or of the `super right' that I have always called
terrorist also,'' Gramajo said.
   Authorities said Hernandez worked for a private security company
contracted by the embassy. They did not say when he was killed.
   Swedish Ambassador Ulf Lewin received bomb threats on Jan. 23,
according to news reports at the time, and authorities offered to
increase security for the embassy.
   Some human rights organizations estimate more than 100,000
people have been killed in political violence in Guatemala since
1954. Right-wing death squads, which once claimed responsibility
for many assassinations, resurfaced in 1989 with an increase in
killings, kidnappings and disappearances. The squads have claimed
responsibility for only a few of the cases.
   Students, professionals, peasant leaders and others who work
with peasants have been traditional targets of the violence,
particularly during army campaigns against leftist guerrillas who
have been fighting 28 years to overthrow the succession of military
and military-dominated Guatemalan governments.

   Militant students Wednesday set fire
to a car belonging to a state-controlled student union and beat
some group leaders who came to announce a concession to the
protesters, students and witnesses said.
   On Tuesday night, soldiers marched onto the campus of the
National University of Ivory Coast, beat students with truncheons
and arrested about 30 who are being held at a military camp in the
capital, students said.
   The students began protesting Feb. 19. They have demanded
improved living conditions and better facilities, but also have
politial demands: freedom of expression and a multiparty state in
this West African nation.
   The militants also want officials to authorize a new group to
replace the Movement of Pupils and Students, the youth league of
the country's sole legal political party.
   Late Tuesday, leaders of the party-controlled union went to the
main university campus and residences scattered around the capital
to tell students the government had agreed to halve their costs of
boarding and lodging. State radio broadcast the news Wednesday.
   But the students at dormitories in Yopougon, a working class
suburb, said they attacked the student leaders and, when they fled,
set their car ablaze.
   Foreign journalists who watched the scene said the car had
government license tags, a target of students who have burned and
stoned several cars and state-owned buses in the past 10 days.
   The students have been particularly enraged by the sleek
Mercedes Benz cars that the government provides for Cabinet
ministers despite a 10-year recession that has brought salary cuts,
unemployment and lowered living standards.
   The state student movement leader, Keita Aboubacar, was beaten
by about 50 students at the main suburban campus when he carried
news of the government price cuts, students involved in the attack
said Wednesday.
   They said the student leader had to be treated at the hospital
Tuesday night, but he later denied to reporters there was any
attack on himself or members of his movement. He said two foreign
reporters who reported seeing a burning car belonging to a movement
official had lied.
   However, a militant protester, said, ``This is our response to
their efforts to pacify us. We're going to carry on demonstrating.''
   The government said Wednesday it was transferring the
responsibilities for secondary and higher education from Bella
Keita to Alhassane N'Diaye, the minister of culture and scientific
research.
   Militant students have demanded Keita's removal. Communications
Minister Auguste Miremont told reporters no reason was given for
the Cabinet reshuffle.
   Students said they also were angered by government proposals
this week to introduce more of the austerity measures that have
brought hardship to this once-prosperous nation. The Ivory Coast is
suffering from slumping prices of cocoa and coffee, its main
exports.
   President Felix Houphouet-Boigny told a meeting of worker and
employer organizations Monday that he proposes to cut the salaries
of government employees, including Cabinet ministers, by 15 percent
to 40 percent and tax all wage earners an additional 10 percent.
   He also proposed a 20 percent reduction in electricity charges
and up to 15 percent cuts in water bills.
   The president, whose civilian government has ruled since the
nation became independent from France in 1960, has met unexpected
opposition from the state-run General Union of Workers, a usually
docile body.
   Union leader Adiko Gniamke said at Monday's meeting that workers
could not support further salary cuts.
   Instead, he demanded the return of millions of dollars he said
had been deposited abroad by high-ranking dignitaries.
   The same demand has been made by the student protesters and the
Union of University Lecturers, the only body that has publicly
expressed support for the rebellious students.

   Firefighters on Wednesday finally
extinguished a blaze at a dump where 14 million old tires had
burned for 17 days, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the
smoky fumes, the fire chief announced.
   ``It's out, man, it's history,'' said Buck Slote, chief of the
volunteer Hagersville fire department.
   ``We're going to spend about a week out there cleaning up and
then we're going to have one hell of a party right here in the fire
hall.''
   The fire, believed set by an arsonist, began on Feb. 12 at the
Tyre King Recycling dump, forcing people to leave their homes in
the area 22 miles southwest of Hamilton and about 150 miles east of
Detroit. Most have since returned home.
   Slote, 51, fought the blaze alongside his son Cary and other
members of the 30-man volunteer force, plus firefighters from 24
other departments.
   He said he rushed to the 11-acre dump in the twilight after
hearing a radio report the fire was out.
   What did he see?
   ``I saw nothing. It was beautiful.''
   In frigid temperatures, pelted by snow and ice storms, the
firefighters had fought the blaze into a third week before claiming
victory.
   They used breathing apparatus to stand up to choking smoke,
broke a huge mountain of tires into smaller piles and bombed the
flames from the air with water mixed with a chemical fire
retardant. Most days, the water bombers were grounded by bad
weather and the firefighters on the ground had to go it alone.
   The tire dump, Ontario's largest, was declared an illegal waste
site in December 1985.
   Groundwater and soil contamination were major concerns, but
spokesman Gerry Merchant of the Ontario Environment Ministry said
107 of 125 tested wells in the area showed no contamination.
   He also said an air-quality monitoring system near the dump had
registered only slight chemical contamination.
   However, officials still cautioned farmers to keep livestock
away from drinking water in a nearby creek.
   Douglas Kittle, regional health officer, said initial test
results were reassuring.
   But residents were still worried about long-term environmental
damage.
   ``How ... can all that stuff go into the ground and not cause
problems?'' asked Don Davidson, a 32-year-old farmer.

<TEXT>
   The father of a 7-year-old girl
he has not seen in more than two years arrived here Thursday to
renew a court battle for custody of the child, whose mother went to
jail for hiding her.
   Dr. Erich Foretich flew into Christchurch from Auckland and said
he will abide by the New Zealand Family Court ruling not to see his
daughter, Hilary.
   Hilary's mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, has accused her former
husband of sexually abusing the child, a charge Foretich has denied.
   Foretich, a dentist from Falls Church, Va., would not respond to
the allegations Thursday, but said he would strive to keep Hilary's
privacy and dignity.
   ``I'm not going to get involved in scintillation and
retaliation,'' he told reporters at Christchurch airport before
being whisked into a waiting car and driven through the city with
media vehicles in pursuit.
   Hilary reportedly has not seen either parent for two years.
   No date has been set for the custody hearing, and Morgan still
is awaiting a Superior Court ruling in Washington, D.C., to regain
her passport, confiscated when she went to jail in August 1987 for
refusing to disclose Hilary's whereabouts.
   Morgan sent the child off with her parents after a Washington
judge ruled that Foretich could have unsupervised visits with
Hilary.
   Morgan spent 25 months in jail and was released only after
Congress passed a law tailored for her that limited imprisonment
for civil contempt to one year.
   Foretich, aided by private investigators, tracked his daughter
to Christchuch, a South Island city of 300,000 people 190 miles
south of Wellington.
   Foreign journalists have descended on the city since he arrived
in Australia on Monday, and Hilary's grandmother, Antonia Morgan,
said the child was feeling ``haunted'' by the battery of
photographers and journalists.
   The Family Court, which is to rule on the case, has warned
journalists they could be fined or jailed if they publish details
of the custody saga.
   New Zealand's contempt of court laws are much tougher than U.S.
laws and bar any discussion of a case before its conclusion.

   A banker who was indicted on racketeering
charges with Imelda Marcos, the widow of deposed Philippine leader
Ferdinand Marcos, pleaded guilty Wednesday to a lesser charge and
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
   The plea by Rodolfo T. Arambulo came just hours after the judge
declined to dismiss the indictment against Mrs. Marcos on a claim
she and her husband were abducted from their homeland by U.S.
officials during his overthrow in February 1986.
   Arambulo, 57, was the former president of the California
Overseas Bank, a Los Angeles-based bank indicted with Arambulo and
the Marcoses in October 1988.
   Arambulo, who had been a fugitive until his surrender Monday to
FBI agents in New York, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy
to commit mail fraud.
   He was accused of taking part in a scheme to fraudulently obtain
insurance from the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corp. for the
California Overseas Bank, which prosecutors say was secretly owned
by Marcos.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan revealed at the hearing that
Arambulo had signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella declined to say whether
Arambulo would be called as a witness at Mrs. Marcos' trial, which
is scheduled to start March 20. But the plea agreement said he
would be required to testify at proceedings related to the case.
   The conspiracy charge against Arambulo has a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He originally was charged
with racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, which both carry
maximum sentences of 20 years in prison.
   In his ruling on Mrs. Marcos' case, Keenan also refused to hold
an evidentiary hearing on the abduction allegation.
   Keenan noted that an entourage of 122 people accompanied the
couple when they left the Philippines for their home of exile in
Hawaii in February 1986, when Marcos was toppled in a revolution.
   ``This was more akin to a troop movement than a kidnapping,''
the judge said in a written opinion of their departure.
   The October 1988 indictment accused the Marcoses of siphoning
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy
Manhattan real estate and art. They also were charged with
embezzling $165 million from several banks.
   Marcos died in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   In his decision, Keenan outlined Mrs. Marcos' account of events
that led to the couple's arrival in Hawaii on Feb. 26, 1986, after
weeks of escalating anti-Marcos sentiment in the Philippines,
including attacks by rebels on the presidential palace.
   The judge said Mrs. Marcos claimed that at no time did she agree
to leave the country. She said she refused an offer of ``safe
haven'' in the United States made to her by then-first lady Nancy
Reagan in a telephone conversation shortly before the Marcoses left
the Philippines.
   Mrs. Marcos said she believed U.S. officials were going to
escort them to her husband's native province in the Philippines and
that she had no idea they were being taken to Hawaii.
   In rejecting the kidnapping claim, Keenan quoted a press
statement by Marcos two days after their arrival in Hawaii in which
Marcos said he was there ``under the hospitality'' of the U.S.
government and that he and his wife were ``treated with the utmost
respect and generosity.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds CIA Agreement With Author Frank Snepp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday upheld
an agreement that forces a former CIA agent to get permission from
the agency before publishing a manuscript about his experiences in
Vietnam.
   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
upheld a lower court judge who refused to modify a permanent
injunction against Frank W. Snepp III.
   Snepp, a CIA agent in Vietnam for eight years, resigned from the
agency and in 1977 published ``Decent Interval,'' a book about his
experiences.
   The federal government sued Snepp for violating an employment
agreement to submit all writings in advance to the CIA. In 1980,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the agency.
   Since then, Snepp and the CIA have agreed on publication of 18
manuscripts of books and other works by Snepp.
   The latest lawsuit arose out of a disagreement over Snepp's
plans to write a script for a television miniseries on his
experiences in Vietnam.
   After prolonged negotiations, the CIA approved the script but
the television deal had already fallen through. Snepp sued to
modify the injunction to place the burden on the CIA to initiate
judicial proceedings if he and the agency could not agree on a
manuscript.
   The appeals panel agreed with U.S. District Judge James C.
Cacheris of Alexandria that Snepp was trying to alter the 1980
Supreme Court ruling.
   ``He is essentially arguing that the original decision in his
case should have placed the burden on the CIA to see judicial
review. Reasserting the merits of his case does not, however,
justify altering an injunction,'' the appeals court said.

<HEAD>Report: Former President to Campaign for East German Centrists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan will visit East
Berlin to campaign for a coalition of centrist political parties
two days before East Germany's March 18 elections, the official ADN
news agency reported Wednesday.
   ADN said Reagan offered to make a campaign appearance for the
German Forum Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Free Democrats,
and that the coalition had ``replied positively.''
   But a Reagan spokeswoman, Cathy Goldberg, said Wednesday of the
ADN report: ``As of today, he has nothing on his schedule'' showing
a visit to Germany. Reagan attended a GOP event Wednesday for U.S.
Sen. Pete Wilson in San Diego.
   ADN said Reagan would address a final election rally on March 16
for the Alliance of Free Democrats, as the centrist coalition is
known. It provided no other details.
   The Alliance of Free Democrats currently is trailing the Social
Democratic Party and the conservative coalition supported by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Top West German politicians have been appearing at campaign
rallies for the parties they support in East Germany's first free
elections, which will choose a 400-member parliament.
   But the announcement of Reagan's planned visit was the first
indication that prominent U.S. politicians would become involved.
   Reagan visited West Berlin as president on June 12, 1987, and
made a dramatic appeal before the Berlin Wall for East German and
Soviet authorities to tear it down.
   The Berlin Wall was opened up in November during the peaceful
revolution that overthrew communist rule.

   Alaska officials expressed relief
Wednesday that a proposed federal plea bargain fell through and
Exxon Corp. was indicted on criminal charges in the nation's worst
oil spill.
   ``I was tremendously relieved because I was worried that we were
going to see some settlement that wasn't in the interests of
Alaska,'' said state Rep. David Finkelstein of Anchorage.
   The state lobbied the U.S. Justice Department to reject the plea
bargain with Exxon, saying it would hurt Alaska's efforts to win
civil damages from the multibillion-dollar oil company.
   ``We felt the proposed plea bargain did affect our civil
litigation, and we squawked about it,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said.
   Cowper said it appeared from the five-count indictment issued
Tuesday that the federal government was ``throwing the book at
Exxon, and I think that is probably appropriate.''
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Tuesday that the plea
bargain fell through because of state officials' objections and
because of Exxon's unwillingness to meet the government's terms.
   Several state officials alleged the plea negotiations were part
of an attempt by the Bush administration and Exxon to limit the oil
company's exposure to large criminal fines.
   ``Exxon has a very powerful influence. They're very powerful in
the economic clout they carry in Washington, D.C., as well as in
Juneau. It doesn't surprise me that they attempted to do an end
run,'' Sen. Jay Kerttula, whose district includes part of
oil-fouled Prince William Sound, said Wednesday.
   Sen. Mike Szymanski of Anchorage said it appeared the
administration was ``trying to cut a deal and let Exxon at least
evade the criminal prosecution, which would then save them on the
civil side.''
   While the federal government has handled the criminal case, the
state has focused on civil claims stemming from the spill. The
state also is prosecuting former tanker skipper Joseph Hazelwood on
felony criminal mischief and other charges stemming from the spill.
   The New York Times, in its Thursday editions, quoted
unidentified Justice Department officials as saying the
department's attempt to reach a plea bargain was motivated largely
by the desire to avoid a long trial it might lose. The officials
said they face a difficult court battle to convict Exxon, and said
the government remains open to the possibility of a negotiated
settlement, the newspaper reported.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
North Slope crude in the sound March 24, killing countless birds
and marine mammals and disrupting Alaska's lucrative fisheries.
   Under the proposed plea bargain, the federal government would
have abandoned its commitment to help the state in its civil
litigation, state Attorney General Douglas Baily said.
   State officials also criticized the Justice Department for the
secrecy surrounding the plea negotiations. Rep. Gene Kubina of
Valdez said the indictment ensures the criminal case will be heard
in public.
   Finkelstein said it was in Exxon's best interest to reach a plea
bargain privately before the indictment was filed. ``Now I think
it's much less likely that a settlement will occur in a form that
would hurt Alaska,'' he said.
   Exxon faces more than $700 million in possible penalties if
convicted. The money would go into the federal treasury, but
federal law gives the judge discretion to order restoration of the
environment.
   State officials said any money from the case should go to
restore the environment of the sound and the Gulf of Alaska to the
condition it was in before the spill.
   ``The money shouldn't just go into the federal treasury,'' said
Sen. Fred Zharoff of Kodiak. ``I think we ought to be looking at
ways and means of protecting the resources.''
   Szymanski maintained the federal government has an obligation to
help restore the environment and improve the Coast Guard's
monitoring of tanker traffic out of Valdez.
   State officials said large penalties are needed to ensure Exxon
and other oil shippers take the precautions necessary to prevent
oil spills.
   ``When you get up there close to a billion dollars, it's bound
to get their attention,'' House Speaker Sam Cotten said.

   A bill that would ban most abortions in
Minnesota failed to get past a state Senate committee Wednesday,
but the author refused to concede defeat.
   The bill, which would prohibit abortions for ``birth-control
reasons,'' was drafted as model legislation by the National
Right-To-Life Committee in the wake of last summer's U.S. Supreme
Court decision that gave states more leeway to restrict abortions.
   ``A bill is always alive as long as the session is on,'' said
Democratic Sen. Gene Waldorf after his bill failed on a tie vote in
the 16-member Senate Health and Human Services Committee.
   ``A bill has been resurrected before,'' Waldorf said.
``Committee defeat is not the end of action on a bill.''
   The vote followed nearly six hours of testimony from state and
national leaders on both sides of the abortion debate.
   Although Minnesota was long associated in national politics with
the liberalism espoused by former Vice President Walter Mondale, an
abortion rights supporter, it has been a stronghold of
anti-abortion sentiment.
   As the lawmakers debated, nearly 2,000 pro-choice activists
chanting ``Choice'' exchanged taunts outside the Capitol with a
small group of abortion foes shouting ``Life.'' No arrests were
made.
   Proponents say the legislation would be the toughest enforceable
anti-abortion measure in the nation, prohibiting an estimated 93
percent of the abortions performed in the state.
   ``Those who want this bill to become law impugn the moral
dignity of Minnesota's women,'' Kate Michelman, executive director
of the National Abortion Rights Action League, told a rally
Wednesday morning before the bill was taken up by the Senate
committee.
   ``They are implying that you cannot be trusted to make these
decisions.''
   Also Wednesday, lawmakers in Annapolis, Md., conducted a hearing
on four abortion restriction bills and one pro-choice bill. The
hearing attracted an overflow crowd that left about 150 people,
mostly abortion opponents, standing with protest signs outside a
legislative building.
   In Minnesota, Waldorf tried unsuccessfully to have the measure
taken up in the House first. He had predicted the bill would lose
on a tie vote in the Senate committee because the committee had
been ``stacked'' against the bill by Majority Leader Roger Moe, who
supports abortion rights.
   The House Health and Human Services Committee held hearings on
the anti-abortion measure Tuesday and Wednesday and is to debate it
Friday.
   As the Senate hearing opened, Waldorf told the committee: ``We
are deciding who shall live and who shall die; who does and who
does not belong to the community of legal protection.''
   Jackie Schwietz, co-executive director of Minnesota Citizens
Concerned for Life, said the abortion debate should not center on a
woman's right to choose.
   ``The question is not who decides but who gets killed,'' she
said.
   But opponents said the bill clearly violated U.S. Supreme Court
decisions, including the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which
legalized abortion and last summer's so-called Webster decision
which allowed states to impose some restrictions on abortions.
   The bill's provisions ``blatantly and unquestionably are
unconstitutional in their entirety,'' said Suzanna Sherry,
professor of constitutional law at the University of Minnesota.
   The author of the House bill, Democratic Rep. Steve Wenzel, said
he's almost certain the measure will be approved by the House
committee. House Democratic leaders, however, had indicated it was
possible no vote would occur in the House committee if the bill
were defeated by the Senate committee or if the senators did not
vote.
   Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich, considered an ally by abortion
opponents, has said he would sign whatever abortion legislation
reached his desk if it were approved of by both House and Senate
Democratic leaders.
   But Democratic leaders are split on the issue.
   The measure would allow abortions only in these cases:
   _ rape reported to police within 48 hours of the attack;
   _ incest reported to authorities before the abortion;
   _ pregnancy that threatens the woman's life or endangers her
health;
   _ pregnancy that would result in a child born with ``profound
and iremediable physical or mental disabilities incompatible with
sustained survival.''
   It also would establish a system of civil penalties for those
performing abortions and would set out requirements for informing
pregnant women about the consequences of abortion.

   The Soviet Union, with strong backing from the
United States, played an effective behind-the-scenes role in
encouraging Nicaragua's leftist government to hold an honest
election last Sunday, a senior official says.
   The official listed the Soviet role among a number of key
elements which persuaded the Sandinista authorities that free
elections were their best hope for obtaining legitimacy and
international economic support.
   The source spoke to reporters Tuesday after President Bush
conferred with congressional leaders about his plans for a
``significant and meaningful'' assistance program for Nicaragua in
the approaching post-Sandinista era. President-elect Violeta
Chamorro takes office April 25.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said aid for Nicaragua probably would run
into hundreds of millions of dollars over five years, and he
suggested the creation of an ``emerging democracy account'' to help
Nicaragua, Panama and the East European countries.

   The Contra rebels are refusing to
heed a call from Nicaraguan leaders and the Honduran president to
disband immediately, saying they'll wait until the newly elected
government in Managua takes office.
   Dismantling the U.S.-backed force has emerged as a critical
element in a peaceful transition in Nicaragua following the
opposition's stunning electoral triumph Sunday over the leftist
Sandinistas.
   On Tuesday, both Sandinista President Daniel Ortega and the
opposition president-elect, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, said the
rebels must immediately disband.
   ``The causes that started the civil war in Nicaragua have
disappeared,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a radio broadcast Tuesday
night. ``That's why those who took to the hills should now lay down
their guns and return peacefully to Nicaragua with their families
to work for the reconstruction of our motherland.''

   The Exxon Corp. faces criminal charges and
$700 million or more in possible penalties from last year's tanker
spill that left hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline polluted with
oil.
   A federal grand jury in Alaska brought a five-count indictment
against the giant oil company and its shipping subsidiary on
Tuesday, charging it violated a number of federal laws in
connection with the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   ``The indictment ... represents our best shot at prosecuting
this incident,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in
announcing the indictment.
   The massive spill occurred when the huge tanker veered off
course in Prince William Sound and struck a reef on March 24, 1989,
spilling 11 million gallons of crude. It was the worst oil
catastrophe in U.S. history and caused widespread damage to
wildlife and Alaska's ecology.

   Northrop Corp., under investigation for fraud
in its stealth bomber program, admitted falsifying test data on
parts for two other projects _ the cruise missile and Harrier jet _
and agreed to a $17 million fine.
   The defense contractor Tuesday pleaded guilty to 34 counts of
making false statements to the government. In exchange, the
government agreed to drop 139 other counts of making false
statements and two counts of conspiracy.
   ``This is a very significant victory in our efforts to combat
defense contracting fraud and misconduct,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
William F. Fahey said.
   The fine will be ``a tremendous deterrent to corporations who
choose to cut corners on certifications of tests on significant

   In its defense, Northrop said the military services using the
AV-8B Harrier attack jet and the cruise missile had reported that
``both systems have performed satisfactorily in flight operations.''

<TEXT>
   To the frustration of the Democratic
governors' campaign chairman, President Bush seems beyond the reach
of ordinary politicians, ``out there in his own medium at a
distance from all the rest of us.''
   If that's so, Democratic governors helped him get there.
   There are 29 of them, outnumbering the 21 Republicans, but that
opposition majority didn't show at the National Governors'
Association this week. In the antiseptic political atmosphere of
those conferences, the very idea that a Democratic governor _ Roy
Romer of Colorado _ was suggesting a budget challenge to the
Republican administration led Romer to raise a point of order.
   Gov. Richard F. Celeste's bemused complaint about the apparently
untouchable Republican president and his soaring approval ratings
came near the end of a four-day meeting dominated by bipartisan
embrace of an education reform program. The education goals were
put together by the governors and the White House. But politically,
the issue bears the Bush trademark.
   There was an undertone of Democratic dissatisfaction with the
president's education budget, complaints that the federal
investment he proposes doesn't come close to matching the rhetoric.
   Gov. Bill Clinton, D-Ark., a leader in the education reform
drive, said Bush should be alerting the voters that they are going
to have to pay more in local and state taxes to get results.
   ``I think that if he's not going to give us the money to do what
plainly costs more money, then he has to be very clear and
supportive of the governors in doing that at the state level,''
Clinton said.
   But at campaign time, governors who raise taxes, even for the
worthiest causes, are governors with a potential problem.
   As a candidate, Bush said he wanted to be known as the education
president. With few federal budget dollars to spare for new or
expanded programs, Bush went to the governors to propose that they
chart common goals for educational progress to be attained by the
year 2000. That led to the education summit Bush convened in
Charlottesville, Va., at the end of September.
   A task force of governors worked with the administration to
shape the reform goals, which Bush announced to the nation in his
State of the Union address. With minor changes, no dissent and
little debate, those goals were approved by the governors on Sunday.
   Then they went to the White House for dinner and a Bush toast:
   ``We come together not as Republicans and Democrats, not as
partisan competitors, but as fellow chief executives with our
hearts and minds focused on a single goal: the future of our kids,
the future of our country.''
   They went back the next day to meet with the president, then to
stand behind him as he praised their part in the first-ever
national education goals and objectives to ``pave the way for a
decade-long commitment to excellence in education for all
Americans.''
   But the questions of cost and of raising the money remain
unanswered. The goals are bipartisan, but the taxes it will take to
attain them will be guaranteed campaign issues.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus, D-Idaho, said none of it will work ``if he
provides the rhetoric and we have to provide the resources.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told the governors he doubted Bush
could be an education president ``by proposing a meager 2 percent
increase in federal spending on education.''
   The governors politely requested that part of any peace dividend
flowing from defense spending cuts be devoted to education. Romer
of Colorado wanted them to tell the president he should shift
``substantial federal resources'' from defense to education and
other needs, but they wouldn't go that far.
   And when a Republican governor suggested the vague language they
did adopt drew a line against Bush, Romer raised a point of order,
saying he was being misquoted.
   ``I didn't in any way say that I think we need to stand against
the president,'' he said.
   But the Democrats are, after all, the opposition party. And
consensus isn't likely to survive the election season. Thirty-six
states are electing governors this year. Education and taxes will
be among the issues in almost every state campaign, and Bush will
be involved in some.
   Ohio Gov. Celeste, chairman of the Democratic Governors'
Association, said the Bush White House is adept at boosting
Republican candidates by helping them raise funds and mobilize
party workers.
   ``This is one very politically smart White House,'' said
Celeste. ``...I can understand why George Bush dominates an arena
in which we are all sort of bit players.''
   He said Democratic campaigners will find effective ways to
counter Bush. ``We would underestimate the president at our own
peril,'' Celeste said.

<HEAD>Why You Get Those `Pre-Approved' Credit Card Applications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you already have a half-dozen credit cards
and hardly use them, you're probably wondering why more banks are
beseeching you to apply for theirs.
   Many use sales pitches that include waived annual fees, 24-hour
card- replacement protection, instant $5,000 cash-advance limits,
``pre-approved'' applications and bonuses that range from free
travel to car rental discounts. This aggressive marketing to peddle
credit cards may seem even more curious in view of rising default
rates for many types of loans, a growing number of debt-troubled
banks, a record number of bankruptcies and a slowly emerging
backlash against the 1980s era of spending borrowed money.
   Credit cards, nonetheless, remain one of the most profitable
segments of the banking industry. The percentage of late payments
remains relatively low and actually has declined compared with some
years ago, industry experts say.
   Moreover, interest charges on many credit cards exceed 18
percent, much higher than most other types of consumer loans,
making them even more attractive to an industry struggling to find
new ways of making money.
   ``People who said the credit card market was saturated 3 or 4 or
5 years ago probably had to swallow a good bit of that crow,'' said
Bruce Brittain, head of Britain Associates Inc., an Atlanta-based
marketing strategy consultant that researches credit card use.
   Even a few new credit cards _ Discover from Sears and and Optima
from American Express _ have muscled into millions of wallets.
There also are indications that Japan is headed this way with the
JCB (Japan Credit Bureau) card, the most widely accepted plastic in
the East.
   There is no indication that credit card growth is leveling off.
Daniel Marx, program associate at Bankcard Holders of America, a
Washington-based consumer group, said outstanding debt on all types
of credit cards in 1989 totaled $182 billion, vs. $82 billion at
the beginning of the decade.
   Last year, 224 million Americans held the two most common types
of bank credit cards, Mastercard and Visa, vs. 120 million in 1980,
he said.
   Banking experts say a catalyst for this explosion is the ease
with which banks can obtain screening information about potential
customers, drastically lowering their cost of signing up
creditworthy users.
   Banks once went on what amounted to fishing expeditions, mailing
applications en masse. When the credit card business was in its
infancy, some banks simply sent the cards and hoped users would pay
their bills. Now, many banks first go to credit bureaus, which
routinely sell them computerized lists of names screened by age
group, income and debts.
   ``Banks can say, `I need the names of all males over 48 years
old who make more than $75,000 a year and have $15,000 of available
credit,''' Marx said.
   ``The computer will spit out this information for a price.
There's a lot of this that goes on. This is where you get your
pre-approved credit card. You fit into a niche that the banks have
drawn up.''
   This explains, for example, why a New Yorker who has several
cards may get a solicitation from a small bank in St. Louis to sign
up for its Visa or Mastercharge, or a Californian will get one from
an obscure bank in Delaware.
   What also has happened, many experts say, is that consumers have
acquired so many cards they are becoming more selective about which
ones they use. This has intensified the competition.
   ``A bank can't sit back anymore and wait for a customer to use
its card,'' said Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the American
Bankers Association, a Washington trade group of commercial banks.
``What the issuer has to do is make sure when you open your wallet,
you pull out its card, not someone else's.''
   Many credit card experts caution that users who are wondering
whether to sign up for new cards should carefully read the fine
print of their applications, especially regarding interest rates
and grace periods, which can vary widely. They also say the
``pre-approved'' enticement, in many cases, simply means your name
was culled from a pre-approved list.
   ``They're still going to check your credit,'' Brittain said.
``If they discover anything about you, you're still going to get
bounced.''
   Others say the net effect of the marketing assault on credit
card users is good, mostly because it reflects competition that is
providing more choices.
   ``We feel that frankly, it's an opportunity for the consumer to
shop,'' said Jay Muzychenko, vice president of the National
Foundation for Consumer Credit, a credit-counseling organization in
Silver Spring, Md.
   ``Our position is that, bottom line, you don't have to take the
cards just because they're offered.''

<TEXT>
   When Bertrand Blier develops a screenplay, he
writes with specific people in mind. Since the French filmmaker's
stories are usually a little crazy, he wants his actors the same
way.
   ``I need an interesting starting point,'' said the director of
the certifiably insane ``Too Beautiful for You'' (``Trop Belle Pour
Toi''), which won the Jury's Special Prize last summer at Cannes,
and ``Get Out Your Handkerchiefs'' (``Preparez Vos Mouchoirs''),
winner in 1978 of the Academy Award for best foreign film.
   ``To have the movie start with something crazy, you need the
sort of actors that are crazy enough themselves to make it
credible,'' he said.
   Good actors, the director insists, are a little deranged, like
his friend Gerard Depardieu, the star of ``Too Beautiful for You''
and ``Get Out Your Handkerchiefs'' as well as Blier's ``Menage''
and ``Cold Cuts'' (``Buffet Froid'').
   They met in 1973, when Blier was casting for ``Going Places''
(``Les Valseuses'') and Depardieu was an unknown actor.
   ``I was a little hesitant to hire him because that was a very
important charatcer in the film,'' Blier recalled. ``For six
months, every day, Depardieu would come to the office with a
different costume on to convince me he could play different
characters. One day, he was very funny. The next day he was sad and
distraught. It's extraordinary.''
   Depardieu got the part and Blier gave him the chance to make
good on the promise of his extended audition _ to do anything.
   In ``Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,'' Depardieu decides his unhappy
wife needs a lover and recruits a total stranger for the job _ in
the middle of a restaurant. In ``Cold Cuts,'' he plays an
unemployed man who accosts a stranger in a subway station and rants
about his dreams of murder. In ``Menage,'' he is a thief who again
inflicts himself on total strangers and takes over their lives.
   The films are in the spirit of those screwball comedies of the
1930s, such as ``My Man Godfrey'' and ``The Thin Man.'' Timing is
essential, quick enough to make audiences laugh, but not so fast
that the story loses believability. And no matter how warped the
humor gets, the actors have to play it straight.
   ``Each film is like a game,'' Blier explained. ``With each new
movie you have to set your rules and you have to explain your rules
to the public if you want them to be able to play with you.''
   He admires American director Billy Wilder, who depended on
actors such as Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau to hustle along the
story. Blier says Depardieu is ideal for that kind of comedy
because he's quicker than other actors.
   ``The entire movie just goes a lot faster,'' Blier said. ``Even
in a love scene, everything goes very fast. The other actors, even
the very good ones, they tend to listen to what they're saying,
contemplate themselves. He doesn't do that.''
   With ``Too Beautiful for You,'' imagine ``She-Devil'' with the
husband abandoning Meryl Streep and running off with Roseanne Barr.
Depardieu is a respectable upper-class family man who falls in love
with his homely secretary (Josiane Balasko) while spurning his
beautiful wife (Carole Bouquet).
   Blier noted that ``Too Beautiful for You'' was harder to shoot
than his earlier films because there was less action and more
emphasis on affairs of the heart. Deparidieu, reluctantly, had to
slow down.
   ``Depardieu was feeling rather uneasy when they were shooting
the movie because he was under the impression that he had nothing
to do. He likes to act, he prefers to act. He's always looking at
the women and doing nothing. When he wanted to do something, I
said, `No, don't move, only look.'''
   Blier, the son of actor Bernard Blier, was born in 1939 in
Paris. Through his father, Blier met French directors Henri-Georges
Clouzot and Jacques Becker and soon decided he wanted to make
films, too.
   ``I was 15, 16, and it came to my mind that that was the only
profession for me,'' Blier said. ``It's the only profession where
you take yourself for God, pretend you're God for a while.''
   His first commandment remains ``Thou Shalt Be Insane,'' and no
exceptions are allowed. One poor actor was even banished for signs
of excessive normal behavior.
   ``The first scene of `Buffet Froid' was very difficult for me
because I shot the scene with another actor, who was not Michel
Serrault, and it was a disaster,'' Blier said.
   ``I called Michel Serrault and he came for two nights to shoot
his scene. Only Michel Serrault was crazy enough for the beginning
of this film. I can't work with actors who are not like that.''

Challenges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years after the march to
Montgomery, Selma's blacks and whites, still separated socially,
are nearing political equality _ and are at the barricades of
protest again.
   The goal of the black demonstrators a quarter-century ago was
clearcut and fundamental: gaining the right to vote.
   The March 7, 1965, assault on the protesters by Alabama state
troopers and other lawmen _ a clash known in civil rights annals as
Bloody Sunday _ generated widespread support for the march and for
the passage of the Voting Rights Act, which ensured blacks no
longer would be denied voting rights through chicanery or
intimidation.
   Today's protesters use the same '60s-style tactics of marches
and sit-ins, but their targets are narrower: political control of
Selma's school system and stopping the impending ouster of the
city's first black school superintendent.
   Organizers planned a re-enactment Sunday of the 54-mile march to
the Capitol in Montgomery, with participants including the Rev.
Jesse Jackson; the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference; and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a
former leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
   Lowery heads the Atlanta-based organization founded by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., who led the second march that reached
Montgomery guarded by federal troops two weeks later. Lewis led the
hundreds of demonstrators to Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody
Sunday, suffering a bloodied head for his efforts.
   Lewis isn't the only familiar face returning from 1965.
   City Council President Carl Morgan and Mayor Joe Smitherman held
those same posts 25 years ago, when Selma, now about 53 percent
black, had no black public officials. Blacks now hold four of the
nine City Council seats and three of five Dallas County Commission
seats.
   Smitherman and Morgan are quick to list other milestones of
racial progress: A district judge is black, as is an assistant
police chief and the president of Wallace Community College. A
black also has served as president of the embattled city school
board, an 11-member appointive body with five black members.
   ``A lot of things have changed,'' Morgan said. ``There's no
question about that. ... You've got a black state senator and two
black state representatives that represent the district Selma is
in.''
   A new congressional district with a black majority could be
carved out of central Alabama after the census is completed, giving
the state its first black congressman this century.
   But Selma's black and white residents still live largely in
separate neighborhoods, and tend not to socialize.
   A white former city councilman, George ``Cap'' Swift, noted, for
example, that the city has two Elks Clubs, two American Legion
Posts and two First Baptist churches _ one for each race.
   Morgan sees an ulterior motive in the current controversy
engulfing Selma, which involves the white-majority school board's
refusal to renew the three-year contract of Superintendent Norward
Roussell at the end of this school year.
   ``If that situation had not come up, something else probably
would have to focus on the 25th anniversary of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act,'' said Morgan, a colonel in the Alabama National Guard
when it was federalized to help protect the marchers.
   The view of a manufactured controversy to coincide with the
anniversary is strongly disputed by Rose Sanders, a leader of the
protests, which have included sit-ins at City Hall and at the only
public high school.
   Mrs. Sanders said today's protests are designed to make sure
black children aren't segregated through an unfair student
placement system. Such a system had been used before Roussell began
trying to dismantle it, she said.
   ``Blacks and whites go in the same school door, but once inside
they go to separate and unequal classes,'' said Mrs. Sanders, like
her husband, state Sen. Hank Sanders, a Harvard-educated lawyer.
   Smitherman contends Mrs. Sanders and the protesters are trying
to segregate the schools. The 5,800-student system was 70 percent
black before the protests began; with more than 250 whites
withdrawing in recent weeks, it now is 75 percent black.
   Feelings against the protesters of 25 years ago remain strong,
too, at least in some quarters.
   Sol Tepper Sr., a member of then-Dallas County Sheriff Jim
Clark's posse, which tangled with the demonstrators, voiced a
perspective on the Bloody Sunday clash that he says isn't unique.
   ``The media made criminals out of law-enforcement officials who
were only trying to enforce the laws of the land,'' said Tepper,
81, a wealthy landowner. They ``made heroes out of a bunch of
vermin, lawbreakers who descended on us like plagues out of
Egypt,'' he said.
   Feelings also run high about the failure of an all-black and a
bi-racial committee to work together to prepare for the march
re-enactment, scheduled to end Saturday in Montgomery, and the
commemoration of the Voting Rights Act's passage.
   A white banker, Rex Morthland, was co-chairman of the bi-racial
committee commemorating the march. His co-chairman was Selma High
School Principal F.D. Reese, the black who invited King to lead
demonstrations in the city.
   But the panel disbanded after Morthland said he could not get
cooperation from the all-black committee, which has celebrated the
voting rights march in past years.
   Mrs. Sanders, a leader of the all-black group, dismissed the
bi-racial committee as a ``tool of the mayor.''
   Last week, the white-majority City Council refused to repave
Martin Luther King Jr. Street for the 25th anniversary of the
march, with the 5-4 vote falling along racial lines.
   Still, Morthland said, the years have brought improvement.
   ``They were tense in 1965 and they're tense now, too, but in the
intervening period I think a great deal of progress has been made
in racial relations in the city,'' he said.
   That might partly be due to a more assertive attitude on the
part of blacks.
   ``We're a different breed than we were in the '60s,'' Dr. Samuel
Lett, an obstetrician with a high profile in recent Selma protests,
told blacks attending a mass meeting. ``We took things then that we
won't take now.''

   A look at the South's political corridors
before and after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act reveals
dramatic gains by blacks, but it was only a first step toward black
electoral victories.
   In Alabama, it took a massive but mostly unheralded court case,
launched in Mobile in the late 1970s, to restructure scores of
local governments that had used at-large election systems to
effectively bar blacks from office.
   The Voting Rights Act eliminated the voter registration
roadblocks, candidate qualification rules and other discriminatory
practices that kept elected offices tantalizingly out of reach for
blacks.
   But it wasn't until the U.S. Senate extended the act in 1982
that language was included protecting minorities from election laws
with discriminatory effects, even if their initial intent was not.
   Without having to prove intentional discrimination, civil rights
lawyers were able to attack the at-large election systems that
diluted black voting strength in cities and counties where blacks
were the minority of the population.
   The litigation was based largely on the Mobile case, styled
Bolden vs. City of Mobile, which led to a ruling mandating the
dismantling of the city's commission form of government, the
members of which were elected at-large. It was replaced with a
seven-member council elected by districts, including at least three
black-majority districts.
   By 1988, the use of at-large elections had all but disappeared
in Alabama, with court action ``the most crucial mechanism for
change,'' said historian Peyton McCrary, who studied the Voting
Right Act's impact on Alabama and other Southern states.
   Another historian, Chandler Davidson of Rice University, has
called it a ``Second Reconstruction.''
   As late as 1979, Alabama's 400 municipalities had only 94 black
city council members, according to the Alabama Democratic
Conference, the party's black political caucus.
   But with the advent of the change-of-government litigation, the
number had climbed by 1989 to 410 black council members, nearly
one-fifth of all council seats, the group said. The state is
slightly more than one-fourth black.
   Only a handful of Alabama's 67 counties still use at-large
elections to pick commission members, most in locales with small
percentages of blacks.
   ``Once blacks and whites get on these governing boards and have
to work together, over time, they begin to become friends,'' said
Jerome Gray, field director for the black caucus.
   But voters still split along racial lines when they go to the
polls, said historian Robert J. Norrell of the University of
Alabama.
   ``People can still win elections by appealing only to one
race,'' said Norrell, author of a book on the civil rights movement
in Tuskegee.
   David Ruffin, editor of Focus magazine, the monthly public
policy magazine of the Joint Center for Political Studies in
Washington, D.C., puts the Voting Rights Act in the context of the
200-year-old civil rights struggle.
   ``It's the 200-year process of extending the franchise to every
American,'' he said. ``This is one more step.''
   Ruffin said Sunday's planned re-enactment of the
Selma-to-Montgomery march is part of the continuing process of
political change.
   ``The whole reason we were out in the streets in the '60s was to
be part of the establishment,'' he said. ``Martin Luther King
wanted to join this great American enterprise. He wanted to be a
part of the establishment, so that black people could participate.''

<HEAD>Coca-Eating Caterpillars Old Hat for USDA Researchers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department can get secretive
over the darndest things sometimes. Costs of remodeling offices,
who's on the appointments calendars, where the secretary goes on
vacation, things like that.
   When it chooses, the deparment can ballyhoo with the the best of
'em. Annual yearbooks, new programs that don't cost much and White
House projects that require a rural ``spin'' by appropriate
agencies, for example.
   But there are some goings-on that often are kept under cover for
years, sometimes forever.
   So it wasn't really surprising that the USDA clammed up tighter
than a hound's jaws on a ham bone after The Washington Post
reported Feb. 20 that President Bush has asked for $6.5 million in
fiscal 1991 for the study of voracious caterpillars to kill coca
plants in South America.
   Coca leaves are the raw material from which cocaine is refined,
and the Bush administration says they are prime targets in the war
on drugs.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said no
``biological war'' was in the works. And Bolivia and Peru said that
while they wanted help in getting farmers to switch crops,
coca-eating worms are not wanted.
   It didn't take long for information lids to clang shut at USDA.
Nobody was talking about the department's coca-hungry caterpillars
and the experiments.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter declined to provide
further details but told reporters the experiments ``may send a
message to the drug lords'' about U.S. determination on the issue.
   The department issued a statement attributed to Assistant
Secretary Charles E. Hess, who oversees USDA's science and
education programs.
   Hess said the department, ``in full cooperation with other
agencies,'' has been involved in projects to eradicate ``plants
from which illicit drugs are derived.''
   Further, he said, ``These projects have not been publicized due
to the obvious need for security of personnel and facilities.
Accordingly, the department is not at liberty to comment on the
specifics of these programs.''
   The USDA has had considerable experience in clandestine
operations, such as the decades of involement with the military in
biological warfare projects during and after World War II. Such
U.S. weapons were banned in 1969.
   One two-volume report, which was removed from the secret list in
the late 1970s, showed that USDA's research in biological warfare
was concentrated ``on the anti-personnel aspects'' of war.
   ``There are also smaller programs in anti-animal and anti-crop
BW (biological warfare) as outgrowths of the World War II effort,''
the report said. ``The anti-animal program was closely linked to
the anti-personnel program since certain diseases produced effects
in humans and animals, and the scientific disciplines involved are
identical or very similar.''
   According to the old reports, ``The first limited BW retaliatory
capability was achieved in 1951 when an anti-crop bomb was
developed, tested and placed in production for the Air Force.''
   The first anti-animal test was conducted in July 1951 but was
discontinued three years later because it was concluded the program
``lacked military worth.''
   After sputtering a few times, the anti-crop program by 1969
included three biological agents: stem rust of wheat and rye and
rice blast.
   ``Between 1951 and 1957, wheat stem rust spores and rye stem
rust spores were produced from innoculated crops at planting sites
located on government installations,'' the report said. ``The
harvested spores were shipped to Edgwwood Arsenal, Md., for
classification, drying and storage. This operation was terminated
in 1959 by the Air Force.''
   However, that wasn't the end of the program to develop a wheat
rust weapon. Between 1962 and 1969, rust spores were grown again at
government sites, with the material shipped to the Rocky Mountain
Arsenal for processing and storage.
   All wheat rust spores were destroyed by February 1973, the
report said. Rice blast inventories, including final deliveries to
Fort Detrick, Md., were destroyed the previous year.
   The roots of biological weaponry such as coca-eating
caterpillars go back many years, at least to World War I.
   ``There is incontrovertible evidence, for example, that in 1915
German agents inoculated horses and cattle leaving United States
ports for shipment to the Allies with disease-producing bacteria,''
the report said.
   In World War II, a formal stamp was put onto U.S. efforts in the
summer of 1942 when the War Research Service was approved by
President Franklin Roosevelt.
   ``Appropriate liaison was maintained with the Armed Services,
the U.S. Public Health Service, the Department of Agriculture, and
the Department of Interior,'' the report said.

   The Justice Department announced a five-count
criminal indictment against Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary
over the Exxon Valdez oil spill that fouled Alaska's coast nearly a
year ago.
   ``The indictment returned today represents our best shot at
prosecuting this incident,'' Atorney General Dick Thornburgh said.
   If the giant oil company is convicted on all counts brought by a
federal grand jury in Anchorage, it could face criminal fines of as
much as $1.6 million, officials said. In addition, the government
could seek as much as $700 million more in penalties.
   In New York, Exxon chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said in a
statement, ``We will defend ourselves in court against these
charges. We believe there is no statutory basis for the amount of
the fines mentioned by the U.S. attorney general.''

   Creditors of Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
say they will oppose the company's plan to have its own directors
supervise the liquidation of the Wall Street powerhouse that
collapsed like a house of cards.
   Drexel asked a bankruptcy judge Tuesday to allow three of its
top executives, rather than a court-appointed examiner, manage the
liquidation of the company's securities subsidiary and other units.
   The move came as U.S. Trustee's office appointed a 17-member
committee to represent creditors in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings for Drexel, which sought bankruptcy protection Feb. 13.
after a cash crisis.
   But creditors said they would oppose the move, maintaining that
the executives who ran the company as it deteriorated in the last
year _ including Chairman John S.R. Shad _ should not oversee its
dismantling.
   ``I think it's the job of the creditors to have input into this
dissolution,'' said Sylvan Schefler, a former Drexel managing
director who quit six months ago after 30 years at the firm and who
was named to the creditors committee. Schefler and dozens of other
ex-Drexel workers are owed payment for stock holdings they were to
receive after leaving the firm.
   More than 300 creditors, Drexel shareholders and lawyers
attended the organizational meeting, at which Drexel chief
executive Frederick H. Joseph said the company was trying to
maximize the value of the assets.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage unit, and other
subsidiaries have liquidated more than 86 percent of their
multibillion-dollar securities portfolios and other assets since
the parent sought bankruptcy protection.
   ``We know we tried as hard as we could. We're terribly sorry to
be in this position,'' Joseph told the gathering. ``At this time
our job is to salvage as much value as possible.''
   Drexel chief financial officer Richard Wright said the firm's
total assets had been reduced to $6.9 billion from $28.6 billion at
the end of 1989, while liabilities had fallen to $6.2 billion from
$27.8 billion. Stockholders equity now is $700 million, down from
$844 million, he said.
   Drexel officials said the firm lost $65 million from Jan. 1
until the bankruptcy filing.
   Creditors said they would demand more information about Drexel's
past and present financial activities, especially the liquidation.
They also said they would seek to examine why Drexel's subsidiaries
were not placed into Chapter 7 liquidation proceedings, where a
court would monitor the dissolution.
   Many people involved in the case believe creditors will seek to
force Drexel into Chapter 7, where company management would have a
reduced role in the firm's break-up.
   ``What they've done is take the court out of play,'' said
attorney Stuart Hirshfield, who represents a major creditor on the
committee. ``They're created an environment in which everything's
going to have to be reviewed instead of checked out in advance.''
   Drexel attorneys asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold Buschman III
to give responsibility for selling assets of Drexel's subsidiaries
to the company's three-member oversight committee, created last
year as part of the firm's federal securities fraud settlement.
   The subsidiaries are not in Chapter 11 and therefore do not have
to report asset sales and other activity to the judge. But Drexel's
top unsecured creditors have questioned the rapid disbursement of
assets and other payments, including $260 million in cash and stock
bonuses paid to employees late last year.
   Drexel lawyers maintained that having the three-member committee
monitor the liquidation was not a conflict because company
executives, as stockholders in the parent, also are owed money and
want to maximize asset values.
   The committee would report directly to the judge and allow
creditors access to the process. The attorneys said placing an
outsider in charge would slow the process and endanger gaining
maximum value for the assets.
   First City Bancorp. has filed a motion asking the judge to
appoint an outside examiner to look into the company and its
dissolution. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday.
   The oversight committee consists of Shad, who is a former head
of the Securities and Exchange Commission; Roderick Hills, a
Washington lawyer and former SEC chairman; and Ralph Saul, chairman
of Peers &amp; Co. and a former American Stock Exchange president. All
three are Drexel board members.
   The panel was formed as part of a settlement with the SEC last
April in which Drexel overhauled its management and agreed to plead
guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million in penalties to settle
charges in the government's insider trading investigation.
   Drexel has fired almost 3,700 of its 5,380 employees. Drexel
officials said at the creditors meeting they expected to reduce the
staff to about 200 within one month.

   The head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said the
firm tried to rebound from its guilty plea to securities crimes and
a series of financial setbacks, but in the end: ``We failed.''
   In his first public comment since Drexel's parent filed for
bankruptcy protection, chief executive Frederick H. Joseph told a
meeting of creditors Tuesday that the firm's demise began with its
December 1988 decision to admit to six felonies and pay $650
million in penalties rather than face racketeering charges.
   ``We fought for a year,'' he said. ``We lost the battle.''
   Joseph blamed a declining investment environment, particularly
in the junk-bond field Drexel once commanded, for spurring the
financial crisis. He also appeared to blame federal regulators for
not forcing commercial banks to extend credit to the firm in its
dying days.
   Drexel's parent filed for Chapter 11 protection on Feb. 13 after
it defaulted on $100 million in short-term debt. The investment
bank already has fired about 3,700 of 5,400 employees and
liquidated most of its securities holdings as it closes down
operations.
   Joseph said the firm needed a bridge loan of $250 million to
$300 million to get through ``what appeared to us to be a 60-day
difficult period.'' As collateral, Drexel would have put up its
highly illiquid $1.1 billion portfolio of junk bonds.
   After discussions on the night of Feb. 12, Joseph said he
believed that Gerald Corrigan, head of the New York Federal Reserve
Board, was encouraging commercial banks to provide the loans.
   But in a 1 a.m. conference call hours later with Securities and
Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden and Treasury
Department officials, the government closed the window on Drexel,
saying it wouldn't bail out the firm or encourage anyone else to do
so.
   ``They saw no daylight here and felt the best thing for the
market and for Drexel creditors and shareholders would be to file a
Chapter (11) proceeding,'' Joseph said. The decision was approved
at a 6 a.m. Drexel board meeting on Feb. 13.
   Joseph said Drexel had managed to make $50 million in the first
half of 1989, largely from its underwriting of a record junk-bond
offering to finance the RJR Nabisco takeover. But then it was hit
with $160 million in write-offs from sour junk bond financings for
Integrated Resources Inc., which also has filed for bankruptcy
protection, and Paramount Petroleum Co.
   Drexel paid $500 million of its $650 million in government
penalties last September, when the junk bond market and Drexel's
large portfolio of the securities plummeted. Drexel lost $86
million in October alone, when the stock market plunged, including
$25 million in arbitrage trading in UAL Corp.
   In November the firm began experiencing problems meeting its
obligations on commercial paper, a form of short-term credit that
Drexel's parent relied upon. By January, the parent was taking
capital from the brokerage subsidiary to help repay its commercial
paper debt.
   Federal regulators stopped the drain because the brokerage's net
capital was approaching minumum requirements, and when bank
financing became unavailable, the Drexel party ended.
   Drexel lost $40 million last year and about $65 million in
January and February. Fees from investment banking had dried up.
The firm forced employees to take some of their compensation in
stock, but that failed to raise enough cash to stem the tide.
   ``We went throuygh the year, the difficulties piled up on us,''
Joseph said. ``It's clear that the end of the story is we didn't
make it. We failed.''

<HEAD>Ford Need to Solve Product Problems Earlier, Petersen Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has trouble bringing new
cars to market faster because it doesn't do a good enough job
solving problems early in the development process, the company's
outgoing chairman says.
   Donald Petersen, who retires Thursday after nearly 41 years with
the nation's No. 2 automaker, said Tuesday that Japanese companies
do a better job of solving problems early and, consequently, can
bring a new car to market faster.
   But, he added, there's a danger in that _ a blurring of the
distinctions between old and new models.
   ``We don't do a good enough job up front, early in the game,''
Petersen said. ``We make far too many changes.''
   On the other hand, he said, Japanese automakers make a decision
on a product and march forward, ruling out late-in-the-cycle
changes that could help sell the vehicle but also contribute to
delays. That speed creates its own problems, he said.
   ``The Japanese are changing their rate that isn't necessarily
doing them a lot of good,'' Petersen said. ``I don't think I'm
abnormal in my inability to identify one car from another.''
   One of the companies with an exceptionally quick product cycle
time is Honda Motor Co. Ltd. Yet its 1990 Accord, which Honda
advertises as an entirely new vehicle, has been criticized for not
being distinctive enough in look from earlier models.
   Although Ford has ties to Mazda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co.,
Petersen said he admired Toyota Motor Corp. more.
   ``They have a very complex product line,'' he said. ``They are a
very big company and sell in very high volume. There are others but
they are more limited in their product line.''
   Petersen became Ford's president in 1980, a year in which the
company lost $1.5 billion. He took over as chairman and chief
executive officer on Feb. 1, 1985.
   That year, the company reported $2.5 billion in profits and Ford
was on its way to setting an industry record of $5.3 billion in
earnings in 1988. Last year, the company made $3.84 billion. For
several of those years, Ford's earnings eclipsed those of General
Motors Corp., the nation's biggest automaker, for the first time
ever.
   Petersen's departure comes as the U.S. industry struggles to
hold down costs in a sluggish market, and that tries to hold on to
market share in the face of growing numbers of cars made by
Japanese companies overseas and in the United States.
   His successor, Vice Chairman Harold ``Red'' Poling, will be
faced with the same problems, but only for three years. He will
retire in 1993, and his likely successor will be Executive Vice
President Allan Gilmour.
   During the next 18 months, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith and
Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, a former Ford president, also
will step aside.

<HEAD>New Rule Will Bar Violators from Exchange Boards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of debate and comment, federal
regulators have voted to bar people who violate major commodity
futures exchange rules from serving on policy- and rule-making
panels.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted unanimously
Tuesday to approve a new regulation prohibiting rule violators from
serving on disciplinary committees, arbitration panels or governing
boards of exchanges or futures associations.
   The rule would bar violators for three years or for the length
of any sanction imposed against them by an exchange, whichever was
longer. It was first proposed by the CFTC staff in September.
   In other action, the CFTC approved an application by the New
York Mercantile Exchange to trade futures contracts in natural gas.
The contract is designed to allow gas producers, pipeline
companies, distributors and consumers to better determine prices
and hedge against price fluctuations.
   The new disciplinary rule is an outgrowth of congressional
hearings into the fraud scandals at the nation's two largest
commodity futures exchanges last summer in Chicago. Forty-eight
people were indicted on charges linked to allegations of fradulent
trading that surfaced in a two-year, undercover federal
investigation.
   A bill passed by the House and awaiting approval in the Senate
would require the CFTC, which oversees the futures industry, to
implement regulations barring major rule violators from sitting on
the disciplinary committees of futures contract markets and futures
associations.
   The new rule will go into effect 30 days after it is published
in the Federal Register.
   Spokesmen for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade said they now have stiffer rules governing their
members.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Andrew Yemma said the CFTC
``has already approved the rule change we proposed in mid-1989 that
bars anyone from serving on our board of governors or disciplinary
committees for a period of five years if they have a major
disciplinary history.''
   At the Board of Trade, Michael O'Connell said the board of
directors adopted a resolution in May ``reaffirming that it is and
has been the policy of the BOT that individual members with a
history of significant trade practice sanctions will not be
permitted to serve on the board of directors or exchange
disciplinary committees.''
   According to the CFTC rule, people subject to the three-year ban
include those who violate major rules of self-regulated
organizations, such as futures exchanges, or federal futures
regulations. People fined a total of more than $5,000 in a single
year for lesser violations also would be barred as well as those
convicted of certain felonies, including securities law violations,
embezzlement and fraud.
   The new rule also requires self-regulating organizations to
notify the CFTC whenever it takes a disciplinary action that would
disqualify an individual from serving on a committee or board.
   The organizations also will be required to submit an annual list
of people removed from committees under the rule.

<HEAD>Simmons to Seek Anti-Greenmail Proposal at Lockheed Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas billionaire Harold C. Simmons will ask
Lockheed Corp. shareholders to bar the company from paying
``greenmail'' to buy back its own stock, but the defense contractor
says he needn't bother.
   ``We have no intention of paying greenmail to anyone,'' Ron
Meder, a spokesman for California-based Lockheed, said Tuesday.
``We have not done so in the past and we don't intend to start
now.''
   Simmons, a Dallas investor with an 18.9 percent stake in
Lockheed, has launched a proxy fight to unseat the company's board
of directors.
   He has said he wants to eliminate Lockheed's shareholders rights
plan, also known as a poison-pill defense, that would make it
prohibitively expensive for anyone to buy more than 20 percent of
the company's common stock.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission through
his company NL Industries Inc., Simmons said he plans to introduce
a proposal at the shareholders annual meeting March 29 to
``prohibit the expenditure of Lockheed's funds to repurchase its
own equity securities at a premium price in transactions in which
all holders of such equity securities are not allowed to
participate on equal terms.''
   Such a proposal, if passed, would prevent Lockheed management
from trying to buy him off by offering above-market prices for the
stock he holds.
   That practice is also known as ``greenmail,'' a play on the word
blackmail.
   Simmons has said in the past that he is not a greenmailer
because all stockholders _ not just him _ would benefit from his
increased stake.

   Pay-television outlets would grab more sports
programming from broadcast TV, some magazines would have to close
and thousands of media jobs would be lost if tobacco and alcohol
advertising were outlawed, a new report by an advertiser and media
group says.
   But critics said the report failed to reflect the chance that
other advertisers would fill the void left by the tobacco and
alcohol advertisers.
   The report was released Tuesday by a group of advertisers, media
companies and ad agencies called The Leadership Council on
Advertising Issues, whose stated goal is to ``preserve and enhance
the freedom to advertise.''
   ``Our study shows that reduced advertising exacts social and
economic penalties from the public,'' said Reginald Brack, the Time
Warner Inc. executive who is co-chairman of the group.
   An author of the report said he hoped the findings would
encourage discussion of social and economic costs whenever
proposals to limit or tax advertising of tobacco, beer, wine and
liquor are debated.
   Co-author William Lilley III, president of Policy Communications
Inc., said policymakers often weigh only the social benefits at
stake when discussing ad bans.
   But critics called the findings unrealistic.
   ``It's just more scare tactics primarily,'' said George Hacker,
director for alcohol programs at The Advocacy Institute, a
Washington, D.C.-based group that often has aligned itself with
anti-smoking efforts and campaigns to promote reduced use of
alcohol.
   ``It fails to take into account the fact that every day new
products with advertising needs come on the market ready to spend
tons of money to attract a consumer base. The estimates of lost
jobs and decimation of the industry are quite exaggerated,'' he
said.
   Hacker said the television industry recovered fairly quickly
from the loss of ad revenue resulting from the 1971 ban on TV
tobacco ads.
   But Lilley said media alternatives have grown since then, and a
ban on advertising legal products could markedly affect whether a
wide range of television programming would be available without
charge to viewers.
   The report said beer and wine advertising, for instance, account
for about 15 percent of the advertising on sports programs carried
on the broadcast networks, local TV stations and basic cable
networks such as ESPN.
   But if beer and wine advertising were banned, the report said,
the decline in ad revenue would force those outlets to cut spending
on sports programs.
   The report estimated pay cable TV outlets that charge premiums
over the basic rates or fees for each program would be the big
winners, boosting their sports programming by about 39 percent over
current projections and paying for it by charging higher fees.
   The lack of sports programs would reduce the audience for
broadcast TV, and the smaller audiences would mean less ad revenue
and fewer resources for broadcasters to bid with for other
programs, the report said.
   Coverage of some sports such as boat racing might be dropped
altogether, it said.
   The losers would be lower-income consumers who could not afford
pay-cable and those without access to cable TV who would be
deprived of the full range of programs and information currently
provided by broadcast TV, the report said.
   The report said a ban on beer and wine advertising would cost
the broadcast television industry 4,232 jobs, or 2.9 percent of its
work force, by 1993.
   A ban on tobacco advertising would put 165 magazines out of
business, trimming circulation by about 5 percent and eliminating
4,130 jobs, the report said.
   Such general interest magazines as TV Guide, McCall's, Redbook
and Sports Illustrated _ which the report said each get more than
10 percent of their ad revenue from tobacco ads _ would feel the
impact.
   Magazines with large circulation and low prices generally are
least able to respond to losses of ad revenue, the report said,
because cover price increases trigger sharp drops in circulation.
   The report said lower-income readers would be affected the most
because they would be the most sensitive to higher magazine prices.
   A tobacco advertising ban also would cost 7,904 jobs in the
newspaper business, or 1.5 percent of the work force, the report
said.
   The report said a ban on hard liquor advertising would force 84
magazines out of business and cut magazine employment by 2,100.
   Most severely affected would be men's magazines such as Esquire
and Playboy, which get about 10 percent of their ad revenue from
liquor ads, and minority-oriented magazines such as Ebony and Black
Enterprise, which get 6.5 percent of their ad revenue from liquor
ads, the study said.

   Three Nordstrom Inc. stockholders have sued the
upscale clothing retailer claiming they suffered financial losses
because the company failed to disclose its labor problems.
   The suit filed in U.S. District Court Tuesday contended that
management knew, or should have known, that claims filed recently
by employees for unpaid work and overtime would adversely affect
the price of Nordstrom stock.
   Nordstrom stock continued to slump Tuesday, closing at $28 in
over-the-counter trading, down from a Sept. 1 high of $41.75.
   The suit asks that it be made a class action to include all
76,000 Nordstrom stockholders. It was filed by Elie de Comminges,
Alphonse Kaufman and Jessica Longston and did not ask for specific
damages.
   Named as defendants were Nordstrom co-chairmen Bruce Nordstrom,
James Nordstrom and John Nordstrom; John McMillan, president; and
John Goesling, chief financial officer.
   A Nordstrom spokeswoman said the company had not seen the suit
late Tuesday and would not comment.
   The company on Monday reported a fourth-quarter drop in earnings
of 34 percent, due in part to a $15 million charge to pay workers
back wages.
   The Washington state Department of Labor and Industries ruled
recently that Nordstrom was liable for back pay due workers who
were required to work ``off the clock,'' or on their own time.
Workers have said they stocked shelves, wrote thank you notes to
customers and attended company meetings on their own time.
   Nordstrom's 60 stores in the six states employ 30,000 people,
including 5,000 in Washington.

   The Exxon Corp. faces criminal charges and
$700 million or more in possible penalties from last year's tanker
spill that left hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline polluted with
oil.
   A federal grand jury in Alaska brought a five-count indictment
against the giant oil company and its shipping subsidiary on
Tuesday, charging it violated a number of federal laws in
connection with the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   ``The indictment ... represents our best shot at prosecuting
this incident,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in
announcing the indictment.
   The massive spill occurred when the huge tanker veered off
course in Prince William Sound and struck a reef on March 24, 1989,
spilling 11 million gallons of crude. It was the worst oil
catastrophe in U.S. history and caused widespread damage to
wildlife and Alaska's ecology.
   In New York, Exxon chairman Lawrence G. Rawl in a statement
called the grounding ``a tragic accident'' for which Exxon and its
shipping subsidiary ``have apologized to the American people,
especially the people of Alaska.''
   ``Nobody willfully grounded the ship or caused the spill,'' said
Rawl.
   Exxon stock tumbled $2 to $46.37{ a share in early trading today
on the New York Stock Exchange. The indictment was announced long
after the market closed on Tuesday.
   Exxon has spent more than $2 billion in cleanup efforts, but
environmentalists argue that the job is far from completed and the
total damages to natural resources may not be known for years.
   The indictment included two felony and three misdemeanor charges
that could lead to a total $1.6 million in criminal fines. In
addition, the government said it would seek at least $700 million _
perhaps substantially more _ in penalties under a separate law that
allows recovery of twice the amount of proven losses.
   Thornburgh said the eventual penalties against Exxon could be
substantially higher, depending on the amount of losses determined
at the time of a court verdict.
   Rawl's statement said: ``We will defend ourselves in court
against these charges. We believe there is no statutory basis for
the amount of the fines mentioned by the U.S. attorney general.''
   Thornburgh told a news conference the indictment was presented
to the grand jury after a proposed plea deal fell through. He said
the plea talks fell apart because of the unwillingness of Exxon to
meet the government's terms; in addition, state officials objected
to part of the proposed agreement.
   The indictment charged that Exxon employees aboard the tanker
acted inappropriately and that the corporation ``willfully and
knowingly'' allowed individuals who either lacked the required
license or were ``known to be physically or mentally incapable'' to
operate the vessel.
   The charges stemmed from reports that Exxon officials were aware
that Valdez captain Joseph Hazelwood had a history of drunken
driving convictions in New York state, but was allowed to remain in
command of the huge tanker.
   Hazelwood is on trial in a state court in Alaska on charges
including reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. He has denied being drunk at the time of
the accident.
   The plea bargain discussions resulted in sharp exchanges between
Alaska state officials and the Justice Department in recent weeks.
   In a letter to Justice last weekend, Alaska Attorney General
Doug Baily accused the department of trying to force the state into
signing off on an agreement by threatening to withhold continued
federal involvement in joint federal-state efforts to assess
damages from the spill.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said Tuesday night that Alaska played
no role in bringing about the federal charges.
   ``The bottom line for the people of Alaska is that our
fisheries, our shorelines and our other natural resources harmed by
this oil spill are returned as much as possible to their original
state. We want to recover whatever is necessary to restore Alaska
to what it was before the spill.''
   The charges against Exxon under the indictment were:
   _Violation of the Port and Waterways Safety Act, a felony.
   _Violation of the Dangerous Cargo Act, also a felony.
   _Violation of the Clean Water Act by illegally discharging
pollutants into Prince William Sound, a misdemeanor.
   _Unlawfully discharging refuse, the oil, also a misdemeanor.
   _Violating the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, stemming from the
deaths of more than 36,000 birds as a result of oil pollution, also
a misdemeanor.
   Each of the felony charges carries a maximum fine of $500,000,
while each misdemeanor counts carries a maximum penalty of
$200,000, the Justice officials said.
   Thornburgh said the indictment would not affect the civil
lawsuits brought by the state of Alaska and various environmental
and other groups against Exxon. He also said the federal government
could take separate civil action against the oil company.

   ``This does not come as a surprise,'' said Andrew Nibley, editor
of Reuters' North and Latin American operations. ``The judge has
merely decided to preserve the status quo until he has had a chance
to hear the merits of the case at a hearing.''
   ``We did seek such court action and we're encouraged to have
gotten it,'' Milt Capps, UPI's senior vice president for corporate
affairs, said of the restraining order issued by U.S. District
Judge Peter K. Leisure.
   Leisure issued the restraining order effective until a hearing
March 12 on UPI's request for a preliminary injunction.
   The two news services entered into an agreement in 1984 that UPI
would provide news pictures from the United States to Reuters,
while Reuters would provide UPI with pictures from other countries.
The agreement was to run for 10 years.
   On Feb. 16, the day the lawsuit was filed, Reuters said it was
canceling the agreement and interrupted the exchange for four hours.
   UPI's counterclaim was brought Monday. The news service denied
Reuters' allegations that UPI's service had declined since the
exchange started in 1985.
   Reuters has said it would establish its own network of
photographers in the United States while UPI has been exploring
other avenues for pictures from abroad.

   The stock market eked out modest gains in early
trading today as blue chips managed to extend this week's winning
streak.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 52.93 points
over the past two sessions, was up another 5.85 at 2,622.97 by 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outpaced losers among New York Stock Exchange listed
issues by 11 to 8, with 527 up, 383 down and 496 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.36 to 182.52.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 21.88 million
shares after the first 30 minutes of trading.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index edged
0.19 higher to 351.59.
   Market watchers said stocks could run into resistence today due
to worries about how corporate profits will fare in the face of a
prolonged period of sluggish economic growth.
   The government's latest reading on the economy came out this
morning before the market opened and it showed the gross national
product grew at a 0.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of
1989, faster than previously estimated but still the slowest pace
in more than three years.
   The Commerce Department said its revised estimate of
October-December growth means the GNP _ the nation's total output
of goods and services _ rose 3 percent for all of 1989. That was
the slowest yearly advance since a 2.7 percent gain in 1986 and
followed a 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   A continuing recovery in Tokyo from Monday's steep plunge
soothed lingering anxieties on Wall Street over a possible repeat
of October 1987's worldwide slump in stocks, analysts said.
   Actively trading blue chips in the early going included:
International Business Machines, down &lsqb; to 103| and McDonalds, up &lsqb;
at 31}.
   Exxon, which faces criminal charges and $700 million or more in
possible penalties from last year's tanker spill, was off } to 47|.
A federal grand jury in Alaska brought a five-count indictment
against the giant oil company and its shipping subsidiary on late
Tuesday.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
jumped 38.29 points on Monday, added another 14.64 to close at
2,617.12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 927 up, 558 down and
496 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 152.59 million
shares, up slightly from 148.91 million in the previous session.
   The NYSE's composite index ended 0.90 higher at 182.16.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at
351.40, up 1.04.

   A former brokerage house chairman has been
sentenced to five years in prison for a stock manipulation
conspiracy discovered after the October 1987 market crash that cost
clients more than $5 million.
   ``A fraudulent scheme was carried out and resulted in great
losses to people and firms in the investment community,'' U.S.
District Judge Thomas P. Griesa said at Tuesday's sentencing of
Eugene Laff.
   Laff, 52, of Greenwich, Conn., is the former chairman of Haas
Securities Corp., which collapsed nine days after the crash. He was
convicted in December of five counts of conspiracy, securities
fraud, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   The prosecution maintained that the firm schemed to artificially
raise the prices of so-called ``penny stocks,'' inexpensive
securities traded over the counter, by creating false demand for
the shares, a scheme that couldn't be maintained after the market
dropped.
   Laff asked the judge for probation so he could earn money to pay
back the victims of the fraud, many of whom have filed civil
lawsuits seeking restitution.
   ``There is no question that crimes were committed when I was
chairman at Haas,'' Laff said. ``If only I had the power to turn
back the clock and undo the past, but I cannot.''
   Griesa, however, said that he would not depart from federal
sentencing guidelines, which mandated a prison term. The judge said
he took into consideration the loss to Haas Securities clients of
more than $5 million and his finding that Laff falsely testified
there was no scheme to manipulate stock prices.
   Griesa allowed Laff to remain free pending appeal.

<HEAD>Merchandise Trade Deficit More Than Doubles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit more than
doubled in January to an unexpected 1.98 billion pounds, or about
$3.3 billion at current exchange rates, the government said
Wednesday.
   The government blamed a drop in Britain's oil surplus and an
unusually high level of imports of such items as diamonds for the
widening gap between imports and exports.
   The seasonally adjusted deficit compared with a deficit of 917
million pounds in December, the Central Statistical Office said.
   It said the current account deficit soared to 1.88 billion
pounds from 817 million pounds. The January current account deficit
was the highest since September 1989, when it totaled 1.9 billion
pounds.
   Excluding the unusual items would reduce the January current
account figure by about 500 million pounds, the office said.
   The current account deficit equals the merchandise trade deficit
plus ``invisibles'' trade.
   Invisibles cover services, overseas investment earnings and
official transfer payments, and was estimated to be in surplus by
100 million pound.
   The January figures compare with market expectations of a
merchandise trade deficit of 1.22 billion pounds and a current
account deficit of 1.3 billion pounds.
   Exports totaled 8.6 billion pounds in January, down from 8.7
billion pounds in December. Imports totaled 10.6 billion pounds in
January, up from 9.6 billion pounds in December.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that Japan
will ``do more'' to ease trade friction with the United States and
pledged further efforts to reform Japanese politics.
   Kaifu presented his new Cabinet to Emperor Akihito after a long
wrangle in his conservative party over his insistence on keeping
scandal-tainted politicians out of the administration.
   As he was doing so, a weekly magazine said it would publish an
article Thursday charging that Kaifu received larger donations than
he has acknowledged from a company at the heart of a 1988
influence-peddling scandal.
   Kaifu's difficulty in forming a Cabinet came shortly before he
was to leave for California, where President Bush is expected to
urge Japan to be more conciliatory in sluggish trade talks.
   ``There is no magic word that will erase the $49 billion trade
surplus,'' Kaifu told a nationally televised news conference.
   Japan will reform import taxes and expand domestic demand, he
said, but ``that is not enough, so we will do more. If you look
closely at what we're doing in Japan-U.S. relations, you'll see how
hard we are working.''
   Kaifu revealed no details of new initiatives Japan might offer
in his talks Friday and Saturday with Bush in Palm Springs.
   Officials in both countries spoke of the need to develop their
``global partnership'' despite deep problems between the two
biggest economies in the capitalist world.
   But a question mark hangs over the government's political
strength to take domestic and international initiatives, even
though the scandal-plagued governing party won a strong majority in
the Feb. 18 parliamentary election.
   ``I think you should see it as a kind of purification,'' Kaifu
said of the election victory. ``In any case, the party has been
reborn with the people's trust, and our mission is to carry out
political reform.''
   Formation of the 21-member Cabinet was announced early today as
the prime minister prevailed in his insistence on a ``clean''
government _ a requirement that eliminates the top echelon of his
Liberal Democratic Party.
   Kaifu did not speak directly about problems forming the Cabinet,
saying he had wanted the best government possible to deal with
pressing foreign issues as well as domestic problems such as taxes,
welfare and the aging society.
   He indicated, however, that he also would insist on keeping
scandal-tainted politicians out of sub-Cabinet level offices such
as vice minister posts.
   In its March 8 issue, which goes on sale Thursday, Shukan
Bunshun magazine said Kaifu received a total of 26.3 million yen
($177,100) in donations from Recruit Co. between 1983 and 1987.
When he took office in August, Kaifu said he received only 14.4
million yen ($96,970), all in legal donations.
   In a news conference today, Kaifu denied he received more. ``I
have checked thoroughly and reported everything,'' he said. ``It is
hard to prove the fact that I did not receive (additional
donations) when I did not receive them.''
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, a holdover from the Cabinet
Kaifu formed last summer after two prime ministers resigned in
quick succession amid money and sex scandals, indicated he would
accompany Kaifu to the summit with Bush.
   Trade will be the key issue in the U.S. talks, he said, and he
also expected to discuss ``global issues, such as the environment,
population and drugs, as well as technology transfers.''
   Bush sent his invitation to Kaifu last weekend after U.S. and
Japanese negotiators expressed frustration at lack of progress in
trade talks. U.S. officials said they had hoped for more political
direction from the Japanese side, since the Japanese elections were
over.
   Kaifu, 59, comes from a small faction in the Liberal Democratic
Party but exerted political muscle against more powerful faction
leaders in keeping out scandal-tainted figures.
   The struggle showed, however, that the prime minister may have
difficulty keeping support of the contenders for power.
   Referring indirectly to the factional struggles, Kaifu said
Japan has to clean up money politics and move toward more
policy-oriented elections.
   ``This harks back to the faction question _ little by little, we
should get rid of them,'' he said.
   The liberal-leaning newspaper Asahi Shimbun denounced as a
``disgrace'' the attempt by former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe
to nominate Koko Sato to the Cabinet. Sato was convicted on a
criminal charge in a 1970s Lockheed scandal.
   Kaifu also rebuffed an attempt by former Foreign Minister
Shintaro Abe to name a politician tainted by the Recruit scandal,
in which many profited from sales of pre-listed shares in a Recruit
subsidiary in return for political favors.

<TEXT>
   Senate and White House negotiators are
pressing towards agreement by Thursday's deadline on key parts of a
compromise clean air package including curbs on automobile
emissions and acid rain pollution.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who had
vowed earlier in the week to bring the legislation up for floor
action no later than Thursday, backed away from that goal slightly
after a second straight day of marathon talks that lasted past
midnight.
   ``It's obviously getting more difficult, but we're still
hoping,'' Mitchell said of the deadline he imposed for floor action.
   Mitchell said this morning that he expected to conclude the
private discussions with the administration by the end of the day,
but he could not say if an agreement would emerge.
   Senate leaders and the Bush administration representatives have
been working for three weeks to craft a compromise bill that will
gain White House backing and blunt regional opposition from some
lawmakers.
   The discussions Tuesday centered on the automobile emission
control section of the bill, which is aimed at dramatically
reducing urban smog by the end of the decade.
   The White House earlier in the week abandoned its staunch
opposition to a second round of auto tailpipe emission controls,
but details of how such controls might go into effect have thwarted
agreement among the negotiators, participants said.
   ``In all negotiations that last inch is darkness. And we are in
the last inch, literally,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the
clean air bill's floor leader.
   Key differences also remained on acid rain controls, but that
largely involves disagreement over whether to accommodate a group
of Midwest senators who want help in paying for costly emission
controls at the dirtiest coal-fired electric plants.
   The Bush administration and Senate leaders who support the
Senate clean air legislation have opposed cost-sharing assistance
to the Midwest.
   Sources close to the discussions said the remaining differences
on acid rain, including the cost-sharing question, were not large
enough to threaten compromise on an overall agreement.
   The closed-door iscussions are aimed at fashioning a legislative
package that will have the support of the Bush administration and
enough senators to avoid a lengthy floor fight and potential
filibuster.
   Lobbyists from the auto industry and those representing various
environmental groups were staked out near the meeting room Tuesday
night, awaiting word of an agreement.
   Some environmentalists have sharply criticized the closed-door
talks, maintaining that the tactic was significantly weakening a
strong Senate ill approved by the Environment and Public Works
Committee last November.
   ``It's disintegrating before our eyes,'' said Richard Ayres,
executive director of the Clean Air Coalition and a member of the
Natural Resources Defense Council.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower,
then turned mostly higher in early trading today on the Chicago
Board of Trade, reflecting strength in the soybean oil market.
   The early gains in soybean oil extend a pattern of higher oil
prices and lower soybean meal prices stemming from generally slack
demand for soybean meal in Europe.
   The contract for March delivery of soybean oil was up .47 cent
at 21.13 cents a pound in early trading.
   Tuesday's National Weather Service 90-day outlook was considered
generally negative for the grain markets, with a forecast for
above-normal precipitation from March through May in the
mid-Mississippi River Valley and the western Great Lakes region.
   The Agriculture Department announced approval today of China's
bid for 160,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, a
positive development for wheat prices.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to { cent
higher with March at $3.94 a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to
} cent higher with March at $2.45\ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to
2\ cents higher with March at $1.37 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent
to 3 cents higher with March at $5.62{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were lower.
   Live cattle futures were .02 cent lower to .08 cent higher with
April at 75.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to .15
cent higher with March at 80.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .02
cent to .17 cent lower with April at 49.80 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .20 cent to .57 cent lower with March at 50.70
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher Tuesday while pork futures
declined, led by losses of up to 2 cents, the permitted daily
limit, in the pork belly market.

<TEXT>
   USX Corp. plans to ask the U.S. Supreme
Court to review an appeals court's ruling that the company
discriminated against 8,000 black job applicants at a steel mill, a
spokesman said today.
   The appeals court last week upheld a 1983 U.S. District Court
decision for the second time. The Supreme Court last year ordered
the appeals court to restudy the case under more stringent
standards for proving bias that the high court imposed on June 5.
   USX spokesman Ernie Glenn said the company would seek a review
of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on the ground that
the appeals court misapplied the Supreme Court's new interpretation
of civil rights law.
   The June 5 decision said minorities could not rely solely on
statistics to prove discrimination but must link the data to a
specific corporate employment policy.
   The decision also let companies justify practices that
statistically appear discriminatory by showing they followed a
reasonable employment policy.
   The appeals court ruled Friday that even under the more
restrictive guidelines, the black job applicants in the
class-action lawsuit had proved discrimination.
   The court found that because the positions at the Fairless
Hills, Pa., steel mill were for unskilled workers, ``any
able-bodied person should be competent to perform the job.''
   But the company's job interviews had a ``significantly disparate
impact on blacks, as the percentage of successful black
interviewees was significantly less than the overall percentage of
successful interviewees,'' Chief Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr.
wrote in the appeals court decision. Other judges taking part in
the decision were Carol Los Mansmann and Max Rosenn.
   Attorney Richard Z. Freemann Jr., who represented the job
applicants, estimated the ruling could cost the steel manufacturer
nearly $30 million.
   ``I'm not surprised to learn that,'' Freemann said of the USX
decision to seek review. ``I'm disappointed that the distribution
of funds will have to wait awhile. But I'm confident that we'll
prevail.''

   You can't pay much attention to the financial
news these days without seeing vivid images of the dangers of
taking risks.
   Many ``junk'' bonds, apparently, are turning out to be true to
their name. The bank and savings and loan industries are littered
with the casualties of ill-considered ventures.
   Supposedly sacrosanct real estate markets in places like the
Northeast have turned poisonous. Even the sky-high Japanese stock
market seems not to be immune.
   Those who have suffered from these reversals aren't attracting
much sympathy. The feeling among their fellows seems to be,
``that's what comes of taking chances.''
   Perhaps so. But in the current climate of upheaval, some
students of the subject say, the idea of risk-taking itself may be
getting a bad rap.
   They argue that just about all business ventures, like many
other things in life, are based on running risks.
   In this view, risk is pretty much a constant, part of the
natural order, and even when it cannot be prevented or reduced it
can be managed to minimize its harmful effects.
   When mischief occurs, it most often happens because people
underestimated or just plain ignored the risks they were taking.
   As John T. Reed, a specialist in real estate investing, put it:
``Gamblers take risks for the thrill of it. Investors take
CALCULATED risks because their calculations show they will be
better off financially if they do.''
   The difference, Reed says in his newsletter Real Estate
Investor's Monthly, can be illustrated through the simple device of
a flip of a coin.
   A gambler probablya would take an even-money bet that a given
coin flip would turn up heads. Devotees of lotteries and other
long-shot propositions might even stake small amounts on the chance
that the coin would land on its edge.
   But wise investors would look for some edge in their favor
before they put their money up. On a 50-50 proposition like a coin
flip, for example, they might demand a payoff of $11 for each $10
chance they took.
   In addition to knowing their statistical chances of success,
investors like to know as precisely as possible the expected value
of winning and the penalty paid for losing.
   On top of that, they inquire into the worst possible outcomes
that could befall them, in order to gauge their exposure even to
freakish damage.
   For people who don't patronize casinos, what use is all this?
Well, it turns out there is much more to risk-management in the
world than eschewing gambling.
   Customers of insurance companies, for example, merely buy the
right to transfer a risk they face to an institution that is
willing to assume it for a price that is usually profitable.
   Likewise, investing of all kinds involves at least an estimate
of risk. The ``aggressive'' individual may opt for some vehicle
with a speculative reputation; the ``conservative'' investor sticks
with supposed safety.
   But when the information used to make the calculation is suspect
or not fully understood, Reed observes, ``to discuss the issue in
terms of optimism vs. conservatism is to descend to mere
name-calling.
   ``The question is not who is optimistic or who is conservative.
The question is, who is right?
   ``Either you have the data to calculate your risks or you don't.
Inadequate data combined with optimism is still inadequate data.
Indeed, that combination is more dangerous than inadequate data
alone.''

   Prices were little changed on London's Stock
Exchange Wednesday as disappointing British trade figures curbed an
advance on a stronger showing by Wall Street.
   Dealers said investors were wary of any gains in equity markets,
and would likely remain so.
   ``At these levels, the market feels tired and looks out of
steam,'' said one director of equities at a U.S. brokerage firm in
London. ``The underlying tone doesn't feel all that good and the
least little setback on Wall Street would put us back ...''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 0.6
point, or 0.03 percent, at 2,255.4.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was 0.1 point higher at
1,781.4 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.69
point to close at 1,225.01.
   Volume came to a light 363 million shares, compared with 364.7
million shares Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 24.32 points at 2,641.44
when the London market closed. But market watchers said there was
little London confidence behind the advance in New York,
particularly in light of the broad gyrations in Tokyo this week.
   Market watchers said the London market was displeased with
Wednesday's British trade report.
   The government reported that Britain's merchandise trade deficit
more than doubl5dto a worse-than-expected 1.98 billion pounds, or
$3.3 billion, in January.
   It blamed a drop in Britain's oil surplus and an unusually high
level of erratic items.

<HEAD>Market Upheavals May End Cheap Capital, But Growth Seen Continuing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent upheavals in Japan's capital markets may put
a financial squeeze on Japanese industry and slow economic growth,
analysts say, but few believe a recession will result.
   ``Economic conditions are still strong,'' said Hiroshi Kadota of
the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations' Financial Affairs
Bureau. ``Investment is expanding. The capital markets are
returning to a normal trend.''
   Japanese industry for years has been able to raise capital for
growth at relatively little cost, but its fabled markets have shown
signs of sputtering lately.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange, where Sony Corp., for example, raised
$2.7 billion earlier this month to help finance its overseas
investments, has gyrated wildly this year. After reaching record
highs at the close of 1989, the exchange's key index declined by
some 14 percent before rebounding Tuesday and Wednesday.
   Interest rates have been rising since last summer, when the Bank
of Japan began battling inflation by raising its discount rate _
the interest it charges for loans to commercial banks _ to 4.25
percent from 2.5 percent. Anticipation of a further increase has
send bond prices plummeting in tandem with stock prices, increasing
corporate borrowing costs.
   Many analysts regard these developments as corrections in an
overheated capital market, rather than a vote of no confidence in
the underlying economy.
   Adrian Tschoegl, an economist with SBCI Securities Asia, said,
``The fall in the Tokyo market is a bit like the New York crash of
'87. Everyone cried `recession' then, but nothing much happened.
The Tokyo market is coming down from an overheated level. The
effect is going to be very slight.''
   Nevertheless, with interest rates up and the stock market down,
some Japanese companies apparently are shelving plans to raise
equity capital in the near future and are turning to their own
reserves to fuel growth.
   ``Several issues we're involved in have been pulled back,''
Tschoegl said.
   As much as $6.8 billion worth of convertible bonds, warrants and
shares were scheduled to come on to the market by the end of March,
several brokers said. Many of these issues will be deferred, they
said.
   ``Equity financing is one of the most important vehicles to
raise funds for Japanese corporations. Obviously, they do not want
to go ahead now if they believe they're going to hurt their
long-term financing,'' said Yutaka Nakai, an analyst with Daiwa
Securities Co. ``They can be flexible about when to raise funds.''
   Large Japanese corporations are able to weather rough sailing in
the capital markets, said Kadota, ``because they have vast reserves
of liquidity.'' He said a poll of business leaders conducted this
month by his organization found confidence in continued growth was
high.
   Toshiaki Kakimoto, chief economist at Sumitomo Bank, predicted
Japan's gross national product growth would decline moderately to
4.5 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31 and to 4.3 percent
in fiscal 1990 from 5.3 percent in fiscal 1988.
   If the financial environment worsens, large companies may have
to liquidate some of their fixed assets, mainly real estate, says
Yoshiaki Takanashi, head of economic research at Yasuda Trust Bank.
   ``Real estate will suffer to some extent. Investment overseas
may be reviewed,'' he said.
   At that point, he said, ``if the market deteriorates further,
then a crisis could occur.''
   But under present conditions, he said, only small and
medium-size companies that rely on bank financing to survive face
any real hardship.

   About 27,000 gallons of heating oil poured
into a busy waterway near an Exxon Corp. terminal this morning as
it was being loaded onto a barge with a hole in it, the Coast Guard
said.
   The No. 6 heating oil leaked into the Kill Van Kull, a major
route for barge and tanker traffic that separates Bayonne from New
York's Staten Island, the Coast Guard said. The spill was
discovered at about 4:20 a.m. and had begun about an hour earlier,
authorities said.
   Exxon, indicted just this week on charges stemming from last
year's Alaska tanker spill, issued a statement saying the company
was helping out with the cleanup but was not responsible for
today's spill.
   Lt. Jeff Crawley, a Coast Guard spokesman, said the oil poured
through a 12-inch-by-6-inch hole, and forced the closing of the
busy waterway. Crawley said he didn't know what caused the hole in
the barge.
   ``The barge has numerous tanks, six or seven, and the oil is
pumped from the facility to the barge,'' said Crawley.
   The barge owner, Ekolof Marine of Staten Island, N.Y., initially
estimated the leak at 420 gallons, said Rick Fulton, a spokesman
for the Department of Environmental Protection. The Coast Guard
revised the figure, initially to 24,000 gallons and later to 27,000
gallons, after studying the site, he said.
   Two environmental cleanup companies hired by Ekolof were at the
scene this morning, laying containment booms, Fulton said. The
spill spans the 3{-mile length of the Kill Van Kull, and sheens
were spotted as far away as Liberty Island, about five miles
northeast of the spill site.
   Exxon issued a statement saying the Eklof barge was loading
heating oil at Exxon's Bayonne terminal, but the oil company was
not involved in the spill. Exxon said Eklof had purchased the oil
and was loading it for an international customer.
   ``Eklof has acknowledged responsibility for the spill and the
cleanup effort,'' said Exxon spokesman Jack Hollern. ``Exxon has
offered its full cooperation to the Coast Guard and the barge owner
in assistance with the spill response.'' A person answering the
phone at Eklof's offices said the company had no immediate comment.
   Fulton said it was too early to gauge how much damage wildlife
may have suffered, adding that the area where it occured is ``one
heck of a developed strip.''
   The spill is located within miles of the confluence of the Kull
and Arthur Kill, the scene of the Jan. 1-2 spill that leaked
567,000 gallons of heating oil from a pipe that connects Exxon Co.
USA's terminal here with the Bayway refinery.
   Exxon is under investigation by the state Department of
Environmental Protection and the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency for the January spill. DEP and EPA officials said they had
no comment immediately on today's spill.
   Exxon faces lawsuits from the DEP, Elizabeth and New York for
the January spill.
   Today's spill comes one day after a federal grand jury in Alaska
brought a five-count indictment against Exxon and its shipping
subsidiary on charges they violated federal laws in connection with
the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska last March.
   Exxon faces $700 million or more in possible penalties the spill
of nearly 11 million gallons of crude in Prince William Sound that
left hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline polluted with oil.

   The dollar ended European dealings Wednesday
modestly higher after a better-than-expected report on the U.S.
economy.
   The U.S. currency was also supported by new worries about the
implications of the expected German monetary union.
   Dealers said the dollar advanced after the U.S. government
reported the gross national product had risen at an annual rate of
0.9 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to a preliminary
estimate of 0.5 percent.
   The market had expected the revised GNP to be lower.
   Reports that West German officials were giving serious
consideration for a one-for-one swap of West German marks with East
Germany's marks also boosted the dollar, dealers said.
   ``More and more talk of one-for-one exchange has been
surfacing,'' said Martin Ely, chief interbank dealer at Midland
Bank in London. ``The dollar right now is looking like a safe
haven.''
   The dollar was quoted late in the day at 1.6955 West German
marks, up from 1.6836 marks late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4857; 5.7300
French francs, up from 5.7010; 1.9070 Dutch guilders, up from
1.8985; 1,250.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.25; and 1.2072
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1908.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.6895, compared
with $1.6915 late Tuesday.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, falling 0.51 yen to 148.52
yen. In London, the dollar was quoted higher at 148.75 yen.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.90 a troy
ounce, up from $407.25 bid late Tuesday.
   But in Zurich, the metal fell to a bid price of $407.79 from
$411.25 Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.07 to close at a bid $408.92.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.10 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.11.

   The name of The Kansas City Star will
live on when the storied, 110-year-old afternoon paper where young
Ernest Hemingway worked as a reporter merges Thursday with its
morning partner, The Kansas City Times.
   Many other things will go _ the Star's afternoon publishing
time, its layout and typeface. Some call it the end of an era.
   But Editor Joe McGuff sees just another stage in the newspaper's
colorful history, which began in 1880 in a rough but booming river
town and includes years when political boss Tom Pendergast ruled
the city's voting booths and the paper's president Roy Roberts
helped persuade Dwight Eisenhower he'd be a good president.
   The Star's course has included Pulitzers, corporate buyouts and
growing competition with TV. The Star and Times have won seven
Pulitzers, including a joint award for their investigation into the
1981 Hyatt Regency skywalk collapse that killed 114 people.
   Like hundreds of afternoon papers, the Star has faced declining
readership. Its circulation dropped by 100,000 in the '80s and
stood at 165,000 in September. The Times' circulation is 270,000;
the Star's Sunday readership is 416,000.
   ``It's inevitable, and that takes away some of the sting,'' said
George R. Burg, who started on the desk in 1948, moved up to
managing editor and now directs philanthropic activities as
assistant to the publisher. ``People just don't read afternoon
papers anymore.''
   William Rockhill Nelson and Samuel E. Morss started the Kansas
City Evening Star on Sept. 18, 1880, a debut with a circulation of
3,000. The four-page paper cost 2 cents. Nelson bought out his
partner the next year.
   By 1892, circulation was 50,000. In 1901, Nelson purchased the
33-year-old Times, which even at the turn of the century was still
a diehard sympathizer of the Confederate cause. The words ``The
Morning Kansas City Star'' appeared as a subhead on its masthead
until 1977.
   Hemingway joined the Star in 1917, covering the train station, a
hospital and police precinct before leaving seven months later to
join an ambulance unit in Italy.
   When Nelson died in 1915, his will stipulated the paper should
go to his wife and daughter and then be sold after their deaths.
Employees led by Nelson's son-in-law, Irwin Kirkwood, submitted the
winning bid in 1926 and established the employee ownership that
would stand for five decades.
   The newspaper earned a reputation as a crusader when it turned
against Pendergast in the mid-1930s, and the political boss fell
from power all the way to a prison cell for tax evasion.
   In the mid-20th century, the newspaper's president was Roberts,
who sat at his desk in the newsroom talking to the Republican rich
and powerful on the phone. He persuaded one friend, Eisenhower, to
run for president.
   In 1977, Capital Cities Communications, based in New York,
bought the paper for $125 million, making millionaires of a few
stockholders.
   ``They made a lot of changes that resulted in firings and forced
retirements,'' said Joe Henderson, the paper's longtime federal
court reporter, who is retiring. ``It was a bitter time. But those
who survived are certainly a lot better off, in salary and fringe
benefits, I think, than under the old Star.''
   The merger won't result in any layoffs for the 300 newsroom
employees.
   The Times remained in the Star's shadow for years. Times
reporters, for example, identified themselves as Star reporters
when doing interviews.
   ``Otherwise, no one would have known who they were,'' said Burg.
   But as the Star's circulation dropped over the years, the Times
got more important. Its circulation bypassed the Star's in 1965.
   After the 1977 sale, editors placed the two news staffs in
direct competition for the first time in an effort to improve
reporting. Advertising and production staffs worked for both papers.
   Despite the attempt at direct competition, the Star in the last
decade became known for its features, while the Times concentrated
on national, international and regional news.
   Now employees and readers await Thursday morning's newspapers _
and morning newspapers thereafter.
   ``One lady told me she'll have to read half the paper in the
morning,'' Burg said, ``and save the other half for afternoon.''

   Hundreds of thousands of dollars in bank
loans to Rep. Harold Ford were nothing more than ``a shell game''
to hide political payoffs, a prosecutor said today at the opening
of Ford's bank fraud trial.
   But Ford's attorney said the loans from Butcher brother banks
were legitimate loans that Ford fully intended to repay, and he has
repaid.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Humble said the bogus loans,
eventually totaling some $1.5 million, were to pay Ford for
political and personal influence on behalf of former Tennessee
bankers Jake Butcher and C.H. Butcher Jr.
   ``The Butchers wanted him to use that power for their own
interests ... so they lent him money,'' Humble said in his opening
argument. ``There was no way Harold Ford could repay this money. He
knew it. The Butchers knew it.
   ``The only thing he could give was his political influence and
he did.''
   He said that what appeared to be loans were actually payoffs.
``It was not intended that Harold Ford pay this money back,''
Humble said,
   Humble said Ford began receiving money from the Butcher brothers
in 1972 when he was a state representative with little money or
personal property.
   As Ford's political power grew, the Butcher payoffs also
increased in size and in the 1980s he received one loan for
$350,000, the prosecutor said.
   Defense attorney William McDaniels responded to the government's
charges by proclaiming his client's innocence, calling the case
``an attack on Harold Ford personally. It is an attack on his
political life.''
   ``They were not phony loans,'' McDaniels said. ``They were
intended to be repaid.''
   The $350,000 loan, at issue in 11 of the 19 criminal counts
against Ford, was issued by C.H. Butcher's now-defunct Southern
Industrial Banking Corp. to a company called Tenn-Ford Inc.
   The government contends Tenn-Ford was a sham company, but Ford
says the loan went through Tenn-Ford to the family funeral home,
N.J. Ford &amp; Son's Funeral Parlor. In his opening statement,
McDaniels said Ford was not responsible for the loan.
   After SIBC went bust in 1983, Ford acted as majority stockholder
in the funeral home while dealing with a bankruptcy trustee to
settle the SIBC loan for $25,000.
   Ford is charged with conspiracy, bank fraud and mail fraud.
   He is on trial with three co-defendants, former Butcher
accountant David Crabtree and lawyers Douglas Beaty and Karl
Schledwitz.
   The four were indicted in Knoxville in April 1987, and the trial
was moved to Memphis at Ford's request.
   Ford, the only black member of Tennessee's congressional
delegation, contends he was indicted in Knoxville because East
Tennessee is heavily Republican and primarily white.
   Ford's congressional district, which includes most of Memphis,
is two-thirds black. He was first elected to Congress in 1974.
   The jury has eight black members and four whites. One of the
jury's two alternates is white, the other black.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by strength
in the soy complex that was centered in the surging soybean oil
market.
   Analysts said the rally appeared to be inspired more by chart
signals than supply-and-demand factors, although some buying was
linked to Taiwan's overnight purchase of 23,000 metric tons of
soybeans, talk of Iraqi interest in U.S. soybean meal and
perceptions that soybean-crushing activity is slowing.
   Soybean oil for delivery in March soared to a seven-month high
of $21.15 per hundredweight during the session and closed with a
gain of 34 cents at $21 per hundredweight.

   The stock market was broadly higher in afternoon
trading today but blue chips struggled to maintain this week's
winning streak.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 52.93 points
over the past two sessions, was up 6.75 at 2,623.87 as of 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   The widely-watched market gauge had sported gains of better than
20 points earlier but blue-chip issues succumbed to profit-taking.
   Gainers outpaced losers among New York Stock Exchange listed
issues by about 3 to 2, with 860 up, 555 down and 521 unchanged.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks moved
0.52 higher to 182.68.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 151.33 million
shares with one hour left to go in the session.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 1.05
to 352.45.
   Market watchers said stocks continued to benefit from improved
investor confidence reflecting Wall Street's ability to withstand a
recent slump in Tokyo without any apparent ill effects.
   A continuing recovery earlier today in Tokyo from Monday's steep
plunge reinforced the positive tone while an upward revision in the
government's estimate of economic growth also helped.
   The government's latest reading on the economy came out this
morning before the market opened and it showed the gross national
product grew at a 0.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of
1989, faster than previously estimated but still the slowest pace
in more than three years.
   The Commerce Department said its revised estimate of
October-December growth means the GNP _ the nation's total output
of goods and services _ rose 3 percent for all of 1989. That was
the slowest yearly advance since a 2.7 percent gain in 1986 and
followed a 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   Actively trading blue chips included: American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, unchanged at 39|, International Business Machines, down
&rsqb; at 103&rsqb;, General Motors, unchanged at 45 and General Electric, up
\ at 61}.
   Exxon, which faces criminal charges and $700 million or more in
possible penalties from last year's tanker spill, slumped 1&rsqb; to 47
in heavy volume. A federal grand jury in Alaska brought a
five-count indictment against the giant oil company and its
shipping subsidiary late Tuesday.

Foods Corp. in 1988, defaulted on a $133 million loan and is
negotiating with its lenders for additional working capital,
spokesmen said Wednesday.
   Company Chairman Larry Doskocil said the current financial
situation results from many factors, including delays in the sale
of a Wilson division and a high level of interest expense.
   ``Operating profits have been lower than expected in recent
quarters,'' Doskocil said, but added, ``Despite the current
difficulties, the company believes its operations are fundamentally
sound.''
   Doskocil, a leading supplier of pre-cooked pizza toppings and
other specialty meats, acquired the much larger Wilson Foods, an
Oklahoma based meatpacker, in a deal valued at about $133 million.
   Part of the default involves $1.7 million in loan payments
required because of reductions in Doskocil inventory and accounts
receivable that helped secure the debt, the company said.
   Also unpaid is a $165,000 payment due Feb. 15 on another loan
backed by company stock.
   Spokesmen said Doskocil is negotiating with its raw material
suppliers the terms under which purchases can be made.
   The company is exploring options including debt restructuring,
the spokesmen said.

   Bank of New England Corp., which was expected to
name a new chairman Wednesday, delayed an announcement but said it
should be made by the end of the week.
   Sources close to the bank have said the new chairman would be
Lawrence K. Fish, a former Bank of Boston Corp. executive.
   Fish's appointment was expected to be announced Wednesday, but
Tom Lavelle, a Bank of New England spokesman, said ``an
announcement should be made by the end of the week.''
   Lavelle said there were no problems and added that previous news
reports were premature.
   The naming of a new chairman has been widely anticipated since
the bank dismissed several top executives this year, including
former chairman Walter Connolly.
   Bank of New England shook up its senior level management after
reporting its 1989 losses would surpass $1 billion, largely due to
problem real estate loans.
   The bank also was expected to announce details of a consent
order from the federal government that would outline steps to
restore the company to financial health.

<HEAD>Comptroller Denies Attempt To Halt New England Real Estate Lending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief regulator of national banks denied
Wednesday that his agency is trying to bring real estate lending to
a halt in New England.
   ``That's simply not true,'' Comptroller of the Currency Robert
L. Clarke told the National Council of Savings Institutions.
   ``We have sounded warnings. But the warnings are warnings to
take care, not to abandon the business entirely,'' he said.
   Clarke's office, which supervises 4,600 nationally chartered
banks, has urged banks to exercise more caution in real estate
lending, provoking complaints from some in New England who have
accused regulators of discouraging loans to reliable borrowers.
   However, Clarke said not every real estate loan in New England
is a bad bet.
   ``If the specific ... loan is justified, do it,'' he said.
   ``There is nothing inherently wrong with real estate or
construction lending. There is nothing inherently wrong with
dynamite, either. The problem comes in how you handle them. ... If
you handle them negligently or with reckless disregard, they can,
and will, blow you away,'' he said.
   Many of the real estate loan problems in New England and
elsewhere ``are the result of poor management practices: specific
people acting at specific institutions,'' he said.

   The stock market moved broadly higher today and
blue chips managed to extend this week's winning streak.
   Market watchers said stocks continued to benefit from improved
investor confidence stemming from Wall Street's ability to
withstand a recent slump in Tokyo without suffering any apparent
ill effects.
   A continuing recovery in Tokyo from Monday's steep plunge
reinforced the positive tone while an upward revision in the
government's estimate of economic activity also helped.
   The government's latest reading on the economy came out this
morning before the market opened and it showed the gross national
product grew at a 0.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of
1989, faster than previously estimated but still the slowest pace
in more than three years.
   The Commerce Department said its revised estimate of
October-December growth means the GNP _ the nation's total output
of goods and services _ rose 3 percent for all of 1989. That was
the slowest yearly advance since a 2.7 percent gain in 1986 and
followed a 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   Analysts said the stock market's upward momentum could bump into
into resistence due to worries about how corporate profits will
fare in the face of a prolonged period of sluggish economic growth.

<HEAD>A Year Later, Eastern is Taking On a New Character</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, the Eastern Airlines terminal at
sprawling Atlanta airport resembled a ghost town, shut down by
angry pickets in what has become one of the longest strikes in
commercial aviation history.
   Today the strikers have dwindled to bitter holdouts of the
Machinists union and the terminal pulsates with passengers,
digested and disgorged by Eastern jetliners.
   But beyond the unmarked doors, down corridors to offices and
employee lounges, a revolution is under way: Eastern is
transforming with youthful blood. About the only things unchanged
are the name and the blue-silver logo.
   Once heavily dependent on Florida tourism and Latin travel,
Eastern is redirecting its reach toward business passengers. The
airline's headquarters may be in Miami, but the most important
operation is now in Atlanta's Hartsfield International, one of the
world's busiest airports.
   Many employees are cherub-faced new hires. Some flight
attendants look barely out of their teens and a number of pilots
are in their 30s. They work for less money than their pre-strike
counterparts and harbor none of the labor bitterness that helped
drag Eastern down for years.
   To passengers, the ``new Eastern'' not only looks rejuvenated
but it's almost evangelical. New employees bubble with conviction
that they're on the ground floor of something big.
   Strike-scarred veterans say there's less bureaucratic bickering
within the airline now. Many say they're pulling together like a
team, helped partly by company-paid counseling aimed at overcoming
the bitterness caused by the strike.
   Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether the ``New Eastern,''
which lost $852.3 million last year, can survive. The unions have
been humbled but the airline has reasserted itself just as the
economy seems to be weakening, leaving even the strongest airlines
vulnerable.
   ``We face a much more sinister challenge now,'' said James
Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman in Atlanta who is an unofficial
historian of the airline. ``We've got to make it.''
   Like an aging jet, Eastern has been stripped and overhauled by
owner Frank Lorenzo with the sanction of a federal bankruptcy
judge. The airline filed for protection from creditors soon after
the strike began and has since sold $859.8 million in assets. The
workforce has been cut to about 20,000, vs. 28,000 before the
walkout.
   To Eastern's management however, the airline hasn't been gutted
as union leaders claim, but rejiggered, reshaped and rebuilt.
   ``Nobody's ever built an airline like this, this fast,'' said
Eastern vice president Harold Holt, highest-ranking manager in
Atlanta. He said expanding the Atlanta operation during the strike
was one of the more stressful tasks of his 40 years with the
company.
   ``You either remain calm or go nuts,'' he said. ``It's been
probably the worst period in my career and also the best.''
   For Holt, a soft-spoken Atlanta native, that period began March
4, 1989, when Eastern pilots and flight attendants walked out in
solidarity with the Machinists and grounded all flights.
   Holt and his colleagues scrambled to train replacement workers
to gradually rebuild the flight schedule, which went from 295 a day
to zero overnight in Atlanta alone and created havoc. In the early
days of the strike the managers hauled bags and cleaned planes,
while management pilots took over the cockpits.
   As the strike progressed, the Atlanta schedule was increased to
80 flights a day in July, 160 in August and 262 in September.
Eastern now has about 270 daily departures from Atlanta, and its
target is 315 by mid- to late 1990.
   Nearly a third of Eastern's workforce is based in Atlanta _
including about 1,000 pilots, 1,400 flight attendants, 750
mechanics and maintenance workers, 1,000 baggage handlers and 1,000
ticket agents, cleaners and other workers.
   ``Atlanta's going to be between 40 and 50 percent of Eastern
Airlines,'' Holt said.
   Systemwide, the ``new Eastern'' operates about 800 flights a day
to 86 cities. That will be cut sharply if the federal government
approves Eastern's agreement to sell its Latin American routes and
other assets to American Airlines for $471 million.
   The sale of those routes is a required condition for final
approval of a new reorganization agreement between Eastern and its
major creditors.
   Lorenzo recently pulled Eastern's healthier sister carrier
Continental Airlines into the bankruptcy fray in order to gain
acceptance from the big creditors for its reorganization plan.
Continental, like Eastern a subsidiary of Lorenzo's Texas Air
Corp., would be required to make some payments to Eastern's
creditors under the new plan.
   If the sale to American proceeds, the importance to Eastern of
Miami _ its Latin American hub _ will diminish still further.
Atlanta, the business center of the South, will become Eastern's
key market.
   It is in this city that uppity Eastern is going nose-to-nose
against staid Delta Air Lines _ the nation's fourth-largest carrier
and a dominant economic force in Atlanta, its home base.
   Eastern employees jokingly call an outdoor area of Hartsfield
separating the two airlines' facilities the ``demilitarized zone.''
They refer to Delta as ``the big bear across the terminal.''
   As Miami's role in Eastern's game plan shrinks, there is even
speculation that Eastern could sell its maintenance base there and
move more operations to Atlanta. This city's civic and business
leaders have been pressing Eastern to transfer everything here,
Holt said.
   Regardless of where Eastern concentrates its business, there is
little doubt that the rancorous worker-management relationship of
the pre-strike years has eased.
   At a recent daily briefing for about 30 Eastern pilots in
Atlanta, half the group was new and half were veterans of the
strike who had spent months walking picket lines.
   ``Let's face it, there's been a lot of divisions, there's been a
lot of trauma with these people,'' said Todd Jennings, Eastern's
director of flight operations in Atlanta. But he said the veterans
wanted to put the past behind them.
   ``The name Eastern's the same, but everything else is
different.''

   ABOARD EASTERN FLIGHT 103 (AP) _ It's breakfast time on a
weekday morning New York-to Atlanta flight, and the youthful cabin
crew is serving up some corporate boosterism along with the
rewarmed scrambled eggs.
   ``Eastern's name is built on their reputation,'' said a
21-year-old flight attendant who identified herself as Melody. She
said that reputation drew her to take her first job as a flight
attendant three months ago after working in the restaurant business.
   Flight 103 out of New York's LaGuardia Airport is nearly full,
the passengers a mix of business travelers and leisure fliers. But
even the new enthusiasm doesn't help the Boeing 727 buck the lineup
of planes waiting to take off: the 9:05 departure isn't airborne
until 9:35.
   Melody's colleagues on the flight, Carlos Cardenas and Cody
Fulmer, also are young, enthusiastic and relatively new to Eastern.
They are the flip side of the bitter strike against Eastern, which
began a year ago and threw thousands of pilots, flight attendants
and Machinists out of work.
   For the newcomers, the dispute that pitted the unions against
Eastern owner Frank Lorenzo was an opportunity.
   ``I wanted to become a flight attendant so bad,'' said Cardenas,
23, who before the strike had worked for Eastern in Bogota,
Colombia, as a ticket agent and reservation agent.
   As part of Lorenzo's cost-cutting strategy, the airline has
hired thousands of new employees at lower pay to replace the union
strikers. Many of the replacement workers are young, single,
without families and mortgages to support _ and not especially
receptive to trade unionism.
   Eastern flight attendants, for example, now earn an average
$1,688 a month, down from $2,029 before the strike.
   ``It's just like any other job; you've got to work your way
up,'' Melody replied when asked if she resented the relatively low
wages.
   Insiders estimate that the new employees have cut about 10 years
off the average age of Eastern's work force of 20,000: from the
mid-40s to the mid-30s. The minimum age for Eastern flight
attendants is 18.
   Even the uniforms for flight attendants are new: navy blue with
gold stripes on the sleeves, described as a more professional look
replacing the old khaki-colored outfits and red scarves. Female
attendants also wear a military-style kepi reminiscent of
stewardess uniforms in the mid-1950s: some say the jaunty caps make
them an easy target for the jeers of Machinist pickets at airports.
   Breakfast on Flight 103 is scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes,
tiny sausages, orange juice and a small blueberry muffin. (In first
class, it's fancier and includes an omelette and fresh fruit salad.)
   In the cockpit, there's a mix of Eastern veterans and newcomers.
   The captain, Jon McClure, has flown for Eastern 22 years. He
stayed out for six months before crossing the picket line to return
to work.
   McClure is flying this trip with co-pilot Phil Gibson, 42, and
flight engineer Dan Marouf, 34, both hired after the strike started.
   ``I wanted to get this company going; I wanted to be part of a
team,'' said Gibson, who had flown corporate jets for five years
before joining Eastern last June. ``I'm not here for the short
term. I plan to make this a career.''
   McClure, calling the strike ``ill-conceived,'' said that now,
new and old pilots are working well together and all the employees
are hustling more than before. Asked about Eastern's future
prospects, he gazed out the cockpit window at a distant point:
``I'm optimistic, but it could go either way.''

   Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford said
Wednesday that officials of the seven largest industrial countries
met in London this week, but he refused to confirm a report that
Japan had requested help in stabilizing the value of the Japanese
currency.
   ``I can't answer questions about current exchange rates,''
Mulford told reporters after an appearance before a congressional
panel. He said he attended the Tuesday meeting.
   Mulford was asked about a report by a Japanese news organization
that officials in that country had asked other major industrial
countries to keep the yen from falling further.
   The Kyodo News Service, quoting a Finance Ministry source, said
Japan made the request at a meeting of deputy finance minsters from
the industrial countries, which are known as the Group of Seven.
   The seven governments _ the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada _ often work together to buy and
sell currencies on the open market to influence their price.
   The yen has been declining rapidly against the dollar in recent
weeks, threatening to ignite inflation in Japan. A decline in the
yen also risks worsening the U.S. trade deficit by making American
goods more expensive and Japanese goods cheaper.
   The dollar gained against the yen Wednesday, closing at 149.08
yen in New York, compared with 148.73 yen on Tuesday.
   Mulford confirmed for reporters that he had attended a G-7
deputies meeting in London on Tuesday. Other sources had said the
session was with officials at Mulford's level and not at the
ministerial level although Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady was
also in London Tuesday.
   While refusing to confirm that stabilizing the Japanese yen was
on the agenda, Mulford said the group did discuss establishment of
a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to help foster
emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   He said he hoped that the bank could begin operating by the end
of this year but that there was no assurance that this timetable
could be met.
   At Wednesday's hearing of a House Banking Committee task force,
Mulford said the G-7 countries have been successfully coordinating
their domestic policies to foster global prosperity.
   Mulford told the lawmakers he could not make a statement on the
controversial issue of whether the Soviet Union should be allowed
to borrow from the new bank.
   ``We're still in the process of learning from what we've
heard,'' he said.
   The Bush administration had been reported earlier as opposing
loans from the bank to the Soviet Union, while other donor
governments wanted to permit them.
   Mulford said the administration is anxious to set up special
standards for loans that are not required by other development
banks: requirements that borrowers move toward democracy,
pluralism, free political parties, elections, the rule of law,
human rights and open, market-based economies.
   He said the U.S. government wants to join the bank and its first
concern is how to finance the transition from Communism to
economies based on markets. He suggested that if the bank lends
chiefly to governments it may promote the existing situation rather
than contribute to changing it.

   The first Boeing 737-500, the latest version of

Wednesday to Southwest Airlines.
   Boeing said the 104-passenger plane was flown to Dallas, where
the regional carrier is based, 16 days after receiving flight
certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Nineteen customers have ordered a totak 193 737-500s, which cost
roughly $25 million each.
   As of last Thursday, total orders for all models of the
twin-engine 737, Boeing's smallest jetliner, amounted to 2,771
planes, said T. Craig Martin of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
   The more quiet, efficient and technologically advanced 737-500
replaces the 737-100 and 737-200 versions, which made their first
flights in 1967, Martin said.
   Production of the first two models ended after 1,144 were
delivered, the last a 737-200 for Xiamen Airlines of China on Aug.

<HEAD>Indictment Could Mean Exxon's Costs For Alaska Spill Will Multiply</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regardless of whether Exxon Corp. ever goes to
trial on criminal charges, the oil giant's indictment in connection
with its Alaska oil spill could cause Exxon's disaster-related
expenses to snowball beyond the $2 billion it already has spent,
experts said Wednesday.
   Dan Riesel, an environmental attorney with the law firm Sive,
Paget &amp; Riesel, said a number of outcomes are possible in the Exxon
case, including an eventual dismissal of the charges.
   In the event of a conviction or a plea bargain, however,
criminal proceedings against Exxon could benefit those who have
filed civil lawsuits and swell Exxon's financial burden, said
Riesel, a former environmental prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's
office in New York.
   ``If Exxon is forced to articulate what it did in a plea bargain
process it makes life awfully simple for private plaintiffs and
very difficult for Exxon,'' Riesel said. ``Those are admissions and
admissions can be used in another proceeding to prove liability.''
   A federal grand jury in Alaska handed up a five-count criminal
indictment against Exxon on Tuesday for counts stemming from the
oil spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez after it hit a reef last March
24 in Alaska's Prince William Sound. The spill of 11 million
gallons of oil soiled over 1,000 miles of coastline and killed
thousands of fish, birds and other animals.
   More than 160 civil lawsuits are pending against Exxon by the
State of Alaska, environmentalists and private individuals for
unspecified damages.
   The criminal outcome also could result in fines totaling twice
the loss to the victim, in this case what it cost to restore the
environment to its condition prior to the spill, Riesel said.
   ``If measured by the cost of rebuilding the ecosystem, then
we're talking an astronomical sum _ billions,'' he said.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl said Tuesday that Exxon already has
spent more than $2 billion in cleanup costs and has paid out more
than $180 million to 13,000 fishermen and other claimants.
   The company took $1.68 billion in charges against 1989 earnings
to cover what it said was both current and estimated future costs
for cleanup, environmental and legal expenses.
   Nevertheless, Tuesday's indictment raised uncertainty about what
Exxon's final responsibility would be in the spill.
   Justice Department officials said the indictment could result in
penalties of $700 million or more. But analysts said actual
financial impact to the oil giant remained too uncertain to
quantify, because Exxon failed to reach a settlement over possible
criminal charges.
   Exxon reportedly had been negotiating a plea agreement with the
Justice Department that would have involved the creation of a $500
million environmental restoration fund.
   ``I doubt it will cost more than what Exxon has already put
out,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, equities analyst with Gruntal
Investment Research. He said, however, ``It's not altogether clear
to what extent there will be extraordinary expenses arising from
the indictment.''
   ``The absence of a plea bargain only keeps the uncertainty,''
said Frank P. Knuettel, analyst for Prudential Bache Securities Inc.
   Knuettel and other analysts say the company's enormous size
insulates it from the financial impact of the spill.
   ``Exxon is wealthier than a hundred countries in the U.N.,''
said Knuettel.
   Exxon's stock dropped $1.37{ to $47 on the New York Stock
Exchange, in what analysts called a temporary, ``knee-jerk''
reaction to the indictment, which was announced after the market
closed Tuesday. The stock generally was expected to improve in 1990.
   Battipaglia noted the stock remained above the $45 range in
which it was trading before the spill. Exxon stock has been
relatively flat since the spill.
   Another uncertainty is the outcome of the trial in Alaska of
Joseph Hazelwood, former captain of the Exxon Valdez at the time of
the spill.
   Hazelwood, charged with a felony, criminal mischief and three
misdemeanors, is the only person charged criminally in the tanker
grounding.
   Analysts said the amount of damages sought in civil lawsuits
likely would climb if Hazelwood is convicted. Many of the lawsuits
do not yet specify a damage amount.

the United States but has no plans to pull out of the market, the
head of the West German company's U.S. operations said Wednesday.
   ``We are well loved, but we are not well purchased,'' said
William J. Young, vice president of Volkswagen United States Inc.
``We have to act better than our performance. We have to become
leaders again.''
   The company's share of the U.S. market is about 1 percent, its
dealer network dropped from 840 to 790 outlets last year and it is
nowhere near achieving its goal of selling 200,000 cars in the U.S.
this year, Young said.
   He said he's pinning Volkswagen's hopes on ``Fahrvergnugen,''
which loosely translates to ``driving pleasure.'' Volkswagen is
using the word and a stick figure logo in its advertising in an
attempt to lure curious consumers into showrooms.
   In addition to the advertising campaign using the unique word,
Volkswagen has broken ranks with its U.S. counterparts and pulled
out of the incentive wars. Volkswagen and BMW, another West German
automaker, have lowered prices on some of their 1990 model cars
instead of offering cash rebates or low-interest financing deals.
   ``The value of rebates is wearing out,'' Young said. ``The other
side of the equation is: What do you do if you don't have them?''
   ``You do the same thing as when you didn't have them _ and when
you didn't have them you had a better business,'' he said.
   Young took a swipe at the U.S. Big Three automakers, saying they
don't get involved in long-term planning. Volkswagen executives, he
said, are making long-term plans.
   ``What they are saying is, let's develop a long-term strategy so
we don't put our heads in the sand like some of the manufacturers
in the U.S. market,'' Young said.
   Young's comments came during the company's U.S. introduction of
its Passat mid-size sedan.

   The stock market moved broadly higher Wednesday
and blue chips managed to extend this week's winning streak.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which rose 52.93 points
over the prior two sessions, gained an additional 10.13 to close at
2,627.25.
   The key indicator's advance came despite heavy selling in Exxon
stock in the wake of the company's indictment on criminal charges
related to last March's oil spill off the Alaskan coast.
   Periodic rounds of profit-taking pared down the increase in the
Dow Jones industrial average. It stood more than 20 points higher
at midday before traders decided to sell to collect profits.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 8 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
917 up, 565 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board swelled to 184.41 million
shares from 152.59 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 218.55 million shares.
   Market watchers said stocks continued to benefit from improved
investor confidence stemming from Wall Street's ability to
withstand a recent slump in Tokyo without suffering any apparent
ill effects.
   A continuing recovery in Tokyo from Monday's steep plunge
reinforced the positive tone while an upward revision in the
government's estimate of economic activity also helped.
   The government's latest reading on the economy came out before
the market opened and it showed the gross national product grew at
a 0.9 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 1989, faster
than the 0.5 percent pace previously estimated but still the
slowest in more than three years.
   The Commerce Department said its revised estimate of
October-December growth means the GNP _ the nation's total output
of goods and services _ rose 3 percent for all of 1989. That was
the slowest yearly advance since a 2.7 percent gain in 1986 and
followed a 4.4 percent increase in 1988.
   Analysts said the stock market could bump into resistence due to
worries about how corporate profits will fare in the face of a
prolonged period of sluggish economic growth.
   Among active blue chips, International Business Machines rose &lsqb;
to 103~, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph added &lsqb; to 39}, General
Electric, moved ahead \ to 61} and General Motors finished off &lsqb; at
44~.
   Exxon, another component of the Dow Jones industrial average,
tumbled 1&rsqb; to 47.
   American Express jumped 1 to 29&lsqb;, also in brisk trading. Boeing
climbed 2\ to 63~.
   Future Germany Fund, the newest addition to the growing ranks of
single-country mutual funds, led the list of active NYSE stocks on
volume of more than 8.6 million shares. The stock closed at 19\ on
its first day of trading, above the $18-a-share price for its
initial offering of 12.5 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $18.27 billion, or
0.57 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
closed 0.91 higher at 183.07.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.60 to 382.02, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 1.63 to 331.89.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market moved
3.22 higher to 425.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index ended the session at 352.90, up 1.50.

<HEAD>Poling To Begin 3-Year Stint as Ford Chairman</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBs 2nd graf pvs, The 64-year-old...to CORRECT age of

<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Poling begins a three-year term as
chairman of Ford Motor Co. on Thursday, a stint some analysts say
appears to be a caretaker role while the next chairman is groomed
for office.
   The 64-year-old Poling, who is vice chairman and chief operating
officer, succeeds Donald Petersen, 63, as chairman and chief
executive.
   Petersen and Poling have worked closely for the past decade _
during which Ford changed from a struggling, overweight giant that
lost $1.5 billion in 1980 to a much leaner company that earned an
industry record $5.3 billion eight years later.
   The relatively limited time Poling will head the company is
considered unusual by management standards.
   ``It's often the case when there has been some kind of trauma,''
said Edward Bowman, deputy dean of the University of Pennsylvania's
Wharton School. ``The especially unusual thing about it is that
Ford is in especially good shape.''
   Bowman, who concentrates his research on chief executive
positions, said the Ford board of directors' election of Poling to
a limited term as chairman ``would imply that they weren't quite
ready in terms of succession planning, that they weren't ready to
name somebody else for a normal term.''
   Most of the speculation for a longer-term chief executive
officer in the mid-1990s and beyond has centered on Allan Gilmour,
a Ford executive vice president who on Thursday adds the title of
president of the Ford Automotive Group.
   Petersen joined Ford in 1949 and held a variety of positions in
domestic and international product planning, design and marketing
before he became president. Poling's Ford career began in 1951 and
focused mainly on the financial side of the corporation.
   Petersen has been credited with freeing designers and engineers
in the early 1980s to work together in developing the Ford Taurus
and Mercury Sable cars of the mid-1980s, which helped lift Ford
from the financial doldrums.
   ``I really think that Petersen made the necessary adjustments in
the product plan,'' auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
of New York. ``The key addition he made was to leave product
planning to the product planners.''
   Poling would do well to follow that lead, Brady said.
   ``I think he's got to challenge (product planners) with the
charge that this is a very intensely competitive game,'' he said.
``That's all he's got to do in the product area.''
   Bowman said, ``I think he (Poling) would be a nut in that
three-year period to mess with any product decisions.''
   Poling has his work cut out for him.
   The U.S. auto industry is in the depths of a recession that
began in October. Companies are wrestling with a way to wean
American consumers from rebates and other incentives that have
become ingrained in car buying and are eroding profits.
   Each of the nation's Big Three automakers, General Motors Corp.,
Ford and Chrysler Corp., are taking steps to eliminate costs and
steamline operations, with GM and Chrysler imposing plant shutdowns
and layoffs.
   Brady said Poling can leave his mark by raising productivity at
Ford.
   ``If he can follow through with the productivity increase while
the programs continue in the Petersen manner, it will be one of the
best one-two punches of all time,'' Brady said.
   Poling will become the fourth company chairman who was not a
member of the Ford family. The two Fords now in company management
are cousins William C. Ford Jr., 32, who heads the company's
marketing staff, and Edsel Ford II, 41, directors of heavy truck
engineering and manufacturing. Both are great-grandsons of company
founder Henry Ford.

   Two key prosecution witnesses in the stock
manipulation case against the chairman of now-defunct Haas
Securities Corp. were sentenced Wednesday to prison terms of one
and three years.
   The sentencings of former Haas president Stanley Aslanian Jr.
and Henry Lorin, a stock promoter, came one day after Haas chairman
Eugene Laff was sentenced to five years in prison for manipulating
the prices of three over-the-counter stocks.
   Lorin, 48, who was the president of Henlor Capital Ltd.,
received the three-year prison term from U.S. District Judge Thomas
P. Griesa, who said Lorin played a key role in the scheme.
   Aslanian, 31, was sentenced to one year in prison and two years
probation by another federal judge, Shirley Wohl Kram. Kram said
Aslanian's cooperation had been ``meaningful and extensive.''
   Lorin and Aslanian, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges,
both testified at Laff's trial, which ended in December with his
conviction on five counts of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and obstruction of justice.
   The case against Laff stemmed from the government's first fraud
investigation after the 1987 market crash. Haas Securities, a
brokerage house, collapsed nine days after the crash.
   The prosecution maintained that the firm's scheme to
artificially raise the prices of penny stocks _ inexpensive
securities traded over the counter _ couldn't be maintained after
the market dropped and the share prices fell.
   Laff was convicted of being part of a scheme to artificially
inflate the penny stock prices by creating a false demand for the
shares and then selling out his firm's own stake before the prices
collapsed.
   The stock involved in the scheme were Big O Tires Inc., Flores
de New Mexico and T.S. Industries Inc.
   Lorin is to surrender on April 11 and Aslanian on March 28.

   The dollar rose against most major currencies
Wednesday after the government reported the nation's economy grew
at a faster-than-expected rate in the fourth quarter of 1989.
   The dollar traded at an eight-month high against the Japanese
yen for the third day despite central bank intervention. Traders
said continued concern about the Tokyo stock market depressed the
yen.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid for gold at $406.10 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m.
EST, down $2.15 from late Tuesday.
   The Commerce Department said the U.S. economy grew by 0.9
percent in 1989's fourth quarter, faster than previously estimated
but still the slowest pace in more than three years.
   The revised GNP figure supported the dollar, but was not a major
factor because it is a historic number, said Hubert Pedroli,
foreign exchange manager for Credit Suisse in New York.
   ``It only gives us a small indication of what we can expect for
1990, but still, it's an indication in the sense of sustained
growth, not recession,'' he said.
   Pedroli said concern remained about the slump in the Tokyo stock
market despite its improvement Wednesday.
   ``There's still a cloud of uncertainty over there so the yen
continues to be weak,'' he said.
   The Federal Reserve sold dollars in New York to support the yen
when it reached the 149.10 level, but the intervention only had a
temporary impact, traders said.
   The dollar was boosted against the West German mark by
speculation that a plan to unite the currencies of East and West
Germany would produce inflation, traders said.
   The dollar lost strength as it began its day in Tokyo, falling
0.51 yen to 148.52 yen. But in London, the dollar was quoted higher
at 148.75 yen. Later, in New York, the dollar rose to 149.08 yen,
up from 148.73 late Tuesday.
   The dollar has not closed that high against the yen in New York
since June 15, when it reached 151.30 yen.
   The dollar also gained strength against the British pound. In
London, the pound fetched $1.6895, cheaper than $1.6915 late
Tuesday. In New York, it traded at $1.6752, down from $1.6908 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7074 West German marks, up from 1.6880; 1.5010
Swiss francs, up from 1.4840; 5.7695 French francs, up from 5.7150;
1,260.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.75; and 1.1927 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1938.
   Late rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's prices,
included: 1.4900 Swiss francs, up from 1.4857; 5.7300 French
francs, up from 5.7010; 1.9070 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8985;
1,250.00 Italian lire, up from 1,245.25; and 1.2072 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1908.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
dropped $1.90 a troy ounce to $406.10.
   Earlier, gold traded in London at a late bid price of $407.90 a
troy ounce, up from $407.25 bid late Tuesday. But in Zurich, the
metal fell to a bid price of $407.79 from $411.25 Tuesday. In Hong
Kong, gold rose $1.07 to close at a bid $408.92.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.10 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.11. In New York, silver for current delivery rose
to $5.127 an ounce from $5.075 Tuesday on the Commodity Exchange.

<HEAD>Soybean Oil Futures Surge To 7-Month High On Technicals, Strong
Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean oil futures bounded to 7{-month highs Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by bullish chart signals and
stronger domestic demand for soybean oil as an alternative to other
fats.
   The rally helped pull soybean futures higher. Corn futures also
advanced in Chicago while most wheat futures retreated.
   On other commodity markets, petroleum futures slipped; precious
metals were mixed; cattle futures advanced and pork futures were
mixed.
   Soybean oil settled .20 cent to .65 cent higher in Chicago with
the contract for delivery in March up .56 cent at 21.22 cents a
pound, the highest settlement for a near-month contract since July
7.
   Soybean futures finished 5 cents to 7{ cents higher with March
at $5.66{ a bushel; wheat futures were 1{ cents lower to { cent
higher with March at $3.93\ a bushel; corn futures were 1 cent to 2
cents higher with March at $2.47 a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 4}
cents higher with March at $1.41\ a bushel.
   Soybean oil has been trending higher since Feb. 9, when the
Agriculture Department released a report indicating U.S. stocks of
soybean oil are shrinking.
   Soybean oil opened higher, extending Tuesday's late gains, then
faltered at midday only to soar toward the close after the May
contract's price broke through resistance at 21.10 cents a pound.
   The rally appeared to be inspired more by chart signals than
supply-and-demand factors, although analysts linked some of the
buying to Taiwan's overnight purchase of 23,000 metric tons of
soybeans, talk of Iraqi interest in U.S. soybean meal and
perceptions that soybean-crushing activity is slowing.
   After the close, the USDA announced a sale of 23,000 metric tons
of soybean oil to Pakistan.
   Analyst Walter Spilka of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
attributed most of the increased demand for soybean oil to domestic
users, including food processors, in the wake of research linking
imported alternatives such as palm oil and coconut oil to higher
blood cholesterol levels.
   ``Last year we had a lot of imports of tropical oils but a lot
of bakers have now stopped using tropical oils,'' Spilka said.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseeds analysts with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said some buying interest may have been stirred by
the soybean market's failure to fall during February below its
January lows, defying ``a well-known seasonal pattern.''
   ``That didn't happen this year and I think it gave the bulls
more confidence,'' she said.
   Petroleum futures sank on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
extending Tuesday's losses, following the American Petroleum
Institute's weekly inventory report showing increased U.S. supplies
of gasoline for the seventh week in a row.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents to 25 cents
lower with April at $21.54 a barrel; heating oil was .70 cent to
1.26 cents lower with March at 57.32 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .10 cent to 1.80 cents lower with March at 55.76 cents
a gallon.
   Gold futures fell for the sixth straight day on New York's
Commodity Exchange as stock prices firmed but silver futures
advanced, partly recovering from Tuesday's slump to 4{-month lows.
   Gold futures finished $1.80 to $2.10 lower with April at $408.90
a troy ounce; silver was 3.6 cents to 5.2 cents higher with March
at $5.127 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures firmed amid expectations for stronger cash
markets. Pork futures ended mixed after rallying early in the
session on rumors that the United States was on the verge of
subsidizing sales of pork to the Soviet Union.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter denied that the United
States had made such an offer.
   Live cattle futures settled .08 cent to .27 cent higher with
April at 75.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .40
cent higher with March at 80.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .10
cent lower to .53 cent higher with April at 50.35 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
March at 51.35 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell Wednesday in a second
straight day of declines.
   Analysts attributed the sell-off to bearish sentiment on the
final day of trading for March contracts, the apparent onset of
warmer weather and high inventories, particularly in heating oil.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the key grade of
U.S. crude oil, lost 4 cents to close at $21.54 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after falling 21 cents a barrel
on Tuesday. Later contracts also finished up to 25 cents lower
Wednesday.
   Refined products traded on the New York Merc also fell.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for delivery in March, which declined
2.27 cent a gallon Tuesday, fell another 1.80 cents to 55.76 cents
a gallon. Later contracts had smaller losses.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery fell 0.84 cent a gallon,
after dropping 0.89 cent on Moday. Later contracts were down by
larger amounts.
   John Hill, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures, said
unleaded gasoline was hardest hit Wednesday because of high stocks.
``People are basically saying there's not much room for storage,''
he said.
   Part of the decline in heating oil prices was attributed to
warmer weather that is decreasing demand for the product amid high
investories. Hill also said traders expected crude oil prices to
crack a technical low level of $21.40 but rose during the day
because of some buying interest.

<HEAD>T.J. Maxx Owner Reports Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRAMINGHAM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TJX Cos. Inc. reported Tuesday that the
success of its T.J. Maxx off-price retail stores contributed
largely to a 49 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit.
   For the quarter that ended Jan. 27, the company earned $25.18
million, or 36 cents per share, on sales of $618.6 million,
compared with earnings of $16.8 million, or 30 cents per share, on
sales of $567.2 million in the previous fourth quarter.
   TJX operates 352 T.J. Maxx and 546 Hit or Miss stores across the
country, and also owns the Chadwick's of Boston mail order business.
   Bernard Cammarata, the company president, said in a statement
that T.J. Maxx contributed largely to the company's success, while
Hit or Miss had a ``disappointing'' second half, especially the
fourth quarter.
   ``As a specialty store retailer using limited advertising, Hit
or Miss found it difficult to overcome the unprecedented level of
promotions that prevailed in the fourth quarter,'' he said.
   For the full year, sales rose 11.9 percent to $2.1 billion from
$1.9 billion.
   The company had net income of $93.8 million, or $1.43 per share,
for the last fiscal year, compared with a loss of $167.8 million,
or $2.97 per share, the previous year that stemmed from the
company's sale of its Zayre stores to Ames Department Stores Inc.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key target in a federal securities probe
involving penny stock brokerage founder Meyer Blinder has pleaded
guilty and agreed to testify for the government.
   Authorities said Salt Lake City businessman Michael D. Wright,
30, agreed to cooperate in the prosecution of Blinder, who was
indicted last week on charges of manipulating securities in a
multibillion-dollar stock swindle. The indictment charges Blinder,
69, of Denver, and four others with conspiring to engage in
fraudulent securities trading practices through the firm Blinder,
Robinson &amp; Co., once the nation's largest penny stock brokerage.
   Wright pleaded guilty to three counts of securities fraud. He is
to be sentenced May 17.
   His partner, Arnold L. Kimmes, pleaded guilty to racketeering
charges last March and has cooperated with investigators from the
Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Authorities said Kimmes and Wright formed ``blind pools,''
companies with no assets or corporate history, and paid nominees to
list their names as puppet directors.
   Lawyers and accountants allegedly provided audited financial
statements for the businesses, giving the appearance that they were
real, according to the plea agreement dated Feb. 22.
   The companies then were registered with the SEC, and phony
offerings were staged with puppet shareholders who bought shares
with money supplied by Wright and Kimmes, authorities said.
   Government authorities contend Blinder controlled the stock
supply and demand, using high-pressure sales tactics to peddle the
stocks.

   Robert E. Lee is plotting an offensive this
spring in Tennessee. But instead of leading a fight between
Confederate and Union troops, Lee's battle involves spirits.
   Bob Lee IV, great-grandson of the Civil War general, is in the
liquor business.
   As chairman of the tiny, privately owned A. Smith Bowman Inc.
distillery, Lee is taking on a much bigger foe on the opposition's
home turf _ Tennessee-based Jack Daniel _ in a bid to double sales
of Bowman's Virginia Gentleman bourbon in that state.
   Lee, 65, has a military leader's reluctance to tell too much.
Exactly what is meant by ``double sales?'' He won't say.
   But he admits his company isn't setting out to become an
industry giant. ``We don't need a lot of sales to show an increase
because we're not going against a million cases,'' he said.
   In Virginia, however, Lee's company is as big as his family's
name.
   ``We are the No. 1 alcoholic beverage label in the state,'' he
said.
   That ranking was achieved largely because of Bowman's Virginia
Vodka, which sells about 150,000 cases a year in the state. Bowman
also has just gone international with an order from Poland for
50,000 cases of vodka, the largest single order for one product in
the company's history.
   Bowman's mainstay, Virginia Gentleman bourbon, is No. 2 in the
state behind national leader Jim Beam. Virginia Gentleman also is
sold in seven other states from Pennsylvania to North Carolina and
a pocket in Atlanta.
   Two years ago, Bowman introduced its own gin, which now accounts
for about 12,000 cases a year.
   Lee is a born salesman whose accent reflects his New York roots.
His father was a Columbia University-educated doctor who practiced
in the city.
   But Lee was sent to private school in Virginia and in 1949
graduated Washington &amp; Lee University in Lexington, where his
great-grandfather served as president after the Civil War.
   After college, he moved to the West Coast and became an
advertising executive for the San Francisco Chronicle. Twenty years
ago, Lee joined Bowman when his brother-in-law, A. Smith Bowman
Jr., asked him to take over sales and marketing duties at the
company founded in 1935 by Bowman's father, A. Smith Bowman Sr.
   ``I basically like sales,'' said Lee, whose first decision at
Bowman was to hire a public relations executive and begin traveling
around the state to give civic club speeches and newspaper and
television interviews to promote Virginia Gentleman.
   ``I went down to Lynchburg one time and was on a cooking show,''
he said. ``I'd never cooked in my life. But we did it for half an
hour and gave away recipes. It was fun.''
   Lee, who eventually succeeded the Bowmans as chairman of the
nation's oldest family-owned independent bourbon distillery, also
played a role in the decision to diversify the firm's products.
   ``Here we had one product, bourbon,'' he said. ``Nationally,
bourbon was not going anywhere.''
   Bourbon's share of the liquor market dwindled from 14 percent in
1978 to 10.8 percent in 1988. But the trend was evident early on,
and Bowman got into the vodka business in 1982, Lee said.
   When the company's vodka went on the market, it got a boost from
then-Gov. Charles S. Robb, who launched his ``We Have it Made in
Virginia'' campaign at the same time. ``That was pure luck,'' Lee
said.
   The company's gin came out two years ago. While Lee has been
searching for new directions to take the company, Bowman is not
ready to become a major national player in the liquor field, he
said.
   Although sales of bourbon are slumping nationally, Lee said
there are still plenty of bourbon drinkers to woo away from
competitors.
   A dozen years ago, Bowman entered into a partnership with a
wholesaler in Florida and Texas and attempted for 18 months to sell
Virginia Gentleman in those two states. ``It just didn't work,''
Lee said.
   ``So having done that, we realize we can't go big league like
Jim Beam,'' he said. ``We never would have known if we hadn't
tried.''
   Lee keeps a small bust of Gen. Lee in his office, but most of
the family decorations are related to his children, including son
Robert E. Lee V, who teaches at a nearby private school.
   Lee said people always want to hear stories about his
great-grandfather.
   ``But we don't have any special anecdotes in the family about
General Lee,'' he said. ``One of the major reasons is that
everybody got married late in life. My father never knew his
grandfather, and my father was in his 50s when I was born.
   ``We had a sense of history, but we didn't have anybody sitting
in someone's lap telling about something that wasn't in Dr.
Freeman's or Bruce Catton's books,'' Lee said of the Pulitzer
Prize-winning biography of his great-grandfather by Douglas
Southall Freeman and works by Civil War historian Catton. ``That's
just the way it was.''
   What Lee has in mind for the Tennessee offensive is a taste
test, a battle of the bourbons. ``It's going to be Kentucky vs.
Tennessee vs. Virginia,'' he said.
   How far is he willing to go to win?
   ``A Southern gentleman will go to any lengths to maintain the
family honor,'' according to a Bowman brochure. ``A Virginia
gentleman will go only to honorable lengths.''

   Toyota Motor Corp. and Ford Motor Co. on
Wednesday recalled some of their mid-1980s cars because of
potential cruise control and emissions problems.
   Toyota spokeswoman Deborah Sanchez-Fair said about 120,000
1983-84 model Camrys and 1984-model Corollas were being recalled
because of a cruise control problem that could cause high engine
speed.
   The automaker said it was aware of no accidents or injuries
because of the problem.
   Meanwhile, Ford said it was recalling about 16,000 1986 Ford
Escort and EXP and Mercury Lynx cars made for sale in California.
   The company said emissions from the cars, all equipped with
1.9-liter engines and automatic transmissions, exceed maximum
levels for hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen set by the
California Air Resources Board.
   Cars made for sale in California have different emission-control
systems than cars sold elsewhere.
   Owners of cars in both recalls will be notified by mail and
alterations will be performed free.

   The union representing Greyhound Lines Inc. bus
drivers offered little hope Wednesday that a Friday strike could be
averted although low-level talks with management continued.
   ``There has been progress in some areas, but very little
progress in others,'' said Edward M. Strait, president of the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions. ``It will be very
difficult to achieve our objective _ a fair and equitable contract
_ by the March 2 deadline.''
   A union spokesman declined to say where progress had been made
and which issues remained unresolved.
   The union, which represents 6,300 bus drivers and 3,075 of the
company's office and maintenance workers, has called a strike for
12:01 a.m. Friday, one minute after the current three-year contract
expires.
   Dallas-based Greyhound, which operates the only nationwide
intercity bus system, has said it will continue to run a limited
schedule if the drivers strike, with plans to build back to full
operations by the end of March.
   Full scale negotiations between the two sides ended last week,
although low-level meetings resumed over the weekend in Scottsdale,
Ariz. Strait said the current talks were moving at a slow pace.
   In a statement, Greyhound Executive Vice President P. Anthony
Lannie said the union's demand were ``far above the average of
company-union negotiated settlements of the last two years.'
   Greyhound officials declined to comment on the union's remarks,
citing an ongoing news blackout covering the talks.
   The company has said it cannot afford more than the $63 million,
three-year pact it is offering. Greyhound estimates the union's
proposal would cost $406 million over the life of the contract.
   Greyhound says it earned about $730,000 on about $1 billion in
revenue last year, the first profit since the company was formed in
1987 through the $350 million purchases of Greyhound and Trailways
Lines Inc.
   Prior to the buyout, the union agreed to a 22 percent wage cut,
and the company has said the current offer is an attempt to regain
that money before the company is able to pay.
   ``Those people that you owe or will owe money to don't
acknowledge that your pay has been cut by 25 percent,'' said union
spokesman Jeffrey Nelson. ``It's a difficult situation.''
   Although the negotiations are the first since Currey purchased
the company, Greyhound went through two acrimonious strikes while
still a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Greyhound Corp.
   A 1983 strike lasted 48 days and was ``an extremely difficult
strike,'' Nelson said. There also was a four-day strike in 1974.
   ``These people know what it's like to go on strike,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fisher-Price Toys To Close Plant, Lay Off 450</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST AURORA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisher-Price said Wednesday it would
close a toy manufacturing plant in the town where the company was
founded 60 years ago and lay off 450 employees.
   Fisher-Price executive vice president David B. Fisher said the
layoffs would begin May 15 and the East Aurora plant should be
closed by July 1.
   ``This decision will lower our costs and improve our position in
this very competitive market place,'' Fisher said.
   Fisher-Price, the world's largest maker of infant and preschool
toys and juvenile products, said it would keep its corporate
headquarters in this village outside Buffalo and plants in Medina
and Holland, also in upstate New York.
   High inventories, production delays, higher costs and supply
problems over the last year have hampered Fisher-Price, which
posted a $9.5 million operating loss in the final quarter of 1989.
   Fisher said he expects the company to be ``marginally profitable
at best'' in 1990.
   Overall sales were $800 million in 1989, and Fisher-Price still
has an excellent reputation among its customers. A recent national
survey of buyer attitudes on product quality rated Fisher-Price
toys third behind Mercedes Benz autos and Eastman-Kodak photo
products.
   Reports over the last week have indicated that Fisher-Price
would be sold by parent Quaker Oats Co. of Chicago, but Quaker
Chairman William D. Smithburg said last week that Fisher-Price was
not now on the block.
   About 1,000 people work at corporate headquarters and 2,000 more
at the other plants. Fisher-Price employs about 10,000 people
worldwide.
   None of those laid off, who are semi-skilled workers making $8
to $9 an hour, will be offered jobs at other Fisher-Price
operations.
   The East Aurora plant, which began operation in 1951, makes
Fisher-Price's Little People playsets, Bubble Mower and Magic Vac.
Those operations will be transferred to the Medina plant and a
plant in Murray, Ky.
   Fisher said the East Aurora plant is the least efficient the
company owns because it does not have fabrication, assembly and
plastic molding capability in one building.

   Innovations expected to propel the manufacturing
industry into the future, including video headsets and floating
concrete, are on display at the National Design Engineering Show
and Conference.
   About 25,000 engineers are expected to converge on Chicago's
lakefront McCormick Place through Thursday to see new designs from
companies such as Dow Chemical Co. and Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing Co. _ even NASA.
   Many of the products and materials on display represent minor
advances _ a fiber that resists fading just a bit longer, for
example. Nevertheless, consumers will feel the effect of the new
technology.
   ``You and I, ultimately, in some way will be related or involved
with every single product in this show, whether it's paint on an
automobile or the spring in the seat or the knobs to turn on your
hi-fi,'' said Robert Rosaler, director of an engineering conference
sponsored by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in
conjunction with the show.
   Some new products debuting at the show take a broader step into
the future.
   For example, a Massachusetts company is showing a miniature
video display monitor slightly larger than a lipstick. Through the
use of a magnifying lens, the one-inch display window produces an
image that looks as though it is on a 12-inch screen.
   ``This is basically the walkman of the future. It's a
videoman,'' said Raymond Hoffer, a representative of Reflection
Technology of Waltham, Mass.
   By Christmas, the mini video monitor is due to appear in stores
as a component in a 5-by-2 inch paperless pocket fax machine, said
Neil Golden, director of sales for Reflection Technology.
   The 2-ounce terminal can display 25 lines of 80 characters each
on a red-and-black screen. It can attach to a headband that
positions the video screen a few inches in front of the eyes,
allowing a person to look up information while leaving the hands
free to work.
   At least eight other companies plan to use Reflection
Technology's monitor in products including a 5-by-3 portable
computer and a patient monitor that doctors can wear in the
operating room, Golden said.
   NASA is at the show ``to make the U.S. engineering and
scientific community aware that there is NASA technology available
that they may use,'' said Walter Heiland, manager of the agency's
Technology Utilization Office.
   The space agency has a history of spinning off its technological
advances.
   For example, NASA's need in the 1960s for a tool that Apollo
astronauts could use to scoop up moon rocks, resulted in hand-held
cordless vacuum cleaners that eventually reached consumers. More
recently, a version of a pump developed for the Viking Mars lander
has been implanted in people to deliver medicine such as insulin.
   3M is showcasing a lightweight concrete subsitute called
Macrolite that weighs about a third as much as the real thing.
   To illustrate, 3M representatives filled a tub with water and
put in two ``concrete'' logs. One sinks. The other, made of the
substitute, floats.
   Developed by 3M in 1986, the lightweight concrete can be used
for building in earthquake-prone areas.
   ``You can build the same high-rise buildings, only much lighter,
so when they sway they don't topple over,'' said William Whitcomb,
a company representative.
   3M says the ceramic substance, pumped with air, is a better
insulator than concrete. An 8-inch wall of Macrolite provides the
insulating power of 65 inches of concrete, Whitcomb said.
   Dow Plastics, a division of Midland, Mich.-based Dow, is on hand
with a product it has no intention of producing _ a plastic,
elliptical lawnmower that cuts a swath about a foot wider than
traditional push mowers.
   Plastic allows a bigger machine that is no tougher to push than
steel and aluminum models, said mower designer Robert Cleereman.
   The idea is to show commercial engineers that plastics _
particularly Dow plastics _ can be used in place of metals and
woods, said Cleereman, who also is director of Dow's Materials
Engineering Center.
   ``Here's an example where plastics not only do it as well, they
do it better,'' he said.

   Sears Mortgage Corp. and the Federal National
Mortgage Association on Wednesday announced an agreement that will
provide financing for $2 billion in home mortgages.
   Under the agreement, Sears will originate over the next 12
months a variety of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages and
exchange them for mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae
or sell them to Fannie Mae for cash.
   Sears Mortgage, a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
originates home mortgages nationwide. Those to be delivered under
the deal will consist primarily of new loans, along with some
existing home loans.
   The partnership ``will provide thousands of Americans with
affordable home financing,'' said John R. Hayes, senior vice
president in charge of Fannie Mae's Midwestern regional office.
   ``This new supply of mortgage financing will enable Sears to
continue to make available to home buyers a wide variety of
mortgage loan products at competitive interest rates,'' said Walter
C. Kelin Jr., chairman and president of the Sears group.
   Fannie Mae is a congressionally chartered shareholder-owned
company and the nation's largest investor in home mortgages.

   A leading credit rating agency warned
Wednesay that Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. may have to sell more
assets to meet payments coming due in late 1992 on its $1.6 billion
debt.
   The warning from Moody's Investors Service Inc. came as Harcourt
reported that a big gain on the sale of its theme parks helped the
publishing and insurance concern earn $316.6 million in the fourth
quarter compared with a loss of $53.9 million during same period a
year ago.
   Moody's said that despite the sale of the theme parks and
subsequent repayment of bank debt, Harcourt's cash flow from its
publishing and insurance properties ``will provide only narrow
coverage of anticipated cash interest charges and capital
expenditures over the near term.''
   As a result, Moody's also lowered its ratings on Harcourt's debt.
   The ratings agency said that the requirement that Harcourt must
pay cash interest and dividends in late 1992 and 1993 ``is likely
to necessitate further asset sales and-or debt restructuring.''
   It downgraded Harcourt's senior debt rating to B3 from B1 and
ratings on other grades of debt were also reduced. The company's
debt had been assigned a speculative grade before the action and
the reductions indicate the agency feels chances for timely debt
repayment have grown riskier.
   The debt rating is one of the factors that are considered in
valuing a company's securities, and a ratings reduction often
causes a decline in the market price of a company's bonds.
   Two calls were placed to Harcourt for comment on Moody's action,
but they were not immediately returned.
   Harcourt amassed a huge debt nearly three years ago when it
underwent a massive restructuring in an effort to avoid a hostile
takeover by British publisher Robert Maxwell.
   In the fourth quarter, Harcourt said its earnings per share
amounted to $4.22 in contrast to a loss of $1.08 per share a year
earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue slipped 0.7 percent to $301.7 million
from $303.8 million a year earlier.
   The company closed the sale of its six theme parks to
Anheuser-Busch Cos. for $1.1 billion in the quarter. It reported a
gain on disposal of assets of $309 million in the quarter.
   It reported net income from continuing operations of $19.5
million for the quarter in contrast to a loss from continuing
operations of $54.7 million.
   For the year, Harcourt said it earned $72.1 million, or 17 cents
a share, in contrast to a loss of $53.4 million, or $2.03 a share,
a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 5.5 percent to $1.34 billion from
$1.27 billion a year earlier.
   The company said it recorded a charge of $176 million in the
third quarter, including a $95 million writeoff in its publishing
business.
   In explaining the debt ratings reduction, Moody's boted that
repayment of the company's bank debt with proceeds from the theme
parks sale had reduced Harcourt's interest costs substantially.
   It said the company should have enough cash flow to service its
cash interest charges and capital spending over the near term
because of the deferred cash payment features of some of its debt
instruments.
   But Moody's added, ``It is uncertain that the company will be
able to achieve the growth necessary to service its debt and
preferred stock once all fixed charges are payable in cash.''
   The agency noted that the market value of assets can change and
said the after-tax proceeds from sale of Harcourt assets ``at a
given point in time may not be sufficient to cover both debt and
preferred securities.''

   A Senate committee approved legislation
Wednesday aimed at providing greater protection of pension payments
when companies terminate retirement plans to capture their surplus
assets.
   The legislation by Sens. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., would impose new standards on pension fund
administrators in deciding whether to terminate retirement plans.
   ``This bill will stop employers from using their workers'
pension plans as corporate piggybanks,'' Metzenbaum said in a
statement after the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved the bill on a 11-5 vote.
   Kassebaum and Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., joined with the
panel's Democratic majority in voting to send the bill to the floor.
   Surplus pension assets have become a popular target for
corporate raiders who acquire a company and quickly end so-called
``defined benefit'' retirement programs to take any excess cash.
   ``Defined benefit'' programs are administered by trustees or the
employer and promise a certain benefit on retirement. So-called
``defined contribution'' plans where the company contributes to an
employee's account generally are not at issue, because the employe
owns the funds and there is no surplus cash _ when it comes time to
retire, the money is turned over the employee or buys an annuity.
   In general, the legislation would allow a company to strip out
surplus pension assets only if is determined to be in the best
interests of workers and retirees.
   The bill requires the company to consider specific issues in
making that determination, including whether cost-of-living
benefits would be provided to retirees and whether an adequate
financial cushion can be maintained in any replacement retirement
plan.
   Metzenbaum has maintained that at least a portion of surplus
pension assets should be set aside for cost-of-living adjustments
in retirement benefits. The legislation does not require COLAs, but
makes it more likely they would be provided, according to
supporters of the measure.
   The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. must approve pension fund
terminations. However, critics complain that existing law doesn't
adequately take into account whether pension beneficiaries will be
better or worse off if a corporation takes back excess money from
retirement plans.
   ``Workers who have been promised pensions should be assured
those promises will be fulfilled and that their interests will take
first place in these situations,'' Kassebaum said.
   Excess cash can arise in defined-benefit plans in several ways.
One common way is the upward revision of estimates of what plan
assets can earn. The higher the estimates, the less cash is needed
now to meet future obligations.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals board on Wednesday rejected
MCI's attempt to challenge part of the multi-billion-dollar
telephone contracts the government awarded to AT&amp;T and U.S. Sprint.
   At issue were changes to one of the two contracts to redesign
and provide a pair of voice, data and video telecommunications
networks in the 1990s for the government, a project that could
total $25 billion over 10 years.
   In December 1988, the General Services Administration awarded
the contract for one network to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
and the other to U.S. Sprint. Losing out was a third bidder, Martin
Marietta Corp., whose proposal included a substantial share for MCI
Telecommunications Corp.
   Wednesday's ruling by the GSA Board of Contract Appeals involved
a dispute over changes the GSA is permitting U.S. Sprint to make in
toll-free services.
   MCI had complained the modification was outside the scope of the
contract and that competition was necessary to satisfy the
requirement reflected in the changes.
   But the board, noting that the modification did not alter the
maximum value of the contract, rejected the appeal.
   ``The government is modernizing its telecommunications system to
incorporate technological advancements which permit greater
flexibility,'' the board said. ``The modifications represent
improvements to toll-free service.''
   MCI spokesman John Houser said the company would continue to
litigate changes to contracts it considers outside the scope of
contracts.
   ``We weren't totally surprised, but we're disappointed. We kind
of saw the writing on the wall on this one, but we thought we'd
make a point, which is that they should take a hard look at these,
so the interest of competition and the taxpayers is best served,''
Houser said.
   Last year, the board rejected an MCI challenge to the AT&amp;T award
and a federal appeals court later upheld the ruling. The FCC also
had rejected MCI charges that AT&amp;T set prices below costs in
bidding for the contract.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Board Decides Against Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW FRASER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp., the multinational
chemical company that analysts speculated had been contemplating
restructuring, announced Wednesday that it would not take that
route.
   ``Taking into account all the revelant factors ... we believe
that Carbide should at this time continue on its present course
under its present structure,'' Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said in a
statement.
   Analysts had speculated for some time that the company would
restructure to make it better able to fend off any takeover
attempt. The company plunged deeply in debt while fending off a
hostile takeover in 1986.
   Kennedy said Carbide had studied several restructuring
possibilities but nixed them because they were not beneficial to
the company or its shareholders.
   ``Our criteria have been enhancement of both shareholder value
and the strengthening of our core business,'' Kennedy said. ``At
this time there is no restructuring alternative that meets both
criteria.''
   Carbide stock, which soared last week amid rumors of a possible
takeover or spinoff, closed 50 cents higher Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange at $24.25.
   Union Carbide realigned in 1988, forming a holding corporation
with three subsidiaries. Analysts had speculated the move could
have been a prelude to spinning off one of subsidiaries to raise
capital.
   The three subsidiaries are Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics
Company Inc., Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc., and UCAR Carbon
Company Inc.
   David Kernis, a spokesman for Union Carbide, said the strategy
aimed to maximize development by decentralizing the company.
   Kennedy said the company plans to continue along that course but
would not rule out other options such as acquisitions, joint
ventures and strategic alliances.
   Kernis refused to say what restructuring options the company
considered. Kennedy could not be reached for comment Wednesday
night.
   Carbide earned $573 million last year, down 13 percent from
record profits of $662 million in 1988. Sales dipped to $8.32
billion last year from $8.74 billion in 1988.

   Stock in Digital Equipment Corp. soared by

might be the target of a takeover bid, but Digital officials
refused to comment on the stock activity.
   Bruce Watts, an analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc. in Boston, said
rumors circulated on Wall Street that Mitsubishi Electric Corp. had
acquired a large share of Digital stock, and there was speculation
it might try to take over the company.
   Digital stock closed up $6 at $78 on the New York Stock Exchange
Wednesday.
   Mitsubishi is one of the world's largest producers of
semiconductor memory devices, which are critical in computers.
   Nikki Richardson, a Digital spokeswoman, said: ``We don't talk

   The Walt Disney Co. scoured Hollywood on
Wednesday for the source of a bogus news release that claimed
moonwalking megastar Michael Jackson had signed a five-year movie
deal with Disney.
   Disney said it began an investigation to find the author of the
release, used as the basis for a story in a trade publication.
Among other things, the story said Jackson was negotiating to leave
CBS Records for Disney's new Hollywood Records and would design
theme park rides for Disney.
   ``We fully intend to take action against the person or persons
responsible,'' Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg said
in a news release. ``This company has a reputation for protecting
its name and taking legal action when necessary.''
   The bogus information was included in a front-page article
Wednesday in the Hollywood Reporter which focused on a stock deal
planned by Jackson's father. The paper ran a front-page article
Wednesday saying it had been the victim of a hoax.
   Editor Teri Ritzer said the writer who handled the story had
been disciplined. She declined to say whether he had been fired.
   Disney said the news release, typed on company stationery, was
sent to several publications. Spokesman Ed Pine said it appeared to
have been motivated by a personal vendetta against a Disney
employee and said the hoaxer hadn't been found, but refused to
discuss the matter further.
   Separately, Ed Shaw, a spokesman for the newly formed Jackson
Records set up by Michael Jackson's father Joe Jackson, said the
elder Jackson had held preliminary talks with several Wall Street
brokerages about a possible stock offering for as much as $100
million.
   Joe Jackson, who steered his children to stardom as the Jackson
Five but no longer handles the affairs of Michael or Janet Jackson,
wants to use the proceeds of the stock offering chiefly to fund
movies starring Michael and Janet, Shaw said.
   However, Michael Jackson's lawyer, John Branca, said neither he
nor his client knew anything about the planned offering.
   And Shaw acknowledged that neither Michael Jackson nor his
sister had agreed to make records or movies for Joe Jackson's
company.
   ``I don't think that any of the Wall Street firms would be
interested without the participation of the two megastars,'' he
said.
   The initial Hollywood Reporter story included a description of a
movie that Jackson supposedly would make with the troika of Steven
Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola. The outer-space
musical, tentatively titled ``Project M,'' was said to be budgeted
between $50 million and $60 million.
   Jackson stars in the 3-D movie ``Captain EO'' at Disneyland,
which opened in 1986 and was produced by Lucas, Coppola and Jackson.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. said it's ready to sell its $1
billion, still-unfinished technical center and then lease it back,
gaining $800 million in badly needed cash along the way.
   The move announced Tuesday is seen as a way for the financially
struggling No. 3 automaker to raise the money it needs to finance a
cost-cutting program that includes thousands of white-collar early
retirements.
   ``It looks to me like the smartest way to do it at the moment,''
said auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
   Chrysler on Monday filed papers with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington seeking permission to sell and lease back
its Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, about 25 miles
north of Detroit.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said Tuesday the company would
sell the center to the Auburn Hills Trust, which in turn would
offer certificates to raise $800 million for Chrysler.
   The trust then would lease the center to the Auburn Hills Trust
Services property management company, which would collect lease
payments from Chrysler to repay the $800 million by 2020.
   ``There are two basic advantages,'' Houston said. ``We can raise
more money than we could with a conventional mortgage and we get
$800 million for use by the company that's not tied up in the
center.''
   The money, he said, will go into Chrysler's general operating
coffers.
   The sale-lease arrangement is the latest in a series of moves
Chrysler has made to get rid of non-automotive businesses and raise
cash.
   Last September, Chrysler sold nearly half of its stake in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan and made about $310 million after
taxes. Earlier this month, it sold its Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.
subsidiary for $825 million.
   The company has been waging a cost-cutting program to chisel
about $1.5 billion from its $26 billion annual budget by the end of
the year.
   That program includes trimming more than 10 percent of the
white-collar work force through attrition or early retirement,
which costs money.
   Chrysler reported that it lost $664 million in the fourth
quarter of 1989, including $577 million in write-offs for two car
assembly plants the company is closing this year. It was the
automaker's first quarterly loss since 1982.
   Chrysler and state government officials broke ground for the
2.5-million-square-foot complex in October 1986. It originally was
targeted to be completed this year and house 5,000 employees.
   Houston said the completion date now is 1993 and the center will
house 7,000 workers, most of whom now work at the company's
Highland Park headquarters.

<TEXT>
   Seabrook nuclear power plant proponents
and opponents rarely agree, but both say the regulatory process
leading up to Thursday's expected licensing of the plant _ 14 years
after groundbreaking _ has been ridiculous.
   Both sides expect the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license
the $6.5 billion plant owned by a dozen utilities, but opponents
promised legal action to keep it idle.
   ``I never thought it would take this long,'' said former Gov.
Meldrim Thomson, a Seabrook supporter who served during 1973-79.
   ``If any human being could dream up anything worse, they would
have to work at it,'' Thomson said. ``We've been told over and over
again that we've built the best and safest plant that's ever been
built. It's ridiculous that it hasn't been licensed.''
   Veteran anti-Seabrook protester Paul Gunter, first arrested at
the plant in 1976, is equally critical, but from the opposite
viewpoint.
   ``The regulatory process has been in the hands of a promotional
agency rather than a regulatory agency,'' he said. ``(The NRC) has
basically pulled Seabrook into operation even though it can't meet
the law and protect human safety.''
   Dianne Dunfey, another veteran protester, was released from jail
last week after serving a five-day term for refusing to pay a fine
following a sit-in at Gov. Judd Gregg's office. She called the NRC
``one of the most disreputable of all government agencies.''
   ``It has ignored public input,'' said Dunfey, who teaches in
Seabrook. ``It either discarded or amended all of its own
regulations anytime Seabrook couldn't meet one.''
   Asked why the licensing procedure had taken as long as it did,
NRC spokesman John Kopeck in Washington, said, ``There was a legal
process that it had to go through _ there were a lot of steps that
had to be taken ...''
   If promised court appeals don't succeed, Seabrook would go
through a three-month buildup to full-power operation.
   The main point in the way of licensing was the federal
requirement for evacuation plans for communities within 10 miles of
the plant, including six in Massachusetts.
   Opponents say the area surrounding the plant _ about two miles
from popular Hampton Beach and 40 miles north of Boston _ is too
densely populated to be evacuated safely in an emergency.
   ``The regulatory process at the NRC is largely a charade,'' Sen.
Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
``They have brushed aside concerns about evacuation. Anybody who's
been in a traffic jam (near the plant) during the summer knows that
in a panic situation, evacuation would be impossible.''
   Seabrook proponents, including former Gov. John Sununu, now
White House chief of staff, say the plans will work. Sununu
declined to comment on the plant this week, but as governor he was
a vocal supporter.
   ``It may be a surprise ... but we run the analogy of an
(evacuation) experiment 7:30 each summer day,'' Sununu said during
a 1983 debate. ``At 7:30 that beach is crowded ... and at 11 at
night that beach is empty.''
   While environmental groups and the Massachusetts attorney
general fought the evacuation plans, the grassroots Clamshell
Alliance staged anti-Seabrook demonstrations that made the plant a
national focus of the anti-nuclear movement in the 1970s and '80s.
   The last major Seabrook demonstration was in October, when 475
people were arrested after scaling the fences.
   A few opponents began vigils Tuesday at the Statehouse and
outside Seabrook. A larger demonstration was to follow the
licensing vote.
   Seabrook's path toward licensing has been a rocky one.
Seabrook's lead owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, filed
for a permit to build twin, 1,150-megawatt reactors in 1973. The
first was to operate commercially in 1979, the second in 1981.
Total cost was estimated at $973 million.
   The NRC approved the permit in 1976, but it was suspended three
times in the late 1970s in disputes over radioactive waste and
tunnels for cooling water.
   The first reactor was finished in the mid-1986 at a cost of $4.3
billion; the second, 25 percent complete, was scrapped that year.
Since then, financing and operating costs have boosted the cost by
$50 million a month, bringing the total by Thursday to $6.5 billion.
   Public Service filed for bankruptcy in January 1988 under the
burden of its Seabrook debt.

<HEAD>Parent of Seized Thrift Files Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former parent of Imperial Savings
Association sought bankruptcy protection just days after the thrift
was seized by federal regulators, who said it was $60.1 million in
the red.
   The government took control of Imperial Savings last week in
large part because of problems brought about by its large portfolio
of junk bonds.
   Imperial had invested more than $9.7 billion of its assets in
junk bonds. Junk bond prices have plummetted in recent months and
thrifts must divest their holdings by 1994 under provisions of last
year's savings and loan bailout legislation.
   Only Columbia Savings and Loan in Beverly Hills has a bigger
portfolio of the high-yield, high-risk bonds among thrifts.
   Imperial's former parent, Imperial Corp. of America, said
Wednesday it had filed for Chapter 11 protection in bankruptcy
court in San Diego to protect its other subsidiaries.
   The filing will give it breathing room to come up with a
reorganization plan without having to worry about creditors'
lawsuits.
   ``This was a very difficult decision,'' said ICA Chief Executive
Lyman Hamilton. ``However, in an effort to protect our bondholders,
shareholders and continue our operating businesses, we believe this
was a prudent thing to do.''
   Imperial Corp. and its former savings and loan subsidiary
effectively split Friday when the thrift was taken over by the
Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency that manages seized
thrifts. Accounts up to $100,000 are federally insured.
   ``Today's filing by Imperial Corp. in now way affects Imperial
Savings or its depositors' savings ... because the two are now
independent companies,'' Imperial Savings spokesman Kenn Ulrich
said.
   Imperial Corp. will be forwarding documentation of its assets
and liabilities to the court over the next few weeks, said Patrick
Shea, a lawyer for the firm representing the corporation in the
proceedings.
   Ulrich said he didn't know what Imperial Corp.'s other
subsidiaries were and didn't have any of its financial data
available because he started his job just two weeks ago.

<HEAD>Union Files Class-Action Suit Against Nordstrom Over Wages, Hours</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing workers at Nordstrom Inc.
filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday, accusing the clothing
retailer of widespread violations of wage and hour laws.
   The suit was the second to be filed against the upscale clothier
in as many days.
   On Tuesday, a U.S. District Court suit was filed here by three
Nordstrom shareholders who alleged they and other stockholders had
suffered financial losses because company officials failed to
disclose labor problems at the chain.
   United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Locals 1001 and 367 and
five current and former Nordstrom employees filed their suit in
King County Superior Court. The suit includes in its class
approximately 50,000 current and former Nordstrom workers in
Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, Utah and Alaska.
   The two locals represent about 1,500 Nordstrom workers in the
Seattle area. Nationally, Nordstrom has about 60 stores and employs
about 30,000.
   On Feb. 15, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries
ruled Nordstrom had violated state laws by failing to pay some
employees for time worked outside normal working hours.
   The state, acting on a complaint filed by the UFCW, found that
workers had not been properly compensated for such things as
attending meetings, delivering merchandise to other stores and
customers, doing inventory work or writing thank-you notes to
customers.
   Nordstrom said Monday it had made a $15 million provision for
expected back pay claims by employees and adopted a procedure to
handle the claims. The charge against fourth-quarter earnings was
cited by the company as one reason why profits fell 34 percent in
the period ending Jan. 31.
   Joe Peterson, Local 1001 president in Seattle, said at the time
that the $15 million was far too little and threatened to sue if
Nordstrom officials failed to negotiate a back-pay settlement with
the union. Union officials have said claims could exceed $200
million in California alone.
   Nordstrom said claims forms had been sent to sales clerks in
states other than Washington. In Washington state, those forms must
be reviewed by the state's labor office and by the two union locals.
   Labor and Industries spokeswoman Karen Jones said Wednesday that
the review had not yet taken place, and James Webster, attorney for
Local 1001, said, ``They have not come to us to discuss that plan
as they said they would in the papers.''
   Webster said the union had ``hoped for a settlement from the
outset,'' and was still willing to meet with company officials.
   The union lawsuit repeats the allegations made in the state
complaint and alleges other violations of Washington and California
labor laws, including that Washington employees were required to
buy clothes from Nordstrom to wear at work.
   In a news release, Nordstrom co-chairman John Nordstrom said the
company regretted the lawsuit, saying that once it was filed,
``local court rules place restrictions on our ability to
communicate directly with our employees about their claims. This
could slow down and perhaps bring to a halt the resolution
process.''
   Nordstrom said the company will continue trying to compensate
for back claims, including seeking court approval to do so.
   The suit asks the court to order Nordstrom to keep proper
employment records and award damages equal to twice the amount of
wages unpaid, other damages to be determined at trial, and
attorneys' fees.
   The union has said claims in Washington state may total $30
million to $40 million and run as high as $200 million in
California. It had no estimate on likely claims in other states.
   To date, the union has received about 520 claims from workers
worth about $2.5 million.
