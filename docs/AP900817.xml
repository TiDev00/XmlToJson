   The speaker of Iraq's parliament said Friday that Iraq will hold
all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' _ presumably including
3,000 Americans _ until the threat of war against his country ends.
He said they would be housed throughout the country in military and
civilian installations.
   The White House refused comment Friday night on Baghdad's
announcement.
   ``We don't have a reaction,'' said Doug Davidson, an assistant
White House press secretary. ``We may well have one in the
morning.''
   The United States sent some of its most sophisticated offensive
weapons to the region as the Persian Gulf crisis entered its third
week.
   Included too were up to 38 commercial airliners, which the
Pentagon said Friday night were being turned over to the military
to help haul troops and cargo overseas. Such a move by 16 airlines
was the first time the U.S. civilian air fleet has been diverted to
a military use.
   The moves continue in the aftermath of Iraq's lightning invasion
of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which precipitated the crisis and also trapped
at least 4,000 British citizens.
   ``The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens
of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with
an aggressive war,'' speaker Sadi Mahdi said late Friday in a
statement carried by the official Iraqi news agency.
   Mahdi's announcement, monitored in Nicosia, came after a meeting
of Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council, presided over by President
Saddam Hussein.
   Mahdi said arrangements were being made for housing the
foreigners with the ministries of oil and military installations,
the armed forces and other ministries. Military and oil-related
installations would be potential targets in an armed conflict.
   The speaker urged all American and allied forces to withdraw
from the region and attacked mandatory economic sanctions on Iraq
voted by the United Nations, saying, ``These governments are . . .
going out of their way to starve the Iraqi people in an
unprecedentedly brutal fashion.''
   Iraq, which imports about three-quarters of its food but is
being impacted by an international blockade in the region, holds an
estimated 14,000 Westerners besides the Americans and Britons.
   Americans and other foreigners who feared being rounded up in
Kuwait disguised themselves as Arabs, drove through the Kuwaiti
desert in a convoy of 13 cars and reached Saudi Arabia on Friday.
   ``As soon as we left the paved road, we ran into Iraqis and they
said we had to go back,'' said Stephanie McGehee, 37, one of at
least three Americans in the group. ``We moved away and then took
another turn through the desert sands and made a dash for it.''
   ``It was very, very terrifying.''
   McGehee, an Associated Press photographer and part-time
correspondent from Leucadia, Calif., reported by telephone from the
Khafji border post that the entire convoy was safe and sound. It
was not clear how many escaped, though her car carried nine,
including a Canadian friend, one Briton and four Indians.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council expressed concern over
the fate of the detained foreigners and asked the secretary-general
to take all necessary steps to help them.
   At the same time, a special Security Council committee met to
discuss compliance with the international embargo intended to force
Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the Saudi border.
   If the panel decides the boycott is not being honored, the
Security Council can declare a military blockade and urge member
states to enforce it.
   That would be an important development for the United States,
which did not seek U.N. approval before ordering its ships in the
Middle East to intercept vessels carrying goods to or from Iraq or
Kuwait.
   The Pentagon said Navy commanders stopped two Iraqi vessels in
the Persian Gulf on Friday, but let them proceed after determining
they carried no goods.
   Washington recently decided to strengthen its forces by adding
Stealth fighter-bombers and amphibious assault ships, among other
offensive weapons. And on Friday President Bush decided to call up
some military reserve units, administration officials in Washington
said.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Friday the
Soviet Union would send troops to the Persian Gulf if the United
Nations calls for a multinational military force to solve the
crisis.
   Japan also was considering joining the forces defending Saudi
Arabia against a possible Iraqi attack. It may break with its
long-held policy against deployment of military equipment overseas,
perhaps by sending minesweepers.
   Concern about the U.S. citizens detained in occupied Kuwait and
Iraq grew Friday after about three dozen Americans in the Rashid
Hotel in Baghdad were reportedly moved to an undisclosed location.
   Bush protested attempts to move Americans ``against their will.''
   U.S. officials in the Iraqi capital demanded access to the
detainees, who were taken to Iraq from Kuwait after Iraq invaded
the emirate to increase its share of world oil reserves to 20
percent.
   The Iraqi invasion stranded more than 2 million foreigners,
including more than 450 Japanese.
   About 6,500 foreigners fled to Jordan from Iraq and Kuwait on
Friday.
   Bush, asked what would happen if the Americans in Kuwait were
taken to Iraq, said: ``I don't think anybody ought to be moved
against their will in contravention of international law.''
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., on a stop in Israel, went further,
saying Iraq would face American military retaliation if Americans
were harmed.
   In other crisis-related developments Friday:
   _Iraq freed 1,000 prisoners of its 1980-88 war with Iran and
started pulling Iraqi troops back from the Iranian border, part of
its campaign to focus on the escalating confrontation with the
United States. It has about 300,000 troops facing Iran and could
send some to Kuwait and the Saudi border.
   _Prices fell broadly on the New York Stock Exchange, echoing
losses overseas amid continued concern about the Mideast. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 36.64 to 2,644.80, and
at one point was down by as much as 65 points.
   _Lebanon's most influential Shiite Moslem cleric, Sheik Mohammed
Hussein Fadlallah, called for a pan-Islamic confrontation of U.S.
military forces in the gulf. ``America has declared war on Islam. .
. . So let us . . . confront the immense challenge that threatens
us all,'' said Fadlallah, spiritual guide of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, Iran's main ally in Lebanon.

   The three young cops did a double-take when they
spotted the city's most-arrested burglar sitting in the back room
of Chicago Joe's, but there was nothing to worry about.
   Joseph ``Pops'' Panczko, a 12-time loser with more than 150
arrests under his belt, was in good hands. The plainclothes
detectives and the FBI agent were chipping in for his shrimp
dinner, and the advertising executive was plying him with shots and
beer.
   It was the monthly meeting of the Merry Gangsters, and Panczko,
a frequent guest of the state, was the guest of honor.
   Despite their fearsome name, the Gangsters are just a group of
otherwise reputable citizens who take pride in Chicago's sordid
past.
   ``We just sit around and talk,'' said retired adman Billy
Reilly, who founded the group with friends Richard Lindberg and
Nathan Kaplan a year and a half ago.
   Much of the talk is about mobsters and madams, but honor is also
paid to corrupt cops and greedy politicians.
   ``You can never get tired of this city. It's got real people in
it _ real characters,'' said Kaplan, 69, a free-lance writer and
retired salesman. ``I go to other cities and watch the news. I see
their city councils. They've got straight bellies and good posture.
They use good diction. I don't feel like I'm with real people.''
   By Kaplan's definition, Panczko, 72, is a real person, complete
with potbelly.
   Despite his 50-plus years as a professional criminal, he was
greeted affectionately Tuesday night by the Gangster regulars,
including Burt Neilson and Jim Brindisi _ both retired detectives.
Panczko also got a special hello from a newcomer, FBI agent Bill
Clancy.
   ``I've heard a lot about you, Pops, but don't worry, I'm a
specialist in white-collar crime,'' Clancy said.
   There's nothing white collar about Panczko, who got his nickname
from the only legitimate job he ever tried _ driving a soft-drink
truck.
   ``I hated them calling me, `Hey, pop man,' so I went back to
stealing,'' he said.
   ``I started stealing chickens when I was 11 and got my first
pinch for swiping some of those dago cheeses you grind up and put
on spaghetti,'' said Panczko. ``If it wasn't wired down, I stole it
_ or maybe my brothers did. One time I took the milkman's whole
wagon _ horse, too. And my brother Butch stole a cement mixer once.
Somebody watched him and got him pinched _ him and the junkyard guy
he sold it to.''
   Panczko said he once paid a policeman a $1,000 bribe to overlook
the heist of a load of socks from the trunk of a salesman's car,
and then got only $20 for the socks.
   ``Damn cops, that's where all my money went,'' he complained.
   Gangster member Lindberg, the official historian of the Chicago
White Sox, smiled.
   ``Dick's writing a true history of the Chicago police,'' said
Reilly. ``He'll probably be arrested.''
   Gangster member Harold Rubin of Cicero does some filching, too,
but he does his legally _ moving in on former mob-owned buildings
one step ahead of the wreckers.
   A dealer in Al Capone memorabilia, Rubin isn't content with the
small trophies like guns, autographs and Capone's barber's straight
razor. He wants the impressive, stuff, too.
   ``I just went into the old 4811 Club in Cicero _ the old
gambling dive _ and I got some great items,'' he said. ``I got the
26 table. That's the dice game you played against the young ladies
with the big busts; you wouldn't know if you won or lost. I also
got the cell door.''
   Cell door?
   ``Yeah, they had this jail cell in the basement for guys who
couldn't pay their tabs,'' he said. ``I pulled the door out of a
couple of feet of water.''
   Rubin said one of his coups was removing the interior marble
from the Lexington Hotel, a one-time Capone headquarters.
   Kenan Heise, a Chicago Tribune obituary editor and historian,
spoke of another Capone-owned hotel, the Metropole.
   ``It was a beautiful place in its day, and when my first book
came out in 1971, I gave the publication party there,'' he
remembered. ``It was a whorehouse by then, though, and I had a
little trouble explaining what kind of party I wanted.''

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait wasn't 24
hours old when the Senate interrupted its business to deplore it
and denounce him. But what was that echo in the chamber?
   Why did a senator or two refer _ in a looking-over-his-shoulder
way _ to the ``Gulf of Tonkin Resolution''?
   Why did minds turn back to an August debate 26 years ago? In
that debate, the Senate, over the misgivings of only two senators,
reacted to reports that U.S. Navy vessels had been attacked off
North Vietnam's coast by authorizing President Lyndon Johnson ``to
prevent further aggression.''
   LBJ used that resolution as the equivalent of a declaration of
war, the basis on which he sent 250,000 American soldiers to fight
an Asian war, America's longest war, the first it lost.
   Almost by stealth, America was sucked into a guerrilla war on
the side of an unpopular government. Johnson hoped each escalation
would be enough _ only to find that each, instead, made withdrawal
more difficult.
   And Vietnam deteriorated into a quagmire, an inextricable
situation. The United States couldn't win and couldn't quit.
   Is the gulf crisis another quagmire in the making, another place
where U.S. forces can't win and can't get out, stuck in 100 degree
heat, unable to do more than wait to react to Saddam Hussein? Does
history offer some guidance here?
   For the most part, historians familiar with the region and with
the ways war develop are more optimistic than that. They find some
similarities to Vietnam. But they draw encouragement from some big
differences.
   ``Not the least of which,'' said John Gaddis, diplomatic
historian at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, ``is that this thing
really is a multinational effort that grows out of a rather
shocking provocation _ and neither was true in Vietnam.''
   Bernard Lewis, a retired Princeton University historian and
author of 20 books on the Islamic world, said Saddam Hussein made a
crucial miscalculation last weekend. He sought to turn his invasion
of Iraq into a religious crusade; instead, said Lewis, he only
``succeeded in isolating himself even in the Arab world.''
   If his maneuver had worked, Saddam might have made his battle
into an Arab-against-the-West struggle. Instead, he made it
the-world-against-Iraq, Lewis said.
   Saddam called for a jihad, a religious war, for the Arab masses
to rise up against their leaders. And he did it just as the leaders
were assembled in a summit at Cairo.
   ``They were hesitating when he produced this call to jihad,''
said Lewis. ``This was a direct challenge. It was an act of
desperation.''
   In response, the leaders of Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the
other oil states of the Persian Gulf, in an extraordinary rebuff to
a fellow Arab, decided to send a military force to protect Saudi
Arabia from Saddam.
   In Vietnam, by contrast, America's allies, even in Asia, largely
limited their support to the sidelines. Only Australia, New
Zealand, Thailand and Korea sent sizeable combat contingents.
   Political scientist Nathan Brown, a Mideast specialist at George
Washington University, said quagmire in the Persian Gulf may be
``the best we can hope for,'' considering the alternatives _ a
humiliating U.S. withdrawal or a military offensive against the
Iraqis in Kuwait, requiring a scale of warfare ``that is
politically impossible.''
   Brown questions whether the Bush administration thought through
its options.
   Even if Iraq gains enough control in the region to restrict
petroleum output and boost the price, ``I'm not sure the
repercussions are serious enough to say our national security is at
stake,'' Brown said.
   ``The worst that people are talking about is a recession,''
Brown said. ``We've lived through recessions before. That doesn't
really affect our national security.''
   Brown recalls the Suez Crisis of 1956 when Britain, in a break
with the United States, decided it simply could not permit the
canal to fall into Egypt's hands. But that's what happened. Eleven
years later, in the 1967 Arab-Israel war, the canal was closed for
seven years _ ``and nobody noticed.''
   But Lewis views the threat of Saddam controlling the oilfields
of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia as graver than that.
   ``You simply can't allow this man to obtain a stranglehold on
the world's supplies,'' he said.
   George Herring, a University of Kentucky historian of the
Vietnam war, said he sees in the Persian Gulf one big similarity to
Vietnam and one big difference.
   The difference, he said, is that the American commitment to
Vietnam was slow and as concealed as Lyndon Johnson could manage.
It grew from a few hundred U.S. troops sent to advise the French in
the 1950s to more than 200,000 troops, engaged in full-fledged
combat in July 1965.
   In contrast, the Persian Gulf operations has been ``sudden and
dramatically large,'' Herring said. Where Johnson sought to
underplay the buildup, President Bush broadcasts his determination
to commit whatever force it takes to pry Iraq out of Kuwait.
   The similarity, Herring said, is in ``the nature of the beast
you are dealing with. All the Vietnam policymakers have admitted in
the last 10 or 15 years that the crucial mistake they made was
underestimating the enemy and the enemy's willingness to make huge
sacrifices.''
   ``If they miss that this time, we're in bad shape,'' Herring
said. ``They should have seen it in the Iran-Iraq war. They missed
it in the French war against the Vietnamese.''
   Gaddis said the proper analogy is Korea, not Vietnam. Then, as
now, he said, there was a swift cross-border invasion. Then as now,
it was met by a multinational, U.N.-backed, response.
   Korea became an American quagmire, too, but Gaddis sees a
crucially different factor at play this time.
   ``Korea proved difficult to get out of but what kept us there
was Chinese intervention in November 1950,'' he said. ``What's
interesting this time is that this is the first crisis where the
great powers have all been in agreement. Saddam Hussein doesn't
have that ability to play the superpowers against each other. It's
been a most remarkable thing, the unanimity that Bush has been able
to rally behind him.''
   Kenneth Oye of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an expert
on economic warfare, also finds remarkable the degree of compliance
Bush has commanded so far in his call for an international embargo
against Iraq.
   But he questions the staying power of nations for whom sanctions
against Iraq _ and life without oil from Iraq and Kuwait _ will be
painful.
   ``If Saddam Hussein makes no big moves, doesn't use poison gas,
doesn't go into Jordan, doesn't stage air raids on the Turkish
border, if he just sits tight, I suspect that international support
for sanctions will lose ground,'' Oye says. ``And if they are not
universally supported they lose their effectiveness.''
   He notes how President Jimmy Carter's grain embargo to punish
the Soviet Union for its Afghanistan invasion became so unpopular
with farmers that Ronald Reagan used it as an issue in his campaign
against Carter.
   Lewis concurs that patience is the key. He says Saddam clearly
hopes the American people and business, with their famously short
attention span, ultimately will pressure Bush to bring the boys
home _ just as public opinion ultimately forced the United States
to find a face-saving formula for leaving Vietnam with the war
unwon.
   But this time he thinks it won't work. ``My guess is that the
Iraqis will break under the pressure of sanctions before American
patience wears out. But that's the key question.''
   Bush compares Saddam not to Ho Chi Minh, the ideologically
driven strategist who commanded communist forces in Vietnam, but to
Adolf Hitler, a dictator who invaded his neighbors to enlarge his
fascist Reich.
   Historians Lewis and Gaddis find the comparison apt.
   ``I think what happened (in Kuwait) is very much the decision of
one irrational leader and not some new trend in world politics,''
said Gaddis. ``It is almost a reversion to the way leaders used to
act in the 1930s.''
   Said Lewis: ``If one can invade another country and get away
with it, we're back in the 1930s, we're back in the international
jungles. Then the world will belong to the violent and the
ruthless.''

   Stay out of the music scene for four years
and look what happens.
   British soul stylist Paul Young can tell you all about it. After
his third album, ``Between Two Fires,'' ran its course in 1986, he
slowed down to start a family. He then took two more years to put
together his latest album, ``Other Voices.''
   While he was gone, the Motown sound returned to the charts with
blue-eyed soul singers and fellow Brits at the helm: George
Michael, Simply Red and Lisa Stansfield. Young returned just in
time.
   ``People could say I've been away long enough to be forgotten,''
he said in an interview. ``In some territories, it is long enough
to be forgotten, but in other territories, it's been a break, and
that's not such a bad thing.''
   Young began ``Other Voices'' with the same staff he had used on
his three previous albums, but was unsatisfied with the results.
Six months' work, as he said, went ``down the pan.''
   So he started anew. He brought in plenty of guest musicians _
Pink Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar, singer Chaka Khan on backing
vocals and Stevie Wonder on harmonica. Nile Rodgers produced a
track, and two more were done with former J. Geils Band leader
Peter Wolf.
   But Young still felt he had to get back to his roots in Britain
and did some recording there as well.
   ``Working with Peter, I was coming up with music that was very
different from what I'd done before, much more American,'' he said.
``My biggest audience is in Europe and I can't ignore that.''
   ``Other Voices'' is filled with material by other artists,
including covers of the Chi-Lites' ``Oh Girl'' and Free's ``A
Little Bit of Love.'' Young sees doing these songs as a way of
distancing himself from his own material.
   ``I'd like to forget that I wrote them and approach them as an
arranger and then I could probably enjoy it more,'' he said. ``But
underneath it, there's always my song and so I see it one
particular way. That somehow stops me from doing certain things.
   ``With other songs, I've heard them one way, I see them another
way, so straightaway, I've got this choice of things I can do with
it and I think that makes it more enjoyable.''
   He also sees doing covers as a way to keep great old songs
alive, but likes to look for the less well-known standards.
   ``I tend to prefer finding songs that are little gems in the
dust, as it were, and making them out to be something special,
because maybe they (the audience) missed it the first time
'round,'' he said.
   ``I don't like a lot of music that loses track of its roots. I
hope that what I'm doing when I do these things is keeping the old
stuff in their minds, but keeping up to date in terms of how I work
the arrangements, what instruments I use, stuff like that.''
   On ``Other Voices,'' Young said he went back to ``playing a lot
of stuff live again and not using too much machinery. I think the
trick is to use the machinery but still make it sound very human.''
   Songwriting is not his forte, he said, but he's looking to
change that.
   ``I think I was working with a guy who also found it very hard
to be a songwriter and that made it even more difficult,'' he said.
``So now I've made some contacts with people who actually enjoy the
process of being stuck in a room for eight hours, which I don't
find in the least bit inviting.''
   Young's solo career began in 1982 after 3{ years with the soul
outfit the Q-Tips. His first break came in 1983 with a version of
the Marvin Gaye classic, ``Wherever I Lay My Hat,'' which stayed at
No. 1 in England for three weeks. His debut album, ``No Parlez,''
also reached the top of the charts there.
   His long-awaited U.S. success came with the Top 20 song, ``Come
Back and Stay,'' also from ``No Parlez.'' But his second album,
``The Secret of Association,'' released in 1985, contained his
first U.S. No. 1 hit _ ``Everytime You Go Away,'' written by Daryl
Hall of Hall and Oates.
   He doesn't necessarily see ``Other Voices'' as a progression,
but rather a beginning of new things.
   ``I think I've now built myself another little base to work
from,'' he said. ``It's a pretty good mixture of what the last
three albums had done and it's now on one album. There's quite a
few indications of ways I could go.''

<DATELINE>TVER, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citizens of Tver and dozens of other
Soviet cities are casting off the names and symbols of a painful
past.
   The people of this ancient city 100 miles northwest of Moscow
started by taking back the name it bore for centuries before Stalin
called it Kalinin, for a henchman born near Tver.
   To Catherine the Great, the city was ``the most beautiful in the
empire'' after St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, because of its 18th
century architecture. As the namesake of Mikhail Kalinin, it became
a reminder of repression and death.
   Gorky Street in Moscow, the capital's main thoroughfare, has
been changed back to Tverskaya Street. Fashionable shops and stores
lined the street before the Bolshevik revolution, and outside the
city it became the main road to Tver.
   On July 19, the front page of Kalininskaya Pravda, the local
newspaper, carried a decree signed by Boris N. Yeltsin, president
of the Russian republic. It said the republic's Presidium
``decrees: Rename the city Kalinin to the city Tver.''
   Yeltsin had reversed half a century and fulfilled a dream of
many residents.
   A poem published with the decree said: ``Well, goodbye Kalinin.
You were just a pseudonym of our returning Tver.''
   Now, even the newspaper will have to call itself something else.
   The name game is sweeping this vast country. For decades,
cities, streets, ships, farms and factories were renamed for
Bolshevik heroes and officials.
   Then, as political times changed under Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
history was rewritten, some of the officials were disgraced and the
circle was completed.
   Naberezhni Chelny, renamed Brezhnev, was returned to its
original name. Tsaritsyn, renamed Stalingrad, became Volgograd.
   Other name changes actual or likely include the emergence of old
Samara from Kuibyshev, Nizhny Novgorod from Gorky; transformation
of Kirov to Vzyatka, Sverdlovsk to old Ekaterinburg, Andropov to
Rybinsk; the rescue of Marnupol from Zhdanov, Lugansk from
Voroshilovgrad and Vladikavkaz from Ordzhonikidze.
   Some people who are fed up with the old order even want to
change Leningrad back to St. Petersburg.
   The name of Mikhail Kalinin, the Soviet president in 1938-1946,
was attached to many places other than Tver, which became Kalinin
on his birthday in 1931.
   Koenigsberg, a historic German city incorporated into the Soviet
Union at the end of World War II, became Kaliningrad. Major streets
in other Soviet cities, including Moscow, honor Kalinin.
   He was a figurehead president hated by victims of the
collectivization of agriculture, a dark period in the country's
history.
   Millions of people were arrested and executed as ``enemies of
the people''' during the collectivization of the 1930s, including
many from Kalinin's home region. Some of the bodies are believed to
have been dumped into mass, unmarked graves near Tver.
   The campaign to regain Kalinin's old name began in the 1960s,
but did not get far until Gorbachev and glasnost came along. Eleven
engineers and intellectuals founded a group called Return in March
1988 with that as its goal.
   Boris Yershov, a leader of the group and a local legislator,
said Return's members were described at first as ``extremists,
sometimes as hooligans.''
   People asked, ```How could you insult the memory of Mikhail
Kalinin, a leading figure in the party, government and society?'''
Yershov said.
   ``When we said he wasn't a leading figure of the party and the
government, people just didn't believe us. People were so fooled by
the propaganda ... for years, for decades, about our leaders, they
just didn't accept our words.''
   Support for Return gradually increased, Yershov said, and people
began asking: ``If Kalinin is not the person he's made out to be,
why do we bear his name? Why such a supreme honor to a person who
promoted Stalin's crimes?''
   More than 14,000 of the city's 475,000 people signed a petition
last year demanding it be called Tver again. Local party and
legislative bodies eventually gave their support and the idea was
ratified by Yeltsin, a radical reformer elected president of
Russia, the country's largest republic, in June.
   Residents interviewed the day Yeltsin's decree was published
said the move was welcome but they also wanted other changes.
   ``I'm not in a festive mood,'' said Natalya Drozdenko, a woman
in her mid-30s waiting in a long line to buy chickens.
   ``It's only right to change the name and we have been struggling
for it, lending our signatures to petitions, etcetera, but somehow
I understand it's only symbolic and it won't affect our
well-being.''
   Alexander Bartyenyev, an 84-year-old World War II veteran
strolling past the shops, remembers when the city was still called
Tver and said Mikhail Kalinin never deserved the honor.
   ``Kalinin was treated as one of our own,'' Bartyenyev said. ``He
was born here and worked here, but as president of the country, he
could not stop the blood-letting.''
   Yershov said his organization now would turn its attention to
restoring monuments, churches and the old street names.

<HEAD>Dutch Enlist ``Fingerprinting'' Method to Spot Iraqi Oil</HEAD>

   Dutch customs officials have
enlisted a chemical ``fingerprinting'' method to spot any Iraqi or
Kuwaiti oil smuggled into Rotterdam, Europe's largest oil port, in
violation of sanctions.
   The method relies on a process known as gas chromatography and
is already used by oil companies and by a government agency trying
to identify sources of North Sea oil pollution, customs service
spokesman Cornelis Verlaan said Thursday.
   Verlaan told The Associated Press the customs laboratory in
Amsterdam now plans to use the technique to check samples of crude
oil shipments arriving in Rotterdam.
   In line with the Aug. 6 U.N. embargo, the Netherlands has banned
all Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil imports and transshipments through
Rotterdam, Europe's largest refining center and site of a huge oil
spot market. The U.N. action was to punish Iraqi for its miitary
takeover of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Verlaan said it takes five to six weeks for an oil tanker to
reach Rotterdam, so ``no oil loaded after Aug. 7 has arrived here
yet.''
   The identification process is based on differences in texture
and chemical composition found in every oil field's deposits.
   Verlaan said samples taken in Rotterdam will be compared with a
file of about 40 crude samples, including those from Iraq and
Kuwait.
   ``You kind of take a fingerprint,'' said Verlaan. ``If we're in
a real hurry, we can conduct an analysis in 24 hours.''
   He said the procedure is now about 80 percent accurate, adding,
``We're refining the technique all the time.''
   Verlaan conceded that crude oil could be tampered with on its
way to Rotterdam, but said ``you would see an entirely different
picture than with oil that hasn't been doctored.''
   Oil companies are using the process to check on the origin of
their crude.
   The Traffic and Waterways Ministry has been using the gas
chromatography technique to trace ships suspected of causing North
Sea oil spills, Verlaan said.

<TEXT>
   Following is the text of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's open letter to President Bush, broadcast by the
Iraqi media in Arabic and translated by The Associated Press:
   ``In the name of God, the almighty, the compassionate,
   ``An open letter to the President of the United States:
   ``I have become aware of your latest statements and heated
comments before the staff of the American defense ministry that
reflected your intention in pursuing a policy harmful to Iraq, a
policy of occupation that humiliates the sacred shrine and lands of
the Arabs and Moslems in Hijaz and Najd.
   ``I will not hesitate, Mr. President, to tell you that while I
read your words that reflected clearly your mockery and disregard
for the Arab mentality and national and official Arab sentiment,
your shallowness became so apparent. I had thought you were more
farsighted than that. And I cannot but admit that my conviction in
the just policy chosen by the Iraqi people, which I serve and lead,
has increased, and so has increased my conviction in the
righteousness of every patriotic Arab and Moslem who supports the
path of holy war against the invading forces.
   ``You have tried, you, as a President of a superpower, along
with your small agents, to brand Saddam Hussein a liar after
failing to stab him in other ways. You, all, whose files are
thickest in this respect.
   ``You and your business partners in the region and your agents
have said that Saddam Hussein promised (Egyptian President) Hosni
Mubarak that he would not do this or that, yet he did, although you
are fully aware that it is beyond your wildest dream that Saddam
Hussein should lie because he who lies will undoubtedly lose the
ability of persuasion, lose the drive for determination and lose
the basic requirements for confidence.
   ``What you, the policy-makers in the United States and your
small agents in the region, hate above all is the veracity of men,
and the most hated among these men is Saddam Hussein because his
sincerity toward principles, toward himself, his people and his
country make of him a true servant and leader of the people, not a
servant for the foreigner. You consider those liars in the region
your trusted friends, although you are fully aware who is the liar
and who are the liars in the region.
   ``The Western public opinion, even the American public opinion,
will be on the side of righteousness so that even when the
confrontation intensifies and the speeches become abundant your
face and that of your mutilated allies will be unveiled and the
Americans will tell you, `We have unified America with blood so why
are you acting against the unity of the people of Iraq who were
split by colonialism and why are you falling in the laps of those
retarded opportunists?'
   ``They will ask you where are these legitimate interests that
are threatened by Iraq? When they realize that Iraq welcomes the
legitimate interests, the anger of the American people will rise
and it is then that your downfall will come and the defeat will be
inevitable for the forces that you had massed and hoped to use to
terrorize the Arab nation, this great nation from which emerged the
prophets and holy books.
   ``You have lied, Mr. U.S. President, to your people when you
told them that you were massing troops to protect American
interests in Saudi Arabia. Now you tell them that you did that to
force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. You never asked yourself if it
is permissible that Iraq asks you to withdraw from southern states
in America. Will you respond to such a request if it were made?
   ``We are on our soil. Kuwaitis and Iraqis are all Iraqis,
eternally. The borders of Iraq, from the begining of times, were
Zako in the north through the city of Nidaa and the city of Kuwait
in the south along the sea. The Iraqis, with their own, irrevocable
will, have become one people as their history dictates, despite the
split caused by colonialism during which, and for a short period,
they lived within fences set up by colonialism.
   ``That era is gone and there is no way that the retarded oil
emirs will ever be allowed back, after they had mutilated the image
of an Arab by sitting on thrones and bringing shame to the Arabs
through their behavior and their alliances with their likes among
the Westerners and the Americans.
   ``You must be loyal to your people, you elected president of the
United States of America. You must tell them that you have made a
mistake and took hasty decisions after you had been misled by those
who misled you.
   ``And then you must ask for our help to save face by agreeing to
measures and arrangements that will not change the core of what has
been achieved in terms of the unit of Iraq, people and land. You
must be sincere to your people and tell them that the Arab and
Islamic public opinion is against your presence on the land of holy
messages and prophets, and against your aggression against sacred
shrines and Iraq. Tell them that they will fight schemes and that
pure souls will be sacrificed in the defense of the principles, the
sacred shrines and patriotic dignity. And you will be defeated
because there is no chance for the bad to win over the good among
people clinging to justice, righteousness and equality.
   ``Mr. President, aren't you sad as you boast about democracy
that your allies are the retarded, thieves and liars among the
Arabs, while the believers, the warriors and the elite be on the
opposite side?
   ``But despite all that, we will continue to pray, and pray hard,
that there will be no confrontation by which you will receive
thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed
them into a dark tunnel.
   ``The doors of heavens are open to all Arabs, and the scent is
so sweet. The opportunity for a respectable life is here and the
doors of Jihad (holy war), which angered the rude Bush, are open to
all Moslems and believers.
   ``God is Great. The Infidels and Aggressors will be defeated.
   ``Pride and dignity will go to the Arabs, Moslems and the
supporters of righteousness.
   ``Saddam Hussein

<TEXT>
   No one knows for sure how many people
have died in Liberia's bloody civil war. This is the story of a
9-month-old baby who survived.
   Last week, doctors from the humanitarian organization Doctors
Without Borders evacuated 300 patients from St. Joseph's Roman
Catholic Hospital in this suburb of Monrovia.
   Heavy fighting was going on next to the hospital, the last
working clinic anywhere near the capital. The doctors could not
take everyone on the long trip behind rebel lines.
   On Tuesday, a foreign correspondent entered the hospital morgue,
which was filled with corpses of those left behind.
   A child was lying next to her mother, eyes frozen in the blank
stare of death. The body of the child's mother lay next to her,
said hospital workers. They did not know how long the woman had
been dead.
   After months of exposure to the brutality of Liberia's war, many
of the journalists covering it have developed thick skins. Fighters
on both sides have gleefully shot civilians in front of journalists
and photographers.
   So it was only a fluke that Steven Smith, looking at the body of
the rail-thin infant, was moved to close the baby's eyes.
   As his thumb brushed the baby's eyelash, she blinked and the
vacant stare transformed into consciousness.
   The girl appeared to have nearly starved to death, having had no
mother's milk or any other food since her mother died.
   After several hours of treatment by one of the Liberian nurses
still staffing the hospital, the baby appeared to have revived. The
next day Smith, Africa editor for the Parisian newspaper
Liberation, decided to find a safer location for the infant.
   There were few people left in Monrovia's eastern suburbs, but
the journalist knew one man who might be able to help. So the child
was taken to an Italian with the last name of Albertini, who
managed an Italian construction company and has stayed behind to
watch over the Italian Embassy residences.
   Albertini, whose first name was not immediately available,
promised he would do what he could to look after the child.
   No one knows the name her parents gave her, but the journalist
said that in recognition of Albertini's compassion, the child would
be called Albertina.

   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder told Virginians on
Thursday night he will freeze state employee salaries, cut state
spending by $375 million and consider eliminating some agencies to
cope with budget woes.
   Some layoffs and office closings will result from the proposals
to deal with a projected $1.4 billion shortfall in the state's $26
billion, 1990-1992 budget, the governor said in a statewide
televised address.
   ``My plan is tough but fair,'' Wilder said. ``This plan requires
government to be more efficient and effective in its use of scarce
resources.''
   Wilder said he would not recommend any increase in taxes, would
not reduce direct aid payments to the poor and medically needy,
would maintain public safety funding and would keep a $200 million
budget reserve for emergencies.
   The major points of his plan included:
   _ Reducing state agency budgets by nearly $375 million over the
next two years.
   ``Every agency of state government, including colleges and
universities, direct service agencies, administrative agencies _
and yes, even the office of the governor _ will reduce
expenditures,'' he said.
   Wilder said some employees will be laid off, some field offices
will be closed and some agencies and programs will be eliminated.
   _ Eliminate state funding for private museums, foundations and
attractions. These projects cost $11 million in the current
two-year budget, he said. Their funding will be reduced this fiscal
year and recommended for elimination next fiscal year, Wilder said.
   _ Continue a moratorium on state construction ``for all but the
most essential projects.'' About $300 million in projected lottery
profits over the next two years will go to operating expenses
instead of building construction.
   _ Withhold 2 percent salary increases that state employees were
to have received in December, saving more than $145 million.
   _ Reduce state aid to localities, which makes up more than half
the state's budget. Wilder did not specify how much aid would be
reduced.
   Wilder said he will ask the General Assembly in January to
eliminate the Department of World Trade and possibly the Department
of Volunteerism, the Council on the Status of Women and the Council
on Indians.
   The governor also said he will look into consolidating
children's services handled by several state agencies.
   He said he would study cutting the use of state-owned vehicles,
cutting the number of field offices in the Department of Motor
Vehicles and providing an early retirement program to reduce the
state work force.
   In a 14-minute televised response, Republicans said the governor
had borrowed many of their ideas for budget cutting but still did
not go far enough.
   ``I think the governor has barely touched on any budget
reform,'' said Del. Clint Miller.
   Another Republican delegate, Vincent F. Callahan Jr., said
Virginians still may wind up paying more taxes despite Wilder's
no-new-taxes pledge.
   The governor did not provide details on how his spending cuts
and other savings would add up to $1.4 billion. He said he would
give specifics in an address Friday to the money committees of the
General Assembly.

   Chill out, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein is catching heavy play on rock 'n' roll radio these
days.
   Disc jockeys across the country are dubbing over pop songs to
produce parodies aimed at Saddam. It evoked memories of the time
when radio stations blasted Iran's taking of American hostages with
the song ``Bomb Iran'' set to the Beach Boys' ``Barbara Ann.''
   The results are often more popular than the top 40.
   To the strains of the Marvelettes' ``Please Mr. Postman,''
WZLX-FM in Boston lambasted Saddam on Wednesday for his country's
march into neighboring Kuwait.
   The song changes the original lyrics from ``Stop, oh yes, wait a
minute Mr. Postman, wa-a-a-it Mr. Postman,'' to ``Oh yeah, wait a
minute Mr. Hussein, Kuwait isn't yours Mr. Hussein.''
   The song continues:
   ``Saddam Hussein is cut off at sea,
   ``Our troops are poised so patiently,
   ``We're gonna be there for a long, long time
   ``You'll have nothing but an empty pipeline ...''
   In Philadelphia, WMGK-FM aired ``I Am Iraq,'' to the tune of
Simon and Garfunkel's ``I Am A Rock,'' on its show ``Harvey in the
Morning.''
   The song blasts Saddam with the lyrics: ``I am the chosen
leader, no I'm not insane, it's right and just because I am
Hussein, I am Iraq, I am a tyrant ...''
   ``It's our biggest hit,'' said Julie Roberts, the show's
producer. ``People want to know where they can buy copies, and
there are a lot of requests. We've gotten a few dozen calls.''
   Saddam has chosen to be known by his first name, but the
songwriters are generally calling him Hussein.
   WTIC-FM in Hartford, Conn., played ``Blame it on Hussein'' to
the tune of Milli Vanilli's ``Blame it on the Rain.''
   The song was part of a station promotion Wednesday in which disc
jockeys dressed as Arab sheiks and a service station offered
drivers premium gasoline for 96 cents a gallon. Traffic tie-ups
forced an early end to the event.
   WHHY-FM in Montgomery, Ala., caused a traffic jam Tuesday when
it held an ``Insane Hussein'' party. There were no song parodies.
But the station gave away five gallons of gas to the first 102 cars
in line and had a dunking booth with a person dressed as the Iraqi
leader.
   Following in the footsteps of history, Rush Limbaugh's
nationally syndicated radio talk show set ``Bomb Iraq'' to
``Barbara Ann.''
   ``We had a guy call up who said, `let's go in there and take
Hussein out,' '' Limbaugh said. ``I said, `here's a song for you,'
and we played it.''
   In Dallas, KMGC-FM dubbed over the Fine Young Cannibals' ``She
Drives Me Crazy'' with the lyrics:
   ``Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   ``So call his bluff, ooh, ooh
   ``Hussein is crazy, and things could really get rough.
   ``Ooh, ooh ...''
   KLZX AM &amp; FM in Salt Lake City serenaded its listeners with
``Iraq, Iraq,'' based on ``New York, New York,'' and ``Hussein,''
sung to Eric Clapton's ``Cocaine.''
   Country and western stations are also getting into the act. Disc
jockey Ken Cooper at KZLA in Burbank, Calif., came up with several
parodies, such as a twist on Hank Williams Jr.'s ``All My Rowdy
Friends Are Coming Over Tonight'' that goes ``All My Saudi Friends
are Coming Over Tonight.''
   Michael Coleman, production director of Boston's WZLX, said the
station's first parody got such a response he decided to produce
several others.
   One, to the tune of ``End of the Line'' by the Traveling
Wilburys, goes:
   ``Well it's an oil fight,
   ``Riding in the Middle East.
   ``Well it's an oil fight.
   ``Iraq is acting like a beast.''
   Others in the works for national airwaves include ``One More in
the Name of Allah'' to U2's ``Pride, in the Name of Love''; ``Me
and Hussein Down by the Oil Field'' to Paul Simon's ``Me And Julio
Down by the Schoolyard''; and ``Who'll Stop Hussein'' to Creedence
Clearwater Revival's ``Who'll Stop the Rain.''
   ``I don't want to make a joke of this,'' Coleman said. ``This is
just tongue-in-cheek, but we have to be careful.''

<HEAD>Saddam Invokes Iraq's Ancient Glory To Become New Nebuchadnezzar</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein is invoking the cultural
glories of Iraq's ancient empires and their legendary warrior-kings
like Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon to enhance his claim to be the
new champion of the Arab world.
   The Iraqi president has rewritten history books and purports to
be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed, who founded Islam in the
6th century. He has employed more than 1,000 workers and spent
millions to rebuild Babylon, capital of Nebuchadnezzar's empire.
   Saddam seeks to rally support among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems and legitimize his crusade against the West and
Israel in their eyes as he finds himself facing a U.S.-led
international quarantine for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Saddam's evocation of Iraq's ancient dynasties has given rise to
suspicions among other Arabs that he harbors imperial ambitions.
   Nebuchadnezzar's empire embraced Kuwait, now gobbled up by Iraq,
and what are now Syria, Jordan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam, 54, has been shrouding himself in the mythology of
Iraq's historical heyday from the 6th century B.C. to the 8th
century to consolidate his power.
   Around this he has created an all-pervasive personality cult.
Huge posters and wall paintings of Saddam in noble pose are
ever-present, as are photos of him on front pages of Iraqi
newspapers.
   A plaque in the Shiite Moslem mosque of Imam Hussein in the holy
city of Karbala in southern Iraq shows a family tree that
supposedly proves that the former peasant boy can trace his lineage
back to Mohammed through the Hashemite kings of Arabia.
   The Information Ministry in Baghdad freely hands out copies,
although the accuracy of the family tree cannot be authenticated
and many non-Iraqi Arabs are highly skeptical of its provenance.
   But to help it along, Saddam has in the last couple of years
rehabilitated the once discredited Hashemite monarchy of Iraq,
overthrown in a 1958 coup and denounced as a British puppet regime.
   Iraqis like to point out that ancient Mesopotamia, in
present-day Iraq, is generally viewed as the cradle of
civilization. Mesopotamis means ``the land between the rivers'' _
the Euphrates and the Tigris.
   Archaeological excavations have produced evidence of settlements
dating from 7,000 B.C. The Garden of Eden is reputed to have been
at Al-Qurna, where the Euphrates and Tigris join.
   Saddam's most ambitious effort to project himself as the new
Nebuchadnezzar has been the resurrection of Babylon, the jewel of
Mesopotamian civilization.
   Saddam began rebuilding Babylon four years ago during the
1980-88 war with Iran. He brought in more than 1,000 laborers from
Sudan to toil in the desert heat on the banks of the Euphrates to
rebuild Nebuchadnezzar's Southern Palace and other parts of the
ruined city, 60 miles north of Baghdad.
   By encouraging Iraqis to steep themselves in the glories of
Babylon, and those of the great Mesopotamian cultures that
flourished around the cities of Nineveh, Nimrud and Ur, Saddam
sought to boost national morale as well as enhance his own dynastic
credentials.
   Nebuchadnezzar was tailor-made for Saddam's grandiose crusade to
portray himself as the savior of the Arabs against Israel.
   The Baylonian king sacked Jerusalem. He took the Children of
Israel into captivity for 50 years and fought for years with the
Persians, ancient enemies of the Arabs.
   Iraqi officials conveniently ignore, however, that the
Achaemenian Persians conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.
   Iraqi history books now refer to Nebuchadnezzar as the defender
of ``the Arab nation,'' even though he lived 1,000 years before
there was such a thing.
   Rebuilding Babylon has cost Iraq millions of dollars while the
country is saddled with a war debt estimated from $50 billion to
$60 billion.
   That does not include the $10 billion owed to Kuwait which the
puppet government Saddam installed there conveniently wrote off.
   Saddam has not restricted himself to identifying with
Nebuchadnezzar. He has likened himself to Hammurabi, who ruled
Babylon in the 17th century B.C. and is credited with drawing up
the world's first written code of law and with razing the cities of
his enemies.
   Mesopotamia was the center of the Parthian empire which emerged
in the 2nd century B.C. and lasted for 400 years. Its capital was
Ctesiphon, whose ruins lie near modern Baghdad.
   The Parthians came later and held back the Romans and the
Byzantine empire until A.D. 637, when they were conquered by the
Arabs sweeping out of the south to spread the new religion of Islam
by the sword.
   In 750, the Abbasids, whose capital was Baghdad, carved out an
Islamic empire stretching from what is now Pakistan to Morocco.
   This was the era of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid, when Baghdad
flowered as the center of Arabic culture and the beguiling city of
the Thousand and One Nights.

Other times, they end wars.
   More often than not, diplomacy is a way to avert bloodshed. It's
a civilized occupation, best performed by representatives of
civilized nations.
   Evidently, it has no place in the Persian Gulf. At least not now.
   President Bush is relying on an economic blockade backed by a
nuclear-armed American naval armada _ not gentle conversation _ to
try to persuade Iraq's Saddam Hussein to reverse his takeover of
Kuwait.
   ``What we need to do at this point is to enforce the
international law,'' Bush said Thursday in dismissing any notion of
using Jordan's King Hussein as a diplomatic intermediary to Baghdad.
   In fact, it turned out the king did not bring Bush any message
from Iraq, where he stopped before flying to Washington and then to
Maine to see the president.
   History provides little evidence that diplomacy works with
dictators or terrorists.
   It did not restrain Moammar Gadhafi of Libya. However, the State
Department detected a marked decrease in terrorism after U.S.
warplanes bombed Tripoli in April 1986.
   In 1981, diplomacy finally achieved the release of 52 American
hostages in Iran. But only after they had spent 444 days in
desperate captivity.
   Six Americans still are being held hostage in Lebanon, despite
questionable overtures to Tehran by the Reagan administration and
repeated intercessions through third parties.
   In confronting Saddam, Bush is using U.S. diplomats in Iraq and
Kuwait solely to convey messages of protest and to insist that the
more than 3,000 Americans trapped in the two countries be permitted
to depart.
   He isn't calling the Americans hostages yet. But neither are
Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other senior U.S.
officials attempting to cultivate the Iraqi leader with sweet talk
or to negotiate a settlement in the gulf.
   They are demanding a full Iraqi withdrawal _ and not very
diplomatically.
   Baker branded Saddam a dictator in a report last week to NATO
foreign ministers in Brussels. Bush has said several times that
Saddam is not a man of his word. Both Bush and Baker have made very
thinly veiled appeals to the Iraqi people to get rid of him.
   The rhetoric is even sharper at the other end. On Thursday, in a
rambling attack carried on Iraqi television, Saddam called the
American president a liar and said the outbreak of holy war _ which
Saddam has called for _ could bring ``thousands of Americans
wrapped in sad coffins.''
   That's the sort of undiplomatic language Saddam used to hurl
against Tehran when he was locked in an eight-year war with Iran.
   But as he tries to wriggle out of Bush's economic noose, Saddam
is not above engaging in diplomacy with the very people in Tehran
who only a few years ago sought to overthrow him.
   On Wednesday, Saddam offered to return seized Iranian territory
and Iranian prisoners, thereby meeting two key Iranian demands.
   The Iraqi leader was not just being nice.
   An accord with Iran would free most of the Iraqi military units
deployed along the border. Saddam also hopes Iran would be so
gratified it would defy the international blockade arranged by Bush
and approved by the U.N. Security Council.
   And who asked Iran to bring whatever pressure it could on Iraq?
   Well, in this upside down world, the United States did _ through
third-party intermediaries.
   That's the same Iran that denounced the United States as ``the
great Satan'' and held 52 Americans in captivity.

<HEAD>Greenhouse Gases Rising in Earth's Atmosphere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carbon dioxide _ the most common of the
so-called greenhouse gases _ is increasing in the Earth's
atmosphere faster than during the 1960s and early 1980s, a federal
agency reports.
   According to a study by Dr. Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, the concentration of carbon dioxide
increased at an average rate of 1.71 parts per million over the
last four years.
   That is somewhat faster than the 1.5 parts per million rise
reported in much of the 1980s. In the 1960s the increase was
reported at only 0.7 parts per million annually.
   ``I think there is a tendency for the rate to be still
increasing, but it doesn't go smoothly, just like the climate,''
Tans said Thursday.
   ``The (carbon dioxide) increase varies a lot from year to year.
One year it can change very little, and the next year it makes up
for the slow increase,'' he explained in a telephone interview.
``At the moment it seems to be increasing fairly fast.''
   Concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, CFC-11
and CFC-12 are monitored by NOAA's Climate Monitoring and
Diagnostics Laboratory in Boulder, Colo.
   The increasing amount of these gases in the air has caused
concern in recent years. The gases are produced by industrial
processes, heating and other human activities as well as some
natural sources.
   Many scientists worry that the gases will act somewhat like a
greenhouse, causing Earth to overheat.
   The shortwave radiation from the sun that warms the Earth passes
through the gases easily, but they can trap the longer wave
radiation from Earth that normally cools the planet and keeps
overall temperatures in balance.
   Global concentrations of carbon dioxide, the most common of the
so-called greenhouse gases, have increased by about 25 percent
since the mid-1800s, to just over 350 parts per million.
   However, scientists disagree over whether any global heating has
already occurred.
   Increasing the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide by 1 part per
million requires the addition of 2.13 billion tons of carbon to the
air. Much of this occurs through the burning of fossil fuels such
as coal and oil.
   Other greenhouse gases are much less common.
   _Methane concentrations rose by 12 parts per billion per year,
although officials said this growth rate may have declined slightly.
   _Nitrous oxide increased at a rate of 0.7 parts per billion per
year.
   _CFC-11 was rising at 10 parts per trillion, while the rate for
CFC-12 was 16 parts per trillion. Both of these chemicals are
chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigeration and other industrial
processes. These chemicals also can damage the Earth's protective
ozone layer, and an international agreement has been signed to
reduce their use.

   The Bush administration largely ignored Iraq's
``brutal and repressive'' human rights record while seeking to
foster good relations with Baghdad before the current Persian Gulf
crisis, a former U.S. diplomat says in a forthcoming book.
   David A. Korn, who worked in the Middle East and Washington for
about 20 years as a foreign service officer, writes that the Reagan
and Bush administrations ``paid scant attention to human rights in
their dealings with Iraq.''
   ``Both have put the nurturing of new friendly relations with
President Saddam Hussein's government well ahead of addressing the
violent and repressive nature of his regime,'' Korn said in
uncorrected page proofs of the book.
   The volume, ``Human Rights in Iraq,'' is scheduled for November
publication by Human Rights Watch and Yale University Press. Human
Rights Watch is a private organization that monitors rights
violations worldwide.
   ``Iraq is a well-organized police state and its government is
one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in power today,''
said Korn.
   President Bush has strongly condemned Saddam in recent days. He
halted trade with Iraq and sent troops to Saudi Arabia in response
to Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait and the massing
of Iraqi troops near the Saudi border.
   As recently as June 15, however, Joshua Gilder, deputy assistant
secretary of state for human rights, told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee that the administration was not prepared to
declare Iraq guilty of ``a consistent pattern of gross violations''
that would trigger sanctions.
   Gilder made the statement after Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
called for an end to U.S. exports to Iraq because of alleged human
rights violations.
   The book details a long history of human rights violations in
Iraq. It does not deal with the human rights records of other
Persian Gulf countries, although Iraq's neighbors also have come in
for sharp criticism.
   ``Iraq is particularly bad, but the other countries in the
region are far from having a clean slate,'' said Laurie Mylroie, an
Iraq analyst with the Harvard Center for Middle East Studies.
``Iraq is probably the worst, then Iran, then Saudi Arabia and then
Kuwait. Palestinians in Kuwait, for instance, live much better than
Palestinians in Iraq.''
   Andrew Whitley of Human Rights Watch in New York said, ``The
Iraqi record, in terms of monolithic political repression and total
abuse of the norms of law and natural justice, is far worse than
any of the others.''
   Amnesty International, another human rights organization, said
last month that members of the Kurdish minority have been subject
to brutal treatment in Iran and Turkey as well as Iraq. The report
said Kurds were victims of a wave of secret executions in Iran that
ended in January 1989.
   One of the most sensational human rights charges against Iraq,
one that Bush has mentioned repeatedly in recent days, involves the
use of poison gas against rebellious Kurds in August 1988. An
official of the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated
that 5,000 Kurds were killed.
   The State Department condemned the action and has consistently
criticized the Iraqis in its annual human rights report. Last year,
the Iraqi human rights record was described as ``abysmal.''
   Nevertheless, wrote Korn, ``the Bush administration did not
raise with Iraqi authorities the report's findings of murder,
extralegal detention, torture and disappearance of political
opponents and government critics, according to State Department
sources.''
   Nathan Kingsley, public affairs advisor in the State
Department's human rights bureau, said, ``Our responsibility is to
deliver a complete, whole, objective analysis of human rights
abuses around the world. That we have done. You can't get much more
public than this report, which, when it comes out, is regarded sort
of universally as the department's position.''
   James Graham, Middle East coordinator for Amnesty International,
said several hundred Iraqi dissidents who had been living in Kuwait
were arrested after the invasion, and the organization had reports
that some of them had been returned to Iraq.
   ``Given the past patterns of that regime, there is good reason
to believe that those people will certainly be imprisoned if not
tortured and executed,'' Graham said.

   A Saudi sheik, known for his fervor at the
gambling table, lost more than $18 million in recent weeks at clubs

gambling at this city's Carlton Club, according to sources quoted
by the news agency Agence France-Presse on Thursday.
   The newspaper Le Parisien, quoting an unidentified witness, said
the sheik, hoping to recover some of his losses, later played
tables at the casino of Monte Carlo in the nearby principality _
only to lose $5.7 million.
   The reports said Eynani was able to make immediate payment of
only 60 percent on the debt.

   There is little time for ceremony
while traveling 530 mph five miles above the ocean.
   ``Pinch 15, are you full?'' asked the airman first class
operating the refueling boom of the Air Force KC-135 tanker.
   ``Pinch 15 is full. Disconnecting,'' said the pilot of the F-4
Phantom fighter flying a scant 20 feet below. The pilot's face was
hidden by his helmet, visor and oxygen mask as the graceful gray
aircraft severed its connection to the tanker in a spray of jet
fuel.
   ``Good journey,'' said the boom operator, and the Phantom was
gone.
   The brief ritual is being repeated often over the Atlantic these
days. While the technological miracle of air-to-air refueling has
long been commonplace, the difference is these pilots are flying to
an uncertainty that may include combat.
   ``We train to do this all the time,'' said the tanker's boom
operator, a 22-year-old Massachusetts woman. ``But it makes it a
little more urgent when it's the real thing.''
   Thursday's mission by the Plattsburgh, N.Y., Air Force Base crew
was one of untold numbers conducted as the U.S. military buildup
grows in the Iraq crisis.
   The refueling of the 24 Phantoms involved eight KC-135s from
Plattsburgh along with eight from Griffiss AFB in New York and
Pease AFB in New Hampshire.
   Details about the total number of missions is classified. Lt.
Col. Rick Oborn, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, would only
say the number of refueling sorties is well above normal military
activity.
   Secrecy was a passenger on Thursday's flight. Journalists aboard
the tanker were asked not to use the names of the crew or identify
the squadron. Squadron emblems and identification patches were
removed from the flight crew's uniforms.
   ``Potential terrorist reprisals,'' explained base spokesman Lt.
Casey Mahon.
   Whatever the number of refueling missions, the stolid tankers,
the military cousin of the Boeing 707 airliner, are a vital link in
the quick deployment of men and material to the Persian Gulf.
   All combat aircraft and many of the transports flying to the
Middle East are potential ``receivers'' that need to be ``dragged
across the pond,'' Air Force lexicon for air-to-air refueling over
the Atlantic.
   ``There aren't too many missions that can take place in the Air
Force without a KC-135,'' said the tanker's pilot, whose husband
also flies the venerable aircraft.
   The tanker's crew of two men and two women was proud of their
role and their aircraft, despite the seemingly glamorless task of
operating a flying gas station. Hot and noisy, permeated with the
odor of its kerosene cargo, the sky-blue airplane was flying well
before John Kennedy was president, before the Beatles, before
Vietnam.
   ``Every time we fly we get pumped up,'' said the pilot, who, at
28, was born three years after her plane went into service.
   Thursday's receivers were Phantoms known as Wild Weasels, based
at George AFB outside Los Angeles. The fighters are loaded with
electronic gear and arms for the high-risk job of disrupting and
destroying enemy radar and anti-aircraft installations.
   That deadly business was made apparent as the thirsty fighters
swung into formation with the tankers 190 miles east of Cape Cod.
Each of the sharp-nosed aircraft carried gleaming white missiles
under its wings.
   Inside the cavernous tanker the 22-year-old boom operator took
her position in the tail of the plane, lying on a platform to
maneuver the 20-foot refueling boom into a port just behind a
fighter's canopy.
   The nimble jet eased into position by listening to quick, curt
instructions from the operator and watching red, green and white
directional signals flashing from the tanker's belly.
   With three fighters flying in formation with the tanker, she ran
through the routine for more than an hour, loading each plane with
900 gallons of JP4 fuel, then adding 400 gallons to top off the
fighters' already emptying fuel tanks.
   When the process was finished, the jets had been ``dragged'' 560
more miles across the ocean. It was time to turn for home. Other
tankers were waiting along the flight path to escort the fighters
farther along their journey.
   And despite the protestations that this was just another
mission, the thoughts of the tanker's crew turned to where the
fighters were heading.
   ``I know what they're going over there for and I think about
them,'' said the plane's captain. ``We're over here in our safe
United States and they're asked to do a lot more than we are right
now.''

   Kuwait City has been eerily silent during
the day, but gunfire crackles in the night as Kuwaitis stage
hit-and-run raids against the Iraqi invaders, refugees say.
   They also claimed Thursday that the Iraqi troops who invaded
Aug. 2 have still not been able to completely stifle resistance by
the citizens of the oil-rich kingdom.
   But some said the Kuwaiti underground is waiting for help from
outside before launching a major offensive against the conquerors.
   ``When the sun shines you're gripped with the awesome silence
and desolation, and after sundown there's the fear of violence and
death,'' said one Kuwaiti, Saeed Hussein.
   ``Resistance has been reactivated, but only after dark.''
   A Kuwaiti woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some
Kuwaiti men ``go out with machine guns every night and kill one or
two Iraqis.''
   There was no independent confirmation of any significant
resistance in the northern Persian Gulf state. The extent of
casualties in what clashes there may be is not known.
Communications with Kuwait are still cut.
   Iraq has an estimated 120,000 troops in Kuwait.
   A growing U.S. force, backed by an international fleet drawn
from the British, French and other navies, is mustering in Saudi
Arabia to face the Iraqis massed along the kingdom's northern
border.
   Kuwait's radio station, once the liveliest in the gulf region,
broadcasts clandestinely, calling for resistance against the Iraqi
invaders.
   ``Kuwait will ... never be part of Iraq,'' announcers stress in
between nationalist songs.
   ``Today brave Kuwaitis in a speeding car hurled a grenade at a
security base, killing a number of Iraqi soldiers and injuring
others,'' it claimed in a broadcast Wednesday.
   Another traveler from Kuwait, who also requested anonymity,
said: ``Resistance is spreading ... Young Kuwaitis don't know mercy
any more.
   Greg Maine, a 35-year-old British businessman, said: ``The world
shouldn't have the impression that Kuwait has been rolled over. The
Kuwaitis are there, waiting for the outside world to act so they
can respond.''
   His wife, Patricia, said the invasion had ``brought out the
best'' in the Kuwaitis. She said some Kuwaitis, who have a
reputation for being prudent with their cash, were handing out
money to those left destitute.
   Most of the refugees fled with few assets from their country,
which once boasted one of the highest per capita incomes in the
world.
   Now the refugees line up for handouts outside the Kuwaiti
Embassy in Bahrain, an archipelago off the coast of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait's southern neighbor.
   The embassy provides mattresses, bedsheets, pillows and other
necessities. The embassy is the only place where the Kuwaiti dinar,
its value demolished by the invasion, can be exchanged at anything
near its former value. Banks won't touch it anymore.
   The Kuwaiti currency was worth $3.50 before the invasion but
plunged below $1 after the invasion. But the embassy changes one
Kuwaiti dinar for one Bahraini dinar, worth $2.65.
   Authorities in Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates
offer the refugees free accommodation. The U.A.E. also provides
every refugee family with $550.
   In Bahrain's markets, a group of Kuwaiti refugees tried to give
vendors Kuwaiti dinars for their fish and shrimp, but the vendors
refused to take any money.
   For many of the refugees, their days are spent in gloomy hotel
rooms, huddled around radio and television sets reporting the
crisis that has made them homeless.

<HEAD>Marketing Orders Cause High Fruit and Vegetable Prices, Critics
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has used so-called
federal marketing orders to give generations of fruit and vegetable
farmers a way to boost prices, but officials say that application
is less prevalent than before.
   Through federal marketing orders, the department can affect the
volume, quality, appearance, packaging or public perception of
about 45 fruit and vegetable crops worth about $4.5 billion a year.
   It's a touchy subject. Defenders of marketing orders insist the
programs assure consumers of consistent supplies and high quality.
   But others claim the system promotes greed and waste by
providing indirect subsidies to favored industries.
   Federal marketing orders for horticultural crops, as fruits and
vegetables are collectively called, are controls authorized by law
to let producers in a geographic area decide as a group how, and
sometimes when, their crops are sold on the market.
   The system is subject to regulations and supervision by the
Agriculture Department, although local boards carry out the
day-to-day functions.
   Nicholas J. Powers of the department's Economic Research Service
says the controls were sanctioned by Congress in the early 1930s,
following earlier attempts by western cooperatives to withhold
produce and limit market sales when supplies were abundant.
   But those attempts failed because not everyone went along with
the co-op efforts, and the U.S. Supreme Court threw out early laws
on controls and taxes for processing.
   Congress finally devised the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act of 1937, the underlying basis for today's marketing orders and
agreements.
   In a report published this month in Farmline magazine, Powers
outlined the different kinds of marketing orders. Virtually all the
orders allow growers to set minimum grade and size requirements. In
many, handlers pay for advertising and promotion programs and for
research on production and marketing.
   Twenty-one marketing orders allow growers to apply some kind of
volume control to limit the amount sent to market during certain
times of the year.
   ``Consumers who buy produce in markets with limited quantities
pay a higher price than otherwise,'' Powers said.
   A few years ago, federal marketing orders generated court
challenges and other snarls. In one case, surplus navel oranges
were used as livestock feed after being barred from the market.
   The conservative Heritage Foundation in 1985 called federal
marketing orders ``government-backed cartels'' that forced
consumers to pay millions of dollars more for food than they would
otherwise.
   But there has been less flak about marketing orders lately, and
Powers, in a telephone interview Thursday, suggested some reasons
why.
   ``Over the last decade, there's been less emphasis on what are
called the volume-control regulations,'' he said. ``Those are the
regulations which can be used to restrict supply to certain markets
and thereby elevate prices in those markets.''
   Marketing orders now ``tend to emphasize more of the
advertising, promotional activities, along with the grading of
produce'' to make sure crops are mature enough for sale to users,
Powers said. Also, more orders emphasize research and packaging of
the produce.
   But volume controls are still used. Last winter, he said, news
reports described how California was controlling the amount of
citrus going to market even after freezing weather had devastated
so much of the Florida citrus crop.
   ``Volume controls are still used in some of the orders but much
less vigorously now than just a few years ago,'' Powers said.
   Powers says the decline in the use of marketing orders also is
due in part to USDA policy, which ``does not encourage the industry
to use volume controls as vigorously as they had in the past.''
   One alternative generally favored by USDA is the use of
marketing orders to formulate promotion and research programs,
which are paid for by the industry itself.
   The 1985 farm law, for example, authorized such a national
program for watermelons, administered by the department's
Agricultural Marketing Service.
   A few of the crops covered by federal marketing orders include
Florida citrus and tomatoes; California peaches, pears and plums;
California and Arizona navel oranges; Idaho and East Oregon
potatoes; Georgia peaches; Virginia and North Carolina potatoes;
Maine potatoes; peanuts grown in 16 states; and Hawaiian papayas.

   Warnings about possible federal layoffs come
when Congress is most vulnerable to public pressure to reach a
budget agreement with the administration, the leader of a
government employees union says.
   ``The administration is reaping the benefits of the timing of
this,'' John Sturdivant, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Government Employees, said Thursday. ``It just
happens to be that these notices are going out when the Congress is
back home.''
   Although complaining that federal employees are being ``kicked
around for political reasons'' again, he said ``elections are an
amazing motivator for people who are elected to do their jobs.''
   Under memos that began going out this week, the nation's 2.4
million federal workers were told that they could face up to 22
days without pay in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 if no
agreement on a deficit-reduction package is reached and mandatory
budget cuts follow.
   Workers subject to the furloughs might be forced to take a day
off without pay in each two-week pay period, said the Office of
Personnel Management.
   Because President Bush and Congress have failed to agree on a
deficit-reduction package, the administration has ordered federal
agencies to draw up plans to cut spending by 31.9 percent.
   As much as $104 billion in spending cuts, known in Washington
jargon as ``sequestration,'' would take effect Oct. 15 unless
Congress and Bush agree on a package of tax increases and spending
reductions.
   ``Our people are outraged. They don't appreciate being jerked
around by the Congress and the White House, and there's certainly
enough blame for both sides,'' Sturdivant said.
   OPM Director Constance Newman advised federal personnel
directors Wednesday that they should begin contacting employees
about the potential layoffs. She noted Bush's announced plans to
implement massive budget cuts Oct. 15 as a result of the
Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   ``It was imperative that they begin making plans now. It's not
our wish that they furlough employees nor are we encouraging them
to do so. It's just an option that they have to consider,'' said
OPM spokeswoman Sharon Wells.
   Under federal law, agencies have to warn workers who might be
threatened by layoffs by at least Aug. 31, a month before the
deadline for reaching a deficit-reduction package.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole was one of the first department
heads to send a memo to agency workers.
   ``I want to emphasize that this does not mean that furloughs are
a certainty, only that they may happen,'' Mrs. Dole wrote.
   Department-wide hiring freezes and cutbacks on travel, equipment
and contracts would be implemented before layoffs, Mrs. Dole said.

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Gulf Operation to Cost $1.18 Billion Through
September</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is putting a $1.18 billion price
tag on the deployment of U.S. air, ground and naval forces in Saudi
Arabia through September.
   According to preliminary figures released Thursday, the Army's
deployment of ground troops supported by aircraft will cost $750
million; the Navy's share, $230 million; and the Air Force's, $200
million.
   No estimate was given for costs beyond next month.
   Chief Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the figures include
neither $120 million in increased fuel costs due to higher oil
prices nor the costs that would be incurred if Bush decides to call
up reserve forces for active duty.
   The deployment, called Operation Desert Shield, began Aug. 8,
two days after President Bush ordered U.S. forces to head for Saudi
Arabia to guard against a possible Iraqi invasion.
   The announcement said costs beyond Sept. 30 could not be
estimated because the size and composition of the armed forces in
Desert Shield and their level of activity ``are still evolving.''
   The Pentagon gave this partial breakdown of the total cost
through Sept. 30:
   _$294 million for transport of cargo by commercial and
government aircraft. Activation and deployment of additional
transport ships cost $74 million.
   _Imminent danger and family separation pay totals $50 million.
   _Use of volunteer reserve units for airlift, tanker refueling
and cargo handling cost $12 million.
   _Activation and deployment of two hospital ships cost $10
million.
   _$25 million for medical supplies.
   _Chemical protective equipment at a cost of $56 million.

<HEAD>US Pilots Lock in Iraqis on Radar But `They Don't Want to Play'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: This is based on a pool dispatch</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American pilots have locked in their weapons
radar on Iraqi planes in what one crew chief described as ``a
little cat and mouse'' game that the Iraqis refuse to go along
with, U.S. airmen say.
   ``They don't want to play with us,'' one crew chief said
Thursday. ``If I were in a Mirage and an F-15 locked onto me, I'd
get out of there fast, too.''
   When an American jet's weapons systems radar locks onto another
plane, it means the U.S. jet has found its target and communicated
that to its missile.
   The Iraqi pilot knows it, too, because his plane carries a
warning system something like the ``fuzzbuster'' radar used by some
automobile drivers in America to warn them that they're under the
scrutiny of police radar.
   Although the U.S. airmen declined to go into detail, there was
no indication that any of the encounters involved Iraqi planes
attempting to intrude into Saudi Arabian air space. The airmen
suggested that the encounters occurred during missions near the
border with Kuwait.
   Col. John McBroom, commander of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing
from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, refused to confirm the
pilots' reports and said he had instructed his airmen not to
discuss any contact with Iraqi jets.
   ``I'm not going to get into our encounters,'' he said.
   But McBroom did say he considered U.S. air power here far
superior to Iraq's.
   ``We're not over here to go to war,'' McBroom said, ``but we
will finish one quickly in the air.''
   Another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said there
have been several instances in which weapons systems aboard U.S.
F-15s locked onto the Iraqis' French-made Mirage jets.
   ``One of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the
radar locks on,'' one crew chief said.
   ``There's been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock
on, they're gone,'' said another.
   Asked again about the encounters, McBroom said: ``All I'll do is
remind you our radar can lock on at a pretty good range. Beyond
that you'll have to ask the Iraqis.''
   He seemed to be suggesting that the episodes involved Iraqi
planes flying well within Kuwaiti airspace.
   In Washington, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said
he had asked military officials about the report but had received
no information that would enable him to confirm or deny the
accuracy of the crew chiefs' remarks.
   McBroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the
ground when it arrived last week. But now it has received powerful
ground protection from other U.S. forces, including Patriot
ground-to-air missile systems.
   The unit has set up camp at a Saudi air base. It uses spare
Saudi hangars, maintenance garages and other facilities.
   Ground rules for the a pool of U.S. reporters flown here by the
Pentagon prohibit disclosure of the base's location, the number of
planes and other weapons systems or the names of non-command
officers.
   The men are living in Saudi barracks and schools. But a tent
city is under construction on the base, as is a portable hospital.
   Heat is a big problem. The hospital is treating about 15 cases
of heat stress a day, Air Force officials said.
   Interviews with the airmen were conducted between 9 a.m. and 10
a.m. local time, when temperatures already were approaching triple
digits and the sun was scorching.
   One Air Force sergeant was taken to the hospital during the
pool's visit for a minor case of heat stress. He had been swinging
a sledge hammer for several hours helping to set up the tents.
   McBroom said the Saudi base facilities are the best he has ever
seen.
   ``The Saudis build everything big and everything right,'' he
said.
   McBroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they
have had very few equipment problems associated with the heat. Most
of the planes are being kept outdoors in the heat because
electronic systems sometimes have temporary troubles when going
from a cool to hot environment, McBroom said.
   The Air Force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets, and
crews were seen unloading boxes of 20mm shells for their on-board
guns as well.

   India's foreign minister planned to meet with
Saddam Hussein in Baghdad today to ask that 185,000 Indian citizens
be allowed to leave Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Speaking Thursday in Washington before his overseas flight,
External Affairs Minister Inder K. Gujral said he also would do
whatever possible to prevent a flare-up of hostilities in the
Persian Gulf region.
   But he emphasized he is neither a mediator nor a messenger and
suggested the crisis is not yet ripe for mediation.
   ``To tell Saddam Hussein to let my people come out, that is my
primary concern, and also to try to see if better sense can prevail
on all sides to see that the situation does not go to the flare
point,'' Gujral told reporters after conferring by telephone with
Indian Prime Minister V. P. Singh.
   He met Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow
Tuesday, then flew here for talks with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III on Wednesday and national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft on Thursday.
   Gujral said there are 10,000 Indian citizens in Iraq and 175,000
in Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   About 1,600 ``Randonneur'' bicycles, marketed
nationwide between January 1982 and June 1984, have been
voluntarily recalled by Bianchi, USA, Inc., of San Francisco
because of potentially defective front forks, the government says.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday it knows of
three cases in which riders suffered broken bones in crashes caused
by sudden breakage of the forks at the junction of the crown and
blade.
   Bianchi will provide new forks at no charge under terms of the
recall, coordinated with CPSC. Only Randonneur bicycles with the
letter ``B'' on the crown of the fork are involved, the agency said.
   Owners may call their nearest Bianchi dealer or the firm's
toll-free number, 1-800-699-6400, extension 200, to learn if their
bicycles are subject to the recall.

   It will take at least five years for the
United States to emerge from its drug crisis, the new head of the
federal Drug Enforcement Administration says.
   ``Let us remember that it took over 20 years to get ourselves

during his swearing-in ceremony on Thursday.
   ``It is going to take at least five years, and perhaps more, of
steady effort and involvement by all segments of our society to

DEA headquarters to see him take the oath of office from Supreme
Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
   Bonner, 48, had been a U.S. District Judge in Los Angeles since

<HEAD>Most Adult Men In Ivory Coast Capital Die From AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS has become the leading cause of death
among adult men in the West African city of Abidjan, the magazine
Science says. It is the second most common cause in adult women
there, after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion.
   A recent study in the Ivory Coast capital city found a minimum
annual incidence of AIDS of 1,447 cases per million in adult men
and 340 per million in adult women, Science said in its Aug. 17
edition.
   The study of cadavers was done in a 62-day and 43-day period.
Among 698 adult bodies examined, 41 percent of men and 32 percent
of women were infected with HIV, the agent that causes Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome. The highest rates were found in men and
women aged 30 to 39.
   Science said the figures ``probably underestimate the true
mortality due to HIV infection.'' Among factors skewing the figures
were the exclusion of pediatric patients, the unknown proportion of
AIDS deaths not brought to the mortuaries studied, and the cultural
practice of seriously ill persons leaving Abidjan to die in their
home areas.
   In addition, deaths due to pulmonary tuberculosis _ the third
ranking cause of male adult death _ specifically were not counted
as AIDS cases, although 50 percent of such cadavers tested HIV
positive.
   ``Although data concerning mortality due to AIDS are scarce,''
the article said, ``AIDS is likely to be the leading cause of adult
death in a number of other African cities also.''
   In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease
Control, there were 16.1 cases of AIDS per 100,000 population in
the year ending in July.

<HEAD>Agency Considers Ban On Crib Toys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission is
considering a ban or limit on what toys and decorations can be hung
over infant cribs.
   The decision to consider the problem, approved Thursday on a 2-1
vote, calls for the staff to investigate solutions to the hazards
posed by such items. The commission received reports of 30
strangulation deaths, one case of severe brain damage, and 18
``near-misses'' involving decorative ropes or mobiles for cribs.
   The Consumer Federation of American and the New York attorney
general's office petitioned the agency for an outright ban of the
items. Thursday's vote means the panel will await further
recommendations of its staff and general comment from the public
before deciding upon any mandatory requirements.
   One alternative to banning the products, said staff member Ann
Pavlich, might be labeling which warns parents to remove the
overhead crib items before infants are large enough to reach them
and try to pull themselves upright _ possibly to tumble with them
wrapped around their neck. She suggested an age guideline might be
5 months.
   Such ``crib toys'' or ``gyms'' are not to be confused with
separate baby toys, designed for actual handling by the infant, and
for which the government has long since set safety standards.

<TEXT>
   Israel's chief rabbi has ruled Ultra-Orthodox
Jewish men may shave their beards so gas masks fit properly in the
event of a chemical attack by Iraq, and he urged them to carry
scissors to shave quickly.
   Law forbids men from shaving, and many ultra-Orthodox men grow
full beards and wear side curls.
   But traditional gas masks won't seal properly over facial hair
and the issue had caused great anxiety among Israel's
ultra-Orthodox community until Thursday's ruling by Chief Rabbi
Mordechai Eliyahu.
   The government has considered distributing masks because of
threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to attack the Jewish
state with chemical weapons. Private sales of masks have boomed.
   The religious weekly Yom Hashishi on Thursday suggested
ultra-Orthodox men consider acquiring gas masks designed for
children because they cover the entire head.
   But the Civil Defense agency, responsible for procuring and
distributing gas masks, has said catering to the needs of bearded
men would not be possible because the masks are mass-produced.
   In his ruling, Eliyahu said that although Jewish tradition
always spoke of Jewish men wearing beards, there was no prohibition
against shaving in the body of Jewish law.
   ``Bearded men have to shave off their beards before wearing a
gas mask since even a two-day beard prevents the mask from sealing
properly and may allow the gas to penetrate inside,'' he said.
   Eliyahu also said bearded men should carry scissors in their
pocket in case they need to shave in a hurry, the national Itim
news agency reported.

<TEXT>
   A thin washer may have caused the focusing
flaw in the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, and a space
shuttle mission can easily fix much of the problem, NASA officials
say.
   ``The Hubble could actually be better than it could be now,''
Charles Pellerin, NASA director of astrophysics, said Thursday.
   Pellerin and members of a NASA investigative team held a news
conference after two days of hearings at Hughes Danbury Optical
Systems Inc., maker of the flawed primary mirror that is producing
blurry pictures from the orbiting observatory.
   The mirror has an aberration caused by a 1.3-millimeter error in
a measuring device that was used to grind the telescope's mirrors,
said Lew Allen, head of the team and director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The error that we discovered is one that leads to an
essentially pure spherical aberration, and that's relatively easy
to correct,'' Allen said.
   Pellerin said that all that needs to be done is remove the
Hubble's wide-field planetary camera during a previously scheduled
shuttle mission in 1993 and replace it with a camera designed to
correct the error.
   The camera was going to be replaced during the 1993 mission
anyway because machinery undergoes extraordinary wear and tear in
space, Pellerin said.
   ``The only thing that's different is we didn't anticipate doing
this because of optical problems,'' he said.
   The main camera is the Hubble's most powerful instrument,
designed to peer almost to the edge of the universe and produce the
telescope's most exciting discoveries.
   NASA officials said earlier that replacing the camera won't
solve the problem for the Hubble's faint-object camera and other
instruments, which still will receive poorly focused light from the
flawed mirror. Compared with the main camera, however, those
instruments are much less severely impaired by the bad mirror.
   The discovery of the flaw shortly after the Hubble was launched
April 25 proved a major embarrassment for NASA. The telescope is
designed to take clearer pictures of the far reaches of space than
are possible from ground-based telescopes.
   The 1.3-millimeter error was discovered in a device called a
reflective null corrector, NASA officials said.
   Allen said that simple washers might have thrown off the entire
instrument because the washers appear to be the same thickness as
the error. But he said that could be a coincidence, and the team
will study many other possibilities.
   The 1.3-millimeter error is huge in optics terms, Allen said.
Pellerin likened it to a room that was accidentally built 3 feet
too long.
   Allen said a test had indicated the error when the mirror was
manufactured in the early 1980s at a division of Perkin-Elmer Corp.
that was bought last year by Hughes. But he said Perkin-Elmer
engineers had placed complete faith in the null corrector and
disregarded the test results.
   While declining to say whether Hughes Danbury was to blame for
the error, Allen did say NASA was not aware of the results that
showed there was an error.
   ``As we go back through the documents, we don't find any case
where they called this to the attention of NASA,'' he said.
   Thomas Arconti, spokesman for Hughes Danbury, said only that the
company would continue to work with NASA to find the answers to the
remaining questions.
   Pellerin said the news would not shake NASA's confidence in
Hughes Danbury, which is working on other NASA optics projects and
made other highly technical parts of the telescope. ``Everything
that's difficult is working fine,'' he said.
   Allen said during the team's two days at Hughes Danbury, it
interviewed former and current employees who worked on the
telescope. He said they were all cooperative, even though it was
hard for them to accept that they had made an error.
   ``People find it very hard to say `oops,' '' he said. ``They
instead say that we had good reasons for doing what we did, we had
no reason to think it was wrong and so on. ... Everyone we talked
to is finding it very hard to not be proud of what he did when he
thought it was very good work.''
   The team will return to Hughes Danbury on Sept. 12 and 13, Allen
said.

   Japanese officials today began investigating
reports that U.S. jet fighters buzzed Japanese pleasure boats as
imaginary targets during training flights.
   U.S. military officials said Navy aircraft were training in the
area Wednesday where two yachts were buzzed by jet fighters.
   The U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, would
not give any further details about the incidents, in which a man
was injured after a low-flying fighter buzzed his yacht.
   Japan's Maritime Safety Agency has received reports from local
fishermen and boat captains of similar incidents occurring in the
same area during the last two months, agency spokesman Naoki Maeda
said.
   The presence of the U.S. armed forces in Japan under a mutual
security pact is still a sensitive topic, and reports of accidents
involving U.S. military personnel receive wide publicity.
   He quoted one person as saying that earlier this month two jets
with U.S. military marks suddenly flew down very low as if they had
been aiming at yachts near Oshima, an island 70 miles south of
Tokyo.
   Japanese newspapers quoting U.S. military sources said the jets
involved in Wednesday's incidents were FA-18 fighters attached to
the aircraft carrier Midway.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Japanese officials believed the
fighters were using the pleasure craft as imaginary enemy targets.

<HEAD>Rebels To Urge U.N. Human Rights Observers In Salvadoran Peace
Talks,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARLOS SANDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran rebel leaders say they
will ask President Alfredo Cristiani to accept U.N. human rights
observers as a condition for an immediate cease-fire in El
Salvador's decade-old civil war.
   The proposal will be presented later today when the latest round
of peace talks begins in San Jose, according to Miguel Saenz, a
spokesman for the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   ``If the Salvadoran government accepts that such a commission
oversee observance of human rights in the country, then agreement
could be reached for a cease-fire at this meeting,'' Saenz said
Thursday.
   The five-day meeting, under U.N. mediation, is the fourth round
of talks between the rebels and the government since Cristiani took
office last year.
   The previous rounds ended in deadlock, with the government
insisting the rebels enter into a cease-fire agreement before any
other issues were discussed.
   Rebel leaders have demanded political reform, principally that
the government purge the armed forces of rightist elements and
bring human rights violators to justice.
   Saenz said that establishing a U.N. human rights commission in
El Salvador would be an effective way of getting around the
deadlock.
   Human rights groups say 73,000 people have died since El
Salvador's civil war began in 1979 and nearly half were civilians
slain by the military or rightist death squads for suspected
leftist sympathies.
   Last November, six Jesuit priests were roused from their beds at
night in their university campus home in San Salvador and shot dead
by uniformed soldiers along with their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The assassinations took place at the height of a guerrilla
assault on the Salvadoran capital, and while that section of the
city was under military control and a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Meanwhile, in El Salvador, repair crews today were restoring
power to large sections of the country blacked out by guerrilla
sabotage earlier this week.
   Officials of the state-owned Lempa Executive Commission said the
rebels attacked 17 main transmission lines, knocking out power to
nearly half of the small Central American nation of 5 million
people.

   A woman who says she has 21 personalities
displayed three of them _ herself and characters named Franny and
Jennifer _ in testifying she was raped by a man who took her out
for coffee.
   The judge required her to take an oath each time she changed
identities during the hearing Thursday. Lawyers introduced
themselves to the different personalities. Each time, she behaved
as if the testimony was just beginning.
   After hearing the testimony, Judge Robert Hawley ordered Mark A.
Peterson, 29, to stand trial for sexual assault. No trial date was
set.
   To convict Peterson, District Attorney Joseph Paulus said he
must prove three things _ that the victim had a mental illness,
that she was incapable of appraising her own conduct and that
Peterson knew about the illness.
   Peterson claims the woman consented to sex and that he did not
know she had multiple personalties.
   But the woman said she told Peterson she had multiple
personalities and introduced him to some of them, and that he took
advantage of one of them _ Jennifer, a fun-loving 20-year-old.
   That personality was dominant when Peterson forced her to have
sex in the front seat of a car after they went out for coffee, the
woman said.
   On Thursday, she also testified as herself, a 26-year-old single
Oshkosh woman who is in therapy for multiple personality disorder
and cannot remember the incident, and as Franny, a 32-year-old
motherly type who reported the alleged attack to friends.
   According to Leonard Kaplan, a University of Wisconsin Law
School professor, state law clearly says that someone deemed
mentally ill cannot consent to sex.
   Defense lawyer Edward Salzsieder said the key issue is whether
the woman is mentally ill or just a ``big show.''
   During about 90 minutes of testimony, the woman paused only
briefly during personality switches requested by Paulus.
   ``Can I have Jennifer, the one who likes to have fun?'' Paulus
asked after talking with Franny.
   ``Of course,'' the woman replied, smiling and closing her eyes.
Seconds later, she opened her eyes and blurted, ``Hi, Mr. Paulus''
in a slightly higher voice.
   The woman, her therapist seated nearby, testified that Peterson,
a man she met two days earlier while fishing, raped her June 11.
She testified Peterson wanted Jennifer to appear. She said he
asked: ```Can I love you?' I said, `OK.'''
   Jennifer did not know what sex was but agreed because ``he just
told me to,'' the woman said.
   Police said Peterson noted that during sex, the woman's
6-year-old personality, Emily, appeared before she eventually
became Franny again.
   Inam Haque, a psychiatrist at Winnebago Mental Health Institute
in Oshkosh, testified he treated the woman for four years and
diagnosed her in February as suffering from multiple personality
disorder.
   The disorder is triggered by emotional or physical abuse during
childhood. Victims create separate personalities to avoid
confronting reality. It affects about 7,000 Americans, he said.

<HEAD>American Experts Search For Remains In Vietnam</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vietnam has shown American military
experts 70 sets of remains of what the Vietnamese believe could be
missing U.S. soldiers, a U.S. official said today.
   The remains were shown to an American team that arrived Aug. 6
in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, to begin a joint search
expedition, said Lt. Col. James Spurgeon.
   Spurgeon said he did not know if the Americans had made an
assessment of the 70 remains. Spurgeon is the chief representative
in Thailand of the Joint Casualty Resolution Center, a Hawaii-based
military agency that accounts for America's wartime missing.
   Usually, remains suspected to be those of Americans are flown to
Hawaii for analysis. Most remains recovered by the Vietnamese have
not been those of Americans missing in action.
   The Pentagon lists 2,300 Americans as missing from the war that
ended in 1975 with communist victories in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia. About 70 percent are missing in Vietnam.
   The current search is the 11th joint search with Vietnamese
workers. It began the same day the Americans and Vietnamese held,
at the United Nations, their first talks on ending the war in
Cambodia between guerrillas and the Vietnamese-installed government.
   The United States and Vietnam do not have diplomatic relations,
and previous talks were limited to humanitarian issues such as the
missing in action.

<HEAD>Actors' Equity Says OK for White Actor to Play Part</HEAD>

   Actors' Equity bowed to pressure from within its
ranks and agreed to let a white actor play a Eurasian pimp in the
Broadway production of the hit London musical ``Miss Saigon.''
   Now the question is whether the show will go on.
   Producer Cameron Mackintosh, who had scrapped the $10 million
show after the union's initial ban on Jonathan Pryce, said Thursday
he will confer with the English actor and the ``Miss Saigon''
creative team to determine whether it can still be brought to
Broadway.
   A decision is not expected until next week, said Mackintosh
spokesman Marc Thibodeau.
   ``Miss Saigon,'' which was to have begun previews here in March,
already has $25 million in advance ticket sales, the largest in
Broadway history. Mackintosh has said the cancellation would cost
him about $600,000.
   Actors' Equity, which has a veto over foreign actors in the
United States, had denied permission Aug. 7 for Pryce to repeat his
London performance because casting a white actor in Asian makeup is
``an affront to the Asian community.''
   The decision stirred fierce debate over color-blind casting,
minority opportunities on stage and artistic freedom. Some
complained it called into question the nature of acting itself _
pretending to be someone the actor is not.
   Equity reversed itself at a special meeting Thursday of its
70-member council, called in response to a petition from more than
600 Equity members outraged by the decision to bar the actor. The
union has 37,500 active members.
   Alan Eisenberg, the union's executive secretary, said the
council was influenced by a demonstration of good intent by the
producer.
   Mackintosh had said that Pryce eliminated his slanted-eye makeup
immediately after learning that it ``offended members of the
American-Asian community.''
   In addition, the union said it had a commitment from Mackintosh
to seek out Asian actors for Broadway roles and to help give them
voice training.
   In explaining the reversal, Eisenberg said the council, which
met for nearly six hours, determined that Pryce qualified as a
``star.'' Stars from other countries usually get automatic approval
to perform in the United States.
   Pryce has appeared on Broadway twice, winning a Tony in 1977 for
his performance in ``Comedians'' and starring in ``Accidental Death
of an Anarchist'' in 1984.
   Eisenberg said the controversy highlighted the need for the
theater to address ``the frustrations felt over past and present
discriminations and the lack of employment opportunities'' for
minority actors.
   On Wednesday, Asian-Americans had urged Equity not to waver in
its decision to bar Pryce.
   ``In an ideal world, any artist can play any role for which he
or she is suited,'' said Tisa Chang, artistic director of the Pan
Asian Repertory Theater. ``Until that time arrives, artists of
color must fight to retain access to the few roles which are
culturally and racially suited to them.''
   Mackintosh has said the show has a cast of 50 actors, including
roles for 34 minority performers. No other casting, except Pryce,
has been announced.
   ``Miss Saigon'' is a love story about an American soldier during
the closing days of the Vietnam War in 1975.
   Pryce won the Olivier Award, London's equivalent of the Tony,
for his portrayal of the Engineer, a brothel owner, in ``Miss
Saigon.''

   The ``Village With A Smile'' isn't
anymore.
   Gone are the yellow, empty-eyed smiley faces that stared
oncoming motorists in the face as they drove through this suburb
west of Chicago.
   Some residents and city officials thought the symbol of
happiness _ an image from the 1970s _ was behind the times.
   ``It was just a little out of fashion,'' said resident Donna
Danielson. ``Sometimes people would make fun _ like co-workers.''
   So she and her husband, Dan, offered to redesign the village's
vehicle stickers and city limit signs. The new city symbol is now a
leafy branch with a cardinal perched on top.
   ``You just can't say anymore `Hey, don't worry about it _
smile,' '' said Danielson, an advertisement designer in Chicago.
``I think there is a lot more depth to Forest Park than a smiley
face.''
   Smiley faces also have been falling from fashion graces outside
Forest Park. A survey conducted last year by the Roper Organization
at 10 U.S. college campuses found the ``Have-a-nice-day'' face was
a fashion no-no.
   The loss of the smiles has been greeted with some frowns.
   ``I just thought it was unique,'' said Edward Lambke, who headed
the effort to adopt the smiley face while serving as a village
commissioner.
   ``They've changed the smiley. Never if I was there would that
ever happen. I thought it was good for the town and I still do.''
   Lambke, who coined Forest Park's nickname, ``A Village With A
Smile,'' has since retired from village government but has left the
vehicle stickers on his car.
   The smiley faces were painted on water towers at both ends of
the town in 1974. In 1986, the smileys were adopted for the car
stickers to give the village individuality in a sea of suburbs.
   Judging by some reactions to the new symbol, the village may be
a happier place without the smiley faces.
   ``Some people would pick up their (new) sticker and say, `Oh my
gosh, I'm glad you got rid of it,' '' said village clerk Marlene J.
Quandt. ``I just think it had seen its day.
   ``But there are those who express a little sadness when they see
the smiley face isn't here anymore.''
   Forest Park has not entirely abandoned the smiley face, however.
No one has dared contend with the giant saffron smiles on the water
towers.
   The Danielsons say those faces might have to wait a few years
until the towers need a new coat of paint.

   Four sheriffs, a deputy sheriff and a
police chief caught up in an FBI sting code-named Walking Short
have been charged with setting up a protection racket for drug
traffickers.
   Two FBI agents acting as Chicago businessmen interested in
shipping cocaine led the yearlong sting, whose name was inspired by
the 1973 movie ``Walking Tall,'' about a Tennessee sheriff who did
not cave in to corruption around him.
   Forty FBI agents fanned out through four contiguous eastern
Kentucky counties to make the arrests Thursday. The six were
indicted on charges of conspiracy, drug distribution and taking
money to protect drug traffickers.
   U.S. Attorney Louie DeFalaise said the arrests demonstrated
``the absolute corrupting influence of drugs.''
   Arrested were Lee County Sheriff Johnny Mann, 39; Breathitt
County Sheriff Dean Spencer, 46; Wolfe County Sheriff Lester Drake,
51; Owsley County Sheriff Billy McIntosh, 57; Beattyville Police
Chief Omer Noe, and Wolfe County deputy Sheriff Wilson Stone.
   At a hearing Thursday, five of the men were released on bail
ranging from $5,000 to $20,000. Mann, the alleged ringleader, was
denied bail after an undercover agent testified he had threatened
to kill anyone who set him up.
   According to the indictment, agents paid the law officers more
than $85,000 to protect a phony cocaine and marijuana smuggling
operation from police interference.
   At one point, cocaine packages were dropped by air onto a farm
owned by one of the officers, authorities said.
   DeFalaise said the cocaine, which totaled nearly 250 pounds, was
never distributed for sale to the public.
   Most of the drug counts carry up to life in prison. The major
conspiracy and extortion charges carry up to 20 years.

<TEXT>
   A Shiite Moslem leader says the U.S.
military intervention in Saudi Arabia ``leaves no chance'' for a
quick release of any Americans held hostage in Lebanon.
   But Hussin Musawi, a reputed mentor of pro-Iranian kidnap
factions in Lebanon, said Thursday that a Western European hostage
might be freed soon.
   Musawi spoke hours after the leftist Beirut newspaper As-Safir
said all 14 Western hostages held in Lebanon, including six
Americans, will be freed by year's end.
   ``I think there is a demarcation line between American and
European hostages,'' Musawi said in a telephone interview from his
home in Baalbek.
   ``I think the American occupation of Saudi Arabia leaves no
chance for an early release of the American captives. But there is
a chance the case of the European hostages might shortly ease up.''
   Musawi leads a pro-Syrian wing in the fundamentalist Hezbollah,
or Party of God, Iran's main ally in Lebanon. Hezbollah is believed
the umbrella for several hostage-holding factions.
   He said the outlook for the European captives was brighter
because France has taken an independent stance from the United
States in the gulf crisis.
   French President Francois Mitterrand's decision to release Anis
Naccache, a Lebanese serving life for trying to assassinate former
Iranian Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar in Paris in 1980, was a
contributing factor, Musawi said.
   All French hostages have been freed. Four Britons, two West
Germans, an Italian and an Irishman, as well as six Americans, are
held by extremist Moslem groups in Lebanon. Most have been held
three years or more. The longest held, since March 16, 1985, is
Terry Anderson, the AP's chief Middle East correspondent.
   As-Safir quoted unidentified diplomatic sources as saying
``secret contacts . . . involving the concerned capitals,
particularly Tehran,'' were under way to resolve the hostage issue.
   The hostage-takers have made various demands for the release of
prisoners held by Israel in southern Lebanon and of convicted
terrorists jailed in Kuwait and Western capitals.
   Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which set off the
crisis, no firm word has emerged on the fate of 15 Shiite prisoners
whose release was demanded by kidnappers in return for American
hostages.
   Most were serving long prison terms and three were awaiting
execution for involvement in 1983 bombings the U.S. and French
embassies and Kuwaiti installations.
   Some reports said the prisoners escaped after the invasion,
others said they were killed and some suggested they were moved to
Baghdad, Iraq's capital.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading killer of American women in the
workplace isn't crashes or fire. It's homicide.
   The Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that 42
percent of the on-the-job injury deaths of women in the United
States from 1980 to 1985 were homicides.
   Second was vehicle accidents, at around 39 percent, said
Catherine Bell, an epidemiologist with the CDC's National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health.
   ``If a woman's going to die from an injury at work, she's
probably going to be murdered,'' Ms. Bell said.
   NIOSH investigators identified 950 female occupational homicides
over the six-year period. Of that number, 389 _ or 41 percent _
worked in the retail field.
   Researchers aren't certain, but it appears that strangers in the
store _ not co-workers _ are responsible for most workplace
killings of women, Ms. Bell said.
   ``They appear to be robbery-associated crimes in the retail
trade,'' she said. ``It quite likely is stranger violence.''
   The killings peaked in the winter months. Sixty-four percent of
the killings were committed with guns; 19 percent were stabbings.
   Nationwide, for both sexes, about 13 percent of on-the-job
injury deaths during 1980-85 were homicides, the CDC reported.
Homicides accounted for 12 percent of men's occupational
fatalities, compared with the 42 percent for women.
   Findings regarding killings of men in the workplace are not
complete. But most on-the-job deaths involve male workers _ who
traditionally dominate more dangerous occupations _ and most of
those male workplace deaths are accidental.
   The CDC did not release figures for causes of workplace injury
deaths among women other than homicides and vehicular accidents.
   Measures such as better lighting, safer cash-handling and even
bulletproof barricades should be considered to help stop slayings
at work, the agency said.
   The workplace homicide rate for black women was nearly double
that for white women, but that was not necessarily unexpected;
nationwide, black women are nearly four times as likely to be
murdered as white women, the CDC said, citing a 1986 study.

   Eleven U.S. students have spent the
summer near the Mexican border listening to horror stories and
trying to give them happy endings.
   They weren't studying fiction _ they're trainee human rights
activists.
   The students from colleges across the nation served as interns
for Amnesty International. For 10 weeks, they worked on behalf of
asylum-seekers who claim to be fleeing harassment, torture and
death squads from Haiti to El Salvador.
   In the process, they became skeptical of their own government.
   ``Everything is really interconnected,'' said Amy Voege, a
23-year-old junior at Central Michigan University in Mount
Pleasant, Mich.
   ``The people who are fleeing their countries are fleeing because
of human rights abuses there, or fleeing because of war there,''
she said. ``But those human rights abuses and those wars are really
supported by the United States government.''
   They will take back memories of those they helped. Among them
was a Honduran soldier who said he was beaten for refusing to
torture prisoners, and a Guatemalan who said he fled after seeing
soldiers shoot to death his cousin.
   Amnesty International said its ``Asylum Summer'' program tries
to help asylum-seekers from being deported and becoming abuse
victims.
   Critics, including some within the nearly 1 million-strong
movement, worry that the group is departing too much from its
traditional role of campaigning for people unlawfully imprisoned,
tortured or facing the death penalty.
   The students, ages 18 to 23, trained in southern Texas with
human rights organizations and helped prepare legal cases.
   In one case, a 17-year-old Salvadoran army deserter won asylum
with help from students assigned to ProBAR, a legal aid office in
Harlingen.
   Melissa Jameson, 19, a sophomore at the University of Redlands
in Redlands, Calif., said the man was forcibly recruited, then
``made to torture and kill animals for training. They had to bite
the necks of vultures and dogs.''
   ``Then the trainers cut off the arm of a human body and played
with it like a toy,'' Jameson said. ``They said this will make you
more of a man, and when he cried they said you're going to have to
get used to this.''
   The man, whom she did not identify, claimed he would be tortured
or killed by government forces or harassed by guerrillas if sent
back.
   In another case, asylum was denied to a Honduran who said he was
forcibly recruited into the army at 14 and was beaten and tortured
when he refused to torture prisoners. The youth, who is appealing
the denial of asylum, also said he feared being tortured if
returned home.
   ``We had won an asylum case for a Honduran young man who had
faced pretty much the same thing,'' said Mercedeh Momeni, 22, of
Fredericksburg, Va. ``It just shows how arbitrary the system is,
and how Amnesty is on the right track in this program.''
   The interns complained that U.S. governments helped create the
conditions that force people to flee Central America, and that
those fleeing unfriendly countries seem to have a better chance of
winning asylum than refugees from allied nations.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service said each asylum case
is treated on merit, without political bias.
   ``Isn't it logical that the United States would have better
relations with countries that do not practice human rights abuses,
than with countries that do?'' asked INS spokesman Duke Austin.
``To argue that there's no difference between Nicaragua, El
Salvador, Cuba and Haiti is asinine. That's naivete in its highest
form.''
   The Border Association for Refugees from Central America in
McAllen had three students assigned to its office.
   ``It's extremely important for young people in the United States
to become more involved in justice-related issues,'' said executive
director Ninfa Krueger.
   The students said they plan to step up their human rights
activities in their schools. But, said Paula Couture, 21, a junior
at Worcester State College at Worcester, Mass., ``People aren't
going to understand us when we get back.''

<HEAD>Pilots Used Credit Cards to De-ice Plane</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crew members of a commuter plane that
crashed last year, killing six people, used credit cards to scrape
ice from the wings and propellers and declined de-icing equipment
at least twice, investigators say.
   The report by the National Transportation Safety Board contained
no conclusions about the cause of the Dec. 26 crash, said author
Eric Sager of the NTSB in Washington.
   ``It's one small part of the investigation,'' Sager said
Thursday in a telephone interview. ``That information may or may
not end up in the report.''
   A final report will be issued in several weeks.
   The United Express plane, en route from Seattle by way of
Yakima, crashed about 400 feet short of the runway at Pasco, about
80 miles south of Yakima. Everyone aboard was killed.
   Ice can slow an airplane or force it down by increasing weight
and drag.
   Sager said he did not think it unusual that the co-pilot and
another United Express employee would be using credit cards to
remove ice from the 19-passenger British Aerospace Jetstream 31
turboprop during the stop in Yakima.
   ``Ice is very frequent,'' Sager said. ``They were attending to
it.''
   The employees were looking at the wings and presumbably felt the
buildup was not enough to warrant the use of de-icing equipment,
Sager said.
   However, a United Express ramp agent in Yakima told
investigators that she was surprised the captain had chosen not to
de-ice. She said most other planes were undergoing the five-minute
procedure that night because it was misting and cold.
   ``She noticed that chips of ice were blown back toward her in
the propeller wash'' as the plane departed, the report said.
   Shelley Swanke, a United Express spokeswoman in Pasco, said
company policy gives pilots the authority to decide when to use
de-icing equipment.
   The report found no medical problems among the crew that might
have contributed to the crash, and no traces of drugs or alcohol.
   United Express is a franchise name used by several airlines
around the country with ties to United Air Lines. The commuter
airline is owned by NPA Inc. of Fresno, Calif.

   Kino, a hard-rock quartet whose name means ``cinema'' in

was not allowed to record by the authorities.
   Kino later received permission to record, and Tsoi became an
idol for many Soviet young people. He recently participated in a
series of successful concerts in Moscow and planned to release a
new album and star in a film.
   In 1987, songs by Kino and three other popular Soviet groups _
Aquarium, Alisa and Strange Games _ were issued in the United

<HEAD>Gorbachev Restores Citizenship of Solzhenitsyn, 22 Others</HEAD>

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has apologized for
two decades of political repression and restored the citizenship of
23 literary, scientific and cultural figures, including Alexander
Solzhenitsyn, officials have said.
   The full list of those deprived of citizenship between 1966-88
and regaining it under the presidential decree will be published
later this month, said Valentin Kulikov, a representative of
Gorbachev's press office.
   The Soviet Media on Thursday published the names of 10 people
whose citizenship was returned, including Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel
laureate charged with treason in 1974.
   They included chess champion Victor Korchnoi; writers Vasily
Aksyonov, Vladimir Voinovich, Lev Kopelev, Georgi Vladimov, and
Valeri Tarsis, who died in exile in 1983; scientists Yuri Orlov and
Valeri Chalidze; and artist Oskar Rabin.
   The names of the other 13 were not included in Wednesday's
presidential decreee. There had been speculation the list would
include Joseph Brodsky, a Nobel Prize-winning writer who emigrated
to the United States in 1972 under threat of imprisonment for his
political comments.
   ``These political repressions were justifiably condemned in this
country and I believe it is now our duty to, if you please, absolve
the (government's) guilt before our countrymen,'' said Gennady
Cheremnykh, head of the citizenship and pardoning department of the
Supreme Soviet's secretariat.
   ``The decree is a conveyance of apologies of sorts. Although it
is belated, it is an apology,'' he said in an interview with the
government daily Izvestia.
   Cheremnykh said 175 Soviets were stripped of their citizenship
from 1966-88. About 60 of them are Armenians who emigrated to the
United States and Canada. The rest are dissidents, he said.
   Under Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Kremlin revoked the citizenship of
prominent authors and artists who spoke out against repression.
Their work was barred from appearing in their homeland.
   Gorbachev continued the practice during his first three years in
office, but then abandoned it.
   In individual decrees, Gorbachev has already restored the
citizenship of many, notably cellist and conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich and his wife, singer Galina Vishnevskaya; dissident
historian Zhores Medvedev; and theater director Yuri Lyubimov. Of
these, only Lyubimov has returned to live in the Soviet Union.
   No conditions were put on the citizens identified Thursday,
Cheremnykh told Izvestia. It was not immediately clear how many
would return.
   Cheremnykh said Solzhenitsyn, who lives with his wife Natalia in
Cavendish, Vermont, had agreed to accept Soviet citizenship, but
the writer's wife, denied that.
   ``Nobody has asked him _ absolutely nobody in any form has
contacted us, not through writing, not through mediation,'' she
said Thursday in an interview from their home.
   Solzhenitsyn, 71, has said he would not return unless all of his
books were published in the Soviet Union and widely available. A
number have been printed, but almost nothing is widely available in
the shortage-plagued Soviet Union.
   Mrs. Solzhenitsyn said that a Soviet court charged her husband
with treason and only a court can lift the charges. Anything else
is ``wielding the same power as Brezhnev did,'' she said, adding
that the expulsion order also must be reversed.
   Solzhenitsyn's ``The Gulag Archipelago'' depicted the horrors of
Stalin's prison camps. His other well-known works include ``One Day
in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward,'' ``August 1914''
and ``The First Circle.''
   He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1970, but in February
1974 was arrested on a treason charge, which carried a possible
death sentence. He was forced onto a plane to Germany and stripped
of his citizenship the next day.
   Korchnoi, 54, said in an interview in Switzerland he welcomed
the restoration of his citizenship as an ``important step,'' but
the grandmaster said he would not return to the Soviet Union.
   Aksyonov, contacted about Gorbachev's decree by the Soviet
Embassy, said from his home in Washington, it was ``the last
hindrance to being accepted officially in Soviet cultural life. I
accept it as a formal apology from the government.'' He said,
however, he would not return to the Soviet Union to live.
   Chalidze, 51, said he was not sure if he would accept the
invitation to be a Soviet citizen again. The decree is ``a
correcting of unjust things that were done in the past,'' he said
from his home in Benson, Vermont, but said: ``I am an American
citizen and about this I am quite happy.''
   Political exiles and Soviets who emigrate to Israel are
automatically stripped of their citizenship.
   Cheremnykh said most of 400,000 Soviets in this category had
left the country voluntarily and indicated there was no chance
their citizenship would be restored.

   Following is a look at 10 of 23 Soviets whose
citizenship has been restored by Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. The names of the 13 others affected by the decree were
not announced.
   _Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 71, author of ``The Gulag
Archipelago,'' a searing expose of the horrors of dictator Josef
Stalin's prison camps. The winner of the Nobel Prize for literature
in 1970, he was charged with treason in 1974, stripped of his
citizenship and expelled. He was constantly harassed by the KGB
secret police and finally was forced onto a plane to Germany and
stripped of his citizenship the next day. ``The Gulag Archipelago''
was published in the Soviet Union last year. Other works include
``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,'' ``Cancer Ward,'' ``The
First Circle'' and ``August 1914,'' a narrative of Russian life and
the nation's stark unpreparedness for the military offensive
launched against Germany in that year.
   _Valeri Chalidze, 51, a founding member of the Human Rights
Committee whose citizenship was revoked while he was on a tour of
the United States in 1972. He wrote, ``To Defend These Rights,
about Human Rights,'' and now runs an emigre publishing house in
Vermont.
   _Lev Kopelev, Solzhenitsyn's prison friend and a scholar of
German literature who left the Soviet Union in November 1980 with
his wife, Raisa Orlova. Both lost their citizenship in 1981 and
moved to West Germany, where Kopelev lives. His wife died last
year. Kopelev's writings include, ``To be Preserved Forever,'' a
restrospective about the Soviet Union, and ``We Lived in Moscow.''
   _Vladimir Voinovich, a satirist who emigrated to West Germany in
1980 after being expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union in 1974.
He was expelled after the publication abroad of his World War II
novel, ``The Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin.'' Other works
include, ``The Ivankiad,'' about an attempt to get an extra room in
a Moscow apartment, ``Moscow 2042,'' a projection of the future,
and ``The Fur Hat,'' a satire on privilege in Soviet society. He
was invited back to the Soviet Union last year for a visit.
   _Victor Korchnoi, 54, one of the Soviet Union's leading chess
players who defected in 1976 in the Netherlands. His matches
against the official Soviet champion, Anatoly Karpov, became famous
as duels on political, psychological and physical levels. He was
twice an unsuccessful challenger of Karpov as titleholder in the
World Championship finals and now ranks 12th worldwide.
   _Georgi Vladimov, 59, one of the leading writers of the magazine
Yunost during the 1960s, he came into conflict with Soviet
authorities over foreign publication of his works. One work is
``Faithful Ruslan,'' a short novel told through the eyes of a guard
dog in a prison camp.
   _Yuri Orlov, a prominent member of the dissident movement, he
was one of the founders of the Helsinki Monitoring Group in Moscow.
Arrested and exiled for his human rights work, he was allowed to
leave for the United States after the Soviets released American
journalist Nick Daniloff.
   _Oskar Rabin, was one of the organizers of a non-conformist art
exhibit in Moscow that was bulldozed in 1974. He was later forced
to emigrate.
   _Vasily Aksyonov, author of the 1960 bestseller ``Kollegi,'' was
criticized by Soviet authorities for his ``bad language,'' which
actually was the slang of Soviet youth. He emigrated after a brush
with the authorities in 1980. Other works include ``The Burn,''
about a young boy who grew up in Moscow and in Stalin's labor
camps, the satirical novel ``The Island of Crimea,'' and ``In
Search of Melancholy Baby,'' about his emigre life. He made his
first trip back to the Soviet Union last year and plans another
when his play ``Heron'' is produced in Moscow next year.
   _Valeri Tarsis, who was awarded citizenship posthumously, was a
correspondent during World War II and a short-story writer. He
demanded permission to emigrate in 1961, was detained in a
psychiatric hospital under Nikita S. Khrushchev, and expelled from
the Soviet Union in the late 1960s. He died in Switzerland in 1983.

   Retired Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who took
power after a 1982 military coup but was overthrown a year later,
has signed up as a presidential candidate in a November election.
   His action Thursday conflicts with Supreme Court and
congressional rulings that he is ineligible to run because of the
military coup.
   Rios Montt, a born-again Christian who as military ruler sent
more than a dozen convicted leftists before the firing squads, is
campaigning as a law-and-order candidate.
   Human rights workers and others are worried that Rios Montt's
eye-for-an-eye brand of justice will lead to further human rights
abuses in a country already plagued with them. Polls show him among
the leading contenders to replace President Vinicio Cerezo.
   Rios Montt took power after the coup ousted Gen. Romeo Lucas
Garcia on March 23, 1982. Rios Montt, in turn, was removed by Gen.
Oscar Humberto Mejia Victores on Aug. 8, 1983.
   The Supreme Court, in a non-binding opinion sought by Congress
last year, said Rios Montt cannot be president or vice president
because of a constitutional ban on the holding of those posts by
people who assumed power in a coup.
   Last month, the Association of National Dignitaries, made up of
people who drew up the current constitution, arrived at the same
conclusion.
   Rios Montt is running with the backing of three of Guatemala's
19 registered parties.
   Nine candidates have signed up for the presidency, including
Jorge Carpio Nicolle, a journalist defeated five years ago by
Cerezo.
   There will be a runoff on Jan. 6 if no candidate wins a majority
in the Nov. 11 election.
   If Guatemala's elections registry refuses to accept his
candidacy, Rios Montt can appeal through the court system.

   Setting out on his
sixth term in office, President Joaquin Balaguer has asked
Dominicans to cooperate with an austerity plan that touched off
deadly protests this week.
   Balaguer, 83 and blind from glaucoma, defended his austerity
plan during the ceremony Thursday.
   ``As I assume another term, I am obligated not to make promises,
but to point out the changes that are needed to make the government
work,'' the conservative president said in his inaugural address.
   The nationwide strike Monday and Tuesday brought this Caribbean
nation of 7 million people to a near-standstill. Clashes between
protesters and security forces left at least 11 dead and 50
wounded. Police arrested 2,000 protesters.
   Balaguer narrowly defeated his longtime leftist rival, Juan
Bosch, in an election May 16. Bosch, 81, who accused Balaguer of
widespread voter fraud, did not attend the inauguration.
   Nine major unions organized the 48-hour strike this week to
protest against sharply higher consumer prices caused by the
government last week. The austerity program is intended to bolster
the country's ailing economy.
   Under the program recommended by the International Monetary
Fund, the government cut subsidies and sharply increased prices for
basic goods such as gasoline, flour and sugar.
   The government estimates the annual inflation rate at 50
percent, but some officials privately say it is about 70 percent.
   In his speech, Balaguer did not mention the protests
specifically but said his economic policies were intended ``to
improve the quality of life of the poor'' and ``to diminish or
completely eliminate inflation.''
   ``I ask for help and cooperation from all men and women of good
will in this country because the task we will have in the next four
years will be arduous,'' he said.
   Balaguer is beginning his second consecutive four-year term and
his sixth over the past 30 years. He is founder and leader of
conservative Social Christian Reformist Party.
   The president is also a lawyer and author of about 20 books.
   In his last term, Balaguer embarked on an ambitious $2 billion
public works program that has been mostly financed by printing
money. The construction project _ much of it timed for completion
in 1992 to coincide with the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
discovery of America _ created hundreds of jobs but worsened
inflation.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Pay Tribute to Fallen Dictator</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Pakistanis,
reeling from 20 turbulent months of democracy, streamed today to
the grave of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq's to pay tribute to the
fallen dictator on the second anniversary of his death.
   Mourners traveled by foot, cart and bus to the giant Faisal
Mosque to offer prayers for Zia, who died Aug. 17, 1988, in a
mysterious plane crash. All 37 people aboard, including several top
generals and U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphel, were killed.
   Zia's son, Ijaz ul-Haq, placed wreaths at the graves of the
other generals today and then led a huge procession to the Faisal
Mosque from the neighboring city of Rawalpindi, the headquarters of
the army that has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 43-year
history.
   Mourners planned to offer prayers for Zia later today to mark
the time his plane crashed in a desert in eastern Punjab province.
Ijaz was to offer a tribute, using the occasion to launch his own
political career.
   Zia's death anniversary comes less than two weeks after former
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed on charges
of corruption, nepotism and ineptitude.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose father was overthrown by Zia in 1977, claims a
similar coup was staged against her but camouflaged by the
constitution.
   Her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was hanged in 1979 on charges
of conspiring the murder a political enemy who was never killed.
She blames Zia.
   While in power Ms. Bhutto proclaimed her father a martyr for
democracy. Ijaz says his father was a martyr for Islam.
   Six-foot posters of the former military ruler line the wide
boulevards of the capital. Giant banners proclaiming Zia a martyr
flutter in the warm summer breeze.
   With the future of democracy uncertain, many Pakistanis are
fondly remembering Zia as a humble, compassionate man and
reminiscing about military rule.
   Hundreds of people make the pilgrimage to Zia's grave daily.
   Ijaz, a 38-year-old banker on the verge of running for office,
insists that his father was a good model for a candidate.
   ``Benazir Bhutto's father was a civilian dictator and she came
to power. Why can't the son of Zia ul-Haq?'' asked Ijaz.
   Elections are scheduled for Oct. 24, but speculation is rife
that they will be postponed and that another round of military rule
is inevitable.
   A four-foot framed picture of the former dictator dominates
Ijaz's living room. Propped up at its side is a smaller picture of
Zia, one hand on his heart, in front of the White House with former
President Reagan, striking a similar pose.
   Zia's Hercules C-130 had been in the air less than five minutes
when it weaved out of control and nosedived into the ground,
according to witnesses.
   A technical report charged sabotage, but a criminal
investigation was never pursued. Ms. Bhutto's government made a
weak attempt at probing the crash and the U.S. government waited a
year before sending investigators.
   Ijaz blames Al-Zulfikar, a group led by Ms. Bhutto's brother,
Murtaza. It hijacked a plane in the mid-1980s, and Zia had said
they were behind several failed assassination attempts.
   Ijaz also claims President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, the army and the
United States staged a coverup.

<HEAD>Aquino Murder Trial Ends But Still No Verdict</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The trial of 40 soldiers and
civilians accused in the 1983 murder of President Corazon Aquino's
husband ended today, but a verdict could take another year, a court
official said.
   Former Sen. Benigno Aquino was assassinated Aug. 21, 1983 as he
stepped from a plane at the Manila airport. He was returning from
self-imposed exile in the United States to lead the opposition
against the late President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Marcos alleged that Aquino was killed by a Communist assassin,
Rolando Galman, who soldiers shot dead on the tarmac. Prosecutors
argued Galman was part of a military conspiracy and that a soldier
actually killed Aquino.
   Prosecutors today asked the court to render a guilty verdict
``with the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and
treachery'' and taking advantage of their government positions.
   Aquino's slaying sparked massive protests that swept his widow
to the presidency in February 1986 after a ``People Power'' revolt
ousted Marcos and drove him to exile in the United States. Marcos
died in Hawaii in September 1989.
   Under Mrs. Aquino's administration, the Supreme Court overturned
a December 1985 acquittal of former Chief of Staff Fabian Ver, 24
soldiers and one civilian after the court found evidence that
Marcos engineered the decision. Ver fled the country during the
1986 uprising.
   In April 1987, government prosecutors indicted 40 people for the
murder of Aquino and Galman. The case was filed with the
Sandiganbayan court, which tries state employees charged with civil
and criminal suits.
   The 40 included Ver, two generals, 33 soldiers and four
civilians, including former Tourism Minister Jose Aspiras, now a
member of the House of Representatives, who was an alleged
accomplice.
   Also charged as accomplices were former information minister
Gregorio Cendana and former air and former transport minister Jesus
Singson.
   The 3{-year-long trial culminated today after defense lawyers
and prosecutors submitted summaries of their arguments to the
three-member court.
   Clerk of Court Dolores Balajadia said that under Philippine law,
the panel of judges has up to one year to make a final ruling.
There are no juries in the Philippines, where a verdict is the
responsibility of judges.
   During the trial, the court saw photographs, tape recordings and
video footage of the seconds before and after Aquino slumped dead
on the tarmac with a single bullet wound in the back of the head.
   It also heard the testimony of 51 defense and 79 prosecution
witnesses, including four who claimed they saw a soldier kill
Aquino.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
investigating complaints against a public TV station for showing
some of Robert Mapplethorpe's most sexually explicit photos.
   WGBH showed the pictures in a 10 p.m. news broadcast July 31,
the day before the opening here of an exhibit of the late artist's
work, which includes homosexual and sadomasochistic images and
child nudes.
   The FCC has not decided whether to take any action against the
station, said Roger Holberg, an FCC attorney.
   The traveling exhibit, now on display at the Institute of
Contemporary Art, has generated a storm of protests since it became
a focus of Sen. Jesse Helms' crusade against federal funding of art
deemed indecent.
   Later, the director of a Cincinnati gallery that exhibited the
photographs was arrested on obscenity charges. He is awaiting trial.
   Leading the list of three complaints to the FCC was one by the
Rev. Donald Wildmon, head of the American Family Association in
Tupelo, Miss.
   A letter from Wildmon, a longtime critic of alleged indeceny in
media, described the broadcast as ``nothing more than the
sensational presentation of potentially obscene material.''
   Eric Brass, attorney for WGBH, defended the broadcast.
   ``It just is not obscene,'' Brass said Thursday. ``I believe we
have the right to do what we did in the context of a serious news
program. We cannot be in the position of censoring debate about
censorship.''
   If material is judged to be obscene, it can be banned from being
broadcast, Holberg said. But material deemed to be indecent is
given more leeway as long as it is not shown before 8 p.m., when
children are more likely to be watching.
   Congress told the agency last year to restrict broadcasting of
indecent material 24 hours a day. The new rule was challenged by
broadcasters and other groups, and a federal appeals court in
Washington is studying whether it can be enforced.
   Mapplethorpe put together the exhibit shortly before he died of
AIDS last year at age 42. The 124 photographs are mainly portraits
and pictures of flowers, but about a quarter of them are sexually
graphic.
   ``We wanted to let the public know what the controversy was
about and let them decide for themselves,'' said Julie Eggleston, a
spokeswoman for the TV station. WGBH, as a part of the Public
Broadcasting Service, receives federal funds.

<TEXT>
   A century after the Prince of Wales'
tailor invented the tail-less dinner jacket, Saratoga Springs and
Tuxedo Park are rolling up the sleeves of their pleated-front
shirts over which town introduced the tux to America.
   Ed Hotaling, a part-time columnist for The Saratogian, stirred
things up by suggesting that tuxedos be renamed ``saratogas.'' He
contends the English creation made its debut in his summer resort
hometown in upstate New York in the late 1880s.
   The exclusive community of Tuxedo Park, 40 miles northwest of
New York City, says the origin is in its name.
   Tuxedo Park Mayor Cornelius J.J. Madera Jr. said Hotaling's
claim, like Saratoga's famous racetrack, smells of horses.
``They're spending too much time in the barns,'' he said.
   Hotaling, who began his campaign nine months ago, wrote
Wednesday of a day when ``all waiters will look down at you in
their saratogas. Invitations to parties will note the required
men's wear in tiny letters: `saratoga.' ''
   Hotaling claimed the semiformal evening jacket was first worn to
a ball in Saratoga Springs' Grand Union Hotel by local playboy E.
Berry Wall. He cites as his source the social historian George
Waller, author of ``Saratoga: Saga of an Impious Era.''
   But Tuxedo Park historian Albert F. Winslow said a more likely
story is that one of Tuxedo Park's founders, James Brown Potter,
brought the tuxedo back from England.
   The jacket was later picked up by Griswold Lorillard, son of one
of the founders of Tuxedo Park, who wore a formal jacket with the
tails cut off to a ball in 1886, Winslow said.
   ``You get a couple of department stores selling saratogas _
you'll get a change,'' growled Hotaling, who is also a producer for
ABC News in Washington.
   But it's unlikely the dinner jacket will undergo a name change
anytime soon.
   ``I just couldn't imagine it happening when a name's so
entrenched in people's minds,'' said Nick Valentine, owner of
Broadway Tailors in Newburgh. ``If you say tuxedo, you mean formal

   Tokyo stock prices plunged today as hopes
diminished for a swift settlement of the Middle East crisis, while
the dollar drifted lower against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 762.72 points, or 2.77
percent, to 26,786.72 points by the close of the week's trading.
Estimated volume was 300 million shares.
   Traders said many investors were disappointed with the outcome
of the meeting between President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein at
Bush's summer retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Optimism swept the market Wednesday on rumors that Hussein was
carrying a letter containing a peace proposal from Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein, boosting the Nikkei average over 1,400 points.
   Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor Kuwait on Aug. 2. Iraq
continues to control the territory, while the United States and
other countries have begun ferrying troops to Saudi Arabia to guard
against an Iraqi takeover of the world's largest oil reserves.
   Tokyo markets at first followed New York's downward trend in
overnight trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
fell 66.83 to 2,681.44, its lowest close since the crisis began.
   Traders said that uncertainty over how events in the Middle East
might change over the weekend depressed trading, and arbitrage
traders were active in the falling market.
   Cheaper bonds also played a role, according to Kazuhiro Nomura,
of the New Japan Securities Co.
   Brent Crude for October delivery continued to climb, meanwhile.
It was valued at about $26.10-$26.20 a barrel in Tokyo this
afternoon, up from the previous evenings price in New York of
$26.00-$26.05 a barrel.
   In currency trading, the dollar closed at 147.35 yen. Trading
moved between a low of 147.35 yen and a high of 148.10 yen.
   With the United States facing long-term economic problems, and
Japan's economy relatively stronger in the short term, traders
predicted that the dollar would remain in the 147-148 yen range.
   Although the dollar normally gains strength in times of crisis,
the structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy have overwhelmed the
dollar, traders said.
   ``The yen has strengthened a little,'' said Robert A. Feldman of
Solomon Brothers Asia.
   On the bond market, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 8.050 percent, up from
Thursday's close of 7.985 percent. Its price fell to 83.24 points
from 83.52 points the previous day.

   Businessman Michael Saba was lucky enough
to flee Iraq after it invaded Kuwait. Now he wants to help
Americans trapped there and their worried families in the United
States.
   Saba, who took a taxi from Baghdad to the Jordanian border on
Aug. 8, formed the Coming Home Committee to gather information,
raise money and prepare emergency transportation to get other
Americans out of the Middle East.
   By Thursday, after appearances on TV talk shows, Saba said he
had heard from about 50 people who escaped the region and from a
similar number of frantic family members.
   ``A lot of them I'm talking to, if not hysterical, are close to
it,'' said Saba, president of GulfAmerica International Business
Services.
   When he got out of Iraq, Saba brought news to the families of 11
oil workers he spoke with that they were all right.
   Now he's gathering information on Americans in the Persian Gulf
for a computer record, overseeing preliminary exit arrangements and
organizing hoped-for charter air service and ground vehicles to
reunite families faster.
   ``There have been windows of opportunity to leave,'' he said.
``If they open again, we better be ready to get them out.''
   Saba also has served as a sounding board and shoulder to cry on
for anxious relatives.
   ``I'm desperate,'' said Anna Morel of Waukegan. ``I'll go to any
source I think can help,''
   Mrs. Morel's daughter, Faith Abedin, was working in Kuwait as an
English teacher when Iraq invaded early this month. She lost
contact after the invasion.
   ``Michael Saba knows the people, the culture, the traditions.
He's probably more in tune with them than anybody in Washington,''
said Mrs. Morel, who talked with Saba after seeing him on
television.
   She said that Saba assured her the Iraqi soldiers ``are not as
bad as we've heard,'' and that he took information about her
daughter, son-in-law, and their two children, ages 4 and 5.
   Saba, whose company promotes trade between the U.S. and Arab
nations, said he worries that an outbreak of fighting might prevent
trapped Americans from getting out.
   ``To put the value of a barrel of oil over a human life is
frightening,'' said Saba. ``Let's re-orient people on what our real
values should be.''
   Mrs. Morel had similar fears.
   ``Our government is caught up in a big showdown and I'm afraid
our people will be caught in the cross-fire, sacrificed,'' she said.

   The state coffers are $86,000 richer thanks to a
concert Elvis Presley never gave.
   As an estimated 8,000 fans attended a candlelight vigil in
Memphis, Tenn., to mark Presley's death 13 years ago Thursday, a
New York judge ruled that Presley's estate could not claim proceeds
from a concert he was due to perform at the Nassau County Coliseum
on Long Island on Aug. 22, 1977.
   Presley died six days earlier. While refunds were offered, many
Presley fans held on to their tickets, leaving $86,000 in limbo.
   State Supreme Court Justice Eli Wager ruled that unclaimed
proceeds of the concert belonged to the state, said Leslie Gersing,
a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office. The money,
she said, will go into the state's Abandoned Property Fund.
   Anyone who decides now that they want a refund can get it
through the fund, Gersing said.
   Presley died at Graceland, mansion in Memphis, at age 42. A
medical examiner listed the cause of death as heart disease, but
court testimony revealed Presley was addicted to prescription drugs.

   Wreckage of an Army convoy truck that
overturned on a highway and spilled munitions bound for the Middle
East was cleared today amid reports that Stinger anti-aircraft
missiles fell onto the roadway.
   Army officials said the vehicle that crashed on Interstate 95
was part of a convoy that left nearby Fort Stewart headed for docks
near Savannah on Thursday night, fort spokesman Maj. Don Keeling
said.
   Keeling refused to describe the types of munitions that spilled.
   Georgia State Patrol spokesman J.D. Coleman said the Department
of Defense asked civilian authorities to block off both sides of
the road and create a safe area about 1,000-feet-wide while
awaiting explosives experts.
   WSAV-TV in Savannah quoted an unidentified Chatham County
sheriff's department dispatcher as saying the vehicle carried
Stinger missiles.
   The Savannah Morning News quoted an unidentified police officer
as saying he was told by Army personnel that as many as four
Stinger missiles were trapped underneath the vehicle.
   The munitions were packaged and ``at no time was there any
danger of detonation,'' Keeling said. The wreckage was cleared
early this morning by the Army and the highway was reopened, state
patrol officials said.
   A soldier aboard the truck that crashed was treated at a
hospital for a hand injury, officials said.
   Army officials said they have not determined the cause of the
accident about 10 miles southwest of Savannah.
   The convoy was carrying equipment from the 24th Infantry
(Mechanized) Division to load onto military ships destined for to
Saudi Arabia as part of the U.S. response to the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, the Army said.

   The dollar fell sharply in Europe late this
morning and was trading at a record low in Frankfurt as markets
focused on the weakness of the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices rose $7 an ounce in London and $8.75 in Zurich on
the dollar's weakness and tensions in the Gulf.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was pushed down by a
growing market conviction that the U.S. economy will show
increasing signs of weakness in the coming months.
   Traders said these considerations would overshadow any factors
that could push the dollar higher.
   They said U.S. trade figures for June, to be released later
today, could only push the dollar lower.
   The dollar was trading at 1.5528 marks late this morning, down
from 1.5630 marks late Thursday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 147.35 yen, down from 147.90 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted higher at 147.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.5528 West German marks, down from 1.5630
   _1.2865 Swiss francs, down from 1.3025
   _5.2140 French francs, down from 5.2495
   _1.7480 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7610
   _1,144.50 Italian lire, down from 1,149.75
   _1.1478 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1477
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.9135, compared with $1.8985 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.75 a troy ounce and
dealers later fixed a recommended price of $410.50. Both were
sharply higher than Thursday's late bid price of $403.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $410.00, up from $401.25 late
Thursday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $9.95 to close at a bid $410.96. Silver
rose in London to a bid price of $5.23 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.13.

   Israeli troops killed two guerrillas today in

   The guerrillas were detected by a patrol two miles west of the
town of Tayibah, which is three miles from the northern Israeli
border, said an army spokeswoman. She cannot be identified by name
under military regulations.
   The army did not say if the guerrillas were Palestinian or
Lebanese, nor was there immediate elaboration on the circumstances
of the killings.
   About 1,500 Israeli troops along with 3,000 Israeli-backed
Lebanese militiamen regularly patrol Israel's self-declared

   The 2- to 10-mile-deep zone was carved out by Israel in 1985
when it withdrew the bulk of its troops after Israel's 1982
invasion.

   Iraq today began freeing Iranian
prisoners of war and withdrawing troops from Iranian territory in
an effort to settle one conflict while it faces growing world
pressure over its occupation of Kuwait.
   Iran announced it also was freeing Iraqi POWs today to
reciprocate for Baghdad's peace initiative, but it did not disclose
their number.
   The first batch of freed Iranian POWs arrived in Qasr-E-Shirin,
an Iranian border town decorated with the green Islamic Republic
flag, portraits of the late Ayatollah Rughollah Khomeini and
colorful ribbons.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did
not say how many prisoners had arrived in Qasr-E-Shirin. But
Baghdad and the International Committee of the Red Cross have said
1,000 Iranians were to be freed today.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday offered to release
Iranians captured in the eight-year war that ended in cease-fire in
August 1988. Peace talks have bogged down since then, but Saddam's
initiative could speed the process.
   Saddam also said he hoped to complete within five days the
withdrawal from Iraqi-occupied territory in Iran.
   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and massed troops along that
country's border with Saudi Arabia, faces a U.S. and Arab troop
buildup in the Saudi desert and a growing world trade embargo.
   Neutralizing the Iraq's 633-mile eastern border with Iran,
Iraq's longest frontier, frees an estimated 300,000 Iraqi troops
who could be sent to Kuwait to face the military buildup in Saudi
Arabia.
   The Red Cross has registered 19,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq and
50,000 Iraqis in Iran but estimates both sides actually hold a
total of more than 100,000.
   Iran says Iraq occupies more than 770 square miles of its
territory. But the United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half that amount.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, which
has been asked by Iraq to supervise the repatriation, said 1,000
was the maximum number its Baghdad delegation of 19 members could
handle.
   Under the Geneva Convention, the delegates must make sure, in
individual interviews, that no prisoner is sent home against his
will.
   ``There have been no problems so far,'' Red Cross spokeswoman
Martine Haemmerli said in Geneva.
   Inmates of an Iraqi camp at Mosul, near the Turkish border, were
to make up the first release, and delegates began interviewing them
Thursday.
   The Red Cross has said experience gained in the first phase is
hoped to allow stepping up the pace to an eventual 2,000 daily. An
increase of the Baghdad delegation is under review but no decision
has yet been taken.
   Saddam made his peace initiatives in a letter to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani. In the message, he also accepted
Iran's demand that a settlement of the border dispute be based on a
1975 demarcation treaty.
   Saddam had rejected the 1975 agreement, which divided the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway between them. He wanted sovereignty over the
channel, a confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates that is a
major Iraqi outlet to the gulf.
   Iranian officials on Thursday welcomed Saddam's offer, but
Rafsanjani said developments on the Iran-Iraq front were separate
from the crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We hold on to our view that Iraq must evacuate (its forces)
from the Kuwaiti territory to create the necessary conditions for
reestablishment of peace and tranquility,'' Iran's official news
agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying.

   Nina Bara, who portrayed the reformed
villainess Tonga on television's ``Space Patrol'' series in the
1950s, has died at age 70.
   Bara died Wednesday of cancer at Glendale Adventist Medical
Center, said her husband, Ray Linke.
   As Tonga, Bara served on Commander Buzz Corey's crew in the
low-budget predecessor to ``Star Trek.'' The ABC-TV series ran from
1950 to 1955.
   Miss Bara also appeared in the films ``Visa'' and ``Carnival in

   Linke said his wife left acting in the 1960s and studied library
science, serving as a librarian at Blue Cross of Southern
California until she retired in 1985, Linke said.
   Born in Argentina to an American father and an Italian mother,
Miss Bara spoke fluent Spanish and was heard on radio programs in a

   A British fighter jet crashed into the North Sea
during a training flight and the two crewmen were missing and
presumed dead, the Defense Ministry reported today.
   Rescuers abandoned an air and sea search for the crew after the
wreckage was discovered this morning.
   ``We've found the wreckage of the aircraft just a couple of
miles away from the point the radar signals indicated last night,''
said a spokesman at the Royal Air Force rescue coordination center
at Pitreavie, near Edinburgh, who by custom was not identified.
   ``From the evidence we have got at the moment it does not look
as though there are any survivors,'' he added.
   The plane came down Thursday off Spurn Head on the northeast
English coast.
   On Tuesday, two RAF Tornados collided three miles from the same
site, killing a U.S. Air Force pilot on a training mission and two
RAF crewmen.
   The Defense Ministry said in a statement that the cause of
Thursday's crash, which involved only one plane, was not known.
   It said the plane suddenly disappeared from radar screens. It
gave no distress call before crashing.

<HEAD>Sailors Who Publicly Questioned Ship Safety to Be Reassigned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four sailors have lost their clearance to work
on nuclear ships because they publicly questioned nuclear reactor
program safety on the aircraft carrier Nimitz instead of telling
superiors, Navy officials said.
   The sailors have been temporarily assigned to the ship's
engineering department, received pay cuts, and will eventually be
assigned to another post because the Navy no longer trusts them to
work around reactors, Navy spokesman Cmdr. Bob Pritchard said
Thursday.
   ``The commanding officer lost confidence in their ability to
perform,'' Pritchard said. ``They would be made available for
reassignment to another ship or installation, depending on their
qualifications.''
   But family members awaiting the Nimitz's arrival today at North
Island Naval Air Station contend the Navy made scapegoats of the
men without adequately investigating their complaints.
   ``There are too many questions they don't want answered. I
wonder what the Navy is afraid of,'' said Rima Puma, the mother of
machinist mate second class Steven Puma.
   Puma and three shipmates told a Seattle television station Aug.
2 that crew members cheated on exams to compensate for their
inadequate training, that test results for radiation leaks were
fabricated and that faulty hardware was installed on the Nimitz,
based in Bremerton, Wash.
   The four also threatened to sabotage the vessel's reactors to
draw attention to their complaints. The names of the other three
sailors have not been released.
   A joint investigation by several naval agencies ``found no
evidence to support the allegations made and concluded that the
ship's reactors are safe and that the crew is qualified to operate
them,'' Pritchard said.
   But the probe did reveal that some sailors cheated on exams that
covered their technical knowledge of the Nimitz's nuclear reactor
procedures.
   ``A handful of guys admitted they looked on their buddies' test
paper during one exam,'' Pritchard said. ``However, there was no
finding that would call into question the qualification and
capability of the crew to operate the propulsion plant safely.''
   Nimitz Capt. Robert C. Williamson ordered the four sailors into
protective custody as the ship was leaving its home port. They were
released Aug. 8 after the ship sailed, Pritchard said.
   The crewmen received a verbal reprimand from Williamson while at
sea. The skipper later revoked their nuclear credentials,
prohibiting them from working on any of the Navy's nuclear-powered
ships. The demotion also reduces the sailors' merit pay for
enlisting in the Navy's nuclear program.
   Officials said the crewmen were disciplined because they did not
use military hot lines to air their concerns or take their
complaints to supervising officers.

   Take a hike, Saddam Hussein.
   The Metropolitan Transit Commission is counting on public
distaste for the Iraqi president to boost ridership on city buses
and encourage car pooling.
   Saddam's picture and the words, ``Stop pumping him up,''
appeared in newspaper advertisements in the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press Thursday.
   The commission has had an advertising campaign since last spring
encouraging Twin Citians to conserve energy by taking the bus and
sharing rides.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and gasoline and oil prices
began to rise, the wheels started turning at Grant &amp; Palombo, an
advertising agency.
   ``It's an opportunistic message that happens to tie into the
campaign we have in place for the MTC,'' said John Palombo, the ad
agency's chief executive officer.
   Below a head shot of Saddam, the ad reads, ``It's about time we
showed this guy we don't need his oil. Take the bus or rideshare
and you do just that.''
   Phones at MTC headquarters were busier than usual Thursday, with
callers asking for bus and car pooling information in reaction to
the ads, commission officials said.
   ``People see it as a way of venting the frustration everyone
seems to be feeling,'' Palombo said.
   It's too soon to tell if Iraq's invasion and rising gasoline
prices are boosting ridership, but there are encouraging signs,
said Todd Melby, MTC communications coordinator.
   A comparison of revenues for the first two weeks of this month
and the same period in August 1989 shows revenues are even with
last year's. That's good news, because revenues had been down this
year.
   ``So we're actually saying we're up 2 percent,'' Melby said.

   Saudi Arabia today turned away an Iraqi
tanker seeking to break the embargo on Iraqi oil shipments, Persian
Gulf shipping sources said.
   The tanker, identified as the 80,000-ton Al-Fao, arrived off the
Saudi Arabian Red Sea terminal of Yanbu early this morning, but
Saudi tugboats refused to pilot it into port, the sources said.
   The tanker sailed away in the early afternoon toward
international waters where another Iraqi tanker, Al-Qadissiyah,
anchored after it was turned away Monday, said the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Al-Qadissiyah's arrival marked the first Iraqi attempt to
break the embargo via the trans-Saudi Arabian pipeline.
   The pipeline has a capacity of 1.65 million barrels per day, and
operated by Saudi Arabia's giant oil firm, Saudi Aramco.
   Iraq pumped crude oil through the pipeline at reduced capacity
after the U.N. Security Council sanctions were imposed.
   By Monday, it had filled the storage capacity of about 10 to 11
million barrels. Pumping has since halted.
   Iraqi oil exports were choked off under U.N. sanctions imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and its annexation of
the emirate six days later.

<TEXT>
   A billboard criticizing Sen. Jesse
Helms and arts censorship was taken down a week after it went up
because the poster violates the billboard company's ban on
controversial signs.
   The billboard, created by Los Angeles artist Robbie Conal,
depicted the Republican from North Carolina with copy that read:
``Artificial Art Official.''
   Helms, who has opposed National Endowment for the Arts grants to
artists with sexual or other controversial themes, was depicted
with a hole in his head in the center of a painter's palette.
   ``This is exactly an example of the issue I was trying to
protest,'' Conal said. ``I'm saddened but I can't say that I'm
shocked. I want the billboard back. I hope some billboard company
still believes in the First Amendment.''
   Conal said he signed a three-month lease for the billboard on
heavily traveled Santa Monica Boulevard. The billboard, roughly 18
feet by 48 feet, was unveiled Aug. 8.
   A telephone message left with Helms' office in Washington was
not returned.
   The billboard structure is owned by National Advertising, a
subsidiary of Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing.
   The billboard unit has a policy prohibiting controversial
subjects such as abortion, sex and birth control, said 3M spokesman
Ken Froslid. He said the Helms billboard contained ``questionable
copy.''
   The decision to tear down the billboard was made by a national
marketing director for National Advertising in Chicago, he said.
   ``Jesse Helms did not contact us or any of his people,'' Froslid
said. ``It was strictly an internal decision.''

<HEAD>Justice Department Investigating Allegations Against Nazi-Hunting
Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is investigating
allegations that its Nazi-hunting unit withheld evidence on a
former California resident convicted of war crimes by a Yugoslav
court, according to a published report today.
   The department's Office of Professional Responsibility is
conducting the investigation into the case of Andrija Artukovic,
the Los Angeles Times quoted unidentified sources as saying.
   One official familiar with the probe said there was no evidence
Artukovic was falsely convicted of ordering the deaths of hundreds
of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies during World War II, the newspaper said.
   Artukovic served as a Cabinet minister in a Nazi puppet
government in wartime Croatia that executed thousands. He emigrated
to the United States in 1948 under an alias and resided in Seal
Beach before he was identified and extradited to Yugoslavia in
1986. Two years later, he died at age 88 in a Yugoslav prison.
   Artukovic's son, Radoslav, alleges that the Nazi-hunting unit,
the Office of Special Investigations, withheld evidence that might
have cast doubt on two witnesses whose testimony was used against
his father during extradition proceedings.
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett declined to comment on
the allegations and the investigation.
   Radoslav Artukovic said he had obtained conflicting affidavits
by witnesses against his father and alleged that Office of
Professional Responsibility officials withheld those less favorable
to their case, the Times said.
   According to one affidavit, a former Serbian police chief,
Fronjo Truhar, testified in 1952 that during the war, Artukovic had
ordered an imprisoned lawyer to be killed. The execution was
carried out in July 1941, Truhar said.
   But in a 1951 affidavit, Truhar never mentioned Artukovic's
alleged order to execute the lawyer. That affidavit allegedly was
not used as evidence at the extradition hearings, the Times said.
   Radoslav Artukovic obtained documents that contradict an
affidavit obtained in 1984 from Bajro Avdic, who claimed he served
as a motorcycle escort for Artukovic in 1941, the Times said.
   Avdic claimed he saw Artukovic order soldiers to massacre
innocent civilians. But Radoslav Artukovic said the man had
submitted three previous statements dating back to 1946 that
differed substantially in details and recollections.
   ``He changed his story each time he told it,'' the younger
Artukovic said.
   In addition, Radoslav Artukovic alleges it was the Office of
Professional Responsibility, not Yugoslav officials, that initiated
extradition proceedings against his father.
   Neal M. Sher, director of the Office of Special Investigations,
has denied the allegation and said the Justice Department merely
cooperated with a request by Yugoslav officials, the Times said.

   Iraq today reduced the curfew in major
cities in occupied Kuwait to seven hours a night, Iraqi media said.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said President Saddam Hussein's
office ordered an 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in Jahra, Nida' and
Kuwait City.
   Iraqi authorities first clamped a 24-hour curfew on the cities
after their Aug. 2 invasion, then reduced it to 12 hours from 7
p.m. to 7 a.m.
   Recent refugees from Kuwait said no one was circulating at night
in any case, as Iraqi soldiers were cracking down on scattered acts
of resistance.
   The reduced curfew appeared to indicate they were succeeding.
   Refugees who escaped from Kuwait earlier this week said the city
crackled with gunfire when darkness fell as Kuwaitis staged
hit-and-run raids against the invaders. They said the Iraqis have
still not been able to stamp out resistance by citizens of the
small oil-rich state.
   But some said the Kuwaiti underground is waiting for help from
outside before launching a real offensive against the conquerors.
   ``When the sun shines you're gripped with the awesome silence
and desolation, and after sundown there's the fear of violence and
death,'' said one Kuwaiti, Saeed Hussein.
   ``Resistance has been reactivated, but only after dark,'' he
added.
   A Kuwaiti woman, who declined to be identified, said some
Kuwaiti men ``go out with machine guns every night and kill one or
two Iraqis.''
   There has been no independent confirmation of any significant
resistance in the northern Persian Gulf state, and the extent of
casualties in what clashes there may be is not known.
Communications with Kuwait are still cut.
   Iraq has an estimated 120,000 troops in Kuwait.
   A growing U.S. force _ backed by an international fleet drawn
from the British, French and other navies _ is mustering in Saudi
Arabia to face the Iraqis massed along the kingdom's northern
border.
   Kuwait's radio station, once the liveliest in the Persian Gulf
region, broadcasts clandestinely, calling for resistance against
the Iraqi invaders.
   ``Kuwait will ... never be part of Iraq,'' announcers stress in
between nationalist songs.
   ``Today brave Kuwaitis in a speeding car hurled a grenade at a
security base, killing a number of Iraqi soldiers and injuring
others,'' it claimed in a broadcast Wednesday.
   Another traveler from Kuwait, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said: ``Resistance is spreading ... Young Kuwaitis don't
know mercy any more.
   ``The slogan `kill an Iraqi and gain a dinar' is written on
school buildings and everywhere, even on the sidealks and the
tarmac of the streets,'' he reported.

   Fears for about three dozen Americans detained in Baghdad
intensified today amid word they had been moved to an undisclosed
location, and Saudi Arabia reportedly turned away an Iraqi tanker
trying to break the oil embargo.
   As the Persian Gulf crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of its
neighbor Kuwait entered its third week, officials in Washington
said U.S. officials in the Iraqi capital were demanding access to
the detainees.
   ``We understand the 35 Americans who were in the Rashid Hotel
have been moved. We think we know where they are, but we have not
seen them,'' a source at the State Department said today.
   President Bush also said there were reports ``about moving 30
Americans someplace'' from the luxury hotel where they had been
confined in the Iraqi capital. But the president, vacationing in
Kennebunkport, Maine, provided no details in his brief comments to
reporters today.
   Iraq, seeking peace with its old enemy Iran in order to focus on
the escalating confrontation with the United States, today began
withdrawing troops from Iranian territory and freeing Iranian POWs.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was bound for Riyadh today to
visit American troops standing guard in the Saudi desert against a
possible further thrust by Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. Bush
expressed pessimism Thursday that Iraqi forces would end their
occupation of Kuwait.
   In the Persian Gulf, the military buildup and economic embargo
intensified, but American efforts to squeeze Iraq with a trade
embargo could run into trouble. The United Nations chief said
military enforcement of U.N. sanctions against Iraq requires U.N.
approval.
   A special Security Council committee on the embargo was to meet
privately today, and Canadian diplomats said they intended to
discuss how the committee would monitor compliance beyond official
government statements.
   Bush has ordered U.S. naval commanders to use ``the minimum
force necessary'' to interdict shipments to and from Iraq. That
could include firing across the bow to halt a ship.
   Gulf-based shipping executives today reported that Saudi
authorities refused to permit an Iraqi tanker to take on oil from
Iraq's pipeline at the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbu. The tanker was
identified as the 80,000-ton Al-Fao, said the sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity. Another Iraqi tanker tried to load up at
the terminal Sunday night.
   The invasion stranded more than 2 million foreigners, including
3,000 Americans kept by Iraqi authorities from leaving Iraq and
Kuwait. About 4,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese also are
trapped.
   On Thursday, Iraqi authorities in Kuwait ordered the 2,500
Americans to assemble at a hotel because of ``unspecified threats''
against them, but few complied, said a senior U.S. official in
Washington.
   The Americans at the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad were brought to
Iraq from Kuwait in the days following the invasion. But the Bush
administration has been careful to avoid referring to the detained
U.S. citizens as hostages.
   A U.S. congressman today warned Iraq would face American
military retaliation if trapped Americans were harmed.
   ``If any U.S. citizen in Kuwait or Iraq is in any way brutalized
or tortured or killed, the United States will retaliate...in a way
that will result in the destruction of the military and economic
infrastructure of Iraq,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
speaking to reporters at Israel's Ben-Gurion airport. Solarz is a
member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   Britain _ whose nationals in Kuwait were also ordered to
assemble _ said it feared the order was a prelude to internment.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd accused Iraq today of using ``the
tactic of the outlaw down the ages'' by intimidating foreign
nationals.
   About 7,000 foreigners fled to Jordan from Iraq and Kuwait on
Thursday, but only a handful of Westerners were among them.
   The British Foreign Office said today that Iraqi officials did
not show up at the hotel by late Thursday. ``We have basically
advised people to stay at home pending further information,'' a
Foreign Office spokesman said.
   Iraq's repatriation of Iranian prisoners and its troop
withdrawal followed Saddam's announcement Wednesday that Baghdad
wanted to formally end the eight-year Iran-Iraq war and secure its
eastern border. Peace would enable Iraq to transfer some of its
estimated 300,000 troops on that front to Kuwait and the Saudi
frontier.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said the Tehran
government was releasing Iraqi prisoners today but did not say how
many.
   In other developments:
   _Japan said today it was weighing new measures in response to
the invasion of Kuwait. Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe
suggested Japan might rethink its policy against deploying military
equipment or personnel overseas, and could send Japanese
minesweepers to the Persian Gulf region.
   _Refugees who escaped Kuwait earlier this week said Kuwait city
crackled with gunfire when darkness fell as Kuwaitis staged
hit-and-run raids against the invaders. They claimed that the Iraqi
invaders still not been able to completely stifle resistance by the
citizens of the tiny oil-rich state.
   _A West German prosecutor today said seven people have been
arrested in connection with the alleged delivery of a poison gas
plant to Iraq. The prosecutor said the arrests came after several
years of investigation. Iraq has previously used chemical weapons
against Iran and its own Kurdish minority.
   _An Iraqi cargo ship, reportedly carrying food, steamed through
the Suez Canal toward the Red Sea today after being stranded at the
waterway's entrance for three days, a canal authority official
said. The 7,000-ton Zain al-Qaws was the first Iraqi vessel to
transit the 100-mile-long channel _ the main route for European
shipping to the region _ since the United Nations imposed sanctions
on Iraq on Aug. 6.
   _Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has pursued its
armed forces buildup in Kuwait and its troops there now number
about 160,000. The Iraqis have ringed Kuwait City with an
air-defense system, a U.S. official reported, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The United States and some Arab countries have poured thousands
of troops into Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait Aug.
2 in a dispute over land and oil and massed forces near the Saudis'
northern border.
   Saddam wrote Bush an open letter Thursday calling Bush a liar
and a shallow person, and warned any confrontation could lead to
``thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins.''
   Jordan's King Hussein returned from the United States today and
a Jordanian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
monarch might fly to Iraq to brief Saddam on his talks with Bush.
   Bush said after meeting Thursday with the Jordanian monarch that
``I did not come away with any feeling of hope'' Iraqi forces will
leave Kuwait.
   The president also said King Hussein assured him Jordan would
close Aqaba, the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade, as
the economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated.
Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry; Iraq
imports about three-quarters of its food.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in Peru
Thursday that the use of military power to enforce U.N. sanctions
on Iraq violates the U.N. charter unless the world body's Security
Council approves it.

   Seven people have been arrested in connection
with the alleged delivery of a poison gas plant to Iraq several
years ago, a West German prosecutor said today.
   The prosecutor, Friedrich Hoffmann in Darmstadt, said that among
those arrested was a man he identified only as Al Kadhi, an Iraqi
specialist employed by the West German foreign intelligence service.
   Hoffmann said the arrests, which came after several years of
investigation, took so long because evidence was needed to prove
that the plant allegedly delivered to Iraq was constructed to
produce poison gas.
   The arrests were based on violation of West German export laws,
which limit and in many cases ban the sale or delivery of weapons
of destruction to areas of conflict such as the Middle East,
Hoffmann said.
   He said the plant produced mustard gas, among other deadly
chemical agents.
   Among those arrested were employees of the Pilot Plant company
in Dreieich, 12 miles south of Frankfurt; workers in the export
section of the Preussag company in Hanover; and from the Walter
Engineering Trading company in Hamburg, Hoffmann said.
   He emphasized that the accusations were directed at individuals
and not at the companies he named.
   The West German news magazine Der Spiegel reported this week
that dozens of German firms were helping Iraq produce rockets,
chemical weapons and ``military nuclear technology.''
   The report, coming in the middle of the Persian Gulf crisis and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's threats to attack Israel with
chemical weapons, angered an already anxious Jerusalem.
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has demanded that steps be
taken against West Germans and others allegedly involved in helping
Iraq develop chemical weapons. He met with West German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Tuesday in Bavaria to discuss
those concerns.
   According to the Spiegel report, Al Kadhi had worked for the
West German foreign intelligence in Iraq, where he was arrested by
Iraqi officials and sentenced to death for spying several years ago.
   The report said that President Richard von Weizsaecker of West
Germany interceded with Iraq for clemency. Following a visit by
Genscher in 1987 for talks with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Al
Kadhi's sentence was reduced to life in prison. A short time later,
Al Kadhi, whom Spiegel described as of German-Iraqi descent,
arrived in West Germany.
   The 51-year-old Al Kadhi began working with the Walter
Engineering Trading company in Hamburg, from where he allegedly
shipped material for producing chemical weapons to Iraq, the
magazine said.
   The material, which the magazine said was shipped to Iraq via
Turkey, was allegedly used to contruct a poison gas plant in Iraq.
The report did not say exactly when the materials for the plant
were shipped to Iraq.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons in the past, both in the
Iran-Iraq war and against Kurds in his own country, and officials
in his government have threatened to use them against U.S. forces
massing in Saudi Arabia.
   West German companies were also involved in developing a
suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant, and possibly a second such
facility. The disclosures in December 1988 raised a storm of
protest.
   In June, Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, head of the
Imhausen-Chemie company, was found guilty of shipping materials for
an alleged chemical weapons plant in Libya. He was sentenced to
five years in prison.
   Prosecutors said earlier this month that Imhausen may have
supplied plans for a second chemical weapons facility.
   The United States alleged that the first plant, in Rabta 50
miles from Tripoli, was intended to produce chemical weapons.
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi denied it and said the plant was
for pharmaceuticals.
   In addition, Italy, Britain, Turkey, Greece and West Germany
have all seized material in the last year meant for Baghdad and
suspected of being components of a giant gun, capable of firing
shells hundreds of miles.

<TEXT>
   The state agreed to revise its ``Learnfare''
program, which cuts welfare benefits to families whose children
skip school, in order to meet a judge's objections that it may be
unfair in some cases.
   Critics and supporters of the controversial 2-year-old program
should reach a final agreement by November, said Edward Marion,
chief counsel for the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social
Services.
   ``We have essentially agreed in principle on what is necessary
to lift the injunction,'' Marion said Thursday following a hearing
before U.S. District Judge Terence T. Evans.
   Last month, Evans ordered the suspension of Learnfare in
Milwaukee, saying record-keeping errors had resulted in unfair
treatment of some families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.
   The advocacy group Legal Action of Wisconsin had sued on behalf
of six families who claimed their AFDC benefits were wrongly cut
because of errors in school attendance records.
   The injunction applied only to the 3,200 teen-agers attending
Milwaukee Public Schools that have lost or were in danger of losing
benefits. The program is still in effect elsewhere in Wisconsin.
   Anne DeLeo, a lawyer for Legal Action, told Evans that the state
and her group have agreed that Milwaukee County and the state
Department of Health and Social Services will verify students'
attendance records before reducing their parents' welfare benefits.
   She said the state also will investigate teen-agers' reasons for
skipping school to make sure the absences were not for legitimate
reasons such as illness or death in the family.
   The state also agreed to issue notices to a teen-ager and the
family when they are being monitored for possible sanction.
   ``We've got the agreement in principle that these things should
be done,'' Ms. DeLeo said. ``How we do that and with what personnel
we do it is still undecided.''
   Learnfare, authorized by the Legislature in 1987, deducts about
$100 a month for an average family receiving $517 a month in AFDC
benefits if one of its teen-agers is consistently truant.
   Legal Action attorneys estimated that 1,600 to 2,000 Milwaukee
students were sanctioned each month under the program.
   Of the 30,000 students subject to Learnfare, half live in
Milwaukee County, and three-fourths of the sanctions have been
levied there, according to state figures.
   Evans scheduled the next status hearing for Jan. 8, but said the
injunction could be lifted sooner.

   Thousands more foreigners poured into
Jordan today from Iraq, fleeing the crisis set off by Baghdad's
takeover of Kuwait. Only a few Westerners were among them.
   A Jordanian border official said 6,500 foreigners, mainly
Egyptians, crossed into Jordan from Iraq at the Ruweishid frontier
post. They included eight French citizens, four East Germans and a
Canadian, all of Arab origin, he reported.
   Officials estimate that about 16,300 foreigners in all have fled
from Iraq into Jordan since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   In Baghdad, U.S. officials today demanded to see more than 30
Americans held in Iraq, following word they were no longer in the
luxury hotel where Iraqi soldiers had detained them.
   ``We understand the 35 Americans who were in the Rashid Hotel
have been moved. We think we know where they are but we have not
seen them,'' a source at the State Department said today. The
Americans were brought to Baghdad from Kuwait after the invasion.
   In Britain, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd accused Iraq today of
using ``the tactic of the outlaw down the ages'' by intimidating
British nationals in Kuwait.
   The comment came one day after Iraqi military authorities
ordered Britons and Americans to assemble at Kuwait hotels, but
then failed to turn up to meet them. There are 4,000 Britons and
2,500 Americans in Kuwait.
   ``We are trying to clarify the situation both in Baghdad and in
Kuwait,'' a British Foreign Office spokesman said. ``We have
basically advised people to stay at home pending further
information.''
   Also today, Japan complained to Baghdad that it is violating
international norms in refusing to permit the 500 Japanese citizens
in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait to leave, the Japanese Foreign
Ministry said.
   In Amman, the visiting foreign ministers from Italy, Ireland and
Luxembourg, warned that Iraqi refusal to let the 20,000 Westerners
in Iraq and Kuwait leave might worsen the Persian Gulf crisis. They
asked Jordan to intercede with Baghdad.
   The foreign ministers _ Gianni de Michelis of Italy, Gerald
Collins of Ireland and Georges Wohlfart of Luxembourg _ addressed a
joint news conference after meeting Thursday with Crown Prince
Hassan and other Jordanian officials.
   Jordan, an ally of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, has tried to
remain neutral in the crisis.
   King Hussein has committed himself to sanctions imposed by the
U.N. Security Council on Iraq, but news reports have said that
Iraqi imports and exports are still passing through the Jordanian
port of Aqaba on the Red Sea.
   De Michelis said the Economic Commmunity might provide economic
assistance to Jordan to help meet any hardships enforcing sanctions
might entail.
   A U.S. Embassy diplomat said the evacuees reaching Jordan
Thursday included three U.S. citizens of Indian origin. They
crossed at Ruweishid, about 205 miles northeast of Amman, he said.
   The other Westerners were three Bangladeshis with dual British
and Bangladeshi nationality, and a Frenchwoman, the official said.
Most of the Arab evacuees were Egyptians.

<TEXT>
   The state casino board today said it
would hold off ruling on Donald Trump's financial restructuring
until next Tuesday despite his attorneys' pleas that a quick ruling
was needed to stave off a possible bankruptcy.
   Valerie Armstrong, acting chairwoman of the Casino Control
Commission, said the panel realizes the importance of a quick
decision but said it needed more time to look over the more than
1,000 pages of documents detailing a $65 million emergency loan
granted to Trump in June by banks.
   ``As far as I am concerned, this is expedited,'' Ms. Armstrong
said.
   On Thursday, Trump attorney Thomas Cerabino had said that if the
panel delays making its ruling for a week, the plan could fall
apart because the delay could trigger a string of defaults.
   But today, Ed Tracy, president of the developer's three Atlantic
City casinos, played down any such talk. Asked about the effects of
the delay until Tuesday, Tracy said ``Nothing specifically. It's
merely a delay.''
   Trump himself had no comment.
   After the flamboyant developer missed a June 15 bond payment on
the Trump Castle casino, he entered into feverish negotiations with
a group of seven banks. The bankers agreed to an emergency $65
million loan secured by equity in his three casinos.
   But the agreement isn't final until it is approved by the state
casino commission.
   In its closing arguments today, the state Division of Gaming
Enforcement recommended approval of the deal, but said it was doing
so reluctantly and attached 13 conditions. Trump attorneys said the
organization would have no trouble meeting the conditions, which
were primarily reporting requirements.
   Thomas Auriemma, a deputy state attorney general, said the
gaming division was recommending approval of the deal because ``the
situation for the Trump Organization is critical. There are no easy
or viable alternatives.''
   ``The company has left us at this point with little
alternative,'' Auriemma said. ``The Division reluctantly recommends
approval.''
   In his closing arguments, Trump attorney Nicholas Ribis pleaded
with the commission to approve the deal, saying Trump has always
honored his pledges and remains committed to Atlantic City.
   Documents released Wednesday show Trump's debt at $3.2 billion
against assets worth between $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion.
   On Thursday, Auriemma had described the Trump organization as
``in dire straits'' and said the possibility of complete financial
collapse ``is not out of the question.''
   But Stephen Bollenbach, hired Thursday as the Trump
Organization's chief financial officer, told the commission the
Trump empire could shed its debt.
   ``Clearly, things need to change in this company,'' said
Bollenbach. ``I don't think that means we're in dire straits but
certainly somebody else might.''
   Among the 13 conditions recommneded by the division are
requirements that Trump return in three weeks after any commission
decision to detail his plan for making a $47 million bond payment
Nov. 15 on the Taj Mahal Casino Resort.

   A state representative announced he was
withdrawing his re-election bid and revealed he had been working
undercover to help the FBI's investigation of corruption among
fellow legislators.
   ``While some people might question the wisdom of assisting (the
FBI) in their investigation, I can only say, `When the FBI wants
you to cooperate, you will cooperate,' '' state Rep. Robert Kohn
said, reading from a letter he said he was mailing to constituents.
   In his statement Thursday, Kohn acknowledged that in his 15
years in the Legislature, he had become part of the corrupt system
he had intended to reform. He said he had been working for the FBI
for several months.
   The Charleston Republican refused to answer questions, but a
newspaper reported he had discussed a plea bargain with prosecutors.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel also declined to answer questions
about Kohn's statement, including whether it had been cleared with
him.
   Sources have said the FBI videotaped legislators taking money. A
federal grand jury looking into the case meets Tuesday.
   The investigation, dubbed ``Operation Broken Trust,'' also
involves lobbyist Ron Cobb, a former House member. According to
legislators, he offered them cash in exchange for their support on
a bill that would have allowed pari-mutuel betting in South
Carolina.
   Kohn reported accepting $150 from Cobb.
   In his letter, Kohn revealed little of the details of his
participation with the FBI or how he got involved.
   ``When I first went to Columbia, I resolved to change the way
business was done ... the good ol' boy system, if you will. I not
only failed to do that, but I became a part of the system itself,''
Kohn said.
   ``The irony is that by cooperating with the FBI, I am indeed
facilitating change, but in a much different and more drastic
manner than I had ever imagined.''
   He withdrew from his contest with Democrat Ida Morea for
``personal and business reasons,'' Kohn said, but he added his
withdrawal will ``grant me the additional latitude I need to assist
the FBI and the U.S. attorney in their investigation and
prosecution of public corruption in South Carolina.''
   The State newspaper quoted unidentified sources as saying that
Kohn spent part of this week reviewing videotapes and working out a
plea bargain with federal attorneys.
   Kohn, an insurance consultant, was the only one of the 16
lawmakers known to have been questioned by the FBI who faced
opposition in the November election.

   An appeals board today overturned a ban on a film
depicting author Salman Rushdie as a drunken sadist who murders
Moslems.
   Rushdie had urged the Video Appeals Committee to lift the ban on
``International Guerillas.'' The ban was imposed last month on
grounds that the work could be criminally libelous.
   In a passionate written statement, Rushdie said he did not seek
the dubious protection of censorship.
   ``The banning of `International Guerillas,' however well
intentioned, can only damage the process of reconciliation, and I
urge the committee to reverse tnd offered to testify in defense of the
video
if the distributor ever faced a criminal libel suit.
   The committee, which had 21 days to rule, rendered its decision
within a few hours of hearing testimony.

   Passengers were taken a short distance by helicopter to Hayes
Island in the Arctic Ocean over a period of several hours, Tass

   Tourists visited the bathhouse and homes on the island, where

   The Soviet capital, which often boasts of having
the world's best ice cream, has a shortage in these waning days of
summer, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Ice cream kiosks on street corners and city parks have been
displaying ``No Ice Cream'' signs, although they continue to sell
souvenirs, marshmallows, chocolates and other candies,
Komsomolskaya Pravda reported.
   Ice cream is still available at foreign outlets, such as the
Baskin-Robbins stores in the Rossia Hotel and on the Arbat
pedestrian mall, or the Soviet-Swiss joint venture Pinguin.
   But lines are long and prices are high for Muscovites who have
always taken pride in their own ice cream, which they buy in
paper-wrapped slabs or on sticks, rather than in cones.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted Mosgortorg, the Directorate for
State-Run Trade in Moscow, as saying two of the three ice
cream-making factories in Moscow are closed for repairs this
summer. One might reopen early next month, it said.

   A judge Friday refused to grant bail to
the pilot of a hot-air balloon involved in an accident last year
that killed 13 people.
   Michael Sanby, a South African native, was arrested Thursday
while preparing to board a flight to Zimbabwe. He has not been
charged in the accident near Alice Springs, in central Australia.
But police issued a provisional warrant for unlawful killing. Alice
Springs Coroner Denis Barrett heard a recommendation this week that
Sanby face 13 counts of manslaughter.
   Sanby's attorney told a court hearing Friday he would not fight
extradition. In applying for bail, Sanby offered to surrender his
passport and take the first available return flight to Alice
Springs.
   But police said they feared Sanby would try to reach his native
South Africa, which has no extradition arrangements with Australia.
Judge Kenneth Moore rejected the bail request.
   Frank Gaffy, a lawyer assisting the coroner in his
investigation, said there was evidence Sanby deliberately collided
with another balloon Aug. 13, 1989.
   The basket of Sanby's balloon hit and tore open a lower balloon
carrying 13 people. All of them died when the balloon fell to the
ground.

   The announcement said the guerrillas were killed in Sirnak
province on Thursday.
   The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist

   Police fired tear gas today to
break up groups of armed men as authorities tried to halt savage
black factional fighting that has killed at least 178 people in the
past five days.
   At least five people were killed today in Soweto, police said.
Police in armored vehicles dispersed groups of Zulus armed with
axes and spears in various parts of Soweto, witnesses said.
   The African National Congress today accused the South African
security forces of inciting township violence in a bid to divide
the black majority. ANC supporters have accused police of aiding
Inkatha in the violence, a charge denied by authorities.
   ``It is a matter of record that the South African government has
developed a well-known capacity for destabilization'' in
neighboring countries, the ANC said. ``It is our conviction that
these methods and tactics have been brought to bear on the home
front'' to bring about ``insecurity, fear and a willingness to
submit to draconian measures.''
   The police again used tear gas to halt a late morning
confrontation between a group of Zulus and Soweto residents, the
witnesses said. At least 26 people were killed and 217 injured in
Soweto in two days of violence between rival Zulus and Xhosas,
police said.
   The Soweto deaths raised the overall toll to 178 in five days of
fighting in several Johannesburg townships, where police were still
finding bodies from clashes earlier in the week.
   ``Most were hacked to death,'' a police spokesman, Col. Tienie
Halgryn, told the independent South African Press Association.
   Police said today that hundreds of people had also been injured
in the five days of fighting.
   A family of six, including four children, was admitted to a
hospital today after their home in the Kagiso township was
firebombed, police said. A police spokeswoman said it was an
isolated incident.
   The fighting pits Zulu supporters of the conservative Inkatha
movement against mostly Xhosa members of the ANC led by Nelson
Mandela.
   Nationalism is intense among the Zulus, the largest tribal group
in South Africa. Many Zulus involved in the fighting say they would
not accept Mandela and the ANC as a future government.
   Throughout the night, blacks erected street barricades in Soweto
with burning tires and debris that police tore down. Police fired
tear gas to disperse roaming bands, the witnesses said.
   The spreading unrest led to an unscheduled meeting Thursday
between Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk. Mandela later met with
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. The two sides agreed to form
peace committees composed of police, ANC and Inkatha members in the
troubled areas.
   But police said an initial meeting scheduled for today at a
Soweto police station was delayed.
   On Thursday night, white right-wing protesters hurled a tear-gas
bomb into a community hall in Vryheid in northern Natal where de
Klerk was giving a speech. Police dispersed the pro-apartheid
protesters, and de Klerk delivered the speech outside the hall.
   As dawn broke today, many of Soweto's 2 million residents began
heading for work in nearby Johannesburg, and police said most areas
were returning to normal. Many people stayed home Thursday to
protect their homes.
   The fighting this week was considered some of the worst in five
years of conflict that originated in South Africa's eastern Natal
province. More than 5,000 blacks have died in the conflict.
   Inkatha and the ANC oppose apartheid, but are divided by
leadership rivalry, tribal loyalty and differing visions of a
future South Africa.
   The move of the conflict into Johannesburg and other parts of
Transvaal Province indicates the struggle for power between the two
sides is heating up while the white-led government moves toward
majority rule. De Klerk has promised to end apartheid and share
political power with the black majority.

   Japan is considering breaking with its long-held
policy against deployment of military equipment overseas as it
considers responses to the Persian Gulf crisis, a Foreign Ministry
official said Friday.
   Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters he did ``not
preclude'' the possibility the government was considering sending
minesweepers to the Middle East.
   Asked about the constitutionality of this, he said: ``To make it
a reality we have to go through various heated discussions among
various agencies in the government as well as take into
consideration the public opinion of Japan. ... If there is any
difference of opinion on constitutionality, we go down to the roots
of the discussion and find out whether it is constitutional or not.
   ``That is what we are doing right now.''
   Japan's postwar constitution bars the use of force as a means of
settling international disputes and forbids the maintenance of
land, air and sea forces. Since the early 1950s, that has been
interpreted as allowing a purely defensive military.
   Current law also restricts the Self-Defense Forces, Japan's
military, to Japanese territory, except for participation in
ceremonial occasions overseas.
   Changes in the law would likely bring a strong reaction from
Japanese opposition parties and neighboring countries opposed to a
greater role for Japan's military.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama began a nine-day trip to the
Middle East on Friday to visit countries affected by the
Iraq-Kuwait crisis. His mission is to determine what actions Japan
can take to help the international effort to punish Iraq for
invading Kuwait, Watanabe said.
   Japanese news reports said the sending of minesweepers could be
seen as a defensive act needed to protect Japan's oil supply. Japan
imports 99 percent of the oil it uses and is more dependent on
Middle East oil than any industrialized nation.
   Japan's military remains controversial here, and increases in
defense spending are hotly debated. Asian nations invaded by Japan
during World War II also have opposed increases in Japan's military
strength.
   Japan previously has sent non-military personnel to join
peacekeeping or monitoring forces in Nambia, Nicaragua and along
the Afghan border.
   Watanabe said Japanese public opinion, once sharply opposed to
any kind of military involvement overseas, has changed. ``That kind
of opposition which I have seen before is much, much less these
days,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Rebel leader Charles Taylor suffered
minor injuries in an auto accident, delaying his departure for
peace talks with a rival rebel chief and an envoy to President
Samuel K. Doe, an official said today.
   Tom Woewiyu, Taylor's spokesman and defense minister, said the
accident occurred as the rebel chief prepared to leave Liberia for
talks Monday in Banjul, Gambia on how to resolve Liberia's
8-month-old civil war.
   The accident was not serious, but Taylor returned to the
Firestone Rubber plantation clinic for treatment and to arrange new
transport, Woewiyu said from Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The plantation
is 35 miles southeast of Monrovia.
   Woewiyu did not say when Taylor would leave Liberia for Banjul.
   The meeting was announced Thursday by Gambian government
sources. Word of the talks could lead to further delays in the
deployment of a six-nation West African force charged with halting
the fighting.
   U.S. Marines today flew about 360 Indian nationals from the USS
Saipan off the Liberian coast to Freetown, capital of neighboring
Sierra Leone. They were airlifted Thursday from the U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia to the warship.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Freetown told reporters the Marines
had evacuated about 700 people in the past week, mostly foreigners,
and would continue evacuating the capital on Sunday.
   The United States has sent troops and ships to protect U.S.
installations in Liberia but says it will not intervene militarily
to end the conflict.
   The agreement on a Liberian meeting to end the war was being
arranged between both rebel factions and a Doe envoy, said
government sources in Banjul.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Taylor and
rival rebel leader Prince Johnson were expected to attend talks
Monday in Banjul.
   Nigerian and Guinean troops, meanwhile, are mobilizing in
Freetown, Sierra Leone, with soldiers from Gambia, Ghana, Sierra
Leone and Togo forming a force to exceed 2,500 men.
   The international force is charged with ending the civil war
that has killed about 5,000 people, most of them civilians.
   Taylor's rebels had evacuated most foreigners _ but not scores
of Guineans and Nigerians _ from Monrovia's battlefront in an
18-vehicle convoy on Wednesday.
   Woewiyu said Nigeria and Guinea, whose leaders are friends of
Doe, are trying to use the West African force as a cover to get
troops into Liberia to bolster the besieged president.
   Johnson controls most of the capital and Taylor the rest of this
country of 2.3 million people. But Doe has refused to leave the
presidential mansion, which is protected by government troops.
   Insurgents of Taylor's National Patriotic Front invaded from
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 to oust what they called the corrupt
government of President Doe. Fighting between Taylor, a former Doe
aide accused of embezzlement, and a splinter group led by former
army officer Johnson has prolonged the conflict.
   The war has become a tribal conflict with rebels killing
civilians of Doe's Krahn tribe and Mandingos accused of supporting
him. Soldiers have slaughtered people of the Gio and Mano tribes,
to which most rebels belong.

   Jurors in the Central Park jogger case listened
today to the testimony of the mother of one of three teen-agers
charged in the brutal gang rape that left the runner near death.
   Jurors in their ninth days of deliberations listened to
testimony given by Antron McCray's mother, Linda. Her tearful
testimony included allegations that police investigators yelled at
her son to induce him to say he had committed crimes.
   The panel on Thursday listened again to testimony given by
McCray's father, Bobby, who testified that he encouraged his son to
admit to things he did not do under the impression he was working
out a deal to hlep his son avoid being charged.
   Antron McCray had said in a videotaped statement that he kicked
the jogger and feigned having sex with her.
   McCray's lawyer, Michael Joseph, said the jury request's to hear
testimony from his client's parents indicated that at least one
person and possibly more were questioning whether the statements
were taken properly.
   McCray, 16, Raymond Santana, 15, and Yusef Salaam, 16, are
accused of raping and trying to kill the jogger on her nightly run
in Central Park on April 19, 1989.
   In addition to the attack on the female runner, the three are
also charged with attacking two male joggers in the park that
night. The other charges against the youths include sexual abuse,
riot, assault and robbery.
   Earlier Thursday, the jury reheard graphic testimony about the
jogger's condition after the attack. She was taken to Metropolitan
Hospital in a coma, with severe skull and facial fractures and
three-fourths of her blood gone.
   The jogger eventually recovered and returned to her job as a
Wall Street investment banker, but she testified that she still
suffers from impaired balance, vision and smell. She said she
doesn't remember the attack.

   The woman at the heart of a clerical sex scandal
claims she was married to former Atlanta Roman Catholic Archbishop
Eugene Marino, and her lawyer says they were trying to have a baby.
   Vicki Long, who also claims to have been romantically involved
with one other priest, spoke publicly Thursday for the first time
since Marino's resignation in July as the nation's highest-ranking
black Roman Catholic.
   Gloria Allred, charged at a news conference that church
officials eager to split up the couple tried to convince Ms. Long
that Marino is insane.
   A spokesman for Marino denied the charges and said the church
does not believe Ms. Long and Marino were married.
   ``We are making no claims whatsoever that the archbishop was
insane. We never have made such claims,'' the Rev. Peter Dora said.
``Archbishop Marino has made it clear that there was no marriage
ceremony or vows and that he is not or never was married to Vicki
Long.''
   Marino, 56, resigned earlier this summer because of his two-year
involvement with Ms. Long. Though Catholic priests take lifelong
vows of celibacy, church officials acknowledge that the couple had
an ``intimate relationship.''
   Ms. Long said the relationship was not simply an affair.
   ``Archbishop Marino and I exchanged marriage vows in December
(1988) and I have considered myself to be married to him since that
time,'' she said, reading from a statement.
   Ms. Long, 27, of Riverdale did not answer questions at the news
conference. She said the church supported her financially but
damaged her relationship with Marino.
   ``I believe that people who are trusted by the archbishop and
who benefited from that trust have now turned against him,'' she
said. ``I encourage Archbishop Marino to be strong, to know that I
still love him and that I stand by him.''
   The archbishop ``seduced her, married her, lived with her as
husband and wife and now has been taken away from her by her
church,'' Ms. Allred said.
   The two ``spent almost every night together when he was in
town'' and dated openly, Ms. Allred said. At the height of the
romance, the couple tried to have a child, the lawyer said.
   In December 1988 Marino performed a wedding ceremony in which
the two exchanged rings, the lawyer said.
   Ms. Allred said whether the marriage was legal will be
``determined at a later point,'' and she refused to say whether a
marriage certificate had been filed.
   After Marino went into seclusion, ``he was calling Vicki six or
seven times a day and telling her that the church was placing
considerable pressure on him to resign and trying to convince him
that he was sick and crazy,'' Ms. Allred said.
   Two persons close to Marino disputed Ms. Long's contention that
she and the former archbishop spent significant amounts of time
together.
   ``The week before he left, he worked 103 hours, and I was with
him all the time,'' said Gerard O'Connor, Marino's administrative
assistant and chauffeur. ``I never saw them together.''
   Marino's housemate for about a year until May, the Rev. Don
Kenny, director of vocations for the archdiocese, said he never saw
Ms. Long in the house and that Marino stayed at the house virtually
every night he was in town.
   Bishop James P. Lyke, acting administrator of the archdiocese,
on Thursday denied a report by TV station WAGA that Marino, who
church officials said was admitted to a psychiatric hospital a week
before, had overdosed on pills and was under a suicide watch at St.
Vincent's Hospital in Harrison, N.Y.
   Approached at his hospital room Thursday by a reporter from The
Atlanta Constitution, Marino said he had no comment.
   The Rev. Michael Woods of Sandy Springs also resigned because of
``intimate'' ties to Ms. Long, but she denied she had a sexual
relationship with Woods. She has filed a lawsuit against the church
claiming the Rev. Donal Keohane, formerly of Columbus, fathered her
4-year-old daughter.
   Blood tests proved Keohane was not the father but the church is
paying child support.

<HEAD>US-Iraq Diplomacy: No Decorum in Mideast Crisis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   ``There's been a minimum of conviviality, I
can assure you.''
   One U.S. official used those words to sum up the trying times of
the handful of American diplomats who deal directly with Iraqi
authorities these days.
   Presidents Bush and Saddam Hussein have accused each other of
lying but at least are able to exchange the insults at long
distance. American and Iraqi diplomats don't have that luxury.
   For example, the officer in charge of the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad, Joseph Wilson, or a stand-in, goes to the Iraqi Foreign
Ministry several times a day on behalf of the 3,000 Americans
stranded in Kuwait and Iraq. He always comes back empty-handed.
   Less frequently, Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohammed
Mashiq al-Mashat, is summoned to the 6th floor State Department
office that deals with the Persian Gulf issue.
   ``He sits upstairs and tells us he doesn't know and then comes
downstairs (to the press) and denies everything,'' said one
official, articulating a widely shared frustration among U.S.
diplomats.
   Al-Mashat's meetings at the State Department usually are ``short
and heated,'' said another official. The Iraqi envoy was
unavailable to give his account of the sessions.
   Wilson, aside from his discussions at the Foreign Ministry, also
has been checking in with more than 30 Americans detained under
armed guard at the Hotel Rashid in Baghdad, keeping them apprised
of developments. Wilson, making his rounds in 100 degree plus heat,
has yet to bring them good news.
   On Friday, the situation for the Americans may have taken an
ominous turn with reports they had been moved. For the first time,
embassy officials were unable to visit with them.
   As the U.S.-Iraqi military confrontation mounts, a six-year
American effort to cultivate Baghdad is looking like one of the
more futile diplomatic exercises of the past decade.
   Starting with the normalization of relations in November 1984,
the United States has tried to woo the Iraqis through expanded
trade and other ties. Since the events of Aug. 2, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait, diplomats like Wilson have been left to pick up the pieces.
   At each meeting with Iraqi authorities, U.S. diplomats have
stated in the clearest terms the U.S. demand that Iraq allow the
stranded Americans to leave.
   As officials describe it, the Iraqi explanations for their
actions have been increasingly unconvincing. More and more, the
Americans look like pawns in the war of nerves between the two
governments. Saddam's actions, according to some analysts, suggest
that he sees the Americans on his turf as insurance against an
all-out U.S. military attack.
   That he regards the Americans as bargaining chips seemed more
evident on Thursday when Iraqi military authorities ordered all
2,500 Americans in Kuwait to report to a downtown hotel in Kuwait
City. The order has been widely ignored.
   The Iraqis generally have given contradictory accounts of what
they have in mind for the Americans. Al-Mashat has said the
Americans will be free to leave ``in due course'' but other envoys
have said flatly the Americans will be forced to stay put until the
current crisis ends.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Nazir
Hamdoon has been citing bureaucratic delays in explaining why the
Americans have not been allowed to leave.
   ``We have told them that Iraqi credibility has been severely
strained,'' one American official said.

<HEAD>Navy Gives First Public Look at New Stealth Attack Aircraft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy today released the first artist's
drawing of its A-12 Avenger attack airplane, the latest in a family
of aircraft with stealth radar-evading technology.
   The plane, now under development, is designed as a bomber to
replace the A-6E Intruder, which has been the Navy's main attack
aircraft for the past 27 years.
   No details were provided on the exact dimensions and other
features of the previously secret Avenger, which resembles a manta
ray.
   The Avenger is designed to penetrate sophisticated missiles
defenses to deliver bombs with exceptional accuracy against fixed
and mobile targets on land and sea.
   The aircraft is in the full-scale development stage under a
$4.78 billion contract held jointly by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and
General Dynamics Corp. No estimate was given of the full cost of
the program, but it has been reported that extended production
could cost as much as $55 billion.
   The Navy said it plans to buy 620 of the planes. Money for
testing and evaluating the first six Avengers is in the current
Pentagon budget.
   The plane is named after the World War II attack aircraft that
was the first such plane with radar.

   Rangers cleared the way for the return of visitors to a section
of Yosemite National Park today more than a week after the park was
closed by forest fires for the first time in its 100-year history.
   Overall in California, crews mopped up after major blazes that
scorched more than 400 square miles statewide. In Idaho and
Washington, firefighters corralled stubborn fires that erupted
after a rash of lightning storms.
   California state firefighter Kenneth E. Enslow, 20, was to be
buried today. He suffered head injuries while fighting a blaze in
the Mendocino National Forest.
   Sections of Yosemite served by Tioga Pass Road, a highway across
the Sierra Nevada, were to open at midday today for the first time
since Aug. 9. The park's most popular destination, Yosemite Valley,
will probably not reopen until Monday, rangers said.
   ``They've got to mop up and make sure they're completely out and
winds don't start up again,'' said National Park Service spokesman
Mark Rabenstein. ``The fire crew actually touches the ground to
make sure it is out.''
   By this morning, California firefighters had virtually
surrounded most of the major fires among the 1,300 that broke out
since Aug. 3.
   ``The siege is winding down, but it's definitely not over. We
still have a lot of firefighters on the lines and a lot of mop-up
to do,'' said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman Karen
Terrill.
   In Yosemite, 23,576 acres of timber land have burned. Of the two
biggest fires in the 757,000-acre park, one was 100 percent
contained this morning by fire lines, the other 95 percent
contained, Rabenstein said.
   Two other Northern California fires that charred more than
144,000 acres of timber and brush were declared 90 percent
contained Thursday night.
   The wave of fires burned nearly 262,000 acres, or about 409
square miles statewide, and destroyed 127 structures. There have
been 37,532 recorded lightning strikes since Aug. 3.
   The cost of battling the blazes, with 15,500 firefighters
involved, was estimated at $45 million.
   In Washington, cooling weather helped firefighters contain the
state's largest wildfire, a 604-acre blaze in the rugged Cascade
Mountain wilderness, said Corky Broaddus, spokeswoman for Wenatchee
National Forest.
   In Idaho, 250 reinforcements joined the fight against a
1,500-acre fire in Boise National Forest. Air tankers pounded the
blaze with chemical retardant, and authorities said the blaze could
be contained by Sunday evening. The arrival of cooler temperatures
and a rainstorm with only a limited amount of lightning overnight
aided firefighters in the state, they said.
   In Alabama, a 50-acre forest fire forced the evacuation of 10
houses near Lillian and sent four firefighters on loan from Florida
to a Pensacola, Fla. hospital with heat exhaustion.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Says Students Who Don't Speak English Not

<DATELINE>LAREDO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos told
educators from this Texas-Mexico border area today that students
who do not speak English are not ready to learn, and drew swift
criticism.
   Cavazos, speaking to about 1,500 Laredo principals and teachers,
urged them to get parents more involved in education and to make
sure students have a command of English.
   ``Parental involvement and language competency are basic,''
Cavazos said. ``If that child cannot speak English the first day of
school, that child is not ready to learn.''
   In a panel discussion afterward, South Texas superintendents
took issue with Cavazos' statement about language.
   ``The comment that we heard this morning that students who are
not speaking English are not ready to learn is a disabling
comment,'' Robert Zamora, superintendent of the La Joya school
district, said to rousing applause. Zamora said students are
capable of learning in other languages.
   Cavazos, a native of South Texas and former president of Texas
Tech University, said he supports bilingual education, but said its
goal should be to move the students into speaking English.
   Young people cannot take full advantage of all opportunities in
the United States without speaking English, he said.
   Cavazos said the Bush administration favors giving educators
more freedom because that helps ensure parental involvement and
language competency.
   Throughout his speech, Cavazos emphasized his remarks referred
to national education, not specifically to Laredo or Texas.
   That said, Cavazos again stated his position that spending more
money is not the answer to education problems. He said how money is
spent is more important.
   Earlier this year, Cavazos came under fire from some state
lawmakers when he made that statement in a speech to the Texas
Legislature, which was grappling with school finance reform.
   Cavazos today mentioned the Texas finance dilemma. ``Here in
Texas, much of the attention has been on school finance, and there
have been some inequities,'' he said.
   Later today, Cavazos was to cross the border to Nuevo Laredo to
sign a first-ever binational education agreement with Mexico.

   Local officials across the country are
beginning to receive preliminary housing counts, the Census Bureau
reports.
   Official population numbers won't be issued until at least the
end of the year, though preliminary ones will be sent to state
officials within a few weeks.
   The early housing reports are designed to allow local
governments to challenge the Bureau's findings, pointing out areas
where homes and people may have been missed, officials said.
   The census got under way in March with the mailing of nearly 100
million forms. In recent weeks workers have been going door-to-door
to try to count people who were missed in the first phase.
   Sending the preliminary count to local officials does not mean
that the effort is complete, Census Director Barbara Everitt Bryant
said.
   The figures are open to challenge and workers will be sent out
to double-check areas where officials question the totals.
   In addition to sending housing counts to city, county and town
officials, preliminary population counts will be sent to state
governors, state redistricting officials and members of Congress
who has requested the information.

   Soviet Justice Minister V.F. Yakovlev said at
the close of a week-long visit Friday that he looks forward to
continued discussions on legal regulation of economic markets.
   ``We have simply lost the talent for market regulation and we
have to relearn all this,'' Yakovlev said during a joint news
conference with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   The meetings resulted from similar sessions last October in
Moscow when the two agreed to a regular exchange of information on
legislation and judicial decisions regarding topics such as
individual rights, the environment, organized crime, drug
trafficking, trade and immigration.
   Thornburgh and Yakovlev signed another joint statement Friday
agreeing to continue the discussions and expand them to include
consumer protection, civil litigation, civil rights matters and
federalism.
   In addition, they agreed to study development of a bilateral
arrangement to help each other on civil and criminal cases as well
as the formal establishment of working groups to address annually
the administration of justice issues.
   As part of the U.S. exchange of legislative actions, Thornburgh
said he had presented to the Soviets a Russian-language summary of
the recently passed civil rights law, the Americans With
Disabilities Act.
   Yakovlev said his country has made great advances in the last 18
months in establishing a separation of powers with individual
executive, legislative and judicial branches similar to what exists
in the United States.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, as part of perestroika, has
expressed interest in developing a legal system that relies on due
process rather than arbitrary decisions of bureaucrats.
   ``This is a very difficult process we're engaged in,'' Yakovlev
said through a translator, but added later that development of such
separate branches of government ``is becoming a reality in the
U.S.S.R.''
   Of particular interest to the Soviets meeting here was ``the
details of the interaction between the three powers'' in the United
States.
   Although the discussions didn't focus on particular legal cases,
Yakovlev said he had heard about the savings and loan crisis in
this country.
   Thornburgh commented, ``To have an S&amp;L crisis, you have to have
S&amp;Ls first.''
   ``We do have them,'' responded Yakovlev, ``perhaps not as well
developed as in the United States.''
   ``That kind of development you don't need,'' quipped Thornburgh.
   One aspect of the U.S. system that particularly interested the
Soviets was the community services program that attempts to mediate
disputes between people before they come into court.
   ``This is something we never had heard about before,'' Yakovlev
said. ``These things are like terra incognita to us.''

   Marion Smith was putting a new roof on
Howard Payne University's Mims Auditorium in May 1945 when he was
distracted by newsboys yelling, ``Extra!'' on the street below.
   Smith was 18 and about to be drafted for service in World War II.
   What he found when he climbed down changed his life and set into
motion what became a reunion of sorts earlier this week.
   The bold headline on the Brownwood Bulletin screamed ``Nazis
Quit,'' and it was followed by a slightly smaller head:
``Unconditional Surrender Ends War in Europe.''
   Smith went back on the roof, laid the paper down and placed
shingles over it.
   ``I remember thinking that if and when the roof was redone,
someone would find the newspaper,'' he said.
   Smith was recently given the job of reroofing the auditorium,
and he found the old newspaper.
   ``The funny thing is that it wasn't where I had remembered
putting it,'' he said.
   He said the discovery thrilled the roofing crew.
   ``It also pleased me to know that at 63, I'm still roofing,''
Smith said.

   Jurors weighing the fate of three former
pilots accused of flying a jetliner while under the influence of
alcohol have instructions not to reach their verdicts solely on
blood-alcohol content.
   The jury met for more than five hours Thursday and for three
hours today in the case, the U.S. Justice Department's first
prosecution under a 1988 federal law prohibiting operation of a
passenger jet while under the influence of alcohol. Jurors were to
resume deliberations Monday.
   In giving the jury the case, U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum
pointed out that there is ``no set standard as to the quantity of
alcohol a person must consume before a person is regarded as being
under the influence of alcohol.''
   He set this definition for being under the influence: ``When a
person is so affected by an alcoholic beverage that the person does
not possess that clearness of intellect and control of himself as
he otherwise would.''
   The offense carries up to 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   The legal limit for driving a car in many states is .10 percent,
but federal law does not specify an illegal blood-alcohol content
for pilots.
   In tests, the Northwest Airlines pilots had blood-alcohol
readings of 0.06 percent, 0.08 percent and, for the captain, 0.13
percent.
   Since the trial opened July 25, defense attorneys have argued
that the pilots were not impaired, and that the proof is that the
40-minute Boeing 727 flight from Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities on
March 8 was flawless.
   The pilots were arrested at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport after a
lumber salesman had reported to the Federal Aviation Administration
that the pilots had been drinking in a bar outside Fargo at least
six hours before the flight left with 91 passengers.
   First officer Robert Kirchner and flight engineer Joseph Balzer
said they shared beer from at least six pitchers the night before
the scheduled 6 a.m. flight. Captain Norman Lyle Prouse said he
drank 15 to 20 rum and colas. A waitress said Balzer and Kirchner
left about 10:30 p.m. and Prouse about 11:30 p.m.
   ``You don't have to find that they were totally smashed, just
that they were under the influence,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Elizabeth de la Vega told the jury.
   A toxicologist estimated in-flight blood-alcohol levels for
Kirchner and Balzer to be equal to about three beers each. Prouse
had the equivalent of about eight mixed drinks in his system at
takeoff, the toxicologist said.
   ``At those levels the defendants were under the influence of
alcohol,'' de la Vega said.
   Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga., Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch,
Colo., and Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn., testified they were not
impaired on the flight. Prouse, an alcoholic, said 35 years of
drinking have given him a high tolerance for alcohol.
   Northwest fired the pilots for violating its 12-hour prohibition
against drinking before flying, and the FAA has revoked their
licenses.

   Borough Manager Ed Treat thinks he has the
solution for busy borough workers afraid to answer nature's call
because a telephone might ring in their absence.
   He installed phones in the restrooms.
   It cost $500 to install the two lines _ one for men and one for
women. But Treat saw the phones as necessary so people in this
community of 3,200 in east-central Pennsylvania wouldn't think
their borough, police and water department offices were empty.
   ``Sometimes two lines are ringing at the same time,'' he said.
``We're understaffed. People want to know if we're there.''
   ``Some people are reluctant to use the phones,'' Treat admitted.
``But I use them. Nobody can see me in there.''

<HEAD>Seven Arrested In Poison Gas Plant Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Police have arrested seven people, including
an intelligence agent, in connection with the alleged delivery of a
deadly poison gas plant to Iraq, a prosecutor said Friday.
   The arrests come as U.S. and other troops deploy in the Persian
Gulf, braced for a possible chemical weapons attack from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's forces.
   Saddam has used chemical weapons in the past against Iranian
troops and Iraq's own Kurdish minority.
   Prosecutor Friedrich Hoffmann in Darmstadt identified one of
those arrested as a man employed by the West German foreign
intelligence service in Iraq. He was identified only as Al Kadhi.
   Hoffmann said the arrests were the result of several years of
investigation.
   The security policy spokesman for the Free Democrats, Olaf
Feldmann, called for tightening of export laws in light of the
developments. The Free Democrats are one of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition partners.
   West German officials were embarrassed by an earlier chemical
weapons scandal. Starting in December 1988, there were disclosures
of widespread West German involvement in constructing one, and
possibly two, chemical weapons plants for Libya.
   The latest arrests stemmed from violations of West German export
laws, Hoffmann said. Those laws limit and in many cases ban the
sale or delivery of weapons of destruction to areas of conflict,
such as the Middle East.
   He said among those arrested were employees of the Pilot Plant
company in Dreieich, a Darmstadt suburb 12 miles south of
Frankfurt; workers in the export section of the Preussag company in
Hanover; and from the Walter Engineering Trading company in Hamburg.
   Hoffmann stressed that the accusations of illegal shipments to
Iraq were directed at individuals, not at the companies.
   The West German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Monday that
dozens of German firms had helped Iraq produce rockets, chemical
weapons and ``military nuclear technology.''
   The report came in the midst of the crisis set off by Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and followed threats by Iraq to attack
Israel with chemical weapons if Iraq is attacked.
   According to the Spiegel report, Al Kadhi worked for the West
German foreign intelligence in Iraq, where he was arrested by Iraqi
officials and sentenced to death for spying several years ago.
   Werner Berghof, press spokesman for the West German intelligence
service, said it was against agency policy to comment on personnel
matters, such as its relationship with Al Kadhi.
   Berghof, reached by telephone at agency headquarters in Munich,
repeated an earlier assertion that the service was not indirectly
or directly involved with the transfer to Iraq of technology or
products needed to make poison gas.
   The Spiegel report said West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker interceded with Iraq for clemency for Al Kadhi.
Following a visit by Genscher in 1987 for talks with the Iraqi
leader, Al Kadhi's sentence was reduced to life in prison.
   A short time later, Al Kadhi, whom Spiegel described as of
German-Iraqi descent, arrived in West Germany.
   The 51-year-old Al Kadhi began working with the Walter Trading
company in Hamburg, from where he allegedly shipped material to
Iraq, the magazine said.
   The material, which the magazine said was shipped to Iraq via
Turkey, was allegedly used to contruct a gas plant in Iraq to
produce mustard and other deadly chemical agents.
   The report did not say exactly when the materials for the plant
were shipped.
   The Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper said that Iraq paid $10
million for the plant. Quoting a former employee of the Walter
Engineering Trading company in Hamburg, the newspaper also said the
plant could have gone into production at the beginning of this year.

<HEAD>Bill Proposes Foreign Ownership of Enterprises</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY RYCKMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has submitted a bill to parliament
that would allow foreign companies to become sole owners of new
enterprises in the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
said Friday.
   It would be the first time in at least 60 years that foreigners
have been allowed to wholly own businesses here. Under current law,
foreign companies must join with Soviet firms in joint ventures.
   ``It is impossible to move toward a market economy while the
country is isolated from the world economy,'' Ryzhkov said in
remarks carried by the official Tass news agency. ``One can no
longer rely on joint ventures alone.''
   Tass quoted a senior official of the State Foreign Economic
Commission, who asked to remain anonymous, as saying the bill would
encourage foreign investment by granting substantial benefits for
joint ventures in which the share of foreign capital exceeds 30
percent.
   In a speech Friday, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the main
cause of the nation's economic crisis was ``the pervasive monopoly
and domination of state property.''
   ``We should carry out privatization, but do this within the
framework of our choice,'' he said.
   Ryzhkov also appealed for the ``consolidation of efforts'' to
move toward a market economy. The government is preparing a program
for such a transition.
   A separate 12-member panel is developing a blueprint for moving
toward a market economy. That panel was appointed by Gorbachev and
Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Soviet Union's largest republic,
Russia.
   Yeltsin on Thursday criticized Ryzhkov and accused him of
duplicating the commission's work by developing a parallel economic
plan. He also said that if both plans are presented to the Soviet
parliament, Russia would adopt its own plan.
   But Tass said Ryzhkov noted that his government began developing
a plan at parliament's request. He expressed surprise that the
Gorbachev-Yeltsin commission was developing an alternative program,
but said his government would be willing to use everything valuable
developed by the commission.
   If they disagree about how to proceed toward a market, ``that
may have unpredictable consequences for the entire union,'' Ryzhkov
warned.
   He also responded to Yeltsin's comment that ``the people do not
trust the country's government.''
   ``Yeltsin is right in one thing: No government will be able to
work without the people's trust,'' Ryzhkov said. ``If Yeltsin's
opinion turns out to be true, the government will have to quit.''
   He said he was convinced that the plan developed by the
government would be completed on schedule and submitted to
parliament for approval.

<HEAD>US Deployments to Gulf Go Beyond Purely Defensive Potential</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf
area, code-named Desert Shield to suggest its defensive intent, is
adding stealth fighter-bombers, Marine amphibious assault units and
other forces normally used for offense.
   ``There's a very substantial offensive capability in that area
now,'' said Joshua Epstein, a defense analyst at the Brookings
Institution, a private research organization. He said the addition
serves two purposes: to help dissuade Saddam Hussein from sending
his army into Saudi Arabia, and to reassure the nervous Saudis.
   The clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities was
the departure Thursday from Langley Air Force Base, Va., of F-117A
stealth fighter-bombers.
   The planes, which saw their first combat action during
December's invasion of Panama, are designed to penetrate heavily
defended areas to attack targets. In Iraq they could hit supply
depots or key oil installations.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said plans
called for sending 22 of the radar-evading fighter-bombers to the
Persian Gulf area.
   Additional signs of a shift toward offense:
   _President Bush on Thursday ordered U.S. naval forces in the
gulf region to begin ``intercepting'' commercial shipping to and
from Iraq and Kuwait to enforce UN economic sanctions against Iraq.
The orders allow the Navy to use force against ships if necessary.
   _An armada of Marine Corps amphibious assault ships is heading
for the Persian Gulf. The seaborne units, equipped with amphibious
tracked vehicles that can travel on land at speeds up to 50 mph,
are designed for offensive as well as defensive operations. They
are supported by a variety of aircraft, including the F-A18 Hornet,
a ground attack airplane also capable of air-to-air combat.
   _The Air Force said B-52 bombers have been sent overseas since
the start of the gulf crisis. B-52s conducted massive bombing raids
in the Vietnam war. Also moved to within striking range of Iraq are
U.S. F-111 long-range bombers in Turkey.
   _The Marines are sending in 45,000 of their finest and deploying
A6-E Intruder bombers used in the U.S. bombing of Libya in 1986.
   Among other weaponry the Marines are taking to Saudi Arabia:
more than 100 M1 battle tanks and more than 150 fixed-wing
aircraft, including Harrier vertical takeoff planes used for light
attack missions and close air support of ground troops.
   Rear Adm. Steve Clarey told an American press pool in Saudi
Arabia on Friday that the Marines will take up defensive positions
but will be ready ``to defend as far forward as they can'' in the
event Iraq's army attacks Saudi Arabia.
   ``We certainly have assault capability,'' he said. ``This is a
mechanized capability with tanks, armored vehicles, light armored
vehicles. They have that mobility and they have that firepower to
go anywhere they're told to go.''
   Bush on Aug. 8 described Desert Shield as ``purely defensive.''
He has said his ultimate goal was to get the Iraqi army out of
Kuwait, which it captured on Aug. 2, and to restore the Kuwaiti
royal family to power. While emphasizing an economic embargo, he
has not ruled out the use of U.S. force to try to dislodge the
Iraqi army.
   Asked whether the F-117A stealth planes had any defensive role
in the gulf crisis, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday,
``I think this gets into the question of deterrence. Some of those
forces that you have there would be deterrent by their mere
presence.''
   Williams was referring to the idea that by sending offensive
weaponry and large numbers of troops to Saudi Arabia, the Bush
administration could deter Saddam from launching an attack out of
fear that his own country would suffer a devastating counterattack.
   Spicing the U.S. military deployments with several prominent
offensive weapons such as the stealth fighter-bomber is part of an
apparent Bush strategy to gain the psychological upper hand.
   The Iraqis are playing equally hard at the intimidation game.
Saddam has strongly suggested he would use his chemical weapons
against U.S. troops if provoked.
   Pentagon sources say contingency plans call for putting as many
as 250,000 air, sea and ground forces in and around Saudi Arabia,
depending on Iraq's military moves.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Hits Seven-Year Low, But Oil Seen as Future Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Record exports and shrinking oil imports
helped push the nation's merchandise trade deficit to a seven-year
low in June, the government reported Friday. But analysts saw oil
as a problem in coming months because of the Mideast crisis.
   The economists suggested that while exports may remain strong in
the second half of the year, oil is likely to drive up the cost of
imports as price hikes from the Middle East crisis are added to the
bill.
   The Commerce Department said the deficit dropped to $5.07
billion, a 34.7 percent decline from May's $7.77 billion and the
lowest since a $3.96 billion imbalance was posted in June 1983.
   Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, who had joined many
analysts earlier in predicting the deficit would drop below $100
million this year, was quick to note the record $34.29 billion in
exports.
   ``While the month-to-month figures can be erratic, the strong,
positive trend indicates increasing U.S. export competitiveness in
the world marketplace,'' he said.
   The 4.6 percent increase in exports included not only $500
million in aircraft shipments, but gains in other business capital
equipment as well.
   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, called the
exports ``good news'' since that sector ``was the only part of the
economy with any strength'' in June.
   Gilbert Benz, an economist at the Swiss Bank Corp. in New York,
said the figure will boost the second-quarter gross national
product which earlier had been estimated to have grown a meager 1.2
percent.
   ``It's the one component that might help us skate around a
recession in the second half of the year,'' Benz said.
   Imports declined 2.9 percent to $39.37 billion, helped by a $631
million drop in oil costs.
   Oil imports in June fell 14.6 percent to $3.69 billion.
Americans imported 8.40 million barrels a day, down from 8.95
billion in May.
   The deficit is the difference between imports and exports and,
for the first six months, was running at an annual rate of $91.62
billion. If it ended the year at that pace, it would be the first
deficit since 1983 under $100 billion.
   Analysts were quick, however, to toss in the Middle East caveat.
   ``The Persian Gulf crisis is already generating oil price
increases which likely will contribute to a worsening trade deficit
in the future,'' said John Howard, international finance director
at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``Unfortunately, the merchandise trade deficit has nowhere to go
but up,'' suggested Barry K. Rogstad, president of the American
Business Council. ``The price of oil is today nearly double what it
was in June. Had the current price prevailed in June, the deficit
would have widened by $3.5 billion.''
   Indeed, Commerce said the average price per barrel in June was
$14.64, compared with Thursday's $27.36 a barrel cost for the
benchmark West Texas crude.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was with Japan, a $3.1 billion
imbalance, up from a $3.0 billion deficit in May. Other deficits
included Taiwan, $900 million; China, $800 million; Canada, $700
million; Brazil, $300 million; Korea, $200 million, and Hong Kong,
$100 million.
   The United States posted a surplus with western Europe of $899
million.

   Moslem worshipers chanted pro-Iraqi slogans and
reportedly burned American flags after Friday noon prayers at
Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites.
   Riot police watched from rooftops but did not interfere. The
crowd dispersed peacefully after half an hour.
   In the West Bank village of Beit Furik, reporters said about 400
Palestinians bearing the likenesses of PLO leader Yasser Arafat and
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein chanted: ``Syrian President Hafez
Assad and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are cowards for
collaborating with the Americans!''
   The demonstrations were the latest in a series of rallies in the
occupied lands celebrating Saddam as the national savior of the
Palestinians and condemning those Arab leaders joining the Western
effort to stop Iraqi aggression.
   Both Egypt and Syria have denounced Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and sent troops to bolster the international force in Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam has always been liked by Palestinians for his aggressive
stand toward the West, but his popularity began to soar after he
said he would only pull out from Kuwait if the Israelis withdrew
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   About 10,000 worshipers attended noon prayers at Al Aqsa, which
stands beside the Dome of the Rock Mosque on Haram a-Sharif, the
site where Moslems believe the Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
The area is also venerated by the Jews as the site of the Jewish
Temple.
   In his sermon, the Al Aqsa preacher sharply criticized Saudi
Arabia for allowing American forces to land on its territory.
   ``The Arab leaders are giving Moslem lands to the Americans,''
he said. ``One day all Arab land will be in the hands of the
Americans. This land is for Moslems and not for Americans.''
   Saddam has tried to portray the gulf crisis as a jihad, or holy
war, between Moslems and infidels. Mecca, Islam's holiest site, is
in Saudi Arabia.
   Following the prayers, hundreds of worshipers carrying
Palestinian and Islamic flags chanted ``With our soul, with our
blood, we'll sacrifice for you, Saddam.''
   Reporters were confined to a rooftop overlooking parts of Haram
a-Sharif and could not see the Al Aqsa demonstrators.
   One of the protesters leaving the compound said American and
Israeli flags were burned. The crowd responded by whistling and
clapping, said the man, who would only give his first name, Jumma.
   Leaders of the anti-Israeli Palestinian uprising issued a
leaflet condemning pro-Western Arab states and declaring the ``full
support for the Iraqi people in confronting the imperialists.''
   The leaflet, distributed throughout the occupied lands, set
aside Saturday as a ``day of solidarity with Iraq through
demonstrating and marching in every place in our land.''
   The Israeli Peace Now movement condemned the Palestinian views
in an ad placed in newspapers.
   ``We are disappointed by the enthusiastic Palestinian support
for Saddam Hussein,'' the ad said. ``The path of Saddam Hussein is
the path of violence, threats and war. Support for him is support
for the resolution of disputes between nations through force.''

<TEXT>
   The son of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq
on Friday blamed ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto for the
mysterious plane crash that killed his father two years ago, but he
provided no proof.
   Ijaz ul-Haq called on the military-backed caretaker government
that replaced Ms. Bhutto to open a new investigation into the crash
on Aug. 17, 1988. It killed Zia, many of the country's top generals
and U.S. Ambassador Arnold Raphael.
   Ms. Bhutto's own father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was overthrown by
Zia in 1977 and hanged in 1979. She says Zia issued the execution
order.
   The anniversary of Zia's death came less than two weeks after
Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed on charges of corruption,
nepotism and ineptitude.
   Ms. Bhutto, who took power in November 1988, claims her ouster
was a coup camouflaged by use of constitutional powers.
   A technical inquiry found the crash that killed Zia was
sabotage, but a criminal investigation was never conducted.
   Ijaz, a 38-year-old banker, blamed Ms. Bhutto, her government
and her Pakistan People's Party, saying that through ``criminal
negligence'' it ``covered up any evidence.''
   ``The former prime minister and her ministers actually ridiculed
the tragedy, provided cover to the criminals and shut the door on
any investigation,'' said Ijaz, speaking at a news conference
following a brief memorial ceremony for his father. But he provided
no evidence to support his claims.
   Neither Ms. Bhutto nor her spokesmen could be reached for
comment, but they have dismissed similar allegations as baseless.
   Earlier, Ijaz promised to carry on Zia's dream of wielding an
Islamic federation stretching from the Soviet Central Asian
republics to western China.
   ``The dream is being fulfilled _ Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran,
Turkey,'' Ijaz told about 100,000 people who crowded onto the
sprawling grounds of the Faisal Mosque and climbed its sloping roof
and towering spires.
   ``A new movement, a new unity will start from here,'' Ijaz said.
``I swear by the grave of Zia ul-Haq.''
   With the abrupt change of government and uncertainty over the
future of democracy, many Pakistanis are remembering Zia's 11-year
military rule, despite its harshness, in a more favorable light.
Hundreds of people make the pilgrimage to Zia's grave daily.
   Elections are scheduled Oct. 24, but there has been speculation
they will be postponed and that another round of military rule is
in the works. The military has ruled Pakistan for more than half
its 43-year history.

   Doctors are ``uncertain but hopeful'' that
renewed radiation treatment this week of Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater's brain tumor will halt its spread, a party
official says.
   Doctors at George Washington University Hospital administered
the treatment Wednesday after discovering that his tumor had
worsened, according to a statement Thursday from GOP chief of staff
Mary Matalin.
   ``Doctors are uncertain but hopeful of a positive response to
the treatment,'' Ms. Matalin said.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said President Bush is ``greatly concerned about Lee.''
   The treatment was the first since Atwater, 39, received a
radioactive implant April 3 at Montefiore Hospital in New York. He
had been re-hospitalized Aug. 2 in Washington after running a fever.
   At the time, a GOP spokesman said ``the tumor is dying.''
   But in the statement released Thursday, Ms. Matalin said:
   ``This week Lee underwent another diagnostic procedure at George
Washington University Hospital under the supervision of Dr. Edward
Laws, professor and chairman of neurosurgery at George Washington.
   ``Dr. Laws reported the biopsy `indicated tumor progression
requiring additional treatment.'''
   Leslie Goodman, Atwater's press secretary, said Atwater was not
in intensive care. She said she did not know additional details
about the radiation treatment.
   Atwater remains ``alert, focused and as determined as ever to
continue his battle,'' Ms. Matalin's statement said.
   Ms. Goodman said she did not know whether Atwater was able to
walk or whether doctors had given a prognosis for his recovery.
   Atwater collapsed before a speech in March and received
radiation treatment after doctors determined that his brain tumor
was inoperable. He also has been receiving physical therapy.
   President Bush visited Atwater in the hospital last week.
   Charles Black, a Republican consultant and friend of Atwater,
has been picked to be the party's chief spokesman during the
chairman's illness.

   President Bush today protested
attempts to move Americans trapped in Iraq or Kuwait ``against
their will.'' The White House said Bush was considering a selective
call-up of reserves to meet the military's needs for doctors and
other specialists.
   U.S. ship commanders got orders to intercept all ships carrying
goods to or from Iraq, but so far have not had to stop any vessels,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   The Pentagon has asked Bush to call up reserves and Fitzwater
said, ``We'll try to keep this to the smallest possible.'' It is
likely to be limited to calling up reservists who are doctors,
cargo handlers and other specialists in short supply.
   U.S. officials are still trying to find out where the Iraqis
have taken some 38 Americans removed from the Rashid Hotel in
Baghdad, Fitzwater said. They are believed to have been taken to
another hotel.
   ``Iraqi officials have told us they were safe, but have not
given us any explanation as to why they were moved or where they
are,'' the spokesman said.
   In Washington, the State Department reported U.S. diplomats had
been prevented from entering another hotel, the Melia Monsour, to
see if the Americans had been moved there.
   ``Clearly, we are very seriously concerned about the
Americans,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   Boucher also reported that food available to Americans on open
markets in Iraq and Kuwait was diminishing.
   On the 2,500 Americans trapped behind Iraqi lines in Kuwait,
Fitzwater said, ``There are not signs that anyone has been rounded
up in Kuwait, no signs of harassment.'' He said the Americans
appeared to be ignoring an Iraqi call Thursday for Americans and
other foreigners to gather in various hotels.
   In fact, the State Department said today only five Americans
responded to the order, and when they got to the hotel they found
no Iraqi officials. Boucher said the Iraqis did not repeat the
demand today.
   On criticism from United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez
de Cuellar that the United States may be overstepping its bounds in
enforcing the naval blockage against Iraq, Fitzwater said, ``We
obviously believe that Article 51 authorizes our intercept
activities. We believe the U.N. understands that.''
   Asked if the United States considered the moving of the
Americans from the Rashid Hotel an act of provocation, Fitzwater
said, ``We consider it a matter of serious concern.''
   He said it is not known when Bush will decide whether to call up
reserves. Fitzwater previously has noted that Bush has the
authority to call up to 200,000 reserves for 180 days.
   But the spokesman said he did not expect ``any massive call-up.''
   ``In recent years, Congress has allocated more and more of the
support functions for the military to the reserve forces, so that
you find a major aspect of our support in terms of cargo handlers
and doctors and medical specialists and so forth are in the
reserves,'' he said.
   ``The president has not made a decision on this yet, but he is
looking at certain specialized categories that would be necessary
to support the effort in the gulf,'' he said.
   Bush will return to the White House Sunday night and meet Monday
morning with budget aides and Energy Secretary James Watkins. The
session with Watkins is to discuss the impact of the Persian Gulf
crisis on U.S. energy reserves. Bush will address the Veterans of
Foreign War convention in Baltimore later Monday as previously
planned.
   Bush, who put in a pre-dawn call to the White House situation
room, said ``there was nothing new'' with the Americans in Kuwait.
   Asked what would happen if they were taken to Iraq, Bush said,
``I don't think anybody ought to be moved against their will in
contravention of international law.''
   He also said ``the Japanese were told that they cannot leave''
the country.
   Iraqi's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
today repeated his assurances that the Americans in Iraq and Kuwait
wouldn't be harmed. Interviewed in ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
Al-Mashat said, ``I can assure you they are well treated and will
be released in due time.''
   Bush on Thursday signed the order instructing U.S. ship
commanders in the Middle East to intercept ships carrying goods to
or from Iraq or Kuwait, including shipments through Aqaba. ``To the
maximum extent possible we will conduct operations without the use
of force,'' the president's order said.
   A Pentagon source said earlier that those steps could include
attempting to block the ship's passage or firing a warning shot
across the bow.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was bound for Riyadh today to
visit American troops standing guard in the Saudi desert against a
possible further thrust by Iraq's Saddam Hussein, whose troops
overran Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The unprecedented deployment of U.S. military ground and air
power in strategic areas of Saudi Arabia continued today with the
unloading of tanks and other heavy equipment and arms. U.S. Marines
are rapidly building to a force of 45,000 in the Middle East _
almost a quarter of their whole strength.
   Bush, after spending more than two hours with Jordan's King
Hussein on Thursday, said, ``I can't say I am satisfied, but what I
am is encouraged'' that Jordan intends to abide by the United
Nations sanctions against Iraq.
   King Hussein's brother, Crown Prince Hassan, said on CBS ``This
Morning'' that ``His majesty made it clear (to Bush) that we will
adhere to the U.N. resolution.''
   Pentagon sources said the Marines are building to a force of
45,000 to counter an Iraqi army now believed to have grown to
160,000 in overrun Kuwait. American military planners are preparing
to put 250,000 soldiers on the ground if necessary.
   The U.S. Navy already has massed 27 ships, including three
carriers, in the gulf, the nearby Arabian Sea and the Red Sea.
   The Pentagon put its first public price tag on Operation Desert
Shield: nearly $1.2 billion for just the first 7{ weeks. The
Pentagon said it could give no figure beyond Sept. 30 because the
size and role of the U.S. forces ``are still evolving.''

   President Bush says he enjoys country
music because it is ``real people singing real stories that we all
can understand.''
   In an essay in the September issue of Country America magazine
entitled ``Why I Love Country Music,'' he says he hears a love for
America in country lyrics. ``You can hear it in the line for the
Lee Greenwood song that we all love: `And I'm proud to be an
American, where at least I know I'm free . . .' '' Bush says.
   ``In a world where people everywhere are marching toward liberty
and democracy, Lee's important message reminds us how blessed we
are to be citizens of the country that stands as a model for so
many others,'' he wrote.
   ``That's what country music comes down to: real people singing
real stories that we can all understand.''
   Bush has stereo speakers built into his desk in the White House
office and says he listens to a Washington country music station.
   ``I find myself more relaxed with Reba (McEntire) coming over
the airwaves,'' the president wrote.
   Country America magazine is published by the Des Moines-based
Meredith Corp., which also publishes Better Homes and Gardens and
Ladies' Homes Journal magazines.

   Mickey Rooney Jr. has endured some
false starts in his career, but the autobiography he's writing and
a couple of new country songs might give him break he's been hoping
for.
   He remains cautious, even though his songs ``It Takes a Good
Girl to Get Me'' and ``There's No Easy Way Out of This Love'' have
been greeted enthusiastically by record companies in Nashville.
   ``The people there are very interested,'' he said, adding he
expected to sign a recording deal in a few weeks.
   But he's quick to temper his optimism, citing past experiences.
   ``I've had eight record deals since I was a kid and it never
went anywhere. I had no record company support,'' he said.
   The oldest of Mickey Rooney's 10 children, he resisted those who
suggested he change his name to distance himself from his famous
father.
   ``My father wanted me to change my name, but I like it,'' Rooney
said. ``He loves me. He loves my career. But he hasn't been too
thrilled about what doesn't happen with my career.
   ``This is a luxury trade, show business. If you hit, you're

   The National Enquirer has asked a federal judge
to dismiss a $12 million lawsuit filed by the father of model Marla
Maples.
   The suit, filed against the tabloid by Stan Maples, is seeking
damages for defamation, invasion of privacy and commercial
appropriation as a result of an April 10 Enquirer article about his
daughter's relationship with New York developer Donald Trump.
   In a motion filed this week in U.S. District Court in Rome, the
Florida-based tabloid contends its article about Ms. Maples and her
father did not defame Stan Maples or subject him to ``public
hatred, contempt or ridicule.''
   ``The statements and questions attributed to plaintiff would not
be highly offensive to a reasonable person, even if they were
false,'' according to the motion, asking for dismissal of the suit.
   It said the passages cited in Maples' complaint ``uniformly
portray him as a concerned and supportive father.''

   Federal army units moved into the
streets of a town in Croatia today amid rising tension over plans
to ban a referendum on Serb autonomy in the republic, the state
news agency reported.
   The Tanjug news agency said the army took up positions in the
Croatian town of Knin at 6:30 p.m. local time, less than 30 minutes
after the mayor declared a ``state of war.''
   Earlier, army jets intercepted three Croatian government
helicopters and forced them to return to their bases, Tanjug
reported. The army is dominated by Serbs, traditional rivals of
Croatians.
   The unprecedented army moves in the air and in Knin followed
requests for assistance in dealing with Interior Ministry armored
vehicles heading toward the town of Obrovac, where large crowds had
gathered.
   The news agency did not say who had asked for the army's help
and what kind of assistance was requested.
   `In Obrovac and Benkovac, large crowds of citizens are in the
streets, hindering and stoppic traffic,'' Tanjug said, citing a
statement by the Croatian Interior Ministry.
   The news agency also reported that hundreds of Serbs living in
Croatia, infuriated that authorities planned to ban an unofficial
referendum on Serb autonomy within Croatia, broke into a police
station in the town of Grachc.
   While the statement did not specify to which ethnic group the
demonstrators in Obrovac and Benkovac belonged, they appeared to be
Serbs angered by the ban.
   Croatian authorities earlier today vowed to prevent the
unofficial referendum, saying it was aimed at undermining
democratic reforms in Croatia.
   Leaders of the 400,000-strong Serb minority in western Croatia
had been scheduled to start a two-week referendum Sunday in which
Serbs were to choose whether they want some degree of
self-government within Croatia.
   Serbia and Croatia have been traditional rivals since they were
united within Yugoslavia in 1918. Serbs say hundreds of thousands
of their compatriots were murdered in Croatia in World War II by
Nazi-like Croatian nationalists.
   Serbs in Croatia claim they are being systematically
discriminated against by what they allege are extremists in the
Croatian Democratic Union, a center-right political party which
last spring overwhelmingly won the first free elections in Croatia
in over 50 years.
   The Serbs are strongly supported by the state-run media in
neighboring Serbia, in which the Communist party has refused to
hold western-style elections and has described the CDU government
as ``fascist and racist.''
   Croatian authorities have said the planned ballot is not legal
because it is unclear who is organizing it and because Croats
living in the Serbian region will be denied the right to
participate.
   Croatia's new government advocates turning the Yugoslav
federation into a loose association of semi-independent states in
which national minorities would be guaranteed full political and
national rights.

   A group of nine foreigners,
including three Americans, bolted across the Kuwaiti desert to this
border town today in an effort to avoid an Iraqi order to gather at
a downtown hotel.
   ``No one responded to the Iraqi call, as far as I know, but
everyone is making a rush to get out of Kuwait,'' said Stephanie
McGehee, an American stringer for The Associated Press who was in
the group.
   Contact with Ms. McGehee was lost two days after the Aug. 2
invasion as the Iraqis gradually cut off all telephone and telex
lines.
   On Thursday, Iraqi military authorities ordered Britons and
Americans to assemble at Kuwait hotels, but then failed to turn up
to meet them. There are 4,000 Britons and 2,500 Americans in Kuwait.
   Ms. McGehee, speaking from a telephone booth for only a couple
of minutes at the Saudi border post of Khafji, said she escaped
along with two other Americans, a Briton, a Canadian and four
Indians.
   She said she had heard that only two Britons showed up at the
Regency Palace hotel in response to the Iraqi order and were told,
``We have no room for you, stay in the ballroom.''
   ``We believe it was all only an Iraqi show, but everyone is
trying to get out,'' she said.
   The group included both men and women.
   Ms. McGehee said that in order to escape, she and the others had
all dressed as Kuwaitis. Since she spoke Arabic she sat next to the
driver. She carried the identity card of a Lebanese friend.
   ``As soon as we left the paved road, we ran into Iraqis and they
said we had to go back,'' she said. ``We moved away and then took
another turn through the desert sands and made a dash for it,'' she
said.
   ``It was very, very terrifying,'' she added.
   McGehee identified the Canadian with her as Kathy McGregor.
   Other travelers who reached Khafji today said that a a Kuwaiti
woman was shot in the foot in one of the latest convoys of escaping
nationals.
   The travelers were quoted by friends in Bahrain as saying that
the incident occurred when a convoy of 11 cars was crossing the
border Thursday night. They said the Iraqis began shooting at the
convoy as it sped across the border at Khafji. They did not know
how the woman was injured.

   One thousand Iranian prisoners of war
returned home to an ecstatic welcome Friday, part of the Iraqi
campaign to settle the war with its eastern neighbor and focus on
the escalating confrontation with the United States.
   Iraqi troops also started pulling back from the Iranian border.
   The first batch of prisoners arrived in the Iranian border town
of Qasr-e-Shirin just after noon. ``We welcome your blessed
arrival,'' said President Hashemi Rafsanjani in a message.
   Tehran radio called on all Iranians to go to their rooftops and
together shout ``God is great!'' to give thanks.
   Tehran Television, monitored in Nicosia, showed hundreds of
jubilant soldiers mingling with friends and relatives clamoring to
embrace and kiss the freed prisoners. Men carrying boxes of sweets
stuffed goodies into the mouths of the arriving POWs, the
traditional Iranian manner of celebration.
   A shopkeeper broke down and wept with joy when asked how he felt.
   Another shopkeeper, asked why the shelves of his confectionary
were empty, replied: ``People are happy, and I am happy. Today, we
eat sweets.''
   As the first batch of ex-prisoners arrived home, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Tehran would repatriate an equal number of
Iraqi prisoners. Tehran radio said the Iraqi POWs had been
dispatched to the border to complete formalities.
   These include being interviewed individually by the Red Cross to
guarantee no prisoner is sent home against his will.
   Iraq said it would release all Iranian POWs in daily batches of
1,000 starting Friday, the most the Red Cross can cope with at one
time. No deadline was set for the completion of the release.
   The Red Cross has registered about 19,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq
and about 50,000 Iraqis in Iran. The United Nations estimates that
both sides actually hold more than 100,000.
   Tehran Radio interrupted its normal morning program to announce
that Iraqi troops had begun withdrawing from Iranian territory. It
said Iranian officers monitoring the development reported the
withdrawal got under way at 5 a.m.
   Morteza Sarmadi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, reported 10
hours later that the Iraqis had withdrawn from 164 square miles of
Iranian territory in the Ilam region, on the central sector of the
Iran-Iraq border.
   Iran says Iraq occupies more than 773 square miles of its land.
The United Nations says the size of the occupied area is half of
that.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said he hopes to complete
within five days the withdrawal from territories occupied in the
closing weeks of the Iran-Iraq war. A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire
took effect Aug. 20, 1988, but peace talks stalled immediately
afterward over disagreement on various issues, particularly control
of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway along the countries' border.
   On Wednesday, Saddam agreed to drop demands for full control of
the waterway and made other concessions to Iran to end their
differences. He promised to begin withdrawing troops from occupied
territory in Iran and returning POWs.
   Neutralizing the border with Iran allows Saddam to focus on the
conflict with the United States and its Western and Arab allies,
triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The withdrawal from Iranian territory frees some 300,000 Iraqi
troops who could then be sent south to Kuwait to face the military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   Iran has criticized Iraq's occupation and annexation of Kuwait.
But it also has attacked the U.S.-led Western intervention in the
Persian Gulf.
   In a prayer sermon in Tehran on Friday, Iran's former chief
justice, Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili, called on Saddam to defuse the
crisis before a confrontation with the United States.
   ``If you (Saddam) withdraw, the imperialists will have no
pretext for starting a war.
   ``If the United States gets a foothold in the region, it will
never leave,'' Ardebili said in the sermon broadcast by Tehran
Radio.
   Before now, repatriations of POWs had been largely limited to
the sick, wounded or aged. Angelo Gnaedinger, the Red Cross chief
delegate for the Middle East, said a total of 969 Iranians and
1,343 Iraqis had been repatriated before Friday. He said both sides
were known to hold more of these hardship cases.

   ABC's Sam Donaldson accidentally violated
Pentagon rules by specifying the location of an air base used by
U.S. warplanes in Saudi Arabia and got a warning from his U.S
military escort, an ABC official said Friday.
   ``He made an honest mistake,'' ABC News vice president Robert
Murphy said.
   It occurred Wednesday night during his live ``Nightline'' report
from the air base in Saudi Arabia.
   ABC said a tape of his report, with the location bleeped out,
aired Thursday night on ``PrimeTime Live,'' which Donaldson
co-anchors with Diane Sawyer.
   Under U.S. press pool rules for print and broadcast reporters in
Saudi Arabia, no locations of military bases used by U.S. forces
can be given in journalists' reports.
   Murphy said Donaldson, who went on ``Nightline'' shortly after
arriving in Saudi Arabia, ``hadn't been briefed on the ground
rules.''
   After a warning from his military escort, Donaldson then was
given a full tour of the military base, Murphy said. He said ABC
got no complaints from the U.S. government.
   Donaldson told viewers Thursday night that he had ``made the
mistake of saying exactly where I am, and it turns out that's a
no-no, and so we had to bleep it out. It's not that this is such a
secret location. . . . It's that the Saudis are so sensitive about
the (U.S.) troops being here that they simply don't want the
location published.''

<TEXT>
   East Germany's secret police recruited and
paid 14-year-old children to spy and inform on dissident groups
under the country's old Communist government, an East Berlin
newspaper reported Friday.
   Der Morgen newspaper said that former secret police chief Erich
Mielke personally ordered that ``operatives should be chosen from
among the 14- and 15-year-olds,'' to spy on dissidents in East
Germany.
   The newspaper cited a secret police document from the East
German city of Leipzig.
   The secret police force, or Stasi as it was known, has been
dismantled since the fall of the Communist government in last
fall's revolution.
   According to reports emerging since then, one of every eight of
the country's 16.1 million citizens worked at some point for the
Stasi.
   Several high-ranking East German politicians were forced to
resign from their posts following rumors or disclosures that they
had worked for the dreaded Stasi.
   The most recent official accused of having close Stasi contacts
is Martin Kirchner, secretary-general of Prime Minister Lothar de
Maiziere's Christian Democratic Union party.
   Kirchner has been suspended from his post pending an
investigation. He has denied reports he worked for the secret
police over a 15-year period.

   Federal prosecutors said today they will
appeal a judge's order that a doctor abducted in the Enrique
Camarena murder case be returned to Mexico.
   A motion was filed for a stay pending appeal in the case of Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain, saying they believed the judge had
committed ``several clear errors of law.''
   The brief also said U.S. authorities would have ``virtually no
chance'' of getting Alvarez back into custody if he is repatriated.
   However, U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie told prosecutors
that the stay was unnecessary because they planned to file the
appeal later in the day. He also set an Aug. 24 bail hearing for
Alvarez.
   A week ago, Rafeedie ruled that the U.S. abducted Alvarez in
violation of an extradition treaty with Mexico, that the kidnapping
was an offense to Mexico's sovereignty, and that his court lacked
jurisdiction to try the physician.
   Alvarez was charged with violent crimes in aid of racketeering,
conspiracy, kidnap and murder in the slaying of Camarena, a U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration agent who was killed in 1985. He is
accused of administering drugs to keep Camarena, 31, alive while he
was being tortured.
   The doctor, who faces a possible life prison term if convicted,
was spirited out of Mexico in April, and the Mexican government
strongly protested the action.
   In hearings on the issue, the DEA acknowledged it had paid
$20,000 in DEA funds plus $6,000 a week in expenses to people who
brought Alvarez to the United States to face charges.

<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan, the
only black in President Bush's Cabinet, journeyed to Bush's
oceanfront home Friday for talks aimed at averting a veto of a
major civil rights bill.
   Sullivan and Constance Newman, director of the Office of
Personnel Management, met with Bush, White House chief of staff
John Sununu and counsel C. Boyden Gray to discuss the job
discrimination bill that passed the House and Senate in the last
month.
   Reporters were not allowed onto Bush's Walker's Point compound
to question Sullivan or the other participants in the meeting.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater reiterated Bush's threat
to veto the legislation unless it is changed in a House-Senate
conference. The Bush administration has said the bill would force
employers to resort to hiring quotas for minorities in order to
avoid job discrimination suits.
   Sununu has spearheaded repeated efforts to negotiate a
compromise with Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and civil rights
groups backing the Democratic-crafted measure, which would reverse
a string of five Supreme Court rulings in 1989 that narrowed
protection against job bias.
   Civil rights groups deny that the bill would force quotas, and
they have been unwilling to accept the White House's ``corrective''
language.
   ``We are still hopeful that we can get some changes,'' said
Fitzwater. But he added, ``There's no change in our veto threat.''
   While Sullivan has not been involved in those negotiations,
Fitzwater said that in addition to running a huge government
department with major civil rights responsibilities, Sullivan ``is
a black man and has very strong personal interests and concerns in
this bill.''
   He called Sullivan ``a leader in the civil rights movement for
many years (who) feels very strongly about this issue and he simply
wants to talk to the president about it.''
   Newman is also one of Bush's highest ranking black appointees.
   In Washington, Campbell Gardett, a spokesman for the Department
of Health and Human Services, said Sullivan was searching for ways
``to get Congress and the black community to work together to get
legislation the president can sign.''
   Gardett said Sullivan shares Bush's concern about quotas.
   The House approved the bill 272-154 on Aug. 3 and the Senate
passed the measure 65-34 on July 18. Both were less than the
two-thirds margin needed to override a veto.
   Congress has failed to override any of the 13 vetoes Bush has
cast.

   Roving bands with makeshift
shields, guns and spears rampaged through Soweto and other black
townships Friday, clashing in sporadic battles that have killed 183
people in six days.
   Police in armored vehicles rolled over streets barricaded with
boulders and burning cars. They used tear gas to disperse shouting
mobs and fired shotguns at combatants fleeing through narrow
shantytown streets.
   Police said at least 31 people had been killed and 217 injured
in two days of savage hand-to-hand fighting in Soweto, South
Africa's largest black township.
   The fighting pits Zulu supporters of the conservative Inkatha
movement against mostly Xhosa members of the African National
Congress, led by Nelson Mandela.
   The ANC accused the government's security forces of plotting to
use the Zulu-based Inkatha party to stir up tribal rivalry in the
townships.
   More than 5,000 people have died in fighting between Inkatha and
ANC supporters in the eastern Natal province in the past five years.
   Their bloody conflict spread to the township of Thokoza east of
Johannesburg on Sunday, and later to four more areas, including
Soweto, southwest of Johannesburg.
   Groups of up to 100 armed men waved sticks, knives, bayonets and
shields fashioned of trash-can lids as they marched. Most of the
combatants were Zulu migrant workers from the Inkatha stronghold of
Natal, or Xhosa residents of Soweto.
   On Friday afternoon, hundreds of Inkatha supporters moved out of
their compounds and stood on the railway track with guns and
sticks, waiting for the trains to bring black commuters home from
Johannesburg, the South African Press Association reported.
   Police and residents also reported looting, random
gasoline-bombing of homes and indiscriminate gang attacks on
individuals. A family of six, including a 5-month-old baby and
three other children, were badly burned when someone threw a
firebomb into their shack in Kagiso township, north of Soweto.
   The ANC said state security forces, in collusion with Inkatha,
were trying to ``spread a climate of fear and terror'' in towns
that are ANC strongholds.
   ``They want to provoke a mass backlash among blacks and whites
in support of tough repressive measures by the government in order
to undermine the process towards peace,'' the ANC statement said.
   The spreading unrest led to an unscheduled meeting Thursday
between President F.W. de Klerk and Mandela, who have been holding
discussions to clear the way for formal negotiations on ending
white minority rule.
   Inkatha President Mangosuthu Buthelezi said ANC supporters
``frequently insult, denigrate and attack Inkatha members on the
trains, in the buses, and other places.'' He said that had sparked
the conflict.
   Buthelezi, making his statement in Ulundi in Natal province,
said Inkatha was committed to democracy and opposed to violence.
But he said ``until respect for one another is observed, it will be
difficult to obtain peace.''
   Many Zulus involved in the fighting said they would not accept
Mandela and the ANC as a future government.
   Free-lance photographer Sabastian Balic described one killing at
a migrant workers hostel in Soweto on Friday.
   ``When I arrived, there was a crowd around outside the
dormitory. They were poking through the windows with these spikes
trying to get this person to come out,'' he said. The crowd
eventually broke the lock and kicked the door in, he said.
   ``I could hear sounds of fighting inside. The person broke free
and ran outside. He must have made 50 yards before he was brought
down,'' said Balic.
   ``Then the crowd laid into him with axes. I would say a blow
with an axe to the head killed him. It opened up his skull. The
people were just stabbing and hitting him on the ground for three
minutes.''
   When it was over, the Zulu crowd searched the man's pockets,
found his identity book and his name _ Sandile Gugudu. ``He's a
Xhosa,'' they said.
   Then a police van drove by, and they scattered.

   The Security Council today expressed
``concern and anxiety'' over the fate of foreigners trapped in
Kuwait and Iraq and asked the secretary-general to take all
necessary steps to help them.
   The statement was made by Council President Aurel Dragos
Munteanu of Romania after a closed council session.
   ``The members of the council express their concern and anxiety
over the situation of foreign nationals in Kuwait and Iraq and ask
the secretary-general to take all steps considered appropriate,''
he said.
   Several thousand Americans and Britons were ordered to hotels in
Kuwait on Thursday and at least 35 Americans were removed today
from a hotel in Baghdad.
   Earlier today, a three-country committee, in closed session,
discussed an interim report on compliance with an embargo on Iraq
by more than 40 of the 159 member states. It also was expected to
discuss violations and enforcement, but was not expected to call
for a U.N. blockade at this time.
   The committee, headed by Finland and joined by Colombia and
Canada, also was consulting with the rest of the 15-member council.
   Perez deany blockade has to have U.N. Security Council approval.
   ``As long as that is not the case,'' he said, ``any
intervention, whatever the country, would not be in accordance with
the letter or spirit of the United Nations Charter.''
   Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian, returned to his homeland on a
visit.
   The Soviet Union has been pressing for a broader U.N. role in
controlling regional conflicts and has said it would only
participate in a military operation in the Persian Gulf under the
U.N. flag.
   The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Though the embargo is intended to be binding, U.N.
members voted no specific measures to enforce it.
   Thirty-two of the 159 U.N. members had filed compliance reports
by Wednesday, and all were honoring the sanctions. A full U.N.
report is due by the end of the month.
   Jordan, which allows its port of Aqaba to supply Iraq, did not
respond. Jordanian diplomats declined comment.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council met
privately Thursday to discuss Iraq's order that Americans and
Britons in Kuwait assemble in hotels.
   Iraq ordered the gathering because of what they called
unspecified threats. In Washington, the U.S. State Department said
it was protesting the order.
   Diplomats had said the five permanent Security Council members _
the United States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union _
also were discussing the situation of those already detained.
   Also Thursday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, in a letter to the
U.N. chief, called for an emergency Security Council meeting in
Geneva to remove U.S. forces. There was no decision on a meeting,
but consultations were under way.
   Gadhafi said U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia should be replaced by
Arab League forces and U.S. naval personnel in the Persian Gulf
should be replaced by U.N. forces.

   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Friday
the Soviet Union would send troops to the Persian Gulf if the
United Nations calls for a multinational military force to solve
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Shevardnadze's statement took the Soviet Union one step closer
to agreement with the United States on an armed, united front to
halt Iraqi aggression. It could put American and Soviet soldiers on
the same side for the first time since World War II.
   Meanwhile, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev accused former ally
Iraq of ``treachery'' in using Soviet-provided weapons to seize
Kuwait. He called for international cooperation to keep the
conflict from becoming ``a full-scale military confrontation.''
   The Soviet Union was Iraq's major weapons supplier for more than
a decade, providing it with modern jet fighters and licensing an
entire factory for building its top-of-the-line T-72 tank.
   Moscow halted arms shipments to Iraq the day after the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and joined the United States in a call for
a worldwide arms embargo. However, the Kremlin refused to join a
U.S.-led multinational military force against the Iraqis.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said last
week that if the United Nations approved a military force, ``then
we would think about it and would take our own sovereign decision
about what to do.''
   ``At this stage, we do not consider the possibilty of
participating in either the international force or naval
blockade,'' the spokesman said then.
   On Friday, correspondents crowded around Shevardnadze at a press
conference to ask if Soviet troops would be sent to the gulf.
   ``Yes, if there is a decision by the Security Council,''
Shevardnadze said.
   He would not say how the Soviet Union would vote on such a
proposal in the U.N. Security Council. But he said, ``If the Soviet
Union votes for that decision, it certainly will take part.''
   Gorbachev told Soviet military men in Odessa on Friday that
Iraqi use of Soviet weapons to attack Kuwait gave the Soviet Union
a special responsibility to solve the crisis.
   ``We have witnessed an act of treachery,'' he said in remarks
carried by the official news agency Tass.
   Iraq's action was ``a violation of everything the world
community now pins its hopes on as it seeks to put civilization on
the tracks of peaceful development,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``The use of force to redraw borders, especially in order to
annex a sovereign country, threatens a perilous chain reaction
endangering the whole world community,'' said the Soviet president.
   Shevardnadze said he was discussing the gulf crisis with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III almost daily by telephone.
   The Soviet foreign minister laid heavy emphasis on U.S.-Soviet
agreement to revive a U.N. military staff committee under the
jurisdiction of the Security Council. American officials said
earlier such a committee would coordinate the defense of the U.S.,
British, French and other warships in the gulf should they come
under Iraqi fire.
   U.S. officials also have said the Soviet Union suggested the
warships carry a U.N. flag.
   ``When this staff committee is created, the military should get
together and determine what collective action is needed: Should
force be used or not? That should be determined at an expert level
_ what measures and what actions are needed,'' the foreign minister
said.
   In answer to a Kuwaiti reporter's question on whether the Soviet
Union would concede to Iraq's demand for closure of all embassies
in Kuwait, Shevardnadze said he wants to avoid such action.

   President Hosni Mubarak said Friday
there is still time to find a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf
conflict and appealed to his Iraqi ``brothers'' to steer away from
confrontation and bloodshed.
   Mubarak has spearheaded Arab diplomatic efforts to defuse the
crisis, which began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I made so many contacts to several mediators to find a
peaceful solution,'' the Egyptian president told reporters. ``I
reached nothing.''
   But he said he would continue his efforts and hoped others would
do the same.
   ``I am calling our brothers in Iraq to respond to the voice of
peace, to avoid confrontation and bloodshed which may take place in
case of being obstinate,'' said Mubarak, who spoke after a meeting
on the crisis with three European Community foreign ministers.
   The Egyptian leader mediated contacts between Iraq and Kuwait
just before the invasion and gathered Arab League nations for an
emergency summit eight days after Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   Mubarak has been the target of Saddam's wrath for sending
Egyptian troops to join the multinational force deployed to defend
Saudi Arabia from further Iraqi aggression. He was the first Arab
leader to send a contingent.
   But Mubarak said he hoped to avoid a military clash with Iraq.
   ``We must not reach the edge of the abyss. War and its
consequences are very bad, so let's give a chance to whoever can
mediate,'' he said.
   Mubarak said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi had sent him a
message urging that foreign forces in the region come under a
United Nations umbrella. He said he agreed a U.N.-headed force
would be better than separate forces.
   Mubarak said the Egyptian force in Saudi Arabia would probably
number no more than 2,000 men and said it, like Moroccan and Syrian
contingents, would come under Saudi command.
   But figures from military sources had placed the number of
Egyptian troops already deployed at about 4,000, and another group
is scheduled to leave next week.
   The Arab troops were deployed after Arab League nations held
their summit in Cairo a week ago. A dozen of the 20 members present
voted to send troops.
   Mubarak was asked about U.S. moves to monitor shipping in the
Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea, both adjacent to Egypt, which
Washington says is necessary to enforce the U.N.-approved economic
embargo against Iraq.
   ``I am with the international embargo,'' he said. ``It may put
us in a position to avoid all confrontations.''
   The Egyptian president said he hoped Saddam would act more
speedily to settle the Kuwait conflict than he did in seeking peace
with Iran.
   Eight years of fighting between Iraq and Iran ended in 1988.
Saddam announced a peace initiative this week, and Iraq on Friday
began pulling out of Iranian territory it had seized and
repatriating prisoners of war.
   ``I hope with all my heart that ... we don't have to wait so
many years for Kuwait,'' Mubarak said.

   This usually lonely patch of air is
suddenly buzzing with the hum of faraway crisis.
   The ocean below is empty except for the shadows of clouds. Five
miles above, the sky is filled with planes. Echelons of thirsty
dart-shaped fighters chase matronly tanker planes loaded with fuel.
Radio channels crackle with curt instructions.
   The deployment of U.S. military air power to the Middle East has
turned the skies off the East Coast into busy service station
stops, where fighters hook up to transport planes for a fill-up at
530 mph.
   ``There's considerably increased activity in tanking
operations,'' said Lt. Col. George Peck, a spokesman for the
Strategic Air Command, which operates the Air Force tankers. ``It
is an integral part of this operation.''
   The increased activity was obvious from aboard a KC-135 tanker
based at the Plattsburgh, N.Y., Air Force Base which took part in a
refueling operation Thursday.
   The tanker was one of 16 from Plattsburgh, Griffiss Air Force
Base in New York and Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire that
formed an air bridge across the empty ocean for a flight of 24 F-4
Phantom fighters.
   Pairs of tankers, called cells, could be seen spread across the
horizon. Each plane was followed by three fighters.
   ``It was a big operation,'' said the captain who piloted the
tanker, a military cousin of the old 707 airliner. ``Three cells
were operating pretty close in the same area and we were hearing on
the radio of other cells coming up. It was a continuous operation.''
   The captain, whose name was not disclosed for security reasons,
said it was an example of what the tankers can do.
   ``That's what our job is. We can get where we need to be, unload
the gas and let the bombers, fighters and cargo airplanes go off
and do their mission,'' she said.
   The increase in military air activity has had only slight impact
on commercial air travel.
   ``There have been minor delays in some traffic, but not any big
disruptions,'' said Jo Ann Sloane, a spokeswoman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The tankers in Thursday's mission traveled across New England to
a point 190 miles east of Cape Cod where they rendezvoused with the
day's ``receivers,'' a squadron of fighters taking off from Seymour
Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina.
   The F-4G Phantoms, based at George Air Force Base outside Los
Angeles, were ``Wild Weasels,'' specially equipped with electronics
and armaments for the dangerous task of disrupting and destroying
enemy radar and anti-aircraft installations.
   The gleaming white missiles under their wings highlighted the
fact this was no practice mission.
   Inside the hot, noisy tanker, which flew its first mission
before any of its crew was born, an airman first class took her
position in the tail of the plane, lying on a platform to maneuver
the 20-foot refueling boom into a port just behind the fighter's
canopy.
   She nursed the jet into place with brief directions over the
radio and a series of red, green and white directional signals
flashing from the tanker's belly.
   ``With this many planes operating in the area, you don't want to
have a lot of chatter,'' she explained.
   She repeated the delicate maneuvers for more than an hour,
loading three fighters with 900 gallons of JP-4 fuel, then adding
another 400 gallons to top off the fighters' already emptying fuel
tanks.
   The process, which covered another 560 miles to the east, is
known in Air Force slang as ``dragging them across the pond.''
   When the job was done, the KC-135, turned for home. Other
tankers were waiting to escort the fighters the rest of the way
across the ocean.
   ``Good journey,'' said the boom operator as the fighters veered
away. Their mission done, there was little emotion over the
prospect of where the fighters were headed.
   ``We train to do this all the time,'' said the boom operator.
``But it makes it a little more urgent when it's the real thing.''

   The Miss America Pageant Organization
ordered Texas pageant officials to investigate allegations that
their longtime chief executive has a history of making lewd remarks
to contestants, a newspaper reported today.
   The Press said the pageant organization's executive director,
Leonard Horn, ordered the Miss Texas Scholarship Pageant to
investigate B. Don Magness after Life magazine quoted Magness as
yelling, ``Come on in, sluts!'' to a group of Miss Texas
contestants, and with making other sexually pointed comments.
   Texas Pageant President Barry Hall hopes to deliver the results
of the investigation to Horn by the end of next week, the newspaper
reported.
   Magness did not return telephone calls to his office earlier
this week and again this morning. He told the magazine he made sexy
comments only in jest.
   The 70th edition of the pageant will be held Sept. 8. In
Magness' 20 years at the helm of the Texas pageants, its winner has
been among the 10 finalists in Atlantic City 17 times.
   Jonna Fitzgerald, Miss Texas 1985, told the newspaper she
modeled swimsuits alone for Magness and alleged he was ``always
making dirty jokes, lewd comments, comments about my figure.''
   ``Suffice it to say that the Miss America organization will not
accept, nor will it tolerate,'' the types of conduct attributed to
Magness, Horn said in a statement.
   Horn and his board of directors have the power to strip the Miss
America franchise from any pageant. The Texas pageant is the
nation's biggest.
   In the Life article, Magness said he acts the part of a ``dirty
old man'' to loosen up the women and have fun, but said he has
never touched any contestant in an improper way.
   ``While I make an attempt at appearing to be a dirty old man, I
make double that attempt to make sure I'm not,'' Magness told the
magazine.
   ``Some of the girls just need to be dirtied up a little,'' he
was quoted as saying. ``It's just a continuance of their
education.''

   A woman who was required to take a
driving test because authorities thought she might be too fat to
drive safely proved Friday she can operate a car even though she
weighs 367 pounds.
   Using a borrowed, beat-up Dodge Aspen that she had only driven
once, Regina Guy passed the test with more than 75 people watching
from a distance.
   A state motor vehicle hearing examiner ordered Friday morning
that she pass the test or forfeit her license.
   ``That's it. I'm legal, guys,'' Guy said afterward.
   But she remained angry that she had to prove that her weight
doesn't stop her from being a safe driver.
   ``Fat people are human. We deserve equal treatment,'' said Guy,
25. ``Because of my size, I should not be discriminated against.''
   The Baltimore woman's problems began July 13 when she was
stopped because the lights were not working properly on another car
she had borrowed from a friend.
   The officer wrote on his report to the Motor Vehicle
Administration: ``Due to this person's obesity, she was unable to
sit behind the wheel of the car.''
   Guy was sitting in the center of the seat and was using her left
hand and left foot to drive the car, the officer said.
   ``I feel that this driver should have special equipment on her
car,'' the officer wrote.
   Guy denied she was sitting in the center of the seat or was
driving abnormally.
   ``How could I sit in the center? I couldn't possible drive from
the center,'' she said.
   Friday, Guy sat behind the wheel of the normally equipped car.
   She said she was unhappy that the officer was absent from the
hearing Friday morning. ``I still would like a chance to face my
accuser,'' she said.
   Several members of the National Association to Advance Fat
Acceptance showed up to support Guy at the hearing. Among them:
Peggy Williams, owner of the station wagon Guy was driving when she
was stopped.
   ``It's not fair. It's just not fair,'' Williams said. ``Why is
she being singled out to take a test when she did nothing to
indicate she was a bad driver?''
   Guy's lawyer, Christopher Brown, said it was a clear case of
discrimination against fat people. ``The only reason she was
singled out was because of her weight,'' he said.
   Williams said she can fit behind the wheel of her car even
though she weighs 450 pounds, almost 100 pounds more than Guy.
   ``It's not a question of her not having enough room. She has to
pull the seat closer than I do to drive,'' Williams said.

   NASA scientists rejoiced at ``pretty
damn good'' test photos from the Magellan probe today but also
grappled with communications difficulties as the spacecraft circled
Venus.
   Fifteen hours after the spacecraft lost contact with Earth on
Thursday evening, the signal was re-established. But the signal
failed again at midday and was expected to continue to be a problem
until scientists could send Magellan new instructions on how to
properly aim at Earth, officials said.
   Meanwhile, project manager Tony Spear said the test pictures
collected from the spacecraft's radar mapper before the problems
developed had produced ``some raw images that looked pretty damn
good.'' He said NASA will release the first pictures on Monday
instead of waiting until September.
   Thursday's test returned far more pictures than expected,
including several so-called ``noodles,'' or areas of the planet
about 1,000 miles long by 15 miles wide, project scientist Steve
Saunders said.
   The pictures show ``lava flows and faults and fractures and
cinder cones with craters in the top,'' Saunders said.
   Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory were concerned
when they did not hear from Magellan as expected at 8:32 p.m.
Thursday. But they stressed that the spacecraft is loaded with
computer programs that automatically help it find Earth if contact
is lost.
   Originally, scientists had expected that the outage would
continue until this evening. But late this morning, as scientists
were were conducting a news conference about the problem, Magellan
manager Steve Wall rushed in with word that NASA's Deep Space
Network station at Goldstone, Calif., had re-established contact
with the spacecraft and locked onto its signal.
   ``It is Magellan,'' Wall said. ``The spacecraft looks healthy.''
   The second loss of contact a short time afterward was not
entirely unexpected, Spear said. Scientists now expect the
spacecraft to be in and out of touch until controllers can send it
new instructions on how to properly aim at Earth, he said.
   However, the second signal loss blunted some of the sense of
relief at hearing from Magellan after the overnight silence.
   Wall said engineers had been out of contact with the spacecraft
Thursday night as it fixed on two stars, a procedure Magellan
routinely performs to make sure it is pointed properly.
   NASA should have heard from Magellan at 8:32 p.m. PDT Thursday
when this ``star calibration'' was completed, but ``we did not
re-establish contact,'' JPL spokesman Jim Doyle said.
   The last previous radio contact with the craft had been at Deep
Space Network stations at Goldstone and in Australia.
   ``The assumption is that after it made a star calibration, it
looked at the wrong star and then couldn't point back to Earth
accurately,'' Doyle said. ``Then, the contact was lost.''
   Project officials believe the spacecraft detected an unknown
onboard problem and entered a protective ``safing mode'' in which
it orients itself toward the sun so its solar array will continue
to receive power and find a guide star, said Doyle.
   From that position, it was programmed to automatically start a
routine of locating the sun, then searching for Earth, Wall said.
   The problem with Magellan comes in the wake of NASA's troubles
with the flawed Hubble Space Telescope and with hydrogen fuel leaks
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   Magellan's formal mission to map the surface of Venus is
supposed to start Aug. 29. Contact was lost after Magellan started
a two-day test meant to make sure the spaceship's radar can make
pictures of Venus and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are
focused, said lab official Ed Sherry.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, is covered by thick
clouds that prevent optical cameras from seeing its rugged
landscape.
   Magellan's $744 million mission will use radar to penetrate the
clouds, then collect the reflected waves to make the best maps and
pictures yet of Earth's nearest planetary neighbor.
   The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months
ago and went into orbit around Venus a week ago after a roundabout
948-million-mile journey.
   At least 20 U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited Venus,
including some that landed and photographed a small area of
landscape. Magellan will yield a global map.
   Its radar was designed to distinguish surface features as small
as two football fields, a level of detail 10 times better than in
pictures made by radar on two Soviet spacecraft that were launched
in 1983.

   President Bush broke his own speed
record on the Cape Arundel Golf Course Friday.
   Bush, teeing it up at 6:54 a.m., hustled around the par-69 links
course in 1:42, clipping nine minutes off his previous best.
   ``I understand he set a new aerobic golf record,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   There were only three in the presidential party: club pro Ken
Raynor Jr. and Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, part-owner of the
Texas Rangers.
   ``We could set a record today,'' Bush predicted as he set out on
the dew-soaked, deserted course. He even provided a sports
monologue for the reporters out to watch him.
   ``Silence on the first tee,'' decreed the president as he
stepped up to address the ball. ``Mr. Smooth is back. They're all

   ``... And he's not happy. Or is it up, Kenny?'' said Bush,
turning to his pro for a second opinion on the drive.
   By the time he got out of his golf cart on the 18th green, Bush

   ``I'm out of it. I did lousy,'' he confessed.
   It was his fourth golf outing since arriving in Maine Aug. 10 on
a vacation interrupted repeatedly by the gulf crisis.

   If a city councilman has his way, the town
that calls itself ``Maple City'' will prune back or uproot entirely
a 90-year-old law requiring property owners to plant trees.
   The law, passed in 1900 by the city council, assesses residents
$500 fines if they don't plant trees in front of their houses. But
Councilman Tom Stump says that's going out on a limb.
   ``It's not the city's business to demand that people plant trees
on their property,'' Stump said at a recent meeting. At the least,
the fine should be trimmed to $50, he said.
   Stump favors a separate ordinance that would recommend residents
plant certain trees, such as cottonwoods, elms and gingkos. The
council will debate the proposal Sept. 4.
   Mayor Mike Puro supports the current law, saying the trees that
line the streets of this northern Indiana city of 20,000 improve
the quality of life.

<HEAD>USDA Revises Food Price Hikes Upward for 1990, Partly Blames Oil
Crunch</HEAD>

   Consumer food prices are going up 5 percent to
7 percent this year, sharply more than had been predicted and
perhaps slightly because of the Mideast oil crunch, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The new forecast compared with the 3 percent to 5 percent price
hike the department has been predicting for 1990 since December.
   Double-digit price gains in the first half of this year for
fresh fruits, pork, eggs and dairy products, along with
``uncertainties about future energy prices,'' are mostly to blame
for the upward revision, said the department's Economic Research
Service.
   ``However, most of the year's price increases probably took
place in the first half,'' the agency said. ``Gains in the second
half are expected to be more modest.''
   But the report added that this assumes most of the evolving oil
price shock will take until next year to spill over into the
grocery store.
   Retail food prices rose an average of 5.8 percent in 1989, the
sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981. Much of that gain was
fallout from the 1988 drought that hit much of the nation.
   One USDA official who spoke only on condition of anonymity said
that without the Mideast crisis and rising energy costs, the new
food price estimate for 1990 would have been in the range of 5
percent to 6 percent.
   Thus, the official said, an allowance of only one percentage
point was made at the upper end of the estimate to allow for higher
oil prices.
   Further, the source said, some department analysts had wanted to
hold the new 1990 food price increase to less than what was
decided. Most felt the oil pinch is not going to hit this year, the
source said.
   In its official report, the agency said rising oil prices will
increase the cost of growing, processing, packaging and
distributing food.
   ``Because of the rapidly changing situation, it's unclear how
much and how fast the increases will ripple through food prices,''
the report said.
   ``While food transportation costs probably will rise in coming
months, rail costs are partly shielded from short-term movements in
fuel prices,'' the report said. ``Railroads often hold significant
inventories of diesel fuel and buy fuel under long-term contracts.''
   For river barges, lower freight rates this summer were said to
``suggest competitive pressures'' will hold down rate increases
this fall when the big crops of corn, soybeans and other
commodities head for market.
   The report, which is prepared with a team of analysts and
reviewers within the USDA agency, said the general trade embargo
will ``significantly cut'' food supplies going to Iraq. About
one-fourth its caloric food needs come from imports.
   ``Last year, about one-fourth of Iraq's agricultural imports
came from the United States,'' the report said. ``Other major
suppliers have been Australia, Canada, the EC (European Community)
and Turkey.''
   The agency said Iraq's agricultural import situation is being
monitored and that ``implications for trade are being reevaluated''
on a continuous basis.

<HEAD>Governor Announces Cuts in Local Aid, Retirement Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said Friday he plans
to cut $333 million in local aid to help balance the state budget,
and those reductions also will hurt school budgets.
   ``Although we tried to address the revenue shortfall without
affecting aid to public education, it was not possible to do so,''
Wilder said.
   ``If our revenue situation improves, I will seek to mitigate
these funding reductions as the first order of business,'' he told
a meeting of the Senate Finance, House Finance and House
Appropriations committees.
   Wilder's budget director, Karen Washabau, said other cuts the
governor has proposed in state agency spending could cause 400 to
1,500 layoffs. But she said those figures were tentative until the
governor decides Sept. 14 what specific cuts he will order.
   Wilder elaborated on cuts he announced during a statewide
televised address Thursday night to deal with a projected $1.4
billion shortfall in the state's $26 billion, 1990-92 budget, which
is biennial. He said tax collections are expected to drop because
of a slowing state economy.
   Wilder said he will also order $375 million in state agency
cuts, withdraw a 2 percent state employee raise set for December
and use more than $300 million in lottery profits for operating
expenses instead of building projects.
   He also proposed cutting $11 million in state money for private
museums and attractions and eliminating several minor agencies that
are budgeted for about $5 million.
   Several legislators complained they were left out of the
budget-cutting plans and still had little idea how Wilder's
proposed cuts will affect services in their districts.
   Legislators and education officials also said they were worried
that cuts in school aid could force localities to raise taxes.
   State Sen. Stanley C. Walker, a former Norfolk School Board
member, said local school budgets are already tight.
   ``The least setback can be meaningful and knock you down,'' he
said.
   Local governments ``are going to feel the pinch,'' said Madeline
Wade, president of the Virginia Education Association, a teachers'
organization. ``They're going to have to make some tough
decisions.''

   The Navy partially lifted the veil of secrecy
Friday from the A-12 Avenger stealth airplane being developed as
its main bomber for the early 21st century.
   The Navy released an artist's drawing of the plane, which
resembles a manta ray. The two air intakes on the front underside
of the aircraft look a bit like gills.
   No details were provided on the exact dimensions and other
features of the previously secret aircraft.
   The Avenger is the latest in a family of new-generation aircraft
with stealth radar-evading technology. The Air Force is building
B-2 stealth long-range bombers and F-117A stealth fighter-bombers
using composite materials that limit radar reflections.
   The Avenger is still under development and has been the subject
of growing controversy since the Navy announced earlier this year
that it was a year behind schedule.
   Both the Defense Department and the Navy are investigating the
delays, which came to light after the department had completed a
months-long review of its main aircraft programs. The problems
reportedly involve the manufacture of stealth composite materials.
   Last April Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced he was
cutting the Avenger purchase from 858 to 620 planes.
   The Navy has not released figures on the Avenger's full
production cost but it has been reported that it could reach $55
billion. The plane currently is in the full-scale development phase
under a $4.78 billion Navy contract held jointly by McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.
   The Bush administration requested $1.1 billion in production
funds for the Avenger for the 1991 budget year starting Oct. 1, but
both the House and Senate have eliminated all production funds for
the coming year, leaving only a smaller amount for research and
development.
   The Avenger is designed to replace the A-6E Intruder, which has
been the Navy's main attack aircraft for 27 years.
   The Avenger is designed to penetrate sophisticated missiles
defenses to deliver bombs with exceptional accuracy against fixed
and mobile targets on land and sea. Its automated electronic
cockpit includes a missile warning system for early identification
of enemy radars and guided missiles.
   The plane is named after the World War II Avenger that was the
first attack aircraft with radar.

   Iraq's effort to settle its war with
neighboring Iran appears aimed at securing the use of an Iranian
pipeline to ``punch a hole'' in the U.S.-enforced U.N. embargo on
its oil exports, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee
said Friday.
   ``There's something very strange about this deal ...,'' said
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis. ``It is essentially a total capitulation by
Iraq. There's a possibility we're going to see Iran exporting Iraqi
oil.''
   A United Nations Security Council resolution prohibiting trade
with Iraq over its conquest of Kuwait has stopped the flow of
nearly 4.5 million barrels of oil daily from the two countries,
sending world oil prices up by more than $7 a barrel.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered Wednesday to withdraw all
troops from Iranian territory and give up control of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway along the countries' border. Aspin said he
is ``skeptical that the real reason'' Saddam made the offer was to
free Iraqi troops to face a U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia.
   ``That deal has to go down very hard with his military,'' Aspin
said of Saddam. ``They just spent eight years fighting a war there.
We're looking at some other deal here. I'm concerned he's going to
try to use it to punch a hole in the sanctions and embargo.''
   One of Iraq's major pipelines runs along the Shatt-al-Arab. And
at one point, it is just five miles and across the waterway from
Iranian pipelines leading into and out of its refinery at Abadan.
   Although the Abadan refinery was blown up in the Iran-Iraq war,
Iran still moves much of its 3 million barrels of oil a day through
the pipeline to its main export terminal at Kharg Island.
   ``It would only take a matter of weeks'' to bridge the two
pipelines, Aspin said. He estimated that Iraq could then move as
much as 1 million barrels a day, or roughly more than one-third of
its pre-embargo oil exports through the pipeline to Kharg Island.
   ``The secret of the potential success of the embargo and the
sanctions is the oil,'' Aspin said. ``There might still be food and
other things coming in from Jordan or Iran, but it's going to be
limited unless you have the money to pay for them.''

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Aug.1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7 million head, up
4 percent from a year ago but down 2 percent from two years ago,
the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Feedlot inventories were up from a year earlier in Arizona, Iowa
and Texas. But they declined in California, Colorado and Kansas.
They held steady in Nebraska.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in July totaled 1.75 million head,
up 3 percent from a year ago but 2 percent fewer than two years ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.52 million head, up 18 percent from a year
ago and 22 percent more than in July 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Aug.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   The parliament of Soviet Georgia on Friday debated
details of multiparty elections set for October, the first such
balloting in the republic's history, Tass reported.
   Last month, radicals blocked a key railway junction for about a
week to protest what they saw as official attempts to block the
republic's elections. The blockade disrupted passenger and freight
service and cost the republic an estimated $6.4 million, the
official Tass news agency said.
   The parliament, which convened Friday in Georgia's capital of
Tbilisi, intends to adopt one of three election bills, according to
the Interfax independent news service.
   One bill was drafted by the Communist Party and one by the
opposition. A third combines elements of both proposals.
   The opposition draft calls for a system of proportional
representation, a five-year residency requirement for voters, and a
10-year residency requirement for candidates, Interfax said.
   It also reportedly calls for barring parties in the Soviet
system from participating in the elections, which are set for Oct.
28.
   Interfax said speakers at a demonstration in Tbilisi on Thursday
threatened civil disobedience unless the parliament passes the more
radical measure.
   On March 9, the Caucasus republic of Georgia joined other
republics bent on breaking with the Kremlin when its parliament
condemned what it called forcible Soviet annexation in the 1920s.
It demanded negotiations on restoring independence.
   Several small pro-independence parties in Georgia have been
pressing hard for secession for more than a year.

   Texans and Iowans, already up to their hip pockets in rain,
braced for more heavy downpours and flash floods Friday.
   Showers and thunderstorms moved northward from Mexico into
southwest Texas Friday afternoon. Heavy rain has saturated the
ground in the area, and any additional rain could result in flash
flooding.
   A flood warning remained in effect for the Rio Grande River from
Presidio, Texas through Big Bend National Park to the mouth of the
Pecos River near Langtry, Texas. The Rio Grande River was out of
its banks near Presidio and Lajitas, and was still rising at
several other locations.
   Thunderstorms deluged parts of Iowa and Illinois Thursday night
and Friday morning. Rainfall totals included 4} inches at Lowden,
Iowa; 3{ inches at East Moline, Ill, and more than 3 inches at
Tipton, Bettendorf, and Dubuque, Iowa.
   Strong thunderstorms erupted across southeast Idaho Friday
afternoon. A tornado touched down southwest of Pocatello, Idaho,
and funnel clouds were observed in Power County, Idaho.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also scattered from south Texas
across the Gulf Coast, over Florida and eastern North Carolina, and
from the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi Valley southeast
to the lower Ohio Valley.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms extended from the north
Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies, and over the central High
Plains.
   Hot and humid weather was the rule from the Southeast across the
middle and lower Mississippi Valley to much of the Plains. Readings
had climbed into the 90s from Georgia and Florida across the lower
Mississippi Valley to eastern sections of Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas.
   Temperatures also were in the 90s over South Dakota and
northeastern Nebraska, in southeast California, southern Nevada and
southern Arizona.
   Temperatures were in the 60s over Oregon, northeast Montana and
along the Northern California coast.
   The low for the Lower 48 Friday morning was 35 degrees at
Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Redmond, Ore., to 102 at Meridian, Miss.

<HEAD>Police Move to Prevent Serb-Croatian Flareups in Yugoslavia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police and police reserves took up
position Friday in Knin to prevent flareups between Croats and
Serbs agitating for automony within Croatia, the state Tanjug news
agency reported.
   Earlier, army jets intercepted three helicopters of the Croatian
Interior Ministry and forced them to return to base, Tanjug
reported. The ministry is in charge of police.
   The army is dominated by Serbs, traditional rivals of Croatians.
But Gen. Bozidar Adzic, chief of state of the federal armed forces,
played down the encounter, telling Croatian TV the jets scrambled
only because the helicopters strayed from proper flight corridors.
   Traditional rivalry between the two ethnic groups was aggravated
by the Croatian government's decision to bar a referendum of Serbs
in the republic on Serbian autonomy within Croatia.
   The Serb minority of 400,000 in western Croatia had been
scheduled to start two weeks of voting Sunday on the issue.
   Serbia and Croatia have been rivals since they were united
within Yugoslavia in 1918 as two of the nation's six republics.
   In Knin, a town of about 10,000 with a large Serb population,
police with rifles stood guard around strategic buildings, said
witnesses contacted by telephone.
   ``In Obrovac and Benkovac, large crowds of citizens are in the
streets, hindering and stopping traffic,'' Tanjug said Friday,
citing a statement by the Croatian Interior Ministry.
   Tanjug said hundreds of Serbs broke into a police station in the
town of Grachc.
   Authorities in Croatia had anticipated trouble. On Thursday,
they ordered the disarming of the army reserve in Benkovac, which
is dominated by Serbs.
   Croatian authorities attacked the plebiscite, saying it was
aimed at undermining democratic reforms in Croatia.
   Croatia's interior minister, Iosip Bojkovac, said, ``The
situation is very tense and has been artificially inflamed'' by the
Communist government and news media in neighboring Serbia, the
nation's largest republic.
   The Serbs in Croatia are strongly supported by the state-run
media in Serbia, where the Communist party has balked at holding
Western-style elections and has described the government in Croatia
as ``fascist and racist.''
   The center-right Croatian Democratic Union political party this
year overwhelmingly won the first free elections in Croatia in more
than 50 years.
   Tanjug contradicted earlier reports Friday that federal army
units moved into Knin, in a poor farming region, after Mayor Milan
Babic declared a ``state of war.'' It said no soldiers were in the
streets.
   Serbs say hundreds of thousands of their compatriots were
murdered in Croatia during World War II by a Nazi-type unit of
Croatian nationalists.
   Serbs in Croatia claim they are being systematically
discriminated against by those they describe as extremists in the
CDU.
   Croatia's new government advocates turning the Yugoslav
federation into a loose association of semi-independent states in
which national minorities would be guaranteed full political and
national rights.
   ``If Croatia is going to opt for confederal status within
Yugoslavia, the Serb minority will demand full political
self-government,'' Jovan Raskovic, head of the Serbian minority,
said in an interview.
   About 5,000 Serbs gathered in Nova Pazova, a Serbian town north
of Belgrade, late Friday in noisy support of their brethren in
Croatia. About 1,000 Serbs attended a similar rally in Belgrade
hours later.
   No incidents were reported.

   U.S. Navy ships on Friday intercepted two
Iraqi vessels in the Persian Gulf but allowed them to proceed after
determining they carried no goods, the Pentagon said.
   The USS England, a guided-missile cruiser, and the frigate USS
Bradley intercepted the Iraqi vessels off the coast of Bahrain at
8:17 p.m. local time (1:17 p.m. EDT), the Pentagon said.
   The ships were not boarded.
   President Bush on Thursday ordered U.S. naval forces in the gulf
area to begin intercepting all commercial shipping to and from Iraq
and Kuwait to enforce the United Nations' economic sanctions
against Iraq. The sanctions are aimed at throttling Iraq's economy
to force a withdrawal of the Iraqi army from Kuwait.
   Bush's orders allow the Navy to board and search cargo ships and
tankers and, if necessary, take them into custody to prevent them
from reaching their destinations. The orders also allow ship
commanders to use force to stop vessels that resist.

   A truck hauling 9,000 gallons of gasoline
overturned and exploded Friday, killing the driver and igniting a
fire so intense firefighters were blistered through their
protective clothing, authorities said.
   ``It looked just like a small nuclear explosion,'' said Tony
Eastman, a teacher visiting his parents a few miles from the
accident on Maine Route 25. The accident occurred in an unpopulated
area near this southwestern Maine town.
   The driver, identified as Kyle Letterman, of Manchester, N.H.,
was going down a hill and around a curve Friday morning when the
truck's load shifted and he lost control, said state police Lt.
Brad Cochran.
   The explosion caused a fire that ignited some trees across the
road and took firefighters about an hour to control, police said.
   Two firefighters were treated for blisters caused by the heat,
which reached 500 degrees, said Leonard Drowns, fire chief in
neighboring Kezar Falls. No other injuries were reported.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, saying the Cold
War is over, pledged major military changes next year that could
include switching to an all-volunteer force and eliminating some
armed services.
   The Soviet leader spoke at the Black Sea port of Odessa, where
he reviewed Soviet troops involved in mock combat. The nightly
television news program ``Vremya'' showed him in shirt sleeves
shaking hands with soldiers taking part in the exercise.
   ``Our armed services were established to handle tasks of the
Cold War,'' Gorbachev said. ``This war is now over.''
   Gorbachev, quoted by the Soviet news agency Tass, said a panel
next month will begin drawing up recommendations on military reform
and will submit them to parliament. The changes will decide the
strength and quality of the armed services in the 1990s.
   He said planners will determine whether it is necessary to
maintain all five branches of the Soviet armed services _ the army,
navy, air force, air defenses and strategic rocket forces _ and
what role each should play.
   Gorbachev said officials must decide whether the Soviet Union
can abandon conscription and create an all-volunteer force. He
indicated that officials should decide whether to give Soviet
republics a greater say in how and where troops should serve.
   Soviet army officers interviewed on a recent press tour of four
army bases said they expected a gradual switch to a volunteer army
and welcomed it.

<HEAD>Canadian Police Refuse to Clear Indian Rail Blockade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE RIVER, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian government ordered the
removal of Indian protest barricades blocking the country's main
east-west rail link, but provincial authorities on Friday balked at
intervening.
   The Long Lake Indians say they are trying to attract the federal
government's attention to a land ownership dispute dating to 1915,
when the railway was put through an Indian reserve.
   On Thursday, the federal government told Canadian National Rail
to remove protest blockades erected Monday in northern Ontario.
   But provincial police Constable Bob Gilman said Friday, ``No
enforcement action will be taken as long as a negotiated settlement
is possible.
   ``We're monitoring things, but that's all we intend to do for
now.''
   Gilman spoke in Long Lake, about 185 miles northeast of Thunder
Bay on Lake Superior.
   The Long Lake band is blocking the main line of government-owned
CN Rail.
   CN spokesman Roger Cameron said officials asked for police help
because the railway believes it has a legal right to clear the
blockade.
   ``It's affecting operations and our ability to serve our
customers,'' he said from Montreal. ``We have the legal right to
operate where we do.''
   About 120 miles south of the Long Lake barricades, band members
used steel rails and railway ties Thursday to block a CP Rail line
through the Pic Mobert Indian reserve.
   That barrier will stay put, said band Chief James Kwissiwa,
until federal Indian Affairs Minister Tom Siddon or Health and
Welfare Minister Perrin Beatty visit the reserve to discuss an
unsettled land claim and improvements in housing conditions, roads,
sewers and water service.
   Siddon told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. on Thursday he won't
meet band leaders until the blockades come down.
   ``We will not deal in the face of roadblocks and intimidation.
That's not the way that we do business,'' he said in Vancouver,
British Columbia.
   Federal officials have also been trying to settle a 5-week-old
armed standoff between Quebec provincial police and Mohawk Indians
at Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal. The Mohawks are trying to block
a golf course extension on land they claim as ancestral.

   Saudi Arabian Prince Turki Bin Abdul
Aziz, a brother of King Fahd, said Friday a boycott against Iraq
will not work and that swift action is necessary to drive Saddam
Hussein out of Kuwait.
   ``I believe that this embargo, this boycott, is not going to be
useful because you know there are many merchants of war who make
their living by contributing to the escalation of war among
nations,'' Turki said through an interpreter.
   The prince said the best course would be for an international
force to take swift military action to end Hussein's rule.
   ``I think if they want to put a quick end to it, the United
States knows how to do that,'' Prince Turki said. ``I am not
talking about eliminating him physically or assassination, but they
should put an end to his rule _ to his regime because he is a
bloodthirsty person and that's his trade, he lives off blood.''
   The prince, 53, made his remarks at a news conference in a
lavishly decorated hotel ballroom near Harvard Square, where he and
his entourage have been staying for the past two weeks. Turki said
he came to Cambridge to talk with Harvard University about ways he
could help enhance the school's educational programs in medicine
and human rights.
   The prince, one of the king's seven full brothers, said he did
not have a clear idea how many Arab troops have joined American
forces in the region.
   But his political adviser, Mustafa Aziz, had said in an
interview before the prince arrived at the conference that he
understood about 5,000 Arab troops were there, mostly Egyptians but
also Syrians and Moroccans.
   In an exchange that required several attempts at clarification,
the prince said that if Saddam Hussein had been at all concerned
about vengeance he should have moved on the West Bank nine years
ago when Israel bombed an Iraqi nuclear plant.
   His translator, Zaki Aslan, said the prince was not calling for
an assault on Israel, just pointing out a lack of logic in Saddam
Hussein's rationale for moving on Kuwait because the two countries
were once part of the same empire.
   Prince Turki said Saddam Hussein ``is a sadist and a psychotic.
He enjoys killing people.'' He called him a liar for several
reasons, including his overture to Iran after the deaths of
thousands of Iranians in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   The prince, former deputy minister of defense, also said he was
disappointed in King Hussein of Jordan, who met with President Bush
Thursday.
   ``I was hoping that King Hussein would not go down and lower
himself to come to the United States as an emissary of Saddam
Hussein,'' he said. `` I thought he would honor himself further if
he hadn't done so.''
   King Hussein originally was believed to be carrying a message
from Saddam Hussein, but he said after his meeting with Bush that
he had brought no such message.
   The prince was joined at the news conference Friday by his wife,
Princess Hend, a son, and a daughter. They sat with dozens of
reporters at a breakfast press conference, held in a ballroom
decorated with elaborate flower arrangements.
   The princess, who speaks English and who studied in the United
States for a year, broke in pointedly two times during the news
conference to demand what she thought were necessary clarifications
of the translation.
   Princess Hend also talked briefly with reporters. Although she
declined to discuss political questions, the princess said several
times that the people in her country were shocked by the invasion
of Kuwait.
   ``Friends are worried,'' she said. ``They're in shock. They are
in a state of standby.''

<HEAD>Study Shows Kids Can Cause Parents to Drink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disruptive children can cause parents
to drink more, a Florida State University study released Friday
shows.
   ``I'm not suggesting we blame children for the alcoholism of
their parents, because those who grow up in alcoholic homes have
suffered enough already,'' said Dr. Alan Lang, an associate
professor of psychology at Florida State. ``Nonetheless,
particularly difficult children can cause distress for parents and,
in some cases, this may contribute to increased alcohol use.''
   Contrary to the teachings of self-help groups, who place the
onus on parents and tell children of alcoholics they aren't to
blame, the Florida State study may provide the first documented
evidence that children actually can cause their parents to drink
more.
   Lang teamed with Dr. William Pelham of the University of
Pittsburgh to conduct the research.
   ``Our studies show how the destructive role of alcohol in
parent-child interactions is a two-way street,'' Lang said.
``Problem drinkers make poor parents, but problem children may also
drive parents to drink.''
   He said the findings are similar to those of studies that show
children who are mentally retarded or have serious behavioral
problems are abused more often than normal, obedient children.
   ``The point is that while we usually think of parents as
influencers of children, children can affect parents as well,''
Lang said. ``And the outcome is not always favorable.''
   Dr. Robin Room, scientific director of the Alchohol Research
Group of the Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, wasn't
surprised by the findings but said it was important to look into
the cause of drinking among parents, ``rather than give in to the
bumper sticker-type humor that says children cause their parents to
drink.
   ``It's important to understand that parental drinking patterns
can later influence their children's drinking patterns,'' Room said.
   The Florida researchers, under a grant from the National
Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, asked 120 parents with
5-to-12-year-old sons to interact with an unfamiliar boy of a
similar age.
   The parents were then given an opportunity to drink as much or
as little alcohol as they wanted, while anticipating a second
interaction with the same child.
   Half of the parents in the study had difficult children of their
own with short attention spans, hyperactivity, conduct disorders,
or some combination of the three. The other half had only children
without behavior disorders.
   But the researchers stacked the deck. Half the parents had
initially interacted with boys who behaved normally, while half had
faced boys trained by the researchers to behave in an overactive
and disruptive way.
   Among parents of normal children, those who interacted with
disruptive boys drank one-third more than those who interacted with
a cooperative child.
   ``I feel justified in suggesting that these results indicate
that drinking is a parental behavior that can be influenced by the
characteristics and behaviors of children,'' Lang said.
   Parents with disruptive children at home responded differently
to the study, however, depending on the drinking patterns of their
own parents. Those who had a family history of drinking problems
drank 50 percent more after interacting with a deviant child-actor,
while those with no such family history drank less.
   ``This suggests that people differ in their vulnerability to
increased drinking in response to the stress of interactions with a
difficult child,'' Lang said.

   Japanese Ambassador Chusaku Nomura
and his flight instructor were killed Friday morning when their
plane collided with a second aircraft and crashed into a house,
aviation officials said.
   A Japanese Embassy official confirmed the death of Nomura, 56.
Also killed was instructor Albert Jensen. The other plane, carrying
one man, sustained minor damage but landed without incident.
   Authorities said they do not know who was piloting the plane
Nomura was in.
   A household employee said Nomura had been taking flying lessons
for about three months.
   ``On one occasion, I believe it was last week, the ambassador
told me he now could fly solo,'' said the housekeeper, who
identified herself only as Maria.
   Television reports quoted a civil aviation official as saying
the planes had been ordered to change course but that one of them
did not do so.
   Alvaro Escalante, director of Costa Rica's Civil Aviation, said
the crash occurred at 7:55 a.m. shortly after the plane took off
from Tobias Bolanos Airport, west of the capital.
   Parts of the ambassador's plane fell on an empty house about a
mile from the airport, Escalante said.
   Nomura, who arrived in this Central American nation last
December, had 30 years' diplomatic service.

   Cuban officials refused Spain's request to
import cots for 18 Cuban asylum-seekers who have been holed up
since late July at Madrid's embassy in Havana, Cuba's official news
agency Prensa Latina said Friday.
   It marked the latest escalation in the dispute over Cubans who
have invaded embassies in Havana in recent months, seking asylum.
The wrangle has soured relations between Communist Cuba and Spain,
traditional allies.
   In its report, monitored in Mexico City, Prensa Latina said a
Foreign Ministry spokesman expressed Cuban suspicions that Spanish
officials lack ``a real will . . . to search for a solution to the
problem.''
   The report quoted unidentified high-level sources at the
ministry as saying Cuba refused to allow cots and mattresses to be
brought in for the refugees. Cuba has refused to let the refugees
leave the country. Spain has allowed them to stay in the embassy,
which Cuban officials cannot legally violate.
   Similar incidents at the Czechoslovak, Swiss and Italian
missions ended when the asylum-seekers returned home after Cuba
promised not to prosecute them. However, nine more asylum-seekers
entered the Belgian ambassador's residence this week.

   Swift criticism Friday did not keep
Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos from repeating his assertion that
students who don't speak English are not ready for public education.
   ``Parental involvement and language competency are basic,''
Cavazos told about 1,500 teachers and principals in this city on
the Mexican border. ``If that child cannot speak English the first
day of school, that child is not ready to learn.''
   In a panel discussion later, South Texas superintendents
criticized Cavazos, saying students were capable of learning in
other languages.
   ``The comment that we heard this morning that students who are
not speaking English are not ready to learn is a disabling
comment,'' said Robert Zamora, superintendent of the La Joya school
district.
   Later Friday, during a news conference across the border in
Nuevo Laredo, Cavazos repeated the comment and added: ``We work
with the parents, with the schools to prepare the youngsters in
English so they will learn ... My final point that I always make is
that they not forget that other language and that culture.''
   Cavazos, former president of Texas Tech University, said he
supports bilingual education, but that its goal should be
encouraging students to speak English so they do not miss
opportunities in the United States.
   It was not the first time Cavazos drew criticism from fellow
Hispanics for his comments on Hispanic education. In April, the
League of United Latin American Citizens criticized him for blaming
Hispanic parents for the high dropout rate among their children.
   In March, he angered some Hispanic lawmakers when he told the
state Legislature that money was not the answer to education
problems.
   Cavazos repeated that stance Friday, saying that education could
be improved by giving teachers more freedom and allowing local
schools more control.
   ``The new bottom line in education is not how much do we need to
spend by how much are our students learning,'' Cavazos said.
   He stressed that he was referring to public schools across the
nation, not just in Texas, and acknowledged ``there have been some
inequities'' in school finance in the state.
   In Nuevo Laredo, Cavazos and Mexican Education Secretary Manuel
Bartlett Diaz signed an agreement calling for closer educational
ties between the two countries. The agreement paves the way for a
``border conference'' on education next winter.

   Ambassadors of the five permanent members
of the Security Council held an unprecedented joint meeting with
senior military aides Friday to discuss an expanded U.N. military
role in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The purpose of this gathering was to exchange information on
the naval activities in the gulf and in the area,'' French
Ambassador Pierre Louis Blanc told reporters after the meeting at
the French mission.
   The session was attended by U.N. envoys of the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union and by military
advisers of the five governments, together known as the Security
Council's Military Staff Committee.
   The committee was created 44 years ago when the United Nations
was new, but has been inactive, meeting on a perfunctory basis two
times a month.
   Diplomats emphasized that Friday was no ordinary meeting. It
included senior U.S., British and French officers. A senior Soviet
official was unable to attend and the level of the Chinese military
was not known.
   Blanc said consultations were informal and further meetings
could follow if the need arises.
   No immediate indication surfaced that the five were moving to
form a joint U.N. military command in the gulf or to fly the U.N.
flag. But Western observers said the five had moved with
extraordinary speed to discuss coordination for the first time and
reactivate a U.N. military role.
   ``We won't have a U.N. army tomorrow,`` one said, ``but we could
have exchange of information and coordination, letting each other
know about rules of engagement. And that is quite significant.
   ``By U.N. standards, that is whirlwind progress.''
   The observers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Under the U.N. Charter, the Military Staff Committee is charged
with coordinating all U.N. military actions of an enforcement
nature, excluding peacekeeping.
   It is intended to organize and command joint military
operations, which never have come into existence. The last time the
U.N. flag was flown in a U.N. enforcement operation was during the
1950-53 Korean War.
   That war was not strictly a U.N. operation, however, and was
handed over to the United States.
   Moscow has been pressing for an expanded U.N. peacekeeping role
and for revival of the U.N. Military Staff Committee. Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Friday the Soviet Union would
send troops to the gulf if the United Nations calls for a
multilateral military force.
   The Soviet Union has said it would not participate except under
a U.N. flag.
   The United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union are
especially interested in some kind of coordination, but China is
wary, diplomats said.
   They said Beijing wants to see what action the Arab states take
in the crisis before committing itself to outside military action.
   The five permanent members began meeting on the military
question on Tuesday in Washington and met again Thursday in New
York.

   A top Iraqi official said Friday that
Baghdad will keep all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' until
the threat of war against Iraq is lifted.
   About 3,000 U.S. citizens are being held in Iraq, most of them
taken from occupied Kuwait following the Aug. 2 invasion by Iraqi
forces, as well as at least 4,000 British citizens.
   The statement, carried by the official Iraqi news agency, was
monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in Nicosia.
   ``The people of Iraq have decided to play host to the citizens
of these aggressive nations as long as Iraq remains threatened with
an aggressive war,'' said Iraqi's parliament speaker Sadi Mahdi.
   Iraq's invasion prompted an international embargo on goods in
and out of Iraq. Tens of thousands of U.S. and foreign forces have
massed in the area, mostly in Saudi Arabia, to oppose further Iraqi
military action.
   ``This measure will remain in force until such time as tangible
and sufficient guarantees are forthcoming fro the people of Iraq
that the danger of oppressive aggression has passed,'' Madhi said.
   He singled out the U.S. government among all Western governments
for what he called ``going out of their way to take hostile and
unjust stands toward Iraq.''
   He said these governments had lied repeatedly about the issue,
which he referred to as ``precautionary measures taken to keep the
nationals of these countries in Iraq.''
   Baghdad holds an estimated 14,000 Westerners, apart from 2,500
Americans and 4,000 Britons trapped in Kuwait during the invasion.
About 500 other Americans were in Iraq at the time of the invasion.
   The decision announced by the parliament speaker came after a
meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council chaired by President
Saddam Hussein. This week, the government had said foreigners in
Iraq and occupied Kuwait were considered ``restrictees.''
   Saddam on Thursday called President Bush a ``liar'' for sending
troops to the region and acting in a warlike manner.
   INA carried a separate, brief dispatch saying only that the
Council met to discuss Iraq's peace moves toward Iran, which
included the start of releasing prisoners of war during the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq conflict and troop withdrawels from the border Friday.
   The Council controls the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party,
which handpicks most of the members of Iraq's parliament.

   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
has asked the National Assembly to pardon five men accused of
assassinating her husband, the opposition Sandinista party
newspaper Barricada said Friday.
   The victim, Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, was a prominent and highly
respected newspaper publisher whose death in January 1978 helped
ignite the revolution that overthrew the right-wing dictatorship of
Anastasio Somoza in 1979.
   Sandinistas, now Mrs. Chamorro's political foes, have praised
her husband as a ``martyr for public freedoms.''
   Barricada said the president sent a letter to the speaker of the
national legislature asking the pardon, but officials contacted by
The Associated Press neither confirmed nor denied the report.
   Mrs. Chamorro said in June she would seek such a pardon.
   Barricada said a government source gave it a copy of her letter
and quoted it as saying, ``As the offended party, I have
demonstrated to the National Assembly my feelings to forgive and
forget toward those who were the material authors of the
assassination and other related crimes.
   ``Therefore, I ask the pardon within the spirit of
reconciliation which motivates me.''
   No one answered repeated telephone calls to the presidency.
   After Chamorro's assassination, the Somoza-era police arrested
men described as hired gunmen: Silvio Pena, Domingo Acevedo, Silvio
Vega, Harold Cedeno and Juan Ramon Acevedo. All remain in prison,
but were never formally convicted.
   According to Barricada, Mrs. Chamorro asked that they be
pardoned along with 82 other common criminals.
   After the Sandinistas took power in 1979, the Chamorro family
brought a court case accusing Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, a son
of the dictator, along with Somoza official Fausto Zelaya and Cuban
exile Pedro Ramos of being authors of the plot to kill Chamorro.
   The newspaper said Mrs. Chamorro's petition did not say whether
those men should be included in the pardon. All fled into exile
after Somoza fell.
   Her husband, publisher of La Prensa and long a vocal critic of
the Somoza dictatorship, was ambushed and shot on a Managua street.
   For decades, La Prensa was Nicaragua's only opposition
newspaper. His death touched off violent demonstrations and rallied
the Nicaraguan opposition to back the Sandinista revolution.
   The leftist Sandinistas governed the country until April 25,
when Mrs. Chamorro took office after winning February elections in
a landslide.

   A Marine opposed to ``interventionist'' U.S.
foreign policy sought conscientious objector status Friday and was
transferred to a unit that won't be deployed to the Persian Gulf
for operation Desert Shield, his lawyer said.
   Cpl. Jeffrey Paterson, stationed at Kaneohe Marine Corps Air
Station on the island of Oahu, said he would not fight to protect
oil prices and opposed ``interventionist'' policies in the Mideast.
   Paterson, 22, of Hollister, Calif., is reportedly the second
Kaneohe Marine to seek conscientious objector status.
   Eric A. Seitz, Paterson's attorney, said the soldier's
application was accepted for processing Friday, but that a decision
could take ``some time.''
   Paterson, who had worked as a supply clerk and in field
artillery, was transferred to a non-deployable unit, Seitz said.
   However, Capt. Leonard Ryan, public affairs officer at the base,
would not confirm that Paterson had changed units. Ryan said
Paterson had been charged with unauthorized leave for being away
from his unit Thursday, but no other charges were planned.
   A Marine Corps spokeswoman in Washington said officials there
were unaware of the case and would not comment.
   Paterson said he had been tentatively scheduled to leave for the
Middle East on Sunday. Base spokesmen would not discuss planned
deployments.
   ``I can't fight for the military at all anymore,'' he said. ``If
I was going to El Salvador, I'd do the same thing.''
   Paterson, who has seven months left in the Marines, said he
belongs to ``La Casa,'' a group that objects to U.S.
``interventionist'' policies.
   There are ``very few people who want to go to Saudi Arabia and
fight for the price of oil,'' he said. ``All wars are in the
objectives of leaders and corporations and not the people.''
   Paterson said he joined the Marines in 1986 but two years later
joined organizations opposed to U.S. policy in Central and South
America and the Middle East.
   He said he hoped the media attention about his case would make
the Marines ``want to get rid of me as soon as possible.''
   Seitz said the soldier told him Marine officials were
considering charging him with a number of violations under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice.
   Among the possible charges were unauthorized leave, releasing
classified information and inciting others to resist orders, Seitz
said. But Ryan said no further charges were planned because
Paterson returned to his unit Friday.
   Christopher Marler, another Marine stationed at the base, filed
a lawsuit Aug. 10 seeking a court order to prevent his deployment
to the Middle East. Marler had filed for conscientious objector
status in April, citing his Protestant religious beliefs.
   The government said it agreed not to send Marler into combat
because his application was filed months ago. Marler was
unavailable for comment Friday.

   The country's wetlands are so diverse that
a national policy to save them should be managed by the states, a
federal task force was told Friday.
   The Domestic Policy Council's Wetlands Task Force held the first
of six public hearings around the country to discuss how to meet
President Bush's ``no net loss'' goal. Meetings will also be held
in Illinois, Louisiana, Washington state, Alaska and Rhode Island.
   ``I think there are many areas where this country has to have a
uniform policy, but not in this kind of area where you have so much
diversity and so much local color and so many local
ramifications,'' said North Dakota Gov. George Sinner.
   Environmentalists say development _ mainly agriculture _ has
claimed about 55 percent of the nation's wetlands. In addition to
providing a home for wildlife, the country's remaining 99 million
acres of wetlands help control erosion and recharge groundwater.
   Last year, Bush pledged to create a federal policy requiring
that any wetlands developed equal the number of acres reclaimed.
   In 1987, North Dakota passed the country's first no-net-loss
wetlands law, which established a land bank to replace swamps and
marshes acre-for-acre.
   David Sprynczynatyk, engineer for the state Water Commission,
said North Dakota has added 632 acres of wetlands since the law
took effect. It has about 2 million acres of wetlands, the most in
the contiguous United States.
   ``I just can't see how the policy can work with a myriad of
federal agencies coming in with new regulations, sometimes
overlapping, sometimes conflicting,'' said Sinner.
   Officials from other Western states agreed.
   ``State boundaries are too artificial. They don't respect the
boundaries of wetlands or drainage basins,'' said Robert Hall, of
the Denver Water Department. ``Give the state or states the
flexibility to do that to meet an overall goal. But let us do the
balancing.''
   Western farmers said they should be able to help decide which
land should be protected.
   ``The bitter hostility caused by the total disregard of the
landowners' wishes and constitutional rights has resulted in a
wetlands war in which wildlife has been caught in the crossfire,
and nobody wins,'' said Wes Tossett, co-chairman of the North
Dakota Agriculture Coalition.
   Environmentalists at the meeting said a national policy _ even
if managed by the states _ should take effect right away. Wayne
Baron of the National Wildlife Federation estimated 600,000 acres
of wetlands have been lost nationwide since President Bush
announced the no net loss goal.
   ``Quite frankly, we're waiting for the action,'' he said.

   Cool weather washed over much of fire-scarred areas of
California on Friday and officials partially reopened Yosemite
National Park, which had been closed to tourists for more than a
week.
   Yosemite spokeswoman Pat Tolle said Highway 120 reopened Friday
into the high country over Tioga Pass, about 180 miles east of San
Francisco, for the first time since Aug. 9. But the road leading
into Yosemite Valley remained closed because of slides and burning
snags.
   The valley, the park's most popular destination and site of Half
Dome, El Capitan and other marvels, was not scheduled to be
available to visitors until Monday, Tolle said.
   National Park Service spokeswoman Claudine Gale said
firefighters had nearly contained the 18,100-acre ``A''-Rock fire,
of which 6,490 acres were in Yosemite and 11,610 acres in
Stanislaus National Forest.
   The other major Yosemite fire, the 5,280-acre Steamboat blaze,
was contained Thursday.
   In all, the California fires have burned about 270,000 acres, or
more than 400 square miles, and destroyed 127 structures. The cost
of fighting the fires has grown to about $45 million.
   By Friday, most of the army of 15,500 firefighters amassed
against the onslaught had been sent home.
   Thunderstorms _ which ignited nearly all the 1,300 fires across
the state by spawning 37,532 lightning strikes in two weeks _ are
likely to recur when the cooling trend ends Monday, said Milo
Radulovich, a National Weather Service fire expert.
   ``Once this pattern is over, we're going to go back to where we
were. It'll be hot and dry, especially in September. It will be
critical fire weather,'' Radulovich said.
   Many of California's worst wildfires have occurred in late
August and September, said California Department of Forestry and
Fire Protection spokeswoman Karen Terrill.
   A series of lightning-sparked fires that began Aug. 31, 1987
burned 740,000 acres and 38 homes. Ten firefighters died.
   A blaze that at one time endangered 1,600 homes in Northern
California's Tehama County, the Finley fire, was 95 percent
contained after burning 22,980 acres. It was expected to be fully
contained by Friday.
   Forestry Department fire investigators said the largest blaze of
the siege, the 130,000-acre Campbell fire in Tehama County, may
have been ignited by a pine tree branch brushing a high-voltage
power line Aug. 6.
   Since utilities are required by law to keep trees away from
lines, state officials were considering action to recover about $10
million in fire suppression costs from the companies, including
Pacific, Gas &amp; Electric Co., which use the line.

<HEAD>Pentagon Calls In Civilian Air Fleet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 38 commercial airliners are being turned
over to the military to haul troops and cargo, the first time in
history part of the U.S. civil air fleet has been diverted for this
purpose, the Pentagon announced Friday night.
   The decision was made by the commander-in-chief of the U.S.
Transportation Command and Military Airlift Command, Gen. H.T.
Johnson, to meet the ``growing airlift requirements'' for U.S.
forces deployed in the Middle East, a Defense Department statement
said.
   The move means that as many as 38 civilian airplanes may be
turned over to the Pentagon to use as cargo and troop transports.
Those planes are owned by 16 airlines, which also will be providing
the crews to operate them.
   The airlift support is expected to be needed for several weeks,
the Pentagon said.
   This is the first use of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet since the
program was conceived in the 1950s. Under the program, airlines
prepare and commit specific aircraft that can be used to carry
troops and military cargo in times of crisis. The airlines are
reimbursed.
   The program includes 29 airlines but in this first initial stage
of the program only 16 carriers are involved, the statement said.
It did not identify the airlines involved.
   Johnson's action activates the lowest stage of the program.
   The program is designed with three stages so the airlift command
can ``tailor the airlift force needed for any contingency,'' the
Pentagon statement said.
   The initial stage calls for the civilian airlines that are part
of the program to provide planes within 24 hours of the request.
   The planes will be used to augment the Military Airlift
Command's routine overseas missions as well as for operations in
the Middle East, the statement said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, asked why the Pentagon was
forced to make the move, said Gen. Johnson ``needs more planes.''
   Military commanders at the Pentagon had begun to complain that
they weren't capable of moving enough of their troops quickly
because of transportation shortages, even though the troops were
fully ready to go to Saudi Arabia.

   When Bush announced the U.S. military operation in the gulf Aug.
8, he said it was ``purely defensive'' and aimed at protecting
America's vital interest in the Saudi oil fields, which provide 15
percent of U.S. oil imports.
   Bush said his ultimate goal was to get the Iraqis out of Kuwait
and restore the Kuwaiti royal family to power. But he has not ruled
out the use of U.S. force to try to dislodge the Iraqi army from
Kuwait.
   Iraq's statement that it intended to hold onto citizens of
``aggressive nations'' also could change the American game plan.
When U.S. troops invaded Panama in December, Bush cited, among
other things, reports that Panamanian troops were harassing
Americans.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who helped persuade Saudi Arabia
to accept a U.S.-led force on its soil, was bound for Riyadh on
Friday to visit U.S. troops standing guard in the Saudi desert
against a possible thrust by Iraq.
   Saddam massed tens of thousands of troops on Kuwait's southern
border after invading the emirate, prompting fears that he intended
to invade Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter.
   In addition to the thousands of American soldiers now in Saudi
Arabia, Pentagon sources say the Marines are building to a force of
45,000 to counter an Iraqi army now believed to have grown to
160,000 in Kuwait. U.S. military planners also are preparing to put
250,000 soldiers on the ground if necessary.
   For many of the U.S. soldiers, the intense heat of the Saudi
desert is difficult to cope with. ``The guys sure would like a cold
one,'' an Air Force captain said Thursday from the sun-drenched
tarmac of a Saudi air base.
   ``Tell the folks back home to send in the Budweiser plane,'' an
Army tank gunner said.
   In addition to the U.S. soldiers flooding the region, American
naval and Air Force firepower is growing beyond the strictly
defensive role that Bush described when he offered to protect Saudi
Arabia.
   The clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities was
the departure Thursday from Langley Air Force Base, Va., of F-117A
Stealth fighter bombers. The Stealths are designed to penetrate
heavily defended areas to attack vital targets.
   In Iraq, they could hit supply depots or key oil facilities.
   Military sources in Washington say plans called for sending 22
of the radar-evading fighter bombers to the Persian Gulf area.
   An armada of Marine Corps amphibious assault ships also is
heading for the region. The seaborne assault units, equipped with
amphibious tracked vehicles that can travel on land at speeds of up
to 50 mph.
   The Air Force says B-52 bombers, which conducted massive bombing
raids in the Vietnam War, also have been sent overseas since the
gulf crisis started.

   The FBI investigated allegations that the son
of U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh used marijuana and cocaine
as recently as 1988, but the Justice Department said Friday the
allegations were ``unsubstantiated.''
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said the FBI
investigation was closed earlier this week after two friends of
William Thornburgh were questioned about allegations that they had
seen him use drugs.
   ``Both people who were interviewed said they never used cocaine
with Bill Thornburgh. That's from the FBI reports,'' Eramian said,
in an unusual public statement about the status of an
investigation. He added that the probe also found no evidence of
marijuana use.
   Referring to the allegations, Eramian said, ``Appropriate
inquiry found them to be unsubstantiated. Bill Thornburgh is not
the subject of an investigation. The matter is closed.''
   Eramian also criticized former state Auditor General Don Bailey,
who first made the allegations, and accused him of having a
political motivation stemming from disagreements when Dick
Thornburgh was Pennsylvania's governor. He said Bailey was not
interviewed by the FBI.
   Sources familiar with the case said investigators interviewed
the two friends one time each during the last week.
   Eramian said the two men were apparently the only people
interviewed by the FBI after the case was referred to the
Harrisburg office by the Justice Department's criminal division.
   The investigation grew out of a 15-month-long drug probe that
has resulted in guilty pleas to cocaine charges by two former
deputy state attorneys general and the indictment on four
cocaine-related charges of Henry Barr, a former top aide to
Thornburgh in Harrisburg and at the U.S. Justice Department.
   The allegations against the younger Thornburgh were first made
by former Pennsylvania Auditor General Don Bailey in a July 17
letter to U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
   In his letter, Bailey identified the two men who allegedly used
drugs with Thornburgh, and asked that a special prosecutor be
appointed to study the entire drug investigation. Specter made the
request for an independent prosecutor but earlier this week the
Justice Department rejected it.
   The allegations in Bailey's letter include cocaine use during a
Harrisburg party in December 1988. At the time, William Thornburgh
was in the Navy and his father was President Reagan's attorney
general.
   Thornburgh has continued serving as attorney general for
President Bush and has been a hard-liner in the war against drugs.
   William Thornburgh, still in the Navy, could not be reached
Friday.
   Eramian said Attorney General Thornburgh was not aware of the
inquiry because he recused himself from the case when Barr first
surfaced as a target earlier this year.
   He said the probe of Bailey's allegations was thorough. He added
it was not unusual to close an investigation after only one week
and two interviews that found no evidence of wrongdoing. He also
lashed out at Bailey for making the allegations.
   ``For a number of years, Mr. Bailey has engaged in personal,
vicious, reckless and unfounded allegations against a number of
persons with whom he has been at odds on a personal and political
basis, including (former) Governor Thornburgh,'' Eramian said.
``But to spread a reckless story about a person's child is beyond
all bounds of decency.''
   In a related matter, Eramian said FBI agents questioned Dick
Thornburgh about Barr last week. Other Justice Department officials
who were also questioned said agents asked about Barr's work at the
department and whether there were any signs of drug use.
   Gordon Zubrod, the federal prosecutor heading the drug
investigation, said he could not comment on any of the developments.

   A federal judge Friday threw out a major portion of
the claims by former Contra supply courier Eugene Hasenfus and said
he may consider additional changes before the case goes to the jury.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins leaves only
certain financial claims in the case.
   Atkins said he may consider additional directed verdict motions
by lawyers for defendants Southern Air Transport and Iran-Contra
figure Richard Secord. The jury is expected to begin deliberations
Monday.
   Atkins ruled that jurors cannot consider damages for mental
stress suffered by Hasenfus or his wife, Sally. He also removed
claims of negligence and misrepresentation by Hasenfus and the
family of the late Wallace Sawyer Jr.
   Atkins threw out punitive damage claims by Hasenfus and Sawyer,
but said he could consider whether to reinstate the claim by Mrs.
Hasenfus.
   Hasenfus and Sawyer were aboard a cargo plane shot down over
Nicaragua in October 1986 while on a covert flight to supply Contra
rebels. Hasenfus, of Marinette, Wis., was the only survivor and was
jailed by Nicaraguan authorities.
   The judge let stand claims by Hasenfus for back salary, as well
as the issue of whether Sawyer's family should receive death
benefits.
   Also remaining in the case is the question of whether the
defendants should pay for Mrs. Hasenfus' legal expenses to free her
husband in Nicaragua and reimburse her for travel expenses.
   But Thomas Spencer, an attorney for Secord, said he was
confident a jury would find there was not an official employee
contract with Hasenfus or Sawyer of Magnolia, Ark.
   ``There was never any proof they were the employers,'' he said.
``Our position is that the employer is Ronald Reagan.''
   Secord, who helped former National Security Council aide Oliver
North organize the Contra supply network, pleaded guilty to lying
to Congress for his part in the Iran-Contra affair and is serving
two years probation.

   NASA engineers successfully capped a
daylong battle to stay in touch with Magellan on Friday after the
balky spacecraft's first pictures of Venus showed old lava flows,
cinder cones and faults created by ``Venusquakes.''
   After repeatedly losing and regaining contact with Magellan,
engineers sent a computer command to the spaceship Friday night
that restored regular communications at 7:11 p.m. PDT, said Tommy
Thompson, Magellan science manager at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' he said. `It was just like the
home team scoring a touchdown.''
   Thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with
Magellan except when it flys behind Venus, when it normally is
unable to send or receive radio signals from Earth.
   An unknown problem made Magellan lose its radio link with Earth
on Thursday night as it orbited Venus 147 million miles from Earth.
Almost 15 hours later, as engineers held a news conference,
Magellan official Steve Wall rushed into the room to announce
contact had been re-established.
   But as the hours passed, NASA tracking stations in California,
Australia and Spain lost and regained Magellan's radio signal
because of built-in safety programs in the spacecraft's computers.
   When Magellan first dropped out of contact, sophisticated
computer programs put it in a protective ``safing mode'' so that
its solar panels pointed to the sun to draw power. Hours later, the
safety system made the spacecraft rotate until its antenna located
Earth and resumed communications, JPL spokesman Jim Doyle said.
   The spacecraft was programmed to keep rotating, which explained
why controllers kept losing and regaining contact, Doyle said.
   The command sent to Magellan on Friday night stopped the
spacecraft from rotating and kept its secondary antenna in
continuous communication with Earth except when the spacecraft is
behind Venus, Thompson said.
   Thompson said Magellan will be kept in its protective mode until
the cause of the initial loss of contact is understood and fixed.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear was optimistic the problem
wouldn't seriously affect Magellan's $744 million mission to use
radar to make the best pictures and maps yet of Venus'
cloud-covered landscape.
   ``I have faith in the spacecraft,'' he said, admitting he was
surprised by the trouble.
   The communications problem developed shortly after Magellan
bounced radar waves off Venus for its first test pictures of
Earth's nearest planetary neighbor. The information used to make
the pictures was sent to Earth before contact was lost.
   ``We've got some raw images that look pretty damn good,'' Spear
said, adding the pictures would be released early next week despite
NASA's initial plans to wait until September.
   Project scientist Steve Saunders, who examined the pictures,
said they show old, hardened ``lava flows and faults and fractures
and (volcanic) cinder cones with craters on top.''
   ``The kind of faulting we see would certainly mean there are
Venusquakes,'' Saunders said.
   Earlier Soviet and U.S. spacecraft also revealed volcanic
features on Venus, although Magellan's images are supposed to be 10
times more detailed.
   Magellan won't be able to learn if any Venusian volcanoes are
active for at least eight months. That's because it must pass over
the same area of Venus twice before it can determine if the
landscape has been altered by an eruption.
   Saunders said Thursday's radar test returned far more pictures
than expected, covering several areas of the planet about 1,000
miles long by 15 miles wide. During normal mapping, which had been
scheduled to start Aug. 29, Magellan will make pictures of
noodle-shaped swaths of Venusian landscape about 10,000 miles long
by 15 or 16 miles wide. Those will be assembled into bigger
pictures.
   Magellan's headaches were the latest for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which recently grounded its
shuttle fleet temporarily because of hydrogen leaks and had its
Hubble Space Telescope seriously impaired by a focusing flaw in a
mirror.
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
and went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout 948
million-mile journey.
   Wall said engineers were out of contact with Magellan on
Thursday night as it turned away from Earth to get a fix on two
stars, a calibration the spaceship routinely performs to make sure
it can point properly.
   Magellan's radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain.
   ``The assumption is that after it made a star calibration, it
looked at the wrong star and then couldn't point back to Earth
accurately,'' said Doyle. ``Then, the contact was lost.''
   Engineers believe Magellan detected some onboard problem, then
went into its protective mode. Spear said the spaceship probably
tried to get a fix on a ``guide star'' so it could figure out which
way it was pointing, but may have picked the wrong star or been
confused by stray sunlight reflecting off Venus.
   ``Most of us have been up most of the night'' dealing with the
problem, Spear said Friday.
   Venus is covered by thick clouds that prevent optical cameras
from viewing its landscape. Magellan radar is designed to send
radar waves through the clouds, then collect the reflected radar
echoes and send them to Earth in digital form. Computers at JPL
then can assemble them into maps and pictures.
   The spacecraft's radar was designed to distinguish surface
features as small as two football fields.

   President Bush has decided to call
up military reserves to meet shortages of doctors, cargo handlers
and other specialists in the Persian Gulf crisis, officials said
Friday.
   In the tense gulf, Navy commanders operating under new orders to
intercept ships carrying goods to or from Iraq stopped two Iraqi
vessels off the coast of Bahrain, the Pentagon reported. The ships
were allowed to proceed after U.S. forces determined they carried
no goods, the statement said. The ships were not boarded.
   Separately, Bush protested that Iraqi attempts to move American
civilians around Iraq and Kuwait violated international law.
   The president made his decision to draw on some of the nation's
1.2 million reservists as the U.S. military continued a massive
troop and hardware movement to the tense gulf region.
   The Pentagon, meantime, announced that up to 38 commercial
airliners owned by 16 carriers are being turned over to the
military to transport troops and cargo to the gulf region. The move
is unprecedented in U.S. civil aviation history.
   One administration official said of the decision on reserves,
``In principle it's been decided, but the details are still being
worked out. ... It's just a question of how many folks they're
going to call up and who they are. They're wrangling about that
right now.''
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions that up to
80,000 Army reservists and smaller numbers of personnel from other
military reserve branches could be called to active duty if
recommendations to Bush were followed.
   Announcement of the decision was delayed because paperwork had
not yet arrived at Bush's vacation home from the Pentagon, where
military officials had requested the call-up.
   The administration brushed off criticism from United Nations
Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar about the U.S. use of a
barricade to enforce sanctions against Iraq. ``We believe it's
fully authorized,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fresh concerns were raised about the safety of Americans after
35 U.S. citizens were removed from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad and
taken to an undisclosed location, most likely another hotel.
Fitzwater said there was some indication the Iraqis wanted to keep
them away from the news media.
   ``We consider it a matter of serious concern,'' Fitzwater said.
   The vacationing Bush, teeing up for a 7 a.m. golf game, told
reporters, ``I don't think anybody ought to be moved against their
will in contravention of international law.''
   American diplomats in Baghdad believe the Americans may have
been taken to the Melia Monsour, a hotel where British citizens are
being detained. But Iraqi authorities prevented the embassy
officials from entering the hotel to check, Richard Boucher, a
State Department spokesman, said in Washington.
   Asked whether a hostage situation was developing, Boucher said
``I can't speculate at this point.''
   Later in the day, the White House declined comment on an
assertion by the speaker of Iraq's parliament that Iraq will hold
all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' until the threat of war
against his country ends. He said they would be spread throughout
the country, housed in military and civilian targets.
   Meanwhile, a group of nine foreigners, including three
Americans, bolted across the Kuwaiti desert to the Saudi Arabian
border town of Khafji in an effort to avoid an Iraqi order to
gather at a downtown hotel, reported Stephanie McGehee, an American
stringer for The Associated Press, who was in the group.
   The State Department said food available on open markets to the
3,000 or so Americans in Iraq and Kuwait was diminishing.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
repeated that the Americans in those countries wouldn't be harmed.
``I can assure you they are well treated and will be released in
due time,'' he said.
   The massive buildup of American military power in the gulf
continued in response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and to
what the administration sees as a threat to the oil-rich kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. The deployment now includes stealth fighter-bombers,
Marine amphibious assault units and other forces normally used for
offense.
   Fitzwater said the Pentagon had asked Bush to authorize a
selective callup of reservists. The president is authorized to put
a maximum of 200,000 reservists on active duty for 180 days, but
Fitzwater said a massive callup was not anticipated.
   ``We'll try to keep this as small as possible,'' the spokesman
said.
   ``In recent years, Congress has allocated more and more of the
support functions for the military to the reserve forces, so that
you find a major aspect of our support in terms of cargo handlers
and doctors and medical specialists and so forth are in the
reserves,'' he said.
   The movement of Americans from the Rashid Hotel in Baghdad
followed a threatened roundup of U.S. citizens in Iraqi-occupied
Kuwait a day earlier.
   Fitzwater said the idea of gathering the Americans in one
location appeared to have fizzled. A handful of Americans, five or
six, showed up at the appointed hotel but were told by the staff
there ``they had no idea what this was all about.''
   To this point, the Bush administration has challenged any
suggestion the 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait were
hostages.
   Fitzwater said that Iraqi officials, when questioned about the
35 Americans in Baghdad, ``told us that they are safe but have not
given us any explanation why they were moved or where they are.''
   He said, ``We are also discussing this matter with the other
nations who have people in Baghdad ... to try to get everyone to
work in concert in bringing diplomatic pressure on Baghdad to make
sure that these citizens are safe and accounted for.''
   Fitzwater said there are as many as 3 million foreigners in
Kuwait and Iraq from many countries.
   ``They all are essentially in the same situation, which is that
they have freedom of movement, they are being treated relatively
well under the circumstances or at least have not been singled out
for harassment but they have not been allowed to leave.''
   Bush will return to the White House Sunday night and meet Monday
morning with budget aides and Energy Secretary James Watkins to
discuss the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis on U.S. energy
reserves. Bush will address the Veterans of Foreign War convention
in Baltimore later Monday and make a campaign trip to Rhode Island
before returning to Kennebunkport.
   In military deployment announcements, the Pentagon said Friday:
   _Elements of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division and 2nd Armored
Division from Fort Hood, Texas, have begun preparing to leave for
the Middle East.
   _Nine of the Military Sealift Command's Ready Reserve Force
ships have been activated and are moving to loading ports in
support of the Saudi operation.
   _The Air Force has sent four Air Transportable Hospitals to the
Persian Gulf area. Medical personnel and equipment have come from
MacDill Air Force Base, Fla., Langley Air Force Base, Va., Shaw Air
Force Base, S.C., and Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C. An Air
Transportable Hospital from Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, S.C., also
is preparing to leave.

<HEAD>Nervous SoCal Residents Snatch Up Gas Masks</HEAD>

   Army-Navy surplus stores are reporting a run
on gas masks by Southern Californians apparently fearful that Iraq
could extend its use of poison gas to the United States.
   ``Most are afraid that Iraq is going to send terrorists over to
this country and they want to be prepared for any chemical
warfare,'' said Michael Sherman, owner of South Coast Army and Navy
Surplus in Newport Beach.
   His store usually sells about two to three masks a week, mostly
to people who work with spray paint or pesticides.
   ``Lately, we've been selling about 20 a week,'' Sherman said.
The masks are Israeli army issue, sell for $9.95 _ and don't come
with any guarantees of effectiveness against poison gas, he said.
   ``We can't say they're going to do anything because of the
liability situation. We sell them as novelty items,'' Sherman said.
   A more serious, and expensive, model is available at Orange Army
Navy store. The $115 mask is chemical resistant and is the same
type the military uses, said store manager Dave Tipple.
   Tipple said sales jumped immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Iraq used poison gas in its conflict with Iran and also
against ethnic Kurds in Iraq.
   Jeff Miller's HQ Army Navy Store in downtown Los Angeles has
been bombarded by callers asking for gas masks. But Miller said
restraint was in order.
   ``Unless the Iraqi government decides to send a fleet up to
Marina del Rey, we don't think anyone will need it. I haven't seen
the Iraqi flotilla off the marina,'' said Miller.

   The Security Council on Friday expressed
``anxiety'' over the fate of foreigners trapped in Kuwait and Iraq
and called on the U.N. secretary-general to take all necessary
steps to help them.
   Hundreds of thousands of foreigners, including about 4,000
Britons and 2,500 Americans, were stranded when Iraq overran Kuwait
on Aug. 2. Another 500 Americans were in Iraq.
   Late Friday, the speaker of Iraq's parliament, Sadi Mahdi, said
Iraq will hold all foreigners from ``aggressive nations'' until the
threat of war against his country ends. His statement was carried
by the official Iraqi news agency and monitored in Nicosia.
   He said those foreigners would be spread throughout the country,
housed in military and civilian installations.
   On Thursday, Iraqi military authorities had ordered Americans
and Britons in Kuwait to assemble in hotels there and implied they
would be rounded up if they did not comply.
   Both Britain and the United States protested the order.
   In addition, U.S. officials are trying to find out where the
Iraqis have taken about three dozen Americans removed from a luxury
hotel in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad. White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said they were believed to have been taken to another
hotel.
   ``Clearly, we are very seriously concerned about the
Americans,'' said State Department spokesman Richard Boucher. He
spoke before Mahdi's announcement.
   Also earlier Friday, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
Thomas R. Pickering, said after a Security Council meeting that
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``should become
immediately engaged in this humanitarian crisis having to do with
foreign nationals represented in Iraq and Kuwait.''
   British Ambassador Crispin Tickell told reporters: ``We want the
secretary-general to do all he can in a private way.''
   He said more than 1 million nationals of other countries are
living and working in Iraq and Kuwait and ``find themselves in ...
painful circumstances today.''
   The Security Council, after meeting in closed session, said its
members ``express their concern and anxiety'' over the foreign
nationals' status and asked the secretary-general to take ``all
steps considered appropriate.''
   The statement was given by the Security Council's president,
Aurel Dragos Munteanu of Romania.
   Perez de Cuellar has already been asked by the European
Community to send an envoy to the region to investigate and help
secure the release of foreigners.
   In other action at the United Nations on Friday, a special
Security Council committee convened to discuss compliance with the
U.N. embargo against Iraq.
   A three-country committee, meeting in closed session, discussed
an interim report on compliance dozens of the 159 U.N. member
states. It also was expected to discuss violations and enforcement,
but was not expected to call for a U.N. blockade at this time.
   The committee, headed by Finland and joined by Colombia and
Canada, also was consulting with the rest of the 15-member council.
   Perez de Cuellar said the use of military power to enforce U.N.
sanctions against Iraq violates the U.N. charter unless the
Security Council approves it. His comments Thursday challenged the
reason for the U.S.-led naval barricade of Iraq.
   American officials have said the U.S.-led multinational force is
acting in line with the U.N. sanctions.
   In response to Perez de Cuellar's challenge, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday, ``We obviously believe that
Article 51 (of the U.N. Charter) authorizes our intercept
activities. We believe the U.N. understands that.''
   President Bush on Thursday signed an order instructing U.S. ship
commanders in the Middle East to intercept all ships carrying goods
to or from Iraq or Kuwait. He authorized ship commanders to use the
``minimum force necessary'' to stop any ship suspected of carrying
goods to or from Kuwait or Iraq.
   If the three-nation committee decides the boycott is not being
honored, the Security Council can declare a military blockade and
appeal to member states to enforce it.
   The Soviet Union has been pressing for a broader U.N. role in
controlling regional conflicts. It said Friday it would participate
in a military operation in the Persian Gulf under the U.N. flag.

   Britain on Thursday blocked the departure of a
munitions cargo bound for Jordan.
   The Yugoslav-registered Tara, a heavy-duty merchant ship, was
being loaded in Hull, northeast England, and was to have sailed
within days for Aqaba, Jordan.
   But a spokeswoman for Britain's Department of Trade and Industry
said Thursday the export license for the cargo was revoked pending
investigation.
   The department asked customs officers to review paperwork ``to
make double-sure that everything is in order.''
   The investigation will ``take as long as it takes'' and no date
for renewing the license has been set, the spokeswoman said.
   Aside from its being a munitions cargo, the department gave no
details.
   Peter Mann, spokesman for London-based shipping agent Cowell
Nicola, which is handling the consignment, confirmed earlier that
the cargo was cleared and licensed for export to the Jordanian
government.
   Aqaba is now Iraq's only outlet. President Bush indicated the
U.S. Navy will bar Aqaba to Iraqi ships following Iraq's Aug. 2
conquest of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Florida Agrees To Change `Accident' to `Crash' In Victory For MADD</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It's no accident when a drunken driver
gets into a car wreck, Florida officials have conceded in a
war-of-words victory for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It's a
crash.
   Florida state troopers and the Department of Highway Safety and
Motor Vehicles will no longer refer to collisions between vehicles
as ``accidents.'' Partly because of pressure from MADD, they're now
known as ``crashes.''
   ```Accidents' implies that the vehicles are out there acting
independently through some unseen forces,'' said department
spokesman Ed Birk. ``There's almost always a human factor and a
human reason behind the crash.''
   The department has begun referring to all collisions as
``crashes,'' not just those involving drunks, Birk said. But he
conceded that years of coaxing from MADD played a big part in the
decision.
   The anti-drunken driving organization has long sought to
convince governments and news reporters that wrecks involving
alcohol aren't accidents.
   ``It is important that people not think of it as something that
couldn't be helped,'' said Betty Jane Spencer of Florida MADD.
``Some of them are accidents, but not drunk driving.''
   Florida state troopers were told in a July 18 memo from Director
Bobby Burkett to begin using the word ``crash'' in all
correspondence and when they speak about a collision publicly.
   The just-published book of statewide statistics on wrecks has
been retitled ``Florida Traffic Crash Facts'' and the former
Traffic Accident Report forms used by police agencies across the
state will soon be known as Traffic Crash Report forms.
   ``A vast majority of crashes are not accidents,'' Birk said.
``There's a human being behind the wheel that's got to be
responsible.''
   The only other state to adopt ``crash'' as the official word for
a car wreck is Missouri, said MADD national President Mickey Sadoff.
   ``For 10 years we've fought for this word change, because to
call it an accident seems to absolve people of responsibility,''
she said. ``By calling it a crash, you are elevating it to show
it's a preventable violent crime.''
   Mrs. Spencer, who lost four children in a drunken-driving wreck,
said MADD members often write letters to newspapers and TV stations
when reporters refer to such collisions as accidents.
   ``It's very offensive to people who have lost loved ones to call
it an accident,'' she said. ``I think now that the state is
starting to use `crash,' the news people will start feeling more
comfortable with it.''
   There were 36,312 alcohol-related collisions in Florida in 1989,
down from 37,800 the year before, according to the new ``Crash
Facts'' book. Almost 1,500 people died in those collisions, which
represented 14.4 percent of total wrecks.

<HEAD>Government, Mohawks Hold First Talks in Canadian Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government and Mohawk negotiators opened their
first formal talks Thursday to settle a territorial dispute that
has prompted the Indians to take up arms and touched off protests
nationwide.
   The Indian negotiators slipped out a back door after Thursday's
talks, and government negotiators were tight-lipped. However,
federal negotiator Bernard Roy told reporters ``nothing nefarious''
should be read into the meeting's mid-afternoon termination.
   ``It simply has to do with the fact that the Mohawks have
certain customs and they are not to conduct negotiations after
sundown,'' Roy told reporters.
   The talks are aimed at defusing a five-week-old standoff between
Indians and authorities at Oka, a town 18 miles west of Montreal.
The Indians are trying to block a golf course addition on land they
claim as ancestral.
   On July 11, Quebec provincial authorities stormed a Mohawk
barricade at Oka, and an officer was killed in the shootout. It has
not been established who shot the officer.
   In sympathy with the Indians in Oka, other Mohawks blocked a
bridge between Montral and its southern suburbs. That blockade has
angered thousands of commuters bereft of their main link to
Montreal and ignited angry protests by local residents.
   Neither Mohawks nor government officials commented on the
substance of the talks Thursday at a hotel in suburban Dorval.
   Roy, the federal negotiator, said the three parties agreed to
impose a news blackout on negotiations.

   About 7,000 evacuees crossed overland into
Jordan from Iraq and Kuwait on Thursday, as three European foreign
ministers warned here that Iraqi refusal to let Westerners leave
may worsen the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The visiting ministers asked this kingdom to intercede with
Baghdad to allow up to 20,000 Westerners to leave Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Egypt's official Middle East News Agency meanwhile quoted people
fleeing Iraq as reporting an abortive assassination attempt was
made against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, followed by mass
arrests.
   Iraq denied the report.
   The great majority of evacuees reaching Jordan Thursday were
Arabs, mainly Egyptians, but included three U.S. citizens of Indian
origin, three Bangladeshis with dual British and Bangladeshi
nationality, and a Frenchwoman, a senior Jordanian security
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The seven were the first Westerners to be allowed to leave since
Saturday, when Iraq said Westerners were ``restrictees'' until the
situation clarifies.
   Included among the Westerners stranded by Iraq's blitz takeover
of Kuwait on Aug. 2 are roughly 3,000 Americans.
   Italy's foreign minister, Gianni de Michelis, addressed a joint
news conference at the Royaopen to Iraq-bound
goods and to evacuees.
   King Hussein met President Bush in Maine for two hours Thursday
on a possible diplomatic settlement of the crisis.
   De Michelis said the EC would be ready to provide economic
assistance to Jordan to help it meet any hardships the sanctions
might entail.
   A U.S. Embassy diplomat confirmed that three U.S. citizens
crossed at Ruweishid, about 205 miles northeast of Amman, Thursday.
   The diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified one
of the three as Bassem T. Hajbeh. He declined to identify the other
two, saying they cited the privacy act.
   The Jordanian security official said the three were transitting
Baghdad Airport for India when Iraq invaded Kuwait and closed its
airspace.

   Iranian dissident Farhad Behbehani could face the
death sentence after making a purported confession on TV, Amnesty
International said Thursday. It said it believed he was coerced
into making the Aug. 6 statement.
   Behbehani was detained with more than 20 others in June by
Tehran authorities, and Amnesty said in a statement it feared that
others held with him may be forced to make similar televised
statements.
   Some of them were reported in poor health, the international
human rights organization added.
   Behbehani belongs to the opposition Association for the Defense
of Freedom and Sovereignty of the Iranian Nation and is a signatory
to an open letter critical of Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Amnesty said Behbehani talked at length in the televised
statement about alleged connections between the association and
foreign governments, including purported cooperation with the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency.
   The organization this month called for the release of Behbehani
and other prisoners it said were arrested solely for peacefully
exercising basic rights.

   B-52 bombers left a California air base for an overseas
assignment as the Middle East crisis continued, and an Army convoy
headed for Saudi Arabia was saluted by hundreds of flag-waving
Americans standing along a highway.
   A second Navy hospital ship headed out to sea en route for the
Mideast.
   Four more warships left military harbors in Virginia on
Thursday. The guided-missile cruisers USS Mississippi and USS San
Jacinto left the Norfolk Naval Base to catch up with the six other
ships of the John F. Kennedy carrier battle group, which left
Wednesday, according to Lt. Cmdr. Carrie Hartshorne, an Atlantic
Fleet spokeswoman.
   In other military movements Thursday, the tank landing ship USS
Saginaw and the dock landing ship USS Pensacola left Little Creek
Amphibious Base near Norfolk.
   The B-52 deployment was confirmed by Col. Eugene Famulare,
commander of the 93rd Bombardment Wing at Castle Air Force Base at
Merced, Calif.
   ``We have deployed several bombers overseas from Castle,''
Famulare said Wednesday in response to a reporter's question. ``We
have deployed B-52 aircraft and will deploy the first tanker
tomorrow (Thursday) and will deploy people and equipment.''
   The tanker _ a KC-135 normally used to fuel B-52s _ was to fly
up to 50 airmen overseas to an unspecified site.
   ``The locations we deploy troops to, at this point, are
classified,'' Famulare said. He also refused to specify the
destination or number of B-52s dispatched from the base about 120
miles southeast of San Francisco.
   However, Famulare did say that enough bombers had left to
temporarily reduce Castle's ability to train crews, one of its
primary functions.
   On the ground, hundreds of people lined Interstates 24 and 75
from Monteagle, Tenn., to Dalton, Ga., at the urging of a local
radio station Wednesday, waving flags and carrying banners while
members of the 101st Airborne Division passed. The troop convoy was
passing through on its way to Florida and Saudi Arabia.
   At a refueling stop in Monteagle, Sgt. Roger Roe from Massillon,
Ohio, said he was surprised by the response.
   ``People have really been supportive. It makes me think about
Vietnam. Of course, I was too young to go then, but this seems to
be just the opposite,'' Roe said.
   After several delays, the Navy hospital ship Mercy weighed
anchor Wednesday night at Oakland, Calif., en route to the Persian
Gulf.
   The 69,360-ton ship's carried some 70 military airlift personnel
and 800 people from the Oakland Naval Hospital, said Robert Borden,
military sealift command spokesman. About 1,200 medical personnel
were originally scheduled on the mission, but a staffing shortage
at the Oakland hospital prevented them from heading toward the
Mideast. The Navy said additional hospital workers might be flown
to the ship after it reaches the Mideast.
   Another Navy hospital ship, the Comfort, left its home port of
Baltimore on Aug. 11 and set out from the Navy base at Norfolk on
Wednesday.
   A ``gung ho'' attitude is surfacing among some standby forces.
Thousands of Georgia's military reservists are patiently waiting
for a possible call-up but others have been less patient.
   ``We've had a hell of a lot of reservists calling saying, `I'll
volunteer if you are looking for anybody.' We call it the Rambo
list,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Bill Schubert, spokesman for the Naval
Reserve Readiness Command Region 8 at Jacksonville (Fla.) Naval Air
Station, which supervises Naval Reserve forces throughout southern
Georgia and Florida.
   President Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met Tuesday to
discuss activating part of the nation's military reserve. No
decision was made, a Pentagon spokesman said.
   Among other military unit activity:
   _ In Alabama,one of four ships being prepared to help ferry
troops and equipment to the Persian Gulf region sailed out of
Mobile Bay on Thursday to an unknown destination.
   _ The Air Force said its 94th Tactical Airlift Wing based at
Dobbins Air Force Base in Marietta, Ga., would be deployed over the
next few days to Southwest Asia to provide tactical airlift support
to the U.S. military operation in the Middle East.
   _ North Dakota's two Air Force bases were called to support the
U.S. military move into the Middle East. Troops and KC-135 planes
were deployed from the Grand Forks Air Force Base, said spokesman
Lt. Lindsey Borg.
   The Minot Air Force base also was mobilizing personnel and
KC-135s as well, according to a statement, which did not disclose
other details.
   _ Members of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss in
El Paso, Texas, were being deployed to the Middle East, a post
spokesman said Thursday.
   _ At Camp Lejeune, N.C., about 17,000 Marines were being moved
to the Middle East, the largest deployment of troops since the mid
1960s, said Lt. Gen. Carl Mundy, a three-star general.
   _ The 197th Infantry Brigade from Fort Benning, Ga., also is
headed for the Middle East, the Pentagon confirmed late Wednesday.
   _ The 314th Tactical Airlift Wing at Little Rock Air Force Base
has sent both personnel and supplies to the Middle East, officials
say, forcing postponement of an open house the base had scheduled
for Sept. 8-9.
   _ Marines at Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina
were stacking and loading equipment Thursday in preparation for
going to the Middle East. It was announced Wednesday that elements
of the 2nd Marine Air Wing and the 2nd Force Service Support Group
at the air station were going.

<HEAD>Nuclear Regulatory Commission Investigating Seabrook Licensing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is
investigating its decision to license the Seabrook nuclear plant
amid claims that its licensing board was pressured to overlook
safety concerns.
   Seabrook opponents welcomed the move as long overdue.
   ``I think it's a great idea,'' Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
said Thursday. ``I have long felt that the licensing process has
been corrupted by political pressures and that some decisions have
not been objective.''
   Roy Morrison, a spokesman for the anti-nuclear Clamshell
Alliance, said Seabrook opponents hope the investigation will turn
up the corruption and misconduct they long have alleged.
   ``The whole process has been a scandal. We have an agency that's
been in a moral vacuum,'' Morrison said. ``The reasonable thing
that should be done is the license should be suspended until a full
investigation is completed.''
   Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said plant officials are confident
the investigation will turn up no improprieties.
   ``Seabrook Station has been the most closely scrutinized nuclear
plant ever licensed with respect to the safety of the plant and the
adequacy of the emergency response plans,'' he said.
   David Williams, the NRC's inspector general, is investigating
the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board's decision to recommend
Seabrook's licensing, according to documents made public Wednesday.
The recommendation, long delayed by concerns about evacuation plans
for nearby communities, paved the way for the NRC to grant a
commercial operating license on March 15.
   The board recommended licensing even though appeals by
anti-nuclear activists had not been decided. The opponents claim
there is no way to evacuate the area adequately in an emergency.
   The Seabrook opponents' appeal did not preclude the atomic
safety board from issuing the operating license, according to Ivan
Smith, chairman of the licensing board.
   But state House Minority Leader Mary Chambers, a Democrat, said
the investigation should center on what occurred between Nov. 9,
when by some accounts the licensing board was not ready to go
ahead, and Nov. 13, when it announced its favorable decision.
   ``They don't believe it's possible to evacuate the area and then
four days later change their minds? Something happened there,'' she
said. Chambers said she doesn't know ``whether it was corruption or
not, but it clearly looks like there was some pressure brought to
bear.''
   Morrison was more blunt.
   ``It's pretty obvious that through the whole process the NRC was
in the tank and that Ivan Smith took a dive,'' he said. ``(Smith)
did have some concerns until he got talked to. We want to know who
talked to him.''
   Anti-nuclear activists have speculated that White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, an ardent Seabrook supporter while New Hampshire
governor, exerted some clout. Sununu has denied having any
influence over the decision.
   Leo Norton, the NRC's assistant inspector general for
investigations, wouldn't comment on what prompted the investigation
other than ``some very sensitive issues'' are involved.
   Smith refused to comment on details, but acknowledged that
Williams' investigation is highly unusual.
   ``I have never heard of any such thing as this in almost 40
years of law practice,'' he said.
   In a memo, Smith wrote that Williams seems to be trying to
determine whether ``the change was corruptly induced by NRC
officers and corruptly made by members of the licensing board.''
   If he finds wrongdoing, Williams can recommend action to the
full commission.

   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
said Thursday that Americans are unlikely to consume less fuel
unless they are hit by the likes of the 1973 oil crisis, when
motorists waited in long lines to fill their tanks.
   ``I think that's what does it,'' he said. ``I don't really
believe that the increase in price at this point has discouraged
anyone from going anywhere.''
   Lujan, who was in Albuquerque to present awards to three oil
companies, said the United States should cut its reliance on
foreign oil by easing regulations so that more domestic oil can be
extracted.
   The Bush administration has announced it will use the Persian
Gulf crisis and resulting gasoline price increases to push for oil
exploration in an Alaskan wilderness, the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.
   Lujan also said drilling should be allowed at the $2.5 billion
Point Arguello project, a $2.5 billion development about 150 miles
north of Los Angeles that has been blocked by concerns of
ecological damage.
   Lujan presented the Interior department's Payor-Reporter Award,
for diligent production reports and royalty payments, to Conoco,
the Santa Fe Energy Co. and the Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline
Co.

<HEAD>FAA: Budget Crunch May Force 35 Percent Cut in Flights</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Federal Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airlines may have to cut flight schedules up to
35 percent starting in October because of mandatory budget cuts,
the head of the Federal Aviation Administration warned Thursday.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey IV said he is planning on
drastic cutbacks if the budget impasse isn't broken by Oct. 1. At
that time, the government would implement the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law, he said.
   If Gramm-Rudman goes into effect, the FAA would have to slash
spending about 32 percent, Busey said while speaking at the Atlanta
Aero Club.
   ``That means I will have to begin furloughing members of the
work force to the extent that we will have approximately 30 percent
of our work force on furlough on any given day,'' he said. ``That
will cause a corresponding reduction in our ability to control air
traffic ... between 25 and 35 percent.''
   The administrator said he notified his work force of about
50,000 on Monday about the prospect of furloughs. Each worker would
have to take off up to 2{ normal working days each two-week pay
period.
   Memos sent this week by the Office of Personnel Management are
telling the nation's 2.4 million federal workers they could face up
to 22 days off without pay in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1,
or about one day in each two-week pay period.
   Busey said the furloughs would apply across the board to air
traffic controllers, maintenance inspectors, equipment specialists
and security officials.
   ``I don't know how to prioritize between those
responsibilities,'' he said. ``Therefore, an across-the-board
furlough mechanism is the only way I know how to manage.''
   He said he intends to discuss the contingency plans next week
with the Air Transport Association, a trade group that represents
virtually all U.S. airlines.
   Although the Bush administration and congressional leaders have
been known to play brinkmanship with the budget, time is running
out as other problems _ such as the Middle East crisis _ are
competing for Washington's front burner.
   In 1982, 42,000 federal workers were furloughed briefly in a
budget dispute between Congress and the Reagan administration.
President Bush last week exempted uniformed military personnel from
furloughs.

   Terry McDonell has been named editor in chief of
Esquire magazine, Hearst Magazines announced Thursday.
   McDonell, 46, replaces Lee Eisenberg, 44, who is relocating to
London to be the founding editor and editor in chief of the new
British edition of Esquire, scheduled to make its debut in March
1991.
   McDonell's appointment is effective September.
   He joins Esquire from Smart magazine, where he had been editor
in chief and president since launching the publication in 1988.
   Before launching Smart, McDonell was assistant managing editor
of Newsweek, with responsibility for all back-of-the-book coverage.
Prior to joining Newsweek in 1983, he spent two years with Rolling
Stone as the publication's managing editor.
   Under his direction, Rolling Stone enjoyed a dramatic rise in
circulation and received National Magazine Award nominations both
years.
   He was a founding editor of Outside magazine, introduced in
1977, and Rocky Mountain magazine, started in 1979. He began his
career with The Associated Press in New York.
   McDonell's television writing credits include ``Miami Vice'' and
``China Beach.''

   Injecting insulin glands into a transplanted
liver prevents diabetes in some patients, a procedure that could
help diabetics who have kidney damage, researchers said Thursday.
   The islets of Langerhans, the tiny insulin factories found in
the pancreas, were injected into the livers of nine patients whose
pancreases were removed at two Pittsburgh hospitals.
   All nine patients produced insulin at first and for five of
them, blood-sugar levels remained normal and insulin shots were
unnecessary, according to a study published this week in The
Lancet, a British medical journal.
   Doctors from the universities of Pittsburgh, Miami and Milan,
Italy, said FK-506, a drug that prevents rejection of transplanted
organs and glands, contributed to the operations' success.
   Gerold Grodsky, a researcher of islet gland function at the
University of California at San Francisco, called the study ``a
major step.''
   However, he cautioned that the procedure will be useful only for
people who are taking anti-rejection drugs, such as kidney
transplant recipients, a third of whom have diabetes.
   The patients in the study had lost their pancreases, spleens,
stomachs and parts of their small and large intestines to abdominal
cancer and had received liver transplants.
   The surgery next will be tried on patients with kidney damage
due to diabetes that appears early in life, an associate professor
of surgery at the University of Pittsburgh said.
   ``The real target of the research, eventually, is juvenile
diabetes, the most troublesome kind,'' said Dr. Andreas Tzakis.
   One percent of the U.S. population suffers from juvenile
diabetes, which can cause blindness, heart problems and kidney
failure. The procedure's success is less promising for them because
their bodies would reject donor glands, Grodsky said.
   More research on the body's immune system is needed before
people with juvenile diabetes, but no transplants, can be helped,
said Dr. Daniel Mintz of the University of Miami's diabetes center,
another of the study's authors.
   In the Lancet study, two patients died of infections and
multiple organ failure, and a third died after six months when his
cancer reappeared. Another patient became diabetic later.
   The researchers said the best example of how the gland
transplant works is seen in Mary Arthur, 16, of Louisville, Ky.,
who underwent a transplant in January to replace a liver diseased
with cancer.
   The transplant of the islets of Langerhans takes only 30
minutes. The cells either are injected into a small blood vessel
near the liver during surgery or delivered intravenously, the study
said.
   ``The islets seem to be making a new home in the liver, although
it's not their normal home,'' Tzakis said. ``They go there to live,
and they get a blood supply in there.''
   Preparing the islets takes four hours. The cells, comprising
only 1 percent of the pancreas and visible only with a microscope,
are removed from a dead donor's pancreas.
   Dr. Paul Lacey, a pathologist at Washington University in St.
Louis, said the study confirms results a Washington University team
published in the April issue of the journal Diabetes.
   The Washington researchers transplanted the islets of Langerhans
into a diabetic patient with kidney damage, then recorded a
reduction in blood sugar when insulin production resumed, Lacey
said.

   American firepower on the Arabian Peninsula
has grown beyond the strictly defensive role that President Bush
described nine days ago in pledging to protect Saudi Arabia from
Iraq.
   The clearest sign of a shift toward offensive capabilities is
the departure Thursday from Langley Air Force Base, Va., of F-117A
stealth fighter bombers.
   The stealth fighter-bombers, which saw their first combat action
during December's invasion of Panama, are designed to penetrate
heavily defended areas to attack vital targets. In Iraq they could
hit supply depots or key oil facilities.
   Military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said plans
called for sending 22 of the radar-evading fighter bombers to the
Persian Gulf area.

   Oil price increases are straining already tight city and state
budgets, forcing cutbacks in car and air travel by government
workers and causing fresh jitters over the possibility of a
recession.
   Most local budget officials contacted this week by The
Associated Press said it was too early to weigh the impact of oil
price increases stemming from the 2-week-old Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``There's no reason to panic at this point,'' said Verlyn
Leiker, budget director of Kansas City, Mo., who estimated that the
oil price rise has added only ``a few hundred thousand'' to that
city's $350 million budget.
   A few energy-producing states even believe they'll come out
winners if oil prices continue upward. But budget officials
elsewhere fear sustained oil price increases of 25 percent to 30
percent would almost certainly bring about deep municipal and state
service cuts.

   A thin washer may have caused the focusing
flaw in the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, and a space
shuttle mission can easily fix much of the problem, NASA officials
say.
   ``The Hubble could actually be better than it could be now,''
Charles Pellerin, NASA director of astrophysics, said Thursday.
   Pellerin and members of a NASA investigative team held a news
conference after two days of hearings at Hughes Danbury Optical
Systems Inc., maker of the flawed primary mirror that is producing
blurry pictures from the orbiting observatory.
   The mirror has an aberration caused by a 1.3-millimeter error in
a measuring device that was used to grind the telescope's mirrors,
said Lew Allen, head of the team and director of NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.

   A woman who says she has 21 personalities
displayed three of them _ herself and characters named Franny and
Jennifer _ in testifying she was raped by a man who took her out
for coffee.
   The judge required her to take an oath each time she changed
identities during the hearing Thursday. Lawyers introduced
themselves to the different personalities. Each time, she behaved
as if the testimony was just beginning.
   After hearing the testimony, Judge Robert Hawley ordered Mark A.
Peterson, 29, to stand trial for sexual assault. No trial date was
set.
   To convict Peterson, District Attorney Joseph Paulus said he
must prove three things _ that the victim had a mental illness,
that she was incapable of appraising her own conduct and that
Peterson knew about the illness.
   Peterson claims the woman consented to sex and that he did not
know she had multiple personalties. But the woman said she told
Peterson she had multiple personalities and introduced him to some
of them, and that he took advantage of one of them _ Jennifer, a
fun-loving 20-year-old.

   Actors' Equity bowed to pressure from within its
ranks and agreed to let a white actor play a Eurasian pimp in the
Broadway production of the hit London musical ``Miss Saigon.''
   Now the question is whether the show will go on.
   Producer Cameron Mackintosh, who had scrapped the $10 million
show after the union's initial ban on Jonathan Pryce, said Thursday
he will confer with the English actor and the ``Miss Saigon''
creative team to determine whether it can still be brought to
Broadway.
   A decision is not expected until next week, said Mackintosh
spokesman Marc Thibodeau.

   Actors' Equity reversed itself Thursday, and
said it would allow a white British actor to play a Eurasian in the
Broadway production of the hit London musical ``Miss Saigon.''
   The vote to approve actor Jonathan Pryce came at a special
meeting of the union's 70-member council, called in response to a
petition from more than 600 Equity members outraged by the decision
last week to bar the actor.
   ``The council determined that, indeed, Mister Pryce qualifies as
a star in accordance with the criteria established in the agreement
between Equity and the League of American Theaters and Producers,''
said Alan Eisenberg.
   The council ban of Pryce prompted the show's producer to cancel
its Broadway run and dividing the theater community.
   The producer, Cameron Mackintosh, has not said whether he would
resurrect the show if the union rescinded its order. ``Miss
Saigon'' was to begin previews here in March. Its top ticket price
was $100. Mackintosh said the cancellation of the $10 million
musical, which had a record $25 million in advance ticket sales,
would cost him about $600,000.

   U.S. gasoline prices will probably remain higher
even if foreign producers make up for the lack of crude oil from
Iraq and Kuwait, executives with one major oil company said
Thursday.
   With Kuwaiti refineries not producing, U.S. gasoline refining
capacity already is stretched tight, and much refined fuel from
other countries does not meet federal standards, they said.
   Producing nations probably could increase their crude output by
up to 3.5 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter, said one
executive, who was one of several who spoke to reporters at a
briefing given on condition that they and their company not be

<HEAD>Drought in the Business Marsh</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life in the business marsh, which ordinarily
hums with innovative little outfits that eventually grow and nip at
the heels of giant companies, is quiet these days.
   Business isn't good for beginners. Many don't even get a hearing
from the loan officer at the bank. Venture capitalists, those folks
who used to take big risks for big rewards, haven't been very
venturesome either.
   The Federal Reserve, following a tight money policy, has made
life miserable for them. And banks, fearful of regulators and often
reacting to their own earlier excesses, have all but welded the
hinges on their vaults.
   Congress has hindered rather than helped. Not only has it failed
to solve the deficit problem, it is poised now to pile on a whole
new set of regulations that can only raise costs and drive
small-business people mad.
   The regulations, all accompanied by energy-draining paperwork,
concern minimum wages, mandated health costs, mandated leaves,
mandated access for handicapped, mandated pollution controls. The
paperwork alone is full time.
   An American Express Co. survey of new-business formation showed
a 4.2 percent decline in the second half of 1989. Dun &amp; Bradstreet
Corp. says new incorporations are stagnant; in the first four
months of 1990 they totaled 236,102, down 0.9 percent from 238,306
in the year-earlier period.
   Business failures, meanwhile, are higher for the first time
since 1986. D&amp;B puts the percentage at 9.5 percent over last year,
and as usual, many of these are upstart companies. In April, the
New England failure rate was nearly triple that of a year earlier
and the Middle Atlantic rate was more than double.
   Small and beginning business is the breeding ground of
creativity, the source of new jobs, the inventor of new products
and services and the future competition for big companies that
otherwise might develop clogged arteries.
   From emerging businesses will come new ways to contain
health-care costs, new high-tech companies to solve what has
stymied the bigger guys, new products to help the balance of
payments, new marketing strategies.
   Economists accustomed to the big scene, to viewing abstract
statistics, to dealing with macro- rather than micro-economics,
often make little of the emerging-business problem. ``Everyone
suffers in a downturn,'' they say.
   Others contend, correctly, that much of the credit crunch
involves real estate and building, and that many forestalled
ventures are speculative. Whatever, they involve the future of jobs
and companies.
   No area of the economy exists in isolation.
   The construction of one house, for example, involves a thousand
economic transactions, including the purchase of raw land, payment
of fees to towns, soil testing, sewers, water mains, curbs,
gutters, streets, landscaping.
   It involves, according to the National Association of Home
Builders, 1.8 man-years of employment, including the direct
services of carpenters, plumbers, electricians, insulators,
painters, roofers, cement workers, tilers and others.
   The jobs, and the businesses involved, are by no means local.
Steelmakers, carpetmakers, furnace makers and makers of air
conditioners must ship their products from many miles away, by air,
by rail, by road.
   But it isn't just real estate and building that are being
deprived of water in the small-business marsh. It isn't only
high-tech companies either.
   When business withers at the grass roots the damage sometimes
isn't seen for a while. Big business can shout, threaten and stamp
its feet, thus getting the the attention of elected officials. The
smallest businesses might not.
   When ideas and innovations die, when inventions aren't financed,
when start-up companies aren't nourished, the signs might be barely
detectible in the national statistics.
   The economic measuring devices aren't always so perceptive that
they can detect the pulse of small business, the faint murmurs in
the business marsh.

<BYLINE>Tensions Rise as U.S. Anchor Buildup Reported in Middle East
^By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the U.S. network anchor buildup continued in
the Middle East, ABC's Peter Jennings was asked if he felt a little
lonely, staying here to anchor ``World News Tonight.''
   ``Not at all,'' said Jennings, who used to cover the Middle East
in his correspondent days. ``I'm in exactly the right place. My job
is to coordinate the coverage, not just go and do one dimension of
it.''
   He spoke last Thursday, as the network anchor total in the
Middle East rose to seven with the arrivals in Saudi Arabia of
NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Sam Donaldson, the latter there for
``PrimeTime Live.''
   It was perhaps the largest array of high-priced anchors since
the Moscow Summit of 1988, when there were so many news stars
running loose only luck prevented a high-speed interview pileup.
   But this time, they're spread out, those who have been sent to
cover and anchor, so to speak, the Middle East crisis caused by
Irag's armed takeover of Kuwait.
   They've reported from Dubai, Jordan, Cairo, Saudi Arabia, and,
in CBS' Dan Rather's case, a Navy carrier from which he anchored _
on tape _ part of one newscast. Rather and ABC's Ted Koppel also
have been the only U.S. anchors to broadcast from Baghdad yet.
NBC's Garrick Utley still is trying to get in.
   Ironically, Ted Turner's global Cable News Network hasn't sent
in an anchor star. It has stuck with its grunts, the
correspondents. Why didn't CNN send in just one of its anchors,
say, Bernard Shaw?
   ``It's because of what we are, as opposed to the other guys,''
says Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for newsgathering.
``They have half-hour shows, and if that's how they want to use
their anchors, super.''
   (It should be pointed out that Koppel and Rather have done
breaking-news bulletins and report for newscasts on their networks
other than their own, just like the lesser-known, lesser-paid
correspondents.)
   ``But this story, unlike any story I can ever remember, has so
many different locations,'' Turner says. ``And an anchor is
supposed to tie it all together from a central location.
   ``The place to do that is not downtown Baghdad, or downtown
Amman. The place to be is what you consider your news universe.''
   Jennings gives almost the same reason _ ``it's a complicated
story'' _ as the reason he's staying here.
   Koppel, the ``Nightline'' anchor, has scored good beats,
particularly by being the first U.S. network newsman into Iraq,
Jennings says, but ``I can't go off and pursue the one thing and
still run our coverage.''
   Rather, says Turner, ``is a helluva reporter. He likes doing
that, he's excited about it, and that's fine. But that's not an
anchor's job . . . if you're really anchoring, you're talking about
holding the show together.''
   Rather has been in the Middle East since the crisis began.
Brokaw started only last Thursday, when he reported for the ``NBC
Nightly News'' and anchored part of it from what seemed a palm
tree-lined oasis.
   Why the delay?
   ``We've been saying all along that if we can get into Baghdad,
Saudi Arabia or Kuwait we would go,'' says the show's executive
producer, Steve Friedman.
   Saudi Arabia, which tightly restricted correspondents' visits
even before the current Gulf crisis, gave Brokaw approval to enter
last week, likewise ABC's Donaldson.
   That approval was ``why we went in'' with Brokaw, says Friedman.
``We've been holding off because I'm not going to send Tom to a
place where I can only get a phone call'' report from the NBC
anchorman.
   With the advent of satellites, the wandering anchorman has
become almost routine. There are varied reasons for moving about,
Jennings says _ to bring attention to particular event or region,
or a single story.
   Another reason The Anchor is sent in on a major story is clout.
   The fact an anchor is well-known and has contacts with major
movers and shakers sometimes gets him interviews or into places
lesser mortals only might dream about. As Friedman puts it:
   ``An anchorman gives you cachet. Because everybody all over
knows who they are. Ted Koppel got into Baghdad because he's Ted
Koppel and worked the story.''
   Media critics, some of whom may yet cover a fire, sometimes
question the validity of anchor expeditions, calling them show-biz
moves intended more to drum up publicity and ratings for network
newscasts than to commit journalism.
   The urbane Jennings would give such carpers the back of his hand:
   ``I don't think they watch what we do. I don't think they even
look at content, or look at the reporting . . . our audience wants
to know what the hell's going on, not where any of us are standing
at any given date.
   ``My advice is to pay less attention to anchors and more to
content.''

   After growing up as an Army brat, Sandy
VonKaenel became an Army wife, and it wasn't long before her
husband was off to Vietnam.
   All that experience helps now that he's away again, in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``For those who've been associated with the Army for a lengthy
time, it's not so difficult,'' she said, taking time out from a
day-and-night schedule of activities, from ``networking'' with
other wives in support groups to distributing red, white and blue
ribbons.
   ``We knew what our husbands' jobs were. It's not a big
surprise,'' said Mrs. VonKaenel, whose husband joined the Army 21
years ago. ``For younger wives, it's more difficult.''
   Twenty-one years ago, Karen Walsh was born. Recently, when her
soldier-husband, just 23 himself, learned he would be among the
thousands deployed as part of a force to deter a possible Iraqi
invasion of Saudi Arabia, she was unprepared.
   ``I think my whole generation, I guess we're kind of naive. We
don't remember that war,'' she said, referring to Vietnam.
   ``We never really thought that this would happen. I know I never
did when he went into the Army. . . . It's hard to believe it's
actually happening.''
   This is not to say that the officer's wife is nonchalant, or
that the young specialist's wife is overwhelmed as he works long
hours preparing and she waits for him to ship out at any time.
   In both of the wives' voices is the steel of military stoicism.
In both of their laughs is the breath of nervousness.
   Both women, who spoke on the condition their husbands' first
names not be used, find some refuge in routine.
   ``Birthday parties go on. Soccer camps go on,'' said the
42-year-old Mrs. VonKaenel, who has a 13-year-old son and a
5-year-old daughter. ``School starts next week. Normal routine.''
   At the same time, there's an out-of-the-ordinary routine since
the deployment began. ``I have a family assistance meeting
tonight,'' Mrs. VonKaenel said. ``I've been on the phone all
morning.''
   During an interview, she was interrupted three times by phone
calls. Unit by unit, soldiers' spouses set up ``phone trees,'' and
she volunteered her name and number.
   An earlier call had been from a wife who has only a learner's
permit and couldn't drive alone. How could she go get groceries?
The fort's family aid office would send someone to help.
   Another call: What if the aid office didn't come? ``If they
don't, I'll come and get you,'' Mrs. VonKaenel told the woman.
   Asked if she has trouble sleeping these days, Mrs. VonKaenel
said yes, but laughed. ``Not because I can't sleep,'' she said.
``It's because I'm too busy.''
   Mrs. Walsh is getting less sleep, too. Her two children, almost
1 year old and almost 3, wake her up early, and Ted Koppel keeps
her up late.
   ``I usually stay up until `Nightline' goes off,'' she said. ``I
keep that little TV in the kitchen on all day so I can hear
anything that comes on, any reports. I've always watched a lot of
news. . . . But now I watch four or five evening newses.''
   As she spoke, her little daughter blurted, ``My daddy's in the
Army.''
   ``She sees sometimes, on the news, the Army daddies and she
asks,'' Mrs. Walsh said. Her husband could leave at any time _
``he's all packed and ready to go,'' she said.
   ``I promised myself I wouldn't cry if it happened,'' she said of
the deployment. ``Then, as it got worse, I have cried. It's not
knowing what's going on that's really bad.''
   Mrs. Walsh and her husband were high school sweethearts. Both
went to college briefly. He joined the service for the education
benefits and ``to give him discipline or something,'' his wife
said. ``He felt that he needed that.''
   ``It's not a career. He's been in longer than we planned on, but
. . .'' Her voiced trailed off and she smiled.
   He's about a year into his second hitch. The first was spent in
Colorado, far from both their families in Charlotte, N.C. Mrs.
Walsh said she's happier at Fort Bragg. ``The whole community's
centered around the Army,'' she said.
   Portable signs in front of businesses and churches bear messages
such as, ``God bless America and our soldiers overseas.'' A rock
music station plays the national anthem at noon, introduced by a
disc jockey who says, ``We're damn proud to be Americans.''
   At an intersection one day last week, a van with a bumper
sticker that read ``Army Spouses Are Special'' waited as a convoy
of a dozen boxy medics' ambulances _ olive drab with large
red-and-white crosses _ turned eastward, the direction of ports
where ships have been loading military vehicles and equipment.
   The reminders are everywhere.
   ``I was thinking earlier today, everyone else is kind of going
through their normal life,'' Mrs. Walsh said. ``It's just something
they see on TV. Maybe they think about it, but not as much as _ I
mean, we think about it all the time.''
   Feelings get mixed up. Sadness. Fear. Pride.
   ``I've just started becoming more aware of how lucky we are that
we're here, when I see all theoutheast

   The last time a voice from this tiny
crossroads town got the world's attention it was that of patriot
Patrick Henry, who's buried here. Now, it's Michael Forest's voice.
   The 27-year-old lyric tenor is singing five roles at the
Metropolitan Opera in New York this season _ from ``Porgy and
Bess'' to ``Boris Gudonov'' _ but only a decade ago, he was working
in the local tobacco fields.
   In between, he met Essex Moseley, president of the Charlotte
County Assembly, part of a network of grassroots self-help groups
being set up in poor, rural counties around the South.
   ``The assembly was sponsoring a music contest and we took
Michael down,'' Moseley said.
   And the voice? ``I was really knocked off my feet,'' he said.
   Forest, then 18 and trained only in the church choir and school
chorus, won the competition. First prize was a scholarship to the
Shenandoah Conservatory of Music in Winchester, Va.
   ``I was very lucky, to be in the right place at the right
time,'' said Forest from his Manhattan apartment, shortly after a
visit home where he sang in his old Mount Zion Baptist Church.
   After Shenandoah, Forest made his debut at the Kennedy Center in
Washington in 1986, and later won a scholarship to London's
Guildhall School of Music and Drama. He sings in six languages and
has performed all over the world.
   ``He signed with the Metropolitan Opera in April of '89,'' said
the assemblies' founder, Don Anderson. ``He'd be pulling tobacco
today if he had not won that scholarship. He had no money to go to
school.''
   Forest said he'd been planning to take education classes at a
community college but had not applied when the scholarship came
along.
   His is not the only poignant tale of the music scholarships.
Once, a trombone virtuoso from coastal North Carolina traveled to
the competition and won, but lacked the bus fare home. Anderson
supplied the $15.
   ``The talent out there is really amazing,'' Anderson said, ``but
it's going to waste.''

<HEAD>Shakespeare Teachers Get Refresher Course in Teaching the Bard</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England (AP) _ On a hazy afternoon in the
Bard's birthplace of Stratford, Shakespeare was making particular
sense for a room of American and British teachers.
   Royal Shakespeare Company actor Ralph Fiennes was reciting
Sonnet 129 _ ``Th'expense of spirit in a waste of shame.'' He
stopped after each word and the teachers shouted, ``What?''
   The exercise compelled Fiennes to pay heed to every part of the
verse, and his audience was impressed.
   ``The idea of acting each word _ I can make my students do
that,'' said Lynn Lawrence, chairman of the English and drama
department at Osbourn Park High School in Manassas, Va.
   ``I've got tears in my eyes,'' sighed Marcia Rosenboom, who
teaches high school drama and English at George Community High
School in George, Iowa.
   Fiennes and vocal coach Andrew Wade were showing how
Shakespeare's Elizabethan language emerges clearly through
breathing and technical exercises which the teachers can apply at
home.
   The teachers were recently in Stratford on the first phase of a
program _ ``Teaching Shakespeare: Texts and Performances'' _ which
continued in Washington, D.C. at the Folger Shakespeare Library.
   The $500,000 program is the brainchild of the education
departments of the Folger and the RSC.
   ``This is the largest-scale Shakespeare-education-for-teachers
program that has ever gone on in the world,'' Tony Hill, the RSC's
director of education, said in a joint interview with his Folger
Library counterpart, Peggy O'Brien.
   There is a double aim: to immerse teachers in Shakespeare from
performing and analytical perspectives, and to give them the chance
to meet each other.
   ``Teachers can be the most insular, self-obsessed, and frankly
boring group of people you ever get in the world,'' said Hill, who
spent four years with O'Brien planning the current four weeks.
   ``At least part of that is to do with the fact that they're so
seldom given the tools to do their job that you'd give to any other
industry.''
   O'Brien, a former high school teacher, said teachers are too
often ``very invisible. One of the only ways we can see each other
is when we get in a group like this at an institute.''
   The 40 teachers on the program include 25 Americans and 15
Britons ranging in age from 24 to 60. They were chosen from more
than 500 applicants in the United States and 350 in Britain.
   Three scholars from American universities were on hand
throughout to lecture and offer tutorials, and there are as many
``master teachers'' to develop teaching strategies to take back to
the classroom.
   Of primary importance in Stratford is the opportunity to watch
classically trained talent such as Fiennes, who is playing Troilus
in ``Troilus and Cressida,'' grappling with difficult, knotted
verse.
   ``It's about making the punctuation mark a physical movement,''
Denise Fournier, a 29-year-old teacher from Concord, N.H., decided
after the young actor completed a drill in which grammar dictates
changes in gesture.
   For Lynn Lawrence, seeing the plays performed helps to teach
them: ``Students are leery. They're afraid of failure and of not
understanding (Shakespeare). I need to get them to see it as a
story and a performance, and there's no other way to get that.''
   The teachers attended Stratford productions of ``King Lear,''
``Troilus and Cressida,'' and ``The Comedy of Errors,'' as well as
``Edward II'' by Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare's contemporary.
   Their textual focus was on ``Lear,'' ``Troilus'' and ``Romeo and
Juliet'' _ the last chosen because, said Hill, ``it's something
everybody's going to have taught.''
   The site, for some, offers its own rewards.
   ``We (Americans) don't have any of this wonderful scenery or the
birthplace,'' said Karen Huffman, who teaches advanced placement
English to 12th-graders in Rapid City, S.D. ``It brings Shakespeare
home.''
   She added that the camaraderie was invaluable.
   ``I'm getting reassurance that I'm doing the right thing,''
Huffman said. ``I'm really pleased I'm keeping pace out there in
the boondocks.''
   Martha Christian, one of the ``master teachers,'' said:
``Teaching is lonely; most of us teach in isolation. This gives us
a network of people who are enthusiastic.''

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is no joke, it's the New York
governor's race.
   On the Democratic side, Gov. Mario Cuomo is seeking re-election
to a third, four-year term. If he wins, some think he might run for
president in 1992. He's campaigning by planting trees all across
the state.
   On the Republican side, Cuomo's challenger is economist Pierre
Rinfret. If he wins, he won't run for president. He can't. He was
born in Canada. You have to be born in the U.S.A. to be president.
   When Rinfret won the Republican state convention's nomination in
late May, he wasn't even a Republican. He said he thought he was.
He said he even remembered voting in Republican primaries. It
turned out he was listed in voting records as an independent. There
was no record of him having voted in any recent GOP primaries. He
subsequently enrolled as a Republican.
   That's not to say there weren't enrolled Republicans ready to
run. There were two of them. In fact, they are running. They just
aren't running as Republicans.
   Herbert London, a New York University dean, wanted the
Republican nomination but was rejected by GOP leaders. After
meeting Rinfret, London said he rejected an offer to become the
economist's running mate. London then accepted the Conservative
Party's nomination to run for governor. He's since spent much of
the campaign attacking Rinfret and the Republicans who rejected him.
   Louis Wein, a New York City-based consultant, went to the
Republican state convention intending to fight Rinfret for the
nomination. Rinfret is pro-choice on the abortion issue. Wein, who
is anti-abortion, was upset that the Republican platform included a
pro-choice plank.
   Wein said he finally agreed not to challenge Rinfret's
nomination after party leaders promised that the pro-choice plank
would be removed. Rinfret was nominated by acclamation but a
pro-choice plank, weaker than the original, stayed in.
   Wein then accepted the gubernatorial nomination of New York's
Right to Life Party.
   He also began circulating petitions in an attempt to force
Rinfret into a Sept. 11 primary for the GOP ballot spot. When he
didn't collect enough signatures, he went to court. He claims he
was the victim of fraud and double-cross at the state GOP
convention. Republican leaders say they only promised they would
discuss the pro-choice stand.
   Wein wants a state judge to order a Republican primary.
   ``Once they stop laughing at the courthouse,'' said Rinfret
campaign manager John Faso, ``I'm sure that it will be
unceremoniously dismissed.''
   ``I'd rather see Mario Cuomo governor than Mr. Rinfret,'' said
Wein at one point.
   The campaign has played largely like this: Rinfret attacks
Cuomo. Cuomo ignores Rinfret. London and Wein attack Rinfret.
   Rinfret provides some additional interest. He's never run for
office and his political inexperience often shows.
   Immediately after his nomination, Rinfret told reporters that he
wasn't a millionaire. A few minutes later he said his net worth was
more than $12 million. He explained the discrepancy by saying he
was ``teasing.'' He is a millionaire.
   In a later interview, Rinfret said he and his wife battled each
morning to see who would get to read The New York Times first. He
then said that he hated the Times, the state's most influential
newspaper, because ``it's biased, it's prejudiced and it lies.''
   He later told the Times he had been misunderstood. ``I was
fooling around, like a moron,'' he said.
   Rinfret, who runs an international economic consulting firm and
once served as an unpaid adviser to President Nixon, was discovered
by Republican leaders less than two weeks before the GOP
convention. A host of other prominent New York Republicans, such as
Rudolph Giuliani, Assembly Minority Leader Clarence Rappleyea and
Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari, had refused to run.
   Rinfret called such Republicans, ``gutless wonders.''
   A decorated World War II veteran, he also called Cuomo
``chicken'' for going to college instead of off to war in Korea.
   Cuomo, meanwhile, keeps mum on whether he'll run for president
and keeps planting trees. He's planted them on Long Island and in
Niagara Falls and at a host of stops in between. It's a device
meant to promote passage of a $2-billion environmental bond issue.
   The bond issue will be on the November ballot in New York state.
There is also an election for governor.

<HEAD>Major Oil Stocks Should Be a Safe Investment During Mideast Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the price of petroleum rising and crude
supplies falling, are oil company stocks a good bet during the
Mideast crisis?
   That depends.
   Most experts say shares of the major ``integrated'' oil
companies, such as Exxon, Mobil and Chevron, should be a safe
investment for the near term. In fact, many of these stocks are
considered undervalued.
   But some suggest it may be wise to avoid companies that are
primarily involved in refining crude, such as Diamond Shamrock R&amp;M.
These companies, it is argued, may be caught in the squeeze between
the steeper prices they must pay for crude and pressure they face
to hold down prices at the pump.
   While major oil companies may be in a good position, investing
in these stocks is not risk-free, analysts say.
   ``It's absolutely not the place to make a quick buck,'' said
Frank Knuettel, who follows oil companies at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   For one thing, oil companies face profit pressures as they
replace supplies gathered before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
with higher-price oil.
   In addition, the oil giants are under increasing pressure by
both the government and consumer groups to hold down gasoline
prices amid charges of price gouging.
   Finally, nobody knows whether the higher prices will cause a
steep dropoff in demand for gasoline and other refined products
that could crimp the bottom line.
   ``Higher prices and the potential for higher taxes will all work
on demand,'' said Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. analyst Stephen Smith.
   But the oil giants should be able to navigate around most of
these pitfalls, analysts say.
   Replacing crude supplies lost from Iraq and Kuwait should not be
a problem, said Barry Sahgal, an analyst at the New York brokerage
Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``They are so flexible that they can move from one crude source
to another,'' he said.
   In addition, analysts say the major oil companies will benefit
from the rise in crude prices even if they can't pass along all of
the costs to customers. Accounting practices allow them to book a
profit when their production subsidiaries sell the crude _ at the
newly higher prices _ to their refining units.
   Companies self-sufficient in crude production, such as Arco,
should particularly benefit, Smith said, while those that have to
purchase supplies on the world market will benefit less.
   Knuettel said he believes oil company profits will grow this
year even if rising prices crimp demand for gasoline and other
refined products. But he is less bullish about buying oil stocks
than some analysts.
   Knuettel advises investors holding stock in major integrated oil
companies to stand pat if the shares are considered a long-term
investment. But if the shares are held in a trading account,
investors should consider selling them to take a profit on days
when the stock prices are up, he said.
   ``The excitement of the moment has caused oil shares to reach
excessive prices near term,'' he wrote in a recent analysis.
   In fact, prices of many of the major oil company stocks hit
52-week highs in the days after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Since
then they have moderated somewhat.
   ``There was panic buying'' in the issues, said Sahgal, on the
belief that the stocks would benefit from the rise in oil prices
and offer an inflation hedge.
   Bear, Stearns said in a report last week that even if oil prices
average in the low $20 range for the rest of the year, energy
company stocks, including gas and coal concerns, are not trading at
prices that reflect their true value. The brokerage recommended
these stocks be ``purchased aggressively.''

<HEAD>Ratings War Brings Sex, Nudity to Brazilian Prime Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazilian television, which was
pretty steamy already, is filling prime time with nudity and
semi-explicit sex in a network ratings battle.
   Viewers have been favored with such wonders as an all-nude rock
band and a near-complete striptease.
   What many call the TV Sex War has inspired heated debate of
electronic eroticism and how much is too much.
   ``The pornographic use of nudity is indecent, but nudity in
itself is innocent,'' said Darcy Ribeiro, anthropologist and former
education minister. ``The ancient Greeks performed acts far more
indecent than anything seen on local TV.''
   It all started in April when Manchete TV, Brazil's third-largest
network, launched the prime-time soap opera ``Pantanal'' about a
wealthy ranching family in the vast Pantanal wetlands of central
Brazil.
   Manchete had an instant smash. For the first time, its ratings
surpassed those of Globo TV, the leading network and the world's
fourth-largest after ABC, CBS and NBC of the United States.
   ``Pantanal,'' broadcast six nights a week and scheduled to run
through December, has an excellent cast and features breathtaking
views of the wetlands.
   Was it the scenery that attracted huge audiences and started the
whole country talking? Not a chance. It was near-explicit love
scenes, the penchant of female stars for bathing in the river, the
total frontal nude of an underwater swimmer in the opening credits.
   As Manchete celebrated its success, Globo counterattacked with a
week of steamy, uncut movies running opposite the soap opera.
   Globo also unveiled, literally, popular star Claudia Raia during
a beach scene in its own prime-time soap opera ``Queen of the Junk
Yard,'' which runs just before ``Pantanal.''
   Other networks joined in.
   Silvio Santos, owner of SBT, the second-largest, broadcast a
series of literary adaptions as an alternative to the racy fare of
other channels, and said later: ``We had the worst audience ratings
in the nine years of SBT.''
   A University of Sao Paulo survey in late June counted 1,145
displays of nudity and 276 scenes of explicit or implict sex in one
week of television.
   Some viewers are outraged.
   ``We are not voyeurs, we are normal people,'' Ana Conceicao of
Rio wrote to a major newspaper. ``The scenes being shown are so raw
that explicit sex will soon be broadcast into our homes.''
   Romeu Trussardi Filho, head of the Commercial Association of Sao
Paulo, accused the networks of ``opportunism to generate higher
ratings and greater profit opportunities.''
   Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral has scheduled a meeting in
early September with station owners, writers, soap opera stars and
religious officials to discuss creation of a television code of
ethics.
   Most Brazilians seem to like the spice.
   A survey by the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo found 83 percent of
those questioned felt ``comfortable'' with the nude scenes in
``Pantanal,'' 13 percent were ``embarrassed when watching with
others'' and 4 percent were ``embarrassed when watching alone.''
   Most said they wanted as many or more nude scenes.
   ``The public likes the sex and nudity,'' said Marta Suplicy, a
psychoanalyst and author of several books on sex and culture.
``Most people have boring lives and enjoy watching others have a
good time.''
   Brazilians are used to exposed bodies, in minuscule ``tanga''
bikinis on the beaches or at the wild Carnival holiday before Lent,
but eroticism on television was limited until a new constitution
abolished all censorship in 1988.
   Coverage of Carnival heated up immediately and the Justice
Ministry asked networks to exercise restraint in live broadcasts of
semi-nude samba dancers at private clubs.
   Rosemarie Muraro, a prominent writer and feminist, said
television merely reflects the way most Brazilians view sex and
sexuality.
   ``People here are much more comfortable with their bodies than
in Anglo-Saxon countries,'' she said. ``No one even notices the
skimpy bikinis on Copacabana beach.''
   She advocated more male nudity. Most of the bare scenes on
television feature women.
   Ms. Muraro said her one concern about sex on television was that
it might increase the rate of teen pregnancy.
   Mrs. Suplicy, the psychoanalyst, said gratuitous sex scenes
``reaffirm a macho culture and sexist stereotypes,'' and could harm
younger viewers.
   ``No country in the world exposes its children to the same level
of eroticism'' on television as Brazil, she said. ``Seven-year-old
girls think about nothing but romance and seducing boys.''
   The ratings battle, like the debate, rages on.
   In late July, Globo presented ``Skid Row,'' a mystery with the
fully exposed form of actress-model Silvia Pfeifer as its main
attraction.
   Manchete struck back with ``The Song of the Mermaids,'' a
near-plotless revelation of the bare breasts of three other
actress-models.
   Critics panned ``Mermaids,'' including one who said: ``If the
show is any guide, Homer's Ulysses did not plug the ears of his
brave sailors to protect them from the mermaids' enchanting song.
It was to spare them from the stupidities they spouted.''
   The public felt otherwise. ``Mermaids'' crushed ``Skid Row'' in
viewer polls.

   The cost of living rose 0.4 percent in July,
the government said in a report showing persistent inflation even
before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices soaring.
   The advance Thursday in the Labor Department's Consumer Price
Index was slightly higher than most economists had expected. It
came despite a 0.7 percent decline in energy costs, sure to be more
than reversed when August prices are reported next month.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices jumped a
worrisome 0.6 percent. Analysts view this so-called ``core'' rate
as a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures.

Analysts forecast little, if any, improvement for the remainder of

   The Commerce Department said Thursday that starts of new homes
and apartments fell for the sixth straight month, down 2.6 percent
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.15 million units.
   That was the lowest level since builders began 1.14 million

   Many executives are trying to keep a stiff upper
lip when it comes to how the recent spike in oil prices will affect
corporate profits in the final months of 1990.
   But analysts say there's virtually no industry that will escape
unscathed, even if the Middle East crisis is resolved soon, and it
appears increasingly less likely that the final quarter will
salvage a year of relatively lackluster returns.
   ``Everybody is going to be hurt by this,'' said Robert Brusca,
chief economist at Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. ``I
wouldn't think this is the kind of thing you can diversify
against.''
   The jump in oil prices is seen as raising costs of production,
materials and shipping for everyone from farmers to industrialists.
Statistics indicate the economy already was in a slowdown before
the oil shock, and the outlook now might include a full-fledged
recession.
   Still, many companies are maintaining their outward composure.
They say that although they're monitoring the situation, it's still
pretty much business as usual.
   ``We're concerned about the macro question of peace in our time,
but I don't know if (the Gulf crisis) will have a bearing on the
(fourth) quarter,'' said Barbara Lucas, a vice president of
Towsend, Md.-based Black &amp; Decker Corp.
   Union Carbide Corp. has seen ``no major effect on our operating
or production costs'' and has made no major changes in its
strategic plans, spokesman Thomas Sprick said from company
headquarters in Danbury, Conn.
   Both he and Lucas suggested their companies may be somewhat
insulated from higher prices because they have long-term contracts
for raw materials.
   But contracts do get renegotiated, or even broken. ``The legal
fees associated with breaking a contract might be cheaper than
supplying somebody with cheap energy,'' said John Silvia, an
economist and vice president at Kemper Financial Services in
Chicago.
   Silvia has revised his profit projections in light of the oil
crisis. He's predicting corporate profits will total $306 billion
in the quarter ending Sept. 30, down from an earlier estimate of
around $320 billion. And for the final quarter of the year, he
expects profits to show an 18 percent decline from the year-ago
period.
   ``There will be different degrees of impact, but I don't think
anybody is going to walk away from it and say they're not
affected,'' Silvia said.
   Companies taking the hit initially are airlines, transportation
companies and consumer durables manufacturers, but that will filter
down to most other industries over time, he said.
   ``The most serious overall issue has to be consumer
confidence,'' Silvia said. Given the weakness in demand,
manufacturers may have a hard time passing on price increases to
compensate for their higher costs.
   ``The (Middle East) crisis adds another layer to the problems
firms are facing,'' Nikko's Brusca said. ``They're cutting back
capital spending . . . Inventories have been cut down and order
backlogs have been falling for some time,'' all indications that
corporate projections are less than optimistic.
   Many observers were hoping the final quarter would provide
businesses with a shot in the arm, similar to the last three months
of 1989, when after-tax profits rose 2.8 percent after falling in
each of the previous three quarters. Retailers in particular are
especially vulnerable in the final quarter, when they typically
rack up most of their earnings during the holiday shopping period.
   This year, things started modestly. The Commerce Department said
after-tax profits rose 1.1 percent in the first quarter. Results
for the second quarter are scheduled to be released Aug. 24.
   But executives are not interested in looking backwards.
   ``If we have an interruption of supply, higher oil prices and a
reallocation of resources . . . it would be difficult to see how we
would escape that,'' said Leonard Hadley, executive vice president
and chief operating officer of Maytag Corp., based in Newton, Iowa.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gold cordoba, Nicaragua's new
money, has stumbled out of the starting gate despite an aggressive
campaign by the government to bolster confidence in the currency.
   Nicaraguans seem wary of the gold cordoba, which went into
circulation on Monday, and with the old cordobas still circulating,
confusion mingles with the uncertainty.
   The old cordoba was devalued Thursday, the 31st time since
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took office April 25, trading
at 750,000 to the dollar from the previous rate of 690,000. It was
bringing up to 800,000 to the dollar on Managua's flourishing and
illegal black market.
   Francisco Mayorga, the head of Nicaragua's Central Bank, said
the gold cordobas will be backed by dollars and will be exchanged
on par with the dollar.
   Mayorga said tying the new currency to the dollar is intended to
end the string of devaluations and bring some stability to the
economy.
   The government said the devaluations of the old cordoba will
continue until it is entirely replaced by the new money, possibly
by the end of the year.
   On Monday, 4.5 million of the new cordobas went into
circulation, representing about 10 percent of the value of the
money in the country.
   State workers received up to 50 gold cordobas as a part of their
salaries, and got the rest in old cordobas.
   But the lowest gold cordoba denomination is 5 cordobas, equal to
five dollars, a large sum in one of the hemisphere's poorest
countries.
   Bills of one gold cordoba and less are to begin circulating in
October, but for now Nicaraguans spending gold cordobas have to
take change in the old money at the official rate.
   Thousands of government employees, meanwhile, headed to black
market moneychangers to try to swap the new money for dollars in
case the new money became devalued, but the black marketeers, known
locally as ``coyotes,'' weren't interested.
   ``The gold cordoba cannot be on par with the dollar,'' said one.
``The dollar is the world currency and even in underdeveloped
countries with stable economies the money is not on par with the
dollar.''
   The Central Bank also refused to change the new cordobas for
dollars, saying such a run would deplete its supply.
   Nicaragua is swimming in virtually worthless cordobas. In their
last year in office the leftist Sandinista government stopped
devaluing them, leaving the currency extremely overvalued.
   Mrs. Chamorro's government began a series of devaluations that
sent prices for basics soaring, leading to two damaging general
strikes, mostly by Sandinista-led unions.

   An increase in the world supply of crude oil
will not necessarily translate into plenty of gasoline for the
United States, according to oil industry sources who warned that
higher prices might persist.
   Even though oil-producing nations could probably boost their
output by up to 3.5 million barrels per day, making up for most of
the 4 million barrels kept off the market by the boycott of Iraq
and Kuwait, there could be problems in getting the crude refined to
meet U.S. standards, the sources said.
   Additional production might be the wrong kind of crude, or it
could come from Libya and Iran, which the United States will not do
business with, several executives of a major oil company told
reporters in a meeting Thursday.
   The executives, who spoke on condition that neither they nor
their company be identified, said refineries that could increase
output in several foreign countries are also unable to make oil
products that meet stringent U.S. environmental standards, such as
unleaded gasoline.
   ``There are certain crudes and certain products and certain
suppliers you can't turn to,'' one of the executives said.
   ``The stuff that's idle today does not serve the purposes of the
U.S.,'' said another executive.
   A spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's
main trade group, said refineries generally are geared to take a
certain type of oil and they try to get that oil. ``There's great
variation,'' among crudes and refineries, he said.
   World oil markets have been in a state of chaos, with prices
steadily on the rise, after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug.
2 and an international boycott of the oil from both nations was put
in place.
   The oil executives said three modern, sophisticated refineries
in Kuwait have been knocked out of the world market because of the
boycott. Those refineries had a capacity of about 600,000 barrels
of refined oil per day, some of which was arriving in the southern
United States through the Gulf of Mexico, the executives said.
   The executives predicted that OPEC nations will not immediately
increase production to make up for the Iraq-Kuwait shortfall until
they allow time for oil inventories to drop.
   Crude oil futures traded higher Thursday as investors remained
uncertain about what might happen in the Middle East. On the New
York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for West Texas
Intermediate, rose 90 cents to $27.36 a barrel.
   Retail gasoline prices shot up after the invasion and remain
well above their levels of a month ago. Unleaded, self-service
gasoline averaged $1.216 a gallon nationally on Monday, compared
with $1.075 a gallon on Aug. 1, according to a spot check of 1,400
service stations by the American Automobile Association.
   One of the oil executives called the current situation ``a
long-term problem.'' He predicted the price of crude would stay
high, as will the price of gasoline in coming months.
   Dozens of U.S. refineries have closed in recent years when oil
prices declined. It would take a continued higher margin of profit
on gasoline prices before oil companies build new refineries or
increase the capacity of existing refineries, he said.

   Two oil companies that had frozen wholesale fuel
prices as consumers cried foul over steep increases at the pump
lifted the moratoriums citing competitive pressure.
   Spokesmen for the Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. declined to say
whether the one-week price freezes caused losses. Amoco and Unocal
said they would monitor prices daily and that increases were
possible.
   President Bush, in a televised address, last week called on the
nation's oil companies to hold down pump prices and not take
advantage of market jitters and rising crude oil prices following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Amoco and Unocal were among several big oil companies to freeze
or lower wholesale prices. The reductions did not directly affect
prices at retail gas stations, which by federal law set their own
prices.
   ``There remains a lot of upward pressure,'' Amoco spokesman
Michael Thompson said Thursday. ``We'll be watching the marketplace
in the days to come and we'll see what happens.''
   Amoco had frozen prices on gasoline, jet fuel and distillates.
Thompson said the company, based in Chicago, did not change prices
Thursday it charges wholesalers.
   Unocal, based in Los Angeles, had frozen only wholesale gasoline
prices. It was to lift the freeze at 3 a.m. EDT today.
   ``It's a daily review and hourly review depending on how the
market moves,'' Unocal spokesman Jim Bray said. ``We made a
marketing decision. Several of the other majors have gone up
recently.''
   On Wednesday, Atlantic Richfield Co. extended a freeze on
gasoline, jet and diesel fuel prices, but said it would review it
on a daily basis.
   Arco, which sells gasoline at 1,500 stations in five Western
states, was the first oil company to announce a freeze after pump
prices increased sharply following Iraq's invasion.
   But there was no indication that the freezes were anything more
than cosmetic, as crude oil prices have risen only slightly in the
interim. On Thursday, crude oil gained 90 cents to $27.36 per
42-gallon barrel, compared with about $26 a barrel a week earlier.
   Retail gasoline prices shot up 16 cents a gallon on average
after the invasion, but apparently have stabilized at the higher
levels. Unleaded, self-service gasoline averaged $1.216 a gallon
nationally on Monday, compared with $1.075 a gallon on Aug. 1,
according to a spot check by the American Automobile Association.
   Phillips Petroleum Co., which cut its wholesale gasoline price
by 4.5 cents a gallon on Aug. 8, said Thursday it has increased the
price by 1.8 cents since then.
   British Petroleum Co.'s U.S. unit, which last Friday said it
would hold its pump prices steady and later lowered them by about 3
cents a gallon in most markets, said its prices were about the same.

   While soldiers stand guard in the deserts
of Saudi Arabia, some Oklahomans are busy at sewing machines and
cutting tables to prepare equipment that may be needed on the front
lines.
   Sac and Fox Industries has a $30 million contract with the
Department of Defense to produce nearly 500,000 chemical warfare
suits, protective garments that would be needed if Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein uses his stockpiles of poison gas.
   The company owned by the Sac and Fox Indian tribe is planning to
almost double its work force and reopen a clothing factory in
Temple. Some say that may help some Oklahoma towns bounce back from
recent pullouts and cutbacks by major employers.
   Sac and Fox employs 550 people at plants in Commerce, Cushing
and Idabel. The increase in production, including eventual
operations at Temple, could raise the employee total to more than
1,000, said Sac and Fox Industries president James Brannum.
   He said the increase is dependent on the company getting more of
the type of fabric it uses, which he said is in big demand.
   For now, 19 workers from Temple, the southwestern Oklahoma town
where Haggar Clothing shut down a factory in February, are
commuting 220 miles to Idabel, in the state's southeastern corner,
where they stay during the week at a hotel the company has leased,
said office manager Mary Chambers.
   ``They're patriotic,'' Brannum said. ``They're not just doing it
for the town or Oklahoma. They're wanting to do what is right for
the country in a time of crisis.''
   People are also eager for work. In addition to the Haggar
shutdown in Temple, Idabel has been hit by Defense Department cuts
at the Red River Army Depot in northeast Texas.
   While it is possible that Sac and Fox won't be able to hire all
of the 270 workers laid off when Haggar left, Temple Mayor Jack
Kindred said any opportunities are encouraging.
   Sac and Fox Industries has already signed a lease on the former
Haggar plant, Kindred said.
   The community's economy sagged when Haggar left, Kindred said.
   ``We had about five little towns that we drew into Temple,'' he
said.
   ``You used to drive through downtown and both sides of the
street would be lined with cars,'' said Glen Good, manager of
Warehouse Discount Food. ``We've got a dress shop that's barely
hanging on. Even our (car license) tag agent is hurting.
   ``If Sac and Fox can put nearly as many people back to work than
were here before, that's good.''
   In Idabel, the impact may not be as noticeable. The McCurtain
County seat was projected to grow even before the Sac and Fox
expansion, said Bruce Willingham, a Sac and Fox Industries director.
   ``There's been a gradual increase in employment,'' Willingham
said.
   ``The situation in the Middle East has brought home (to the
workers) how pivotal their jobs are.''
   He said it takes between 30 to 60 days to complete a suit, with
a good piece of that time spent on detailed inspection process.
About 10,000 suits are near completion and 60,000 total are under
way. On Tuesday, 3,200 suits were shipped, plant officials said.
   Ms. Chambers said when the current contract is complete, the
government has the option to order additional suits. The
2,500-member tribe expects there will be a market for the suits for
some time, she said.

<HEAD>Image Consultant Says Businesses Can Use Color to Compete</HEAD>

   Clothing, colors and table manners can make or
break business executives, image consultants said here at their
annual trade show.
   ``We have been programmed by television to deliver a message in
30 seconds,'' said Marily Mondejar, founder and executive director
of Image Industry Council International, a trade organization for
consultants who teach businesses how to polish their images.
   ``In the first five seconds of meeting a person, that person
will make a decision about you ... based on maybe the colors you're
wearing, your jewelry, your hair, how you're moving. That is what
image is all about,'' she said Thursday at the San Francisco-based
group's third annual meeting.
   ``Image ... is about bringing the best in you ... so that people
will listen to what you have to say,'' Ms. Mondejar said.
   Wearing appropriate-colored clothing is one way executives can
create an image to achieve their goals, she told about two dozen
executives at a seminar titled ``Corporate Savvy.''
   For example, darker colors convey a sense of authority, while
lighter ones indicate friendliness. A businessman seeking to
consummate a deal might want to convey both traits by wearing a
dark suit with a light-colored necktie, she said.
   Table manners also can be a winning tool for executives,
according to Ms. Mondejar, who said 70 percent of all business
deals ``are closed during a meal.''
   To project a polished, professional image, executives should
know the proper way to butter their bread, said M.J. Cross, an
image consultant from Munster, Ind.
   ``To butter a bread roll, take a bite-sized pinch, butter that
bite, and put it in your mouth,'' rather than chomping into a large
piece of buttered bread, she advised as the executives prepared to
launch into a five-course demonstration meal at a posh downtown
restaurant.
   ``Otherwise you have a great tendency to leave a buttery
moustache,'' if you happen to have facial hair, Ms. Cross said.
   Color analysis is another way to assess people's personalities
and help businesses succeed, Ms. Mondejar said.
   The theory groups people into categories based on the four
seasons, depending on the color of their eyes, hair and complexion.
An emerging branch of color analysis attaches personality traits to
each season, Ms. Mondejar said in an interview during the
conference.
   For example, dark-featured people are ``winters'' while those
with lighter eyes and complexions are ``summers,'' she said.
   ``Winters'' tend to be bossy and power-hungry, while ``summers''
are more compromising and harmonious, Ms. Mondejar said.
   Executives can use the theory to assess their competitors and
also determine what clothing colors can help them project the most
complimentary, professional image, she said.
   Joan C. LeValley, president of a suburban Chicago accounting
firm, was among the 150 or so executives who sought
business-boosting tips at the four-day conference.
   Ms. LeValley said she has used a color consultant to improve her
own appearance, and has decorated her office in earth tones to
project a warm, comfortable image for clients.
   ``Business are learning that if we don't project ourselves in
the professional status we are, we're going to fail, because
somebody else is'' going to do it better, said Ms. LeValley.

<HEAD>Exxon Hopes To Whittle Down Multibillion-Dollar IRS Tax Claim</HEAD>

   Exxon Corp. is fighting a $6.5 billion tax claim
brought by the IRS and the oil giant predicted it will chip away
most of the government's case before going to trial next year.
   ``This case, when it gets to court, is not going to be a $6.5
billion case,'' Exxon tax lawyer William D. O'Brien said Thursday
after filing a petition against the Internal Revenue Service in
U.S. Tax Court in Washington.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl called the attempt by the
government to collect almost three times the $2.5 billion that
Exxon has already paid in federal income tax for 1980-82 ``totally
unwarranted.''
   After Exxon announced its filing late Thursday, an IRS spokesman
in Washington said no tax officials were immediately available to
discuss the government's position in the decade-old dispute.
   According to Exxon, the government's tax claim hinges on
allegations that the oil giant avoided taxes by charging too little
for oil it purchased from Saudi Arabia.
   ``The IRS completely ignores that Saudi Arabia's policy of price
moderation in the late 1970s and early 1980s required Exxon to buy
and sell Saudi crude oil at the same prices established by the
Saudi Arabian government,'' O'Brien said. At the time, Saudi Arabia
was trying to keep the price of oil under control by selling crude
cheaply in the wake of the Iranian revolution.
   At the time, the U.S. government was also encouraging moderation
in oil prices, O'Brien said. Exxon finds it ironic that the
government now has flip-flopped during the latest oil crisis and
started saying Exxon should have charged more for its oil 10 years
ago, O'Brien said.
   Since Exxon's income tax filing is so complicated, the company
had waived the normal statute of limitations to give the IRS plenty
of time to complete its audits. Earlier this year, Exxon demanded
that the IRS move ahead on the matter, giving the tax collectors
little choice but to file a claim against the company, O'Brien said.
   Exxon decided to force the IRS' hand because lawyers did not
want to wait on the outcome of a similar fight between the
government and Texaco, he said.
   The government's contention that Exxon did not charge enough for
its oil, much of which was distributed to the company's overseas
subsidiaries, involves $1.5 billion of the IRS claim. O'Brien
described the other elements of the dispute as ``plain-vanilla-type
items that ordinarily are in an oil company's tax return.''
   They include such items as deductions for drilling costs, he
said.
   Since Exxon pushed the government into making its claim, the IRS
employed a shotgun approach because it did not have time to
thoroughly explore each item. O'Brien predicted that negotiations
between the two sides will result in many of the IRS' contentions
being dropped.
   Should Exxon end up paying more taxes, the company has enough
reserves on hand to avoid any effect on earnings, O'Brien said. He
expects the case to go to trial before Tax Court Judge Meade
Whitaker sometime in 1991.

<HEAD>Ameritrust to Cut 780 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Ameritrust Corp. plans to cut about 11
percent of its staff as part of a plan to reduce costs by $60
million by the end of 1992.
   About 40 percent of the 780 positions are being cut through
attrition, said Howard Glassroth, Ameritrust's vice president for
corporate affairs.
   The action is a response to the changing marketplace and the
economy, Glassroth said Thursday.
   ``This is fairly typical of what's going on in the banking
industry right now,'' he said.
   Ameritrust reported losses of $33.2 million for the first half
of this year.
   Jerry Jarrett, Ameritrust's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the bank will provide ``comprehensive severance
options and career transition programs'' for employees who are
losing their jobs.
   Glassroth said he didn't know who would lose jobs or when the
cuts would occur. The company employs about 6,800 people nationwide.
   The program is expected to last 12 to 16 months, but many of the
cuts will occur this year.
   Bank employees will start learning Monday whether they will stay
or go.
   Ameritrust said the cost-cutting program would not change its
plans to move into new headquarters in 1993 nor does the company
plan to close any bank branches.
   The company lost $51.6 million in the first quarter of this year
after a regulatory exam led to a special $120 million addition to
its reserve against possible loan losses.
   Daniel Martin, analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., criticized
Ameritrust for not being careful enough in the standards it used to
evaluate highly leveraged transactions.
   ``Growth has taken place apparently without the attention to
underwriting standards that should have been in place to avoid
affecting asset quality down the road,'' he said.
   He said the rating on some Ameritrust bonds had slipped in
recent years largely because of increased riskiness in its loan
portfolio.
   Martin and other analysts praised the decision to cut costs,
saying it reflects increased competitive pressures in the banking
industry.
   ``I think it's tough for the people who are losing jobs, but I
think it's a positive move for the company,'' said Tom Brown, an
analyst with Paine Webber. He said many banks have begun trimming
personnel, branch and administrative expenses to make up for
sluggish loan growth caused by a slowing economy.

   Resorts International moved closer to
emerging from bankruptcy proceedings early today when a judge
approved a restructuring plan that would allow entertainer Merv
Griffin's casino company to shed some of its massive debt.
   Shortly after midnight, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary
Gambardella approved a plan to give bondholders 78 percent of the
company, dropping Griffin's stake to 21.5 percent, said Resorts
attorney Stephen Kaplan.
   The plan was filed in December under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code and amended in April to include the proposed sale
of Resorts' Paradise Island operations in the Bahamas.
   Resorts would exchange the $911 million in debt held by
bondholders for new notes totaling $434 million, eliminating more
than half of the casino company's debt.
   The plan had been overwhelmingly approved by bondholders but
must still be approved by the state Casino Control Commission and
the Bahamian government.
   Last week, the commission approved Resorts' preliminary draft
documents concerning ownership restructuring, the transfer of
securities, the shift of Resorts to a publicly traded company and
Resorts president David Hanlon's employment contract.
   The panel, which declined to rule on the plan until Ms.
Gambardella released her decision, is scheduled to consider the
matter today.
   The commission also will consider part of the plan that sets
aside a $5 million legal kitty to allow Resorts bondholders to sue
Donald Trump, Resorts' former owner. Bondholders claim Trump left
the company insolvent in a 1988 swap with Griffin in which Trump
got the unfinished Taj Mahal Casino Resort next door.
   Trump has said Griffin is responsible for weighing the company
down with too much debt.

   Stock prices fell steeply in early, heavy
trading today, echoing losses overseas amid continued concern about
the Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 41.58 points
to 2,639.85 in the first half hour of trading.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by more than 6 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 145
up, 937 down and 331 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled a strong 34.83
million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   The market received a bit of good economic news this morning,
but it appeared to be overshawdowed by Thursday's bad report on
inflation and Mideast concern.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit dropped
to seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June. But analysts expect it
to resume rising once the impact of increasing imported oil prices
takes effect.
   On Thursday, the government reported that inflation rose at an
unexpectedly high rate last month. Concern was increased because
the data was measured before the start of the Mideast tension.
   In Japan, share prices plunged on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the key index closed 2.77 percent lower. Traders said many
investors were disappointed that Thursday's meeting between
President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein failed to produce any
breakthrough in the Iraqi stalemate.
   Stock prices also were sharply lower in midday European trading.
   Disappointment over the Iraqi situation, as well as inflationary
concerns, were blamed for Thursday's sharp price drop on Wall
Street. The Dow Jones average fell 66.83 points to 2,681.44.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks in early trading today,
American Express fell &rsqb; to 25, Boeing dropped 1{ to 49&lsqb;, General
Electric was down 1 to 63~ and Philip Morris lost &rsqb; to 44~.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares fell
2.37 to 180.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 335.33, down 1.50.
   On Thursday, volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 138.85
million shares, up from 135.21 million shares in Wednesday's
session.
   The NYSE's composite index fell 3.81 to 182.73. At the American
Stock Exchange, the market value index lost 3.81 to 336.83.

   Robert Fildes has resigned as
president and chief executive officer of biotechnology company
Cetus Corp.
   The company said Thursday in announcing the resignation that it
also plans to cut its workforce of 950 people by about 100 to
``lower its current operating expenses.''
   The moves come two weeks after a Food and Drug Administration
panel rebuffed the company's request for approval of its
anti-cancer drug interleukin-2, and asked for more data.
   Fildes, who also stepped down as a director of the company,
resigned because of ``differing views regarding the company's
priorities,'' according to a Cetus news release.
   Asked what those priorities involved, company spokeswoman Jana
Cuiper said she ``could not comment further than what was in the
release.''
   She said it has not yet been determined who will be involved in
the layoffs. ``We should know by Sept. 15,'' she said.
   Fildes will provide ``continuing services to Cetus as a
consultant,'' the company said.
   Company founder Ronald Cape has been named chief executive and
Hollings Renton, the chief operating officer, was elected president.
   ``In the past, we have sought strategic relationships which
contributed to our objectives, and we now intend to pursue more
aggressively alliances which will help us build our business and
lower our risk,'' said Cape.
   Cape had relinquished the chief executive's job to Fildes in
1986 and continued as chairman.
   Founded in 1971, the company develops, manufactures and markets
therapeutic products targeted at cancers and serious infectious
diseases.

<HEAD>Oil Prices and Mideast News Supplant Government Reports as Bond
Market Movers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Once the bond market brushes the desert sand
from a pile of government reports that show a weakening economy,
fixed-income securities could be poised for a rally.
   The government reports of economic output, leading indicators
and unemployment traditionally dominate the market's activity.
   But since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait and American forces were
dispatched to Saudi Arabia, news on the Persian Gulf crisis has
been holding traders' attention.
   ``Really the Street is preoccupied with Mideast news rather than
any government reports,'' said James Marshall, a government
securities trader at Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   Rather than climbing on the signs of a weakening economy, the
market has been swayed in its daily ups and downs by the latest
pronouncements from Baghdad or Washington.
   Most of the movement has been down. The yield of the Treasury's
30-year benchmark bond, which rises when the bond price falls, has
climbed from 8.45 percent shortly before Iraq invaded Kuwait to
flirting with 9 percent late last week.
   ``What we've been saying in general is the economic statistics
will take a back seat in general to whatever is going on in the
Middle East,'' said Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Ramirez
Capital Consultants in New York.
   Investors are looking for signals of whether the Persian Gulf
crisis is headed for a resolution and how oil prices could be
affected. Ultimately they're trying to get an idea of what is going
to happen to inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income
securities.
   Investors concerned about inflation have shied away from
committing themselves.
   Thursday's report that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent
in July was slightly more than what economists had expected and
made many doubtful the Fed would try to lower interest rates before
the Persian Gulf crisis settles down or there is more evidence the
economy is sagging.
   Many are confident the Fed will have to lower interest rates to
stimulate growth eventually. The government also reported Thursday
that that housing starts had fallen for the sixth straight month in
July to their lowest level since the last recession.
   Once bad news on the crisis slows or oil prices come down,
investors are likely to rediscover the economy's weakness, said
Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Economists say several reports from the government show the
economy is in trouble.
   July's unemployement rate reached its highest mark in nearly two
years at 5.5 percent. Housing starts fell 2.6 percent in July. The
gross national product showed a modest 1.2 percent increase in the
second quarter. Economists point to a drop in total sales combined
with a buildup in inventories as signaling an economic downturn.
   The Federal Reserve's own ``beige book,'' a survey of the 12 Fed
districts, reported the pace of economic growth was slowing.
   ``If we get back to normal over there and oil prices show some
weakening, the market will be in real good shape,'' Marshall said.
   More statistics highlighting the economy's ill health could also
spark more interest in the bond market.
   The government is scheduled to report its revised second-quarter
gross national product figure Friday, with economists expecting the
economy to have grown a sluggish 1 percent. July's durable goods
orders are expected to have increased 0.5 percent in Thursday's
report.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Drops Sharply _ For Now</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts Mosbacher and midmorning stock market reaction,
picking up 7th graf, The deficit . . . Also moving on general news
wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit dropped to a seven-year
low of $5.07 billion in June, the government said today, but
analysts expect it to resume acceleration once the impact of the
Middle East crisis takes effect on the price of oil imports.
   The Commerce Department said the June deficit was down 34.7
percent from the $7.77 billion imbalance posted in May. It was the
lowest deficit since $3.96 billion in June 1983.
   Until recently, many economists and government officials,
including Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, were predicting that
strong export growth would offset a growing dependence on foreign
oil and result in the first U.S. deficit below $100 billion since
1983.
   In fact, the deficit for the first half of 1990 had been running
at an annual rate of $91.62 billion.
   Mosbacher welcomed today's news, saying that while
month-to-month figures can be erratic, ``the strong, positive trend
indicates increasing U.S. export competitiveness in the world
marketplace.''
   But some analysts question the effect of the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait and the subsequent rise in oil prices on later trade reports
this month. Some say deficits could grow even larger once the
higher oil prices are added to the import bill starting in August.
   The stock market largely ignored the news and appeared to be
concentrating on Thursday's report on inflation and the Mideast
itself. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 33.42
points to 2648.02 by late morning.
   The deficit improvement in June came from a 2.9 percent decrease
in imports to $39.37 billion, and a 4.6 percent gain in exports to
a record $34.3 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between
imports and exports.
   A Commerce spokesman said $500 million in airplane shipments
contributed to the record exports.
   It was the first time this year the deficit had dropped below $7
billion. It averaged $7.64 billion a month so far in 1990, compared
to $9.12 billion in 1989.
   But higher oil import costs now threaten to add even more than
expected to the U.S. import bill. At the same time, overseas
economies have slowed, lessening demand there for U.S. goods.
   ``So you have a combination of slower export growth and a higher
oil import bill,'' explained Mark M. Zandi, an economist with
Regional Financial Associates in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   ``Those two things are going to serve to limit any possibility
of a significant improvement in the merchandise trade deficit over
the next six months to a year,'' he said.
   Oil imports in June fell 14.6 percent to $3.69 billion.
Americans imported 8.40 million barrels a day, down from 8.95
billion in May. The average price per barrel fell to $14.64, down
from $15.57.
   However, in an ominous portent for trade reports this fall,
prices of the benchmark West Texas crude had risen to $27.36 by
Thursday.
   In addition to aircraft, other capital goods, foods, and
consumer goods added to the export total.
   On the import side, there were declines in industrial supplies,
consumer goods and automobiles.
   As usual, the biggest deficit was with Japan, a $3.1 billion
imbalance, up from a $3.0 billion deficit in May.
   The United States posted a surplus with western Europe of $899
million.
   Other deficits included Taiwan, $900 million; China, $800
million; Canada, $700 million; Brazil, $300 million; Korea, $200
million, and Hong Kong, $100 million.
   The deficit peaked at $152.12 billion in 1987 and then dropped
to $118.53 billion the following year. The 1989 deficit slid
further to $109 billion.
   A further improvement this year would have been good news for
the Bush administration, which had counted on a strong trade
performance to help keep the economy out of a recession and help
reduce the federal budget deficit.
   Over the past three years, fully one-third of overall U.S.
economic growth has been supplied by surging export sales. That has
become even more important recently as consumer spending has faded
in the face of adverse economic news.
   Zandi noted that, until the Middle East developments, the United
States' foreign oil bill totaled about $100 billion a year. Prices
have soared since the invasion.
   ``So if it remains at current levels, it could add between $10
billion and $15 billion over the coming year to our oil import
bill,'' he said.
   At the same time, evidence points to weaker exports because of
slower economic growth particularly in Japan and the Pacific Rim
nations, and to a lesser extent in Western Europe, Zandi said.
   ``Our forecast is for real export growth to slow to about 5
percent over the next year'' from about 17 percent now, he said.
   Zandi also had a scenario that would dramatically improve the
deficit, but one which few want to see.
   ``If the economy slides into a significant recession, where we
see consumers and businesses retrenching, that would cause the
deficit to improve soley because imports would collapse,'' he
explained.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as
concern about slack export demand replaced talk of possible frost
in the northern Corn Belt.
   Few traders took Thursday's frost forecast by one private
meteorologist seriously, said Joel Karlin, a grain analyst with
Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   ``That's absurd,'' he said of the prediction for freezing
temperatures Monday night. ``As a matter of fact, we're probably
going to have a warmer weekend this weekend than we've had for a
while.''
   Karlin attributed further selling to expectations that export
demand for U.S. feed grains is likely to remain weak _ especially
if the Persian Gulf conflict tips the world's major economies into
recession.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2{ cents to 3 cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.81} a bushel;
corn was } cent lower to \ cent higher with September at $2.49 a
bushel; December oats were down 2\ cents with the untraded
September contract bid at $1.15} a bushel, 2\ cents below
Thursday's settlement; soybeans were 9{ cents lower to 3 cents

   Livestock futures were mostly lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange; pork bellies were mixed.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent to .40 cent lower with August
at 78.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .60 cent
lower with August at 89.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .25 cent
lower to .08 cent higher with August at 57.65 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .30 cent lower to .68 cent higher with August at

<BYLINE>Dog Day Christmas: Sleighs Amid Summer Vacationers at Year-Round
Stores</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EXETER, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are 12 days of Christmas, but 12
months of shopping for it.
   On a recent summer morning, the sleighs outside the Christmas
House here looked misplaced on a lush lawn, but inside, cheerily
making their way among the nutcrackers and garlands, were plenty of
customers.
   ``I come in here and I just think, `Oh, it's time to start
buying,' '' Marcia Mulholland, 50, said over the strains of
Christmas tunes.
   Mulholland isn't alone. Christmas enthusiasts spread enough
cheer to keep hundreds of similar stores open year-round throughout
the country _ from Nome to New Orleans.
   ``There is no question in my mind that people are spending more
on Christmas than they used to,'' said Barry Vaill, who owns the
45,000-square-foot store in rural Rhode Island. ``Christmas is in
renaissance.''
   His sales exceeded $1 million last year, but, he said, pointing
to 50 carefully trimmed trees, ``first and foremost, I'm in the
entertainment business _ if they buy something, fine.''
   Last spring, Vaill and 20 other stores formed the National
Independent Christmas Shops, an association to share ideas, offer
support and guard the Christmas image against cut-rate discounters
that use the Christmas name to sell everything from furniture to
flower pots.
   Vaill, the association president, said most year-round Christmas
store owners are drawn to the business by a love of the holiday.
Still, he estimated about 25 percent are trying to capitalize on a
lucrative niche.
   But the Christmas business isn't all merry and it takes a
certain faith to survive.
   ``I don't think you realize what the first quarter is like until
you've been through it,'' said association membership chairwoman
Gayle Boutin, owner of the Christmas House of Stone Mountain, Ga.
She said sales in January and February can drop to 10 percent of
December levels.
   Vaill helps keep more than coal in his summer stocking by
selling decorations for every holiday: St. Patrick's Day trees,
Uncle Sam nutcrackers, Halloween garlands and Thanksgiving dolls.
   Boutin, who had sales of $250,000 in her 1,000-square-foot shop
last year, relies on tourists for much of her trade, as do many
others who locate their stores in historic buildings, from an adobe
in El Paso, Texas, to San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf.
   ``Everybody in every market does it differently,'' said Vaill.
But ``they all claim to be doing well.''
   ``They're all up 20 percent to 25 percent this year and this is
not a good year (for retail sales) so tell me what that means?'' he
said.
   He and Boutin agree an increased interest in collectables has
helped stimulate the industry.
   Annalee Dolls started 30 years ago as a woman's hobby and last
year employed 450 people to make more than 700,000 felt dolls, said
Sam Vachon, executive marketing director of the Meredith, N.H.,
company.
   He said about 15 percent, or 105,000 dolls, go to year-round
Christmas stores. ``Five years ago it was maybe 5 percent,'' he
said.
   ``Every year there are more and more stores carrying Christmas
year-round,'' he said.
   Annalee makes dolls for other holidays, but about three-quarters
are related to Christmas, he said. The reindeer, Santas and such
stand from 3 to 30 inches and retail for $12 to $340.
   ``People have really started decorating for Christmas,'' he
said. ``I think it's a feel-good thing. It makes them feel good.''
   James Heintze, of Derwood, Md., who is writing a guide to
year-round Christmas shops, has identified 150 nationwide.
Annalee's Vachon, however, said he thought there are hundreds. Tiny
Rhode Island boasts at least six.
   Heintze, 47, a professor of American Studies at American
University in Washington, said he hasn't figured out yet why people
shop at Christmas stores off-season, he only knows that they do.
   He theorized that since many families get together only for
Christmas, shopping for the holiday is a reminder of that.
   Mulholland of Cranston had her mother and daughter in tow at the
Christmas House.
   Kim Mulholland, 26, settled on a Buyers' Choice Scrooge caroler
that she put on lay-away.
   Another customer, Mary Bentson, 55, of Dallas, had her sights
set on something less expensive than the $30 to $40 dolls.
   ``I told my sister when I came (to Rhode Island) I wanted to
come buy some little tree ornaments,'' she said.
   Her brother-in-law, Mike DeCarlo, 62, of Providence, had no
qualms about shopping for Christmas during New England's dog day
summer.
   ``There are no crowds, you get the pick of the place, this is
the best time to come,'' he said. ``You come here in the winter and
you can't get in the place.''

   Stock prices fell steeply in heavy trading
today, echoing losses overseas amid continued concern about the
Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 40.85 to
2,640.59 as of noon on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by nearly 6 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 215 up,
1,256 down and 359 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled a strong 97.60
million shares at midday.
   Traders said the volume was boosted by the expiration today of
August contracts on stock futures and options. In addition, they
said, investors were unwilling to buy stock before the weekend due
to the Iraqi conflict.
   The market received a bit of good economic news this morning,
but it appeared to be overshawdowed by Mideast concern and
Thursday's bad report on inflation.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit dropped
to seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June. But analysts expect it
to resume rising once the impact of increasing imported oil prices
takes effect.
   On Thursday, the government reported inflation rose at an
unexpectedly high rate last month. Concern was increased because
the data was measured before the start of the Mideast tension and
its impact on oil prices.
   In Japan, share prices plunged today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, where the key index closed 2.77 percent lower. Traders
said investors were disappointed that Thursday's meeting between
President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein failed to produce a
breakthrough on Iraq.
   Stock prices also were sharply lower in European trading. In
addition, oil prices surged, increasing the pressure on stocks.
   Disappointment over the Iraqi situation, as well as inflationary
concerns, were blamed for Thursday's 66.83-point drop in the Dow to
2,681.44.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks this morning, American
Express fell &rsqb; to 25, Boeing dropped 2&lsqb; to 48{, General Electric
was down 1{ to 63&rsqb; and Philip Morris lost } to 44{.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares fell
2.67 to 180.06. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 333.89, down 2.94.

<TEXT>
   BellSouth Corp. is going ahead with plans to
develop an advanced cellular telephone network in New Zealand,
believed to be the first such system in the Southern Hemisphere.
   The Atlanta-based telecommunications company announced Friday it
was proceeding with the project following approval from the New
Zealand Commerce Commission.
   BellSouth spokeswoman Carlton Hill said the company plans to
spend $100 million over 10 years to develop the network and will
begin offering cellular phone service to New Zealanders in 1992.
   The system will be based on the newly emerging Group Speciale
Mobile (GSM) pan-European standard, a communications system which
is being used as the platform for the introduction of personal
communications service in the United Kingdom.
   Long-term plans include the introduction of fax and other data
applications through the system.
   ``By the mid '90s, we will be assigning telephone numbers to
people, not places,'' said Terry Winters, managing director of
BellSouth New Zealand. ``Our customers will be able to communicate
with each other, no matter where they are, by using a lightweight,
pocket-size, go-anywhere handset.''
   Winters said New Zealand was chosen for the company's first GSM
project because of that country's strong economy and because
customers there have embraced cellular services.

<TEXT>
   The Fantle's drug store chain will be
liquidated after management and the creditors were unable to agree
on a restructuring plan, the company announced today.
   ``The creditors were more desirous of up front cash, viz a viz
long term growth,'' said Sheldon W. Fantle, chairman and chief
executive officer. ``We anticipate that within 90 days the stores
will be fully liquidated and the leases sold.''
   Fantle's, which carries the name of Dart Drug Stores Inc., filed
for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal
bankruptcy law last August. Fantle, the former head of People's
Drug Stores, bought the company three years ago from a management
group which was heavily in debt. He changed the name of the stores
last year.
   The 69 stores in the Washington and Baltimore areas will operate
as usual until a ``going out of business'' sale begins next month,
he said.
   Fantle said he ``regrets that management did not have the time
and resources to implement fully the new and innovative concepts
which the company initiated, but the strong competitive environment
and economic conditions precluded this from happening.''
   A court hearing is scheduled for Aug. 31, he said.

<HEAD>Sears Won't Confirm Report It Plans to Ax Thousands of Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. plans to eliminate
thousands of jobs in coming months to help cut costs and improve
profits, a newspaper reported Friday. Sears would not confirm the
report.
   The move, involving administrative and retail employees, is
expected to result in annual savings of more than $100 million,
according to the Wall Street Journal.
   It cited an unidentified person familiar with the plan.
   The newspaper said the cuts are part of Sears Chairman Edward A.
Brennan's strategy to revive the company's weak retailing business.
   Sears spokesman Doug Fairweather would not confirm the report.
   ``Mr. Brennan is looking at all opportunities to enhance
revenues, improve margins and reduce costs in all areas,''
Fairweather said Friday.
   ``This review is ongoing and no final decisions have been
made,'' said Fairweather. He declined to discuss the matter further.
   According to the Journal, jobs to be eliminated include
administrative staff positions at Sears' headquarters as well as
non-selling positions at the retailer's 850 U.S. stores.
   The Journal's source said Sears hasn't determined how many of
its 337,000 U.S. merchandising employees will go.
   But, the newspaper said, the company hopes to reduce corporate
overhead by combining its 600-member corporate staff with the
merchandise group headquarters staff.
   By the end of the year, Sears expects to eliminate overlapping
jobs in personnel, finance and some positions at the officer level,
the newspaper said.
   An automation system similar to one rival Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.
has adopted to cut costs will be used to take the place of retail
employees in such non-selling positions as customer service and
stocking merchandise, the Journal said.
   The article comes a week after Brennan took control of the
company's Merchandise Group and vowed to cut costs.
   Net income produced by Sears' Merchandise Group tumbled 32
percent during the second quarter of this year, and Sears' stock
has fallen sharply in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
   Ciba-Geigy AG, Switzerland's largest
chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, reported Friday that after-tax
profit dropped 12 percent in the first half of the year because of
economic conditions.
   Earnings fell to 1.216 billion Swiss francs, or $935 million,
from 1.382 billion Swiss francs ($1.06 billion) for the same period
last year.
   First-half sales declined 2 percent to 10.911 billion Swiss
francs ($8.39 billion). A company press release said the Swiss
franc results were adversely affected by the weakening of the
dollar, the yen and the British pound.
   It said that in addition the economic climate was especially
impaired by weak growth in North American automobile, textile and
construction industries and by structural problems in Latin America
and Eastern Europe.
   The company said it expected sales and earnings for all of 1990
to develop at a ``somewhat lower rate than in 1989.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell broadly Friday in Europe,
posting an all-time low against the German mark as worries over
fundamental weakness in the U.S. economy gripped the market.
   Gold rose in steady trading.
   The dollar fell to 1.5485 German marks in Frankfurt from 1.5630
marks late Thursday. It was the lowest close in Europe in the
mark's 42-year history.
   The previous closing low in Europe had been 1.5605 marks set
Wednesday, and the dollar closed at a all-time New York low of
1.5525 marks Thursday.
   At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5575 marks.
   The dollar's latest decline came despite the government's report
of an unexpectedly small U.S. trade deficit for June of $5.07
billion.
   Dealers said pessimism over the condition of the U.S. economy
had eclipsed any bullishness in the dollar.
   ``The overall opinion is that the U.S. economy is so bad (the
market) doesn't really care if those figures are good or not. The
general idea is to sell the dollar,'' a dealer in Frankfurt said.
   Dealers said the dollar was also hurt by reported comments from
West German central bank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In a
newspaper interview published Friday, he said the U.S. currency's
decline fits the central bank's strategy because it reduces West
German import prices.
   This was seen as an invitation to sell the dollar on the
presumption that the influential West German central bank probably
would not intervene to support it.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.55 Japanese yen to 147.35 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 147.65 yen. At midday in New
York, the dollar was quoted at 147.35 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9195 from $1.8985 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.97425 at midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Thursday included: 1.2815 Swiss francs, down from 1.3025; -5.2045
French francs, down from 5.2495; 1.7445 Dutch guilders, down from
1.7610; 1,141.75 Italian lire, down from 1,149.75, and 1.1440
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1477.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.2795
Swiss francs, 1,149.75 Italian lire and 1.4375 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose to $409.25 a troy ounce in London from $403.50 late
Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $408.25 an ounce from $401.25
late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $9.95 to close at $410.96.
   Silver rose in London to $5.20 a troy ounce from $5.13 late
Thursday.

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange sank
Friday to their lowest levels since April, depressed by fears about
the course of the Middle East crisis.
   Dealers said traders were also squaring positions before the
weekend to protect themselves against any unexpected developments
in the Gulf region.
   Only four stocks in the closely watched Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index escaped the onslaught, all of them oil
companies. The international sector, undermined by a surging pound,
included some of the day's biggest losers.
   At the close, the FT-SE 100-share index stood at 2,176.9, down
45.2 points, or 2 percent.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was down 46.0 points
to 1,678.9. The 500-share index was down 25.09 points at 1,174.43.
   Volume was 500.5 million issues, compared with the 375.4 million
shares traded Thursday.

<TEXT>
   About 270 Atlantic Richfield Co. stations
have run out of regular unleaded gasoline during the past week as
demand surged for its low-priced fuel and a refinery fire reduced
supplies, Arco said.
   Arco froze its prices to dealers indefinitely after President
Bush asked oil companies to exercise restraint following Iraq's
invasion of oil-rich Kuwait.
   Then a fire Monday at Arco's refinery in Carson cut production
from 235,000 barrels a day to 205,000. Production is expected to be
back to full production next Monday, Arco spokesman Doug Elmets
said.
   Arco, which sells gas at about 1,700 stations in five Western
states, said its sales volume has risen 9 percent since it
announced the freeze on Aug. 8. It said nearly all the 270 stations
that posted temporary ``sold out'' signs are in Southern California
and the Phoenix and Las Vegas areas.
   Elmets said it has taken an average of 2{ hours to replenish
tanks of regular unleaded gas at the stations.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Settles All Claims with NLRB</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nordstrom Inc. said today it has settled all
outstanding labor claims with the National Labor Relations Board,
but a union official questioned whether the year-long dispute with
the clothing-store chain is over.
   Thirteen of the 19 charges filed by the United Food and
Commercial Workers Union have been dismissed or withdrawn, said Joe
Demarte, Nordstrom vice president for personnel.
   He said the company would sign a settlement agreement later in
the day.
   ``Nordstrom in no way admits it has committed any violations of
law by signing the settlement,'' said Nordstrom spokesman Dave
Marriott.
   But the union will not be party to a settlement ``unless
Nordstrom admits it has done what they have been accused of,'' said
president Joe Peterson of UFCW Local 1001, which represents some of
the retailer's 1,500 area workers.
   ``As far as we're concerned the company's problems are far from
over,'' Peterson said.
   The settlement concerns complaints filed over Nordstrom's
relationship with the union and its role in a union decertification
effort. The agreement covers one Tacoma store and five Seattle-area
Nordstrom stores, whose employees are represented by UFCW Locals
367 and 1001.
   Under the settlement, Nordstrom will be required to post for 60
days a notice explaining NLRB findings to employees as well as
company actions required under the settlement, Marriott said.
   The company has promised not to punish employees for union
activities or to offer benefits to employees that are effective
only if the union is ousted, he said. The retailer also has agreed
to provide certain information requested by the union, Marriott
said.
   The company also will allow pro-union employees the same
privileges as anti-union workers in the matters of distributing
handbills and posting fliers, he said.
   ``The settlement wipes the slate clean in terms of the unfair
labor practice charges that have been filed by the union,'' Demarte
said.
   ``We felt it was more important to reach a settlement of the
issues pending before the NLRB rather than continuing to debate the
merits of the union's allegations,'' he said.
   But Peterson said Nordstrom wants the settlement so a new union
decertification petition can be circulated, adding that the process
cannot begin while there are charges pending before the NLRB.
   The union has five days to object after the settlement is
signed, said NLRB regional attorney Walter Mercer.
   The union is in the process of filing new charges against the
retailer, Peterson said, adding that ``there will not be an
election or decertification in the near future.''
   The new charges will involve alleged discrimination against
union negotiators at a store south of Seattle, Peterson said.
   The union also plans appeals on four other charges the labor
board ruled against, he said.
   The UFCW represents about 1,500 of Nordstrom's Seattle-area
employees. Nordstrom employs about 30,000 people nationwide.
   In February, the Washington State Department of Labor and
Industries ruled that Nordstrom had violated state law by failing
to pay some employees for such activities as attending company
meetings, making deliveries and writing customer thank-you notes.
   A union lawsuit seeks back pay for the workers.

   Corn and soybean futures closed higher and wheat
ended lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after a day of
choppy trading in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand
developments.
   Weather forecasts remained beneficial for corn and soybean
development and export demand remained weak, leaving traders with
nothing to do but play ``a money game,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager
of trading-floor operations for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   ``We just keep chopping around and everybody buys the rallies
and everybody sells the breaks,'' he said.
   The markets opened lower, led by a 9 cents-a-bushel drop in
soybeans, then rallied at mid-morning.
   But ``there was no news at all today, no significant business to
account for the rally, no significant news to account for the
break,'' Zusel said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.82\ a bushel; corn was
1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with September at $2.51{ a bushel; oats

   Stock prices fell steeply in heavy trading
today, echoing losses overseas amid continued concern about the
Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 43.57 to
2,637.87 as of 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by nearly 6 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 242 up,
1,399 down and 321 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled a strong 172.50
million shares.
   Traders said the volume was boosted by the expiration today of
August contracts on stock futures and options.
   In addition, they said, investors seemed unwilling to buy stock
before the weekend due to the Iraqi conflict, furthering the drop
in prices.
   The market received a bit of good economic news this morning,
but it appeared to be overshawdowed by Mideast concern and
Thursday's bad report on inflation.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit dropped
to seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June. But analysts expect it
to resume rising once the impact of increasing imported oil prices
takes effect.
   On Thursday, the government reported inflation rose at an
unexpectedly high rate last month. Concern was increased because
the data was measured before the start of the Mideast tension and
its impact on oil prices.
   In Japan, share prices plunged today on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, where the key index closed 2.77 percent lower. Traders
said investors were disappointed that Thursday's meeting between
President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein failed to produce a
breakthrough on Iraq.
   Stock prices also closed sharply lower in European trading. In
addition, oil prices surged, increasing the pressure on stocks.
   Disappointment over the Iraqi situation, as well as inflationary
concerns, were blamed for Thursday's 66.83-point drop in the Dow to
2,681.44.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks today, American Express fell
\ to 25&lsqb;, Boeing dropped 2\ to 48&rsqb;, General Electric was down ~to
64 and Philip Morris lost } to 44{.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common shares fell
3.17 to 179.56. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index stood at 332.13, down 4.70.

<HEAD>Hourly Chrysler Workers Offered Buyout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp., which is trying to reduce its
salaried work force as a cost-cutting move, is offering nearly all
of its 60,000 or so unionized employees money to leave the company.
   Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler said Friday that 400 to 450 of
the eligible workers had chosen the buyout so far. Another week is
left for workers to sign up. The last day of work for anyone
choosing to leave will be Aug. 31.
   ``It's a positive alternative to layoffs,'' Sechler said. ``I
think everybody is looking at ways to cut back and reduce costs.''
   Last October, Chrysler began a program to carve $1 billion from
its $26 billion annual budget by the end of this year. Since then,
the target has risen to $1.5 billion.
   Included in the cuts were the early retirements of about 2,500,
or more than 11 percent, from Chrysler's salaried work force.
   Sechler declined to say how much Chrysler's ``voluntary
termination of employment program'' for its union-covered employees
will cost. He also declined to give the formula used to calculate
the buyout amount, but said it would be based heavily on the
employee's seniority with the company. Workers employed with
Chrysler for at least one year are eligible.
   Originally, executives estimated that about 600 workers would
sign up for the buyouts, Sechler said.
   Sechler said the program, contained in the 1988 contract between
Chrysler and the United Auto Workers union, was begun in late July
or early August.
   The UAW and each of the Big Three are involved in national
contract negotiations. The current agreements, covering more than
450,000 workers, expire Sept. 14.
   Chrysler is the nation's No. 3 automaker. No. 1 General Motors
Corp. has been involved since 1987 in a formal cost-cutting program
called the ``Action Plan'' which is expected to cut about $13
billion in costs by the end of this year. Ford Motor Co. has no
formal cost-cutting program, but says it constantly looks for ways
to reduce expenses.

   The U.S. Export-Import Bank said Friday it is
ready to guarantee a $1.37 billion credit to help an American
aerospace firm compete for a Turkish order of 200 helicopters.
   The government-operated bank said it notified Congress of the
loan guarantee after reviewing the international situation and
evaluating Turkey's credit worthiness.
   United Technologies Corp. of Hartford, Conn., is competing for
the order against Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH of West Germany and Agusta of
Italy, the announcement said.
   United Technologies hopes to sell the Turkish Defense Ministry
kits for final assembly in Turkey between 1992-94 of 200 Sikorsky
UH-50L general utility helicopters expected to cost about $1.5
billion, said the Bank.
   The unarmed helicopters would be used for reconnaissance,
medical evacuation and search and rescue.
   The Bank said it is allowed by law to make an exception to its
policy against financing military equipment sales. Under that
exception, the Bank may guarantee loans for commercial sales of
defense hardware for Greece and Turkey provided the purchases are
not for use on Cyprus.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweaters made of synthetic fibers in Taiwan
are being sold in the United States at less than fair market value,
the Commerce Department ruled Friday.
   The National Knitwear &amp; Spsortswear Association in New York had
filed complaints last September against sweater manufacturers in
South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   The department had ruled against the manufacturers in Hong Kong
on July 21 and against those in South Korea on Aug. 3.
   The findings clear the way for the International Trade
Commission to determine whether the products are harming U.S.
industry. If the commission finds U.S. firms are being damaged, the
government can impose duties on the imports to make their prices
comparable to those of U.S. companies.
   The department said the imports represent 72 percent of the $1.3
billion U.S. market and the three countries represent 55 percent of
the imports. It said the value of the sweaters imported from South
Korea in 1989 was $476.1 million; from Hong Kong, $208.8 million;
and Taiwan, $485.5 million.
   The department said the imports are made predominantly of
acrylic fiber. Sweaters containing at least 23 percent wool are
excluded.

   Isn't that Foster Grant in bankruptcy court?
   The company, whose ads asking which star was behind its
sunglasses produced sales and advertising prominence, has sought
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from creditors.
   Industry executives said Foster Grant Corp. foundered in the
last decade after failing to capitalize on its catchy and
successful print and television ads of the 1960s and '70s that
asked ``Isn't that . . . behind those Foster Grants?''
   In papers filed Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Tuscon,
Ariz., it reported total assets of about $25 million and
liabilities of about $36 million, including nearly $19.3 million in
unsecured debt.
   Foster Grant, founded in 1919 by Sam Foster, was the first
company to use abrasion-resistant lens coatings that blocked the
sun's ultra-violet rays, but is best known for its advertisements.
   The first of 17 print ads debuted in 1965 and featured Peter
Sellers behind a pair of Foster Grants. Other entertainment
personalities including Woody Allen, Vanessa Redgrave, Julie
Christie, Raquel Welch and Jane Fonda appeared in the ads, which
ran until 1968.
   A series of television ads followed, and commercials later
featured non-stars and asked, ``Isn't that you behind those Foster
Grants.''
   Despite the success of a campaign still remembered today, Foster
Grant's recognizable name ``never really took them into the high
level part of the market,'' said Mauri Edwards, Foster Grant's vice
president of marketing from 1964-73.
   ``It came through the '70s in pretty good shape but the thing
went downhill rapidly in the 80s,'' said Edwards, who now manages
public relations for the Sunglass Association of America.
   He said Foster Grant began its downturn after the death in 1971
of Joe Foster, whose father in 1929 sold a 50 percent interest in
what was then a small maker of sunglasses and combs to what is now
Goody Products.
   In 1975, Foster Grant, with more than $300 million in sales of
petrochemicals, sunglasses and other products, was sold to the U.S.
arm of the West German chemicals concern Hoechst AG.
   It then was acquired by the American unit of the French
pharmaceutical and chemical company Roussel-Uclaf SA. The company
sold its bulk plastic making operations in the 1970s.
   In 1986, Foster Grant was acquired by Andlinger &amp; Co., a private
investment banking and management company.
   Foster Grant vice president Ed Russell blamed the bankruptcy
court filing on cash flow problems and low profit margins resulting
from competition from Asian imports.
   ``The company had not been profitable in 1989, nor in the first
half of 1990,'' he said, adding that loss figures still were being
compiled.
   The company said it sold more than $50 million of sunglasses,
eyeglasses and related lens products in 1989, compared with with
$55 million in 1983. In the same period, U.S. retail sales of
nonprescription sunglasses rose to $1.7 billion from $885 million,
according to industry figures.
   Foster Grant, which had as many as 2,000 seasonal employees in
the 1960s, said it was laying off 345 of 475 employees at its main
distribution center in Tucson, an assembly plant in Nogales,
Mexico, and a plant in Leominster, Mass., for one week starting
Monday.
   Foster Grant still is one of top names in the mass sunglass
industry, where glasses sell for under $10. Opti-Ray Inc., owned by
Goody Products of Kearny, N.J., is considered the leader in that
field, along with Bonneau of Dallas.
   The market for more expensive sunglasses is led by Bausch &amp; Lomb
Inc. of Rochester, N.Y., maker of the Ray-Ban line. Other popular
brands include the French sunglasses Vuarnet and Bolle.
   Foster Grant's technical products division supplies products to
the computer, automotive, sporting goods and electro-mechanical
industries.

<HEAD>FundAmerica Files for Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FundAmerica Inc., a buying club with 100,000
members, filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors Friday
and asked the court to appoint an independent examiner to
investigate various allegations against it.
   The Irvine, Calif.-based firm is facing scrutiny from regulators
in Florida and other states and is the subject of a $150 million
class-action suit in San Francisco.
   Its federal bankruptcy filing in Santa Ana, which had been
expected, listed assets of $17.5 million and liabilities of $14.5
million.
   ``Prompt and decisive action had to be taken to preserve
FundAmerica's viability for its members and marketers,'' said
Mitchell G. Blumberg, its president and chief executive.
   Critics say FundAmerica's discounts on goods and services are
available free through other channels or are subsidized by its
membership fees. In lawsuits they allege the company's true
business is high-pressure marketing of memberships in packages of
40 at $80 apiece.
   Florida officials have charged FundAmerica founder Robert T.
Edwards with fraud for allegedly bilking club members out of $8.2
million in an illegal pyramid scheme.
   FundAmerica has not been convicted of any crimes.
   The Chapter 11 filing gives the company breathing room from
creditors while it tries to sort out its problems. Blumberg, a past
associate of Edwards in real estate, said the filing would give
FundAmerica time to develop marketing plans acceptable to
regulators.
   He said he believed it would allow the company to automatically
lift a freeze on assets that was reaffirmed Wednesday by Marilyn
Hall Patel, the federal judge in the class-action suit. He said
FundAmerica would ask the bankruptcy judge to use company funds to
meet its payroll.
   Blumberg said the company was reviewing the legal challenges
against it and invited the bankruptcy court to appoint an
independent examiner.
   ``We are confident that we are delivering an honest and valuable
product via an honest, credible and reputable marketing
organization,'' he said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   The dollar sank to another all-time low Friday
against the German mark and fell against most other major
currencies, reflecting continuing pessimism about the state of the
U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were mixed. After gold posted gains in other
markets, Republic National Bank in New York quoted an after-hours
bid of $408.50 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 50 cents from
Thursday's late bid.
   The dollar fell to an all-time closing low of 1.5485 German
marks in Europe from 1.5630 marks late Thursday. Its previous
closing low in Europe had been 1.5605 marks set Wednesday.
   In New York, the dollar ended at 1.5500 marks, a new low for
that market. The dollar's previous lowest close in New York had
been 1.5525 marks on Thursday.
   For the week, the dollar sank 6.7 percent against the mark in
domestic dealings.
   In other dealings Friday, the dollar fell against every major
currency but the Japanese yen in New York trading after falling
broadly overseas.
   The latest decline came despite the government's report of an
unexpectedly small U.S. trade deficit for June of $5.07 billion.
   Despite the improvement, dealers said traders shunned the dollar
because they feel the economy may be headed into a recession and
that the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to encourage lower
interest rates.
   When U.S. rates are falling relative to those in other
countries, the dollar is less appealing to foreign investors.
   ``Dollar traders are just not interested in the trade picture,''
said Walter Simon, a currency options trader at Bank Julius Baer &amp;
Co. ``They are interested in the whole weakening of the U.S.
economic climate.''
   He said the dollar finished above its lows because of some late
dollar-buying by traders who were reluctant to leave themselves
exposed over the weekend to the possibility that flareups in the
Persian Gulf could push the dollar higher.
   ``The United States seems to be taking a lot more aggressive
posture toward Iraq,'' Simon said.
   But he said the dollar is demonstrating only limited appeal as a
haven currency during this international conflict, which began with
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Dealers in Europe said the dollar was hurt by reported comments
from West German central bank Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. He
was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying the dollar's decline
fits the central bank's strategy because it reduces West German
import prices.
   This was seen as an invitation to sell the dollar without the
risk that the German central bank would move to brake its fall,

   Stock prices fell broadly Friday in heavy
trading, echoing losses overseas amid continued concern about the
Mideast.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 36.64 to
2,644.80, its lowest close since March 1. Earlier in the session,
the Dow was down by as much as 65 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 4 to 1
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 310 up, 1,330 down and 365 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 212.56 million
shares, up from 138.85 million Thursday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 262.71 million shares.
   Traders said the volume was boosted by the expiration of August
contracts on stock-index futures and options at the close of
trading, producing a so-called double-witching hour. Expiration of
the options contracts helped boost prices in the final hour, they
said.
   Earlier in the session, the Dow's steep drop set off a market
``circuit breaker'' designed to prevent a price freefall. The
mechanism, triggered by a 50-point Dow decline, bars sales
connected to index-futures arbitrage until the prices of the stocks
involved rise.
   The price drop was amplified by the unwillingness of investors
to buy stocks before the weekend due to uncertainty over the Iraqi
conflict, said Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at
Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Though there was little news from the Mideast, A.C. Moore,
director of research at Argus Research in New York, said the market
has started to realize that ``the domestic economy is indeed in a
shaky position and in no real position to withstand an oil price
increase.''
   Oil prices continued to surge Friday, sending prices of oil
stocks higher.
   The market shrugged off a bit of good economic news. The
Commerce Department said the nation's trade deficit dropped to
seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June. But analysts expect the
deficit to resume rising once the impact of increasing imported oil
prices takes effect.
   In Japan, disappointment with the lack of progress in the
Mideast sent share prices plunging on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the key index closed 2.77 percent lower. Prices also closed
sharply lower in London.
   Wal-Mart was the most-active NYSE issue, falling 1&lsqb; to 28 as
4.14 million shares changed hands. The company said it knew of no
reason for the activity.
   Among most-active blue-chip stocks on the NYSE, Boeing dropped
2&lsqb; to 48{, AT&amp;T fell ~ to 33&rsqb;, General Electric was down ~ to 64,
Philip Morris was unchanged at 45\ and IBM fell 2&rsqb; to 101&rsqb;.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $48.225 billion, or 1.52
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.54 to 180.19.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 5.69 to 386.73, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index dropped 4.56 to 327.83.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market lost
8.78 to 393.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index dropped 3.22 to 333.61.

<HEAD>Paper Company Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James River Corp. unveiled a major
restructuring Thursday that includes the sale or shutdown of $1.3
billion in specialty operations that have not been profitable.
   The announcement was made at the paper company's annual
shareholders' meeting in Richmond.
   In a statement, James River said its restructuring would
increase the resources available for expansion and ``allow the
company to simplify its structure so that it can concentrate on
global growth opportunities in those James River businesses in
which it commands a substantial market share, which are less
cyclical and which have the highest potential to provide James
River with competitive advantage.''
   The restructuring, to be completed within a year, will allow
James River to focus on four core areas: towels and tissues, Dixie
food service products, food and consumer packaging, and
communication papers.
   The operations to be divested or closed include business papers
units in Berlin-Gorham and Groveton, N.H., and in Wiggins, Miss.;
coated printed papers operations in West Linn, Ore.; and towel and
tissue operations in South Glens Falls, N.Y., and Ashland, Wis.
   The company plans to use cash from operations that are sold to
reduce debt and repurchase stock. The repurchase could involve up
to 8 million shares, depending on market conditions.
   ``The financial flexibility provided by these actions is
designed to support a major capital investment program to grow the
company's core businesses,'' the company said.
   The operations that are targeted for new spending are in
Alabama, Louisiana, Michigan, Maine, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin
and Ontario, Canada.
   Restructuring charges on first-quarter results are expected to
reach about $150 million, the company said, and probably will cause
a loss for the period.
   James River's stock closed at $22.87{ Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 25 cents.
   James River, based in Richmond, manufactures pulp, paper and
plastic products. Sales for the fiscal year ending April 29 were $6
billion.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela on Friday continued trying
to persuade a majority of OPEC nations to meet to discuss oil
production increases in wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Energy and Mines Minister Celestino Armas said Venezuela was
lobbying hard to get at least seven of the 13 Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries to the table in order to work out an
agreement to cover at least part of Iraq and Kuwait's 4.6 million
barrels per day of blocked supply.
   Armas sent a letter dated Friday to OPEC President Sadek
Boussena calling for the meeting to decide on production increases.
   ``Continuing interruption of energy could seriously damage the
long-term prospects of the petroleum industry, for the producers as
well as the consumers,'' said the letter, which was also sent to
OPEC's secretary general. In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, informed oil
industry sources reported that Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar and Kuwait were responsive to a Saudi call for an emergency
session.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said a
meeting may be convened either Monday or Tuesday in Geneva.
   They said Iraq, Libya and Ecuador were opposed to the proposal,
while Indonesia has suggested a consultation rather than an
emergency ministerial session.
   Algeria, Nigeria, Gabon and Iran have not yet taken a stand,
they said. Iran in the past has sought to maximize prices.
   Iraq's oil minister on Friday lashed out at the proposal for an
emergency meeting, insisting that the shortfall was created by the
Saudi blocking of Iraqi oil exports from its trans-Saudi oil
pipeline.
   The state-run Iraqi News Agency quoted minister Issam al-Chalabi
as describing the call for the session as ``an attempt to add
legitimacy to the justification of overproduction,'' in violation
of an OPEC agreement reached July 28 in Geneva.
   It was not immediately clear whether a small group or the cartel
ministers would meet separately should the rest refuse to attend
the proposed emergency meeting.
   In Venezuela, Armas indicated an agreement with several other
OPEC nations was possible if attempts at full consensus fail.
   ``This would be a formula to explore,'' he said.
   Nor did he rule out a production increase by Venezuela alone.
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he said.
   Armas emphasized that Venezuela had responsibilities to its
clients, among them the United States, which buys about half of
Venezuela's 1.94 million barrel daily output and has asked
Venezuela to produce another 500,000 barrels.
   ``Venezuela is responding to its hemispheric responsibilities,''
Armas said. ``We have a responsibility to countries who are our
friends.''
   He admitted that Venezuela initially increased production after
the United States had asked for more oil, then changed its mind and
turned off the taps.
   He said Venezuela at first had thought it a good idea to
increase its inventories, but changed its mind after realizing that
``this action could be misinterpreted by the market'' as a plan to
unilaterally sell more oil, Armas said.
   Among other OPEC members, Saudi Arabia has the potential to
produce an estimated 1 million to 2 million barrels more a day, and
the U.A.E. about 500,000 more.

<TEXT>
   The sudden rise in oil prices is jolting cities and states
across the country already struggling with some of their worst
budget woes in years.
   Restrictions on government travel have been ordered in Indiana,
thermostats are being adjusted in government office buildings in
Baltimore and oil suppliers are being served notice in New York
that price gougers will be remembered come contract time.
   ``This is just another whammy along with the other cutbacks from
the federal government we've received over the last 10 years,'' J.
Thomas Cochran, executive director of the Washington-based U.S.
Conference of Mayors, said in an interview Friday.
   ``One of the things we learned from the last oil crisis in the
1970s was the tremendous amount of gasoline and fuel that cities
use in their fleets and in government buildings. This is definitely
an item that will have an impact on their budgets,'' he said.
   Actual service cuts have been slight just two weeks after the
Persian Gulf crisis sent world oil prices soaring, according to
budget officials interviewed this week by The Associated Press.
   What worries them most is the heightened prospect of a recession.
   ``It could be a killer,'' said Rex Olliff, finance specialist
for Los Angeles. ``With a recession it would be difficult to get
through this year. And next year there would be a real problem.''
   Sustained oil price increases of 25 percent to 30 percent would
almost certainly bring about deep municipal and state service cuts,
other budget officials added.
   Virginia, already struggling with its worst budget shortfall
since World War II, $1.4 billion for 1990-92, faces $2 million in
added costs if fuel prices remain where they are. Department of
Transportation officials say they might make up the difference by
putting off highway maintenance.
   ``The oil prices are just one added burden, to be sure,'' said
Ellen Davenport of the Virginia Association of Counties.
   New York City figures each penny rise in gasoline prices will
add $166,500 to the cost of fueling its 24,000-car municipal fleet.
   John Beckman, spokesman for the general services department,
said the city is warning heating oil and gasoline suppliers that
the city intends to punish price gouging.
   ``We are going to be scrutinizing them to see who gouged us and
who treated us fairly. The people with whom we contract should be
cognizant of that. Because at contract time, we're going to
remember,'' he said.
   Boston, already $13 million short in its $1.36 billion budget
for the fiscal year that began July 1, could see $2.5 million in
additional red ink if fuel prices go up 30 percent, said Barbara
Gottschalk, the city budget director.
   A few energy-producing states believe they'll come out winners
if oil prices continue upward.
   In Texas, state comptroller Bob Bullock estimates the treasury
would gain $50 million for every $1-per-barrel oil price increase.
New Mexico, the seventh-largest oil-producing state, would realize
$4 million a year for every dollar-a-barrel rise.
   Alaska's revenue department calculates that if oil prices remain
at current levels through the next year, the state will have a
nearly $300 million surplus by next July.
   But other cities and states less optimistic about their fortunes
have already taken modest savings steps.
   ``We will be turning thermostats down and wearing more sweaters
in anticipation of costs rising this winter,'' said Baltimore
finance director William R. Brown Jr.
   Connecticut, its budget already $244 million in the red, is
paying 13 cents more per gallon than a year ago for the 7.5 million
gallons needed to fuel its state car fleet and police cruisers.
State officials prepared a memo asking state car users to cut back
on their driving.
   Albuquerque, N.M., and Rhode Island, are talking about cutting
back on city car fleets or restricting take-home car use. Wyoming
may cut back on out-of-state air travel by state officials.
   Indiana Lt. Gov. Frank O'Bannon sent a memo ordering state
agencies to increase car pooling and cut back on discretionary
travel.
   In North Carolina, David Crotts, the state legislature's senior
fiscal analyst, said rising oil prices could create a $100 million
shortfall in revenue projections, potentially wiping out much of a
$141 million state ``rainy day fund.'' State agencies already have
cut back on travel budgets.
   Meanwhile, Minnesota Rideshare, a state-funded agency that
promotes car pooling, and the Metropolitan Transit Commission,
which operates buses, ran advertisements in local newspapers
Thursday showing a picture of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It's about time we showed this guy we don't need his oil. Take
the bus or Rideshare and you do just that,'' the ad said.

<HEAD>Truck Maker Reports Decline in Revenues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navistar International Corp. said Thursday its
income for the third quarter dropped 78.6 percent to $6 million,
due largely to continuing weak demand for medium and heavy trucks.
   The Chicago-based truck maker, which blamed a 77 percent drop in
second-quarter earnings on slow sales, said Monday that it was
suspending assembly operations in its Springfield, Ohio and
Chatham, Ontario, plants for five days to balance production with
retail demand.
   Chatham operations will be suspended for an additional 10 days
in September and Springfield's medium-truck assembly line will be
shut down for another five days in October, the company said.
   For the quarter ending July 31, Navistar reported earnings of $6
million on sales of $972 million, compared to earnings of $28
million on sales of $1.08 billion for the same 1989 period.
   After dividends on the Series G preferred stock, income per
common share broke even for the third quarter. The company reported
earnings of 8 cents per share for the 1989 period.
   For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, Navistar reported a
net loss of $4 million, or 10 cents per share, on sales of $2.8
billion, compared to earnings of $100 million, or 31 cents per
share, on sales of $3.2 billion during the 1989 period.
   James C. Cotting, chairman and chief executive officer of
Navistar, said industrywide retail sales of medium and heavy trucks
in North America were 74,400 in the third quarter, down 14 percent
from the 86,900 sold during the same period last year.
   Cotting said retail sales of the company's International medium
and heavy trucks totaled 20,300 in the third quarter, compared to
23,800 trucks during the same period in 1989. He said shipments of
mid-range diesel engines increased 4 percent during the period over
last year. Service parts sales were 12 percent higher.
   Cotting also said the current crisis in the Middle East has
increased the fear of recession among some truck owners and
operators. If that situation continues, it could further depress
the truck market, he said.

<HEAD>Selloff Foreseen in Cattle Futures Following Feedlot Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Livestock analysts on Friday predicted a sharp drop in cattle
futures prices after a government report showed far more cattle
were placed on feedlots last month than the market had expected.
   The anticipated drop of at least a penny a pound would extend
losses posted Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of
the report.
   On other commodity markets Friday, pork futures were mixed; oil
and gasoline futures skyrocketed; precious metals rose; and grains
and soybeans were mixed.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent to .57 cent lower in
Chicago with the contract for delivery in August at 77.90 cents a
pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .67 cent lower with August
at 89.65 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .35 cent lower
with August at 57.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .83
cent lower to 1.17 cents higher with August at 48.12 cents a pound.
   In a report released after the close of trading, the Agriculture
Department said 7 million cattle were on U.S. feedlots as of Aug.
1, 4 percent more than on that date a year ago.
   The USDA said July feedlot placements rose 18 percent over a
year ago while July marketings off of feedlots rose 3 percent.
   Market analysts were most surprised by the placements figure,
which compared with expectations for about a 6 percent increase.
   Charles K. Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said the placements total of 1.5 million head was the
third largest ever for July and 19 percent above the 10-year
avearge.
   The July placements represent young cattle sold or moved to
feedlots to be fattened on grain for slaughter in November and
December.
   Levitt said feedlot operators aggressively sought animals in
July because the feedlot business had been profitable that month
and because feed-grain prices were declining, suggesting the
profitability would continue.
   A bountiful winter wheat harvest in the Southern Plains, where
many feedlots are located, contributed to a drop in wheat prices
from about $3.30 to less than $3 a bushel in July, making wheat an
economical and readily available alternative to corn as a feed
grain, Levitt said.
   July placements also were higher than expected because good
growing conditions had extended the usable life of the pastures on
which young cattle are raised before they are moved to feedlots for
finishing.
   Instead of moving animals to feedlots through the spring, many
producers kept their cattle on pastures until July, when pasture
conditions finally deteriorated, Levitt said.
   Petroleum futures soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
Middle East tensions escalated.
   As the Persian Gulf crisis entered its third week, evidence
mounted that Iraq intends to intern hundreds of trapped Americans,
and President Bush decided to call up military reserves to meet the
need for doctors and other specialists.
   Analysts attributed an explosive jump in gasoline futures to
reports of tight supplies of unleaded gasoline that meets the
environmental requirements of the Northeast.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said about 270 of its stations in the
Southwest had run out of regular unleaded gasoline as demand surged
and a refinery fire reduced supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .34 cent to 1.27 cents
higher with September at $28.63 a barrel; heating oil was 3 cents
to 5.07 cents higher with September at 80.54 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 2.65 cents to 8.51 cents higher with
September at 95.97 cents a gallon.
   Most precious metals rose modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reflecting inflation fears fed by the rise in oil prices.
   Gold settled 10 cent lower to 40 cents higher with August at
$409.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with
August at $5.179 a troy ounce.
   Corn and soybean futures rose but wheat ended lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade after a day of choppy trading in the absence
of fresh supply-and-demand developments.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with September at
$2.82\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 1} cents higher with September
at $2.50} a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2\ cents lower with
September at $1.15} a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 8 cents
higher with August at $6.15 a bushel.

<HEAD>Mideast, Inflation Concerns Batter Markets Going Into Uncertain
Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL MENEZES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors dumped stocks and dollars again Friday
as oil and gasoline prices shot higher and uncertainty intensified
about the desert standoff against Iraq and its effect on the weak
U.S. economy.
   Other markets showed more stability, but trading remained
nervous going into the weekend.
   On Wall Street, sellers took the offensive for most of the day
amid speculation that the economy _ already in a recession by some
accounts _ would suffer further from expensive oil resulting from
Iraq's seizure of Kuwait and its threat to other key Persian Gulf
oil states.
   Trading trends shifted constantly, with blue-chip issues falling
sharply at the outset before staging periodic rallies to finish
well above the day's lows.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended down 36.64 at
2,644.80. At one point in the session the best-known average of
Wall Street was down more than 60 points.
   More than four stocks fell for every one that rose on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Reflecting the depth of the market retreat was the selloff of
the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which many consider a more
accurate barometer of the market's health than the Dow average. The
index fell 4.56 points to 327.83, giving it a more than 3.5 percent
drop on Thursday and Friday alone.
   Inflation and recession worries had been blamed partly for the
Dow average's nearly 67-point drop on Thursday.
   Traders said Friday that investors also seemed unwilling to buy
stock before the weekend due to the uncertainties posed by the
Persian Gulf conflict, worsening the day's decline.
   Oil and gas prices again rose sharply as traders continued
betting that the standoff between Iraq and a multinational force
led by the United States would hamper supplies.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for September delivery rose $1.27 to $28.63 per barrel. That
compared with about $21 a barrel just before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait touched off the crisis.
   In further bad news for consumers and businesses alike, unleaded
gasoline skyrocketed higher, finishing at the highest level since
it began trading in late 1984 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
September wholesale unleaded gas closed up 8.51 cents at 95.97
cents a gallon.
   A favorable U.S. trade report from Washington did little to
settle Wall Street down and provided only temporary help for the
dollar, which declined in New York after plunging in Europe.
   The Commerce Department said the trade deficit dropped to a
seven-year low of $5.07 billion in June, although the imbalance was
expected to rise due to the surge in oil import prices.
   The dollar traded at 1.5500 German marks late Friday in New
York, compared with 1.5525 late Thursday, a new all-time low.
Earlier in Frankfurt, however, the dollar had plummeted to 1.5485
marks from 1.5630 late Thursday.
   In the credit markets, the yield on the Treasury's key 30-year
bond rose to about 8.93 percent from 8.92 percent late Thursday.
   Foreign markets also continued suffering from Persian Gulf and
economic worries.
   Overnight in Japan, the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
plunged by 2.77 percent. Traders in Tokyo said many investors were
disappointed that Thursday's meeting between President Bush and
Jordan's King Hussein failed to produce any breakthrough in the
Iraqi stalemate.
   Stock prices also were sharply lower in European trading, with
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index on the London
exchange down 2 percent.

and state regulatory agencies Thursday to reject Kansas City Power
and Light Co.'s hostile takeover bid.
   The Wichita utility, which is opposing the $875 million
purchase, made its request to the Kansas Corporation Commission and
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It said the takeover bid
will cost the two utilities at least $15 million.
   KG&amp;E said in its motion to FERC that the KCPL application to
approve the merger should be rejected because the KG&amp;E board has
not consented to the deal.
   KG&amp;E also said the tender offer is subject to ``significant and
fundamental conditions which make it virtually impossible for KCPL
actually to acquire KG&amp;E under the terms and conditions set forth
in the application.''
   In addition, the utility said KCPL's attempted takeover ``should
not be aided or facilitated in any way by FERC'' and noted that
merging utilities seeking approval from FERC have, until now,
reached agreement on all aspects of the merger before submitting to
FERC an application that has their joint support.
   ``KCPL's decision to acquire KG&amp;E by hostile means disrupts all
possibilities of further coordination between the two companies
during the hostile takeover period and forces both companies to
incur millions of dollars for commitment fees, other costs and
disbursements for bankers, lawyers and financial consultants,'' the
Wichita utility said.
   KG&amp;E estimated that KCPL has spent or committed expenditures of
more than $10 million for the takeover bid. KG&amp;E estimated its own
costs at $4.5 million.
   In a separate motion, KG&amp;E cited several reasons for the state
commission to reject the KCPL filing:
   _ The tender offer is believed by KG&amp;E to be illegal.
   _ The KG&amp;E board did not consent to the KCPL application or
acquisition.
   _ The tender offer is highly conditional, making it virtually
impossible that KCPL will acquire KG&amp;E anytime soon under
conditions set forth in its application to the KCC.

<HEAD>Retailers to Ask More Time for Filing Chapter 11 Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. said Friday they were asking a federal judge for more
time to file a plan for emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. is to conduct a hearing
Sept. 11 on the request to postpone the filing deadline to Feb. 28,
1991. Federated and Allied said the extension would allow them to
concentrate on the Christmas retailing season.
   It would be the second extension granted by Aug for the
companies' exclusive right to file a reorganization plan,
independent of creditors. Aug on May 10 granted an extension
through Sept. 12.
   Lawyers for the Cincinnati-based retailers recently told Aug
they expected to request a second extension because of the
complexity and scope of the reorganization effort. Federated and
Allied operate 256 department stores in 28 states and employ about
100,000 people.
   Lewis Rosenbloom, a lawyer for Federated's unsecured creditors,
said this week that he expected the companies to request the filing
extension.
   They filed Chapter 11 reorganization petitions Jan. 15 in
Cincinnati. The petitions listed $7.7 billion in debt, most of it
inherited from when the Toronto-based Campeau Corp. bought Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988 in heavily leveraged transactions.
   Federated and Allied said they still expect to present their
business plans to creditors in October.
   Federated and Allied operate store groups that include
Bloomingdale's, Abraham and Straus, Lazarus, Burdines, Rich's,
Jordan Marsh, The Bon Marche, Stern's and Maas Brothers.

<TEXT>
   The Casino Control Commission on
Friday unanimously approved a restructuring plan for Resorts
International that leaves owner Merv Griffin with just 21.5 percent
of the company and includes a $5 million fund to possibly sue
Donald Trump.
   The commission voted 5-0 for the plan approved early Friday
morning by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rosemary Gambardella. It still
must be approved by the Bahamian government, where Resorts also
runs a casino.
   The plan, filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
gives bondholders holding $911 million in bonds 78.5 percent of the
company and $434 million in new notes.
   It allows Resorts to unload more than half of its massive debt
and bank on a recovery of its fortunes along with Atlantic City's
casino industry.
   Resorts said the plan would take effect in 11 days, with new
notes distributed 10 days later. Griffin also will invest $15
million and another $11 million a year later.
   ``With the plan in place, Resorts will be able to generate
sufficient cash to maintain its operations and service its debt
even if it were to experience no growth in its 1989 adjusted
operating income throughout the five-year forecast period,'' said
acting commission chairwoman Valerie Armstrong.
   ``Accordingly, I believe that Resorts will continue to have
financial stability upon the implementation of the reorganization
plan,'' she said.
   Griffin said afterward that he was relieved and confident
Resorts and Atlantic City would rebound from recent months of flat
growth in a poor economy.
   ``It's a load off,'' Griffin said. ``Now it's up all the way.''
   The plan was filed in December and amended in April to include
the proposed sale of Resorts' Paradise Island operations in the
Bahamas. Resorts officials estimate the Bahamian property could
fetch between $250 million and $300 million. The plan forecasts the
sale by December 1991, two months before Resorts' New Jersey gaming
license comes up for renewal.
   Ms. Armstrong re-emphasized the Bahamian sale remains a key to
the restructuring.
   The revamping also sets aside a $5 million legal kitty to allow
Resorts bondholders to sue Donald Trump, Resorts' former owner.
Bondholders claim Trump left the company insolvent in a 1988 swap
with Griffin in which Trump got the unfinished Taj Mahal Casino
Resort next door.
   Trump has said Griffin is responsible for weighing the company
down with too much debt.
   The plan also features an unusual feature allowing bondholders
to buy units in the kitty to be repaid accordingly if a decision
goes against Trump. Those unit holders would not have to qualify
before the commission, but the kitty's trustee would, the panel
ruled.
   Resorts would have to repurchase the units if litigation does
not settle in a year for at least $3.6 million.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished mixed Friday, as traders
bought after a big sell-off despite soaring oil prices that
heightened inflation fears.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1-16 point, or 63
cents per $1,000 face amount. Its yield rose to 8.93 percent from
8.92 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices had plummeted nearly $15.50 Thursday and yields
finished the week at their highest levels in three months.
   Trading was quiet Friday in the absence of fresh developments in
the Persian Gulf standoff between Iraq and a multinational force
led by the United States.
   But some dealers capitalized on the low prices to buy, said
Bruce R. Lakefield, executive vice president with Shearson Lehman
Goverment Securities Inc. Traders also bought bonds to cover
positions in borrowed securities before the weekend.
   ``It seems that the risk is still for Middle East events to be
bearish but something could happen,'' Lakefield said. ``In the
absence of any events people basically bought back.''
   That occurred despite skyrocketing crude oil and gasoline
prices, which normally trigger fears of inflation and send
investors fleeing from long-term fixed-income investments such as
bonds.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude for September delivery rose $1.27 to $28.63 per barrel. That
compared with about $21 a barrel just before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   Unleaded gasoline finished at the highest level since it began
trading in late 1984 on the Merc. September wholesale unleaded gas
closed up 8.51 cents at 95.97 cents a gallon, giving the fuel a
rise of 16.5 cents on the week.
   Lakefield said that when the market traded lower, ``it tended to
trade down on higher oil prices.''
   Analysts said Thursday's report of sharply higher consumer
prices in July led traders to conclude the Federal Reserve would
not lower interest rates anytime soon to stimulate the economy.
   The market ignored a Commerce Department report Friday showing
the U.S. trade deficit declining to a seven-year low. The figure
that on other days would have been expected to add to the sell-off,
because it indicated economic strength.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to up &lsqb; point, intermediate maturities
were unchanged to up 1-16 point and long-term issues fell about &lsqb;
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.09 to 1,145.41.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.72 percent as the
discount declined 1 basis point to 7.48 percent. Yields on
six-month bills dropped to 7.82 percent as the discount lost 3
basis points to 7.43 percent. Yields on one-year bills dropped to
7.80 percent as the discount fell to 7.29 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7} percent, down from 8&lsqb;
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 90 27-32, down &rsqb; point. The
average yield to maturity rose to 7.49 percent from 7.45 percent
late Thursday.

<HEAD>Labor Board Files Complaint Against Sony; Union Could Be

   The president of Sony Corp. of America
denied Friday that the company tried to influence a union vote by
taking pictures of employees who were unaware their faces would
appear in an anti-union video.
   Sony officials showed the video to employees a day or two before
a vote was taken on whether to oust their union, Local 888 of the
United Food &amp; Commercial Workers International.
   The National Labor Relations Board has filed an unfair labor
practice complaint against Sony in connection with the pictures and
a raffle held the day of the vote.
   Employees in seven New Jersey cities and in New York City voted
in March to dump the union, but the election results could be
tossed out and a new vote ordered if Sony loses the case, said
Michael Lightner, an attorney with the labor board.
   ``Unfair conduct by an employer might be both unlawful and
constitute grounds for a new election,'' Lightner said. ``It's fair
to say that if we win on the unfair labor practice, they'll set
aside the election.''
   Until the case is resolved, the union will remain in power.
   The company did not tell union officials why the pictures were
being taken, which prompted the labor board to file the complaint,
Lightner said. The complaint did not concern the content of the
video.
   Neil Vander Dussen, Sony's president and chief executive
officer, said the union was told only that Sony routinely
photographs its employees for its own use.
   ``Our people just didn't think that it was necessary to go into
great detail,'' he said. ``They were taking them for the video,
yes, but we routinely take pictures of our employees.''
   Vander Dussen said the complaint was based on ``technicalities''
and said that Sony employees clearly wanted the union out. The vote
was 76-44 against the union.
   ``To make an issue out of this is just to delay the
decertification process,'' he said.
   Vander Dussan said Sony will fight the charges. The case must go
to an administrative law judge if facts in the complaint are
disputed. It then goes to a three-member panel of the labor
relations board in Washington.
   An attorney for the local said he would argue that the
anti-union tone of the video gave employees who watched it a false
perception of their co-workers and union sentiment.
   ``It creates the impression that the individuals pictured are in
favor of getting rid of the union,'' said attorney Larry Cary. ``It
also creates the impression that the company is watching you, and
we think that's coercive.''
   A second issue in the complaint filed by the labor board is over
a 27-inch television raffled by Sony on the day of the election.
   Vander Dussen said all employees who voted were entered into the
drawing as a way of ensuring a large turnout and not to induce
employees to vote against the union, as the complaint charges.
   ``If they vote for the union, they're still entered into the
raffle, so I don't see how that makes any sense,'' Vander Dussen
said.

<HEAD>Prime Gets Lower Interest on Major Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NATICK, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. has agreed to
lower the interest on a $500 million loan to Prime Computer Inc. in
exchange for getting a bigger equity stake in the company's owner.
   The loan was secured as part of the $1.3 billion buyout last
year of Prime. The company's new owner became DR Holdings, a unit
of J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a New York investment firm.
   Since then, Prime reported a string of losses and cut more than
2,000 people from its payroll.
   But in its second quarter, Prime reported operating income of
$50.1 on higher revenue of $403.5 million. Prime recently landed
$180 million worth of business as part of an Army contract, said
Joe Gavaghan, a company spokesman. It was the largest contract
Prime has received in its history.
   Under the revised loan terms, Prime will pay a sharply lower
interest rate. Shearson will get an additional 7.5 percent equity
interest in DR Holdings, plus an additional 1 percent of equity for
each quarter that the present loan is outstanding, to a maximum of
25 percent. Shearson already holds a 19 percent stake.
   Prime said the revised financing reflects the company's progress
and ``Shearson's confidence in Prime's long-term potential.''

<HEAD>Settlement Preserves Independence of Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Times Publishing Co. on Friday
settled a complicated stock feud with Texas billionaire Robert M.
Bass which, according to company officials, preserves independent
control of the St. Petersburg Times.
   The Bass group owns 40 percent of the voting stock but gets only
5.7 percent of the dividends of Times Publishing Co. The
partnership had wanted a better return on its investment and
maintained directors had an obligation to recall preferred stock.
   Under the settlement, the company will buy an undisclosed amount
of common shares held by the Bass group and will have the right to
buy more shares from the partnership after three years.
   Times Publishing will redeem or retire all of its non-voting
redeemable preferred stock, as the partnership requested.
   In return, the Bass group is dismissing its suit against the
Times. It agreed not to comment beyond a three-page announcement.
   Andrew Barnes, chairman of Times Publishing, said ``the
agreement assures the long-term independence, journalistic control
and competitive vigor of the St. Petersburg Times, as well as
significant ongoing support for the Poynter Institute.''
   The Poynter Institute controls a majority of the publishing
company's stock and receives 83 percent of the dividends, which are
used to run the non-profit journalism school in St. Petersburg.
   David Bonderman, managing partner for the Poynter-Jamison
Ventures Ltd., said he believes the settlement is in everyone's
best interest.
   ``We always believed this to be a good investment and are happy
we could work with Andy Barnes to help end a family dispute that
has brewed for years,'' he said.
   The Bass group gained a minority stake in the company in
mid-1988. The Times Publishing Co. owns the St. Petersburg Times,
Congressional Quarterly and other magazines. The St. Petersburg
Times is Florida's second-largest newspaper.
   The feud between the sides focused on the company's stock
dividends. The Bass group wanted to change the stock structure to
get a better return on its investment, while the Times defended the
arrangement as beneficial to the journalistic standards of the
newspaper and the health of the Poynter Institute.
   The Bass group had made a $270 million buyout offer for the
Times Publishing Co., but the directors rejected the offer earlier
this year.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Admits No Wrongdoing In Settlement of NLRB Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nordstrom Inc. announced Friday it settled all
its outstanding claims with the National Labor Relations Board, but
a union official demanded the company also admit wrongdoing.
   The Seattle-based retailer signed the agreement Friday stating
it would not punish employees for union activities or offer to
employees benefits that are effective only if the union is ousted,
Nordstrom spokesman Dave Marriott said.
   Nordstrom also will allow pro-union employees the same
privileges as anti-union workers in the matters of distributing
handbills and posting fliers, Marriott said.
   The settlement included a ``non-admission of guilt'' clause,
which NLRB Regional Attorney Walter Mercer said is fairly common.
   But United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1001 will object to
any settlement ``unless Nordstrom admits it has done what they have
been accused of,'' said union President Joe Peterson.
   The union has five days to object after the settlement is
signed, Mercer said.
   Terms of the settlement must be posted for 60 days in the five
Seattle-area stores and one Tacoma store with UFCW Local 367 and
Local 1001 employees, Mercer said.
   Overall, 13 of the 19 charges filed by the UFCW have been
dismissed or withdrawn, said Joe Demarte, Nordstrom vice president
for personnel.
   ``The settlement wipes the slate clean in terms of the unfair
labor practice charges that have been filed by the union,'' Demarte
said.
   He said the settlement was sought because ``we felt it was more
important to reach a settlement of the issues pending before the
NLRB rather than continuing to debate the merits of the union's
allegations.''
   But Peterson believed Nordstrom wanted the settlement so that a
new petition to decertify and oust the union could be circulated.
He said the process cannot begin while charges are pending before
the NLRB.
   The union is in the process of filing new charges against the
retailer, Peterson said. Those charges will involve alleged
discrimination against union negotiators at a store south of
Seattle, Peterson said.
   The union also plans appeals on four other charges the labor
board ruled against, he said.
   Marriott said Nordstrom expected such an action.
   The UFCW represents about 1,500 of Nordstrom's Seattle-area
employees. Nordstrom employs about 30,000 people nationwide inn 60
stores in six states.
   In February, the Washington State Department of Labor and
Industries ruled that Nordstrom had violated state law by failing
to pay some employees for such activities as attending company
meetings, making deliveries and writing customer thank-you notes.
   A union lawsuit seeks back pay for the workers.

<HEAD>Mack Trucks Increases Projected Loss To $180 Million This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mack Trucks Inc. increased its projected
loss for the year by 38 percent Friday, saying questions about the
U.S. economy and the Mideast crisis will cost the company $180
million in 1990.
   If the economic and political uncertainties continue into the
next year, Mack also predicts a difficult 1991, when more stringent
emission standards will increase truck prices.
   The statement said the company now expects sales to total $1.67
billion, compared with the $1.5 billion predicted earlier. Mack
also originally predicted a loss of $130 million.
   In making the original estimates, the company counted on
companies buying trucks in the coming months to avoid the price
increases next year. But no surge has occurred, Mack said.
   Mack cited the overall deteriorating heavy-duty truck market and
continued uncertainty about the economy. The company also cited
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting increase in oil prices.
   The Allentown truck maker lost $97 million for the first half of
the year and went into default on major bank loans. Renault
Vehicules Industriels, which holds a 44.6 percent stake in Mack,
has made a bid to acquire all of the company's stock.

   Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. began raising
wholesale gasoline prices as promised Friday, citing competitive
pressures.
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said it would continue its price freeze
despite a surge in demand that caused pumps to run dry briefly at
about 270 stations as buyers lined up for its lower-priced fuel.
   President Bush appealed for voluntary price restraints last week
after Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait.
   Chicago-based Amoco and Los Angeles-based Unocal were among the
companies that froze gas prices to dealers for a week. They
announced Thursday the freeze would end, blaming competitive
pressures. No Arco-style shortages were reported by either company,
however.
   On Friday, Unocal said it had raised prices by a penny a gallon
in San Diego and San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; Portland and Eugene,
Ore.; Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; and Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.
   Amoco, which sells gas in 30 states, said it raised prices to
dealers by 1 cent per gallon in the St. Louis market; by 2 cents
per gallon in Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit and Minneapolis; and
2{ cents per gallon in Kansas City and Denver.
   ``Amoco's refineries are currently using crude oil received and
priced since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and this gasoline price
increase partially reflects the higher price of that oil,'' Robert
J. Rauscher, Amoco marketing vice president, said in a statement.
   The increases do not directly affect retail gas prices because
federal law requires those to be set independently, but they
generally are passed along to consumers.
   Los Angeles-based Arco has access to ample Alaska oil, which
historically has helped it maintain a low-price marketing strategy
that includes all self-service stations. It has kept its freeze in
effect, although it said it was reviewing the situation daily. It
sells gasoline at 1,500 stations in five Western states.
   An Aug. 10 Lundberg Survey of pump prices found Arco prices 4
cents to 12 cents per gallon cheaper than competitors in the Los
Angeles area. That kind of price disparity has caused sales volume
to surge by 9 percent since Arco announced its freeze on Aug. 8,
spokesman Doug Elmets said.
   That heavy demand coincided with a fire Monday that cut
production of gasoline by 15,000 barrels per day at Arco's refinery
in suburban Carson. That and heavy business at gas stations caused
``sold out'' signs to go up at regular unleaded pumps at the 270
stations, Elmets said.
   Nearly all the stations were in Southern California and the
Phoenix and Las Vegas areas. Elmets said it's taken an average of
2{ hours to replenish regular unleaded gas at the stations.
   He said to ensure an adequate supply to dealers, Arco had taken
the unusual step of purchasing 100,000 barrels of gasoline on the
spot market Wednesday for $1 per gallon, or $4.2 million.
   ``We've hired every common carrier we can find to get gas to our
stations,'' Elmets said. ``We are going to continue to hold the
line as long as we can.''
   A Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane, said Unocal preferred not to
pursue such a strategy.
   ``We certainly don't want to get caught into a shortage
situation by being too far below the market,'' he said, adding:
``We don't want to be too far above, either.''

   Unleaded gasoline hit a record high Friday on
the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday, as crude oil prices shot
up and speculators kept betting that the Middle East standoff would
curtail supplies.
   September wholesale unleaded gas futures soared to as high as
96.25 cents before settling at 95.97 cents per gallon, up 8.5 cents
from Thursday's record close.
   ``They're afraid there's not going to be crude around to make
gasoline with,'' said Ed Kevelson, a broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. ``The entire mood is up. The whole trend is up.''
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, finished up $1.27 at $28.63 per barrel.
   For the week, September crude rose $2.40 per barrel, while
unleaded gasoline was up 16.5 cents a gallon.
   Oil prices have been rising in hectic, rumor-driven trading
since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2, and major
industrialized nations responded by embargoing their oil.
   The tighter supply, combined with the possibility of a broader
Middle East war, has spurred waves of buying by speculators hoping
prices will soar further.
   As prices moved up Friday, ``there wasn't anything to act as a
dampener,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``It's just a real feeling that this
situation is going to last for a while.''
   Prices had fallen slightly early in the week as traders
speculated that diplomats might find a solution to the oil crisis.
But the rally renewed with a vengeance after a meeting Thursday
between President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein _ an ally of Iraq
and the United States _ produced no progress toward a peaceful
settlement.
   Traders were concerned that imports and oil supplies will
tighten, particularly in the Northeast, which is more dependent on
foreign oil than other regions, Hittle said.
   Gas prices get an added boost because U.S. refining capacity
already is tight and most foreign gasoline can't be imported
because it does not meet federal emission standards.
   Among other energy futures, wholesale home heating oil for
September delivery rose to 80.54 cents per gallon, up 5.1 cents for
the day and 7.9 cents for the week.
   September natural gas rose to $1.440 per 1,000 cubic feet from
Thursday's $1.430. On the week natural gas was down 5 cents.
