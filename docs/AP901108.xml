<HEAD>Bush Says US Sending Forces Adequate for Gulf Offensive</HEAD>

   President Bush on Thursday ordered massive
land and sea additions to the U.S. military force in the Persian
Gulf to give ``an adequate offensive option'' if needed to drive
Iraq from Kuwait.
   Bush's order will add more than 150,000 military personnel to
the 230,000 U.S. troops already in the area.
   He ordered troops and tanks transferred from Europe, sent in new
warships and called up combat-ready National Guard units.
   Bush, asked directly whether he was going to war against Saddam
Hussein, said: ``I would like to see a peaceful solution to this
question.''
   ``If this movement of force is what convinces him, so much the
better,'' Bush said. ``Let's hope he comes to his senses,'' he
added.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, giving details of the new
buildup, said it would include two armored divisions and smaller
armored units from Germany and a division from the United States,
the famous ``Big Red One'' First Infantry Division (Mechanized)
based at Fort Riley, Kans.
   Neither he nor Bush would say just how many troops would be
joining the 230,000 U.S. forces already in the gulf area.
   However, full deployment of the units listed by Cheney would add
more than 150,000 troops to the U.S. forces there, Pentagon
officials said in private conversations. Even without sending all
of their support units, the additional combat and essential support
forces total about 100,000.
   Iraq has more than 400,000 troops in the region.
   Cheney said the Navy would send three additional aircraft
carrier battle groups and their escorts, the battleship USS
Missouri and a second Marine amphibious group of 5,000 men.
   And, the defense secretary said, combat-ready National Guard
brigades - the 48th in Georgia, the 155th in Mississippi and the
256th in Louisiana - would be called up for the first time, for
possible reassignment to the Middle East. They total about 10,000
people.
   Also, Cheney said, the Air Force ``probably'' would also send
reinforcements.
   Hundreds of additional tanks will be deployed, the secretary
said.
   ``Whether it will be adequate in the event of going to war with
Saddam Hussein's army, I'm not going to speculate,'' said Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Bush's escalation of the U.S. gulf presence was greeted with
skepticism from congressional Democrats.
   ``I am concerned that the administration is moving to establish
an offensive capacity in advance of a U.N. resolution authorizing
offensive action,'' said Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   Pell said the international trade embargo against Iraq has not
yet had ``a decent chance to produce results.''
   A House Armed Services Committee member, Rep. Ike Skelton,
D-Mo., said Bush's use of the word ``offensive'' was ominous. ``The
whole attitude seems to be changing from defense to offense,'' he
said. ``This is a new chapter.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the Middle East
subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he
believed ``the president has been concerned that the focus has been
drifting away from the military option'' with European political
figures visiting Iraq to negotiate for the release of their
citizens held hostage.
   The president, said Hamilton, ``wants to ... let the Iraqis know
that we're deadly serious about this.''
   The additional troops were ordered as two Marine Corps generals
warned in interviews with The Washington Post that war stockpiles
in Saudi Arabia need strengthening.
   Logistics is ``a concern of all of us because we are ...
stretched farther than we've ever been in our nation's history in
terms of trying to sustain a large force'' in the field, Lt. Gen.
Ernest T. Cook Jr., head of the Combat Development Command, was
quoted in Friday editions as saying.
   A deputy to Cook, Maj. Gen. Matthew P. Caulfield, had similar
comments, and the commandant of the Marine Corps., Gen. Alfred M.
Gray, spoke in the same vein in a speech at Peeksill, N.Y. last
week, the newspaper said.
   Bush spoke as Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in
Moscow consulting senior Soviet officials over Persian Gulf
strategy.
   Soviet officials said they could not rule out the use of force.
Bush called this statement ``very helpful,'' and said, ``We're on
the same wavelength'' with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on goals
in the Middle East.

   The man accused of assassinating Rabbi Meir
Kahane may have been taking prescription drugs for depression,
police said Thursday.
   El Sayyid Nosair, 34, entered no plea Wednesday night at his
arraignment in Bellevue Hospital's intensive care unit. He was shot
in the throat by a U.S. Postal police officer after Kahane,an
anti-Arab extremist, was shot Monday night at a Manhattan hotel.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Thursday that relatives
told police they thought Nosair had been under a doctor's care.
   Nosair was taking Prozac, a drug facing lawsuits that contend it
induces violent and persistent homicidal and suicidal behavior, The
New York Times said in Friday's editions, quoting a law enforcement
official it did not identify.
   The drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Inc., denies any
association between the drug and violence in patients. The Food and
Drug Administration has also found no such association.
   Nosair was on documented sick leave from his job with the city's
Department of General Services five days last week, said department
spokesman John Beckman. The diagnosis was confidential, Beckman
said.
   Investigators have not linked Nosair to any terrorist groups.
   Borrelli speculated that Nosair, a native Egyptian who has an
engineering degree, may have felt frustrated because he couldn't
fulfill his potential in this country.
   Nosair began working for the city in April 1988 on a crew that
tends to heating, air conditioning and ventilation at courthouses.
   In addition, Nosair injured his hand or arm in an accident at
work in which he was nearly electrocuted, Borrelli said.
   The combined stress ``was acting on him; he wasn't getting
ahead,'' Borrelli theorized.
   One source told New York Newsday that Nosair threw a tantrum in
a locker room Monday because he was being transferred to Brooklyn.
But Beckman and Borrelli said they had no indication that was true.
   Beckman confirmed that Nosair was to be transferred, effective
Thursday, from Manhattan to Brooklyn. ``It wasn't punitive,'' said
Beckman. ``He was a satisfactory worker.''
   Beckman said the department has 108 other workers who do the
same job as Nosair. ``These guys take these jobs with the
understanding they will be transferred. Of the 109, last year there
were 61 transfers,'' he said.
   On Wednesday, the Department of General Services suspended him
without pay until further notice, based on his alleged criminal
activity and because he allegedly used a false Brooklyn address.
   Nosair's job has a New York City residency requirement, Nosair
lives in Cliffside Park, N.J., Beckman said.
   Borrelli said police had raised the filed-off serial numbers on
the murder weapon, a .357-caliber revolver. The federal Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is helping to trace it.

   Police are taking teddy bears along
with them on patrol in a western Swedish town, but not for their
own comfort.
   The bears recently began riding in the trunk of patrol cars in
the coastal town of Uddevalla, ready to comfort children involved
in accidents, Sweden's national news agency said Thursday.
   ``We have for a long time been missing something to give
children who have been hurt in one way or another,'' police
assistant Mats Glansberg told a local paper.

<HEAD>EPA Sees No Conflict In Advisors With Tobacco Ties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six scientists on an Environmental Protection
Agency panel on smoking, including its chairman, have ties to a
tobacco industry research group, but the EPA says that's no
problem.
   ``We went to our lawyers and said, `Does this constitute a
conflict of interest?' and they said no,'' said Donald Barnes,
staff director of the EPA's scientific advisory board.
   ``We were concerned about the appearance of conflict of
interest,'' Barnes said. But he said the link between the panel
members and the tobacco organization ``does not cause any question
to be raised about their technical capabilities.''
   The 16-member panel's task is to assure the accuracy and
objectivity of two forthcoming EPA studies on the health effects of
second-hand cigarette smoke. In addition to the six members with
ties to the tobacco research organization, a seventh member of the
panel was appointed at the urging of the Philip Morris tobacco
company, EPA officials said.
   ``They've stacked the deck with people who have close ties to
the tobacco industry,'' said Dr. Alan Blum, a founder of the
anti-smoking group Doctors Ought to Care. ``It's pathetic.''
   The panel members are linked to the Center for Indoor Air
Research of Linthicum, Md.
   The center is financed by Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. and Lorillard Corp., three of the nation's largest tobacco
companies. Its board of directors is made up of employees of those
companies, said Pamela Phillips, an administrator at the center.
   The chairman of the EPA panel, Morton Lippmann of New York
University, is on the science advisory board of the tobacco
industry center.
   Lippmann and another member of the EPA panel, Dr. Jonathan Samet
of the University of New Mexico, helped devise the center's
research agenda.
   Samet and three other members of the panel are listed as ``peer
reviewers'' for the center. They help determine which research
projects the center supports.
   Yet another panel member, Delbert Eatough of Brigham Young
University, receives research funds from the center.
   A seventh member, Geoffrey Kabat of the American Health
Foundation, had been recommended by Philip Morris, EPA officials
said. Kabat said, ``I have no direct contact with the tobacco
industry at all, and I certainly don't see myself as being an agent
of theirs in any respect.''
   The makeup of the EPA panel aroused controversy when it was
reported last month that the agency had dismissed Dr. David Burns
from the panel after the tobacco industry lobbied to get rid of
him.
   Burns, of the University of California, San Diego, was the
author of the U.S. Surgeon General's report on passive smoking and
is regarded by his colleagues as a leading authority on the issue.
He was reinstated to the panel after his dismissal was disclosed.
   Lippmann said he didn't see any problem working with the EPA and
with the tobacco research center.
   ``It can always raise questions,'' he said. ``I don't view it as
any conflict.''
   Samet's office said he was on vacation and couldn't be reached.
   Eatough, who has received research funds from R.J. Reynolds as
well as the Center for Indoor Air Research, said the money does not
compromise his objectivity.
   ``I'm sure that it does raise questions in many people's
minds,'' he said. But he said he is not constrained by the tobacco
research funds. ``What we do is what we do, and we're free to go
down what seem the reasonable roads to go.''
   The scientists serving as peer reviewers for the Center for
Indoor Air Research are Michael Lebowitz of the University of
Arizona, Jan A.J. Stolwijk of Yale University and James E. Woods of
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
   Woods didn't return a call to his office. Lebowitz's office said
he was out of the office until Nov. 16. Stolwijk said, ``I review
grant applications they send me. I don't have anything else to do
with them.''

<HEAD>GOP Loses Ground In Traditionally Democratic Sunbelt</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT McCARTNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats recouped some of their Sunbelt losses
from the Reagan era and took firm control of redistricting as
Southern voters showed they had no love for taxes and no affection
for big spenders.
   Democrats regained the governorships in Florida, Texas and
Oklahoma and won a majority in the Virginia congressional
delegation for the first time in 24 years.
   North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms and Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt,
however, bucked the trend and provided re-election victories for
Republicans in key races. Hunt, the first Republican governor in
Alabama since 1874, won despite a virtual sweep of top state
offices by Democrats.
   On congressional reapportionment, which will draw the lines of
political power for the next decade, Republicans will share control
only in Alabama and South Carolina. Democrats will be in command in
the rest of the region, including Florida, which will gain four
seats in the House of Representatives, and Texas, which will pick
up three.
   ``You have to be careful when you say one party has taken the
torch from the other, but the momentum in the South is clearly with
the Democrats,'' said Del Ali, an analyst with Mason-Dixon Opinion
Research. ``The Democrats have done something they've been unable
to do in 12 years and that is steal an issue from under the
Republicans.''
   Taxes were an issue Republicans had made inroads with in the
South over the past decade, but some Democrat candidates turned the
tables Tuesday.
   Tax increases signed by Republican Florida Gov. Bob Martinez
were blamed for his defeat by former Sen. Lawton Chiles, who
grabbed 56 percent of the vote. Big-spending was another issue:
Chiles imposed a $100 limit on contributions to his campaign and
raised $5.2 million to oust Martinez. Martinez, only the second
Republican governor Florida has had since Reconstruction, raised
$10.6 million.
   Taxes and big spending proved to be key issues in the Texas
race, too. Democrat Ann Richards, the state treasurer best known
for her biting keynote speech at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention, came from behind to defeat millionaire rancher and
oilman Clayton Williams.
   Williams, who spent $8 million of his own money on a $20 million
campaign to keep the governor's office in GOP hands, disclosed in
the final week of the campaign that his tax bill in 1986 was $0. It
was just one of a string of setbacks for the loose-talking
Republican.
   A CBS-TV exit poll said 25 percent of Tuesday's Texas voters
made their choice in those last seven days.
   ``I just would shoot myself in the foot and then I'd load up and
try it again,'' Williams said after his defeat.
   In Oklahoma, David Walters recaptured the governor's office for
the Democrats by easily defeating Republican Bill Price. Walters
has accused Price of oil-price gouging. Price denied that
allegation and filed a libel suit against Walters.
   Georgia Democrat Zell Miller defeated Republican Johnny Isakson
in the governor's race, retaining the office for the Democrats.
Georgia Democrats also threw a scare into Rep. Newt Gingrich, the
fiery second-in-command House GOP leader. Gingrich hung on to
defeat Democrat David Worley in a suburban Atlanta district.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton and Tennessee Gov. Ned McWherter,
both Democrats, and South Carolina Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell
all were re-elected.
   In Senate races, Democratic incumbents Howell Heflin of Alabama,
David Boren of Oklahoma, Al Gore of Tennessee and Jay Rockefeller
of West Virginia won re-election handily, as did Republicans Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Phil
Gramm of Texas.
   Senators David Pryor, D-Ark., Sam Nunn, D-Ga., J. Bennett
Johnston, D-La., Thad Cochran, R-Miss., and John Warner, R-Va.,
were re-elected either in uncontested races or with only
third-party or write-in opposition.
   Helms, the torchbearer of the right wing who had been trailing
in some polls shortly before the election, launched a last-minute
blitz of attack ads against civil rights legislation. His opponent,
former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt, is black.
   Gantt, according to Thad Beyle, a University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill political scientist, ``ran right into the jaws of a
racial campaign.'' Helms won 54 percent of the vote.
   Democratic state Sen. William Jefferson, a Harvard-educated
lawyer, was elected Louisiana's first black congressman since
Reconstruction. Jefferson succeeds retiring U.S. Rep. Lindy Boggs.
   Voters in the nation's capital sent Mayor Marion Barry back to
private life by decisively rejecting his bid for a city council
seat and electing newcomer Sharon Pratt Dixon to succeed him as
mayor.
   Jackson also won his first elected office Tuesday, a nonvoting,
unpaid ``shadow'' Senate seat from which he will attempt to
persuade Congress to make the District of Columbia a state.

<HEAD>Slumping Economy Knocks Out Some Candidates in Recession-Struck
Northeast</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE ESPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The money problems of the recession-struck
Northeast inflicted casualties on both Democrats and Republicans -
not only in Tuesday's elections, but throughout the long political
season.
   Some candidates were knocked out; others were bloodied, even if
they did win. Four incumbent governors lost their seats and five
others were re-elected.
   ``We had a lot of restlessness in the Northeast,'' said Lee
Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``We've had a lot of moving vans come
up and change the occupants of the statehouses. There was major
concern about the economy and state budgets directed at the
occupants.''
   Just the same, voters stopped short of carrying out tax revolts
in Massachusetts and Maryland that would have resulted in the
biggest state rollbacks in history.
   Analysts said they apparently were swayed by slick,
million-dollar campaigns that warned of desperate consequences if
the referendums passed - jobs lost and cuts in education, police
protection and services to the elderly. Instead, voters opted for
political newcomers to carry out a less drastic mandate to hold the
line on spending and taxes.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York was among Tuesday's
survivors. He won a third term, and remains a 1992 presidential
prospect.
   But Cuomo captured 53 percent of the vote against three weak
opponents, well short of the record-setting 65 percent he received
four years ago. He won despite a record $1.8 billion tax increase
and a state credit rating that is the third worst in the nation.
   ``He had a solid victory,'' said Miringoff. ``But to some degree
the same kinds of trends were affecting New York, concern over the
economy and state budgets and a general sense on the part of the
voters that things were going in the wrong direction.''
   Voters in New Jersey, angry over Democratic Gov. Jim Florio's
$2.8 billion tax package, took out their wrath on Sen. Bill
Bradley. Florio was not up for re-election, and at 6-foot-5, the
former New York Knick presented a big target. Bradley received 50
percent of the vote compared to 48 percent for Christine Todd
Whitman, a little-known Republican. He reportedly spent $10.5
million on his campaign, nearly 20 times what Mrs. Whitman spent.
   ``I think Bradley was caught in the restlessness and the
frustration that existed in New Jersey,'' said Miringoff. ``He was
the visible target, sort of the surrogate governor.''
   New governors were elected in Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Vermont and Rhode Island, where budgets and taxes rose by the
billions and workers lost their jobs by the thousands.
   Correctly gauging the mood of the voters, three Democratic
governors - Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, William A. O'Neill of
Connecticut and Madeleine Kunin of Vermont - bowed out of the
primaries.
   In Massachusetts, William Weld, a former assistant U.S. attorney
general, became the first Republican elected to the governorship in
20 years. He narrowly defeated tart-tongued Democrat John Silber,
on leave as president of Boston University.
   Both campaigned as outsiders who would return the state's
economy to good health. Each defeated his party's endorsed
candidate in the primary.
   Weld supported Question 3, a referendum that would have rolled
back taxes and some fees to their 1988 levels, cutting $3.9 billion
from state revenue over the next 18 months. Silber opposed the
measure; the voters backed Weld, but rejected Question 3.
   Paul Watanabe, a political analyst at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston, said the tax-busting referendum was too
drastic. It was defeated because voters guaranteed there would be
substantial change by electing political newcomers in the September
primary, he said.
   Voters rejected caps on property taxes in Anne Arundel and
Baltimore counties in Maryland.
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., former three-term Republican U.S.
senator, won the Connecticut governorship as an independent. He
will be the state's first third-party governor since the Civil War
and its first non-Democratic governor in two decades.
   In Vermont, Republican Richard Snelling, Gov. Kunin's
predecessor, was returned to the office he held 14 years ago,
defeating Democrat Peter Welch, a former state senator.
   Bruce G. Sundlun, a millionaire Democratic businessman, soundly
defeated the incumbent Republican governor in Rhode Island, Edward
D. DiPrete, 74 percent to 26 percent. Sundlun had lost twice before
to DiPrete, who had reversed himself on a pledge of no new taxes.
   ``I think the voters were focusing on the economy in the
Northeast,'' DiPrete said. ``I think they had made up their minds
and that was it.''
   In Maine, the incumbent Republican governor, John R. McKernan,
narrowly won over his predecessor, U.S. Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, a
Democrat. Brennan had campaigned on charges that McKernan failed to
move quickly enough to counter the faltering economy. Brennan
served two four-year terms as governor before changing offices with
McKernan in 1987.
   Govs. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and William D. Schaefer of
Maryland, both Democrats, won re-election easily. Both held the
line on taxes and both states declared budgt surpluses for the
fiscal year ended June 30.
   Another incumbent winner was Republican Gov. Judd Gregg of New
Hampshire, who pledged to keep the state free of income and general
sales taxes.

   Voters delivered a knockout punch to incumbents
in the nation's midsection, ousting four governors and one U.S.
senator - the only senator in the nation to lose a re-election bid.
   Two veteran Democrats and two freshman Republicans were defeated
Tuesday in heated gubernatorial contests. And in a stunning upset
in the Senate, Minnesota GOP incumbent Rudy Boschwitz lost his bid
for a third term.
   In the most tumultuous race, Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich was
narrowly defeated by Republican Arne Carlson, who was a 11th-hour
replacement after the GOP candidate withdrew amid charges of sexual
improprieties.
   In Michigan, two-term Gov. James Blanchard lost by a razor-thin
margin to Republican state Senate Majority Leader John Engler. The
governor is the first Michigan chief executive to be booted from
office in nearly 30 years.
   In two other contests, Republicans blamed for higher taxes lost
bids for second terms. In Kansas, State Treasurer Joan Finney
defeated Gov. Mike Hayden. And in Nebraska, businessman Ben Nelson
eked out a win over Kay Orr, the state's first woman governor.
   Some poliical analysts speculate the gubernatorial losses are
tied to the office itself.
   ``The governors were a lot more vulnerable than legislators,''
said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political science
professor. ``Governors have to deal with the fiscal problems on the
ground. That certainly may mean raising taxes, cutting budgets,
things likely to be unpopular.
   ``Someone like Blanchard over eight years has done a lot of
unpopular things,'' he said. ``Hayden created a number of enemies.
Perpich was seen as flaky and ticked off a variety of people. The
potential to lose is much greater with the governors. You're much
more accountable for your actions.''
   In two of three gubernatorial races in which taxes dominated,
GOP incumbents lost.
   In Kansas, Mrs. Finney, who will became the state's first female
governor, blamed Hayden for high property taxes resulting from
statewide reappraisal and implementation of a classification system
completed in 1989.
   ``It was pretty clearly a vote on Hayden, mostly on the property
tax issue,'' Loomis said.
   ``One thing Finney did really hit on was this kind of prairie
populism that's always here in the Plain states. Rural Kansans,
rural Nebraskans, are normally Republican. They're not that far
from the edge of the economy. When they have economic fears, the
tendency is to move toward populist (ideas).''
   In Nebraska, Mrs. Orr was on the defensive for endorsing a 1987
income tax increase that hit many lower- and middle-income
residents.
   But in Illinois, GOP Secretary of State Jim Edgar won a close
race over Democrat Neil Hartigan even though the Republican
supported an extension of a temporary income tax increase.
   ``I think people like to have a public official who will level
with them before the election and not surprise them after the
election,'' said Edgar, longtime heir-apparent to Gov. James
Thompson, who retired after 14 years.
   Hartigan also was hurt by a low turnout in Chicago, disaffection
among blacks with the Democrats and doubts about his campaign
pledges.
   ``I think Hartigan scored some points on the tax issue ... but
he lost points in other settings among people who simply found his
message lacking in credibility,'' said Jim Nowlan, professor of
public policy at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill. ``They just
couldn't believe Hartigan was going to cut taxes and do all he said
he was going to do.''
   In Ohio, the GOP captured one of its biggest prizes as former
Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich won the gubernatorial race over
state Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr. Democratic Gov.
Richard Celeste was barred by law from seeking a third consecutive
term.
   And in Minnesota, the Republicans added another gubernatorial
seat to their column with Carleson's victory over Perpich, who
sought a fourth term. The GOP state auditor became the Republican
candidate only last week after Jon Grunseth withdrew from the race
amid sexual misconduct charges.
   The Republican turmoil spilled over into the Minnesota Senate
race, in which Boschwitz lost to college professor Paul Wellstone,
a liberal activist who was outspent by a 7-1 margin but captured
voters' attention with clever campaign commercials.
   In two other Senate races, Capitol Hill veterans originally
among the GOP's brightest prospects failed to unseat liberal
Democrats.
   In Illinois, Paul Simon trounced U.S. Rep. Lynn Martin, who
never gained momentum in her campaign. And in Iowa, Tom Harkin
scored a solid win over U.S. Rep Tom Tauke, becoming the first
Democratic senator in the state to win re-election.
   In other contests:
   -Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad swept to a third term over Democrat
Don Avenson, state House speaker.
   -Wisconsin Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson scored a double-digit
win over Assembly Speaker Tom Loftus.
   -South Dakota GOP Gov. Republican George Mickelson handily won
re-election over former state Sen. Bob Samuelson.
   And in the Senate:
   -South Dakota Republican Sen. Larry Pressler won a third term
over businessman Ted Muenster.
   -Indiana's Dan Coats, who inherited Vice President Dan Quayle's
seat, defeated Democratic state Rep. Baron Hill.
   -Michigan Democrat Carl Levin won in a landslide over U.S. Rep.
Bill Schuette.
   -Nebraska Democrat James Exon scored an easy win over former
U.S. Rep. Hal Daub.
   -Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum crushed Democratic challenger
Dick Williams.

<HEAD>Incumbents Survive Anti-Government Sentiment; Environment Measures
Defeated</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

   Western voters voiced anti-government sentiments without kicking
out those in government, approving limits on politicians' terms but
removing few incumbents from office.
   Economic worries, meanwhile, appeared to dull enthusiasm for
sweeping environmental reforms proposed in several states. Voters
rejected most of the measures, including California's closely
watched ``Big Green'' initiative.
   And Republican Pete Wilson's victory over Democrat Dianne
Feinstein in the California governor's race was a bright spot for
the GOP. It will give the party leverage when it comes time to
reapportion the nation's largest congressional delegation.
   Tuesday's election provided plenty of evidence of Western
voters' disillusionment with government.
   Voters in Colorado and California approved limits on how long
politicians can hold office. Arizona voters defeated a proposed pay
raise for legislators by a margin of 2 to 1.
   And in Alaska, Walter Hickel capitalized on an anti-government
mood, winning the governor's race as an independent. The long-time
Republican, elected as Alaska's second governor in 1966, said his
campaign appealed to those fed up with traditional
Democrat-Republican politics.
   ``I think Alaskans just want a change - they want to have more
of a say in government,'' Hickel said. ``It's sort of an
anti-government feeling out there.''
   But when it came time to judge incumbents holding office,
Western voters were kinder, in keeping with a nationwide trend that
returned more than 95 percent of incumbents to Congress.
   Voters supported the five Western governors seeking re-election,
all Democrats. They were Govs. Roy Romer of Colorado, John Waihee
of Hawaii, Cecil Andrus of Idaho, Mike Sullivan of Wyoming, and
acting Nevada Gov. Bob Miller.
   Four U.S. senators seeking re-election coasted to victory: Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Alan Simpson, R-Wyoming;
and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   Even two incumbent senators that appeared vulnerable managed
victories. Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, defeated GOP challenger
Rep. Pat Saiki. And in Oregon, Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield
survived the biggest scare of his Senate career, winning a fifth
term over Democrat Harry Lonsdale.
   In Washington, first-term Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, a Democrat, was
targeted for defeat by the GOP, but weathered a strong challenge by
Republican Bob Williams.
   Why the loyalty to incumbents in a year when people are
supposedly disgusted with Congress?
   ``You can't beat somebody with nothing,'' said Kent Briggs of
the Center for the New West, a Denver-based research group. ``It
may have been in a lot of these races there wasn't a credible
alternative. The anti-incumbency sentiment didn't really get going
until the end of this year, and by that time everyone had filed.''
   Exceptions to the staying power of incumbents were five-term
Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore., who lost to Democrat Mike Kopetski, and
Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., defeated by Democrat Calvin
Dooley. Observers say links to the savings-and-loan scandals
contributed to both losses.
   Wilson's win in California was not the only GOP success. The
party retained two Western seats where its senators were retiring:
Rep. Hank Brown beat Democrat Josie Heath in Colorado, and Rep.
Larry Craig of Idaho won over Democrat Ron Twilegar.
   But Democrats made inroads, too. In Idaho, Democrat Larry
Larocco filled the seat vacated by Craig. And in Utah, the House
seat held by retiring GOP Rep. Howard Nielson went to Democrat Bill
Orton, making it the first time since 1974 that Utah has had more
than one Democrat among its three congressmen.
   Some blamed Republican slides on anti-tax sentiment. But few
voters opted to cut taxes themselves.
   Oregon voters were the exception, passing a measure to phase in
a 1.5 percent property tax ceiling over five years. But Montanans
refused to scrap their state income, property and sales taxes in
favor of a ``transaction charge'' of 1 percent on all financial
dealings. Colorado voters rejected a measure requiring voter
approval for any state or local tax increase. And Utah voters
refused to abolish a state sales tax on food.
   The strongest message among ballot propositions was the defeat
of sweeping environmental reforms.
   California voters rejected, 2 to 1, the closely watched ``Big
Green'' initiative that would have stiffened regulation of air
pollution, pesticides, offshore oil-drilling and logging. They also
rejected ``Forests Forever,'' a proposed limit on clear-cutting of
forests.
   Washington voters defeated a strong growth-control measure, and
Oregon voters rejected strict recycling rules and a proposal to
close the state's only nuclear power plant.
   ``I think concerns on the economy were a factor,'' Briggs said.
``There's a perception out there that the economy is sliding into a
recession. When people are confronted with charges that if we do
something it will cause `X' loss of jobs, it gives them pause.''
   Other highlights in Western races:
   -In Arizona, Republican Fife Symington held a small lead over
Democrat Terry Goddard in a gubernatorial race headed for a runoff.
   Symington led Goddard by about 3,600 votes with 99 percent of
1.04 million votes counted, and about 7,000 votes went to write-in
candidates. A state constitutional amendment requires runoffs in
races in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes, but
no laws are in place to implement a runoff. It could be next spring
before a runoff is completed.
   -Alaskans voted to change the nation's most liberal marijuana
law, making private use of pot a crime again.
   -Oregonians defeated a measure to give tax breaks to parents who
send their children to private schools or teach them at home. They
also rejected, 2 to 1, a restrictive anti-abortion law.
   -Nevada voters approved a measure to protect abortion rights. It
prohibits any change in the state's abortion law except by vote of
the people.

   Rep. Newt Gingrich says he's gotten the
message from Georgia's 6th District voters, who came within a hair
of retiring him from elected office.
   ``It's to pay more attention, to listen more, to reach out to
people more to make sure you're their incumbent,'' the Jonesboro
Republican said Wednesday after complete but unofficial returns
showed him defeating Democrat David Worley by less than 1,000
votes.
   Worley, who won only 41 percent of the vote against Gingrich two
years ago, clearly shocked the House GOP whip, who was so confident
of victory he didn't bother to come home and campaign during the
entire month of October.
   ``There's no question that if I had to do it over again, I would
have flown home more often,'' Gingrich said. ``...But we thought we
were in pretty good shape.''
   Worley didn't even have the formal support of House Democratic
leaders who backed him in 1988, but decided not to this year after
Worley made an issue of Gingrich's support for a $35,000
congressional pay raise.
   ``That was clearly a very negative factor,'' Gingrich said of
the pay raise issue. ``There is no question in my mind that without
that, the race would have been dramatically easier.''
   Gingrich cited three other contributing factors for his close
shave: an anti-incumbency mood among voters, a Democratic tide that
overwhelmed most Republicans in Georgia on Tuesday, and the long,
bitter strike against Eastern Air Lines, the largest employer in
his district.
   Worley, 31, a Jonesboro lawyer, said he intends to demand the
recount that in Georgia is automatic when the difference between
candidates is less than 1 percent.
   ``We had hundreds of grassroots supporters,'' Worley said. ``We
got the right message to the voters that it's time for a change.''
   Roger Ailes, the Republican consultant who managed President
Bush's media campaign in 1988, said voters were angry at Gingrich
for leading the House GOP revolt against President Bush and the
president's deficit reduction agreement.
   But Gingrich said his opposition to the budget agreement and its
tax increases probably saved him from defeat.
   Other GOP political experts agreed.
   ``I don't think Republicans abandoned Newt Gingrich because of
what he did on the budget,'' said Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee.
   Rollins said Gingrich ran into trouble because voters who always
had viewed him as a outsider challenging Georgia's Democratic
establishment began to see him as a congressional insider once he
won election as GOP whip.
   Worley's surprising showing did seem to rejuvenate House
Democrats.
   ``Newt Gingrich now becomes target No. 1 for 1992 if he wins the
recount,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

<HEAD>Conservatives Seek to Boost Support for Bush's Gulf Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of well-known conservatives is taking
out advertisements in major newspapers and on television to drum up
support for President Bush's Persian Gulf policy.
   Sam Zakhem, a former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, said Tuesday
that he and others formed the Coalition for America at Risk to back
Bush's policies.
   The idea for the coalition came two months ago when some
conservatives seemed to waver in their support of Bush's decision
to send 225,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia from Iraq, Zakhem
said in a telephone interview from his Denver home.
   ``Many people run out of patience and this is a very important
thing for the national interest of the United States,'' he said.
   ``Support President Bush and the brave men and women of
Operation Desert Shield working to free Kuwait,'' reads part of a
full-page ad.
   It has appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Times, The Washington Post
and USA Today. A full-page ad in The Washington Post's front
section costs $19,000.
   Zakhem said he informed Bush of the coalition's plan in early
September. White House spokesmen did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking reaction. A recent public opinion poll by
ABC News found about 65 percent of Americans approve of Bush's
handling of the gulf crisis.
   Zakhem said the ads are being paid for by the coalition's
well-heeled backers. But Otalie English, a spokeswoman for Keene
Shirley &amp; Associates, the public relations firm representing the
coalition, said the campaign is supposed to be self-supporting once
it gets off the ground.
   The newspaper ad invites readers to call a toll-free telephone
number for a ``free emergency action kit.''
   English said the kit includes a bumper sticker and several 900
telephone numbers. Callers can - for a fee - receive updates on the
situation in Kuwait and learn to set up a grassroots organizing
campaign, she said.
   The toll-free number has been flooded with requests, Zakhem
said.
   Zakhem said the coalition hopes for a peaceful solution to the
gulf crisis, but he added that question is up to Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   The group includes retired Maj. Gen. John K. Singlaub, who was
involved in sending weapons to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels in the
Reagan administration; David Keene of the American Conservative
Union; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Lewis Tambs, a
former ambassador to Costa Rica; and Doug Wead, who resigned
earlier this year as Bush's liaison to conservative and religious
groups.

<HEAD>GOP Redistricting Survivors: `They'd Have Killed Us'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans may not have won many
redistricting skirmishes, but they feel lucky to merely have
survived Democratic efforts to shut them out of the process in
several key states.
   ``They'd have killed us into the end of the next century,'' said
Bill Stevens, a spokesman for the New York state Senate
Republicans. The GOP repelled Democrats' attempts to take the
chamber in Tuesday's elections.
   ``It's not a game in which gentlemen draw district lines ...
There's no Marquess of Queensberry rules,'' Stevens said. ``That's
not the way it's done.''
   The game was to gain control of the state governments that will
reassign U.S. House seats based on population shifts - a process
that can reshape congressional delegations and legislatures for the
coming decade.
   Democrats racked up big redistricting victories, taking the
governorships in Florida and Texas, which together will gain seven
U.S. House seats, and adding Rhode Island, New Mexico and Oklahoma
to the list of states where they hold a lock on recharting
political lines.
   The GOP won a round by taking the California governor's race,
but that only ensures Republicans negotiating power there because
the state's Legislature is controlled by Democrats.
   Because New York has a Democratic governor and Democratic state
Assembly, the GOP had to have the state Senate to maintain any
bargaining power. Population shifts will cost the state three U.S.
House seats.
   A similar breakdown was at stake in Pennsylvania, which will
lose two House seats, and where the GOP hung onto control of the
state Senate.
   ``If we hadn't held on ... we would have been subject to a
reapportionment steamroller pencil that would have drawn the lines
in a highly partisan manner,'' said Senate President Robert
Jubelirer, who led the Republicans' successful defensive. ``At
least now we are a player at the table.''
   In Florida, Democrats hold all the power because they retrained
slim majorities in the state Senate and House and snatched the
governor's seat as well.
   Florida will gain four U.S. House seats. Allen Stonecipher,
executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, said the
party's monopoly will help Democrats regain the ground they lost in
the 1980s.
   ``After a decade of unadorned Republican economics ... it's
important that Democrats have an opportunity to advance a different
approach to economic and domestic problems,'' he said.
   The states that will gain or lose House seats are most often
thought of as key redistricting states. But all political lines,
such as state legislative district lines, are remapped.
   State control can be equally important. Creative juggling of
district lines - stacking a district with precincts that generally
vote either Republican or Democratic - can oftentimes guarantee
whether a Republican or Democrat will win in that district.
   The process can come in handy when party leaders are looking to
help out a budding young political star. They can redraw a district
that will better position a politician for a run for higher office
down the road.
   The same is true if the party that controls the redistricting
process sees a future threat from a young politician on the other
side.
   ``You can either blunt the other person's talent pool or you can
use redistricting to enhance your own talent pool,'' Stevens said.

<HEAD>NASA to Cut Costs of Space Station Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA is literally going back to the drawing
board to live within its budget and still find a way to build a
space station to put Americans into space permanently.
   ``We have $6 billion more program planned than we have money
for,'' William B. Lenoir, the head of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's space flight program, said Wednesday.
Congress gave the agency three months to revamp a space station
design that was six years in the making.
   ``It is our intention to come back in 90 days with the answers
to what can we do, what makes sense ... and still have a useful,
affordable program,'' Lenoir told reporters. ``If we cannot come up
with what we consider a reasonable program then we would have to
readdress whether we should even go forward with the space
station.''
   The Bush administration had asked Congress to spend $2.51
billion in 1991 to propel the $37 billion space station into the
hardware-building stage. The lawmakers allotted $1.9 billion
instead and told NASA to build the station in smaller steps, each
independent of the other.
   They also squashed NASA plans to increase yearly spending for
the station to $4 billion in 1996, telling the agency it could
count on no more than $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion in any one year.
   NASA had long planned to hold a comprehensive design review
during the last two months of this year, and Lenoir said that
process will go forward, even though the final design will have to
be reduced in scope.
   ``We are not going to start over,'' he said. ``We are going to
use as much of the existing system as possible.'' Some of the
modules may be built half-size to save money, but the whole station
will be designed to accommodate additions later.
   Congress told NASA it should be able to build a ``man-tended''
station with three or four shuttle flights, instead of six.
Man-tended is the term used for periodic visits to the station by
astronauts who fly there on the space shuttle for stays of 16 days.
   Lenoir said plans remain to start construction in the spring of
1995, meaning the station would be ready for work early in 1996.
The revised plan, however, won't permit NASA to have crews aboard
permanently by the end of the decade as had been envisioned.
   A frequent criticism of NASA is that it is building a Cadillac
of a space station with all possible options, when it should be
building a Chevrolet instead.
   Asked about this, Lenoir recalled that Johnny Cash once had a
song called ``One Piece at a Time,'' and said, ``Maybe we are going
to build a Cadillac one piece at a time.''
   Meanwhile Wednesday, NASA announced that it will launch the
shuttle Atlantis on Nov. 15 on a military mission, reportedly
carrying a spy satellite that will gather intelligence information
on the Persian Gulf.
   The mission had been delayed by hydrogen leaks on the shuttle.
   The agency also reported that a special investigative team found
no pattern in a series of accidents on the ground involving shuttle
equipment.

   Enough on the election. Now for a word or two
from the silent majority - the 110 million Americans who didn't
vote.
   ``I never took the time,'' said Melissa Withers, 20, of
Mabelville, Ark., on her way to a babysitting job. ``I'm always,
well, usually, mad when it turns out the way it does. But I've just
never taken the time to go down and register.''
   ``It's just sleazeball A or sleazeball B,'' said civil engineer
Jim Allerton of Seattle, explaining why he didn't vote.
   ``I don't believe in Santa Claus,'' said college student
Jennifer Toledo in Rhode Island. ``I don't believe in the tooth
fairy. I don't believe in politicians.''
   They worry the experts, these non-voters. Proportionately, there
are more of them in America than any other democracy in the world.
There are more in this century than in the last century. There are
more in the 1990s than there were in the 1950s.
   About 64 percent of voting-age Americans didn't vote Tuesday,
according to Curtis Gans, who gathers turnout statistics.
   ABC News surveyed 1,028 likely non-voters. It found their
political views were pretty much like those of everyone else.
   They are concerned about the crisis in the Persian Gulf. They
worry about the economy, drugs, the deficit, taxes.
   Sixty-four percent say they trust the government to do what is
right ``only some of the time.'' Sixty percent say local elected
officials care more about serving special interests than helping
people.
   Gans has been studying them for 15 years as director of the
nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the American Electorate.
   He said people voted in heavier numbers on Tuesday in places
``where there was something important to decide.'' But in places
where the public only saw messages framed by political consultants
and sensed that nothing real was at stake, turnout was down, he
said.
   Gans' conclusion: when serious candidates discuss important
issues, people respond.
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, said
only some of the non-voters are the disenchanted - turned off,
feeling impotent, convinced their vote wouldn't make a difference.
   Others are kept away by procedural barriers - difficulty in
registering or in getting to the polls. Others, especially the
young, simply feel government has no relevance.
   ``Most people in America come close to regarding politics as
very distant from their lives,'' he said. ``It's just not an urgent
matter.''
   The Washington Post commissioned a study of people who haven't
registered and put them into three groups: too busy (young,
educated, somewhat more affluent than the others); too cynical
(middle age and middle class); or physically impaired or illiterate
(older).
   Associated Press reporters across the country talked to
non-voters Tuesday and Wednesday. They fell into all the
categories.
   Turned off was Skyp Krantz, 43, of Dayton, Ohio, a $9,000-a-year
clerk in a record store. ``Why bother?'' he asked. ``No matter who
is voted in, once they are elected they do what they want or worse,
what somebody with a lot of money wants.''
   Unregistered was Jim Madzinski, 28, manager of a Tulsa, Okla.
food service company. ``Honestly, I'm not registered in Oklahoma,''
he said. ``The last thing I want to do is get pulled in for jury
duty.''
   Untouched by it all was college student Kevin Moore, 25, in
Madison, Wis. ``I'm just not interested,'' he said while waiting to
cross a street on his bicycle. ``I don't think anyone running for
office can do anything for me.''
   Kim Cruea, 26, a nanny who cares for four children in
Indianapolis, wasn't registered. But even if she were, she said,
``with all these horrible campaign commercials, I wouldn't know who
to vote for. They make everyone sound so horrible.''
   Hostile was Bert Heacock, 39, a building services manager and
part-time night watchman in Boston. ``They're all back-stabbers,''
he said. ``They need to clean up politics. It's all mudslinging and
cutting each other down.''
   Heacock intends to vote with his feet. He said he's saving his
money for a move to Nova Scotia, Canada.

   The Halloween night rampage in which a homeless
man was slain and nine others were wounded in a frenzy of bats and
cleavers caught the city's attention. But activists say other
assaults on the homeless go virtually unnoticed.
   ``Unfortunately, nobody seems to care,'' said Keith Summa, a
advocate for the homeless.
   As he sees it, every day is a scary Halloween for the homeless,
and the horrors are mostly masked by a society that cares little
about those who have nothing.
   On Halloween, a gang of 18 youths dressed as vampires, the Grim
Reaper and the horror film character ``Jason'' poured across the
footbridge linking Manhattan to Wards Island, in the East River,
where more than 100 men live at a city men's shelter.
   Wielding a meat cleaver, bats and lengths of pipe, they attacked
10 men, using the cleaver to slash the throat of 35-year-old Carlos
Melendez, who died on a deserted path on the wooded island. One
victim was hospitalized for a head injury and eight others were
released after treatment for deep cuts.
   Six people, ages 13 to 23 and from the upper Manhattan housing
projects facing Wards Island, have been arrested and charged with
murder.
   Some residents of the area are afraid of the homeless, claiming
they mug people to get drug money. Others know that the homeless
sometimes are defenseless.
   ``The youths pick on the homeless,'' said project resident
Ronell Bailey. ``They'll kick them, they'll bother them. It's rough
here.''
   Recent studies of the homeless at Wards Island show they also
have other problems.
   The first study of AIDS among homeless in New York City in 1989
found that 105 of 169 men tested at the Wards Island shelter were
infected. That is a rate of 62 percent.
   Earlier this year, a study found that 42.8 percent of the men at
the shelter tested positive for tuberculosis, compared with 5
percent to 15 percent of the general population. Six percent of the
homeless men actually had the disease.
   On Monday, four of the nine men who were injured in the
Halloween attack came to the Coalition for the Homeless, where
Summa works as the advocacy director.
   ``They were looking for some assistance,'' he said. ``There was
a feeling among all four of them that they want justice. They
wanted to make sure the folks were prosecuted and convicted and
that this doesn't happen to somebody else.''
   But increasingly, he said, it does:
   -On Sept. 23, a bat-wielding gang of Brooklyn teen-agers was
blamed for the torching of an abandoned van in which three homeless
people were asleep. Nora Reilly, 25, was burnd over 100 percent of
her body and died. Two men were critically injured.
   -On Sept. 26, a homeless man in his 50s known as Ruben was set
on fire and burned over 85 percent of his body in Queens.
   -In May, a homeless woman died after she was beaten on a
Brooklyn street after someone accused her of stealing a radio.
   -On Nov. 4, 1989, Samuel Jenkins was burned over 30 percent of
his body when a woman set fire to his makeshift shelter in a
Manhattan park. He later died.
   -On Sept. 18, 1988, a homeless man known as Johnny was killed
when a gang of teen-agers chase him onto a busy highway, where he
was struck by a car.
   Summa said about 200 homeless people in New York die on the
streets each year, many victims of the winter cold. Some are
electrocuted when they try to seek refuge in subway stations.
   ``From the information we see, homeless people are much more the
victims of crime than the perpetrators, although I don't think
that's the perception of the general public,'' he said.
   ``Homeless people at this point are not prone to report this
sort of crime because they don't think they'll get justice.''
   Mary Brosnahan, director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said
part of the problem is that the city, through its indifference to
the homeless issue, sends out a message that ``homeless people are
disposable.''
   ``It takes as grisly a crime as this to get people's
attention,'' she said. ``This stuff is on the rise and a lot more
mean spirited. It's alarming.''

   Growing Republican frustration over lopsided
Democratic majorities in the House and Senate hangs over a crucial
GOP meeting that could lead to a shakeup of its congressional
campaign apparatus.
   Republicans yielded at least nine more House seats and a Senate
seat to the Democrats in Tuesday's polling. Top GOP figures said
the party fared better than expected, given the historic mid-term
losses suffered by the party in power in the White House.
   Rep. Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan joined other top Republicans
putting the best face on the GOP's mid-term election performance.
But on the side, Vander Jagt is campaigning quietly for re-election
as chairman of the Republican National Campaign Committee.
   He has held the top RNCC job for 15 years, but the GOP has not
made substantial gains in the House during that time. Some
Republican sources had suggested he might be considering stepping
down, but he said Wednesday he was lining up votes for re-election.
   Party sources have said that Rep. Don Sundquist of Tennessee is
challenging Vander Jagt.
   The climate surrounding that early December organizational
meeting is clouded by another lingering problem - White House
displeasure with Ed Rollins, the RNCC co-chairman and one-time
political director for Ronald Reagan.
   Rollins, who was brought into the campaign committee two years
ago by Vander Jagt, got into hot water for advising Republicans
with tough anti-tax records and pledges to distance themselves from
Bush. His advice came after the president abandoned his
no-new-taxes pledge in the quest for a deficit reduction deal with
majority Democrats.
   Bush's top spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, gave no indication
Wednesday that the Rollins rift with the White House had healed.
   Asked during his daily news briefing if the president wanted
Rollins to stay on at the campaign committee, Fitzwater said, ``Ed
Rollins' situation is up to the committee, and that's for them to
consider.''
   For his part, Rollins said he wasn't about to leave voluntarily.
   ``I made a four-year commitment to Guy Vander Jagt because I
felt it would take four years to change the way we run
congressional campaigns around this country,'' he said.
   He acknowledged that his advice to Republicans about shying away
from Bush was a source of ``irritation'' with the White House but
said he continues to support the president.
   ``I think we probably saved a couple campaigns,'' he said. ``I
didn't in any way, shape or form want to go to war with the White
House, and I certainly don't want to go to war with the White House
in the future.''

   Minnesota's new governor, Arne Carlson,
has a long record of public service and an equally lengthy slate of
political controversy.
   Even the way Carlson won was fraught with upheaval: He lost the
Sept. 11 GOP primary to Jon Grunseth and threatened a few days
later to mount a write-in campaign for the general election but
changed his mind.
   He actually did start a write-in bid when Grunseth became
embroiled in sexual impropriety allegations, and finally was
awarded the ballot spot after Grunseth withdrew nine days before
the election.
   With 98 percent of precincts reporting, Carlson had 808,182
votes, or 50 percent, to 772,543 votes, or 48 percent, for Gov.
Rudy Perpich.
   At his best, Carlson supporters see him as a deep thinker who
cares passionately about public policy.
   ``Arne is a consummate politician,'' said Barbara Carlson, his
first wife. ``It's his vocation, his avocation. He is really
extraordinarily good at what he does. ... The best thing about him
is he is really committed and caring about people and he is
committed to solving problems.''
   But she added, ``He's got a terrible temper. I think his worst
fault is his terrible temper.''
   His critics see Carlson, 56, as a political brawler who shoots
from the hip with reckless abandon.
   His political career began in controversy in 1965, when he
unseated Minneapolis alderman Richard Franson.
   Franson brought an unfair campaign practices suit on the ground
that Carlson mailed out 12,000 documents resembling a county tax
statement containing an accusation that Franson wanted to raise
homeowners' taxes. The election was overturned, but the state
Supreme Court overruled the lower court on a technicality.
   In 1967, Carlson ran a hard-hitting campaign against three-term
Mayor Arthur Naftalin, a former aide to the late Hubert H.
Humphrey. Naftalin narrowly won.
   ``He conducted a campaign that was really quite unfair,'' said
Naftalin, 73. ``Coming out of that 1967 thing, I've never had a
very positive impression of Carlson.''
   Carlson served four terms in the Minnesota House before running
for state auditor in 1978, unseating a maverick Democrat whom he
later called a ``lazy buffoon.'' He was re-elected in 1982 and
1986.
   His moderate stances on many issues and his pro-choice position
on abortion have aroused the ire of conservatives in his own party.
   The second son of Swedish immigrants, Carlson grew up poor in
the Bronx borough of New York City. He won a scholarship to Choate,
a prestigious prep school in Connecticut, graduated from Williams
College in Massachusetts and attended graduate school at the
University of Minnesota.

   From his rural roots in southern Nebraska,
Earl Benjamin ``Ben'' Nelson branched out on a career that led him
to the Statehouse.
   Nelson grew up in the small town of McCook, the son of a lineman
for a power company. He became an attorney specializing in
insurance issues and worked both for a private insurance company
and in state government before deciding to campaign for the
governor's office.
   At 49, he made it. He narrowly defeated Republican Gov. Kay Orr,
but his margin of victory was so slim that the absentee ballots
could force a recount.
   Nelson had thought about the governor's race in 1982 but said he
changed his mind after one of his children's teachers said it might
not be a good time to put his family in the spotlight.
   At the time, Nelson and his second wife, Diane, had been married
two years. Both were widowed and each had two young children.
   ``It just wasn't my time,'' he said.
   Nelson has learned to be patient.
   He had to wait 42 days after the May 15 Democratic gubernatorial
primary before being named the party's nominee in one of the
closest races in Nebraska history. After a recount, the state Board
of Canvassers declared Nelson the nominee by a 42-vote margin over
Bill Hoppner of Lincoln.
   Nelson has said he doesn't believe it's a hindrance that he has
never held an elected office.
   ``It may be an advantage to come in from a business approach,''
he has said.
   But his business ties to First Executive Corp. of California, an
insurance holding company criticized for its involvement in
high-risk securities known as junk bonds, became an issue in the
campaign.
   Nelson, who served on First Executive's board of directors, said
he was not responsible for the company's management and its
investment policy.
   Nelson graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1963, then
received a master's degree in philosophy in 1966.
   He worked for seven years for the Consumer Division of the
Nebraska Insurance Division, eventually becoming supervisor of
compliance and enforcement.
   After he earned a law degree in 1970, he worked for the Central
National Insurance Group of Omaha until 1980, except for two years
when he was state insurance director in then-Gov. Jim Exon's
cabinet.
   He re-entered private law practice in 1981 and in 1982 became
executive vice president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, an organization of state insurance commissioners.
   He joined an Omaha law firm in 1985.

   The elections proved once again that money can
be an unbeatable political asset - but it doesn't guarantee
victory.
   A handful of upsets and surprising turnabouts showed money
sometimes isn't everything when it comes to winning votes.
   While the vast majority of incumbents, with their superior
fund-raising ability, won their races, there were notable
exceptions.
   They were seen in:
   -Minnesota, where Democrat Paul Wellstone beat Republican Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz after Boschwitz spent nearly $5 million to less than
$800,000 by Wellstone entering the home stretch of the campaign.
Wellstone said he won on ``shoe leather power.''
   -Florida, where former Sen. Lawton Chiles ousted Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez after Chiles set a $100-per-donation limit on his own
campaign contributions. Martinez thus had a 2-1 money edge over
Chiles.
   -Kansas, where Democratic challenger Joan Finney beat Gov. Mike
Hayden despite Hayden's spending about $2 million to Finney's
$318,000. The figures reflect their primary and general election
spending as of last week.
   -Oregon, where Democratic Gov.-elect Barbara Roberts raised $1.8
million and beat Republican Attorney General David Frohnmayer, who
raised $3.2 million as of Nov. 1.
   -Nebraska, where Republican Gov. Kay Orr had raised $2.2 million
as of last week but was ousted by Democratic challenger Ben Nelson,
who had raised $1.5 million.
   -Texas, where Democratic gubernatorial contender Ann Richards
eked out a victory over Republican oilman Clayton Williams, despite
Williams' $20.4 million war chest that included $8 million of his
own money. Richards raised just over $11 million.
   Several of the 13 House members who were defeated heavily
outspent their victorious opponents, according to their spending
reports on file with the Federal Election Commission. Among them:
Reps. Bill Grant, R-Fla.; Roy Dyson, D-Md.; John Buechner, R-Mo.;
Doug Walgren, D-Pa.; and Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.
   Despite those exceptions, the general pattern of cash-rich
incumbents hanging on to their seats held true.
   The vast majority of House members were returned to office, with
just 13 of the 406 who sought re-election being defeated. Two
California races remained undecided.
   ``The overwhelming campaign finance advantage held by
congressional incumbents dominated and controlled the races,'' said
Fred Wertheimer, president of the citizens lobby Common Cause.
   In North Carolina, Sen. Jesse Helms used more than $11 million
to turn back a strong challenge by Democrat Harvey Gantt, who had
raised $6 million as of mid-October.
   Money helped some challengers as well.
   In Rhode Island, Republican Gov. Ed DiPrete was outspent 2-1 and
went down in defeat to Democrat Bruce Sundlun.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., fended off a challenge from James
Rappaport, whose campaign war chest included more than $3 million
in personal loans. Kerry, who reported raising more than $5 million
as of mid-October to Rappaport's $3.7 million, said: ``We have
proven that money can't buy you a U.S. Senate seat.''
   The Senate race in New Jersey was noteworthy for Christine
Whitman's strong showing against incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley, despite Bradley's huge spending edge. Bradley spent $12.6
million to her $1 million, according to their campaigns, but beat
her by just two percentage points.
   Similarly, Republican Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia barely hung
on to his seat, although he had raised $1.3 million by mid-October
to $274,000 for Democratic challenger David Worley.
   Such races prove that ``money is not always the price of
admission. Special circumstances mean that voters do what they want
to do,'' said Larry Sabato, professor of government at the
University of Virginia.
   ``Worley had problems with money. He might have been able to
beat Gingrich easily'' with a bigger war chest, said Sabato.
   In California, where the governor's race was the top priority
for both political parties, total spending reached $40 million, but
money was not considered a deciding factor.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson raised about $21 million to Democrat
Dianne Feinstein's $18 million.

<HEAD>Election Fallout: Possible Primary Challenge, Credibility Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The next time President Bush hits the campaign
trail, it will be for himself. And many analysts suggest he can
take little comfort from Tuesday's mid-term election results.
   Bush could even face a primary challenge from within his own
party, with Republicans still splintered after this year's bruising
battle over taxes and the budget.
   But then, it all depends on who's doing the talking.
   ``Let me tell you something. President Bush wasn't on the ballot
yesterday. If he was, he would have won big,'' asserted Charlie
Black, spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
   If either New York Mayor Mario Cuomo or New Jersey Democratic
Sen. Bill Bradley had run against Bush on Tuesday ``they would have
had their clocks cleaned,'' Black said.
   But another Republican, hard-line conservative Richard Viguerie,
saw it differently. ``If he (Bush) had been on the ballot yesterday
against a credible Democrat, he would have suffered a massive
defeat.''
   Bush's only recourse if he wants to be re-elected in 1992,
Viguerie suggested, is to ``clean house, get rid of most of his
Wall Street country club advisers and bring in some conservatives
who are in touch with grassroots America.''
   Even so, most mainstream politicians and analysts seem to agree
that the mid-term elections should not be seen as a referendum on
Bush's presidency. But many say there are lessons in it that will
have a bearing on the 1992 race.
   White House and other GOP strategists clearly are sifting
through the results of the elections as they focus their sights on
1992.
   The most serious problem Bush could face is a primary challenge
from within his own party. With conservatives still angry about
Bush's abandonment of his no-new-taxes pledge, this looms as a real
possibility, many analysts suggest.
   ``I think there is likely to be a primary challenge from the
right,'' said Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute. ``The question is whether it'll be a minor
annoyance like that John Ashbrook provided Nixon in 1972 or more
like what Ronald Reagan provided for (President) Ford in 1976 -
taking him to within an inch of his political life.''
   Republican consultant John Sears, who engineered Reagan's nearly
successful 1976 challenge to Ford, said Bush's main problem now
``is that he's lost some of his credibility in the last month.''
   ``He has got to be sure in the next couple years that, when he
takes a position, he sticks with it,'' Sears said. ``Otherwise,
he'll end 1992 in a bad position. People already don't trust
Congress and they don't want to not trust their president.''
   Lyn Nofziger, another former Reagan aide, blames Bush's switch
on taxes for the losses the party did incur in Congress. ``It means
he's got some fence-mending to do. He can't afford to alienate
people any further. He's got to get hold of things again.''
   The base that elected Bush in 1988 ``is really kind of
shattered,'' Nofziger said.
   Ed Rollins, whom Bush has tried to get fired as co-chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Bush
``obviously has had a little setback in the polls but he's still
the most popular president going into mid-term elections in modern
times.''
   ``I think there's tremendous opportunity to get ready for '92
with strong leadership the next two years,'' said Rollins, whose
memo suggesting House Republicans distance themselves from Bush on
taxes drew presidential ire.
   For the record, the White House was being blase about the
outcome of Tuesday's mid-term elections.
   ``You win some and you lose some. We campaigned hard in Texas
and lost; campaigned hard in California and won. It goes back and
forth,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the one-seat Republican loss in the Senate and
the nine-seat loss in the House means little actual change in
Congress.
   And, he declined to see any message in the election results as a
result of Bush's turnabout on tax increases.
   Still, Fitzwater noted, ``Nobody likes taxes. Generally, it's
better politically to be against taxes ... You don't win points by
raising taxes. That's been clear.''
   There's little doubt that the elections leave Bush in a weakened
position with respect to Congress. But Fitzwater said the veto will
remain a primary legislative tool for the president.
   ``Bush is going to be marginally weaker in Congress,'' said
David Mason, an analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
   And, Mason said, ``If he can't get a more defined message in '92
than he did in this year, he's going to have a problem.''
   ``If we have a recession between now and '92, the economy will
be the overriding issue,'' Mason added - a view echoed by nearly
all analysts.
   Meanwhile, the White House is playing coy on the subject of
Bush's re-election efforts. ``Hasn't declared yet,'' Fitzwater
said. ``Hasn't said.''

   The tempestuous tenure of Vishwanath
Pratap Singh as head of India's first coalition government started
with enormous goodwill, lurched through a series of crises, and
ended in public invective.
   In 11 months as prime minister, Singh found little time to
tackle India's endemic problems: poverty, separatist revolts by
embittered minorities and the people's growing feeling of isolation
from the government.
   Instead, he got bogged down in feuds within his Janata Dal party
and the constant need to appease partners in his unwieldy
coalition.
   Singh's defeat in a confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday
night came amid allegations he had used the age-old divisions in
India, caste and religion, to try to further his own political
interests.
   When Singh and his hurriedly assembled National Front coalition
prevented former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party from
winning November 1989 elections, he was hailed as a crusading angel
out to end patronage and corruption.
   The coalition formed an unlikely government with support from a
right-wing Hindu party and a left-wing group who barely concealed
their antipathy for each other. Singh also had to contend with
feuding within his own party, which was riven by factions and had
at least two other men who fancied the top job.
   Nevertheless, he received a good amount of public support in his
early days in office.
   ``We join the people in extending our good wishes to Mr. V.P.
Singh,'' said a February editorial in the Economic Times. ``He not
only deserves but requires the nation's good wishes in tackling the
tremendous tasks that lie ahead.''
   Just days after Singh took the oath of office on Dec. 2, trouble
brewed in the Moslem-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. Moslem
separatists, escalating their struggle to secede from mostly Hindu
India, kidnapped the daughter of Singh's home minister and launched
a cycle of violent protests and assassinations.
   The government's crackdown on the Kashmiri movement represent
one of the darker spots of Singh's tenure. Kashmir, once India's
showplace for tourists, is now fully in the grip of the separatist
campaign.
   In Punjab state, scene of a lingering rebellion by Sikh
militants, Singh started out promisingly. He made a trip to
Amritsar, the Sikh holy city, within a week of taking office and
waded through crowds of Sikhs in an open jeep, disregarding the
pleas of worried security men.
   Three months later, his party piloted a bill through Parliament
postponing elections in Punjab for six months because of the
violence. Another six-month postponement was sought in October.
   ``There is no difference between this government and Gandhi,'' a
Sikh member of Parliament said at the time.
   This year, the number of killings by Sikh militants in Punjab
has surpassed 2,650, higher than any single year in Gandhi's
five-year tenure.
   Secessionist sentiment has also flared in the northeastern state
of Assam, where belligerent tribes want independence.
   Meanwhile, the national economy is in a woeful condition.
   Gasoline prices have been raised twice this year, inflation is
rampant, and the economic crunch caused by the Persian Gulf crisis
has hit India harder than most other nations.
   Through all of this, Singh waged a running feud with Deputy
Prime Minister Devi Lal, who was accused of exemplifying the
cronyism Singh had vowed to eliminate. Singh forced the issue out
into the open in July by threatening to resign. His party backed
him, and he ousted Devi Lal.
   But within weeks, Singh pushed through what many saw as a
divisive plan to strengthen his power base. He made into law an
affirmative action program that reserved almost half of all
government jobs for lower-caste Hindus.
   At least 150 people committed suicide or died in protests
against the law. Critics said Singh was using it to gain favor
among lower castes, who form a majority of voters among India's 880
million people.
   The Supreme Court temporarily eased the situation by blocking
the job quota plan while it studied its legality.
   But then fundamentalist Hindus, who had been threatening for two
years to build a temple on the site of a mosque in the remote
northern town of Ayodhya, began whipping up Hindu sentiment over
the campaign.
   The issue aggravated tensions between Hindus, who make up 82
percent of India's population, and Moslems, who comprise 12
percent.
   At least 22 Hindus were killed by police in two attempts to
storm the shrine, and Hindu-Moslem riots have claimed the lives of
more than 340 other people in the past two weeks.
   Singh said he would uphold India's tradition of secularism and
prevent Hindus from taking over the mosque. It was a laudable
stand, but critics saw it as an attempt to woo Moslem votes.
   In the end, the 59-year-old Singh was brought down by the
combination of a split in his own party and the withdrawal of
support by the right-wing, Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata
Party.
   Singh has one thing in common with Gandhi, whom he served as
defense and finance minister before their falling-out. Both were
called ``Mr. Clean'' at the start of their terms; both resigned
amid allegations of dirty politicking.
   Of Singh, the Sunday Observer newspaper said last month:
   ``History will remember him as one who willfully sought India's
social dismemberment in the crass pursuit of votes. Nearly a year
after he came to power on the vote of just one-fourth of the
electorate, V.P. Singh has left the economy in tatters and society
in ruins. Is it possible to recall even one laudable step the
government has taken?''

<HEAD>China Signals Return to Normal for Program With United States</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. government program that sends Chinese on
American tours is back in official Chinese favor, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said today, underscoring the much-improved relations of
recent months.
   Though tensions persist, both sides appear determined to stress
pragmatic cooperation and put aside ideological and human rights
issues.
   The Chinese government never formally blocked the U.S.
International Visitor Program, which has given more than 600
selected Chinese a brief taste of U.S. society since 1979.
   But since June 4, 1989, when the Chinese army killed hundreds of
unarmed civilians in crushing a pro-democracy movement, about half
the Chinese invited by the program have begged off, apparently
under official Chinese pressure.
   The West had reacted to the army assault with outrage, imposing
sanctions on China.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sheridan W. Bell said today that Chinese
sources recently informed the embassy that ``the Chinese government
is now encouraging people selected for International Visitor
Program grants to take part in the program.'' There was no official
Chinese notification of the change, he said.
   Bell said it was too soon to see any improvement in the Chinese
acceptance rate, but added, ``We hope this will lead to a full
resumption of the program.
   ``We view this development as a positive step and believe it
reflects a renewed Chinese government realization that such
exchanges are highly beneficial both to the Chinese participants
and to our two nations,'' he said.
   Contacts between the two governments have reached a post-June
1989 high in the past few months as the United States has sought
Chinese cooperation in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China's vote
has been needed on resolutions demanding Iraq withdraw from Kuwait.
   Although China had good relations with Iraq, it has supported
all resolutions so far, earning it reacceptance by Western nations.
   President Bush has helped, opposing moves in Congress to punish
China for its crackdown by withdrawing its most-favored-nation
trade status.
   China has in turn freed more than 800 jailed political activists
over the past year and allowed its most famous dissident, Fang
Lizhi, to leave the country after he spent a year in hiding in the
U.S. Embassy.
   After a one-year halt, China also resumed participation in the
Fulbright program this year. Sixteen American professors were sent
to China to teach and do research, and 16 Chinese professors went
to the United States.
   The International Visitor Program, run by the U.S. Information
Agency at a cost of about $10 million a year, brings about 2,800
people from around the world to the United States annually.
   Program officials began inviting Chinese participants after
U.S.-Chinese relations were established in 1979. Before the June
1989 crackdown, 70 to 80 Chinese were taking part each year.
   The visitors participate in programs related to their fields of
work, touring U.S. schools, businesses, hospitals or government
institutions.

   A voting analyst says turnout in elections
this week appears to be near the 1986 level - the lowest in nearly
half a century.
   Analyst Curtis Gans said Tuesday's turnout was up in 26 states
and the District of Columbia and down in the rest.
   In the 1986 midterm election, 36.4 percent of those eligible to
vote actually went to the polls, the lowest percentage since 1942.
After inspecting returns from all 50 states and the District, Gans
estimated the turnout again was 36.4 percent on Tuesday.
   This year, Maine has the higest turnout at 55.18 percent, Gans
reported, based on nearly complete returns.
   Other states with strong showings for an off-year were Montana
at 54.61 percent, North Dakota, 53.24 percent, and Minnesota at
52.51 percent.
   The biggest gainer was Massachusetts, where a hotly contested
race for governor boosted turnout 11.91 percentage points to 49.32
percent.
   On the other end of the scale, Mississippi managed only 16.9
percent turnout. There, the only statewide contest found Sen. Thad
Cochran unopposed.
   Gans said the 16.9 percent figure was likely to be revised
upward when all ballots are counted, but he could not guess by how
much.
   Tennessee managed only a 22.48 percent turnout, with 22.48
percent in Virginia; 28 percent in South Carolina and 29.03 percent
for West Virginia.
   Biggest declines in turnout from four years ago were in Idaho,
down 14.3 percentage points; Tennessee down 13.7 points and
Mississippi down 11.8 points.
   By party, Democratic turnout declined by 0.45 percentage points
and Republican turnout increased by the same share, according to
Gans, director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study of the
American Electorate.
   The number of voters choosing independent or others jumped 1.77
percentage points, however. The vote for independents was boosted
by the election of independent governors in Alaska and Connecticut
and an independent House member in Vermont.

<HEAD>Infotechnology Seeking Buyers For its Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new heads of Infotechnology Inc., the
troubled parent of Financial News Network and United Press
International, say they will recommend selling the companies'
principal operations.
   Alan J. Hirschfield and Allan R. Tessler, appointed co-chief
executives in a management shakeup on Oct. 24, said Wednesday they
have retained the investment banking firm Wertheim Schroder and Co.
for the purchase negotiations, hoping to conclude sales contracts
by the end of the year.
   ``We believe the prices that FNN and Infotech businesses are
anticipated to command could satisfy the companies' financial
obligations,'' they said in a statement.
   They said they were asking banks and creditors for a 90-day
moratorium on payments. FNN has outstanding about $49.5 million in
bank loan principal and approximately $88 million in equipment
lease obligations. Infotech has outstanding about $20.7 million in
bank loan principal.
   United Press International had already said it was seeking a
buyer, but on Monday the news agency said it would have to
liquidate if members of the Wire Service Guild reject its proposal
to cut wages by 35 percent for 90 days. A similar pay cut for
management staff was announced last week.
   ``As a result of recent contract cancellations and other ongoing
factors, UPI currently has a substantial negative monthly cash
flow,'' Hirschfield and Tessler said Wednesday. ``It has been
necessary to make some painful decisions regarding layoffs and
reduced compensation to continuing employees in order for UPI to
remain in business until suitable purchasers are identified.''
   The news agency has declined to specify how many people are
losing their jobs in the continuing layoffs.
   Financial News Network provides business, sports and market data
to cable systems in the United States and Canada. FNN and
Infotechnology collectively own 51 percent of the Learning Channel,
and Infotechnology also has investments in other media,
communications and biotechnology companies.
   Hirschfield and Tessler, who replaced Earl Brian as the head of
FNN and Infotechnology, said they were ``distressed by many of the
unfounded rumors surrounding current events at the company.''
   ``First and foremost, any and all allegations concerning fraud
or misappropriation of funds at the companies have been, and are
being, taken extremely seriously by the boards of directors and
have been, or are being, thoroughly investigated by the companies'
outside auditors,'' they said.
   ``In addition, the companies are cooperating with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's inquiries that we have previously
disclosed.''
   They said only one case had been found in which company funds
were improperly paid out. ``That incident, previously disclosed by
FNN, involved the receipt by FNN's former chief financial officer
of compensation payments, which were not properly authorized, in
the approximate amount of $795,000.''
   The financial officer, C. Steven Bolen, was fired last month.

<HEAD>Franks Says He Won't Pursue Exclusively Minority Or GOP Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Franks is the first black
Republican elected to the House in 58 years and his political
agenda probably won't appeal to many minorities.
   The 37-year-old real estate developer opposes racial quotas and
he is a fiscal conservative.
   ``From the conservative-liberal perspective, there's a major
difference between me and my future colleagues in the House of
Representatives who are black,'' Franks said following his victory
in Tuesday's election.
   He is an opponent of the 1990 civil rights reform act which was
vetoed by President Bush. The son of a mill worker, Franks won a
scholarship to Yale and worked for two Fortune 500 companies before
starting his own real estate firm.
   Republicans were delighted.
   ``It's a great win,'' said Gary Koops, a spokesman for the
National Republican Congressional Committee. ``Not only have we
held a Republican open seat and elected a strong new congressman
who's a Republican, it also broadens the Republican Party.''
   It was a bright spot amid gloomy news in congressional races.
The GOP lost at least nine House seats.
   Franks defeated liberal Democrat Toby Moffett, a former
four-term congressman seeking to make a political comeback.
   Despite a sometimes chilly reception from local black leaders
and organizations during the campaign, Franks carried the black
precincts of his home city, Waterbury. And he insisted that while
opposed to racial quotas, he is pro-civil rights, ``to the hilt.''
   ``I've had crosses burnt in front of my house when I was nine
years old,'' said Franks, who was born and raised in Waterbury. ``I
had a dead opossum put in my mailbox, which I had the misfortune to
open, with a note saying `You're next.'''
   Still, Franks hardly rivals Jesse Jackson for liberal
credentials that remain popular in the black community.
   ``For some time you have only heard from black Democrats from a
national perspective. Now, for the first time, you will hear from a
black Republican in the House,'' said Franks, an alderman in
Waterbury.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
criticized Franks on the civil rights issue and withheld its
endorsement. And during the campaign, two prominent Waterbury black
leaders - and members of the Republican Party - endorsed Moffett
over Franks. About 4 percent of the population is black in Franks'
congressional district.
   Moffett, 46, congratulated Franks.
   ``Let's understand that he has made history,'' Moffett said.
   Franks becomes the first black from Connecticut ever to sit in
Congress. The last black Republican in the U.S. House was Oscar de
Priest, who represented Illinois from 1929 to 1935. He last won
re-election in 1932.
   The win was a highly sought-after prize that drew more than
$50,000 in national GOP aid, a visit by President Bush to the
district and a reception for the candidate at the White House. When
word came through of Franks' victory, Bush telephoned the winner
with his congratulations.
   With Franks' conservative agenda, national Democrats aren't
concerned that his election will mark the beginning of a drain on
one of their most dependable voting blocs.
   ``I don't expect you'll see minorities flocking to the
Republican Party because of Gary Franks, unless he changes his
philosophy, which I don't expect he'll do,'' said Howard Schloss, a
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Still, Franks doesn't plan to champion a GOP agenda.
   ``My No.1 priority is to serve my constituents,'' Franks said.
   Franks won the seat vacated by Republican Rep. John Rowland, who
lost a gubernatorial bid to independent Lowell Weicker.

<HEAD>Farm Population Dwindles Despite Rural Influx</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban sprawl and long-distance commuting have
helped boost population growth in rural America, but new government
figures show the number of farm people continues to dwindle.
   The farm population dropped by 150,000 to an estimated 4,801,000
in 1989, a decrease described as ``not a statistically significant
difference'' from 1988.
   Last year's farm population was reported at 1.9 percent of the
U.S. total of more than 248.2 million people, the smallest share on
record.
   In 1980, the 6.05 million living on farms represented 2.7
percent of the 221.7 million people in the United States. At the
turn of the century, the 1900 census showed 29.9 million living on
farms, 39.3 percent of the population of 76 million.
   The annual report was released Wednesday by the Census Bureau of
the Commerce Department and the Economic Research Service of the
Agriculture Department.
   Overall, the rural population was estimated at more than 66.2
million, up from just under 64.8 million people in the 1988 survey.
   The rural population includes those in living in the open
countryside and small towns. Large cities and their suburbs, plus
towns of 2,500 or more, are considered urban.
   As used in the report, the farm population consists of those
living on farms in rural areas, but does not include the relatively
few who live on farms in urban areas. A farm is defined as a place
that sold agricultural products worth $1,000 or more in the
previous year.
   The farm population definition is based on residence only. Many
people reside on farms but do no agricultural work, and many
farmers and farm employees do not reside on farms.
   Felicia LeClere of the Economic Research Service, one of the
report's authors, said there were no real surprises in this year's
figures.
   ``The things that have come out have been long-term trends, and
none of them has been surprising,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
   LeClere cautioned that all the figures are subject to revision
when the official 1990 census results are available next year. She
is confident that the annual figures are on track, however.
   Officials have noted the increase in rural population - rising
by 12 million people since 1950 - and point out that urban sprawl
and a willingness of city workers to commute greater distances have
been important factors.
   One possible effect of the 1990 census is a reclassification of
some of these distant areas from rural to urban. That could show up
later as a slowdown in rural growth.
   The report said the largest share of the rural population, about
44 percent, continues to be in the South. That has been the case
since the first U.S. census was taken in 1790.
   ``Although the regional distribution of the rural population
changed only slightly in the last 40 years, the regional
distribution of the farm population shifted markedly,'' the report
said.
   In 1950, one-third of all farm people lived in the Midwest and
slightly more than half in the South.
   ``A rapid decline in the Southern farm population, rather than
growth in the Midwest's farm population, reversed the regional
rankings,'' the report said. ``Half of the total farm population
now lives in the Midwest, and less than a third lives in the
South.''
   Other observations in the report included:
   -Farm people continue to be older than the non-farm population
in general, with a median of 38 years in 1989, compared with 32.5
years for non-farm residents. A median age means half of the people
are older, half younger. Non-farm refers to urban plus rural
non-farm people.
   -Last year 97.4 percent of farm residents were white, and 1.8
percent were black, compared with 84 percent white and 12.5 percent
black in the non-farm population. The remainder were described as
of other races.
   -Only 2.9 percent of the farm residents were of Hispanic origin.
   -Nearly 69 percent of the farm residents 15 years and older were
married and living with spouses in 1989, compared with 55.4 percent
of the non-farm people.

   Pro wrestler Andre the Giant was fined
$100 for doing to a TV cameraman what he does to opponents in the
ring.
   A judge found Andre Roussimoff guilty of criminal mischief for
scuffling with Ben Hildebrandt last year after losing a match. The
7-foot-4, 540-pound wrestler on Tuesday was also ordered to pay
$233 to KCRG-TV to fix the camera.
   The scuffle broke out when Roussimoff, who acted in the movie
``The Princess Bride,'' contended Hildebrandt videotaped the match
without his permission.
   Hildebrandt said he was just shooting crowd scenes when the
wrestler put him in a head lock.
   The judge found Roussimoff innocent of assault, saying the
wrestler didn't mean to harm Hildebrandt.

<TEXT>
   A black sect that won civic honors for renovating
inner-city buildings, fighting drugs and operating businesses under
its charismatic leader built its empire on extortion, firebombings
and murder, prosecutors charged.
   A federal grand jury accused the group's leader, Yahweh ben
Yahweh, and 16 followers of involvement in the slayings of 14
people, including so-called ``white devils'' who were killed to
gain entrance to the sect's inner circle.
   Some victims were decapitated. Others' ears were cut off, U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said.
   Yahweh and several members of the sect were arrested in early
morning raids Wednesday.
   ``Any dissenter was subject to extreme violence, including
murder, to maintain control of the organization,'' Lehtinen said.
The sect also used ``random violence as a ritual membership
initiation rite,'' he said.
   The indictment accuses those named of racketeering, conspiracy
and extortion from 1981 to 1987.
   Yahweh, 55, born Hulon Mitchell Jr., regulated all aspects of
his followers' lives, including when and how they had sex,
sometimes ordering women members to his own bed, Lehtinen said.
   The Yahwehs consider themselves the true chosen people, and
Yahweh ben Yahweh - who claims to be the son of God and whose name
is Hebrew for ``God, son of God'' - had in the past referred to all
whites as devils.
   Recently the Yahwehs, who have claimed about 10,000 members,
diminished their anti-white rhetoric and became known as hard
workers who built a modest empire of 27 small businesses and
properties. Their combined tax value has been assessed at $3
million, but their market value is believed to be more.
   Yahweh was arrested by the FBI in a New Orleans hotel. Three
others were arrested in Lafayette, La. His top aide, Judith Israel,
or Linda Gaines, was taken into custody in Atlanta, and another
arrest was made in Durham, N.C.
   Seven members were arrested at the sect's Temple of Love in
Miami.
   The group's enterprising spirit, strict religious practices,
promotion of family values and strong opposition to drugs drew
praise from local officials.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez recently attended a ribbon-cutting at a
Yahweh store with the sect's leader, who has also received civic
honors for rebuilding the inner city. A proclamation declared Oct.
7 Yahweh ben Yahweh Day in Miami.
   But the indictment said the businesses were built in part by the
threat of violence and by extortion of contributions from reluctant
black neighborhoods. The charges include firebombing homes after
people opposed fund-raising efforts.
   The sect first became widely known in 1986 when it took over a
drug-infested Opa-locka apartment complex, evicting residents and
promising to make it a crack-free haven.
   Two residents who resisted were shot to death, and sect member
Robert Rozier, a former pro football player, was convicted in the
slayings.
   Rozier - who could have faced the electric chair - agreed to
provide much of the evidence against Yahweh in exchange for a
22-year sentence, sect lawyer Ellis Rubin said.
   Most of the slaying victims listed in the indictment were Yawheh
members who left the group or opposed their leader. Some were shot,
others decapitated and some beaten to death.
   Seven white men were killed by those applying to join the
Brotherhood, a secret group within the sect. Yahweh ordered the
ears cut off some victims as proof they were killed, Lehtinen said.
   Rubin, who has accused authorities of persecuting the group,
said he was surprised by Wednesday's raids. He said he told
authorities that sect members would surrender after the
long-expected indictment was handed up.
   In Washington, FBI Director William Sessions denied there was
any harassment or racism involved in the prosecution.
   Rubin said he would appear with Yahweh at a New Orleans hearing
scheduled for Friday. Four of the 17 defendants were still being
sought.

   State Supreme Court Justice Armand Arabian
ran as much as 10 percentage points behind his colleagues on
Election Day, and the only reason he can think of is his name.
   Arabian, an Armenian-American like the man who appointed him,
Gov. George Deukmejian, figured his name must have reminded people
of oil, sheiks and the Middle East conflict, court spokeswoman Lynn
Holton said Wednesday.
   Arabian is little known and his conservative record is similar
to those of four other Deukmejian-appointed justices who also won
new terms Tuesday.
   Their majorities ranged from 66 to 69 percent. Arabian's was 56
percent.

   Voters elected independent governors in
Connecticut and Alaska in a historic warning to Republicans and
Democrats that they aren't the only choices in American politics.
   But experts are saying the winners are not true independents in
that if they hope to get anything done, they won't stay independent
for long.
   In Connecticut, former U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. completed
a political comeback Tuesday with a narrow victory in a three-way
field. In Alaska, former Gov. Walter Hickel was the winner in
another close, three-way race.
   Their victories mean two independent governors will be in office
simultaneously for the first time in U.S. history.
   Both men are former Republicans who left the party after falling
out of favor - Weicker because he was considered too liberal,
Hickel because he was viewed as too conservative. They'll lead
states whose legislatures are still party-controlled.
   Hickel said an anti-government feeling among voters carried him
back into office. ``I think Alaskans just want a change - they want
to have more of a say in government,'' he said.
   Weicker said bypassing party politics will make his state more
efficient.
   ``We didn't ask or bequeath upon any particular party to run our
business for us,'' he said. ``We can run it better than anybody
else can.''
   Weicker's independent attitude surfaced in 1973-74 while serving
on the Senate Watergate Committee. He was one of President Nixon's
most outspoken critics. Later, he also was arrested outside the
South African Embassy in Washington during an anti-apartheid
protest.
   Nixon appointed Hickel interior secretary in 1968 and fired him
in 1970 because of what Hickel says were industry pressures. Hickel
also had written Nixon a letter chiding him for failing to listen
to America's youth protesting the Vietnam War.
   Weicker ran under the banner of A Connecticut Party. Excluding
his running mate, only one legislative candidate joined in - and he
lost.
   Hickel adopted the banner of the Alaska Independence Party, an
established third party that wants to make Alaska an independent
country. It was a move of convenience, since Hickel ignores the
party's independence plank.
   The former GOP mavericks are making history by shunning
major-party affiliation and winning, but it is widely felt they
could not have won without their high name-recognition and their
former major-party ties.
   ``The message is very guarded,'' said William Schneider, a
political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute. ``It
helps if you're a known quantity. For a third party to succeed, a
major party has to split.''
   Experts tended to agree that the independent victories send a
warning to Republicans and Democrats.
   ``These are more than blips,'' said James Reichley, an expert on
party politics with the Brookings Institution. ``They're indicators
that neither of the major parties are attracting voters.''
   In another sign of anger at the two established parties,
socialist candidate Bernard Sanders won Vermont's congressional
seat, defeating Republican and Democratic candidates.
   ``Our small state might go down in history as the leading state
in a political revolution which takes power away from the
multinational corporations and the wealthy and gives it back to the
people,'' Sanders said.
   The independent governors-elect face the prospect of lonely
times in office. Weicker, for example, will be unable to file a
bill without legislative sponsorship.
   Reichley predicted that both would move back into a close, if
not official, relationship with the GOP.
   And as so often happens in politics, a feature that can help a
candidate get elected can often make governing more difficult.
   ``They have no party they can call on, allies who will support
them if they get in trouble,'' Schneider said. ``That's a big
problem. Without a political party, you're on your own. It's sink
or swim.''

   The Magellan spacecraft has found
evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock once inundated more
than half the surface of Venus.
   NASA scientists said they don't yet know if there was one great
outpouring of lava from cracks in Venus or a series of smaller
flows, each hundreds of thousands of square miles, that engulfed
parts of Venus at different times.
   The scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
reported the findings Wednesday.
   Magellan uses radar to make pictures of cloud-covered Venus. The
spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989,
went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally began making
maps and pictures of the planet on Sept. 15.
   Geologist Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist, said he
favors the view that the lava gushed out of cracks called vents in
a global set of eruptions that happened all at once, maybe 400
million years ago.
   Brown University geologist and Magellan scientist Jim Head said,
however, the evidence is incomplete.
   ``There's no question that the vast majority of the surface of
Venus has been formed by lava flows and volcanic activity,'' he
said. ``But the question is, did it all happen catastrophically?''
   The lava covers roughly 60 percent of the planet, according to
Saunders.
   Saunders said he began to suspect Venus was subject to such
catastrophic volcanic activity because Magellan's pictures of Venus
show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than
Earth's moon, and because ``the ones we find are all relatively
fresh.''
   That suggests ``there's a process of very widespread volcanism
that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters - and
everything else,'' he said.
   Saunders said Venus' widespread lava flooding was similar to,
but much larger than, vast lava deposits such as India's Deccan
Traps and the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River basalts.
   The Deccan lava floods happened when Earth's crust split open as
India drifted away from Africa about 66 million years ago, allowing
huge volumes of molten rock to pour onto the landscape.
   The Columbia River basalts, which formed in massive eruptions
roughly 12 million to 20 million years ago, cover much of the
Pacific Northwest east of the Cascade Range.
   Magellan's $744 million map-making mission was suspended Oct. 26
because the sun is lined up almost directly between Venus and the
Earth, impairing communications between controllers and the
spacecraft. The suspension also was meant to allow engineers time
to fix Magellan's wobbling solar power panels.
   NASA hopes to resume mapping Saturday.

<HEAD>Government Throws Out 223 Over-the-Counter Drug Ingredients</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: In 5th graf ``hyoscyamine'' is CQ</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has banned
223 ingredients in over-the-counter drugs on grounds manufacturers
have offered no proof they were effective for problems they were
supposed to treat.
   The ingredients range from pine tar in dandruff fighters to
dehydrated garlic in digestive aids to aspirin in medications for
external use.
   The FDA action Wednesday does not ban the ingredients entirely,
just in certain uses. For example, aspirin may still be used in
products for pain relief taken internally, because it has been
shown to be effective pain reliever.
   The over-the-counter drug industry said most of the ingredients
already had been withdrawn, but some familiar drugstore and
supermarket products will be affected.
   For example, Tegrin Lotion, sold for use against psoriasis, may
no longer contain allantoin. Also Packers shampoo and soap may not
contain pine tar, and Donnagel, used to treat diarrhea, may no
longer include atropine sulfate, hyoscyamine sulfate and
scopolamine hydrobromide.
   The ban becomes effective in six months. The agency said none of
the ingredients posed a safety problem in any of the banned uses.
   The ruling is part of an 18-year-long review of about 300,000
nonprescription products that were on the market when a new took
effect in 1972.
   As part of its effort to complete that review, the agency last
week proposed to ban 111 drug ingredients in over-the-counter diet
products. Most companies have stopped using those ingredients,
industry officials said.
   Manufacturers have been on notice since May that the agency
wanted to ban the list of 223 ingredients, and most have
reformulated their products, said Jack Walden, a spokesman of the
Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association.
   ``Overwhelmingly, this is a housekeeping action,'' he said.
``The industry long ago came into compliance ... It affects
products now on the market very, very little.''

<HEAD>U.S. to Withdraw All Jet Fighters From Philippines Base</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says all U.S. jet fighters based
in the Philippines will be withdrawn by next September.
   The announcement Wednesday came on the eve of a new round of
negotiations on the future of American bases there.
   The 48 aircraft will be removed from Clark Air Base along with
more than 1,800 Air Force personnel, leaving a U.S. military
airlift command unit, training units and special operations forces
at Clark, the Pentagon said. Between 7,500 and 8,000 U.S. Air Force
personnel currently are based at Clark.
   In Manila, Philippine Foreign Secretary Raul S. Manglapus
described the planned pullout as a ``partial victory.''
   ``It's their privilege to withdraw,'' Manglapus said. ``It's
certainly a step forward.'' He did not elaborate.
   Negotiations under way involve the future of Clark and five
other American military facilities in the Philippines.
   A leasing agreement on U.S. use of the installations expires
next September; Manila wants the U.S. military phased out by then,
but the Bush administration has proposed a withdrawal period of 10
or 12 years.

<HEAD>Documents: Late Emperor Said He Went To War Rather Than Face Coup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The late Emperor Hirohito said shortly after World
War II that he had not opposed attacking the United States because
he feared civil war might otherwise break out in Japan, newly
released documents indicate.
   In an eight-hour conversation with aides about his role before
and during the war, Hirohito also rejected the Japanese tradition
that reveres the emperor as a living god, Japanese media reported
on Wednesday, citing the transcript.
   The conversation was held in spring 1946, when Allied occupation
forces were considering whether to charge the emperor with war
crimes. The discussions appear to have been part of preparations by
aides for a possible trial.
   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. said the transcripts were recorded
by Hirenari Terasaki, a former diplomat. Terasaki also translated
for the emperor in some of his meetings with Douglas MacArthur,
supreme commander of the Allies during the postwar occupation of
Japan.
   The broadcasting corporation said that when Terasaki died, the
transcripts of the conversation were given to his daughter, Mariko
Terasaki Miller, who lives in the United States and recently
rediscovered the documents.
   ``If I had tried to veto the beginning of the Pacific War, a
coup d'etat would have occurred, and my trusted aides would have
been killed. My life also could not have been guaranteed,''
Hirohito said. He was referring to fears of an uprising in Japan's
powerful military.
   ``Even if that were acceptable, a violent civil war would have
occurred, resulting in a tragedy several times worse than (World
War II), and leading to circumstances that the war would not have
ended. I believe that Japan would have been destroyed,'' Kyodo News
Service quoted the transcripts as saying.
   He appeared to be referring to the possibility of a civil
conflict between those Japanese who favored going to war and those
who did not.
   Japanese officials met and decided to attack the United States
shortly before the bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.
   The radio network quoted Hirohito as saying he did not halt the
war later because he feared the public might believe the government
had given in to the United States, despite Japan's strong army and
navy.
   Before he died in January 1989, Hirohito made few public
statements about his role during the war. However, he had
consistently said he did not intervene in the war plans because he
could not, as a constitutional monarch, interfere in decisions made
by the government.
   ``To my knowledge, I have not heard him say that (refer to a
possible coup) before,'' said Otis Cary, a professor at Kyoto's
Doshisha University and an acquaintance of the emperor.
   In contrast, Cary said, Hirohito took a strong role in 1936 in
putting down a coup attempt within the army.
   ``But by December 1941, the situation was so tight. The military
had complete hold on the government,'' Cary said in a telephone
interview. ``The emperor just held his peace.''
   The transcript quoted Hirohito as telling the five aides that it
was ``troubling'' for him to be referred to as a living god.
   ``Biologically, I have the same body as ordinary people, so I am
not a god,'' Kyodo quoted the transcripts as saying.
   Although Hirohito is considered to have renounced his divinity
in a New Year's message in 1946, Japanese rightists have maintained
he did not explicitly deny his prewar status as a Shinto God in the
Japanese translation of those remarks. The comments were originally
written in English and probably intended primarily for Western
consumption.
   Critics charge that next week's enthronement ceremonies for
Emperor Akihito, Hirohito's successor, will violate Japan's postwar
constitution by once again linking the emperor with the Shinto
religion. Akihito's formal coronation has been delayed more than a
year by an official period of mourning.

<HEAD>Filmmakers Scrambled For Screenplays During Studio Fire; Guard
Arrested</HEAD>

   The fire that destroyed beloved
movie sets at Universal Studios sent Steven Spielberg and other
filmmakers at one of Hollywood's plushest mogul complexes scurrying
to save precious scripts.
   Police on Wednesday arrested a security guard on suspicion of
torching the studio and tourist attraction. Destroyed sets included
those for ``Dick Tracy,'' the ``Back to the Future'' films and an
unfinished Sylvester Stallone movie, ``Oscar.''
   The blaze on the backlot Tuesday night came within several
hundred yards of the Amblin Entertainment complex, a sprawling and
luxurious Sante Fe-style adobe showpiece where Spielberg, Robert
Zemeckis and other directors work.
   ``If the wind had shifted, we would have been in big trouble
here,'' Amblin spokesman Marvin Levy said. Gusts up to 50 mph
helped spread the fire.
   When homeowners flee flames they grab pets, photo albums and
irreplaceable documents. When filmmakers do it, they take
screenplays, artwork and other creations.
   Spielberg and his staff, along with other filmmmakers, made a
dash through offices before getting out, Levy said. Spielberg
focused his efforts on pre-production work for ``Hook,'' a tale
based on the ``Peter Pan'' character Capt. Hook.
   Dustin Hoffman is slated for the title role, with Robin Williams
scheduled to co-star.
   ``Oscar,'' a 1930s-era gangster comedy featuring Stallone as a
mobster hounded by his father to go straight, had finished filming
for the day before the fire broke out.
   ``We lost the entire set and are going to shut down for a week
to 10 days. We have to build New York Street somewhere,'' said
publicist Spooky Stevens. ``We also lost 21 vintage cars, the
camera equipment, props, every bit of wardrobe.''
   The guard, Michael J. Huston, 40, of Tujunga was booked for
investigation of arson and jailed on $1 million bail.
   ``He was on duty when the fire started and after questioning he
was arrested early today at the studio,'' said sheriff's Deputy
Rich Erickson. ``We won't disclose a possible motive.''
   How the fire was set also was not disclosed.
   Huston had been on the job one month, said Dan Slusser, general
manager of Universal City Studios.
   Bob Gale, writer and producer of the ``Back to the Future''
films, told his assistant at Amblin to collect some artwork and a
computer disk containing script revisions for ``Princess of Mars.''
   Gale lamented the loss of the ``Back to the Future'' sets, where
Michael J. Fox rode a futuristic skateboard. It was one of many
popular stops on the Universal Studios tour.
   ``There's nothing there,'' Gale said. ``I couldn't believe it.
You're just looking at this big expanse of nothing. It was a
shock.''
   Zemeckis, who directed all three ``Back to the Future'' films
and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' heard of the fire as he sat down
for a dinner party.
   ``I called my office and the phone machine was working so I knew
there had to be a pretty good chance the building was OK,'' he
said.
   The studio tour operated despite the damage Wednesday, and
visitors got to see scorched sets from films like ``To Kill a
Mockingbird,'' ``The Sting'' and TV's ``Kojak.''
   ``The show must go on,'' a tour driver said.
   Some visitors said the fire gave the studio, the third most
popular theme park in the nation, added appeal.
   ``We saw all the smoke last night,'' said Chris Bridge,
traveling with his family of four from Australia. ``It was a great
show.''
   Favorite tour attractions survived, including the earthquake
ride, the shark-snapping ``Jaws'' ride and the Bates Motel from
``Psycho.''
   The King Kong exhibit and a burning house were not operating
Wednesday. Officials expected to reopen them this week.
   Damage to the 75-year-old studio was expected to be in the
millions, but no official estimate was given.
   Flames were doused before they could reach vaults that house the
Universal film library.

   The 12th and final U.S. game in the championship
chess match between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov ended in a
draw, leaving the pair tied 6-6 in points as the duel moves to
France for up to 12 more games.
   Each player won one game in New York. The 10 other games,
including Wednesday night's, ended in draws.
   Only once in the previous 33 world championship matches have
there been so many draws in the first 12 games: in 1978, when
Karpov beat Viktor Korchnoi.
   The championship resumes Nov. 24 in Lyons, France. The first
player to gain 12{ points wins the championship and $1.7 million of
a $3 million purse. A win is worth a point, a draw a half-point.
   Grandmaster Patrick Wolff, who did commentary during the match,
said the biggest surprise in the New York portion of the match was
the inconsistency.
   The first five games could be considered the best opening
quintet in world championship history, Wolff said. Games six
through nine were ``terrible,'' and the final three were a slight
improvement, he said.
   Wolff also said chess experts had expected Kasparov, the
defending champion, to take a substantial lead. But Karpov
surprised them.
   ``It's very unclear who's better now. It's getting hot,'' said
international chess master Norman Weinstein.
   Danny Martin, a member of a New York City chess club, said the
draws were expected.
   ``It's what happens when the best play the best,'' he said.
   Chess lovers paid $25 to $100 for tickets to watch the games in
the Hudson Theater or on video monitors in the adjoining Hotel
Macklowe, where grandmasters explained the moves in several
analysis rooms.
   About 500 journalists covered some or all the matches.
   Wednesday's game ended after Kasparov's 37th move.

<TEXT>
   Former Contra rebels and their
supporters have cut off the isolated southeast with roadblocks in a
widening protest, demanding the government deliver the land and
other aid it promised the ex-guerrillas.
   Last week, ex-Contras began erecting blockades on the only road
that connects the southeast with other parts of the country. By
Wednesday, they had gained the support of villagers along the
route.
   The blockades have barred trucks carrying produce, grains, milk
and beef to markets in Juigalpa and Managua, causing mounting
losses to farmers in this rich agricultural and cattle-growing
region.
   At least 20 former guerrillas staged a peaceful occupation
Wednesday of Interior Ministry offices in Juigalpa, the midpoint on
the strategic Rama Road between Managua and the Atlantic coast city
of Bluefields, which is 150 miles east of the capital.
   Riot police ousted the occupiers later in the day.
   But in Bluefields, the city hall, a Roman Catholic church and a
relay station for National Television - occupied non-violently on
Tuesday - remained in control of ex-Contras protesting against
President Violeta Chamorro's administration.
   To publicize their complaints, a group of demobilized rebels
have also occupied Managua's cathedral since Monday.
   The former rebels have erected 14 roadblocks on the Rama Road in
the past week, gaining increasing support from villagers as
displeasure with the six-month-old administration speads
throughout the region.
   The roadblocks reach as far as La Palma, some 75 miles east of
Managua.
   ``We are not Contras, but we support the boys,'' said Efrain
Rodriguez, 45, a farmer from La Palma. ``Violeta has got to deliver
on what she promised. And these piricuacos have got to go.''
   Piricuacos is an Indian word meaning ``curs,'' an insult
opponents throw at the Sandinistas, whom Mrs. Chamorro defeated in
Feb. 25 elections. The Sandinistas, who ruled for 10 years, remain
the country's most powerful political force.
   Former members of the U.S.-backed Contra rebel force that fought
the Sandinistas for nine years are demanding that they be given the
aid promised in exchange for their having disbanded and returned to
civilian life.
   They also want the Sandinista People's Army and the Sandinista
police dissolved.
   In a process that ended in June, About 20,000 rebels accepted
amnesty and turned in their weapons. They were promised land, food,
medicines and materials to build simple homes in the countryside.
   Like the ex-rebels, anti-Sandinista civilians complain of
harassment by police and soldiers, most of whom are Sandinista
sympathizers.
   ``We want to see what the president promised. We want to see the
army changed,'' said Wenceslao Centeno, 19, also of La Palma.
``They (army) threaten us all the time. This is not democracy.''
   Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado on Wednesday invited the mayors
of the blockaded region to meet with him in Managua today to
resolve the crisis.
   Mayors of eight towns in the region are backing the former Conta
fighters. The fact they belong to the 14-party coalition that
helped bring Mrs. Chamorro to power indicates the extent of
discontent with her government.
   Villagers allow only reporters and emergency medical cases to
cross the roadblocks.
   ``We're ready for them to attack,'' said a woman at a roadblock
near La Palma. ``We have no weapons, but we are ready to die. We're
not going to let the government continue ignoring us.''
   An attempt earlier this week to advance the blockade 10 miles
west of La Palma was frustrated when police took over the entrance
to Juigalpa, the most important town in the region.
   Juigalpa riot police showered tear gas on about 200 people
Monday and beat them with nightsticks to disperse the protesters,
who had started pushing large rocks across the highway. Four people
were reported hospitalized with injuries.
   Since then, police and rmy units have set up roadblocks of
their own, at Juigalpa and points west of the city, checking
vehicles for weapons and asking drivers for identification and
their destinations.
   The bishop of Juigalpa, the Rev. Pablo Antonio Vega, led a
candlelight protest march of about 250 people through Juigalpa on
Tuesday night.
   ``I recognize that everything that has been promised has not
been delivered,'' Mrs. Chamorro said in a videotaped message
broadcast on television Tuesday night. ``But I believe they
(Contras) also have to recognize the causes that have prevented''
the fulfillment of the promises.''
   The government is beset by a host of economic and political
problems that threaten the country's stability.
   Mrs. Chamorro announced the formation of a third government
commission aimed at setting up talks with the former rebels.

<HEAD>Official: Imelda Offers Most Of Her Money In Hong Kong Banks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos has agreed to give the
Philippines 60 percent of the money she has in five Hong Kong banks
if the government drops a lawsuit against the former first lady in
California, an official said today.
   David Castro, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, said President Corazon Aquino's administration will
drop the $5 billion suit if its share of the Hong Kong money
exceeds $200 million.
   Mrs. Marcos would admit no guilt to charges of embezzlement.
   If the agreement is carried out, it would be the first known
settlement between the government and the Marcoses.
   Castro's agency has had little success recovering the billions
the government claims Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former
President Ferdinand Marcos, stole during his 20-year
administration.
   Castro told reporters he would leave later in the day for Los
Angeles, where he is to appear in federal court Friday to explain
the planned settlement.
   Mrs. Marcos's lawyer, James P. Linn, spoke of the arrangement in
Los Angeles on Monday.
   Linn and the government's attorneys said they did not know how
much money is in the Hong Kong accounts.
   Writer Reynaldo Fajardo, a confidant of Mrs. Marcos, told
reporters at his own news conference that he witnessed signing of
the agreement in Los Angeles last month.
   Fajardo said the accounts were in Standard Chartered Trustee
Ltd., Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, Wing Lung Bank, Wing Hang Bank
and the Banque de l'Indochine et Suez.
   Castro said the government was prepared only to drop the
California suit and not other legal moves against the Marcoses.
   The Los Angeles suit, filed in 1989, alleges Marcos and his wife
stole $5 billion from the government during their 20 years in
power.
   Castro said settlement would not provide for Mrs. Marcos to
return to the Philippines.
   The Marcoses left the country during the 1986 civilian-military
uprising that toppled the Marcos administration and propelled Mrs.
Aquino to power.
   Marcos died September 1989 in Hawaii. Mrs. Aquino refused to
allow him to be buried in the Philippines and banned his family
from coming home.

   A two-year-old girl was killed and
two people were missing after a ferry caught fire in the southern
Philippines on Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard earlier said 100 people were missing after the
Tandag sank off the coast of Cortes town, about 510 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Danilo Corpuz later said the report
was erroneous and blamed the error on poor communications.
   He said another vessel, the Surigao Del Sur, was actually
involved. He said the 491-ton vessel's engine room caught fire at
about 7 p.m., causing panic among passengers who jumped off the
ship.
   He said the accident occured about 1.5 miles off the coast of
Cortes.
   He said fishing boats and Coast Guard vessels were able to
rescue 145 passengers and 48 crew members before dawn Thursday.
   He said the ferry left the port of Tandag on its way to the
central city of Cebu, about 180 miles northwest.
   Corpuz said the initial radio report to Manila by a remote Coast
Guard station early Thursday indicated 100 out of 130 passengers
were missing.
   He said the confusion was caused by poor communications between
Manila and the Coast Guard station.

   If American crowds have trouble keeping quiet at
tennis matches, it's hard to see chess catching on here as a
spectator sport.
   Chess fans have to sit on their hands. There are no hot dog or
beer vendors. You can't shout ``exd4!'' or ``Bf6!'' And most
matches end in a tie.
   The U.S. Open here two months ago was raucous compared to the
inside of the Hudson Theatre on Wednesday, as titleholder Garry
Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov played to a draw in the last game of
the U.S. half of their world championship chess match.
   Chess folk take their quietness seriously. As they followed Game
12 - watching the players in person and on video screens and
listening to running commentary via headsets - spectators would
occasionally murmur at an audacious move.
   Immediately, their neighbors shushed them and the words
``Silence Please'' flashed on the largest screen.
   For stage presence, Kasparov and Karpov are no John McEnroe and
Jimmy Connors.
   Both players sat at the board, leaning forward, heads in hands.
Kasparov occasionally jiggled his right foot. There was no dialogue
and there were certainly no tantrums. Nobody threw any chess
pieces.
   In a whimsical touch, the stage was flanked by giant cutout
chess pieces that looked like illustrations from Lewis Carroll's
``Through the Looking Glass.''
   Although known for their dislike of one another, the champion
and challenger were polite during the 12 matches in New York.
   Most of the time, the two took turns sitting down. As one
pondered his move, the other would wait offstage.
   Chess does have its share of excitement, though. On Wednesday,
after move number 31, the pace picked up considerably.
   Because of the time rules, Karpov was left with only nine
minutes to make his next nine moves, while Kasparov had 20 minutes
left for the same number of moves. For this, both sat at the table.
   For those fans who can't take the silence, the analysis rooms in
the adjoining Hotel Macklowe offer a diversion. There, the chess
buffs follow the game on monitors while grandmasters provide color
commentary.
   In Lecture Room 5.08, grandmaster Roman Dzindzichashvili was
holding forth energetically.
   ``I think absolutely terrible move by Karpov!'' he said.
``Absolutely terrible!''
   Another kibitzer shouted, ``Do you think he didn't see bishop
E6?''
   ``No, he saw bishop E6,'' Dzindzichashvili said. ``He just
underestimated.''
   Lack of TV coverage of this year's championship is a sore point
for true chess fans. Syndicated columnist Shelby Lyman was host for
the move-by-move coverage of the 1972 championship between Boris
Spassky and Bobby Fischer on PBS.
   ``I have three, four, five people come up to me every day
asking, `Why aren't you on TV?''' Lyman said. ``Some of them are
almost crying.''
   If the United States is not agog with the championship - which
began Oct. 8 and resumes Nov. 24 - the Hotel Macklowe, at least,
was buzzing with nothing else. In lounges and on elevators, people
talked chess in a dozen languages.
   ``It's exciting to be in a chess milieu,'' said Steve Shapiro of
New York. ``When you're playing, you're with a buddy or in a club.
Rarely are you part of a chess scene. There are lots of scenes in
this town, and chess ain't one of them.''
   For their patience and good behavior, the spectators - who paid
from $25 to $100 per ticket to attend Game 12 - were rewarded with
a draw.
   Ever polite, the audience waited a few seconds before
applauding. The players shook hands with each other and with match
officials and withdrew, silently.
   The best-of-24-game match now moves to Lyons, France, tied 6-6
in points.

<HEAD>Abortion: Philosopher Advocates Law Defining Brain-Birth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A philosopher grappling with the morality
of abortion says the beginning of protected human life should be
defined in terms similar to those used in declaring a person
brain-dead.
   The concept is not entirely new, but making it law would be,
Hans-Martin Sass of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics in Washington
told colleagues at a conference here this week.
   His so-called Uniform Determination of Life Protection Act would
permit abortion until the 70th day after conception, when some
normal brain functions begin, Sass said. After the 70th day the
fetus would be a protected human life.
   Brain-death is the legally recognized termination of human life,
defined by cessation of brain activity. Establishing the 10-week
timetable for fetuses would mark the earliest onset of fetal brain
development, or brain-life, Sass said.
   ``The absence of brain-specific cells in early embryonal
development could be understood as the absence of brain-life,''
Sass said. Under those conditions, ``abortion of inanimate life
must be legally protected.''
   Sass is a senior research fellow at the Kennedy Institute and
professor of philosophy at Georgetown University. He also is
co-director of the Center for Medical Ethics in Bocum, Germany.
   He proposed the act at a University of Iowa symposium that ended
Wednesday. About 60 medical, ethics and legal experts from 15
countries attended the four-day symposium examining the question of
when life actually begins.
   ``In strong contrast to the consensus regarding the end of life,
we do not have a uniform understanding regarding the beginning of
human life, which has to be morally recognized and legally
protected,'' Sass said.
   ``For strong moral, as well as cultural, legal and political
reasons, I argue for a Uniform Determination of Life Protection
Act.''
   People would be free to use contraception or have an abortion
within the 70-day timeframe. Abortions are now legal in the United
States through the sixth month of pregnancy, or later if the
woman's health is threatened.

<TEXT>
   Walter Leroy Moody Jr., indicted in the mail-bomb
assassinations of a federal judge and a Savannah alderman, is a
self-employed editor who was convicted in 1972 of possessing a pipe
bomb.
   Moody emerged as a suspect in February, when it was disclosed
that FBI agents searched his home in Rex, a small town rapidly
becoming part of Atlanta's southern suburbs.
   According to his mother, Moody is a ``bookworm.'' An attorney of
his, Michael Ford, says he's a quiet man ``who very much desires to
be left alone.''
   But the quiet man at least twice before has tried to kill
people, prosecutors say. And he has stayed in the news this year in
connection with the bombings, other legal problems and even a plan
to cash in on his misfortune.
   In Florida, Moody was charged in 1983 with three counts of
attempted murder. Prosecutors said he bought insurance policies on
three divers he then tried to kill during a photo project in the
Gulf of Mexico. The case ended in a deadlocked jury.
   Before the indictment on Wednesday, Moody, 56, already was
imprisoned without bond on federal bribery, perjury and
obstruction-of-justice charges stemming from his 1972 case. He is
scheduled to go on trial Nov. 26.
   His 28-year-old wife, Susan, also charged in the
bribery-obstruction indictment, has petitioned for divorce.
   Moody said in court papers filed in March that another man - an
Atlanta paramedic and former private investigator, not publicly
identified - is the person ``probably responsible'' for last
December's mail bombings.
   By July, Moody was outlining plans to cash in on his notoriety
by selling T-shirts and soliciting screenplays. He said proceeds
from T-shirts with logos including ``Moody Motion Pictures'' - a
company that didn't exist - would be used to finance a movie about
his travails.
   Moody also created an Associated Writers Guild, a company put
out of business by the U.S. Postal Service in June for fraudulent
claims.
   A psychiatric evaluation requested by federal prosecutors in
connection with the bribery-perjury case found ``there may be
reasonable cause to believe'' Moody is mentally ill.
   A psychiatrist who treated Moody in the late 1960s described him
as ``the type of individual who could sell you the Brooklyn
Bridge.''
   Moody, a native of Fort Valley in middle Georgia, served two
years in the U.S. Penitentiary in Atlanta after his 1972
conviction.
   Prosecutors contended he planned to send a bomb and an extortion
note demanding $65,000 to a dealer who had repossessed his car. But
the bomb exploded when his then-wife, Hazel, opened the package,
injuring her.
   Moody appealed to vacate his conviction in 1988, contending that
new evidence showed he was innocent. But the appeal was denied the
following June by a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   Six months later, a judge on that court, Robert S. Vance, was
killed when a package bomb exploded in his suburban Birmingham,
Ala., home.
   Vance was not one of the three judges who ruled on Moody's
appeal. But he had served on two court panels that did consider
cases involving Moody: one that rejected his appeal over the
dismissal of a Florida lawsuit and one that heard arguments in
August 1989 on a second appeal.
   Two days after Vance's Dec. 16 assassination, Savannah alderman
and civil rights lawyer Robert Robinson was killed by a bomb at his
law office.
   Along with his history of trouble in the courts, Moody has
something of a legal background. He attended John Marshall Law
School in Chicago for two years in the late 1960s and represented
himself in at least one appeal.

   Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, a
retired pro wrestler, pinned 18-year Mayor Jim Krautkremer at the
ballot box.
   Unofficial results of Tuesday's election showed Ventura elected
mayor with 12,728 votes to 7,390 votes for Krautkremer.
   Ventura, 39, who retired from the ring in 1986, wore a goatee,
earrings and feather boas during his wrestling days. Now
cleanshaven and a more sedate dresser, he got into politics when
this Minneapolis suburb of 50,000 proposed development in a marsh
near his home.
   Campaigning for slow-growth development, expanded recycling and
a two-term limit for city officials, Ventura waged his race for the
four-year office mostly through yard signs. He and Krautkremer
never debated.
   Krautkremer, who advocated more aggressive development, said
before the election that Ventura's only involvement in the
community had been the marsh fight.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Tokyo Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar surged against the Japanese yen today,
while Tokyo share prices plunged for the third consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 129.50 yen, up 1.95 yen from Wednesday's
close of 127.55 yen. It opened at 129.20 yen and ranged between
128.95 yen and 129.70 yen.
   Trading totaled $13.92 billion, up from Wednesday's $12.646
billion.
   The dollar's early strength stemmed from British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's remarks Wednesday that Iraqi troops would be
removed forcefully if they did not withdraw from Kuwait, dealers
said.
   At midmorning, however, market players became uncertain about
the dollar's trend, Bank of Tokyo dealer Naohiko Yasuda said.
   ``Trading became totally directionless today, but the dollar was
no longer in a continuing down-trend,'' Yasuda added.
   He said the dollar was weaker than other major currencies, but
the yen was even weaker, mainly because of political uncertainties
resulting from the government's lack of leadership in deciding
Japan's role in the Middle East.
   Other dealers said growing concern about Mideast tensions,
especially before the three-day weekend in Tokyo, helped spur
buying of the dollar, seen as a safe haven in times of
international crisis.
   Japan's financial markets will be closed Monday for Emperor
Akihito's enthronement.
   Dealers said there also was demand for dollars to pay for oil
purchases. Japan imports virtually almost all of its oil, of which
70 percent comes from the Middle East.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
530.44 points, or 2.26 percent, closing at 22,969.81 after
narrowing its losses by about 100 points in the afternoon.
   The index now has fallen 1,415.52 points, or 5.8 percent, in
three days.
   Volume on the first section amounted to some 360 million shares,
up slightly from Wednesday's 330 million.
   Traders said investors held off buying today because of fears of
war in the Persian Gulf, in addition to discouraging economic
factors including a weaker yen, falling bond prices and the
overnight plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York.
   ``Nobody wanted to buy amid the poor performances in the yen and
the bond prices, especially just ahead of a three-day weekend,''
said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 84.26 points at 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Wednesday's 84.59-point finish. Their yield rose to 7.875
percent from 7.800 percent.

<HEAD>Sexual Activity Jumps Among Teen-age Women in the Eighties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proportion of American teen-age girls and
women having sex climbed in the 1980s, but the pregnancy rate
changed little because of increased use of condoms, a study found.
   ``All the publicity about using condoms has had some impact,''
said Susheela Singh, co-author of the Alan Guttmacher Institute
study released Wednesday.
   The study of sexual behavior from 1982 to 1988 also found one of
every five teen-agers having sex in 1988 used no birth control.
   Among poor teen-agers, one in four failed to use contraceptives
during intercourse and one-third of all young women are still
unprotected from pregnancy the first time they have sex, the study
found.
   The proportion of girls ages 15 to 19 who had sexual intercourse
rose from 47 percent in 1982 to 53 percent in 1988, the study
found. The increase was greatest among whites and in higher-income
families.
   In 1982, the proportion of whites who were sexually active was
45 percent, compared to 52 percent in 1988. The increase among
teen-agers in families with income of more than 200 percent of the
poverty line was from 40 percent to 50 percent.
   ``The levels of sexual activity were already high among
non-white and poor girls,'' Singh said. ``The white and non-poor
are catching up as attitudes change and become more liberal.''
   The study found that 58 percent of the overall sexually active
group reported having intercourse with two or more partners.
   According to the study, 48 percent used a contraceptive method
at first intercourse in 1982, mainly a condom, compared to 65
percent in 1988. Regular condom use jumped 25 percentage points to
47 percent, it said.
   ``Thus male involvement in contraceptive use at first
intercourse increased substantially,'' the study found.
   The study also found that 57 percent of all pregnancies
conceived in 1987 were unintended. While that is about the same as
in 1982, the proportion of unintended pregnancies terminated by
abortion fell, from 54 percent in 1982 to 50 percent in 1987.
   Among teen-agers, there were 127 pregnancies per 1,000 women in
both 1982 and 1988, according to the study.
   The institute's study is based on data released in the spring by
the National Center for Health Statistics. The National Survey of
Family Growth compiled the 1988 data from interviews with 8,450
women; a total of 7,969 women were interviewed in 1982.

<HEAD>Scientists: Comet Dust May Have Seeded Life on Earth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chemical building blocks for life on Earth
may have arrived aboard comet dust, two scientists say.
   The NASA scientists examined a discovery made in Denmark last
year to develop the hypothesis reported in today's issue of the
British journal Nature.
   Kevin Zahnle and David Grinspoon of NASA's Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in California tried to explain the discovery of
ancient soil that contained concentrations of amino acids believed
to have come from outer space.
   Amino acids are vital to life, combining to form proteins and
other organic structures.
   The buried amino acids in Denmark appeared in strata above and
below a layer of the element iridium, which some scientist say
marks the impact of a huge meteorite that killed off the dinosaurs
65 million years ago.
   The scientists who found the amino acids suggested that they had
arrived on the meteorite, an idea that met with some skepticism.
   Zahnle and Grinspoon suggested instead that the meteorite was
only a chunk of a large comet that created a dust cloud rich in
organic molecules.
   Dust from this cloud deposited the amino acids in the soil
before and after the meteorite struck, they propose.
   A similar rain of organic molecules far earlier in the planet's
history could have provided the raw materials for life, Grinspoon
theorized in an interview.

<HEAD>Special Election Considered Boost for De Klerk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk's
National Party easily won a special parliamentary election
considered a referendum on his efforts to end apartheid, results
showed today.
   Residents of the affluent suburb of Randburg, north of
Johannesburg, gave National Party candidate Marthinus Van Schalkwyk
10,882 votes to 1,969 for Leonie Steele of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party.
   Van Schalkwyk had been expected to win in traditionally liberal
Randburg. He replaces the resigning Wynand Malan of the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party. The Democrats did not contest the
seat.
   The larger question was whether South African whites backed de
Klerk's dramatic reforms, such as releasing black leader Nelson
Mandela, legalizing opposition groups and eliminating parts of the
apartheid system of segregation and white dominance.
   The Conservative Party favors strict racial segregation and
considers de Klerk a traitor for attempting to negotiate
power-sharing with the black majority.
   De Klerk said Wednesday's balloting ratified his reforms.
   ``I think the exorbitant claims of support by the Conservative
Party have been disproved,'' the president said Thursday.
   Before the election, the Conservatives predicted they would
receive a substantial shift in support from National Party voters.
Only a small shift occurred.
   In the 1989 general election, 755 Randburg residents supported
the Conservative candidate, compared with some 6,000 for the
National Party candidate and 8,000 for Malan.
   The Conservative vote more than doubled Wednesday, but fell
short of the 12 to 17 percent swing predicted by party leaders.
   Despite the drubbing, Conservative leader Andries Treurnicht
proclaimed victory. He noted the combined National Party-Democratic
Party vote in 1989 exceeded 14,000, while Van Schalkwyk received
less than 11,000 Wednesday.
   Similar results nationwide would give the Conservatives victory
in a whites-only election, he said. The Conservative Party has most
of its support in rural and blue-collar areas.
   Amber Solomon, 19, said she wanted to avoid the Conservative
Party ``at all costs.''
   ``I can't understand how they can still want to racially
discriminate,'' Solomon said after voting. ``The country's going
through a transitional stage, no doubt about it. The Conservative
Party seems to be terrified of that.''
   The National Party now holds 95 elected seats in the dominant
white chamber of Parliament. The Conservative Party has 39 and the
Democrats have 32.
   There also are chambers for Asians and people of mixed race, but
not for the black majority.

   Tom Clancy, an actor and member of folk
music's influential Clancy Brothers, has died of cancer at age 67.
   Clancy died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Cork, his family
said.
   After serving as a radio officer with the Royal Air Force during
World War II, Clancy became an actor.
   He worked with a touring British Shakespearean repertory theater
before moving to New York for Broadway and off-Broadway roles.
Clancy was praised for his work in the plays of Eugene O'Neill.
   It was in New York in 1959 at the beginning of the folk music
boom that the Tom, Paddy, Liam and their friend Tommy Makem formed
their group.
   Bobby Clancy also occasionally sang with the group, which was
considered a major influence on the current folk music revival in
Ireland.
   Clancy continued to act through the height of the Clancys'
singing fame. He appeared in the film ``Airport'' and television
series ``Starsky and Hutch,'' ``Little House on the Prairie'' and
the ``Incredible Hulk.''
   Clancy returned to Ireland five years ago and settled into
semi-retirement in Ring, County Waterford, where Friday's funeral
will be held.
   Clancy was the second in a family of 11 children. His elder
brother, Paddy, was with him when he died. Liam and Bobby Clancy
were expected to cut short a U.S. concert tour to return to Ireland
for the funeral.
   Clancy is survived by his wife Joan and their four daughters.

   Lawrence Durrell, a British author and poet whose
chief work was the four-part ``Alexandria Quartet,'' died at his
home in southern France at age 78.
   The cause of his death was not disclosed.
   Durrell held a number of official and diplomatic posts from 1941
to 1958, a life he spoofed in two novels: ``Esprit de Corps''
(1958) and ``Stiff Upper Lip'' (1959). His 1938 novel ``The Black
Book'' was about decadence.
   ``Alexandria Quartet'' consisted of ``Justine,'' ``Balthazar,''
``Mountolive`` and ``Clea,'' published from 1957 to 1960.
   He also wrote several volumes of poetry.
   Durrell died in Sommieres, where he had lived since 1966.

   The dollar rose against all major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said speculation that Western forces will launch strikes
against Iraqi troops in occupied Kuwait boosted the dollar, which
is considered a safe haven investment in times of trouble.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's statement of
willingness to use force against Iraq and the decision to increase
U.S. troop strength in the Persian Gulf left traders
``uncomfortable'' without dollars in their trading portfolios, a
trader in Frankfurt said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.95 yen to a closing 129.50 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 130.00 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.4960 German marks, up from 1.4820
   -1.2575 Swiss francs, up from 1.2435
   -5.0170 French francs, up from 4.9715

   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9580, compared

   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$386.30 per ounce at midmorning, from $387.25 bid per ounce late

   In Zurich, the bid price was $386.20, down from $386.75 late

   Iraq's interior minister said today that
the multinational forces in Saudi Arabia will all be targeted by
Iraq's forces if U.S. troops initiate an attack from Saudi soil,
the official Iraqi News Agency said.
   The minister, Latif Nassayif Jassim, was reacting to the new
Saudi-U.S. agreement on the command structure for joint military
action.
   The agency quoted him as saying:
   ``We will retaliate on any American aggression against Iraq, and
all the allies of the American forces in Saudi Arabia will be our
target.''
   More than 300,000 troops have massed in the kingdom to stand up
to Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. They include some
230,000 Americans.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reached agreement with
Saudi leaders earlier this week that in the event of military
action against Iraq, U.S. officers would command their own troops.
   A joint U.S.-Saudi command would be retained in the event of an
Iraqi incursion into the kingdom.
   ``This agreement confirms the plot which we warned of before,
the real agressive and imperialist aims of the American and Western
presence in Saudi Arabia, and exposes Saudi Arabian-American claims
and lies that Iraq is threatening Saudi Arabia,'' Jassim was quoted
as saying.
   ``We repeated many times that there are no Iraqi threats to
Saudi Arabia.'' Jassim said that if an attack is launched on Iraqi
forces from Saudi Arabia ``We will make all Saudi lands where these
foreign forces are now stationed a battlefield,'' INA reported.

<HEAD>Lemuel Boulware, Developer of `Boulwarism' Bargaining Technique,
Dead at 95</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lemuel Ricketts Boulware, who devised
management's one-offer formula for labor negotiations that became
widely known as ``Boulwarism,'' has died at age 95.
   Boulware died Wednesday at his home in Delray Beach, Fla., the
General Electric Co. reported.
   Boulware took charge of employee relations for G.E. in 1947, a
year after the company had gone through a devastating strike.
   He quickly developed what became known as Boulwarism, a practice
he said was designed to improve labor-management relations by
showing employees that the company wanted to do what was right
voluntarily.
   Under Boulwarism, G.E. would listen to union demands, compare
wages and benefits at other companies and make an offer from which
it would not budge during further negotiations.
   The policy flowered in the 1950s and '60s, but fell out of favor
after G.E. was hit with a nationwide strike in 1969 and several
court rulings that went against Boulwarism.
   Boulware, who retired from G.E. in 1961, graduated from the
University of Wisconsin in 1916, and later served as an infantry
captain in World War I.
   He also taught accounting and commercial law at the University
of Wisconsin, Florida Atlantic University and the Plymouth
Institute night school in New York.
   He also wrote the books ``The Truth About Boulwarism'' and
``What You Can Do About Inflation, Unemployment, Productivity,
Profit and Collective Bargaining.''
   His wife, Norma, died in 1987, and there are no immediate
survivors.

   Their grandfather, Mathias Pepersack, was the first Maryland

<TEXT>
   Entomologists say they want endangered
species protection for a recently rediscovered butterfly that
experts believed had been extinct for more than 50 years.
   Paul Hammond, an Oregon State University entomologist and
butterfly expert, said he rediscovered the butterflies by accident.
   ``In the spring of 1989 I hiked out onto a south-facing slope of
a hill that had native prairie on it, and here was this very
unusual kind of lupine plant with all these little blue butterflies
swimming around on it.
   ``I knew immediately what it was,'' he said.
   It was Fender's blue butterfly, a relic of the ice ages found
only in Oregon's Willamette Valley. The butterfly was last seen
near the small town of Wren, west of Corvallis, in 1937.
   Since that find last year, several pockets of the species have
been found in western Oregon.
   A petition is being prepared to ask the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
to declare the butterfly a threatened species under the federal
Endangered Species Act.
   Hammond said the butterfly has a wingspan of only about 1 inch.
The male is a ``brilliant, iridescent blue,'' he said. ``They
really stand out. The female is a drab brown.''
   The butterfly dates back more than 10,000 years, Hammond said.
Surrounded by glaciers to the north and mountains to the south,
east and west, the butterfly's habitat was limited to a small area
of the Willamette Valley.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Egyptian-born American who allegedly
killed militant Rabbi Meir Kahane was described by his father in
interviews published today as a caring son who shied away from
politics.
   ``I can't imagine he did that,'' said Abdel-Aziz Nosair, whose
son el-Sayyid A. Nosair was charged with murder following Tuesday's
assassination in a New York hotel.
   Cairo's three major government-owned newspapers today published
interviews with the elder Nosair in his home at Port Fouad, across
the northern tip of the Suez Canal from Port Said.
   The son, identified by authorities in the United States as a
native of Port Said who immigrated from Egypt in 1981, took U.S.
citizenship last year. He was seriously wounded after the Kahane
shooting when he exchanged gunfire with a U.S. Post Office
policeman, who also was wounded.
   On Wednesday, as police from Egypt's Interior Ministry stood
guard at the Nosair house in Port Fouad, the ministry in Cairo
denied that the Kahane assassin was Egyptian. Ministry officers
said a check of records in Port Said turned up no one with his
name.
   Abdel-Aziz Nosair told the newspaper Al-Akhbar that a day after
Kahane's slaying, government intelligence had summoned him to ask
about his son.
   He said he was asked ``whether I had heard from him recently and
whether any family members were even remotely connected to any
political activites.''
   The questioners never indicated why they were interrogating him,
Nosair said. He said he later read in newspapers that his son was a
suspect in the assassination.
   The newspaper said Nosair chain-smoked cigarettes nervously as
he and another son, Ahmed, talked with Al-Akhbar.
   Attempts today to contact the family in Port Fouad were
unsuccessful. Journalists said government security agents had
ordered family members not to talk after they met with local
reporters.
   In the Al-Akhbar interview, the reporter asked Nosair his
feelings about Kahane, a U.S.-born Israeli who rejected his
American citizenship to serve in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
Kahane was a founder of the Jewish Defense League and advocated
deporting Arabs from Israel and the occupied territories.
   ``From what I read, he was strongly fanatical against all
Arabs,'' the elder Nosair said. ``No doubt what happened to him is
God's vengeance. I can't really describe my feelings now.''
   Nosair said he was certain his son had no links with Palestinian
groups and that he was never politically active. But he said:
   ``I believe his Egyptian and Arab friends (in the United
States), with their feelings that America is biased toward Israel,
may have led him to commit this act against a leading Jewish
extremist.''
   The suspect in the Kahane killing had worked for the last two
years for the New York City Department of General Serivces as an
airconditioning and heating maintenance man. He lived in Cliffside
Park, N.J., where his neighbors described him as quiet and devoutly
Moslem man. He married an American woman who converted. From all
accounts, he was not politically active.
   Al-Ahram, the only Egyptian daily with greater circulation than
Al-Akhbar, played down Nosair's Egyptian background.
   It carried only a brief statement from his father on the
suspect's education and what is described as his apolitical life.

   Firefighters partially contained a
wind-whipped brushfire that has blackened at least 7,000 acres on a
Marine Corps base after temporarily halting train service and
closing Interstate 5.
   Cpl. Lamont Peabody, a Camp Pendleton spokesman, said early
today that the 2-day-old fire was 50 percent to 70 percent
contained. No injuries have been reported, and the only damage
found was slight singeing of structures at the Border Patrol
checkpoint on I-5.
   ``The fire is burning in direction they want it to, toward the
southeast and toward the fire breaks,'' Peabody said.
   Fire officials on the lines haven't indicated when they expect
to have the fire under control, Peabody said. It broke out Tuesday
night in the northern part of the sprawling base; the cause has not
been determined.
   About 500 firefighters from San Diego and Orange counties and
Camp Pendleton were fighting the blaze, aided by aircraft dropping
fire retardants and water, said base spokeswoman Capt. Rose Ann
Sgrignoli.
   About 20 miles of I-5 between Oceanside and the Orange County
line was closed for much of Wednesday when high Santa Ana winds
caused flames to jump the freeway and set the median on fire. The
Pacific Railway line that parallels I-5 also was ordered shut down
for about nine hours Wednesday.
   The fire initially forced the temporary evacuation of about 300
trailer park residents and a dozen workers at the San Onofre
Nuclear Power Plant.
   Southern California Edison Co. spokesman David Barron said the
fire had threatened nuclear power plant buildings on the east side
of I-5 as well as the facility's three generators west of the
freeway, but none was damaged.

<TEXT>
   American and Philippine officials
reported progress today in talks on the future of U.S. military
bases after Washington agreed to remove all combat planes from the
Philippines.
   In a joint statement, the two sides said they discussed security
issues related to the bases but gave no details. ``Progress was so
great that the panels will be working into the evening hours,'' the
statement said.
   On Wednesday, U.S. special negotiator Richard Armitage told
Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus that Washington would remove its
48 combat aircraft along with more than 1,800 Air Force personnel
from Clark Air Base, one of six installations in the Phillipines.
   Manglapus has said the Philippines wants to take control of
Clark when the current bases agreement expires in September 1991.
The status of the Subic Bay naval base and the other installations
are subject to negotiation.
   The bases are technically Philippine property but are
effectively under American control. They are among the oldest and
largest U.S. installations on foreign soil.
   The Manila Times reported today that the Philippines had drawn
up a 154-page draft agreement allowing the Americans continued use
of key facilities at the bases for a limited period after September
1991.
   In return, the Philippines wants preferential trade agreements,
duty free access to U.S. markets for selected goods, guaranteed
purchases of Philippine sugar, unspecified loans from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank, debt relief, increased investments and other
economic concessions, the newspapers said.
   As the talks resumed, a dispute emerged within the Philippine
government over its negotiating tactics.
   On Wednesday, Health Secretary Alfredo Bengzon, the panel's
co-chairman, contended the United States was using loans and aid to
pressure the Philippines into an agreement.
   He said several Philippine officials were siding with the
Americans, including the military chief of staff, Gen. Renato de
Villa.
   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
controversy reflected concern within the government that the
panel's tough stand was endangering relations with the United
States.

   A defense lawyer in the Central Park jogger
trial suggested prosecutors bought the testimony of a woman who
told the court a teen-age defendant told her he didn't rape the
woman but did fondle and hold her legs.
   Melody Jackson, 29, gave the most damaging evidence against

   Jackson, a Wise family friend who has known him since he was 8,

$50,000 bail.

don't believe you had sex with that woman,''' Jackson said during
her tearful testimony.
   ``He said, `Mel, I didn't have sex with her. The only thing I
did was touch her legs,''' Jackson told the court.
   On cross-examination by Wise's lawyer, Colin Moore, Jackson said
Wise told her he ``held and fondled'' the woman's legs.
   Moore attacked Jackson as a liar. He suggested she was
testifying for money, a plea deal with the prosecution or perhaps
for publicity as the trial's star witness.
   The lawyer asked Jackson why she had waited so long to come
forward. She answered that she had not ``come forward,'' but had
been approached by prosecutors and later subpoenaed, giving her no
choice but to cooperate.
   Moore and Howard Diller, lawyer for co-defendant Kevin
Richardson, said Lederer told them about Jackson just minutes
before she was to appear.
   Also Wednesday, prosecutors introduced a statement in which
Richardson said a scratch on his face was made by the jogger. In
the statement, Richardson denies raping the woman.
   Wise, 18, and Richardson, 16, are the second group of defendants
to be tried on charges of rape, attempted murder, sodomy, assault,
robbery and riot in the attack on the woman jogger and two men on
April 19, 1989.
   Three other teen-agers were convicted in August of rape, assault
and other charges in the attacks on the joggers, but acquitted of
attempted murder. All were sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.
   The sixth defendant, Steven Lopez, 16, will be tried separately
on the same charges early next year.
   The 30-year-old victim, who testified at the trial last week,
was found near death in Central Park. She has returned to work as
an investment banker, although hampered by vision and balance
problems.

   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
Congress Party announced today it will support a bid for power by a
leftist politician who helped lead a historic no-confidence vote
that brought down the government.
   Gandhi's decision to back Chandra Shekhar and not seek the prime
minister post himself cleared the way for President Ramaswamy
Venkataraman to ask Chandra Shekhar to form a government, a
Congress Party spokesman said today.
   Earlier today, Venkataraman had asked Gandhi if his Congress
Party was able to form a government.
   The declaration by Ghandi capped a day of meetings following
Prime Minister V.P. Singh's defeat Wednesday in a 346-142
Parliament no-confidence vote. It was the first time an Indian
government was ousted by Parliament since the country won its
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Singh's 11-month-old government collapsed under a wave of
religious and caste violence and political bickering.
   Chandra Shekhar, a veteran, left-leaning politician, led the
faction that broke away from Singh's centrist Janata Dal party and
opposed him in the vote.
   ``The party has decided to suppport Mr. Chandra Shekhar from
outside,'' Congress Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil told a news
conference today. ``That has been conveyed to the president.''
   Gandhi, when asked why he was not willing to form a government
himself, said: ``I don't think we will be able to put together a
stable government on our own.''
   No single party in Parliament's policy-making lower house has a
majority. By agreeing to support Chandra Shekhar from outside the
government, Gandhi and his Congress Party can make or break the new
government but would not hold any Cabinet posts. Gandhi could use
the opportunity to prepare his own party for new elections.
   Chandra Shekhar's dissident faction of the Janata Dal party had
only 56 votes in the 522-member Parliament when the vote agianst
Singh was taken. The Congress Party has 195 seats, and its allies
have another 15.
   Singh remains caretaker prime minister until a new government is
formed.
   Venkataraman could call new elections, but most major parties
are reluctant to face a campaign at a time when the country is in
political, sectarian and ethnic turmoil.
   Singh's coalition government was shaken by continued separatist
struggles in Kashmir and Punjab states, rising prices and by
Singh's program to raise the government job quota for low-caste
Hindus.
   The job-quota policy led to violent demonstrations and a wave of
suicides among upper-caste Hindus.
   The government was ultimately crippled last month when a
right-wing Hindu party withdrew from the broad Singh-led coalition
in protest over a shrine claimed by both Hindus and Moslems. About
370 people have been killed since in sectarian riots or clashes
with police.
   About 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus, while
12 percent are Moslem and 2 percent are Sikh.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It started as a sleeper among issues, but the
drive to limit politicians' terms is awake and kicking now, and the
people pushing the idea say they'll seek to put it on at least 15
state ballots in 1992.
   Claiming headway in both the victories and frustrations of
Tuesday's off-year elections, term-limit campaigners will meet in
Washington early next month to talk about their next steps.
   While the immediate target is the state legislatures, their
ultimate aim is to limit tenure in Congress.
   Term limits were approved Tuesday in Colorado and California,
the two states that had the issue on the ballot and, for good
measure, in Kansas City, Mo., which put a ceiling on city council
tenure. Oklahoma voted for term limits earlier in the fall.
   And then 95 percent of the House incumbents who ran again won
again, an outcome one strategist said would help the push for
limits. ``Even in an anti-incumbent year, you can't beat 'em,''
said Eddie Mahe, a Republican campaign consultant and advisor to
Americans to Limit Congressional Terms.
   It is largely a Republican movement, although some Democratic
candidates signed on during the campaign. Measures that force
turnover would work to GOP advantage; they are outnumbered in the
legislatures as in Congress, and Democrats have just extended their
House control to 38 years.
   Proposed constitutional amendments to limit congressional tenure
to 12 years have, predictably, gone nowhere in Congress. The
measure approved in Colorado on Tuesday would apply to members of
Congress as well as state officeholders, and therefore it is
certain to be challenged in court.
   So the political pressure point is in states, especially those
that hold direct elections on such questions. Elsewhere, Mahe said,
the term limit drive will be pressed in the legislatures, where
lawmakers may be loath to limit their own tenure but likely to
approve a call for limits in Congress. That might just offer some
openings for ambitious state lawmakers who'd like to get to
Washington.
   In the three states that have approved term limits, the voters
overrode opponents who insisted that limits are no cure for the
ills of government, state or federal, and could make them worse.
Strong, seasoned legislators would be dismissed along with weak
ones, the opponents say, while bureaucrats and lobbyists would gain
even more clout.
   ``I think term limits is really a reaction against the fact that
so many of our congressional elections, and our other elections,
are not really competitive,'' said Gov. Richard F. Celeste of Ohio,
chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association.
   Mahe said that when, and if, more states impose limits, or at
least call for them nationally, Congress will start to feel the
political heat. ``Once those are in place at the state level, the
pressure at the national level is going to be geometrically
increased,'' he said.
   ``This is going to be an issue,'' says Vice President Dan
Quayle. ``You had the tax revolt in the 1970s and early 1980s, and
in the 1990s, I think, you're going to see the voter revolt.''
   Campaigning for Republican candidates this year, both Quayle and
President Bush pushed term limits. The 1988 Republican platform
endorsed limits on House and Senate tenure, without saying what the
ceiling should be. Quayle says he favors 12 years.
   ``All around this country there is a growing momentum for
limiting terms of legislators,'' Bush said before the elections.
``...Term limitation is an idea whose time has come, and I think
its time has come to Capitol Hill, frankly.''
   Quayle built part of his set campaign speech around the issue.
   ``The chairman, listen to this, the chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee has been in the Congress longer than my
mother and father have been married. He had seven years of
seniority when I was born,'' he would say, drawing ripples of
laughter. ``I tell you, there is an idea that is sweeping this
country, and that is the idea that it is time to limit the
terms...''
   The chairman, Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., just won his 26th
term.
   But there is turnover, for all the power of incumbency, and more
than 60 percent of House members have been elected since 1980.
   Mahe said the organizations pushing term limits will seek
commitments from House candidates in 1992 that they won't seek to
serve more than a dozen years in Congress. ``When they're running
for the first time, 12 years looks like a long time,'' he said.
   To a veteran, though, it doesn't look that long. Former Sen.
Eugene J. McCarthy, who also served in the House, once recalled
that he'd arrived as a foe of the seniority system.
   But the longer he stayed, McCarthy said, the more he saw the
wisdom of it.

<HEAD>Gov. Jim Florio Takes Blames For Democratic Election Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRED PIERETTI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Jim Florio took responsibility for the
Democratic Party's election losses and close calls in New Jersey,
and said parts of his bitterly disputed $2.8 billion tax package
may be rewritten as a result.
   ``I got the message that the results were really directed at
me,'' Florio said at a news conference Wednesday. ``It was a strong
message, a humbling message.''
   The backlash by New Jersey taxpayers nearly cost U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley his bid for re-election to a third term Tuesday. Bradley,
considered nearly invulnerable, barely fended off a challenge from
little-known Republican Christine Todd Whitman, who lost by fewer
than 55,000 votes.
   Florio, who wasn't on the ballot because he was elected governor
just last year, said that in the wake of Bradley's close call,
elements of his tax legislation were open to possible changes,
particularly the school funding formula.
   In his first six months in office, Florio raised the state
income tax for wealthy New Jersey residents and increased the state
sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent.
   The higher income tax, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will pay
for a complex program of property tax relief and higher funds for
the state's disadvantaged schools.
   Republican leaders touted the election results as a repudiation
of the Democratic Party under Florio. Top GOP legislators repeated
their call for a repeal of the tax package.
   ``He just spawned an electoral disaster for his own party,'' GOP
State Chairman Bob Franks said.
   Florio conceded that he might have pushed his agenda too fast
and without regard for opinions outside his administration.
   At his news conference, Florio stopped well short of saying he
would consider repealing any of his tax legislation. But the
governor repeatedly said the school aid formula might be modified
and that he would discuss his administration's policies with
Democratic legislative leaders.
   ``Everything is on the table for people who are responsible and
constructive,'' Florio said in response to a question about the
school funding formula.
   State Senate Minority Leader John Dorsey said Republican leaders
have acknowledged the need for higher taxes to increase revenue for
poor school districts to comply with a state Supreme Court ruling.
But Dorsey disputed the size of the tax increase needed to comply
with the ruling.
   In its ruling, issued in June, the court said that New Jersey's
system of using property taxes to fund schools was unfair to poor
districts and unconstitutional. The state has until July 1991, to
devise a plan to improve the funding for disadvantaged schools.

<HEAD>Controller's Error Blamed in Near-Collision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A passenger jet nearly collided with a small
plane over downtown Chicago last week because of an air traffic
controller's error, the Federal Aviation Administration says.
   The crew of a United Boeing 737, en route to Seattle from
Chicago on Nov. 1 with 96 passengers, reported a ``near mid-air
collision'' with a Cessna 172, FAA spokesman Mort Edelstein said
Wednesday.
   The jet came within about 1,300 feet of the small plane
horizontally and 200 feet vertically, the FAA said. Federal
guidelines require a minimum separation of 1.5 miles horizontally
and 500 feet vertically.
   The second plane was a law enforcement plane, said Donald
Zochert, another FAA spokesman. But he declined to identify the
agency that operated it.
   A preliminary investigation indicated the controller had planned
to turn the jet but apparently failed to issue the order fast
enough, Edelstein said.
   The controller was removed from his position and has undergone
retraining, the FAA said.

   Charles A. Kelliher's 40 years a fugitive from a
Virginia chain gang have come to an end, but he says he has paid
society all it has coming and at least 100 of his friends agree.
   Kelliher's past caught up with him last week when federal
marshals knocked on the door of his Brooklyn apartment. Diane
Kelliher, his wife of 20 years, said she ``had no idea. I was
shocked about the whole thing.''
   Kelliher was taken to a New York City jail, where he has been
held without bond since Oct. 31.
   The 59-year-old former moonshine runner and self-described
hell-raiser, said he fled a prison road crew in 1950 when he was a
19-year-old rowdy from Manassas.
   ``We were out on a highway cleaning ditches,'' Kelliher said
Wednesday. ``Something happened on the other side of the road and
the guards turned and I took off.''
   Kelliher had served only a few months of a 22-year sentence when
he fled to New York. He had been convicted of getting drunk,
breaking into the county courthouse and stealing his own car, which
police had confiscated when they caught him hauling illegal
whiskey.
   ``I thought he had lost his mind - 22 years!'' he said of the
judge.
   Virginia authorities - who have a program to locate long-missing
fugitives - enlisted the help of federal law enforcers who, after
hours of stakeouts and computer record searches, traced Kelliher to
his Bay Ridge apartment.
   Donald Zimmerman, of the Virginia Department of Corrections in
Richmond, said the state still wants Kelliher to serve the 21
years, eight months he owes.
   Kelliher, with the help of attorney Philip A. DiPippo, who
learned of his case through news reports, is resisting extradition.
   ``I don't owe anybody anything. I've damn sure paid my dues,''
Kelliher said.
   ``This to me is truly all unnecessary,'' he said.
   At a hearing Wednesday, Criminal Court Judge Seymour Gerschwer
said he had no jurisdiction in the matter and sent the case to the
state Supreme Court.
   Some two dozen of Kelliher's friends - many he met through
Alcoholics Anonymous - attended the hearing to show support for
Kelliher.
   For 10 years, Kelliher has been sober and has helped and
inspired recovering alcoholics, his friends said.
   Friend Bettyann Seccia said Kelliher and his wife ``have helped
me tremendously.''
   A petition submitted to the court with more than 100 signatures
described Kelliher as ``a man of conscience and heart. Through the
years that we have known him, he has been an exemplary role model
for all of us.''

   A man believed to be a close associate of
reputed organized crime boss John Gotti was found shot to death in
a Mercedes-Benz on the side of a road, police said.
   Edward Lino was found slumped inside the car Tuesday night, said
Sgt. Nick Vreeland, a police spokesman. He had been shot at least
nine times in the chest and face.
   Lino, 48, had been tried three times on charges of drug
racketeering, accused of dealing heroin and cocaine. He was
acquitted once and the other two trials ended in mistrials.
   Detectives say they believe Lino, who lived on Long Island, was
driving home through the borough of Brooklyn when he stopped his
car to talk to his killer.
   He apparently stepped on the gas and tried to get away when the
killer opened fire, police said. The car crashed into a fence.
   Police said they did not have a motive for the killing. But New
York Newsday and the New York Post reported law enforcement sources
as saying that Lino was probably killed because of involvement with
drug dealing, which was once taboo in organzied crime circles.
   The Post quoted sources as saying that Lino became a ``made''
member of the Gambino crime family when Gotti allegedly took
control after the death of Paul Castellano in 1985.
   In February, Lino was acquitted on charges that he and two
co-defendants conspired to distribute heroin for a drug ring
managed by Gotti's brother, Gene. Gene Gotti was convicted and
sentenced to 50 years in prison.
   Lino was also a defendant in two other federal drug racketeering
cases that ended in mistrials because of alleged jury tampering.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli army officer and a Jordanian
guerrilla were killed today in a firefight on the banks of the
Jordan River, the army said.
   Four other Jordanians were captured and two were wounded.
   The guerrillas - who were armed with pistols, knives and copies
of the oran - were planning to stage an attack on Jerusalem, the
regional Israeli commander, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, told
Israel radio. He also said the men had ``links to the Jordanian
security establishment.''
   Another officer said at least four were policemen, but it was
not immediately clear if the guerrilla killed was an officer. All
five of the Jordanians wore civilian clothes.
   The predawn clash occurred north of Jericho in the occupied West
Bank, military officials said. The infiltrators were detected after
they broke through a security fence.
   Mordechai said the Oct. 8 Temple Mount shooting in Jerusalem
which killed 20 Palestinians ``may have been an incentive'' for the
infiltration.
   He also suggested the Persian Gulf crisis could have had an
influence. Many Palestinians in Jordan have been strong supporters
of Saddam Hussein.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens said the Persian Gulf crisis has
burdened Jordan's King Hussein and suggested ``perhaps this
influences his control over certain things.''
   ``I want to believe the Jordanians are doing all they can to
prevent infiltrations,'' Arens said. ``But this isn't the first
time they haven't succeeded.''
   Capt. Yehuda Lifshitz was killed in the clash, the army said. He
was to be buried in his hometown north of Tel Aviv later today.
   There have been at least seven other infiltrations or attempted
infiltrations blamed on Jordanian soldiers or police in the past
two years.
   In August, a Jordanian soldier was killed and another was
captured after they crossed into Israel. A Jordanian soldier was
captured in Israel in April trying to cross the border.
   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war. The area is home to about 1 million Palestinians and
about 70,000 Jewish settlers.

   U.S. officials have prepared a resolution
authorizing U.N. military force against Iraq but are not
introducing the measure until they are sure they have enough votes
for passage, diplomats have said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is abroad lining up key
support for the Security Council resoution, the diplomats said
Wednesday on condition of anonymity. He was visiting Moscow today
after a quick tour of several Middle Eastern nations.
   ``We know they've got it on paper, but it would be absurd for
them to pass it around until they've got all the crucial support
lined up,'' one official said.
   In Washington, U.S. officials close to the situation confirmed
the account. They also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   If approved, the U.S. draft resolution would mark the first time
the Security Council approved U.N. military force under a joint
military command.
   Iraq has defied 10 Security Council resolutions. They include an
embargo on trade with Iraq, and demands that Baghdad free all
foreign hostages, withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait and allow
the restoration of Kuwait's government.
   Baker said in Turkey that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait ``is, after
all, the first real crisis of the post-Cold War era, and it is very
important that when the United Nations takes action and passes
resolutions, those resolutions and the act be implemented.''
   Baker flew to Moscow on Wednesday to continue his diplomatic
initiative on the Persian Gulf crisis, which includes rallying
support for the use of U.N.-sanctioned military force. He then
travels to Paris and London.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in a Sept. 25
speech to the General Assembly, hinted at a U.N. military
operation, saying: ``The United Nations has the power to suppress
`acts of aggression.'''
   On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen indicated to
Baker that his country would not oppose a resolution authorizing a
military strike to force Iraq out of Kuwait, U.S. officials said.
   Qian, who met for two hours with Baker in Cairo, did not
explicitly approve sending troops into action.
   ``We'll have to wait and see,'' Qian told reporters. China is
one of the five U.N. Security Council members with veto power over
resolutions; the others are the United States, Britain, France and
the Soviet Union.
   Iraq seized oil-rich Kuwait on Aug. 2 and then annexed the
emirate.
   In response, the Pentagon has sent 230,000 U.S. troops to the
region, among a multinational force of more than 300,000. They face
about 430,000 Iraq troops deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   The new U.S. draft resolution marks the first time the Security
Council would approve of U.N. military force under Article 42 of
the U.N. Charter.
   Article 42 permits the council to ``take such action by air,
sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore
international peace and security.''
   ``Such actions may include demonstrations, blockade, and other
operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United
Nations,'' it says.
   The Security Council has never had a unified military command;
the closest approach was during the Korean War, when it authorized
the United States to command the U.N. forces repelling North
Korea's invasion.
   That was only possible because the Soviets were boycotting the
Security Council to protest Taiwan's being seated as the delegation
from China.

   A camper has been acquitted of criminal
negligence for accidentally igniting a 9,000-acre forest fire in
Hells Canyon by burning his used toilet paper.
   U.S. Magistrate Mikel Williams found Philip J. Arnold innocent
Wednesday in connection with the Aug. 20, 1988, blaze in the
Payette National Forest, which took more than two weeks to control.
   Williams noted that campfires were not banned at the time, and
ruled that Arnold, of Santa Barbara, Calif., was not aware of the
substantial risk of fire during that drought-plagued summer. In
addition, he said, the Forest Service's evidence did not prove
Arnold committed a criminally reckless or negligent act.
   Part of Arnold's defense was based on the fact that camping
books and even some Forest Service maps instruct campers to burn
their toilet paper after use.
   However, Payette National Forest Supervisor Sonny LaSalle said,
``The only safe way to deal with human waste is to bury it.'' He
said toilet paper will decompose if it is put in a 6-inch-deep hole
and covered with dirt.

   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today said
the shooting incident near Soviet leaders in Red Square should not
be taken very seriously, but officials charged the suspect with a
terrorist offense.
   The incident occurred Wednesday just 80 yards from President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials during Revolution Day
celebrations to mark the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution. No one was injured.
   The gunman, identified as Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, was being
held in custody today on charges of ``committing a terrorist act,''
said Aleskei Kandaurov, deputy director of the KGB's public
relations office. The suspect is an unemployed metal craftsman who
was last employed at the Izhorsky metal working factory in
Leningrad, Kandaurov said.
   Kandaurov could not confirm a report by one newspaper that the
gunman was carrying a light explosive in addition to a hunting
rifle.
   He confirmed the man was carrying at least one device, but said
laboratory tests have not confirmed whether it is an explosive.
   The suspect, charged by the Moscow's chief prosecutor, will
undergo psychiatric tests, Kandaurov said. He gave no other
details.
   A plainclothes officer knocked the gun away from the man after
Shmonov fired once into the air and into the ground, newspapers
said.
   ``I don't think this incident should be taken very seriously,''
Shevardnadze said before meeting with U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III. ``This is a huge country where something is always
happening somewhere.''
   Newspapers today were filled with glowing reports about the
celebrations across the country, but gave only brief reports of
several large protest rallies around the nation. Pravda criticized
the rallies as ``extravagant escapades verging on simple
hooliganism.''
   The newspapers also offered few new details about the shooting
near the Lenin Mausoleum, where Gorbachev stood with other
officials to watch the festivities.
   The conservative labor newspaper Trud said the suspect was
carrying a small explosive usually used for military rehearsals and
that could cause no serious damage.
   ``It is hard to tell now whom he was aiming at. But one thing is
clear: if it were not for the immediate reaction of a policeman,
who succeeded in knocking the gun into the air, a disaster might
have happened,'' the paper said in a short page-one report.
   During the celebrations, Gorbachev stood near officials
including Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and Moscow Mayor
Gavriil Popov.

dissension in the Iraqi military. Pickup 3rd, `The sacking...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has
dismissed his military chief of staff, prompting Western officials
to speculate there is dissension among Iraqi military leaders about
the invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam replaced Lt. Gen. Nizar al-Khazraji with the commander of
the elite Republican Guards, the Iraqi army newspaper and U.S.
officials said today.
   Western analysts with considerable knowledge of Iraq's military
said the move could indicate opposition to holding onto conquered
Kuwait in the face of the growing U.S.-led multinational force and
U.N.-imposed sanctions.
   The officials in Washington said it might even indicate
opposition to Saddam's decision to invade the oil-rich emirate on
Aug. 2.
   The sacking of Khazraji, a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war,
came amid mounting U.S. and British warnings that force might be
used to dislodge the Iraqis from Kuwait if necessary.
   ``It's very ominous,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a former analyst
with London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, now
with Control Risks, an international security firm in London.
   ``It's not wise to change horses in midstream at this point in
time. Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to
Saddam within the military, who after all may have to take on the
multinational force,'' said Kopietz. He has just returned from a
lengthy Middle East tour.
   The Iraqi army newspaper, Al-Qadissiya, named the new chief of
staff as Gen. Hussein Rashid, but did not say when he was named to
replace Khazraji.
   It mentioned Rashid's new title in a report of a graduation
ceremony he attended at Baghdad's military academy on Wednesday.
   In Washington, officials confirmed Khazraji had been replaced by
Rashid. They said Khazraji was replaced because he objected to the
invasion. Khazraji has been made a special military adviser to
Saddam, believed a demotion for the military commander, the
officials said.
   ``Khazraji was promoted to a non-job,'' said one official.
   The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Khazraji had been chief of staff since 1985 and was one of the
top officers in Saddam's inner circle of military advisers.
   ``It's very odd,'' said analyst Shahram Chubin of the
Geneva-based Graduate Institute of International Affairs and author
of books on the Persian Gulf war.
   ``It's very easy to speculate. It's not yet clear why Saddam's
done this, but he's taking a big gamble,'' he said.
   Rashid was Khazraji's deputy and commanded the 120,000-strong
Republican Guards, Saddam's best troops who are considered loyal to
him and form a virtual separate army within the million-strong
army.
   The Republican Guards spearheaded the invasion of Kuwait. During
the gulf war, Rashid commanded an armored division with some
success.
   He is believed to be from Takrit, Saddam's birthplace north of
Baghdad. Saddam has packed the hierarchy of the ruling Baath Arab
Socialist Party with relatives, by blood or marriage, who come
mainly from Takriti clans.
   Rashid's appointment is the second known top-level change in
Baghdad in the past two weeks.
   Oil Minister Issam Chalabi was fired on Oct. 28 and replaced on
an interim basis by Brig. Gen. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's cousin and
son-in-law who is also minister of Industry and Military
Industrialization.
   Kamel, who is also from Takrit, has been responsible for
developing Iraq's arms industry and producing new
surface-to-surface missiles.
   Chalabi was purportedly replaced after he imposed gasoline
rationing because of shortages prompted by the U.N. trade embargo.
That order was later rescinded and officials denied there was any
shortage.
   But Kopietz noted: ``There was more to Chalabi's dismissal than
meets the eye. He's a moderate, close to the West and the oil
industry where he was widely respected. He was understood to be
trying to persuade Saddam from pursuing his strategy of
confrontation.''
   ``It may well be that there's growing opposition to Saddam
within the Iraqi hierarchy,'' Kopietz added.
   Iraqi dissident groups have reported several purges of senior
officers since the invasion, possibly because the officers
disapproved and because Saddam apparently miscalculated how the
West would react.
   There has been no independent confirmation of reports that
officers have been executed or imprisoned. But Saddam has regularly
purged senior officers whom he suspected could threaten him since
he took power in 1979.
   Analysts believe this opposition heightened after Saddam,
seeking to secure Iraq's border with Iran as his international
isolation increased, made concessions to Iran on Aug.15.
   He agreed to Iranian demands to withdraw his forces from
territory seized in the closing stages of the Iran-Iraq war and to
share sovereignty of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway on the southern
boundary between the two countries.
   Kopietz said at the time: ``It must have been a bitter pill for
the army to swallow. They must have wondered what the hell they'd
fought the Iranians for eight years for.''
   Chubin said today: ``I'm sure there's considerable disquiet in
the military, who're not necessarily all convinced Takriti
Baathists.''

Terror</HEAD>

   Civil rights leaders breathed easier with the
indictment of a Georgia man in a series of mail bombings that
killed a federal judge and an NAACP lawyer and put the South on
edge just before Christmas last year.
   The indictment, unsealed Wednesday, also accuses Walter Leroy
Moody Jr., a 56-year-old self-employed editor, of sending racist,
threatening letters.
   He was to be arraigned in federal court today.
   The bombings and threats spread a wave of pre-Christmas terror
that had lawyers, judges and civil rights officials contacting
authorities when they received unexpected packages.
   ``We are relieved that federal authorities believe that a
suspected perpetrator has been identified, and cautious that no
other persons are or may be implicated,'' said Earl Shinhoster,
Southeast director of the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People.
   He said the bombings ``created a climate of uneasy apprehension
for many of us in the civil rights community that will not be
easily abated even with the indictments.''
   Moody, for months a leading suspect in the case, was charged in
the slayings of appeals Judge Robert Vance of Mountainbrook, Ala.,
on Dec. 16, 1989, and civil rights lawyer Robert Robinson of
Savannah two days later.
   The nail-packed bombs bore marked similarities to one that Moody
was convicted of possssing in 1972, federal authorities said. They
said all three bombs were constructed by a method not used in any
of more than 10,000 bombs they had examined over the years.
   The indictment also accuses Moody of sending bombs to the 11th
U.S. Circuit courthouse in Atlanta - Vance was a member of the 11th
Circuit - and to the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla. Those two bombs
were safely defused.
   In addition, Moody was charged with sending dozens of
threatening letters to NAACP officials, lawyers, judges and TV
stations, and with sending a tear-gas bomb that went off at the
NAACP's Atlanta office.
   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and FBI Director
William Sessions, who announced the indictment in Washington, said
authorities believe Moody acted alone.
   Officials declined to say what his motive might have been, but
it has been speculated that racism or revenge against the judicial
system prompted the attacks. Moody is white, as was Vance.
Robinson, a Savannah city alderman who did legal work for the
NAACP, was black.
   The letters, some signed ``Americans for a Competent Federal
Judicial System,'' said the killings were in retaliation for court
decisions on school desegregation and black-on-white crime. They
threatened more violence against lawyers, judges and the NAACP.
   Six of the charges, including murder of a federal judge, carry
up to life in prison.
   Moody's attorney, Bruce Harvey, charged that the indictment
lacked evidence linking his client to the crimes.
   ``We need to see some facts,'' he said. ``We need to see some
hard evidence.''
   Moody, described by his lawyer as a quiet man ``who very much
desires to be left alone,'' has been known to be a prime suspect in
the case since FBI agents searched his home in Rex in February.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, an Enterprise, Ala., junk dealer who
wrote numerous letters to the 11th Circuit, had also been a
suspect.
   Authorities declined to say if he has been cleared, but his
lawyer, Paul Harden, said O'Ferrell had been told Wednesday he is
no longer a suspect.
   Thornburgh declined to say what, if any, relationship Moody had
with O'Ferrell. Police at one time believed that O'Ferrell had been
in possession of the typewriter used to write the letters that
followed the bombings.
   O'Ferrell's wife, Mary Ann O'Ferrell, picked Moody's wife,
Susan, out of an FBI lineup in Alabama Oct. 18, identifying Mrs.
Moody as the woman to whom she sold a typewriter in the spring of
1989, Jefferson County, Ala., Sheriff Mel Bailey told The
Birmingham News.
   Bailey was out of his office this morning and Anthony Bishop, a
lawyer for O'Ferrell, declined to comment on the lineup report.
   Mrs. Moody's lawyer, Sandra Popson, would not confirm that her
client participated in the Bessemer, Ala., lineup. On Oct. 19, Mrs.
Moody filed for divorce.
   Moody and his wife have been in custody since July, when they
were indicted on perjury and witness tampering charges involving
his 1972 bomb conviction.
   That bomb was intended for an auto dealer who had repossessed
Moody's car, but Moody's first wife mistakenly opened the package
and was seriously injured, authorities said.

<HEAD>Palestinian Kills Israeli Arab Prison Guard, Kahane Supporters
Detained</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian stabbed to death an Israeli Arab
prison guard today, and police detained seven followers of slain
Rabbi Meir Kahane on suspicion of incitement after they vowed to
avenge his death.
   One of those detained, Yekutiel Ben Yaakov, said in his eulogy
that Kahane's men would ``let our friend the submachine gun, our
friend the knife, talk for us.'' Kahane was assassinated by an Arab
in New York on Monday.
   The Kahane supporters were arrested at the Jewish Idea seminary
run by the late extremist rabbi's Kach movement, a spokesman said.
Police said the seven were being held on suspicion of incitement.
   Meanwhile, police guarded Israeli Arab leaders, Jewish leftists
and journalists after they received death threats from supporters
of the anti-Arab Kach movement. Police said four shots were fired
outside the home of the mayor of the Israeli Arab town of Shfaram
on Wednesday.
   Today's fatal stabbing occurred in Jenin prison in the occupied
West Bank, a military source said. The victim, a Druze guard, was
attacked by a Palestinian visiting an inmate.
   The incident was the latest in a rash of knifing attacks by
Palestinians following the Temple Mount killings last month in
which 20 Arabs were killed by police during riots.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded an Arab
after he tried to stab a soldier at a roadblock. The soldier
escaped unharmed because he was wearing a flak jacket, Israel radio
said.
   The army said that in the wake of the knifings, it has begun
issuing the padded jackets to some soldiers, including those
manning roadblocks and standing guard in the occupied territories.
   The Haaretz newspaper, meanwhile, quoted a Kach leader as saying
the group had drawn up a hit list. Security officials told the
daily that Kahane's heavily armed followers may go underground to
organize attacks.
   Mayor Ibrahim Nimer Hussein of Shfaram said police have warned
him he might be in danger. He said a police van passes by his house
at regular intervals, and police frequently call him to make sure
he is all right.
   Israeli Arab legislator Wahab Abdel Daroushe said he received a
call from someone who identified himself only as a ``good
Israeli.''
   ``He said that `Kahane's people have put you on their list and
decided to kill you,''' Daroushe said, adding that police posted
guards outside his home.
   Another Israeli lawmaker, Yossi Sarid of the left-wing Citizens
Rights Movement, reported receiving death threats, and said police
were guarding him.
   ``I'm a target and I know it,'' Sarid said. ``The mood now is
very tense. If you look at the reports about Kahane's funeral, one
name was mentioned specifically by the crowd - my name.''
   During the funeral, attended by 15,000 people, hundreds of
Kahane supporters went on a rampage attacking Arabs, stoning
police and smashing shop windows. At one point, scores of rioters
stoned and beat members of an Israel television crew.
   ``Suddenly you find yourself a target for the mobs,'' television
reporter Benny Liss told army radio. ``Worse than the blows is the
humiliation. They pulled off my skullcap.''
   Another journalist, Sima Kadmon, wrote conservative Maariv daily
today that she was shocked by the hatred at the funeral.
   ``I covered (Arab) demonstrations full of hatred and violence,
and I swear by our God and their God that I was never as afraid as
yesterday in the streets of Jerusalem,'' she wrote.
   Few Palestinian workers came to Jerusalem, apparently out of
fear or as part of a two-day general strike beginning today to mark
the one-month anniversay of the Temple Mount riots.

<HEAD>Students Demonstrate Against Ershad, 20 Injured</HEAD>
<HEAD>Laserphoto DHA-1</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-government demonstrators demanding
the resignation of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad fought with
police today, exploding homemade bombs in the center of the
capital.
   Riot police fired rifles in the air and used tear gas and
steel-tipped batons to disperse the protesters, who were mostly
students, according to journalists at the scene.
   They said at least 20 people were slightly injured by police.
   The trouble began after police blocked a march by about 3,000
people toward Ershad's office, erecting barbed wire barricades over
a one-mile perimeter from the building.
   The students threw stones, and police responded with truncheons.
Witnesses said the students retreated in groups and began rampaging
through the streets.
   At least 30 cars, jeeps and buses were damaged, reporters said.
Police fired in the air and lobbed tear gas shells near Dhaka
College, and students responded with homemade explosives.
   Opposition political parties, with wide student support, are
campaigning for Ershad to quit before elections are held next year.
   The opposition contends the three elections held since Ershad
seized power in a bloodless coup in 1982 were rigged. Ershad, a
former general, has refused to step down before the election, which
he intends to contest.
   Eight anti-government protesters were killed in demonstrations
last month.

   Albanian President Ramiz Alia said his
hard-line Communist country should rethink enshrining the Communist
Party's leading role and policy of atheism in the constitution, the
state news agency said.
   Alia, who is trying to introduce cautious reforms and bring his
Balkan country slowly out of self-imposed isolation, also decried
bureaucracy and a lack of discipline while calling for stronger
rule of law.
   The comments by Alia, head of the Communist Albanian Labor
Party, to the party's Central Committee appeared to be another
cautious step toward reform.
   The speech also seemed timed to influence a Paris summit that
will decide later this month whether to admit Albania to an
all-European system of cooperation and human rights.
   In the speech reported by the ATA news agency on Wednesday, Alia
did not say the Communists should give up power or legalize a
political opposition, nor did he suggest a specific constituional
ammendment.
   The constitution refers to the party as the ``only leading
political force in the state,'' but Alia said Communists won that
status ``through struggle, work, self-denial, and adherence to the
interests of the people and the homeland.''
   That echoed Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rationale
earlier this year for calling on the Soviet Communist Party to give
up its guaranteed monopoly on power.
   Alia called for strengthening the rule of law, saying it would
only solidify the party since the law is based on party policy.
   ``The law stands above all,'' he said. ``No instruction,
decision, order or authority exists above the law.'' Failure to
recognize the supremacy of law leads to ``injustice and chaos, and
causes great social damage.''
   Albania is the only hard-line Communist country left in Eastern
Europe, where revolution last year toppled Communist governments.
   But earlier this year, cracks began showing in Albania's
Communist edifice as well. About 5,000 Albanians slipped past
guards to make their way to embassies in the capital, Tirana, and
were allowed to emigrate.
   Alia also said the 1976 constitution, which declares an official
policy of atheism, violates the right of religious belief.
   ``Just as it is anyone's right to be an atheist, so he must not
be prohibited from believing,'' Alia said. But he did not make a
clear statement calling for that policy to be eliminated.

<HEAD>`Subfertile,' A Play by Tom Mardirosian, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hero of Tom Mardirosian's new play, a
character not unlike Mardirosian himself, faces 40 fearfully, talks
to dinosaurs in the Museum of Natural History, favors loud bowling
shirts and suffers from a low sperm count.
   This autobiographical trivia doesn't sound like the stuff of
good comedy but it is, particularly because the protagonist is
played by Mardirosian himself, a balding raconteur with a wry,
humorous outlook on life.
   His play is called ``Subfertile,'' and it opened Wednesday in
the tiny studio theater at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons.
   Mardirosian's last comedy, ``Saved from Obscurity,'' was done
there two years ago and dramatized his struggle to become an actor.
With ``Subfertile'' he struggles to become a father.
   The journey to parenthood isn't easy, according to Mardirosian.
You think Connie Chung and Maury Povich have problems? The
roadblocks for our hero aren't just physical. There are expensive
and uncaring doctors, humiliating medical examinations, the endless
questions of well-meaning friends and the inevitable tensions
between husband and wife.
   But Mardirosian manages to make the difficulties comic, often
outrageous fun. The playwright takes a personal, conversational
tone with the audience. He talks directly to them.
   The actor starts with his first sexual experiences, back as a
teen-ager in Buffalo, N.Y., and works his way up to the present. He
covers his college and post-college dalliances as well as the
problems he and his wife Jackie have when they try to conceive.
   One highlight is an operation Mardirosian endures to improve his
sperm count. The anesthetic produces a hilarious fantasy sequence
right out of ``Star Trek'' - call it ``Sperm Trek'' - in which
Mardirosian becomes a Spock with soul and sensitivity.
   The playwright-actor gets expert help from four other actors,
some in a variety of roles. They include Frederica Meister, who
plays his beleaguered wife; Richard Council as two different
doctors and his obnoxious blue-collar childhood friend; Susan
Knight as a giggly beauty-parlor operator he beds, and Kitty Crooks
as a third doctor who tries to get him out of his predicament.
   Director John Ferraro doesn't let the evening spin too long. At
90 minutes, it's exactly right. ``Subfertile'' further cements
Mardirosian's reputation as a playwright of promise whose best
subject is himself.

   Lawrence Durrell, the British novelist whose works
evoked the exotic imagery of the Mediterranean, has died at his
home in southern France, his family said today. He was 78.
   The cause of his death on Wednesday was not disclosed. Durrell
had been fatigued for about two weeks, a family member said.
Durrell told The Washington Post in 1986 that he was suffering from
emphysema.
   Durrell, who was a close friend of American novelist Henry
Miller, died in Sommieres, a small town in the Provence region near
the Mediterranean coast where he had lived for 24 years.
   His best-known work was the Alexandria Quartet series, the
elements of which came from the time he spent in Alexandria, Egypt,
during World War II. The novels, written from 1957 to 1960, are
``Justine,'' ``Balthazar,'' ``Mountolive'' and ``Clea.''
   Durrell's verse - romantic, taut and often humorous - began
appearing in 1938. It includes, ``Collected Poems,'' ``Red Limbo
Lingo,'' and ``Vega and Other Poems.''
   Durrell was born in 1912 in India and spent his boyhood in the
northern city of Darjeeling near the Tibetan border. His father, a
civil engineeer, had gone to India to help build the country's
first railroads.
   Lawrence was one of four children. His younger brother, Gerald,
a ``zoomaniac,'' as Lawrence called him, is a well-known naturalist
and author.
   The elder Durrell said in a 1982 interview:
   ``When I was looking back the other day to what the hell my
career had been, I found I was really trying to find my way back to
India. I think I really must have been marked by that enormous
silence up in the mountains.''
   At the age of 18, he left India for London, where he dabbled in
jazz and poetry without much success. In 1935, he first encountered
Greece, the inspiration for some of his works.
   Durrell and Gerald moved to Corfu, an Ionian Island off the West
Coast of Greece. It was from there he began a near 50-year
correspondence with Miller. Letters between the two were published
in two volumes in 1963 and 1988.
   Durrell described the letters once as, ``full of of insight,
full of fun.''
   He moved to Rhodes three years after World War II. He later
lived in Argentina, England, Yugoslavia, then moved to Cyprus in
1952.
   Cyprus was the inspiration for his work ``Bitter Lemons,''
written in 1957, while living in southeastern France. The book is a
vivid, many-faceted account of Cyprus during the
British-Turkish-Greek struggles there.
   It was also while living in France that Durrell wrote the
Alexandria Quartet. The series - written in a lush, baroque prose
style - took as its theme love as a means of self-discovery. It is
a portrait of an English writer's life amid the inhabitants of
Alexandria, Egypt.
   The author called his quartet, ``a continuum of words,'' ``a
relativity poem.''
   Durrell once said, ``I regard writing as a fascinating bore and
wish it were better paid. I intended to die young and have the
following words on my tomb: `Lawrence Durrell wishes you great
passions and short lives.' If I die old it will only need altering
one word.''
   Four years ago he emerged briefly from his self-imposed privacy
to accept an award of Commander of Arts and Letters.
   In 1988, several love letters written by Miller to Hollywood
actress Brenda Venus, part of Durrell's personal papers, were sold
at a London auction.
   In London, the Press Association news agency said Durrell's last
book, ``Caesar's Vast Ghost: A Portrait of Provence,'' will be
published next week by Faber and Faber.
   Matthew Evans, managing director of Faber and Faber, said:
``What he wanted to do was write a book which paid tribute to the
part of France he lived in for so very many years.
   ``He knew it was his last book ... and only recently saw the
first copy.''
   In the 1986 Washington Post interview, Durrell said he had
suffered bad health problems in recent years.
   ``Suddenly, in my old age I've toppled into emphysema and no
longer can travel or stand on my head or do anything enjoyable
except drink,'' he said.
   Durrell was married three times and had two daughters, one each
by his first and second wives. His youngest daughter, Sappho-Jane,
died in 1985, Durrell's oldest daughter, Penelope Berengaria
survives him.
   Information on his wives and funeral plans were not immediately
known.

   President Bush conceded today that ``I'm not
talking victory'' about the 1990 elections in the wake of
Democratic gains in Congress. But the president quickly added that
GOP losses were less than the historic average.
   ``I didn't do as well as I'd like,'' the president said at a
news conference.
   Democrats strengthened their hold on Congress by gaining one
Senate seat and nine in the House. Republicans were quick to
contend that those losses were below the historic average for a
first-term president in his first congressional elections.
   Democrats counter that the average loss of two dozen House seats
normally occurs after the president carries many House candidates
into office with him. That didn't occur in 1988, when Democrats
gained three House seats despite Bush's victory.
   ``I'm not talking victory because I am very disappointed about
how some of the races turned out,'' Bus said in his first public
discussion of the elections results.
   He cited the defeat of Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of
Minnesota by Democrat Paul Wellstone as particularly disappointing.
   Invited to announce his plans for 1992, Bush brushed off the
question by saying, ``No decision has been made.''
   The president did not accept any responsibility for GOP losses,
although many analysts said before the voting that Republicans were
hurt when Bush dropped his tough line against any tax increases.
   ``I don't think there is any confusion about how I feel about
taxes,'' he said. ``I'm going to hold the line on taxes.''
   The president was less bullish about the election results than
some of his party leaders, who were energetically arguing that the
losses were a victory because they were not much worse.
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown and Republican Party
spokesman Charles Black raced from one joint appearance to another
Wednesday. Brown declared the 1990 outcome ``a no-confidence vote''
on Bush, while Black found in the results ``a good day for the
Republican Party.''
   The conflicting views mean little to citizens of Arizona who are
headed for a runoff vote perhaps months away to determine the
identity of their next governor.
   Republican Fife Symington held a lead of fewer than 5,000 votes
over Democrat Terry Goddard in the race to succeed Rose Mofford as
governor of Arizona. About 10,000 votes went to other candidates
and the state constitution requires that if no candidate gets 50
percent of the votes, the top two meet again in a runoff.
   Until the race is settled, Mofford will remain governor.
   Also undecided are two House races in California, two of them
involving Democratic incumbents, Doug Bosco and Jim Bates.
   With all other races decided the 1990 outcome was this:
   -Democrats gained one Senate seat to increase their majority to
56-44. All Democratic incumbents won; only one Republican lost -
Wellstone unseated Boschwitz.
   -The Democrats also picked up nine House seats to pad their
majority to 268-167, assuming the two unsettled California races go
to the Republican candidates who now are leading.
   -Governors provided the most excitement. The Republicans
retained California, but the Democrats captured statehouses in
Florida and Texas from the GOP. When the dust had settled the
Democrats held 28 governorships and the Republicans 19. Two were
won by independents - Lowell Weicker in Connecticut and Walter
Hickel in Alaska.
   Those are the numbers. Defining them was the job of the Browns
and Blacks.
   ``Americans read George Bush's lips yesterday, and they made it
clear they didn't like his message,'' said Rep. Beryl Anthony,
D-Ark., chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee.
   The outcome ``wasn't due to any kind of national trend, I don't
think, or issue, so much as it was something about (each)
individual member,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill.
   Control of congressional and legislative reapportionment was a
special goal of both the 1990 campaign. In this area the Democrats
looked like clear winners.
   Overall, Democrats emerged from Tuesday's vote with
redistricting monopolies in 17 states. Republicans control the
process outright in just three states, New Hampshire, Utah and
Vermont, none of them redistricting battlegrounds.
   The victories of Lawton Chiles over Republican Gov. Bob Martinez
in Florida and Ann Richards over GOP businessman Clayton William in
the Texas governor's race gave the Democrats the monopoly of the
redistricting process in those two key states that will gain seven
House seats between them.
   Black insisted that ``our party is very well-positioned not only
for 1992 but for the rest of this decade.''
   That assessment was based on the GOP's having a voice in
redistricting for 231 of the 435 congressional districts, roughly
65 more than 10 years ago.
   One of the biggest surprises in the results was the defeat of
Democratic Gov. Jim Blanchard of Michigan by Republican John
Engler. ``This is simply an overpowering moment,'' said Engler, who
a week ago looked to be far behind in the polls.
   Other incumbent governors who lost were Republicans Kay Orr of
Nebraska, Mike Hayden of Kansas and Edward DiPrete of Rhode Island.
   Why were governors hit harder than members of Congress?
   Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia,
traced their vulnerability to the policies of the Reagan
administration.
   ``Reagan transferred the authority and the responsibility and
the fiscal burdens to the states, and the governors were forced to
raise taxes,'' he said.

   A Roman Catholic man died after
being shot by two gunmen in his Belfast home, police said today.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the Wednesday
night attack, but police said they suspected killers linked to
extremist Protestant factions.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the victim, Gary Campbell,
22, had no known connection with the security forces or
paramilitary groups.
   Campbell was watching television when two gunmen walked through
the unlocked front door of his house and fired four shots, police
said. He died on the operating table at nearby Mater Hospital.
   Neighbors said the gunmen casually drove away after the attack.
Police said the car was stolen and was set ablaze in a Protestant
neighborhood about a mile away from the shooting scene.

<HEAD>Woman Loses Eye, At Least 10 Others Affected By Tainted Drops</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One woman lost an eye after using eye drops
that were contaminated by bacteria and at least 10 other people are
under treatment after using the same drops made by a local
pharmacy, doctors said.
   At least four city hospitals are treating patients whose eyes
have been injured by the contaminated drops, The Pittsburgh Press
reported in today's editions.
   So far, one woman who used the drug has had a badly infected eye
surgically removed, at least two others could lose eyes, and two
more have lost sight in an eye, the newspaper said.
   The patients, mostly women 55 to 78 years old, underwent
cataract surgery in the past month.
   Joseph Kilkeary, who identified himself as the manager of
Hieber's Drug Store, said Wednesday night that he was unsure how
many people received the medicine the pharmacy produced, but it's
``somewhere between 20 and 200.''
   Eye surgeons at Allegheny General Hospital's ophthalmology
department determined the drops were contaminated by bacteria as
they cared for a woman suffering from a severe internal eye
infection, the newspaper said.
   ``Her doctor thought the stitches from her cataract surgery
three weeks ago had broken and become infected, but it turned out
to be far more severe,'' said Dr. John Kennerdell, the department's
chairman.
   The woman's right eye was removed last week when large doses of
antibiotics failed to save her vision.
   Laboratory tests linked the infection to the Indocin drops, a
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication made at the pharmacy by
mixing powdered Indocin with other solutions.
   Kennerdell on Monday got the names of the four physicians who
were prescribing the medication. Later that day, three more
patients with identical symptoms were referred to Allegheny
General.
   At the same time, patients were being treated for infection at
other hospitals - three at Central Medical Center, one at St.
Francis Hospital and three at Eye and Ear Hospital.
   Indocin, produced by Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme, is taken orally for
pain caused by diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Many eye
specialists prescribe it in the form of drops.
   Kilkeary said Hieber's has made the drops for years ``without
any problems whatsoever.''

<TEXT>
   The leaders of Poland and
Germany said today a treaty confirming their present border would
be signed soon, settling decades of debate over the frontier and
ethnic Germans in Poland.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the announcement at his summit with
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, their first meeting
together since German unification on Oct. 3.
   Kohl said the treaty would be signed this month in Warsaw, but
did not give a specific date.
   ``We are deeply convinced that real peace will be possible only
if Germans and Poles march together along this road into a peaceful
future,'' Kohl told reporters.
   ``We want this border to bring us closer and not to divide
Europe between the developed rich and the poor,'' said Mazowiecki.
   The border along the Oder and Neisse rivers, established by the
victorious World War II Allies in 1945, gave Poland 40,000 square
miles of German territory as compensation for an even larger
portion of Poland taken by the Soviet Union.
   Many Germans continued to question the border, hoping for a
return of the Silesian, Pomeranian and East Prussian lands that
comprise about a third of present-day Poland.
   The treaty - whose text was completed last week - commits
Germany to relinquishing the claims.
   A second treaty, not yet completed, seeks to lay the groundwork
for future cooperation, including close economic ties, German aid
for Poland's shift to a market economy and provisions for the
German ethnic minority in Poland.
   No date has been set for the signing of the friendship treaty.
   Kohl greeted Mazowiecki at the picturesque, centuries-old city
hall in Frankfurt an der Oder. Mazowiecki arrived in a motorcade
that crossed a bridge over the Oder River.
   Before the meeting began, Germany forgave nearly $500 million in
loan payments owed by Poland.

   Rescue teams have recovered wreckage from
a U.S. Army helicopter that disappeared off the Greek coast on
Wednesday.
   The U.S. Embassy said today the three crew members remain
missing, but a police official in Isthmia, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said human remains were spotted near the crash site
35 miles southwest of Athens.
   The UH-1H Huey helicopter crashed in the Saronic Gulf while en
route to Hellenikon U.S. Air Force Base, adjacent to Athens
International Airport.
   The helicopter was on a training mission from the U.S. Army 6th
Aviation Detachment based in Vicenza, Italy, said an embassy
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official
declined to identify the crew.
   Greek military aircraft and vessels continued today to comb the
area for the missing crew.
   The semi-official Athens News Agency, quoting unidentified Greek
military sources, said the helicopter landed at a small Greek
island near Corfu in northwestern Greece because of mechanical
problems.
   After repairs, the helicopter continued its flight.

<HEAD>Papers Says Top Executives Back Local Management</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of the Daily News denies
union claims that it is calling the shots in the newspaper's
handling of its 2-week-old strike.
   ``This is a New York situation and it will be solved by the
Daily News management in New York,'' said Charles Brumback,
president and chief executive officer of the Tribune Co. of
Chicago.
   Labor leaders have charged that the Tribune Co. provoked the
strike to try to break the unions and, failing that, close the
paper.
   Brumback called those charges ``baloney.'' He conceded that some
advertisers had pulled out and that distributing the paper was a
major problem.
   The News said Wednesday that Brumback and Tribune chairman
Stanton Cook visited the paper Tuesday to reaffirm support for the
paper's management and its determination to keep publishing.
   The unions, representing 2,100 workers, had been working without
contracts since March 30.
   The News, whose pre-strike daily circulation of 1.09 million
made it the nation's third largest metropolitan daily, had insisted
during negotiations that it could not survive without ending what
it called union featherbedding. The paper began recruiting
permanent replacements in the spring in anticipation of a strike.
   A group of clergymen, expressing concern over the economic and
social damage of the strike, went to the News Building on Wednesday
to urge the News to return to negotiations with its striking
unions.
   The clergymen also criticized union violence but aimed most of
their barbs at the company.
   Speaking for a clerical ``Coalition of Conscience,'' the Rev.
James A. Forbes Jr., senior minister of Riverside Church, said the
tactic of hiring permanent replacements for striking employees
``seriously undercuts management's claim to be bargaining in good
faith.''
   ``This company is not anti-union,'' said Lisa Robinson, a
spokeswoman for the News. ``We have negotiated for the better part
of this year and continue to be open to the bargaining process.
That is the place to resolve differences with the parties directly
involved.''
   The News has been publishing daily during the strike, and says
150 of the 350 Newspaper Guild editorial workers have returned to
work.

   The Justice Ministry plans an amnesty for about 2.5
million people to mark the coronation of Emperor Akihito next week,
a ministry official said Thursday.
   The official said the scale of the planned amnesty was announced
after a meeting between Vice Minister of Justice Yasuchika Negoro
and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Other details of the pardons, expected to be mainly for traffic
violations, have not been made public, he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   More than 10 million people received amnesty to mark the funeral
of Akihito's father, Emperor Hirohito, in February last year.
   Akihito, who became emperor immediately after Hirohito's death
in January 1989, is to be formally enthroned in ceremonies
beginning Monday.
   The Japanese government declares such amnesties to mark events
it deems to be of major historical importance. An amnesty also was
declared in 1972, when Okinawa was returned from U.S. to Japanese
jurisdiction.

<TEXT>
   A 150-year-old German-made contrabass
was stolen from Danish jazzman Niels Henning Oersted Pedersen in
Germany, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   ``I've been playing on it since 1963. It's like losing an arm,''
Oersted Pedersen, also known as ``NHOP'' among jazz fans, told the
Copenhagen daily, Politiken.
   Oersted Pedersen said he might have to cancel concerts across
Europe unless the instrument is recovered.
   ``I sound like that contrabass. And that sound can hardly be
recreated on another instrument,'' he said. The contrabass, the
largest instrument in the violin family, has a range an octave
below a normal bass.
   The contrabass disappeared last Friday at the Frankfurt-am-Main
international airport in Germany where Oersted Pedersen was
attending a jazz festival with Belgian guitar player Philippe
Catherine. The two were also to make a record in a German studio.
   Oersted Pedersen, 44, owns another contrabass, a French-built
instrument from the 17th century. ``But I don't dare travel with
it. It's too fragile,'' he said.

   Iran approved $14 million in relief aid
for areas hit by an earthquake that killed at least 22 people and
left 12,000 homeless, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Thursday.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani also called for formation
of a center to deal with natural disasters.
   Cabinet officials, still grappling with rebuilding projects
following a June quake that killed 50,000, approved the funds late
Wednesday, according to the agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Tehran radio said rescue and medical teams were bringing food,
clothes, blankets and other essentials to the stricken region
around the city of Darab in southern Fars province.
   The temblor, which struck late Tuesday, measured 6.6 on the
Richter scale and devastated 18 villages. Two of the villages were
razed and about 100 people were severely injured.
   Most of the victims were children under 12 years old who were
sleeping at the time, the radio reported earlier.
   Also Wednesday, the radio said the earthquake caused sustantial
damage to parts of adjoining Hormozgan province. It said casualty
figures were not available.
   On June 21, a quake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck
northern Iran, leaving 500,000 people dead and about 500,000
homeless.
   In a meeting with officials of Gilan and Zanjan provinces, which
bore the brunt of the June catastrophe, Rafsanjani said he was
satisfied at efforts to rebuild the areas.
   A radio report last week estimated only half the refugees from
the June quake have found shelter, weeks before temperatures
normally plunge below freezing.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union today gave its qualified approval
to the use of military force to push Iraqi occupiers out of Kuwait
if peaceful measures fail.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III came to Moscow seeking at
least Soviet acquiescence to the Bush administration's intention of
having the U.N. Security Council authorize the use of force to
liberate Kuwait as a last resort.
   ``Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out - probably
this could not be ruled out - and a situation may emerge which
effectively would require such a move,'' Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said following talks with Baker.
   Baker said the two governments had agreed on the principle that
a peaceful settlement to the crisis in the gulf is preferable but
the use of force could not be ruled out.
   Earlier, Shevardnadze had said the use of force would be
``undesirable'' and that ``the No. 1 task of the international
community is to see that the U.N. resolutions are implemented.''
   Baker met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at his
official country residence outside the city and held sessions with
Shevardnadze before and after that meeting.
   More than three months of economic and political sanctions have
failed to persuade Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reverse the
Aug. 2 invasion of his smaller, oil-rich neighbor, Kuwait.
   Shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the
Iraqis should be taken by the United Nations. ``We should not doubt
the ability of the Security Council to take wise and mature
decisions,'' he said.
   ``I would advise against looking for some difference in the
positions between the Soviet Union and the United States,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Meanwhile, differences still stood in the way of a treaty to cut
non-nuclear weapons in Europe less than two weeks before the
landmark treaty is due for signing at a 34-nation summit meeting in
Paris.
   ``My guess is that we would be able to find a solution to all
the problems,'' Shevardnadze said during a break in his talks with
Baker.
   President Bush has said he would not attend the Nov. 19-21
summit in Paris unless the treaty is ready. A U.S. official said
the problems were more than technical, but he did not describe
them.
   Hanging in the balance is another accord to cut U.S. and Soviet
long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30 percent.
Shevardnadze said there were ``some difficult problems'' with that
pact, which Bush had hoped to sign at another summit meeting this
winter.
   The outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues,
including how much leeway the Soviets would have to keep testing
their SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles.
   A senior U.S. official said Wednesday the worldwide economic
boycott was inadequate to force Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein out of
Kuwait.
   Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told Baker on Tuesday in
Cairo that Beijing would not block a resolution authorizing the use
of force against Iraq. However, the Chinese minister stressed his
government's preference for a political settlement.
   Baker needs acquiescence from Gorbachev before the United States
makes its move in the U.N. Security Council for a resolution
authorizing force and another demanding that Iraq permit the
resupply of the beleaguered U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait.
   After more than three months of a trade cutoff and other
sanctions, the Iraqi president has not budged in his determination
to hold on to Kuwait as an annexed province.
   President Bush and Baker had expressed confidence that once the
sanctions bit, the Iraqi leader would have to reassess.
   As he left Ankara, Baker said, ``We would all like to see a
peaceful, diplomatic, political solution to this problem. At the
same time, it is the view of our president and the United States
that we cannot rule out the use of force.''
   He added that ``credibility of the United Nations is at stake.''
   One step Baker took in Cairo was to assure Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak of logistical help getting the 14,000 Egyptian troops
in Saudi Arabia into combat if there was a war.
   Gorbachev's special Middle East envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, was
more positive about the chances for peace, saying there had been a
``big difference'' in the tenor of his discussions with Saddam
between a first meeting in September and a second on Oct. 27.
   ``In the second meeting, thre was no mention (by Saddam) that
Kuwait is part of Iraqi territory.'' Primakov told reporters at a
Kremlin reception.
   ``I put it like this to him: `If you do not withdraw, you will
face a military strike against you. ... He said that he was in a

   One loser in this year's election planned to
sleep for 24 hours. Another already is casting a hopeful glance
toward the next contest. Still another is rumored to be under
consideration for a post in President Bush's Cabinet.
   ``I'm not a wealthy person. I'll get a job to pay my bills,''
said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., who failed to capture the
gubernatorial seat in his home state.
   The final outcome of Tuesday's voting was a major disappointment
for eight of the 12 House Republicans and Democrats who harbored
higher political aspirations.
   But three GOP House members - Larry Craig of Idaho, Hank Brown
of Colorado and Bob Smith of New Hampshire - won open Senate seats
in their home states. The results were hardly a surprise as
Republicans formerly held the posts.
   And in Ohio, Rep. Mike DeWine was elected lieutenant governor on
a Republican ticket headed by George Voinovich.
   An ignominious finish was evident in Illinois, Michigan, Rhode
Island, Hawaii and Iowa where the Republican Party had heavily
recruited rising House GOP stars to battle longtime Democratic
incumbents.
   Earlier this year, the GOP believed the Senate seats were for
the taking. However, it wasn't so and it left defeated Republican
candidates mulling their future.
   ``I have no idea, zip, zero,'' Rep. Claudine Schneider said
after losing to Sen. Claiborne Pell, 62 percent to 38 percent. ``I
am a public servant and I have not even begun to think about where
my next service will be.''
   The five-term congresswoman, considered one of the most liberal
Republicans in the House, never managed a serious challenge to
Pell, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   In Illinois, Republican Lynn Martin had little to say Wednesday
after a lopsided loss to Sen. Paul Simon. The Democratic incumbent
cruised to a 65 percent to 35 percent victory, even winning
Martin's home county.
   Martin has been mentioned as a possible replacement for
Elizabeth Dole, who stepped down as Bush's Labor secretary to head
the American Red Cross.
   And a defeated Republican might also land a job in the
administration as director of drug control policy. William Bennett
is resigning.
   Questioned about future jobs in the administration for either
Martin or Schneider, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday that no decisions had been made. Bush reiterated that at
a news conference Thursday.
   Fitzwater described Martin and Schneider as good candidates whom
the administration plans to work with on their futures.
   Rep. Tom Tauke, R-Iowa, who failed to unseat Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin, said he planned to sleep for 24 hours. He also expressed an
interest in returning to the state ``to work with the people of
Iowa, perhaps in teaching.''
   In Michigan, Rep. Bill Schuette lost to Democratic Sen. Carl
Levin, 58 percent to 42 percent, despite the Republicans' upset
victory in the gubernatorial race. John Engler knocked off
incumbent Democrat James Blanchard.
   The win for Engler could be a blessing in disguise for the
37-year-old Schuette, who could receive a job in the state
government until a possible challenge to Michigan's other senator,
Democrat Donald Riegle.
   Riegle's reputation has been tarnished by his ties to the
savings and loan scandal.
   ``I'm taking a break from politics. I have no immediate plans,''
Schuette said after the loss.
   In Hawaii, Rep. Patricia Saiki failed to defeat Democratic Sen.
Daniel Akaka but already is being mentioned as a possible candidate
for governor in 1994 or perhaps for a Cabinet post in the
administration.
   Democratic Rep. Joseph Brennan, who once served as governor of
Maine, failed in his bid to return to the post but vowed to remain
in public life after more than 30 years of service.
   Elsewhere in New England, Republican Rep. John Rowland and
Morrison lost to independent Lowell Weicker in a close race for
governor of Connecticut. In his concession speech, the 33-year-old
Rowland indicated future bids are in the offing.
   ``Perhaps the state of Connecticut was not ready for a new
generation of leadership, but sometime in the future they will
be,'' Rowland said.
   Morrison, who discussed doing political work outside an elective
office, said after the loss that he wanted to get a ``good night's
sleep.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who opened fire on Red Square during the
Revolution Day parade has been charged with committing a terrorist
act, a spokesman for the KGB secret police said Thursday.
   Alexander A. Shmonov, 38, of Leningrad, will undergo psychiatric
tests to determine whether he was sane at the time of the shooting
Wednesday, said Alexei Kandaurov, deputy director of the KGB public
relations office. He gave no other details on the case.
   No one was hurt in the incident, in which the man pulled out the
hunting rifle in the heavily guarded square about 80 yards from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. The shooting came during a
Communist Party march that followed the military parade.
   A plainclothes officer knocked the weapon away as the man fired
once into the air and again into the ground, newspapers said. He
then was subdued by about 20 plainclothes officers and carried into
the GUM department store across the square from Gorbachev.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze played down what may
have been an assassination attempt, categorically denying that it
indicated a loss of public support for Gorbachev's ``perestroika''
reform policies.
   ``I don't think this incident should be taken very seriously,''
Shevardnadze told reporters before meeting with visiting Secretary
of State James A. Baker III. ``This is a huge country where
something is always happening somewhere.''
   Shmonov was interrogated and spoke in detail about his
preparations for the act, the official Tass news agency quoted KGB
investigator Pyotr Sokolov as saying.
   Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Janis Dzenitis on Thursday sanctioned
Shmonov's arrest, Tass reported. Shomonov is charged with
committing ``an attempted terrorist act,'' the news agency quoted
Sokolov as saying.
   Kandaurov could not confirm a report by one newspaper that the
gunman was carrying a light explosive in addition to the rifle.
   The conservative labor newspaper Trud said Shmonov was carrying
a small explosive usually used for military rehearsals that could
cause no serious damage.
   Kandaurov said the man was carrying at least one device, but
added that laboratory tests would have to confirm whether it was an
explosive.
   ``It is hard to tell now whom he was aiming at,'' Trud said.
``But one thing is clear: If it were not for the immediate reaction
of a policeman, who succeeded in knocking the gun into the air, a
disaster might have happened.''
   KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov indicated Wednesday night that
officials believed the man was deranged.
   Shmonov is being held in the KGB's isolation ward, Tass
reported.
   Shmonov is an unemployed metal craftsman who last worked at the
Izhorsky metal working factory in Leningrad, Kandaurov said.
   Soviet newspapers on Thursday carried front-page pictures of the
gunman being subdued by plainclothes security.
   Newspapers were filled with glowing reports about the
celebrations across the country Wednesday, the 73rd anniversary of
the Bolshevik Revolution.
   There were only brief reports about anti-Gorbachev rallies by
hard-liners and radicals, which the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda criticized as ``extravagant escapades verging on simple
hooliganism.''

<TEXT>
   State health officials have banned the
sale of the nutritional supplement GHB, which they say has been
linked to 22 illnesses ranging from nausea to seizures and coma.
   GHB, also known as gamma hydroxybutyric acid, is commonly
substituted for L-tryptophan for strength training, body building
and weight loss.
   State Health Director Kenneth Kizer said state and federal
officials are investigating the 22 illnesses linked to GHB, known
to cause central nervous system disorders including seizures.
   Kizer on Tuesday banned further sales of GHB and urged consumers
to stop taking the chemical until further notice.
   It is the third time in a year that health officials have taken
action to stop the sale of nutritional substitutes. The sale of
L-tryptophan was banned in November 1989 after it was linked to a
rare blood disorder. In July, the sale of Cal-Ban 3000 was stopped
because of blockages of the esophagus.

   William Bennett, stepping down today as
President Bush's anti-drug abuse chief, said convicted cocaine user
Mayor Marion Barry made his job harder because ``he was part of the
problem.''
   Bennett said that as head of the Office of National Drug Control
Strategy, he devoted special attention and resources to the
District of Columbia not to make it a showcase, but because it was
``a basket case.''
   Bennett was asked how Barry's cocaine problems - which resulted
in a conviction for cocaine possession and a six-month prison
sentence - affected the Bush administration's efforts on drugs.
   ``Did the fact that the mayor used cocaine and crack make it
easier or harder? It made it harder,'' he said. ``You got a real
serious problem when the chief executive officer of the city that
has a drug problem is taking crack. ... I didn't know it at the
time. But I suspected that his interest in the topic was different
from mine, and we were going to get less than 100 percent
cooperation.''
   He said, however, he did not ``find any hard evidence that would
have held up in a court of law'' about Barry's drug use.
   ``I did not think he was part of the solution. He's part of the
problem,'' said Bennett, who was criticized in some quarters for
bringing the federal anti-drug effort into Washington, D.C.,
without much consultation of city officials.
   Bennett gave a vote of confidence to the city's mayor elect,
Sharon Pratt Dixon, a Democrat who beat the Republican Bush
supported, Maurice Turner.
   Bennett also said that a frequent critic of his drug policy,
Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select Committee
on Narcotics Abuse and Control, ``is a gas bag. He has nothing to
do with drug policy.''
   President Bush, accepting Bennett's resignation, saying he had
done a ``superb job for this country'' in fighting the war against
drugs.
   Asked if he had anyone in mind to replace Bennett or Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who resigned two weeks ago, Bush said,
``Not yet. I haven't even begun to sit down seriously with lists.''
   Bennett said that he is leaving government to become a fellow at
the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank.
   As to speculation he might seek public office, the outspoken
conservative said, ``Not any time soon.''
   With his trademark feistiness, Bennett said he wanted to dispel
rumors he was leaving out of unhappiness.
   ``So far I have read that I am bored, restive, restless, tired,
unhappy, moping about lack of media attention, sulking about not
being in the Cabinet, in a snit with John Sununu, all sorts of
things ... and being stampeded out of town.''
   Bennett said it ``there are people who don't like me,'' but that
``I'm not the stampeded out of town type.''
   Bennett was asked about reports of threats against his life
during the time he headed the government's efforts against drug
kingpins.
   ``There's threats. They have been there since the beginning of
this job,'' he said. But he brushed off that aspect as a factor in
his decision to leave.
   He said that when he traveled to Alaska on an anti-drug mission,
he received ``some anonymous threats ... from some pot heads that
they were going to blow me up.'' But the effort misfired, he said,
because, ``one of the notices from the pothead societies said come
confront Bennett,'' but it was distributed after he already had
left the state.
   Bennett plans to complete a book contract that he had agreed to
before he took the anti-drug job, friends said. The book deal was
to focus on his experiences as education secretary under President
Reagan, but Bennett also is interested in writing about the drug
war, one source said.
   He is expected also to speak on the lecture circuit.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today gained ground in his
attempt to win support for a U.N. resolution authorizing military
action against Iraq when the Soviet Union gave its qualified
approval for using force.
   Also today, Iraq's army newspaper and U.S. officials said Saddam
Hussein has replaced his military chief of staff with the head of
the elite Republican Guards. Western analysts said the move could
indicate dissension within the military over Saddam's decision to
invade Kuwait and annex it despite condemnation by the West and the
deployment of the multinational force.
   It was the second replacement of a high-level Iraqi official in
two weeks and also pointed to a tightening of Saddam's inner
circle.
   In another development today, former German Chancellor Willy
Brandt secured the release of 50 more Westerners trapped in Iraq in
a second meeting with Saddam, the Iraqi News Agency reported. It
listed those to be freed as 20 Germans, 15 Italians, 10 Dutch and
five Britons. It did not say when they will be able to travel out
or provide their names.
   On Wednesday, Saddam agreed to allow 100 Germans and 20 people
of other nationalities to leave in response to a plea from Brandt.
   He is the latest of several former government officials who have
come to Iraq seeking the release of captives. Hundreds of other
hostages, many of them Americans, remain trapped in Iraq, some held
as ``human shields'' at strategic sites to forestall an attack by
the U.S.-led mutinational force.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said on Wednesday that the
United States has readied a Security Council resolution that would
authorize the use of military force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   If such a measure were adopted, it would be the first time the
U.N. authorized a joint military command. During the Korean War, it
authorized the United States to command the U.N. forces repelling
North Korea's invasion.
   The text has not yet been circulated because Baker is trying to
line up support for it on a Middle Eastern and European tour, said
the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In Moscow, Baker met today with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Baker wants Moscow to
acquiesce to using force as a last resort to liberate Kuwait, which
Iraq seized on Aug. 2.
   ``Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out, probably
this could not be ruled out, and a situation may emerge which
effectively would require such a move,'' Shevardnadze said after
the talks.
   He reiterated, however, that any decision to use force against
Iraq should be taken by the United Nations.
   ``I would advise against looking for some difference in the
positions between the Soviet Union and the United States,''
Shevardnadze told reporters.
   Earlier, at the opening of his first session with Baker,
Shevardnadze had said the use of force against Iraq would be
``undesirable.''
   The patience of U.S. and British officials with Iraq appears to
be running short. On Wednesday, in her strongest statement yet,
Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said ``time is running
out'' for a peaceful solution.
   But Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in an interview with
The New York Times today that the multinational force massed in
Saudi Arabia to counter Iraq should give the U.N. sanctions ``at
least two to three more months.'' About 14,000 Egyptians are in the
multinational force.
   Iraq's army newspaper Al-Qadissiya today disclosed in an article
about a graduation ceremony that Gen. Hussein Rashid, head of the
Revolutionary Guards, is the new chief of staff. It did not say
when he was named, or what happened to Gen. Nizar Al-Khazraji,
chief of staff since 1985. The change of personnel was confirmed by
officials in Washington, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Saddam regularly purges those he perceives as a threat, and the
Republican Guards are considered Saddam's best troops.
   But one London-based analyst called the firing, ``very
ominous.''
   ``Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to
Saddam within the military, who after all may have to take on the
multinational force,'' said the analyst, Hans-Heino Kopietz. He
works with Control Risks, an international security firm in
   The U.S. officials who confirmed Khazraji's dismissal said he
was replaced because he had objected to Saddam's decision to invade
Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, 260 Poles left for home today aboard an Iraqi jet
after Saddam's government agreed they had fulfilled work contracts
and were free to go, a Polish Embassy spokesman said.
   More than 70 Japanese freed by Iraq arrived today in Tokyo, and
three Britons, two Australians and a Dutchman arrived in Amman.
   Ten British women left for Baghdad today against the advice of
their government, hoping to secure the release of their loved ones.
They urged restraint by the countries facing off with Iraq.
   Iraq still holds hundreds of Americans, Britons, Japanese,
German and other Westerners, calling them ``guests.'' Some have
been put at strategic installations as ``human shields'' against a
feared attack.

   A fourth-grade teacher's civics lesson that
tried to nudge parents to vote backfired when one girl's parents
complained that they had a right not to vote.
   Karen Christman-Phillips objected to Elizabeth Chan's Election
Day homework assignment for her daughter, Shannon.
   Chan told her class the children did not have to do the day's
homework assignment if their parents voted.
   Christman-Phillips said Shannon was angry with her parents
because they did not vote.
   ``It is not a child's fault whether or not her parents are
voting,'' she said in a letter to Chan.
   Christman-Phillips said the incident embarrassed her daughter
and made her feel ``she's not up there with the other students
because her parents don't vote.
   ``Voting is  privilege and it's my right whether I want to vote
or not,'' she said.
   Christman-Phillips said she doesn't vote because she's not
``politically involved.'' Her husband, Michael Phillips, said he
missed registering this year because the family just moved from
Florida.
   Chan, a 20-year teacher and a member of the League of Women
Voters, concedes she made a mistake.
   But she said the incident taught her students ``that in a
democracy you can protest things you don't like.''
   School Superintendent Walter Gibson said Chan ``crossed a
line,'' but he didn't plan any disciplinary action.
   ``She probably didn't show good judgment, but I don't believe
her intent was malicious,'' he said.

   President Bush said today Republicans didn't
do as well as he had hoped in midterm elections and that the lesson
he learned from Tuesday's defeats of incumbent governors was that
``people feel they've been taxed too much.''
   He said he would ``absolutely'' promise to oppose any new tax
increases. However, Bush hedged somewhat, adding that, ``sometimes
you run into realities.''
   In a gloomy assessment about the economy, Bush said, ``We're in
some tough times right now.'' He said he would consult with
economists both in and out of the government to discuss ways to
soften the blow.
   Bush avoided use of the word ``recession,'' describing the
economy as in a slowdown.
   In his first public appearance since the disappointment of
election night, Bush was asked whether he thought he had damaged
himself politically by accepting $140 billion in tax increases as
part of a budget reduction accord with the Democrats.
   ``I oppose raising taxes,'' he said. ``We had this one
compromise, and that just reenforced my views.'' He added, ``I
don't think what I did was popular with anyone. But like the umpire
you've got to call them as you see them.''
   Bush said, ``I wish I had a Congress that would do it just my
way, because I am convinced we can do it (cut the deficit) without
any tax increases.'' But he acknowledged that voters had rebuffed
his campaign efforts to put more Republicans in the House in the
Senate. Instead, the GOP lost ground in both legislative chambers.
   ``I'm not talking victory'' after moderate GOP losses in the
House and Senate. Six incumbent governors, of both parties, went
down to defeat, generally reflecting tax or economic woes.
   Bush said he expected Democrats would attempt to pass more tax
hikes, and said, ``they're going to do it over my dead veto.''
   ``If that's the case we're in for a whale of a fight,'' he said.
``We're not going to compromise on that.''
   He revived his no-new-tax pledge, saying, ``Can I make a promise
I won't support them. Absolutely. But sometimes you run into some
realities. But I'm girding up my loins to go into batle to beat
back the tax attempts that I think are coming.''
   House Speaker Tom Foley said on Wednesday there is support among
Democats for attempting to pass a surtax on millionaires, one of
the provisions that was omitted from the deficit reduction plan
that the president signed earlier this week.
   At the same time, Bush said Republican losses in gubernatorial
and congressional races were well below historical trends for a
party that controls the White House. He said the results won't
``tie my hands at all'' in dealing with the Democratic-controlled
102nd Congress that convenes in January.
   Bush ducked a question about his own re-election plans for 1992.
He is widely expected to run for a second term. His remarks came in
a press conference that followed his appearance with retiring drug
policy administrator official William Bennett.
   Bennett said he believed Bush would run for reelection, and win.
   Bush said he was not at the point of deciding on a replacement
for Bennett or Elizabeth Dole, who announced last month she was
resigning as Labor Secretary.
   Bush turned aside attempts to question him about the Persian
Gulf, where the administration is expected to increase the current
force of more than 200,000 troops.
   Bush offered his assessment of the midterm elections after
nearly complete returns showed a Democratic gain of one seat in the
Senate and nine in the House. Several incumbent governors of both
parties were turned out of office, and Democrats took away the
governorships in Texas and Florida.
   Bush mentioned two other politically-charged issues: he said he
would be submitting a new crime bill to Congress and called on the
Democrats to pass it.
   And he said he would submit a civil rights bill that would not
include hiring quotas. The president vetoed a civil rights bill in
the final days of the congressional session, saying it would lead
to hiring quotas. The Senate sustained the veto by one vote.

   Conservatives have taken out full-page
advertisements in major newspapers and on television to support
President Bush's policies in the Persian Gulf.
   Sam Zakhem, a former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, said in a
telephone interview from Denver, Colo., that he and others formed
Coalition for America at Risk two months ago whn some
conservatives seemed to waver in their support of Bush's decision
to send 225,000 troops to defend Saudi Arabia.
   ``Many people run out of patience and this is a very important
thing for the national interest of the United States,'' he said.
   The coalition's prominent right-wing members include David Keene
of the American Conservative Union; retired Maj. Gen. John K.
Singlaub, who was involved in sending weapons to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels in the Reagan administration; and Doug Wead, who
resigned earlier this year as Bush's liaison to conservative and
religious groups.
   To bolster support for Bush, the coalition took out ads in
several newspapers as well as on television.
   ``Support President Bush and the brave men and women of
Operation Desert Shield working to free Kuwait,'' reads part of a
full-page ad.
   It has appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Times, The Washington Post
and USA Today. A full-page ad in The Washington Post's front
section costs $19,000.
   Zakhem said he informed Bush of the coalition's plan in early
September. A recent public opinion poll by ABC News found about 65
percent of Americans approve of Bush's handling of the gulf crisis.
   Zakhem said the ads are being paid for by the coalition's
well-heeled backers.
   But Otalie English, a spokeswoman for Keene Shirley &amp;
Associates, the public relations firm representing the coalition,
said the campaign is supposed to be self-supporting once it gets
off the ground.
   The newspaper ad invites readers to call a toll-free telephone
number for a ``free emergency action kit.''
   English said the kit includes a bumper sticker and several 900
telephone numbers. Callers can - for a fee - receive updates on the
situation in Kuwait and learn to set up a grassroots organizing
campaign, she said.
   The toll-free number has been flooded with requests, Zakhem
said.
   He said the coalition hopes for a peaceful solution to the gulf
crisis, but he added that question is up to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.

<TEXT>
   With pulsating pelvises, two male police
officers wrapped their legs around a microphone stand and got down
on all fours and shook their posteriors at a jury.
   The performance Wednesday was intended to mimic the dancing of
nude women in the ChippenDolls nightclub. The officers hoped to
offend the jurors and convince them that the dancing was obscene.
Instead, they made the jurors smile and drew laughter from
courtroom spectators.
   The jury began deliberations Thursday.
   The trial of Jennie Davis, 24, was expected to help establish
the Richland County's standards of obscenity. Three other dancers
are to go on trial at a later date.
   Solicitor Jim Morton pleaded with jurors to ignore the humorous
aspects of the case.
   ``The officers aren't too excited about getting out here and
dancing a little,'' Morton said. ``But you are being asked today to
determine what the community of Richland County will allow or not
allow.''
   But jurors and spectators laughed when Ms. Davis' attorney,
Brian Dumas, submitted copies of Playboy magazine to show that
county residents can obtain material that is just as sexually
suggestive as nude dancing.
   The officers, Jim Potash and Scott Desrochers, admitted during
cross-examination they had purchased Playboy for themselves or
viewed X-rated movies at home.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that nude dancing that is not
obscene is protected under the Constitution. Communities must
define their own obscenity standard based on what forms of
expression are so offensive that the average citizen would find
them obscene.
   Ms. Davis is charged with exposing her body in an obscene
manner, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum punishment of six
months in jail or a $500 fine.
   Columbia police arrested the dancers and the nightclub's manager
during an early morning raid July 28 after a four-week
investigation.

<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing Rabbi Meir Kahane,
the controversial anti-Arab activist, had thrown a tantrum hours
earlier after learning of an unwanted job transfer, according to a
report published today. A city spokesman denied the report.
   El Sayyid A. Nosair was arraigned on murder charges from his bed
at Bellevue Hospital's intensive care unit Wednesday but entered no
plea.
   Nosair has been hospitalized since he was wounded by a U.S.
Postal Service police officer minutes after Kahane was shot to
death Monday night. Nosair was listed in serious condition today.
   He was conscious but unable to speak during Wednesday's
arraignment. He wore an oxygen mask.
   New York Newsday reported today that Nosair became angry just
hours before Kahane's slaying after learning that New York City was
transferring him from his job in Manhattan to one in of Brooklyn.
   Nosair had worked for the city's General Services Department
since April 1988 maintaining the Manhattan court complex's air
conditioning and heating systems.
   Joe Warren, a General Services supervisor, said Nosair was a
good employee and the transfer was routine.
   ``From time to time, we just send our people around,'' he said.
   Warren said he was unaware Nosair was unhappy. Newsday cited an
anonymous source who said he threw a tantrum. But John Beckman, a
spokesman for the General Services Department, said today that he
had checked into the newspaper's report and concluded that story of
the tantrum was untrue.
   Authorities say Nosair, 34, shot the controversial Kahane once
in the neck Monday night before fleeing the hotel where the Jewish
Defense League founder was speaking. He was captured about a block
away after a shootout with a U.S. Postal Service police officer.
   Nosair was charged with murder, attempted murder, assault,
unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon and of a
defaced weapon. Police said the murder weapon, a .357-caliber
revolver, had its identification numbers filed off.
   Criminal Court Judge Harvey Glasser scheduled another court
proceeding for Tuesday and ordered Nosair, who U.S. authorities say
is from Egypt, held without bail.
   Records in this country, where Nosair is now a naturalized
citizen, show he was born in Port Said, Egypt, on Nov. 16, 1955,
and graduated from a college in Cairo, where he studied industrial
engineering. However, Gen. Ahmed Zaatar, an assistant to the
interior minister of Egypt, said Wednesday that government records
in Port Said show no listing for a man born there with that name.

<HEAD>Report Says Foreign Demand Will Rescue U.S. Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy, if it does topple into a
recession, will be rescued by an export boom led by foreign demand
for chemicals, aircraft and scientific equipment, a trade group
said Thursday.
   The National Association of Manufacturers said a survey of 120
of its member companies found them expecting exports to double from
10 percent of their total sales to 20 percent by 1993.
   An export boom has accounted for more than one-third of total
economic growth in the country since 1986. American companies have
benefited from a weaker dollar, which has boosted demand for U.S.
products overseas.
   With the U.S. economy mired in a period of sluggish growth and
possibly headed for a recession, many analysts believe domestic
demand will remain weak for some time.
   ``The best opportunities for American companies and the American
economy are going to be outside U.S. borders between now and
1995,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of NAM.
   In forecasting which American products will do well, the NAM
report said high-growth export areas such as chemicals, aircraft
and scientific instruments should continue strong.
   Foreign sales of U.S. chemicals jumped 70 percent between 1985
and 1989, while aircraft sales were up by 67 percent and scientific
instruments climbed a sharp 75 percent during the same time period.
   In its report, ``U.S. Manufacturers in World Export Markets,''
the trade group said traditional industries such as machine tools,
textiles and paper products would also see export growth in coming
years. However, America is still running trade deficits in those
areas because of foreign sales in this country, the group said.
   While much attention has focused on the emerging economies of
Eastern Europe as potential markets for U.S. goods, the NAM report
said those countries were likely to play only a small role in
boosting export sales in coming years.
   The countries of Western Europe and Canada now buy more than 50
percent of U.S. manufacturing exports and the NAM report forecast
demand for U.S. goods would remain strong, especially with the
creation of a single market in the 12-nation European Community.
That's scheduled to take place in 1992.
   More modest trade opportunities will be found in Eastern Europe,
Mexico and China, the report said.
   U.S. companies traditionally have been more interested in the
huge U.S. market, but Jasinowski said the growing importance of
exports had made many industries reconsider their sales strategy to
place more emphasis on foreign markets.
   He said that with many economists forecasting a recession,
issues of how to promote economic growth were likely to move to the
forefront. A primary area of opportunity should be boosting
America's competitiveness by removing foreign trade barriers, he
said.
   One key way to do that, he said, would be to have a successful
conclusion of a four-year effort to reform world trade rules. The
talks, involving more than 100 countries under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are scheduled to conclude
in December.

<TEXT>
   Alaska voters have become the first in
the nation to give the Green Party official standing, and leaders
say the change will spur environmental activism.
   ``We're going to build the grassroots support for the party in
every community we can,'' Jim Sykes, the Green Party's
gubernatorial candidate, said Wednesday. ``We'll try to get people
on city councils. We'll field candidates for the (state) House. We
may even field a candidate for U.S. Congress,''
   Sykes received 5,630 votes, or 3.2 percent, in Tuesday's
election, after a fight last summer that led to a court decision
ordering his name placed on the ballot.
   Sykes' tally was above the 3 percent margin needed to gain his
party recognition from the state and guarantee the Greens a spot on
future ballots, said state Election Supervisor Barbara Whiting.
   Sykes said the party will continue to organize around its
central issues - health, the environment, citizens' access to
government and grassroots economic development.
   ``If the Democrats and Republicans don't get off the dime, I see
tremendous growth for the Green Party in the coming decade,''he
said.
   Green Party officials said it was the first time in America that
the fledgling party had achieved official status.
   ``It's very big news to us,'' said Jim Richmond, coordinator of
the Green Party's national clearinghouse in Kansas City, Mo. ``It's
the first state in the country where we're officially going to be
on the ballot in 1992.''
   Green Party candidates also ran unsuccessful campaigns in
California's 19th Congressional District, north of Los Angeles, for
a city council position in Fayetteville, Ark., and in several local
races in Vermont, Richmond said.
   The party is modeled after environmentalist parties in Europe
which since 1981 have sent members to several nations' parliaments.
It began organizing in the United States in 1984.
   Sykes was the only candidate in the Alaska governor race to
oppose opening the continental shelf of the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development.
   Wally Hickel, a former governor and pro-development millionaire
running as an independent, regained the post. Democrat Tony Knowles
and Republican Arliss Sturgulewski split most of the rest of the
vote.

   Sailors serving with the Royal Navy in the Persian
Gulf are using money they get for donating blood to telephone home
to wives and sweethearts, a reporter said Thursday.
   ``The sailors complain that they cannot telephone home for free,
unlike the personnel of other nations' navies serving in the
potential war zone,'' said Ian Graham of Press Association, the
British domestic news agency.
   Some calls to Britain from the gulf cost more than $3.90 a
minute.
   The report quoted one unidentified sailor as saying local
hospitals paid nearly $60 to blood donors, ``just enough for a
decent call.''
   A defense ministry spokesman in London said: ``We have heard
about this but we think they shouldn't do it because hygiene out
there may not be as good as ours. While men are free to do what
they want off duty, they are supposed to keep fit for duty.''
   He added that air mail is free for the armed services and the
men's overseas allowance was calculated to include telephone calls.

<HEAD>Abortion: Philosopher Tackles Dilemma, Suggests `Brain-Life'
Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A philosopher proposes applying the same
legal standard to abortions as is widely used in determining if a
person is dead - is the subject's brain active?
   A model law proposed at an international conference in Iowa
City, called the Uniform Determination of Life Protection Act,
would permit abortion of a fetus until the 70th day, or 10th week,
after conception.
   Hans-Martin Sass of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics said that
after the 70th day the fetus should be a protected human life
because it then begins developing a brain capable of determining
individual characteristics and thought processes.
   ``The absence of brain-specific cells in early embryonal
development could be understood as the absence of brain-life,'' he
said. In that case, ``abortion of inanimate life must be legally
protected.''
   Sass, senior research fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based
Kennedy Institute and professor of philosophy at Georgetown
University proposed the act at a University of Iowa symposium that
ended Wednesday. He also is co-director of the Center for Medical
Ethics in Bocum, Germany.
   About 60 medical, ethics and legal experts from 15 countries
attended the four-day symposium to examine when life actually
begins.
   The proposed act essentially describes protected human life as
starting when the brain begins to function and ending at death,
when the person is declared brain-dead. That life could be called
brain-life, Sass said.
   Advances in technology forced doctors to consider the value of
human life when organs such as the heart stop functioning, an event
that previously would have meant death, Sass said. Because of that,
a Uniform Determination of Death Act was created to define when a
person is brain-dead; many state statutes are based on that model.
   ``In strong contrast to the consensus regarding the end of life,
we do not have a uniform understanding regarding the beginning of
human life, which has to be morally recognized and legally
protected,'' Sass told symposium participants.
   Sass said the model act would not force a person opposed to
abortion, or contraception, into using either method. People should
be free to exercise their own personal philosophical and religious
views when dealing with themselves, he said.
   He rejected claims that aborting a fetus before its brain
develops unfairly destroys that fetus' potential for becoming a
specific human being.
   ``We violate the potentiality principle all the time,'' Sass
said. ``Every lost opportunity for cohabitation violates the
principle. So do all forms of contraception ... chastity of priests
and nuns, sexual acts which do not lead to fertilization.''

<HEAD>Marines Call up More Combat Reserves For Gulf Duty</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS new grafs 3-4 with additional Air Force and Army
reserve call-ups</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Marine Corps said today it ordered another
90 combat reservists to active duty for deployment in Operation
Desert Shield. That brought to 723 the number of Marine combat
reserves put on active duty this week.
   The Marines are the first service to activate combat reserves
for the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Also today the Air Force said it planned to order to active duty
265 doctors, dentists and other medical specialists who are members
of the Air Force Reserve.
   The Army also was expected to announce new call-ups of support
forces from reserve units.
   The Marines today said 90 members of the 773rd Marine Attack
Helicopter Squadron from Marietta, Ga., were ordered to active duty
to become part of the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, which is
assembling at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
   On Tuesday, the Marines announced that 633 combat reserves, plus
191 combat service and service support troops from reserve units,
were being added to the 5th MEB, which is expected to deploy to the
gulf area to replacement a brigade already there.
   A senior Marine officer said in an interview Wednesday that
hundreds more Marine combat reserves were likely to be called as
the service pieced together expeditionary brigades to replace the
three that have been in the Middle East since late summer.
   The Army is considering ordering combat reserve units to active
duty for Desert Shield, but no announcements have been made.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's morning
news conference on Thursday:
   President Bush: Well, I am announcing today that Bill Bennett,
America's first director of the office of national drug policy, has
offered his resignation. And with much regret, I have accepted it.
His decision to return to private life is obviously welcome news to
his family, but there is no doubt that his energetic contributions
to public life will be sorely missed.
   When we took office, Bill Bennett took on one of the most
important initiatives of our administration, the national drug
control strategy, our blueprint, if you will, for the war on drugs.
And he confronted the problem head on, helping lead America's
determined effort to take back the streets. And his hard work has
paid off. We devoted unprecedented new resources to the fight, new
money, new material, new manpower, for law enforcement, for
treatment, for prevention. And never before has so much effort
involving so many people been applied to the battle against drugs.
   Bill's efforts have helped spark a fundamental change in
attitude, an awareness that drugs can take away your family, your
job, your health, your freedom, and indeed, your very life. As we
have seen on the road first hand, he's inspired communities across
the country to get involved in this battle, and I have enjoyed my
many travels with him.
   Both Bill and I are encouraged by recent very promising signs
that suggest the drug problem is diminishing, not only in the
suburbs, but in the cities, as well. And I know he believes, as I
do, that we're on the road to victory. So we're going to stick to
our comprehensive drug strategy, we're going to renew our call for
Congress to pass a true crime bill, one that's tough on criminals,
not on the police, and my administration will remain on the front
lines until this scourge is stopped.
   On behalf of all Americans, I want to thank Bill for his
leadership on this issue and express my gratitude for all that he
has done to unite the nation against the scourge of drugs. Block by
block, school by school, child by child we will take back the
streets and we will never surrender. And Bill Bennett has done a
superb job for this country, and I will always be very, very
grateful to him. Now I'd like to ask him to say a word or two, and
then I'd be glad to take a couple of questions and I'm sure he
would as well.
   Bennett: Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
   Bush: Well done.
   Bennett: Thank you. Mr. President, thank you very much for your
words and for the confidence that you put in me in asking me take
this job. As you remember, I volunteered for the job. I had an
opportunity earlier on in the Reagan administration to serve this
country and the children of this country, and then to have a second
opportunity to do that was a rare privilege indeed.
   All I want to say now - and, of course, I'll be happy to take
questions later on about our policies and our programs - but all I
want to say now again is thank you and talk a minute about the
difference that you have made.
   Your taking this issue on, your saying in that inaugural address
that this scourge will stop, coincided with the great American
change of mind about drugs. But your leadership at crucial points
has made a great deal of difference. You said in your inaugural the
scourge will stop. That was against the advice of some to take on
this issue, but you took it on.
   Second, you remember that trip to Cartagena. And many advised
you not to go, and public opinion polls were advising you not to
go. But we thought it was serious, you thought it was serious and
merited your being there, and you were there.
   About a month and a half ago, when we issued our report,
``Update on the War on Drugs,'' you stated again that this was a
top priority of yours. You have been there every time we have asked
you to be there and you have taken this issue unto yourself. The
American people know that, and are grateful to you for it.
   The elections - mid-term elections just took place. No one has
commented because I guess it hasn't been noticed yet, but there was
hardly any sign during those elections that any Democrats sought to
challenge you on the issue of drugs, because you are credible,
because you have taken this task up, because everyone knows that
you have taken it seriously and made an unprecedented commitment.
   While we're on politics, it's my belief, Mr. President, you will
conclude this term very successfully, you will be re-elected as
president of the United States in 1992, and in 1996 you will be
thanked by your countrymen for a profound and great service, not
least of which, because in 1996 when the American people look at
this issue, they will see the drug problem much improved. Thank you
very much, sir.

<TEXT>
   A judge today barred the Cable News Network from
televising recordings of telephone conversations between jailed
Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and his attorneys. CNN called
the order unconstitutional and said network ``will continue our
coverage.''
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler said as details of the tapes came out in court.
   Following an emergency hearing this morning, the judge ordered
the network not to televise any tape that could infringe on
Noriega's attorney-client privilege.
   The emergency hearing, revolving around attorney-client issues
and First Amendment rights, was called after CNN used excerpts from
the jailhouse tapes this morning and said it planned to televise
another installment this evening.
   After issuing a temporary injunction, Hoeveler said he would
continue to study the issue and expected to have a final decision
by around 6 p.m., when the network was scheduled to have the second
installment.
   CNN President Tom Johnson issued a statement saying that an
appeal of the temporary injunction was being readied and adding:
``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts.''
   CNN attorney Daniel Waggoner said an ``any order, even one of a
few hours as the court has imposed here, that prevents any
publication or telecast, is an unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   Steve Haworth, CNN spokesman, said the network was continuing to
televise a segment that was first used this morning, which includes
segments of Noriega audio tapes that do not involve his attorneys.
Haworth declined to comment on whether any tapes involving
attorneys would be used later.
   Federal prison officials said inmates' phone conversations are
routinely monitored, except when they are talking to their lawyers.
But CNN said in its report this morning that it ``has a tape which
appears to be excepts of a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team. CNN has also been shown evidence that there are other
such recordings.''
   Conversations between a lawyer and client are deemed to be legal
secrets, except in extraordinary circumstances.
   Noriega has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
southwest of Miami since shortly after he surrendered to U.S.
troops in Panama following the invasion last December.
   He is awaiting trial on a February 1988 drug trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   Noriega attorney Frank Rubino told the judge that a CNN team
informed him Wednesday night they had obtained seven recordings
made by the Justice Department at the Metropolitan Correctional
Center.
   CNN televised excerpts today, offering a translation of a
Spanish conversation between Noriega and an unidentified man about
consolidating Noriega's power base in Panama, and a message to the
Cuban embassy in Panama.
   But CNN also played another tape for Rubino, who identified it
as Noriega's conversation with three defense team members.
   ``Can General Noriega receive a fair trial when every day we
wake up to the threat of our case strategy being aired to 400
million listeners, and the prosecution learning details of our
defense?'' Rubino asked.
   ``Without a doubt this is the most serious violation (of
attorney-client privilege) I have ever experienced in my years of
practice,'' Rubino told Hoeveler.
   The judge asked Waggoner whether he thought the network had the
right to ``shoot his (Noriega's) defense right in the head'' by
cablecasting the tapes.
   Gregory Bogdan, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons in
Washington, said all telephone calls leaving federal prisons are
monitored.
   All prisoners sign a release form in both English and Spanish
notifying them of the procedure, and signs are posted over prison
phones reminding inmates that the calls are monitored, he said.
   ``But if they let us know they are calling their attorney, then
we don't monitor them,'' Bogdan said.
   Tapes are kept to prevent crimes from being planned behind bars
and are not normally released, he said.
   He said he did not know if CNN's tapes were official government
tapes, adding: ``Right now, the matter is under investigation -
where the tapes came from, where they were made.''
   Hoeveler said he would order the FBI to determine the source of
the tapes.
   Prosecutors told the judge they had not heard the tapes and
would be ``blindfolded'' during the investigation of how they were
released.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, Margaret Thatcher said yesterday that either
Saddam Hussein must get out of Kuwait soon, or Britain and its
allies will remove him by force. Do you agree with that, and how
soon?
   A: Well, let me say, I should have thrown a caveat in. I'm going
to take some questions on the Middle East this afternoon, so if
you'll excuse me, I'll defer them till then. But I'm not, I won't
take any now on that subject at all.
   Q: Do you have a replacement?
   Q: All right, what about politics?
   A: Sure, try that.
   Q: OK. You went around the country telling Americans you had to
have more Republicans in Congress to get the economy going and to
cut the deficit. You didn't get any more Republicans. In fact, you
lost a little ground. What does that mean for your relationship
with Congress?
   A: Hey, listen, it means I didn't do as well as I'd like. And
I'd like to have had more. I still feel that way. I think if you
want to put it in proper perspective, I think everyone is aware of
the fact that the party in power normally loses in an off-year. And
I'm told we did a little better than the norm, but that doesn't
make me happy. I'd like to have more Republicans.
   Q: Well, does it tie your hands now, I mean the fact that. ...
   A: No, it doesn't tie my hands. It has - the changes were very
small. I regret terribly the loss of Senator Boschwitz. He's an
outstanding Republican member of the Senate. But we lose one there.
I don't want to go into a lot of political statistics, but I'm told
that's far fewer than normally happens in an off year.
   And certainly in the House, nine compared to some of the
gloom-and-doom predictions there is not as substantial. But hey
look, everyone that we dropped, I don't like, I don't like to see
us lose seats at all. I'd like to see us gain.
   Yeah, Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, do you have a replacement for Bennett, and do
you have a replacement for Elizabeth Dole as a result of the
election?
   A: Not yet. Not yet, and I haven't even begun to really sit down
seriously with lists. Bill, out of courtesy, whispered in my ear
not so long ago that he wanted to go back to private life. And
maybe I've just been hoping he would think more rationally, but I
understand that. I love his family. And it is right for him and his
family. And somehow I think that's going to prove to be right for
me and this administration in the long run.
   But I have no - but we've got to start soon on that, Helen. And
we haven't - I wanted to wait till after the election, keep my
focus on the campaign trail and then on these big problems we're
wrestling with halfway around the world. But we - so I'm not
misleading you. I've heard a lot of names floated, but we're not
down to the decision-making point on either of these two, or. ...
   Q: Well, will it be a woman, and will it be. ...
   A: Well, as I say, we're not there yet, so I can't help you.
Nice try, however. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, a couple of months ago, predictions were that
Republicans might actually make gains in the mid-term election. ...
   A: Hey, listen, that's what I wanted. ...
   Q: Their fortune seemed to turn when you changed your mind on
the possibility of new taxes and then during the drawn-out budget
process. To what extent do you blame yourself, if at all, for the
Republican showing in this past election?
   A: Well, I think if the past year were significantly different
than other years, in other words, if we'd taken a bath - for every
year, off year heretofore people had gained - the party in power -
I think maybe I would have had to accept a little more
responsibility and blame. I'm not talking victory because I am very
disappointed the way some of the races turned out.
   And I - on the other hand, when you look overall, I think most
people that understand American politics are saying, ``This
administration did not come out worse than predecessors.'' Indeed,
some make the point that we came out a little better. So it's
pretty hard to assess that.
   And I haven't looked at it in terms of those who supported the
budget package, whether they did worse than others. But I made very
clear to the American people I was concerned with some of the
provisions in the budget package. I happen to believe in the long
run it's going to prove in the best interests of this country. And
so I'm not suggesting that that was popular or made me popular with
everybody. But I can't really answer it till we see a little more
analysis. You've asked a very technical question in a sense.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, are you running for re-election in 1992?
   A: Ann, I'm going to put you down as one of the first I'll let
know when I make that decision. No decision has been made.
   You all go through this kind of coy dance now for a while. The
minute the election is over everybody shifts gear and starts
pointing at '92. It's understandable. So therefore, I understand
where you're coming from, but I can't give you an answer yet.

<TEXT>
   Q: Are you giving any consideration to not running? Is that a
possibility?
   A: Not today. Not today. I'm shifting gears now and trying to
shift into the role of trying to lead this country in getting
things done. And we're going to have a good agenda to take to the
Congress. And clearly, I want to see the country remain united in
our determination to succeed halfway around the world. So I really
have not started a focus on '92.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, some of the polling taken in conjunction with
the election, exit polls and so forth, showed an impression growing
in the country that the United States is headed for war in the
Middle East and very serious economic problems here at home. Would
you address those fears?
   A: Well, I'm concerned about the economic situation. I've been
very frank about that. I will be meeting with our top economic
people in the next few days, a series of meetings, both inside -
top economic people in the White House and then I'll be inviting
some others in to talk about it, because I am concerned about a
slowdown in this economy.
   And I'm concerned what that means to the average working man in
this country and the women that are - work with their kids, having
to support them. I mean, it's a terrible worry that people have and
I'd like - we've been enjoying rather robust growth for many years
and now we all know the economy is slower. So I want to be sure
that to the degree a president can do something to soften the blow
or to stimulate economic growth that he tries to do it. So we'll be
having a lot of discussion about that. And what was your part on
the gulf?
   Q: About the prospects forwar in the Persian Gulf.
   A: Well, I've been very clear that we want to see the sanctions
be so successful that we don't have to have anybody shooting over
there. And I've also said we're not ruling any options out.
   Yeah?
   Q: Sir, are you getting a lot of free advice on which way to go
for the next couple of years?
   A: Yes.
   Q: Mr. Viguerie and Howard Phillips are telling you you've got
to go right and reestablish your conservative credentials; Marlin
did remind us yesterday that you are a conservative. But people
like Ed Rollins are saying you've got to be more broad-based and go
after the Democrats. Which way do you - what do you see now? Have
you got to appeal to a wider section, and have you got to go after
blacks again after the veto of the civil rights bill?
   A: Well, one of the things that - since you raised the civil
rights bill - is that I want to have a good civil rights bill. And
so, we'll be sending one up early on. It will not have quotas; it
will not lead to quotas. It will be fair play in trying to
eliminate discrimination in the workplace.
   And there were some politics involved in that, John. We sent a
bill up there that was a very good bill, and the leaders wouldn't
even permit it to be voted on because they thought they could stick
me with being anti-civil rights. I am pro-civil rights. I am
pro-fairness in the workplace, against discrimination in the
workplace.
   And we can fashion that kind of civil rights legislation if we
can get some of the politics out of it. And maybe we can as we
start a new Congress, because I've got a good record in that
regard. I have not changed in that regard, but I don't think it is
fair to recommend to the American people legislation that in my
view would inevitably result in quotas. But now we're out of the
political give-and-take on that, and I think maybe we can get
something positive done.
   Q: Can I ask you about that reaching out in a broad-based way,
and would you reach out to Ed Rollins? Are you willing to work with
him and let him stay on?
   A: All right, look. I'm not going to get into this ``Beltway''
stuff. One of the things that I loved was outside - you know, I got
needled by some - let's see if I can find him or her here- writer
about saying, ``It's nice to be outside of the Beltway.'' It is. I
didn't get one single question about the future of any individual
consultant or member of whatever congressional or Senate committee
or national committee. We stayed on different subjects. So, yes,
we're here, but I'm not - my mind is out there. So I refuse to get
into all of that.
   Yes, Ann.
   Q: Mr. President, as you approach the new Congress, do you think
you will be able to extend the hand of friendship the way you - the
tone of the first, your first inaugural? Or do you think this will
be partisan and confrontational from the outset?
   A: Well, it takes two to - when you extend the hand, somebody
else has to reach out and shake it. And we've been through a highly
partisan political dance here for a while. It's the great American
way. And those with whom I have worked cooperatively, needless to
say, went out and tried to bash the president. And we've heard all
kinds of rhetoric about how I should be doing things differently.
   But look, there are going to be certain things where we will
continue to try to work with the Congress. I also will be doing,
you know, being sure I can do the best job I can in leading a
united Republican Party. We have some - he mentioned a couple of
critics that aren't in the Congress or anything, who - there's
nothing I can do to placate those who have been some of the
severest critics of Ronald Reagan even. So I'm not going to even
worry about that.
   But I do think that it's worth trying to move the country
forward. And on some areas, we're going to have to do it. And on
some I'm going to be appealing strongly for Democratic support, and
in some I'm going to use the veto so as to stop a lot of bad things
from happening to this country. And that veto power is there, and I
am more determined than ever to use it.

<HEAD>Now The Hard Part - Who Gets Squeezed Out In Redistricting?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Reps. Chuck Schumer and Stephen
Solarz won re-election with 80 percent of the vote, but they might
already be thinking about their next jobs.
   Redistricting could put them out of work in 1992.
   The once-a-decade debate now begins to get personal: 19 House
districts need to be erased in 13 states that lost population in
the 1980s.
   In the big-ego, ambition-filled world of politics, that won't be
easy.
   The decisions will be made next year, in most cases by state
legislatures. If history is any guide, members of Congress who
could be affected by the plans will have considerable input, in
person and through contributions to state lawmakers who draft the
plans.
   ``The thing we fear most is being thrown into a district with
another colleague,'' Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said last year. ``We
are at the tender mercy of those whose agendas are not necessarily
our own.''
   In most states losing seats, including all losing more than one,
power of redistricting is shared between Democrats and Republicans.
That generally means the losses, or at least the risk of losses,
will be shared, too.
   Because available census data - ostensibly the guide for
redistricting - is preliminary and the process so complex, it's
difficult to say with any certainty who will be squeezed out or
forced into a race with another incumbent. And retirements or bids
for other office would affect the outcome.
   Here is a state-by-state look at early speculation among
consultants for both parties:
   -New York (-3): A Republican district upstate likely will be
eliminated, probably Rep. Bill Paxon's. And two districts in New
York City are vulnerable, leading to speculation that Brooklyn
districts represented by Schumer and Solarz could be merged.
   But the possibilities arenearly endless in the 20-district
city.
   Queens Democrat James Scheuer will be 72 in 1992 and could
retire or be squeezed out. Democrats Schumer or Solarz might
challenge Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
   If retirements, ambition or other developments don't make the
third cut clear, Republican Bill Green and Democrat Ted Weiss might
find themselves in the same district.
   -Pennsylvania (-2): The Pittsburgh and Philadelphia areas each
will lose a seat. Several members of the delegation are in their
mid-60s, so retirements are possible.
   Otherwise, Democrat Joseph Kolter's district might be carved up
in the west and a Republican incumbent, perhaps Curt Weldon, pitted
against a Democratic incumbent, maybe Thomas Foglietta, in the
Philadelphia suburbs.
   -Ohio (-2): A Cleveland-area Democrat, maybe Edward Feighan, and
a downstate Republican are vulnerable. Republicans Clarence Miller
and Chalmers Wylie could retire.
   -Illinois (-2): The Chicago-area seat to be lost is likely to be
Dan Rostenkowski or Sidney Yates.
   If Rostenkowski retires in 1992, he's eligible to keep $1
million in campaign money. And Yates, who will have been in
Congress for 42 years, will be 83 and could call it quits.
   The other seat will come from Republican country in the north.
   -Michigan (-2): Republican William Broomfield will be 70 in two
years and might retire. If not, he could end up in a race against
fellow Republican Carl Pursell.
   The other seat likely will come from the Democratic Detroit
area.
   -Massachusetts (-1): Unless Republican Silvio Conte or Democrat
Joe Early retires, a Democrat will be squeezed, perhaps into a race
against Rep. Joseph Kennedy.
   The prime candidates are Chester Atkins and Ed Markey, both of
whom have enemies in the state legislature. Controversial Barney
Frank is another possibility.
   -New Jersey (-1): Democrats control the pen, so newly elected
Republican Rep. Richard Zimmer could be in trouble. But his won't
be the easiest district to draw out.
   -Kentucky (-1): Democrats will draw the lines. Republican Rep.
Larry Hopkins looks like the odd man out, forced either to run
against a GOP colleague or for another office if he wants to stay
in politics.
   -West Virginia (-1): Democrats control the process but all four
House members are Democrats. One will be squeezed out, probably
either Alan Mollohan and Harley Staggers.
   -Louisiana (-1): Democrats control the process, which likely
means bad news for one of the delegation's four Republicans.
   -Kansas (-1): Democrat Jim Slattery was the odds-on favorite to
go until Democrats took the governor's office and state House from
GOP hands.
   He could still end up in a race against a Republican colleague,
but with better odds.
   -Iowa (-1): Republicans have a say, but the population losses in
the western part of the state might force GOP Reps. Jim Ross
Lightfoot and Fred Grandy into the same district anyway.
   -Montana (-1): The state goes from two seats to one, forcing
Democrat Pat Williams against Republican Ron Marlenee unless one
bows out.

   I was elected to take this country in a certain direction, and
the liberals in the Congress want to take it in another direction.
So our system decrees who wins, how are we going to move it. And
they're going to shoot stuff back at me over and over again that I
cannot accept. Now, will I try to avoid that? Will I say to them on
the civil rights bill, ``Look, I want civil rights and I don't want
quotas; you tried it your way, now let's give me a vote my way''?
Absolutely. I have to do that. That's part of my responsibility.
   All kinds of growth incentives. When the economy is slow, you
want growth incentives. And so, I've got an agenda. We're going to
be fashioning it. And whether they are going to, you know, be
willing to cooperate, I don't know. But it's hard when you have a
majority - take capital gains. There was a majority last year in
the House for it; there was a majority last year in the Senate for
it. It never could get voted on. Now, I think the American people
can see that, and so, let's hope we can make progress on some of
these incentives. When you have a slow economy or the worry about a
slower economy, that's a good time to put incentive into the
economic spectrum.
   Yeah, Frank?
   Q: Mr. President, CNN has obtained tapes which apparently were
recorded between Manuel Noriega in prison and his defense team.
Now, while certain calls are permitted to be monitored, we
understand that those with a defendant's attorneys are supposed to
be privileged. Were you aware of this monitoring or any specific
order that would have authorized monitoring of privileged
conversations?
   A: No, and I'm not aware of it now; you're - I'm learning
something from you. So I'm not going to comment on it if I don't
know anything about it, and I don't.
   Q: Under what circumstances would you favor monitoring?
   A: I would favor abiding by the law.
   Q: Mr. President, with all of your explanations on mid-term
perspective taken as a given, do you think you paid a political
price for compromising with the Democrats and agreeing to new
taxes?
   A: I don't know, because I used to get accused in this very room
- by question, not direct accusation - but by living and guiding
myself by the polls. That was when they: ``Hey, you won't make a
tough decision because of the polls.'' I've not heard that
recently, and maybe that has something to do with how I'd answer
your question, because I don't think it was popular, what I did,
with anybody.
   But I think it was the right thing to do. And so I will try to
make that point, and I, you know, you just, like the umpire, you've
got to call them as you see them. And so I have some remedial work
to do, I think, and I can't - I wish I could go back and give a
clearer answer to whether this helped or hurt in the election,
because I just don't know the answer to that. But it's - I think in
the final analysis, if it's good for the economy long-run - we're
in some tough times right now - but in the long run, if it's good
for the economy, then that should be good for the country. And if
it's good for the country, now, hopefully it would be good for the
views that I represent.
   Q: I asked that because so many of the governors on the
Democratic side and your own side seem to have certainly been
punished where they raised taxes, and I wonder if that's a lesson
you take away from this election?
   A: Well, I think there is a lesson. I think people feel they're
taxed too much. I happen to believe that, and I've said that. And I
haven't changed my view that we ought to go out and raise people -
and think we ought to go out and raise people's taxes.
   What I think we're going to see coming down the pike at me, in
terms of the offered hand, is a whole wide array of tax proposals
out of the Democrats. Maybe I misread what some of their leaders
said when they talked about now going back and trying to raise
income tax rates. And they're going to do it over my dead veto - or
live veto, or something like that - because it ain't going to
happen, I'll guarantee you. And so I can identify with that. I've
always felt that way. I made one compromise to try to get a budget
agreement that, in my view, I felt was essential. And I don't - I
got the message - I had the message long before America went to the
polls to say, ``Hey, we don't want any more taxes. We want to do
something about spending.''
   And one of the great things about this budget agreement is that
there's some enforcement provisions in here that I am determined to
live by, and that I am determined to make Congress live by. And if
we live by them, then we can negate the insatiable desire on the
part of some in the Congress on the Democratic side to raise taxes.
   But the good news on that, Wyatt, is I think some of the
Democrats got the message, as well as Republicans. We've had the
message. We've understood this. And you're right, they spoke up
against governors, some Democrats, some Republican. But I don't
think there's any confusion on the part of people as to how I feel
about taxes. I oppose raising taxes. And we had this one compromise
and that just reinforced my view, frankly.

<HEAD>Chess Fans: The Quietest Sport Fanatics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN MATTHEWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the varied breeds of sports fanatics,
chess enthusiasts are the quietest. They have to sit on their
hands. They can't stand up to order a hot dog or step out to buy a
beer.
   And they definitely can't shout armchair suggestions like
``exd4'' or ``Bf6'' during a match.
   The U.S. Open at Flushing Meadows was downright raucous compared
to the inside of the Hudson Theatre where Garry Kasparov and
Anatoly Karpov played to a draw in their last stateside game
Wednesday of the current championship.
   The dueling chess mavens leave New York to begin the second half
of theirchampionship match in Lyons, France, tied 6-6. Each player
won one game in New York; the 10 others ended in draws.
   The second half of the championship resumes Nov. 24. The first
player to gain 12{ points wins. If tied after 24 games, Kasparov
keeps his title.
   As for stage presence, Kasparov and Karpov are no McEnroe and
Connors.
   There was no Hulk Hogan-Iron Sheik-like dialogue between these
two sworn enemies, and certainly no tantrums. Most of the time they
didn't even stay on stage together. As one pondered his move, the
other waited off stage.
   Nobody slam-dunked any chess pieces to the ground or sent an
errant queen spiraling across the stage.
   But that's not to say the sport lacks excitement. On Wednesday,
after move number 31, politeness and solitude took a back seat to
hurriedness.
   Because of time constraint rules, Karpov was left with only nine
minutes to make his next nine moves while Kasparov had 20 minutes
left for the same number of moves. For this, both sat at the table.
   And while there were no lavish tailgate parties or interruptions
as mutinous fans were escorted out, there was a certain
fairytale-like ambiance.
   When not straining to see the taut expressions on the player's
faces, fans - who paid between $25 and $100 per ticket - could
focus on the giant cutout chess pieces that looked like they came
straight out of Lewis Carroll's ``Through the Looking Glass.''
   One thing there's plenty of is quiet.
   These fans would likely be out of place in the blue seats at
Madison Square Garden or at any New York Jet football game, where
rudeness is the prevailing rule.
   Chess folk take their quiet seriously. As they followed Game 12,
spectators would break into an occasional murmur. They were
immediately shushed by neighbors and the words ``Silence Please''
flashed on a giant screen.
   For those fans who can't take the silence, the analysis rooms in
the adjoining Hotel Macklowe offered a diversion. There, chess
buffs followed the game on monitors while grandmasters provided
color commentary.
   ``I think absolutely terrible move by Karpov!'' grandmaster
Roman Dzindzichashvili exploded at one point. ``Absolutely
terrible!''
   ``Do you think he didn't see bishop E6,'' someone shouted.
   ``No, he saw bishop E6,'' Dzindzichashvili said. ``He just
underestimated.''
   If the United States as a whole was not agog with the chess
championship, the Hotel Macklowe, at least, was buzzing with
nothing else.
   In lounges and on elevators, people talked chess in a dozen
languages.
   ``It's exciting to be in a chess milieu,'' said Steve Shapiro of
Manhattan, who watched the final American match with his brother.
   ``When you're playing, you're with a buddy or in a club. Rarely
are you part of a chess scene. There are lots of scenes in this
town, and chess ain't one of them.''

<HEAD>Laotian Family Opts for `American' Baby Name - Ronald Smith</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MASON CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Laotian couple with a 15-letter last
name wanted a shorter, simpler, more American name for their
newborn son.
   So Phouthone and Chanhsy Sichanthongthip (pronounced
sik-en-ton'-tip) chose the name Ronald Smith.
   ``It's too hard here to have a last name that's a long name,''
the baby's father said.
   Sichanthongthip, 23, said his mother, brother and sister all
approved of the name when they visited the hospital in Mason City
on Wednesday. The child was born hours earlier.
   ``They say it's OK. It's good. They like it,'' he said.
   In 1986, Sichanthongthip and his father moved to Forest City, 30
miles northwest of Mason City, after they escaped to Thailand from
Laos. In 1988, they were joined by other family members, who left
Laos with help from a Lutheran church.
   Chanhsy Sichanthongthip said her husband was looking through a
book of baby names when he came up with the idea of an American
name. Ronald's last name will be Smith rather than Sichanthongthip.
   ``He wanted the baby different because he was born in the United
States,'' she said.

<HEAD>Analysts: Saddam Sacked Military Chief Over Kuwait Opposition</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein has dismissed his military
chief of staff for opposing the occupation of Kuwait and analysts
said Thursday the move indicated growing dissension in his armed
forces hierarchy.
   The Iraqi army's al-Qadissiya daily reported Thursday that Lt.
Gen. Nazir al-Khazraji, chief of staff since 1985, was replaced by
Gen. Hussein Rashid, commander of the elite 120,000-strong
Republican Guards force.
   The newspaper did not say what happened to Khazraji or when he
was dismissed.
   But several Western military and intelligence sources said
Khazraji opposed the Kuwait occupation. They also believe Saddam
might be seeking to surround himself with relatives and loyalists
as the standoff with the multinational gulf force enters its fourth
month.
   A Western intelligence source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Rashid is a hard-liner in Iraq's Baath Socialist
Party who would be expected to support Saddam's policies. Rashid
had been Khazraji's deputy chief of staff for operations.
   U.S. officials in Washington said Rashid is considered a ``very
competent'' commander and led an armored brigade in the 1980-88 war
against Iran.
   ``It's very ominous,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, a former analyst
with London's International Institute for Strategic Studies who is
now with Control Risks, an international security firm in London.
   ``Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to
Saddam within the military,'' Kopietz said in a telephone
interview.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Khazraji was named a special military adviser to Saddam in what was
seen as a demotion.
   Al-Qadissiya mentioned Rashid's new title in a report of a
graduation ceremony he attended at Baghdad's military academy
Wednesday.
   The shakeup comes amid increasingly tough U.S. and British
warnings they might use force to dislodge the Iraqis from Kuwait.
   ``Saddam's taking a big gamble,'' said analyst Shahram Chubin of
the Geneva-based Graduate Institute of International Affairs and
author of several books on the Gulf War.
   Some analysts said Rashid's appointment was in part designed to
keep the Republican Guards on Saddam's side. The guards, considered
to be Iraq's best troops, led the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The rest of the army may be neutralized. But the Republican
guards could turn against him if he takes the country down the road
to national suicide,'' said Bernard Trainor, a former U.S. Marine
general who has visited Iraq several times.
   ``As he tightens up, he's gathering around him all the
hard-liners and sycophants who are afraid to challenge him,'' said
Trainor, who heads the national security program at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government.
   Rashid is believed to hail from Takrit, Saddam's birthplace
north of Baghdad. Saddam has packed the hierarchy of his ruling
Baath Arab Socialist Party with relatives, by blood or marriage,
who come mainly from Takriti clans.
   Rashid's appointment is the second known top-level change in
Baghdad in the past two weeks.
   Oil Minister Issam Chalabi was fired Oct. 28 and replaced by
Brig. Gen. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's cousin and son-in-law. Kamel is
also Minister of Industry and Military Industrialization and is
believed to head Saddam's internal security apparatus.
   Kamel, a Takriti, has been responsible for developing Iraq's
arms industry and producing new surface-to-surface missiles.
   Chalabi was purportedly replaced after he imposed gasoline
rationing because of shortages due to the U.N. trade embargo. That
order was later rescinded and officials denied there was any
shortage.
   But Kopietz noted: ``There was more to Chalabi's dismissal than
meets the eye. He's a moderate, close to the West and the oil
industry where he was widely respected. He was understood to be
trying to persuade Saddam from pursuing his strategy of
confrontation.''
   ``It may well be that there's growing opposition to Saddam
within the Iraqi hierarchy,'' Kopietz added.
   Chubin noted: ``I'm sure there's considerable disquiet in the
miliary, who're not necessarily all convinced Takriti Baathists.''
   Iraqi dissident groups have reported several purges of senior
officers since the invasion of Kuwait, possibly because they
disagreed with it and Saddam's apparent miscalculation about how
the West would react.
   There has been no independent confirmation of reports that some
officers have been executed or imprisoned. But since Saddam took
power in 1979, he has regularly purged senior officers who he
suspected could pose threats.
   Some have disappeared or died under mysterious circumstances,
including a defense minister, Gen. Adnan Khairallah, Saddam's
cousin and brother-in-law, killed in a 1989 helicopter crash.
   Analysts believe opposition heightened after Saddam, seeking to
secure Iraq's border with Iran as his international isolation
increased, made concessions to Iraq's former foe in Aug. 15.
   The accord freed most of 30 divisions guarding Iraq's eastern
frontier to bolster forces facing the multinational force in the
gulf region.

   Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths says Gov. James
Blanchard lost his job in part because he removed her as a running
mate.
   ``I don't know if I feel vindicated, but I think it clearly
shows that I won it for him the first two times,'' Griffiths said
Wednesday after Republican John Engler defeated Blanchard by 50.4
percent to 49.6 percent.
   In announcing last summer he was dropping her from the ticket,
Blanchard said he was concerned about the 78-year-old Griffiths'
ability to run the state in the event something happened to him.
   ``I feel bad for him, but he took some very bad advice,'' she
said.
   ``I would have gotten out the Detroit vote,'' she said,
referring to the low turnout in Detroit, which analysts said hurt
Blanchard. Griffiths said voters also told her repeatedly they had
planned to vote against Blanchard because he took her off the
ticket.
   Griffiths said Blanchard officials never took her up on an offer
to campaign for the two-term governor.

<HEAD>Lawrence Durrell, Author of `The Alexandria Quartet,' Dead at 78</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawrence Durrell, the British novelist who conveyed
his love for Mediterranean life in ``The Alexandria Quartet'' and
other lyrical works, died at his home in southern France, his
family said Thursday. He was 78.
   The cause of death Wednesday was not disclosed. Durrell had been
fatigued for about two weeks, a family member said, and the author
said in a 1986 interview that he suffered from emphysema.
   ``He was a very odd mixture of things,'' said Philip Howard,
literary editor of The Times of London, in an interview with the
British Broadcasting Corp.
   ``The thing he will be remembered for is the great tetralogy of
novels, `The Alexandria Quartet,' which were all the rage in the
early '60s, and were in many ways the most accessible thing in the
modernist movement,'' Howard said. ``He was a real mixture of
modernist structure and extreme romanticism.''
   ``The Alexandria Quartet'' consists of four novels set in the
Egyptian coastal city where Durrell served as press attache at the
British Embassy in World War II. The works, written from 1957 to
1960, are ``Justine,'' ``Balthazar,'' ``Mountolive'' and ``Clea.''
They brought him the commercial success that had not accompanied
his earlier literary acclaim.
   The series - written in a lush, baroque prose style - took as
its theme love as a means of self-discovery. It is a portrait of an
English writer's life amid the inhabitants of Alexandria.
   ``Classicism means becoming a spokesman for the cosmology of
your time, and what the hell was the cosmology of our age if it
wasn't Einstein and Freud,'' Durrell said in a 1982 interview with
The Associated Press.
   ``So I used the theory of relativity, the four dimensions, as a
kind of point of departure to make a classical frame in four
volumes.''
   Durrell was born in 1912 in central India and spent his boyhood
in Darjeeling, near India's border with Tibet. But it was the
Mediterranean that caught his passion and where he spent his public
and private life.
   At the age of 18, he left India for London, where he dabbled in
jazz and poetry without much success. In 1935, he first encountered
Greece, the inspiration for some of his works.
   Durrell moved to Corfu, an Ionian Island off the west coast of
Greece.
   It was from there that he began a nearly 50-year correspondence
with American author Henry Miller.
   Letters between them were published in two volumes in 1963 and
1988. Durrell described the letters as ``full of of insight, full
of fun.''
   Two years ago, several love letters written by Miller to
Hollywood actress Brenda Venus, part of Durrell's personal papers,
were sold at a London auction.
   Durrell served in Britain's diplomatic corps in Egypt, Greece
and Yugoslavia, and as director of public relations for the British
government in Cyprus.
   Another acclaimed work, ``Bitter Lemons'' published in 1957, was
an account of his years in Cyprus during the island's independence
struggle.
   ``I spent 25 years subsidizing myself by doing jobs I didn't
particularly like, but it was useful in the long run,'' Durrell
said in 1982. ``I made notes. I learned from Stendahl, and by the
time I really wanted to write books I had quite a well-furnished
documentary library in my brain.''
   He wrote ``The Alexandria Quartet'' in Nimes, southeastern
France, and lived for the last 24 years in Sommieres, a nearby
small town in the Provence region near the Mediterranean coast.
   Four years ago he emerged briefly from his self-imposed privacy
to accept an award of Commander of Arts and Letters bestowed by the
local mayor.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said Faber
and Faber will publish a new Durrell book next week, ``Caesar's
Vast Ghost: A Portrait of Provence.'' Matthew Evans, managing
director of Faber and Faber, said: ``What he wanted to do was write
a book which paid tribute to the part of France he lived in for so
very many years.
   ``He knew it was his last book ... and only recently saw the
first copy.''
   Durrell was married three times and hadtwo daughters, according
to Press Association. One wife and one daughter have died, it said.
   No funeral plans were immediately announced.
   His brother, Gerald Malcolm Durrell, who survives, is a
zoologist and popular writer of nature books.

   Here is a breakdown of the opposing forces gathered in the
Persian Gulf. ---
   
   UNITED STATES - Officials say about 230,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the gulf region, and at least 100,000
more could be sent.
   Ground forces in Saudi Arabia include the 82nd ``All American''
Airborne Division; the 101st ``Screaming Eagles'' Airborne
Division; the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, with about 200 M-1
Abrams tanks and 300 Bradley Fighting Vehicles; the 11th Air
Defense Artillery Brigade; 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade; the
1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   Amphibious capability is provided by 45,000 men of the 1st, 4th
and 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigades. There is a Special Forces
contingent from the 1st Special Operations Command.
   
   The U.S. fleet in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and the eastern
Mediterranean totals about 55 ships. They include the aircraft
carriers Independence, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy; the battleship
Wisconsin with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, five missile cruisers,
four destroyers, several frigates, plus supply ships and six to
eight nuclear submarines.
   The aircraft carriers have a combined strike force of 180 A-6
Intruder fighters, F/A-18 Hornet fighters and F-14 Tomcats. The
Marines have about 60 AV-8B Harrier jump-jets.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter-bombers to
unspecified bases; 14 long-range F-111F bombers to Incirlik airbase
in southwest Turkey, and another squadron to Spain.
   There are an estimated 150 F-16s and F-15s; more than 70 A-10
tank-killing Thunderbolts, and unspecified numbers of F-4 Wild
Weasel air-defense suppression jets and other combat aircraft
deployed at 30 airbases in the region.
   A squadron of 6-8 B-52G strategic bombers is on the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia.
   ---
   BRITAIN - A three-ship flotilla permanently stationed in the
gulf has been beefed up to 12 ships, including a missile destroyer,
two missile frigates and three minesweepers. They have support
ships.
   Four squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors and ground
attack jets are in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Three Nimrod
maritime reconnaissance aircraft are in Oman.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, successors to the famous ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, have started arriving with 120 Challenger
tanks and 9,500 troops in Britain's biggest military operation
since the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina. British troop
strength is expected to reach 15,000.
   ---
   FRANCE - It has about 14 ships and 13,000 troops in the gulf
region. The warships include a guided-missile cruiser, two missile
destroyers, two frigates and one corvette with support vessels.
   France is sending three squadrons of interceptors and
fighter-bombers. The 4,000-troop Rapid Action Force is deployed
with Arab forces in Saudi Arabia's northeastern desert. It includes
the 5th Combat Helicopter Regiment with 42 gunships; the Foreign
Legion's 3nd Infantry Regiment with anti-tank missiles; the 1st
Spahis Cavalry Regiment with armored vehicles, and an anti-aircraft
missile unit.
   A company of 190 paratroopers equipped for chemical warfare is
in the United Arab Emirates.
   The French deployment is the nation's biggest overseas operation
since the Algerian war in the early 1960s.
   ---
   ITALY - The frigates Libeccio, Orsa and Zeffiro and a support
ship, the Stromboli, are in the gulf. The corvettes Minerva and
Stinge are in the eastern Mediterranean replacing U.S. units
assigned to the gulf.
   A squadron of eight Tornado fighters is based near Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates, to provide air cover for Italian warships. No
ground force deployment is planned.
   ---
   CANADA - The destroyers Athabaskan and Terra Nova and the supply
ship Protecteur are heading for the gulf. A squadron of 18 CF-18
fighter jets and 450 military personnel based in West Germany are
in Saudi Arabia.
   ---
   NETHERLANDS - The frigates Witte de With and Pieter Florisz are
in the Gulf of Oman. The combat supply ship Zuiderkruis is expected
there in November.

100-man army unit will also be sent.
   ---
   SOVIET UNION - The Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Tributs and an
anti-submarine ship are in the Gulf of Oman. Moscow has indicated
it would send ground forces, but only under U.N. command. The
Slava-class missile cruiser Chervona Ukraina and the
Sovremenny-class destroyer Bystry passed through the Suez Canal
Oct.4, ostensibly en route to join the Soviet Pacific Fleet. But
they could be deployed in the gulf region.
   ---
   GREECE - Greece has sent its most advanced frigate, the Limnos,
to the eastern Mediterranean. Greece is supplying merchant ships
for the U.S. sealift.
   ---
   WEST GERMANY - It is providing merchant ships to transport U.S.
troops to Saudi Arabia and has provided $2 billion toward the
multinational force. Germany's Constitution prohibits it from
sending military forces outside its borders.

   GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and, until Aug. 2, Kuwait) - A rapid
deployment force of up to 10,000 troops is based at Hafr al-Batin,
Saudi Arabia, 40 miles south of the Kuwait border. They and allied
Arab-Islamic forces form the first line of defense.
   The GCC force has been beefed up with about 7,000 soldiers of
Kuwait's 20,000-man army who escaped their country when Iraq
invaded. Most of their heavy weapons were captured by Iraq, but
some combat jets and tanks were saved. The GCC and other Gulf Arab
forces total around 144,500 men, 330 combat aircraft, 800 tanks and
36 major naval units.
   They are supported by:
   EGYPT - It has pledged up to 20,000 troops with tanks and heavy
artillery. About 14,000 troops - including paratroopers, commandos,
chemical warfare specialists and infantry - are in Saudi Arabia.
Several thousand more soldiers from the 3rd Armored Division and
the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division, are expected soon. Five
hundred troops are in the United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   SYRIA - About 6,500 troops, mostly elite Special Forces units
who have fought the Israelis and others in Lebanon, are in Saudi
Arabia. A 15,000-man armored division, with about 420 tanks and
heavy artillery, is also arriving. Some troops are based in the
United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   PAKISTAN - It has pledged to send 5,000 troops, with 2,000
already in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 in the United Arab Emirates,
along with 1,000 advisers. About 5,000 advisers are already
attached to the Saudi armed forces.
   ---
   MOROCCO - It has 1,200 troops in Saudi Arabia and 500 in the
United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   BANGLADESH - It has 2,000 troops, including engineering and
infantry units, in Saudi Arabia.
   ---
   IRAQ - The army has seven corps totaling 55 divisions. There are
555,000 regular troops and 480,000 reserves. Regular forces include
seven divisions of elite Republican Guards.
   Iraq claims a militia called the Popular Army has 5 million men.
   Saddam Hussein has 5,500 tanks, including about 500 high-quality
T-72s and 1,000 medium-quality T-62s; 3,500 artillery guns; 200
multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; 500-plus combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors. The equipment is spread around an estimated 25
airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divisions, four of them
armored, totaling 170,000 troops; 3,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks, and
1,700 artillery pieces in what appear to be defensive positions.
   About 250,000 men, including the seven Republican Guard
divisions with up to 1,300 tanks and 750 guns, are in southern Iraq
as a tactical reserve. Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to
have been deployed to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in
Kuwait. FROG-7 battlefield missiles have also been deployed,
including batteries captured in Kuwait.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: view, frankly.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: If I may, are you saying it's one time only?
   A: I'm just saying I'm going to hold the line on taxes and fight
back all these plans that are coming at me that I think will -
maybe I'm getting paranoid about it when I hear them talk about,
let's go out and raise taxes again, but I thought that was kind of
the message coming out of the end of the budget debate. And if
that's the case, we're in for a whale of a fight, and the proffered
hand may miss the shake because we're not going to compromise on
that.
   Q: Sir, can we go back out beyond the Beltway again for a
minute?
   A: Let's do it, Michelle.
   Q: A couple of years ago the Texas Republican party passed an
English-only amendment as part of its party platform, and you spoke
out against this. You said that this was an alienating message to
send to people you want to participate. This year, the North
Carolina Republican party sent postcards to minority voters,
Democrats, suggesting that they had given false information to
elections officials, giving them false information. Is this an
appropriate campaign tactic, and why have you been silent about
this?
   A: I have - because I haven't tried to get into the campaign
tactics in 50 states. And on the postcard -I mean the English-only,
I don't think it's a good thing to have. I mean, I want every kid
to speak English. I've been for bilingual education all my life,
continue to support it. But I think the goal of it should be that
every kid in this country speak English. But I just don't think the
English-only approach is the way to do it. I think it could result
in certain discrimination.
   But I'm sorry, I can't help you on the details of a race for the
United States Senate or a governor's race or a congressional race.
I just have not gone into that.
   Q: Sir, are you saying that you don't know anything about this.
...
   A: I read a lot of charges and countercharges, and I've heard
some people say it's bad and I've heard others say it's not. And I
do recall that some time, any time somebody puts in what they call
a voter security program, some people raise hell about it, and
that's not right either. So, it ought to be - it depends how it's
done. And I just don't know enough about what you're trying to get
me into to get into that.
   Yeah?
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, I wonder if you've had any reaction to
the margins of victory of Mario Cuomo and Bill Bradley, two
Democrats thought to be looking at challenging you in two years?
   A: I'm not thinking about '92.
   Q: Let's talk about races.
   Q: What do you think happened?
   A: Look, I just told Michelle, I haven't gone into the details
of all these races. I don't know, I don't know.
   A: Why haven't you?
   Q: I want to ask you about Director Bennett. We've heard stories
of threats against himself, against his family, and maybe that's
why he's leaving. What do you know about that?
   A: Well, I'd let him respond to that question. But I - maybe
Bill, why don't you.
   Bennett: I got one question. Come on, let me take it.
   So far I've read tat I am bored, restive, restless, tired,
unhappy, moping about lack of media attention, sulking about not
being in the Cabinet, in a snit with John Sununu - all sorts of
things that I've read about - and being stampeded out of town, none
of which are true. I mean, I - there have been people who haven't
liked me since I have been in public service. The Yale English
Department, they may be threatening - I don't - the National
Education Association and, you know, and this latest crowd. But, I
mean, I'm not the stampeded-out-of-town type. There's nothing
there.
   Q: How about threats?
   Bennett: Oh, I mean there are threats, there are always threats
in this kind of. ... They've been there since the beginning of this
job. I mean, that's always the case. I think what people are
picking up on is when I went up to Alaska to talk about the
recriminalization of marijuana - which by the way occurred, that
took place, that initiative passed - there were some anonymous
threats from some potheads that they were going to blow me up. But
they - but the notice that went out from the - one of the pothead
societies said, ``Come confront Bennett,'' but the date they put on
it was two days after the day I was there. So if they did leave
anything dangerous, it's probably going off up there on the icecaps
somewhere without any. ...
   Q: Why are you leaving?
   Bennett (to Bush): I don't want to tie you up; should we go into
this?
   Bush: No, no, I'm going to just take two more and then I'm
leaving.
   Bennett: When the president and I talked 20 months ago, we
talked about things that needed to be done. I'd had two jobs in
government, humanities chairman and secretary of education. And we
decided that what we needed to do was to get a good strategy, which
we've got; to get bipartisan support for it, which we've got,
broadly - there are still some things Democrats need to do, like
the crime bill; third, that we needed to get the right amount of
resources for it, which we've achieved, and fourth, to begin to see
some progress, some results. And we said at that time, I remember
the president saying to me, ``If you can get this thing started,
going in the right direction, moving, I'll be very grateful.'' And
I think we got that. And so I'm, you know, I took the job freely
and now I leave freely.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: leave freely.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Why don't you want to see it through?
   Bennett: Well, I, seeing it through is going to, I mean, I think
if this nation stays on course, I think it's probably, we will
probably beat the goals that we stated in the National Drug Control
Strategy of 10 years. I think we'll be there in five years if the
states do the things that they're supposed to do, and if others do
what they're supposed to do.
   The federal commitment, I think, is clear; unprecedented
commitment, unprecedented amount of money, resources, and so on.
That's five years. That's, you know, I've had nine years in
government. I think that's enough for now. I mean I do want to tell
my critics I am not leaving public life, and worse than that, I may
not even be leaving public service forever. I may not, you know, I
may be back. One needs to be careful about this. But I don't leave
with any sense of remorse or apology. I'm proud of what we've done,
and I think what we've done is a good thing. And we really are
making progress.
   Bush: With your permission, let me just take two; Jessica and
Ellen. ... Yes, Ellen?
   Q: Mr. President, you say that your reading of the election
shows that people didn't and don't want their taxes raised. Upon
reflection, do you wish you had kept your campaign promise and not
supported higher taxes?
   A: Do I wish I'd been able to? Yes, very much so. In fact, we
tried. We sent a budget up there and it kind of died for lack of a
second. And it had no taxes in it. And that's - I very - I wish I
had a Congress that would do
   it just my way, because I am still convinced we can get by
without having raised anybody's taxes of any kind. And so, yes, I
have serious regrets about that.
   Q: Well, can you make the promise now, sir, that you will not
support new taxes in the future?
   A: Can I make the promise I won't support them? Absolutely. But
I'm - you know, sometimes you run into some realities. But I'm
girding up my loins to go into battle to beat back the tax attempts
that I think are coming. Because I think the American people are
fed up with it. And I think that was very clear.
   I think in my case they probably know that there had to be some
compromise, at least from the way you look at does the American
people support the deficit agreement or not. But I want to be on
theside of no tax increases, and we're going to go right to bat
again in the Congress at that. We fight that battle all the time.
Yes, Jessica?
   Q: Mr. President, there seemed to be not very much debate about
the Persian Gulf during the election, even though we have our young
people there and their lives are on the line. I'm wondering, do you
take this - the fact that you weren't seriously challenged by the
opposition party on this matter - do you take this as support for
any decision that you might make, with respect to having to go to
war there, without respect, say, to the House's adjournment
resolution that said they should come back if you go to war.
   A: Jessica, look, I said I didn't want to take any Persian Gulf
questions. ... I will reply to this, and then ask - and it is the
last one anyway - but I - look, we have had extensive consultations
with Congress. We will continue to have extensive consultations
with Congress. I think the people in the campaign for the most part
recognized that I was trying very hard to separate support for the
Persian Gulf policy from the pure head-on-head confrontation of
domestic politics.
   And again, I tried continually on the road to salute the
Democratic leadership and Democratic members, along with Republican
leadership and Republican members, for what I think has been
extraordinarily solid support. And I think that support has led to
good support from the American people. But we have a major foreign
policy objective there. I am determined to see the objective
fulfilled. I am determined to hold this coalition together. But
that must be done without partisan politics intervening. And so
that then leads me to say I will continue to consult.
   I know the responsibilities I have to do that. I know the
importance of the support of the Congress, and I will continue to
reach out to them and keep them informed and consult. And they know
my views. So I don't think there's any - I don't think that the
campaign has driven any wedge between me and the leaders on Capitol
Hill or the American people on this very important problem.
   Q: So that does mean that you feel that there is widespread
national support for whatever it is that you have to do, that you
decide to do?
   A: No question about it.
   Q: Well, I like to feel the American people would support their
president on whatever decision is made. And I think one way to
guarantee that is to be sure that you consult, to be sure that you
spell out your objectives as clearly as possible, to be sure you
keep this historic coalition together. And the importance of the
Baker trip, for example, I think is obvious. And so, so far, I
think that the ingredients are there for full support. And I view
my responsibilities as such that I must be sure that's right. I'll
go the extra mile, here at home and abroad, to see that we, that
our, the common objectives as stated by the United Nations are met.
   I'll turn it over to Bill. And let me just say, I've read some
silly speculation about Bill Bennett's leaving. And he has my total
confidence. There's no internal politics that's caused him to make
this decision. If he feels like it, he can tell you when he - I
don't want to violate confidences - when he and I had our first and
then subsequent talks about this. He knows the affection that
Barbara and I have for him and his family.
   I know that the kind of sacrifice that anyone serving this
country goes through, not just in the controversy of the job but in
terms of financial aspirations for their families that need to be
educated. And so please discount some of this understandable
speculation. He has my confidence. I think I have his, and I know
that he has the love and affection or his family from Barbara and
me. And I think he's done an outstanding job for his country. And
even his severest critics, I think, will tell you that, those that
started off the most critical. We've made progress in an area that
is vital to every single family in this country. And I will never
get over being grateful to Bill Bennett for what he's done.
   Bennett: Thank you very much.
   Bush: Good luck.

   A protective blanket over part of an
astronomical observatory aboard the space shuttle Columbia was torn
when a worker accidentally knocked a metal pan into it, NASA said
Thursday.
   The mishap was not expected to affect Columbia's astronomy
mission, targeted for early December, said NASA spokeswoman Pat
Phillips.
   The accident occurred Wednesday as the worker was moving a
platform that provides access to Columbia's cargo bay, she said.
   The aluminum pan, located beneath the platform to catch debris,
nicked the blanket and left a hole about one-fourth of an inch long
and one-eighth of an inch wide, Phillips said.
   The blanket covers the Astro observatory's star tracker, used by
the three ultraviolet telescopes that constitute the observatory to
locate and lock onto stars.
   ``We don't think anything happened'' to the star tracker,
Phillips said.
   The worker responsible for the accident is employed by Lockheed
Space Operations Co., NASA's prime contractor for shuttle
processing. Lockheed spokesman J.B. Kump said the company was
investigating.
   NASA officials reported Wednesday that a special team assigned
to look into similar accidents over the past year could find no
connecting link. The most embarrassing mishap - a beam that was
left rattling loose inside Atlantis' engine compartment last month
while the vehicle was being moved - also was caused by Lockheed
employees.

   Rescue workers on Thursday found wreckage
from a missing U.S. Army helicopter that crashed in the Saronic
Gulf, but continued searching for the remains of the three crewmen,
the U.S. Embassy said.
   The rescue team said the state of the wreckage and human remains
discovered at the site suggested it was unlikely that any of the
crewmen had survived.
   The UH-1H Huey helicopter was on a routine flight from the
Army's Southern European Task Force base in Vicenza, Italy, when it
crashed Wednesday evening near the islet of Evreos, 12 miles
southeast of Corinth, an embassy official said.
   The helicopter's destination was the Air Force's Hellenikon
base, adjacent to Athens International Airport.
   The crewmen were identified as Chief Warrant Officer James
Harbeson, 37, of South Carolina; Chief Warrant Officer Manuel
Gomez, 29, of Camden, N.J.; and Sgt. Michael Chandler, 23, of San
Antonio, Texas.
   He had no hometown for Harbeson. All three men were part of the
Sixth Aviation Detachment.
   Greek military aircraft and ships continued to search the crash
site late Thursday.
   The semi-official Athens News Agency said prior to the crash the
helicopter had landed at a small Greek islet near Corfu in
northwestern Greece because of mechanical problems. It continued
its flight after repairs were made, the agency said.

   President Bush, reviving the no-new-tax pledge
he abandoned in a budget deal, said Thursday the only way Democrats
will be able to raise income tax rates will be ``over my dead
veto.''
   ``It ain't going to happen, I'll guarantee you,'' Bush told
reporters at a news conference after saying he expects
congressional Democrats to come up with new tax proposals.
   But he hedged his pledge somewhat when asked flatly if he would
reject new taxes.
   ``Can I make the promise I won't support them? Absolutely,''
Bush said. ``But ... sometimes you run into some realities. But I'm
girding up my loins to go into battle to beat back the tax attempts
that I think are coming.''
   He said Democrats had an ``insatiable desire'' to raise taxes
and accused them of trying to ``stick me with being anti-civil
rights'' for vetoing a landmark bill banning job discrimination.
   Bush struck a sharply combative stance toward the Democrats, who
increased their power in both the House and Senate with Election
Day victories.
   ``I didn't do as well as I'd like,'' the president said,
reflecting on Tuesday's GOP losses.
   Bush said the clear message from Election Day was that ``people
feel they're taxed too much.''
   Six incumbent governors, of both parties, went down to defeat.
The losses generally reflected tax or economic woes.
   Bush, in one of his gloomiest assessments, said he was very
concerned that the economy was faltering. He said he would consult
with economists in and out of the government on ways to soften the
blow and stimulate growth.
   ``We're in some tough times right now,'' the president said.
   Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, told a business
group Thursday that he wouldn't rule out a possible negative
quarter of economic growth either in the final three months of this
year or early next year.
   He didn't specifically forecast a recession, but said there was
no doubt economic growth was weak.
   ``The economy at best is in a lull, but we do expect that lull
to be relatively brief and relatively minor,'' Boskin said.
   Even before the election, Republicans were heavily outnumbered
in Congress, and their losses Tuesday will make it harder for Bush
to win veto battles and push a legislative agenda.
   But Bush said the results won't ``tie my hands at all'' in
dealing with lawmakers, signaling that he would be less
conciliatory in the next two years.
   ``When you extend the hand (of cooperation), somebody else has
to reach out and shake it,'' Bush said.
   He said he would appeal for Democratic support for his policies,
but warned:
   ``I'm going to use the veto so as to stop a lot of bad things
from happening to this country. ... I am more determined than ever
to use it.''
   Bush abandoned his politically popular no-new-tax pledge during
negotiations with Congress to reduce the massive budget deficits.
To the dismay of many Republicans, the deal Bush approved for
fiscal 1991 includes $140 billion in new taxes.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Wednesday there's
support among Democrats for a surtax on millionaires, one of the
provisions omitted from the budget deal.
   Bush said that if Democrats want higher taxes, ``we're in for a
whale of a fight and the proffered hand (of conciliation) may miss
the shake because we're not going to compromise on that.''
   ``What I think we're going to see comng down the pike at me ...
is a whole wide array of tax proposals out of the Democrats. ...
And they're going to do it over my dead veto - or live veto, or
something like that, because it ain't going to happen, I'll
guarantee you.''
   With his latest pledge of no-new-taxes and his bashing of
Democrats, Bush appeared to be testing themes for his own
re-election race in 1992 - although he insisted he hasn't decided
whether to run.
   ``I'm not thinking about '92,'' he said.
   Bush mugged an exaggerated grin when asked about the
weaker-than-expected election showings Tuesday of two potential
Democratic rivals - New York Gov. Mario Cuomo and New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley.
   He said he was heartened that GOP losses in gubernatorial and
congressional races were well below historical trends for a party
that controls the White House.
   ``I'm not talking about victory because I am very disappointed
that way some of the races turned out,'' Bush said.

<TEXT>
   In a strident address before
parliament Thursday, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan promised to end
his country's hat-in-hand relationship with the United States.
   Ishaq Khan also warned the 12-year-old war in neighboring
Afghanistan would not end until the Soviet Union halted its support
for that country's Communist government.
   The president made his remarks in a speech to a joint session of
Parliament.
   As expected, Pakistan's new Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif easily
won a vote of confidence in the 217-member National Assembly, the
policy-making lower house that two days earlier elected him prime
minister. He received 153 votes.
   It was unclear why the vote was called so soon because Sharif
has yet to form a government. Under Pakistani law, a vote of
confidence must be held within three months.
   ``We will no longer have our hands out for help. We can no
longer rely on others for our bread and butter. Otherwise, we will
never enter the 21st century with our heads held high,'' Ishaq Khan
said.
   Washington suspended $573 million in aid to Pakistan last month
after President Bush refused to guarantee that Islamabad did not
possess the capability for making nuclear weapons. There were
claims, however, the aid cut was an attempt to bolster Ms. Bhutto's
election campaign.
   It is believed that both Pakistan and its often hostile neighbor
to the east, India, have nuclear capability, although both deny the
charges.
   Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, whose 20-month-old
government was dismissed by Ishaq Khan Aug. 6 on charges of
corruption and mismanagement, did not attend the joint session.
   ``It wasn't a boycott. She just missed her plane,'' a spokesman
for Ms. Bhutto said on condition of anonymity.
   But none of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party members in
parliament attended the session.
   Ms. Bhutto has accused the president of staging a constitutional
coup against her government and engineering massive vote fraud in
last month's national elections.
   The right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance swept to power in
those elections. The coalition of 18 diverse parties capitalized on
the simmering anti-American sentiment in Pakistan.
   While Ms. Bhutto tried to portray herself as the symbol of
democracy that generated much needed foreign aid for Pakistan, her
opponents painted her as an American puppet.
   ``To those who wish to extend their hand of friendship as equal
partners we will take it. ... But we shall not compromise on our
basic rights,'' Ishaq Khan said.
   ``We hope that America will realize the importance of our
friendship rather than reacting to allegations.'' Before the
election, U.S. congressmen warned the president against
disqualifying Ms. Bhutto.
   The former prime minister faces seven charges of misconduct
before special one-judge tribunals. Conviction on any one of the
charges could bar her from politics for seven years.
   In his 30-minute Urdu-language speech, Ishaq Khan also warned
Moscow there would be no end to the civil war in neighboring
Afghanistan unless it abandons its support for the Kabul
government.
   ``It must be clear to the Soviet Union that what they allowed to
happen in Eastern Europe must also be applied to Afghanistan.
Otherwise, we will never have peace in the region,'' he said.
   U.S.-backed Afghan insurgents have fought successive Communist
governments in Kabul from their bases in Pakistan.
   When Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan in February 1989 after
nine years and the Moslem resistance failed in major battles,
attention shifted toward a political settlement, something the
fundamentalist guerrillas reject.

<HEAD>Alleged Bomber, on Hunger Strike, Appeals Extradition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspect in an IRA bombing who has been
on a hunger strike for 30 days appealed to the Supreme Court on
Thursday to block his extradition to Britain.
   The case is the first to come before the courts under the 1987
extradition act, which Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey has
said will facilitate the extradition of terrorist suspects.
   Dessie Ellis, 38, is wanted in Britain in connection with five
bomb attacks in the early 1980s. He says he cannot get a fair trial
there and should not be extradited.
   On Wednesday, he was hospitalized, and he was not in court for
the appeal.
   ``I will die rather than be extradited to Britain,'' Ellis said
in an interview published recently in Republican News, a weekly
newspaper that reflects the views of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army and its legal political wing, Sinn Fein.
   Britain's attorney general has issued warrants accusing Ellis of
conspiracy and possessing explosives.
   Ellis' attorney, Patrick McEntee, made three arguments against
extradition: that there are no corresponding offenses in Irish law,
that the six-year delay would make extradition ``unfair, improper
and constitutionally wrong,'' and that Ellis cannot receive a fair
trial in Britain.
   Chief Justice Thomas Finlay, one of five judges who heard the
appeal, reserved judgment. There was no indication when the court
would rule, but Irish Justice Minister Ray Burke had warned Ellis
on Tuesday that he might be dead by the time the court rules if he
persists in his hunger strike.
   Burke has refused appeals from Ellis' family that he intervene
to block extradition.
   His family said Ellis has lost 30 pounds and suffers from
fatigue, dizziness and sore eyes.
   The charges involve five incidents in 1981 in which three people
were killed and a military officer lost part of a leg. In previous
hearings, a detective from Scotland Yard said 13 fingerprints found
in a cache of explosives link Ellis to the crimes.
   Extradition has been a contentious issue between Britain and
Ireland, especially because of past cases in which suspects have
successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were
``political.''
   Owen Carron and James Pius Clarke, who successfully appealed
extradition earlier this year, attended Thursday's hearing. So did
Patrick Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest sought in Britain on
terrorist charges who convinced the Irish courts last year that he
could not get a fair trial.
   Opponents of extradition point to recent cases in Britain in
which appeals courts reversed convictions of alleged IRA members,
but only after some had been in prison 15 years.
   Ten prisoners belonging to the IRA or the Irish National
Liberation Army died on hunger strikes in the Maze Prison in
Northern Ireland in 1981. The best known was Bobby Sands, who was
elected to Parliament during his 65-day fast.
   No one has died on a hunger strike in Ireland since 1946.

   A judge's ruling has cleared the way for a
homosexual man to proceed with a discrimination lawsuit against the
Boy Scouts of America and its national policy banning homosexuals
as poor role models.
   Timothy Curran, 29, was asked to leave the Scouts in 1980 when
he took a young man to his senior prom. He filed his lawsuit in
1981 when his bid to return as an adult leader was rejected.
   Superior Court Judge Sally Disco ruled late Tuesday that the
Mount Diablo Council in the San Francisco Bay area is subject to
California's Unruh Civil Rights Act.
   The act forbids businesses from discriminating on the basis of
sexual orientation, race, religion or disability.
   Disco said the council is a business because it has considerable
property holdings and makes money by selling products to the
public.
   The Boy Scouts had argued that it is a non-profit organization
free to promote its own moral philosophy.
   Curran, a free-lance television editor and former Eagle Scout,
said he wants to serve as a scout leader and is not seeking
monetary damages.
   ``I'm really pleased to see that after 10 years in the courts
this case is developing some momentum and moving toward a
conclusion,'' Curran said Wednesday.
   The two sides will meet Nov. 16 to discuss a date for the start
of a jury trial.
   George Davidson, an attorney for the Boy Scouts, said he
believes the lawsuit will be decided in the organization's favor.

<HEAD>Woman Candidate Appears in Strong Position for Presidency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer who favors liberalizing strict
laws on birth control and abortion appeared in a strong position
Thursday to become Ireland's first woman president, according to
partial and unofficial returns.
   Mary Robinson trailed former deputy prime minister Brian Lenihan
in the preliminary count, but pre-election polls indicated the
second round on Friday would put her over the top.
   ``It looks like President Robinson now,'' said Justice Minister
Ray Burke, who had supported Lenihan, a member of the dominant
Fianna Fail party.
   ``It's looking good, but it's not by any manner or means decided
yet,'' said Mrs. Robinson, whose supporters staged early
celebrations. She was nominated by the Labor and Workers party,
although she has no party affiliation.
   As president, she would be expected to refrain from any
political controversies. The president's main powers are the right
to dissolve Parliament when a government has lost support, and to
refer legislation to the Supreme Court.
   On Thursday afternoon, unofficial returns showed Lenihan with
44.5 percent of the vote; Mrs. Robinson with 38.8 percent and
Austin Currie of Fine Gael with 16.7 percent, according to Press
Association, a British news agency.
   Turnout was estimated at 63 percent of the 2.47 million eligible
voters, compared with 68 percent in parliamentary elections last
year.
   Under the Irish system, voters mark a second preference on their
ballots. In the second round, Currie stands to be eliminated and
his votes distributed among the two top finishers.
   A poll published Tuesday in The Irish Times indicated that
urrie's supporters preferred Mrs. Robinson by 3-to-1 over Lenihan.
Currie had urged his supporters to make her their second choice.
   Former Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Fine Gael said on
Irish Radio that he expected Mrs. Robinson to finish with 52
percent of the vote.
   Mrs. Robinson, 46, would be the first leftist candidate to be
president of Ireland, and the first since 1945 who didn't come from
Fianna Fail.
   She is a lecturer in European Community law at Trinity College
in Dublin, and has supported more liberal contraception laws,
legalized divorce and the right of women to obtain information
about abortion, which is outlawed in Ireland but available in
Britain.
   Lenihan, 59, was first elected to Parliament in the 1960s, and
has held several Cabinet posts.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey was forced to dismiss Lenihan as
deputy prime mininster and defense minister last week to save his
coalition government from collapse.
   Lenihan was accused of lying about a his role in a 1982 attempts
to keep President Patrick Hillery from calling a national election.
   Lenihan quickly dropped from front-runner to second place in
opinion polls.
   Currie, 51, was a leader in the Catholic civil rights campaign
in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the main Catholic party there. He moved
to the Irish Republic and was elected last year to the Dail, the
lower house of Parliament.
   All three candidates are Catholics.
   It is Ireland's first contested presidential election in 17
years.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner
called for a truce Thursday in the escalating battle between the
nation's railroads and the trucking industry.
   The struggle, with each side threatening to take steps to hurt
the competitive position of the other, was prompted by the desire
of truckers to increase productivity by introducing heavier and
longer trucks to the nation's highways.
   That led to fears in the railroad industry that profits could be
slashed as cargo shifted from freight trains to the larger trucks.
   The fight is expected to move to Congress next year as the House
and Senate consider federal policies on surface transportation, a
debate that could lead to authorization of larger trucks.
   ``Competition between the railroad and trucking industries is
healthy and something that we expect and need,'' Skinner told the
annual meeting of the Railway Progress Institute.
   ``However, all of us recognize that a war of words can escalate
into the kind of conflict in which both sides are damaged,'' the
transportation secretary said.
   ``I am therefore beginning a very concerted effort to urge both
industries to remember that while they may argue about the
political and economic issues at one level, reality requires that
they cooperate at other levels,'' he said.
   ``Too much is at stake from a global competition standpoint for
the railroad and trucking industry to fight with each other,''
Skinner said.
   He said he will deliver an identical message to the trucking
industry.
   ``The message applies equally,'' he said. ``I favor no mode over
the other.''
   Skinner said his job was to ``assure that everyone gets heard,
that no one gets bowled over, that the end result is in the best
interest of the public and America's position in the global
economy,''

   President Bush said today he has ordered a new
wave of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf area to give the
multinational military force there an ``adequate offensive military
option should that be necessary.''
   The president's announcement at a White House news conference
did not specify how many more American forces would be added to
Operation Desert Shield, but Pentagon sources said it could be more
than 100,000.
   The sources said the extra troops would include armored
divisions from U.S. bases in Germany and possibly from the United
States.
   Bush said he did not need to get United Nations approval to
launch a military action against Iraq but indicated the
administration would first seek out that support.
   ``Yes, we have the authority but we've been great believers in
going to the United Nations,'' Bush said in a question and answer
session after his announcement.
   Bush said he still held out hope the confrontation over Iraq's
invasion and occupation of Kuwait could be settled short of war.
But he also said he wanted to give the American ground commander in
Saudi Arabia, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, a credible offensive
option.
   ``I would love to see a peaceful resolution to this question and
that's what I want,'' the president said as Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney stood nearby.
   But Bush added, ``I have not ruled out use of force at all, and
that's what's evident by what we've done here today.''
   Bush said 230,000 U.S. forces are in the gulf area now to ensure
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein does not gain a ``chokehold on
the world's economic lifeline.''
   High Pentagon officials have indicated for some time that
additional forces were being considered for the Operation Desert
Shield force now totaling 230,000 from the United States and 70,000
for allied countries.
   Iraq has deployed more than 400,000 troops in the region.
   In late October, Cheney said up to another 100,000 men and women
could be sent to the gulf area. He said at the time the Pentagon
had set no upper limit on deployments and that he wanted enough
force ``to deal with any contingency.''
   The source who disclosed the decision to send extra troops
declined to say how many would go. An armored division has nearly
20,000 troops but can require so many support units that it may
account for as many as 40,000 personnel.
   Meanwhile, a Marine official said Wednesday many hundreds more
combat troops from the Marine Corps Reserve are likely to be
ordered to active duty.
   The Marines on Tuesday said 824 reservists, including 633 combat
specialists, were being activated to become part of a 5th Marine
Expeditionary Brigade undergoing desert warfare training in
California.
   Those were the first combat reserve forces to be put on active
duty in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Col. Russell Appleton, head of manpower policy and planning at
Marine Corps headquarters, said reserves will be used to help form
expeditionary brigades to replace units scheduled to rotate out of
the gulf area.
   ``You're seeing the tip of that spear'' of reserve deployments,
he said, adding that he could not comment on any reserve call-ups
beyond those announced this week.
   Also on Wednesday, the Bush administration denounced the
procession of foreign dignitaries to Baghdad to plead for the
release of hostages.
   It is ``a matter of great concern to us,'' presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He referred specifically to recent
missions by former West German chancellor Willy Brandt, former
British prime minister Edward Heath and former Japanese prime
minster Yasuhiro Nakasone.
   ``Clearly, these people are being used. And we want to point
that out in the strongest terms,'' Fitzwater said.

<HEAD>State Experiencing Negative Impact From King Holiday Defeat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-King Boulevard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arizona voters' rejection of two ballot measures
that would have established a Martin Luther King Day already is
taking a toll on the state's pocketbook, economic development and
business leaders said.
   David Radcliffe, president of Phoenix &amp; Valley of the Sun
Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he knows of at least four
groups that have canceled reservations for conventions or stays at
hotels since the propositions failed in Tuesday's election.
   He could not identify the groups Thursday or say how many
visitors they would have brought to Arizona.
   ``I'm not anxious to call people to see if they want to
cancel,'' Radcliffe said. ``I've never been as high as the day we
booked the Super Bowl, and I've never been so low as I feel now.''
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Wednesday he will recommend
the 1993 Super Bowl be moved from the Phoenix area because of the
defeat of the King holiday. Gov. Rose Mofford estimated that losing
the Super Bowl would cost Arizona $200 million in lost revenue.
   Robert Hayward, a tourism analyst for the Pannell Kerr Forester
accounting firm, said losing the Super Bowl would not just mean
losing money, but also losing face.
   ``The Super Bowl leaving could be even worse for our image (than
the King Day rejection). It could put us squarely in the national
limelight,'' Hayward said.
   Since then-Gov. Evan Mecham in 1987 rescinded a holiday declared
by his predecessor, about 40 convention groups have canceled their
Arizona plans and the state has lost about $30 million, Radcliffe
said.
   Those figures are based only on what is documented, he said,
adding that other groups may have ruled out the state and state
officials would never even know of the loss.
   Robert Rudder, sales director for The Sheraton hotel in downtown
Phoenix, said two groups canceled reservations there since the
election, resulting in a $250,000 loss of revenue. He would not
identify the groups.
   The Sheraton will honor the holiday and is mounting a drive to
raise the $500,000 it is estimated it would cost the state to give
state employees a paid holiday, Rudder said. The hotel is offering
$50,000, he said.
   Rudder said the holiday was defeated Tuesday because the two
propositions on the ballot were ``conflicting and confusing.''
   One measure called for eliminating the state's existing Columbus
Day holiday and creating a King Day. The other called for having
both as paid holidays. The two propositions grew out of grassroots
petition drives following legislative action.
   The holiday issue may not be the deciding factor for businesses
and visitors to come to the state, but it may be used as an excuse,
said Chuck Shipley, vice president for government affairs for the
state Chamber of Commerce.
   The King Day issue also could tip the balance if it is a close
choice between Arizona and another state for a new industrial
plant, said Lois Yates, deputy director of the Arizona Department
of Commerce.
   Bob Mariano, president and chief executive of Chase Bank of
Arizona, said executives from the parent Chase Manhattan Corp. of
New York expressed concern over the holiday defeat. The executives
would not say if the vote would affect their decision on where to
relocate a proposed credit-card operation, Mariano said.
   Suburban Tempe is one of two finalists for the 2,000-employee
operation. The other is Salt Lake City.

<HEAD>Germany, Poland Agree to Sign Border Treaty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT AN DER ODER, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl
announced Thursday that Poland and the newly united Germany will
sign a historic border treaty this month, ending decades of concern
over the common frontier.
   Kohl also said he wanted a wide-ranging friendship and
cooperation treaty to be submitted to the German and Polish
legislatures for ratification by the end of February.
   ``We are deeply convinced that real peace will be possible only
if Germans and Poles march together along this road into a peaceful
future,'' Kohl said of the treaties.
   He made the comments following a day of talks with Polish Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first foreign leader to visit
united Germany.
   Mazowiecki said he was satisfied with the ``important results''
of the talks in this German border town on the Oder River across
from Poland.
   Mazowiecki also said the German-Polish border must not be a
divider between East and West. ``We want this border to bring us
closer and not to divide Europe between the developed rich and the
poor,'' he said.
   The meeting came exactly one year after Kohl became the first
Western leader to visit newly democratic Poland, a trip interrupted
when the dramatic news reached Warsaw that the Berlin Wall had
fallen.
   Kohl pleased his Polish guests on Thursday by saying he hoped
visa requirements for Poles to visit Germany would be lifted by
Christmas.
   ``I think we made great progress for the future,'' Polish
government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska told reporters,
adding the visit was ``a big success.''
   People from former East Germany do not need visas to visit
Poland, and many travel there to shop in the flourishing,
inexpensive Polish markets.
   While Polish traders welcome the business, other Poles have
expressed resentment over their need for visas.
   After their talks, Kohl and Mazowiecki crossed the wide bridge
over the Oder into the Polish town of Slubice, where they were
greeted by about 1,000 cheering residents.
   The border treaty would confirm the present border formed by the
Oder and Neisse rivers and commit Germany to relinquishing claims
on former German territory forever.
   The Oder-Neisse border, drawn by the victorious wartime Allies
in 1945, gave Poland 45,000 square miles of formerly German land.
   An even larger part of Poland was taken by the Soviet Union
after the war.
   The post-war explusion of millions of German refugees is still
an emotional issue in Germany.
   During the news conference, a man identifying himself as Hermann
Schulz held up a German flag together with that of his homeland in
East Prussia, now part of Poland.
   ``We should be allowed to be represented at these talks. We want
to return to our homeland,'' he said.
   Many Germans have questioned the border through the years,
dreaming of a possible return to the Silesian, Pomeranian and East
Prussian land that make up about one-third of present-day Poland.
   Travel between the two countries should become easier soon.
   Kohl said the two-lane, 372-mile stretch of highway that links
Warsaw and the German capital Berlin should be improved.
   The friendship and cooperation treaty, like a treaty to be
signed between Germany and the Soviet Union on Friday, will lay the
foundation for future economic, political and cultural cooperation.
   Kohl stressed Germany's commitment to helping Poland make the
transformation from a socialist to a capitalist economy, adding
that he would help Poland obtain associate member status in the
European Community.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher is to travel to Warsaw
later this month to sign the border treaty with his Polish
counterpart Krzystof Skubiszewski. A precise date was not given.

   Racism prompted city voters to reverse a
4-year-old decision that named a street in honor of slain civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., critics said.
   Harrisburg voters approved a referendum Tuesday to change to
name of Rev. Dr. M.L. King Boulevard back to Market Street.
   The Rev. Jefferson Wright, who opposed the referendum, said
racism drove voters.
   ``The street was there for four years until a bunch of racists
came along to take it down as a reassurance in their minds of their
power,'' he said.
   The City Council voted in 1986 to name 24 blocks of the major
thoroughfare after King.
   Residents opposed to the change won a non-binding referendum in
the spring of 1987 to return the street's name to Market Street,
but the City Council ignored it.
   Enraged, the residents hit the streets to gather enough
signatures to put a binding referendum on Tuesday's ballot.
   James H. High, a supporter of the referendum, denied the charges
of racism. He said people were angry that the council had ignored
the wishes of a majority of voters.
   ``I think this raised such a fervor because it's always been
Market Street and we've always had a Market Street. Most cities
have a Market Street,'' he said.
   Some residents of King Boulevard also complained about the
inconvenience of changing their addresses.
   A spokesman for Mayor Stephen Reed said the new street signs
should be in place within the next 30 days.
   ``The idea of them taking the signs down hurts so bad,'' said
referendum opponent Dana Olsen. ``I have an image of them taking
the signs down and throwing them in the back of some open-panel
truck and dumping them somewhere. That hurts.''

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 high school students continued
protests Thursday seeking more spending on education, and hundreds
blocked railway tracks to demand free train rides to a mass rally
in Paris.
   At several stations where youths occupied the tracks, officials
of the national railroad offered 60 percent discounts to those
wishing to attend Monday's rally. It was not immediately clear if
the students accepted the offer.
   Thursday's protests were largely without violence, as has been
the case throughout most of the three-week campaign. Youths in Lyon
broke windows and threw stones, injuring one student, but protest
organizers described the troublemakers as ``outside elements.''
   In Paris, where a few thousand students marched, some youths
smashed windows and looted a shoe store. Police reported seven
arrests.
   Marches and rallies have taken place daily across France this
week, and an even bigger show of force is expected Monday when, for
the first time, students have been urged to converge on Paris from
throughout the country.
   On Thursday, major associations of parents and teachers endorsed
the students' goals.
   The biggest turnout was in Toulouse, where an estimated 15,000
students marched. Several hundred blocked tracks at the train
station, demanding a free trip to Paris on Monday, and railroad
officials offered a round-trip fare of $40 - a 60 percent discount.
   Tracks at several other stations also were blocked by youths
demanding free rides to Paris on Monday.
   About 3,000 students protested in Lyon, 5,000 in Besancon, 4,000
in Reims, 6,000 in Rennes, 10,000 in Brest, 6,000 in Quimper and
2,000 in Toulon, according to police and student and media
estimates.
   The protests began in the northern suburbs of Paris following
the gang rape of a girl in a school lavatory and assaults on
several teachers. The students have been demanding more government
spending to improve security on campus, replace substandard
facilities, upgrade curriculum and hire more teachers to ease
classroom overcrowding.

   A national grassroots drive to oust incumbent
politicians may have failed this election year, but its founder
said Thursday he is already looking ahead to the 1992 elections.
   ``We're going to take a look at what we did wrong and how we can
make it better. Then it's back to business,'' Jack Gargan said.
``Now we have the funding, credibility - and two years.''
   Gargan said his group, ``Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out'' or
THRO, intends to buy a full-page advertisement in USA Today to
thank supporters nationwide, then begin looking toward 1992 and
races for president and Congress.
   ``We're going to say `thank you, America' and let folks know
we're going for bear in '92,'' he said.
   Gargan said a national taxpayer association representative told
him Thursday that Tuesday's races involving incumbents were roughly
12 percent closer than had been predicted.
   ``When you can go from a dead stop in 132 days and make a 12
percent impact with no staff, no funding and no experience, it's
heartwarming,'' he said.
   Gargan, 59, who is a financial planner, formed the non-profit
THRO in June and targeted members of Congress as irresponsible
spenders to be voted out. He used $9,000 in retirement money to buy
a full-page local newspaper advertisement headlined: ``I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!''
   Since then, he said he's received about $600,000 in
contributions and letters from more than 70,000 people. As the
money came in, he bought ads in newspapers small and large, urging
people to vote against all incumbents in all races.
   While he doesn't have final figures yet, Gargan said the
campaign war chest should have $100,000 to $200,000 left.
   ``We became sort of a threat and we forced them (incumbents) to
spend much more of that PAC (political action committee) money to
boost themselves,'' he said. ``We also made people across this
nation step back and look at who's running this country.''
   Gary Koops, spokesman for the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee in Washington, said THRO reflected the discontent of
voters nationwide who were weary of ``business as usual'' in
Congress.
   ``Many incumbents who'll be going back to Washington were scared
for their political lives,'' Koops said.
   Others - such as Hollis Friedman, a spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington - said
the anti-incumbent sentiment was overblown.
   ``The few incumbents that did lose lost because they weren't
addressing the people's needs and interests properly and not
because people just wanted to get rid of an incumbent,'' Friedman
said.
   Robin Krivanek, Hillsborough County supervisor of elections,
said the anti-incumbent mood came through loud and clear locally.
   ``What amazed us is that there were people out there taking a
blanket approach to this campaign,'' Krivanek said. ``We had people
who had no idea of who these people were but wanted their names so
they could vote them out.''

<HEAD>FCC Takes Tentative Step Against Toy-Based TV Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission moved
Thursday toward a possible crackdown on children's TV programs
based on toys, but an official said the agency was ``twisting and
turning'' to steer clear of shows such as ``Sesame Street.''
   Critics contend that programs such as ``He-Man'' and ``G.I.
Joe'' are thinly disguised sales pitches and have urged the FCC to
declare such shows to be 30-minute commercials.
   The commission, however, wasn't willing to go that far.
   ``The mere fact that a story line ... is built around a toy
being sold on the market would not make it a program-length
commercial,'' said Regina Harrison, a lawyer in the FCC's mass
media bureau.
   The commission, she said, was ``twisting and turning trying to
reach a definition that won't cut out shows'' such as ``Sesame
Street.''
   The commission, under orders from Congress to complete a
3-year-old investigation into so-called program-length commercials,
proposed defining such programs as any children's show ``associated
with a product in which commercials for that product are aired.''
   Previously, the commission defined program-length commercials as
material ``so interwoven with, and in essence auxiliary to, the
sponsor's advertising'' that the entire program is in effect a
commercial.
   Peggy Charren, president of the Action for Children's
Television, said manufacturers don't advertise their toys on shows
based on their products for fear children won't notice the ads.
   She said the FCC's proposed definition would not solve the
problem of shows being used to promote toys.
   The commission invited public comment on what penalties, if any,
should be imposed on program-length commercials. Harrison said
violators could receive fines or have their licenses threatened at
renewal, or both.
   The commission also said it would consider during license
renewal whether a station had provided programs specifically
designed to meet the educational and informational needs of
children.
   The commission, in the same 5-0 vote Thursday, proposed
implementing ad time limits that Congress ordered as part of the
Children's Television Act of 1990.
   Those limits are 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends and 12
minutes per hour on weekdays on children's shows, including cable
TV.
   The rules are to take effect in April, and violations could lead
to fines from $25,000 to $250,000.
   The commission lifted similar restrictions in 1984, but
congressional testimony showed that advertising on some programs
increased to 14 minutes per hour. A federal appeals court in 1987
ordered the FCC to reconsider its decision.

<TEXT>
   A suspect in IRA bombings who has been on
a hunger strike for 30 days appealed Thursday to the Supreme Court
to block his extradition to Britain.
   The case is the first to come before the courts under the 1987
extradition act, which Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey has
said will facilitate the extradition of terrorist suspects.
   Dessie Ellis, 38, is wanted in Britain in connection with five
bomb attacks in the early 1980s. He says he cannot get a fair trial
there and should not be extradited.
   On Wednesday, he was hospitalized, and he was not in court for
the appeal.
   ``I will die rather than be extradited to Britain,'' Ellis said
in an interview published recently in Republican News, a weekly
newspaper that reflects the views of the outlawed Irish Republican
Army and its legal political wing, Sinn Fein.
   Britain's attorney general has issued warrants accusing Ellis of
conspiracy and possessing explosives.
   Ellis' attorney, Patrick McEntee, made three arguments against
extradition: that there are no corresponding offenses in Irish law,
that the six-year delay would make extradition ``unfair, improper
and constitutionally wrong,'' and that Ellis cannot receive a fair
trial in Britain.
   Chief Justice Thomas Finlay, one of five judges who heard the
appeal, reserved judgment. There was no indication when the court
would rule, but Irish Justice Minister Ray Burke had warned Ellis
on Tuesday that he might be dead by the time the court rules if he
persists in his hunger strike.
   Burke has refused appeals from Ellis' family that he intervene
to block extradition.
   His family said Ellis has lost 30 pounds and suffers from
fatigue, dizziness and sore eyes.
   The charges involve five incidents in 1981 in which three people
were killed and a military officer lost part of a leg. In previous
hearings, a detective from Scotland Yard said 13 fingerprints found
in a cache of explosives link Ellis to the crimes.
   Extradition has been a contentious issue between Britain and
Ireland, especially because of past cases in which suspects have
successfully pleaded that their alleged offenses were
``political.''
   Owen Carron and James Pius Clarke, who successfully appealed
extradition earlier this year, attended Thursday's hearing. So did
Patrick Ryan, a Roman Catholic priest sought in Britain on
terrorist charges who convinced the Irish courts last year that he
could not get a fair trial.
   Opponents of extradition point to recent cases in Britain in
which appeals courts reversed convictions of alleged IRA members,
but only after some had been in prison 15 years.
   Ten prisoners belonging to the IRA or the Irish National
Liberation Army died on hunger strikes in the Maze Prison in
Northern Ireland in 1981. The best known was Bobby Sands, who was
elected to Parliament during his 65-day fast.
   No one has died on a hunger strike in Ireland since 1946.

   Here is a transcript of remarks by President
Bush and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announcing the dispatch of
additional U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I have a brief statement and then I'd be glad to
take a couple of questions and then turn to Secretary Cheney who
will take some questions. And then he will go over to the Pentagon
for an in-depth - more of an in-depth briefing.
   On August 6th, in response to the unprovoked Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, I ordered the deployment of U.S. military forces to Saudi
Arabia and the Persian Gulf to deter further Iraqi aggression and
to protect our interests in the region. What we've done is right,
and I'm happy to say that most members of Congress and the majority
of Americans agree.
   Before the invasion in August, we had succeeded in the struggle
for freedom in Eastern Europe, and we'd hopefully begun a new era
that offered the promise of peace.
   Following the invasion, I stated that if history had taught it
any lesson it was that we must resist aggression or it would
destroy our freedom. Just ask the people of Kuwait and the foreign
nationals in hiding there and the staffs of the remaining embassies
who have experienced the horrors of Iraq's illegal occupation, its
systematic dismantling of Kuwait and its abuse of Kuwaitis and
other citizens.
   The world community also must prevent an individual clearly bent
on regional domination from establishing a choke hold on the
world's economic lifeline. We are seeing global economic stability
and growth already at risk as each day countries around the world
pay dearly for Saddam Hussein's aggression.
   From the very beginning, we and our coalition partners have
shared common political goals: the immediate, complete and
unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait; restoration
of Kuwait's legitimate government; protection of the lives of
citizens held hostage by Iraq, both in Kuwait and Iraq; and
restoration of security and stability in the Persian Gulf region.
   To achieve these goals, we and our allies have forged a strong
diplomatic, economic and military strategy to force Iraq to comply
with these objectives. The framework of this strategy is laid out
in 10 United Nations resolutions overwhelmingly supported by the
United Nations Security Council.
   In three months, the U.S. troop contribution to the
multinational force in Saudi Arabia has gone from 10,000 to 230,000
as part of Operation Desert Shield. Gen. Schwarzkopf reports that
our forces in conjunction with other coalition forces now have the
capability to defend successfully against any further Iraqi
aggression.
   After consultation with King Fahd and our other allies, I have
today directed the Secretary of Defense to increase the size of
U.S. forces committed to Desert Shield to ensure that the coalition
has an adequate offensive military option should that be necessary
to achieve our common goals. Toward this end, we will continue to
discuss the possibility of both additional allied force
contributions and appropriate United Nation actions.
   Iraq's brutality, aggression and violations of international law
cannot be allowed to succeed.

   When CNN continued its coverage of recorded
telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal
judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story.
   Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of
several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its
first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to
unconstitutional prior restraint.
   Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from
broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with
his lawyers that could infringe on attorney-client privilege.
   CNN used excerpts from the jailhouse tapes Thursday morning,
repeated that during the day and said it planned to televise
another installment Thursday evening.
   The Atlanta-based cable news operation said it would appeal
Hoeveler's ruling.
   Ms. Crier, the youngest woman elected to Texas District Court,
was among the anchors explaining that CNN continued to repeat the
morning segment ``because it believes it has the right to do so
under the First Amendment.''
   CNN said Ms. Crier had nothing to do with the decision to
broadcast the story, and was reading the same commentary as other
anchors.
   CNN declined to allow her to be interviewed about the story's
judicial ramifications.
   Ms. Crier created a stir when she was hired at the 24-hour news
network in 1989 with no journalistic experience. She has said she
left the judgeship because courtroom competition ``may have
surpassed the notion of serving clients, of seeking justice.''

<HEAD>Food Coupons to be Issued in Moscow on Dec. 1</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coupons will be distributed to Muscovites
beginning Dec. 1 to ensure that staples such as meat, butter and
flour are not stripped from the capital's shelves by non-resident
shoppers, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The coupons, to be sold for about $56 for a month's supply, will
enable residents to purchase 3.3 pounds of meat, nearly a
half-pound of butter and 1.1 pounds of flour, according to the
Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper.
   The newspaper article indicated the coupons might buy other
items but it did not list them. It also did not provide any more
details on the program, except to say the measure was announced by
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov.
   The move appeared to represent the latest attempt by city
officials to keep out-of-towners from raiding the usually
better-stocked store shelves in Moscow.
   In recent weeks, there have been fears that Moscow will be
facing a hungry winter because of the nation's worsening economy,
problems with supplies of food and a poor harvest of traditionally
plentiful staples such as potatoes.
   Residents would not necessarily be limited to these stated
amounts of meat, flour and butter, but could buy them at
higher-priced private markets.
   Coupons already are issued for sugar and cigarettes, limiting
citizens to 4.4 pounds of sugar and seven packs of cigarettes per
month per person. Other cities in the country have different
limitations on these goods and others, including vodka.
   The coupons do not ensure that the products can be found,
however. Even with coupons, some residents have a hard time finding
sugar for sale at state stores.
   In May, state stores began requiring that shoppers in Moscow
show their internal passports to prove they live in the region. The
move stemmed from a wave of panic-buying that followed the
announcement of plans to increase prices of certain goods - plans
that later were canceled.
   The residence requirement angered shoppers who had to remember
to carry their passports with them and slowed down long queues
while sales clerks looked for the stamp that indicated Moscow
residency. Many clerks simply stopped checking for the residency
stamp, defeating the purpose of the regulations.
   The Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper sarcastically headlined the
brief article on the introduction of the food coupons, ``Let's have
a feast.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union Gives Qualified Support For Use Of Force In Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reluctantly and for the first time, the Soviet
Union gave its qualified consent Thursday to the use of military
force to get Iraqi invaders out of Kuwait if peaceful pressure
tactics fail.
   But even as U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III
accomplished this goal, it became apparent that an arms control
treaty due for signing in Paris in less than two weeks was still
not finished.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said there were
problems concluding the accord to reduce NATO and Warsaw Pact
tanks, antiaircraft artillery and other non-nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   U.S. officials, who demanded anonymity, said the problems were
more than technical in nature and that Baker would leave behind
arms control experts to keep working on them when he flies to
London and Paris on Friday to continue his consultations on the
Persian Gulf situation.
   Baker came to Moscow on Wednesday seeking at least Soviet
acquiescence to the Bush administration's intention of having the
U.N. Security Council authorize the use of force as a last resort
to liberate Kuwait.
   His visit came as President Bush announced in Washington that he
has ordered a new wave of U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf area to
give the multinational military force there an ``adequate offensive
military option should that be necessary.''
   Baker has talked about the military option during his travels to
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and the Soviet Union.
   On Tuesday in Cairo Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told
Baker that China, along with the Soviet Union, the United States,
France and Britain a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
would not block a U.N. resolution on the use of force.
   Shevardnadze made no mention of military action in a joint news
conference with Baker until he was pressed by reporters.
   Finally, he said: ``whether or not the use of force could be
ruled out -- probably this could not be ruled out -- and a
situation may emerge which effectively would require such a move.''
   Baker, who stood tensely at Shevardnadze's side, smiled at the
assertion. It was the first time the Soviets had indicated publicly
they would at least acquiesce if the United States, which holds the
presidency of the Security Council this month, attempted to win
passage of a resolution authorizing force against Iraq.
   Shevardnadze stressed that any decision to use force against the
Iraqis should be taken by the United Nations. ``We should not doubt
the ability of the Security Council to take wise and mature
decisions,'' he said.
   ``I would advise against looking for some difference in the
positions between the Soviet Union and the United States,''
Shevardnadze said.
   Shevardnadze was more evasive in a later session with Soviet
reporters.
   Asked if Moscow would support the use of force under the U.N.
Charter, the Soviet foreign minister responded with a laugh: ``I
won't say.''
   Baker said the two governments had agreed on the principle that
a peaceful settlement is preferable but the use of force could not
be ruled out.
   Earlier, Shevardnadze had said the use of force would be
``undesirable'' and that ``the No. 1 task of the international
community is to see that the U.N. resolutions are implemented.''
   Baker met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for nearly
two hours at his official country residence outside the city and
held sessions with Shevardnadze before and after that meeting. The
talks covered 13 hours, after which Baker called Bush with a
report.
   Meanwhile, differences still stood in the way of the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, the projected centerpiece for
a 34-nation summit meeting in Paris Nov. 19-21.
   ``My guess is that we would be able to find a solution to all
the problems,'' Shevardnadze said during a break in his talks with
Baker.
   They then returned to the subject and Margaret Tutwiler, the
State Department spokeswoman, said they ``settled a number of
technical issues.''
   Bush has said he would not attend the summit unless the treaty
was ready. It is the most comprehensive arms control accord in
history, encompassing Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Hanging in the balance also is another accord to cut U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30
percent. Shevardnadze said there were ``some difficult problems''
with that pact, which Bush had hoped to sign at another summit
meeting this winter in Moscow.
   The outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues,
including how much leeway the Soviets would have to keep testing
their SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles.

<TEXT>
   One woman lost an eye and at least 12 other
people are being treated for serious eye infections after using
bacteria-contaminated drops made by a pharmacy here, doctors said
Thursday.
   Surgeons at Allegheny General Hospital this week discovered the
drops were tainted after the woman who lost her eye was referred to
them, said Dr. John Kennerdell, chairman of the hospital's
ophthalmology department.
   ``Once this type of bacteria gains access to the inside of the
eye it causes a very devastating infection,'' Kennerdell said.
``That's why it's so dangerous.''
   The majority of the 13 patients, mostly women 55 to 78 years
old, took the drops after undergoing cataract surgery during the
past month, Kennerdell said.
   It isn't known how many people bought or used the contaminated
drops. However, pharmacist Joseph Kilkeary, who made the eye drops,
said 20 to 25 customers bought the drops in October. They have been
told to quit using the drug and return it to their doctor or the
pharmacy.
   Thirteen people were hospitalized for treatment, nine at
Allegheny General, three at Central Medical Center and one at Eye &amp;
Ear Institute, all in Pittsburgh, doctors said. One man who used
the drops is being monitored by Kennerdell but shows no sign of
infection.
   Doctors removed the woman's right eye last week after
antibiotics failed. The 12 other patients are receiving large doses
of antibiotics. Two of the patients have impaired vision and could
lose an eye, Kennerdell said.
   Doctors declined to disclose the patients' names.
   The drops were sold by Hieber's Drug Store, which has been in
business for more than a century and is owned by Kilkeary. The
pharmacist said he makes about 10 bottles at a time for five
Pittsburgh physicians who prescribe the medication.
   The drops contain a liquid solution and Indocin, a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug taken in pill-form for arthritis. Although
the Food and Drug Administration has approved use of Indocin for
arthritis, some doctors prescribe it to reduce swelling of the
retina following eye surgery, Kennerdell said.
   Kilkeary dissolves the pills in a liquid solution, sterilizes
the mixture and bottles it.
   Pharmacists commonly mix solutions not offered by drug companies
when doctors prescribe them, said Harvey Miller, an FDA spokesman
in Philadelphia. He said the practice is legal as long as doctors
prescribe the drugs.
   The FDA will investigate to determine whether any federal laws
were violated, he said.
   Gary Bruell - a spokesman for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, the maker of
Indocin - said the drug is intended to be taken orally for
arthritic conditions.
   ``We really can't comment on what physicians or pharmacists may
be doing with the product outside its current labeling,'' he said.
   The doctors who prescribed the drops also have been notified,
Kennerdell said.
   Kilkeary said he didn't know how many bottles were contaminated.
Lab tests on bottles in the store found no contamination, he said.
   ``I have no idea how many bottles were not sterile,'' he said.
   Kilkeary, a pharmacist for more than 40 years, said he has sold
the drops for years without any problems and can't imagine what
might have gone wrong.
   Kennerdell said he suspects the pharmacy's sterilizer, used to
purify the drops after the solution is mixed, was faulty. Kilkeary
said he had no reason to suspect the equipment, which is new.

   Katharine Hepburn, who turned 81 Thursday, was
philosophical about her advancing age, saying ``I look forward to
oblivion.''
   ``I'm what is known as gradually disintegrating,'' Hepburn said
in an interview in her home last month. ``I don't fear the next
world, or anything. I don't fear hell, and I don't look forward to
heaven.''
   But Hepburn was far from all gloom and doom in the interview
with The Associated Press. She said she still enjoys life to the
fullest and is still being offered acting roles.
   ``Yes, I get offered roles,'' she said. ``But I'm fascinated by
writing now. I find all life thrilling. So that I like to write, I
like to paint, I like to play tennis, I like to swim.''
   ``I don't like depressing stories about the inevitability of
someone going down the drain. Getting old? I think it's unhealthy.
Why should anyone want to see that. They're all going to get old,
they're all going to fade away.''
   Hepburn credits her survival in Hollywood - and life - to her
innate sturdiness.
   ``I'm tough by nature. Tough, direct,'' she said. ``My father
was that way. My mother was that way. We were encouraged to be that
way. If you do something that is unpopular, but you believe in it,
I think that's what matters. And if someone tries to dissuade you
from that, I would be very tough about it.''

<HEAD>Analysts See Further Sign of Consumer Spending Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans took out a seasonally adjusted $3
billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in September,
the government said Thursday in a report some analysts saw as a
further sign of a consumer spending slowdown.
   Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington
management consulting company, said consumer credit this year will
increase only 3.5 percent, compared with growth of about 9 percent
in both 1988 and 1989.
   It's another sign of slower spending by consumers who account
for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, she said.
   The Federal Reserve said consumer credit in September rose 4.9
percent at an annual rate after an increase of 5 percent, or $3.1
billion, in August.
   While the August borrowing pace was stronger than the 3.4
percent rate first reported last month, it was slower than the 7.8
percent increase posted in July.
   Ms. Shaber also said the amount of debt compared to disposable
personal income has been dropping - a sign, she said, of a lack of
consumer confidence.
   ``And it's not likely to get any better,'' she said.
   Various surveys have shown that consumer confidence has been
fading recently, particularly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
August.
   Declines in confidence often mean a drop in spending - and thus
a slower economy - even if consumers have the money.
   Nevertheless, automobile loans rose in September for the first
month since March. They posted a 0.7 percent increase at an annual
rate to a seasonally adjusted $163 million after a 6.3 percent, or
$1.5 billion decline in August.
   But Ms. Shaber said that while consumer auto purchases picked up
slightly in September, ``we'll see much smaller increases if not
some liquidation'' in auto loans in the current quarter.
   Revolving, or credit card, debt rose 10.7 percent, or $1.9
billion, down from a 13.3 percent growth rate in August. Ms. Shaber
said much revolving credit is for convenience buying and is repaid
in 30 days.
   ``It's not really debt,'' she said.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 6.6
percent, or $1.2 billion, after jumping 11.7 percent a month
earlier.
   Borrowing for mobile homes fell 11.4 percent, or $219 million,
after a 9.5 percent, or $180 million, increase in August.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at the end of
September at $735.4 billion.

<TEXT>
   Guatemalan voters squeezed by five years
of rising inflation and crime are approaching this week's
presidential elections with chilly indifference.
   Guatemala's 3 million registered voters were urged to stay away
from the polls in newspaper ads run Thursday by the Guatemalan
National Revolutionary Unit, an umbrella group representing the
country's guerrilla organizations.
   Although the ads did not threaten violence in Sunday's election,
the group resorted to blowing up bridges and downing trees across
highways to keep the electorate away during the country's last
election in 1985.
   President Vinicio Cerezo of the Christian Democrat Party,
prevented by law from seeking a second term, became the country's
first civilian president following a series of military or
military-backed regimes. During his term, unemployment, inflation
and crime have risen dramatically.
   As many as 29 percent of voters questioned by one pollster said
they planned to cast a blank ballot on Sunday, a traditional form
of protest in this Central American country. Twelve candidates are
vying for president.
   The poll, released Wednesday by Guatemala's private sector,
identified the frontrunner as newspaper publisher Jorge Rafael
Carpio Nicolle of the National Center Union party, with 21 percent
of the vote.
   Carpio Nicolle, who was narrowly defeated by Cerezo in a runoff
election in 1985, has been the frontrunner in polls since he
announced his candidacy last year.
   He was followed, with 17 percent of the vote, by Alvaro Enrique
Arzu Irigoyen, the former mayor of Guatemala City who resigned this
year to run on the Advanced National Party ticket. Margin of error
for the poll was not available.
   If no candidate gets a majority of the vote on Sunday, the two
frontrunners will compete in a runoff vote on Jan. 6, with the
winner taking office on Jan. 14. A runoff is considered a virtual
certainty.
   Voters also will choose 116 members of congress and 300 mayors.
   Cerezo's predecessor, retired Gen. Jose Efrain Rios Montt, was
waging a vigorous campaign for Sunday's election until he was ruled
constitutionally ineligible to hold office because he came to power
during a 1982 military coup.
   Rios Montt, whose regime of law and order and swift justice is
remembered fondly by many Guatemalans but criticized by rights
activists, urged voters this week to cast blank presidential
ballots but to vote in the other races.
   A Rios Montt backer has filed a motion to block the elections
because he was barred from running, but legal specialists say it is
unlikely to be granted.
   About 300 foreign observers will attend the elections, including
Joao Baena Soares, heads of the Organization of American States.
   Preliminary results from the nation's 5,630 polling places are
expected Sunday night.

   Secretary Baker has been consulting with our key partners in the
coalition. He's met with the Emirs of Bahrain and Kuwait, King
Fahd, President Mubarak, as well as the Chinese foreign minister,
President Ozal, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, President Gorbachev.
He also will be meeting with Prime Minister Thatcher and President
Mitterrand.
   I have been heartened by Jim's appraisal of the strong
international solidarity and determination to ensure that Iraq's
aggression does not stand and is not rewarded.
   But right now Kuwait is struggling for survival. And along with
many other nations, we've been called upon to help. The
consequences of our not doing so would be incalculable, because
Iraq's aggression is not just a challenge to the security of Kuwait
and other Gulf nations, but to the better world that we all have
hoped to build in the wake of the Cold War.
   And therefore, we and our allies cannot and will not shirk our
responsibilities. The state of Kuwait must be restored, or no
nation will be safe, and the promising future we anticipate will
indeed be jeopardized.
   Let me conclude with a word to the young American GIs deployed
in the Gulf. We are proud of each and every one of you. I know you
miss your loved ones and want to know when you'll be coming home.
We won't leave you there any longer than necessary. I want every
single soldier out of there as soon as possible. And we are all
grateful for your continued sacrifice and your commitment.
   Now, with no further ado, I'd be glad to take a couple of
questions and then refer to, when I leave - Dick, take some
questions, and then go over to the Pentagon.
   Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, it sounds like you're going to war. You have
moved from a defensive position to an offensive position and you
have not said how many more troops you are sending or really why.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I said why right now, and I hope that it's
been very clear to the American people.
   Q: Well is there - are there new reasons that have moved this
posture?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, I'm just continuing to do what we feel is
necessary to complete our objectives, to fulfill our objectives
that have been clearly stated.
   Q: Well, are you going to war?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I'm not - we - I would love to see a peaceful
resolution to this question. And that's what I want.
   Q: What made you change from defense to offense?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I would like to see a peaceful solution to this
question. I think Saddam Hussein should fully, without condition,
comply to the U.N. resolutions. And if this movement of force is
what convinces him, so much the better.
   Yeah -
   Q: Mr. President, you said that - you said last week that the
sanctions haven't had the impact that you wanted. Some - some
members of the coalition are urging a go-slow approach. The
President of Egypt says you've got to wait two or three months
before you judge whether the sanctions have worked. Are you willing
to wait that long?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Wait for what?
   Q: To see if the sanctions have worked?

   President Bush said Thursday he was
immediately sending ``significant numbers'' of additional military
forces to the Persian Gulf to build ``an adequate offensive
option'' if needed to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Asked directly whether he was going to war, Bush said, ``I would
like to see a peaceful solution to this question. I think Saddam
Hussein should fully'' withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   ``If this movement of force is what convinces him, so much the
better,'' Bush said. He added later, ``When he surveys the force
that's there ... he will recognize that he is up against just a foe
that he can't possible manage militarily.''
   The president would not say how big the buildup would be. There
are 230,000 Americans in the Gulf region, and Secretary of Defense
Dick Cheney told reporters, ``We will not put an upper limit on
this deployment.''
   Congressional and administration sources had said overnight that
two armored divisions from Europe would be moved to the gulf. An
armored division has nearly 20,000 troops but can require so many
support units that it may account for as many as 40,000 personnel.
   Cheney said additional Army, Navy and Marine forces would be
involved, along with hundreds of battle tanks.
   Army National Guard combat units will be activated for the first
time, though a decision won't be made until later on whether they
will be shipped overseas or merely filled in behind regular Army
troops sent earlier, the defense secretary said.
   Bush spoke as Secretary of State James A. Baker III was in
Moscow consulting senior Soviet officials over Persian Gulf
strategy.
   Soviet officials said they could not rule out the use of force.
Bush called this statement ``very helpful,'' and said, ``We're on
the same wavelength'' with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on goals
in the Middle East.
   Bush said he hopes international economic sanctions force Saddam
to withdraw, but his declaration concerning offensive forces
dramatically altered his three-month policy in the Persian Gulf,
which has been to be able to withstand further aggression by Iraq.
   It was Bush's second news conference of the day. Earlier, he
discussed political and economic matters, but brushed off questions
about the gulf. It was possible that this gave Baker time for fresh
meetings in Moscow.
   The president said he also had consulted with Saudi King Fahd,
whose nation has provided the main staging area for the U.S. and
multinational deployment.
   The deployment began at 10,000 troops shortly after the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and has grown to 230,000.
   The new buildup involves ``a considerable additional increment
to U.S. forces,'' said Cheney. He said naval, air and heavy ground
forces from the United States and Europe would be deployed.
   Bush said current forces were adequate as a defense against
``any further provocation'' by Iraq.
   To the troops half a world away, he pledged: ``We won't leave
you there any longer than necessary.''
   Cheney stood by the president's side as he announced:
   ``I have directed (him) to increase the size of U.S. forces
committed to Desert Shield to ensure that the coalition has
adequate offensive military option should that be necessary.''
   Bush committed American troops three months ago, and since then
has spearheaded the development of an international diplomatic
response that has included massive forces and several United
Nations resolutions calling on Iraq to withdraw its troops from
Kuwait.
   Asked what had changed that led him to decide to beef up the
forces, he replied that it was a ``guarantee of the safety of all
and I think it sends a very strong signal'' to Saddam.
   Said Bush, ``Iraq's brutality, aggression and violation of
international law cannot be permitted to succeed.''
   ``I find it hard to believe that today, Nov. 8, that he does not
understand that he's up against a determined, unprecedented
alliance,'' he said.
   The president said he believed Saddam ``felt he was going to
have ust an easy time of it'' when he moved into Kuwait. ``There's
where the miscalculation was,'' he said. Bush said the United
States and other countries decided to confront Saddam to guard
against ``some horrible world conflagration'' at a later date.
   Bush said there were no ``mixed signals'' from Moscow.
   Earlier in the day, Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze had
said, ``Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out -
probably this could not be ruled out - and a situation may emerge
which effectively would require such a move.''
   It was the first time the Soviets had indicated publicly they
would at least acquiesce if the United States, which holds the
presidency of the U.N. Security Council this month, attempted to
win passage of a resolution authorizing force against Iraq.
   In the past, Shevardnadze had said the use of force would be
``undesirable.''
   Besides shoring up U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, the new buildup
would make use of tanks and other equipment covered by upcoming
limits on conventional forces that are part of a new arms agreement
to be signed later this month in Paris.
   In addition, Cheney said the Navy will be sending an estimated
three additional aircraft carrier groups, one additional battleship
and an amphibious group.
   He also said several Marine Corps units would be dispatched, and
additional Army mechanized forces, including hundreds of battle
tanks.
   Iraq has more than 400,000 troops in the region.
   Bush said at his morning news conference, ``I've been very clear
that we want to see the sanctions be so successful that we don't
have to have anybody shooting over there. And I've also said we're
not ruling any options out.''
   Referring to the U.S.-led coalition that now confronts Iraq,
Bush said, ``I am determined to hold this coalition together.'' He
promised to ``go the extra mile,'' both in conferring with Congress
at home and with U.S. gulf allies abroad, to make sure that U.N.
resolutions calling for complete and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait are bring results.
   ``The importance of the Baker trip is obvious,'' he added. ``And
I think that the ingredients are there for full support.'' Baker
has consulted with other allies, including the Chinese, in the
course of his current trip.
   Bush said he had ``good support from the American people,'' and
``I'd like to feel the American people would support their
president on whatever decision is made.''

<HEAD>Plan Near, But Officials Edgy About Pension Role</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A long-awaited plan to save Philadelphia
from bankruptcy will be unveiled Friday, but some officials already
are edgy about the role city pension funds might play.
   Bond-rating agencies already have lowered the city's debt to
junk-bond status, the lowest among major U.S. cities.
   State House Speaker Robert W. O'Donnell said Thursday he expects
to announce the plan along with Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other
political leaders.
   The plan is expected to address a short-term cash shortage that
threatens to halt payments to city vendors and employees next
month. It also is expected to address long-term problems
contributing to a projected $206.4 million deficit this year in the
city's $2.19 billion general fund budget.
   The plan's rough outline, leaked in recent days, reportedly
includes a 1 percent local sales tax, spending cuts, sale of
city-owned assets and a financial oversight mechanism outside city
government.
   Pennsylvania has a 6 percent sales tax but the city does not
have one of its own.
   To avert the cash shortage, the plan reportedly includes a
short-term borrowing of up to $350 million from the city's $1.5
billion pension fund, the state treasury and local banks.
   Several of the steps would require approval by City Council and
the state Legislature. Officials also have sought higher state
support for court costs and for programs that serve abused and
neglected children.
   O'Donnell refused to discuss details and said many of them could
change once they reach lawmakers.
   ``What we've done is go down into details far enough to get a
sense that it can be done, without specifying as part of the
agreement that this is the way it will be done.'' he said. The
sales tax, for example, could end up being another type of tax, as
long as it accomplishes the same goal, he said.
   The city was snubbed by Wall Street in September when it tried
to float $375 million in temporary loan notes. The money was needed
to tide the city over until spring, when payments from two of its
three major taxes are due.
   Bond-rating agencies have urged city and state leaders to
cooperate to find permanent solutions.
   ``Failure to address Philadelphia's financial crisis with
concerted action is likely to result in non-payment of debt service
and the elimination of basic services necessary for the protection
of people and property,'' Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. warned in
September.
   Current state law prohibits the city Board of Pensions and
Retirement from investing in junk bonds, as the city's debt is now
rated. City Councilman David Cohen and 11 fellow Democrats proposed
an ordinance Thursday that would allow the board to invest in
Philadelphia notes, regardless of quality.
   ``In my book, the obligations of the city of Philadelphia are
extremely high quality. We have never defaulted,'' Cohen said.
   A public hearing on the bill is scheduled for next Wednesday and
it could become law as early as Nov. 21, Cohen said.
   At the urging of labor organizations, the pension board's
investment committee voted Thursday to hire an outside attorney to
determine if board members legally could approve an investment in
unrated Philadelphia notes.
   Joseph Herkness, who represents the city's unionized white
collar workers on the pension board, said he could only back such
an investment if no other alternative existed to avoid payless
paydays for city workers and vendors.
   City Controller Jonathan Saidel would back the pension board's
purchase of Philadelphia notes as long as a permanent solution was
in place to end city deficits, Deputy City Controller David Volpe
said.
   City Councilwoman Joan Krajewski said she doubts the investment
would be a good risk for pension funds. ``No way should we touch
anyone's pension, no way,'' she said.

<HEAD>California Issues Plan to Warn Public of Imminent Quakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California emergency officials Thursday
issued the nation's first detailed plan for warning the public of
imminent earthquakes and valid quake predictions.
   Scientists still can't predict exactly when and where a quake
will occur. But the new plan reflects scientists' growing ability
to use historic patterns of seismic activity to identify times and
places where odds of a damaging earthquake are greater than usual.
   The 140-page Short-Term Earthquake Prediction Response Plan
spells out how scientists and officials will warn the public of
such situations, as well as policies and procedures for responding
to predictions, the state Office of Emergency Services said.
   The plan was released during a meeting of 180 Southern
California government officials. The conference was designed to
help them learn how to protect public safety when the state
endorses an earthquake prediction or issues a formal warning,
called an advisory, that a dangerous quake may be imminent.
   ``There is no other state - or even the federal government -
that has such a formal plan to respond to earthquake predictions
and forecasts,'' said Richard Andrews, the emergency agency's chief
deputy director.
   Andrews said the plan sharply contrasts with the depiction of
state emergency officials in NBC's mini-series, ``The Big One: The
Great Los Angeles Earthquake,'' that will be broadcast nationwide
Sunday and Monday nights. In the movie, a state official tries to
suppress a quake prediction to protect real estate interests.
   ``The very clear policy of the state of California is that
scientific conclusions and validated earthquake predictions will be
issued to the government and public in a systematic way,'' Andrews
said.
   Research by the U.S. Geological Survey shows that after any
quake in California, there is a 6 percent chance of a larger quake
within a few days.
   After several quakes in recent years, state officials used that
knowledge to issue advisories that there was an increased chance of
a larger quake within three to five days.
   The new plan contains specific procedures state emergency
officials will use to consult with scientists and issue future
quake advisories, hopefully within two hours of a quake that may be
a foreshock to a seismic disaster.
   Andrews said such warnings will allow county and city officials
to activate emergency operations centers, charge up emergency
generators, evacuate high-risk buildings, close schools, and urge
people to stay home.
   The plan also specifies how the Office of Emergency Services and
the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council will
evaluate and respond to quake predictions.
   The response could range from declaring the prediction invalid
to endorsing a prediction by issuing a formal warning or even
urging the governor to declare a state of emergency to prepare for
possible imminent disaster.
   Studies of public reaction to warnings of hurricanes and other
disasters show residents will not panic in response to a quake
warning, but will take appropriate steps to prepare, said Denis
Mileti, a Colorado State University sociologist. He is chairman of
the National Academy of Sciences' natural disasters committee.
   California officials issued two earthquake advisories in 1988
and 1989 after quakes over magnitude 5 on the Richter scale
ruptured the San Andreas Fault in Northern California's Santa Cruz
Mountains.
   Those advisories expired without a larger quake. But the same
section of the fault finally gave way in the magnitude 7.1 Loma
Prieta quake that killed more than five dozen people and caused at
least $7 billion in damage in the San Francisco Bay area in October
1989.
   Andrews and others credited the warnings for raising the level
of preparedness in the region, averting even greater destruction
when the larger quake hit.

   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we're - well, I think from talking to Jim
Baker and recently to President Mubarak that we are in total sync
with him. But I hope that the sanctions will work within a
two-month period. But I don't think we've got a difference with
Egypt on this at all, Terry.
   Q: The question is, how long are you willing to give -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I can't tell you how long. I'm not going
to - if I - if I knew, I certainly wouldn't want to signal that to
- to Saddam Hussein.
   Yeah, John?
   Q: Prime Minister Thatcher said yesterday that if indeed Saddam
doesn't withdraw from Kuwait, that you and the allies will use
force. I haven't heard you say that before. You've talked about
wanting to retain the option of force, but would you use force?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I - I don't want to go - to say what I
will or will not do. But certainly I noted what Prime Minister
Thatcher said - one of the strongest members of this coalition. And
she's an eloquent spokesman for her views and speaks in a way that
shows that we're all together.
   So I have not ruled out the use of force at all and I think
that's evident by what we're doing here today.
   Q: Sir, can I just follow that up by - by going back to a speech
you gave at the Pentagon back in August, when you talked about oil,
affecting the Middle East oil reserves. You talked about American
jobs, in fact the American way of life being endangered.
   Yet when you went out on the campaign trail, you seemed to shy
away from oil. You said demonstrators don't seem to understand that
we're not going to go to war for oil. But that was one of the
things you talked about and, in fact, isn't oil part of the
American national interest? Isn't that a main reason we're there?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: It is a part of it, but it is not the main
reason, or I'd say a main reason. A main reason we're there is to
set back aggression, to see that aggression is unrewarded.
   My argument with some of the protests is that they seem to
focus, to suggest that oil is the sole reason that we are involved
in this enormous commitment, and that is simply not correct.
   There's a lot of other interests, and the restoration of the
security and stability in the Persian Gulf region clearly relates
to the world's economic interests. I'm not denying that and I'm not
backing away from the fact that all the Western world has, you
know, a real interest in that. But that - my argument with those
people is that they are missing the point. The point is, it is the
aggression against Kuwait that has caused this coalition to come
together as it has.
   Yeah, Ann.
   Q: Do you feel that you are free to take offensive action
without any kind of U.N. resolution authorizing it?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes. We have the authority, but we've - we've
been great believers in going to the United Nations. And I think
one of the major successes has been the ability to have world
opinion totally on our side because of U.N. action. The
peacekeeping function of the United Nations has indeed been
rejuvenated by the actions of the Security Council.
   Way in the back, because I've been accused by a distinguished
senior reporter of not getting into the back of the room, so I'd
like to rectify that.

<HEAD>Brando Says Prosecutors Too Tough on His Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando accused
prosecutors in Los Angeles of putting too much pressure on his
daughter, Cheyenne, saying she is too troubled to give credible
testimony about her lover's murder.
   Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner and his deputy, Steven
Barshop, ``exceeded their ethical obligations ... for political and
professional gains,'' Brando charged in a statement. ``I hold them
directly responsible for the physical and mental state in which she
now is in.''
   The statement was released Wednesday by a family spokesman in
Tahiti, where Miss Brando, 20, is hospitalized while recovering
from a drug overdose. Brando has said he would like to fly here to
visit her, but his statement didn't say when that might happen.
   Miss Brando has given six contradictory versions of what
happened the night of May 16, when her 26-year-old lover, Dag
Drollet, was shot to death at the Brando home in Southern
California, Brando said in the statement.
   Miss Brando's brother, Christian Brando, 32, is charged with
murder, and she is considered the key witness in the case.
   Brando said his daughter had been under ``extraordinary
pressure'' to return to the United States to testify although she
could not be a credible witness.
   A month after Drollet was shot, Miss Brando left the United
States for Tahiti, where she gave birth to a child. French
authorities, who accuse her of being an accessory to the murder,
had refused to allow her to be returned to California.
   Miss Brando was hospitalized after ingesting a large dose of
tranquilizers and anti-depressents on Nov. 1.
   Christian Brando had been scheduled to go on trial this week,
but the proceedings were delayed while the court reviews Miss
Brando's status.

<HEAD>Corn Harvest Estimated at a Four-Year High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers are closing in on a 1990 corn harvest
estimated at a four-year high of 7.93 billion bushels, up 5 percent
from last year but down slightly from prospects last month, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The latest outlook, based on Nov. 1 indications, was down 1
percent from the department's October forecast. The harvest was
about 64 percent completed by Oct. 28, only slightly behind normal.
   ``Many growers continue to report yields lower than previously
anticipated,'' the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said.
``Ears in late-planted fields in Indiana did not fill out. Corn
borers also did considerable damage in Illinois.''
   Farmers harvested 7.53 billion bushels in 1989, and the
department in its initial 1990 forecast Aug. 9 put this fall's
harvest at 7.85 billion bushels.
   The forecast was raised on Sept. 12 to 8.12 billion bushels and
then lowered to 8.02 billion on Oct. 11.
   At 7.93 billion bushels, this year's harvest still would be the
largest since farmers produced 8.23 billion bushels in 1986,
according to USDA records.
   Based on the latest surveys, the average corn yield nationally
was estimated at 119 bushels per acre harvested, compared with
116.2 last year and 120.3 indicated last month. The record was
119.4 bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.9 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels but 4 percent more than the
October forecast of 1.82 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.9 million bales, up 22
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales and 2 percent
more than the October forecast.
   No new estimates of 1990 production of wheat and other crops
harvested earlier were included in the report.
   The fall crop of potatoes was estimated for the first time this
season at 342 million hundredweight, up 5 percent from last year
due to an increase in acreage. Average yields were forecast at 298
hundredweight per acre, down one hundredweight from 1989.
   ``Drought in North Dakota and Minnesota cut into production
potential for the third straight year,'' the report said. ``Maine
farmers were hit by heavy October rains followed by hard freezes
late in the month that virtually shut down harvest operations.''
   The potato outlook also was said to be hurt by ``extremely
variable temperatures'' in Idaho, Oregon and Washington during the
growing season.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, analysts said total corn
use in the 1990-91 marketing year, which began Sept. 1, is expected
to be about 8.045 billion bushels.
   With use exceeding estimated production, the U.S. corn stockpile
may decline to a projected 1.236 billion bushels by Sept. 1, 1991,
compared with 1.344 billion this Sept. 1.
   The report said corn prices at the farm may average $2.20 to
$2.60 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, down from $2.36 in
1989-90 and unchanged from the October projection.
   Soybean prices were indicated to average $5.35 to $6.35 per
bushel, down from the October range of $5.70 to $7 per bushel.
   This fall's larger crop is putting pressure on prices and will
mean a rise in soybean stockpiles in 1990-91. By next Sept. 1, the
report said, soybean inventories could be around 255 million
bushels, compared with 239 million bushels this Sept. 1 and last
month's projection of 175 million bushels next year.
   The report also showed the Soviet Union's grain harvest at 235
million metric tons this year, unchanged from the October forecast.
However, analysts said Soviet grain imports in 1990-91 now are
expected to be 28 million tons, down from 30 million anticipated
last month.
   An all-crops production index was reported at 112 percent of the
1977 average used for comparison, up one percentage point from
October and the highest reading since the index averaged 116
percent in 1985.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Nov. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   -Sorghum, 559.8 million bushels and an average yield of 60.5
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   -Rice, 154.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,499 pounds
per acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   -Peanuts, 3.45 billion pounds and a yield of 1,949 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   -Tobacco, 1.6 billion pounds and a yield of 2,198 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   -Sugar beets, 27 million tons and a yield of 19.7 tons per acre,
compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   -Sugar cane, 25.3 million tons and a yield of 35.3 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

   About 300 anti-royalists marched in the
capital's streets by torchlight on Thursday, the Queen's birthday
and eve of a new constitution stripping the king of absolute power.
   The demonstrators chanted slogans against King Birendra, whom
they accused of delaying the reforms prompted by mass pro-democracy
demonstrations last year.
   ``Down with the palace conspiracy!'' the protesters shouted.
   Queen Aishwarya's birthday is a public holiday, but her 42nd
birthday Thursday lacked the pomp and splendor of previous
holidays.
   There were no special functions at the royal palace, and the
state-run media did not run programs praising her contributions to
the nation, as in the previous years.
   The king aroused anger among democracy advocates when he revised
the constitution submitted by the government in a bid to preserve
some power and maintain the monarchy. Further negotiations cleared
the way for the proclamation of the new constitution Friday.

   A Transportation Department task force will
study how to shorten rail passenger travel time between Boston and
New York, Secretary Samuel K. Skinner announced Thursday.
   The federal task force will assign priorities to projects to
improve service between the two cities, Skinner said.
   Scheduled for completion by next summer, the task force will
also develop ``logical cost allocations'' for improvements among
interested state governments, local transportation authorities and
private parties, he said.
   ``Now that the Washington-New York portion of the northeast
corridor has been improved, we need to turn our attention to the
New York-Boston segment,'' Skinner told a meeting of the Railway
Progress Institute.
   ``Facilities and services need to be upgraded to improve the
travel time on the New York-Boston run and to enhance the commuter
services that share the right of way with Amtrak,'' Skinner said.
   ``Speedy and reliable rail service would encourage more
passengers to use the trains and this could help to relieve some of
the congestion in the major airports in the Northeast,'' he said.
   The departmental study, expected to cost $1 million, will be
headed by Gil Carmichael, administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, and Brian W. Clymer, administrator of the Urban
Mass Transit Administration.

<HEAD>Former Head of Pacific Stock Exchange Dead at 61</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maurice Mann, former chairman of the
Pacific Stock Exchange, died of a heart attack while on an airplane
en route to an investors conference. He was 61.
   Mann was flying from Miami to San Diego when he died Wednesday.
   James Cirona, president of Federal Home Loan Bank in San
Francisco, who had breakfast with Mann last week, said Mann was
``full of new ideas.''
   During his three years at the helm of the Pacific Stock
Exchange, Mann recognized the interdependence of the Pacific Basin
and began forging relationships with other exchanges in the region.
   His tenure on the stock exchange, from 1987 until January,
included the Dow Jones Industrial Average's record crash plunge in
October 1987. Mann took control of the situation, holding eight
news conferences in a week and delivering the calming message that
despite ``one of the most significant events in U.S. financial
history ... the system is still working.''
   Before joining the exchange, he was vice chairman of Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets and president and chief executive officer of
the Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco.
   As president of the Federal Home Loan Bank office, he introduced
lending products to give member thrifts more flexibility to deal
with the coming deregulation.
   ``He was very innovative in an industry that had not shown much
innovation,'' said Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco. ``He told them their world was changing that
would make their life more difficult.''
   During the early years of the Nixon administration, Mann was
assistant director of the office of management and budget. Before
that, he was vice president and economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of Cleveland.
   The native of Peabody, Mass., Mann is survived by his wife,
Betty, two daughters, a grandchild and a sister.

<HEAD>Insurance Exec Says School Health Clinics Should Expand Services</HEAD>

   School health clinics should open their
doors to infants, toddlers and pregnant women as a way of helping
children begin their education ready to learn, an insurance
official said Thursday.
   ``The pressing challenge to our corporations, our schools and
our partnerships in education is to give our poorest children a
strong start for a productive life in a highly competitive world,''
said F. Peter Libassi, senior vice president of the Hartford,
Conn.-based Travelers Cos.
   Millions of children, he said, enter kindergarten in poor health
because they don't receive medical care during infancy. Poverty and
poor health are major barriers to learning, he said.
   ``Starting to reform education even at the kindergarten level is
still not close enough to the heart of the problem,'' Libassi said
at a national symposium on education initiatives sponsored by the
National Association of Partners in Education.
   ``Now the question is, `Is it possible ... for our health
clinics that are in our schools to be available, not only to the
school-age child but to the pre-school-age child in the
neighborhood?''' he said.
   School clinics also could provide prenatal care, he said.
   Libassi said the city of Hartford may embark on a program to
expand primary health care and preventive services in neighborhood
health centers and schools.
   A local hospital board is considering a proposal to create a new
children's fund to finance the program using $25 million of the
hospital's endowment. The Hartford business community has pledged
$10 million, he said.
   A 1987 study found one-fourth of all Hartford kindergarten
children were not ready or able to go on to first grade. In one
school, that number was more than 40 percent.
   The American Academy of Pediatrics said about 16 million
children and adolescents through age 21 have no health insurance
and that 26 percent of women in their childbearing years, ages
15-44, have no insurance coverage for maternity care.
   The National Association of Partners in Education is an
organization of 7,000 schools, businesses, community groups,
educators and volunteers working to help students achieve
educational excellence.

   Q: Mr. President -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Yes, sir. No - him.
   Q: Do you yet have the support you need in order to secure an
additional resolution from the U.N. Security Council to explicitly
authorize the use of force? Do you now have the sufficient support
on the Security Council -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I'd - I - I would say that the Baker mission is
- what it is about is consultation. That subject will be discussed
in some ways. I'm sure that that's not why he's there. We're
talking about a wide array of issues. And so, I'd say we have not
tried to specifically poll the 15 members - or the other 14 members
of the Security Council along those lines, so I can't answer
whether we would or not.
   Q: If I may follow, has any country told you they would block
such a resolution?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Not - none - some may have said such a thing but
I've not - I've not - it's not been brought to my attention at all.
And I - again, I think I'd know if that were the case, but I don't
think so.
   Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, it would seem that the situation at the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait is crucial to the future of the overall situation
in the Gulf. What is the latest there? What is the situation with
their food and water supplies? And do you plan - have anything in
the works now to resupply them?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well I think it's unconscionable to try to
starve people out and to isolate them from food and supplies of all
kinds, and that's exactly what's going on. In terms of how long
they can survive I'm not sure I could give you a specific answer,
but I believe the answer would be a few weeks, something of that
nature.
   Q: Are there plans to resupply them when they run out or -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, if there were, given the hostile
environment in which these people are living, it would be
unproductive to discuss it.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, what has happened in the last two weeks that
has led you to put now an offensive force into Saudi Arabia?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we have - we have not only offensive but
defensive forces there already. And what leads me to do this is
just because I believe - upon the advice of our able secretary of
defense and others - that this is in the best security interests of
our people that are there and of the coalition.
   I think it is the best - I think it is just a guarantee of the
safety of all and I think it sends a very strong signal, another
strong signal, to Saddam Hussein that we are very, very serious
about the success of the United - to seeing the United Nations
resolutions complied to in their entirety without - without any
kind of watering down.
   Q: Sir, would you say that we're in a critical phase now between
a peaceful solution and possible armed conflict?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I wouldn't phrase it that way.
   Q: Mr. President, the longer that you wait, or the longer that
no action is taken in Kuwait the less and less there's seems to be
of Kuwait.
   What's the point of waiting if there's not going to be anything
left of that country when you finally decide to go in?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I've told you that I want to - I would
like to feel that Saddam Hussein would come to his senses and
comply, under economic pressure, with the sanctions that have been
taken in the United Nations and with the objectives.
   I would like to think the sanctions - economic sanctions would
compel him to do that which he has been unwilling to do.
   Regrettably, he keeps reiterating his view that this is - this
is not Kuwait, but Province 19, and that is unacceptable to the
United States and to our partners.
   So it's - I think we're giving these sanctions time to work.
We're giving world opinion time to mobilize, and impress on him
that - that we're all serious and that - but now we're moving up
our forces, for the reasons I've given you.

<HEAD>Panamanian Journalists Protest Press Laws</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALINA GUERRERO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 journalists marched
silently down the city's main street Thursday and picketed the
presidential palace to protest press laws carried over from the
deposed regime of Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   President Guillermo Endara, who this week sued a newspaper
columnist, met the journalists outside the palace and angrily
defended a law under which slander is heavily penalized.
   ``The president of the republic is a person and is going to
demand reponsibility when there is an attempt to damage his
honor,'' Endara said. ``That is what I will do in each and every
one of the cases, and there is no persecution.''
   Then he turned his back and refused to accept a protest letter
the journalists had signed.
   Endara, installed after the Dec. 20 American invasion that
overthrew Noriega, has filed a slander and damage complaint against
Dagoberto Franco of the daily El Siglo. Franco was detained for two
days and released on $5,000 bond.
   Franco had written a column entitled, ``Endara: The Great
Swindle.''
   At least 60 formal complaints have been filed against
journalists this year, mostly by officials, the protesters said.
   Journalists are asking that slander be changed from a criminal
to a civil violation. The current penalty is two to five years in
jail.
   In their letter, the journalists said, ``We are here because 21
years of castrated journalism has left us a bitter taste of exiles,
threats, pressures and fears that we never want to repeat.''
   Endara told the journalists: ``I'm not a second-class citizen. I
don't have more privileges than anyone else, but I have equal
rights with you.''
   The constitution provides for freedom of expression but says
there are ``legal responsibilities when by any of these media one
attacks the reputation or honor of the persons in violation of the
social security or public order.''

   Q: After you have consulted - if I might follow up - on this
deployment and in fact on the military situation overall with the
other countries involved in the multi-national forces, there have
been complaints, observations, out of Israel that, were there to be
offensive action, there needs to be coordination or some sort of
chain of command involving the Israelis too, for they may end up
being involved.
   To what extent are you communicating with the Israelis? And to
what extent do you envision any role or possible role for the
Israelis should this come to war?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I think the whole world knows that the
United States is - has a very special relationship with Israel - a
strong relationship. I think we're in close touch with the key
players there in terms of our objectives. And I think they've
conducted themselves in a - regarding all of this - very well
indeed. But I'm not going to discuss any more details than that.
But I - I feel that we're on a good wavelength there.
   Q: Mr. President -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: We have some differences obviously. Really I got
just - one and one and then I've got to go.
   Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, to follow up -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I recognize him on the aisle - go ahead. Yes,
you and Ellen and then -
   Q: - to follow up on Wyatt's question, after Foreign Minister
Shevardnaze made his comments today, President Gorbachev seemed to
say that it was too early to talk about the use of force.
   Are the Soviets sending us mixed signals?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No.
   Q: Is this an indication that - like President Mubarak made
earlier in the week - that some of our allies want more time to try
to find a diplomatic solution before use of force?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I don't - I don't get the feeling we're getting
any mixed signals at all from the Soviets, particularly after I've
talked to - to Jim Baker. I know there was some feeling there were
mixed signals because of Mr. Primakov's mission, but as that has -
upon the completion of that - I think people recognize that we are
still very much in accord - in agreement with the Soviet on matters
as it relates to the Gulf.
   So it's good, Ann, and it's strong, and I just can't worry about
that point at all after talking to Jim Baker.
   Q: Does Jim Baker have an explanation for the difference between
Mr. Shevardnadze's remarks and Mr. Gorbachev's remarks today?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, he made the point that if we were together
with them, and that was not discussed - any differences on the -
   Q: Mr. President?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: On the aisle.
   Q: Mr. President -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: No, last one - on the aisle, the lovely
gentleman with the glasses -
   Q: Mr. President, some members of your administration have -
   Q: Mr. President, I have a very important question to ask you.
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Only if you'll yield. Don't you know, in the
Congress they say ``I yield to the distinguished lady from Texas,''
but if you don't want to yield, I'm sorry - I've recognized the
gentleman.
   Q: Mr. President, some members of your -
   Q: I was expecting to yield but I would expect (inaudible) -
   (Laughter.)
   Q: Some members of your administration -
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Sarah, I've disappointed you so much. Please go
ahead.
   Q: Some of members of your administration are convinced that
Saddam Hussein will not move until he is - until the 11th hour or
11:59, when he is totally convinced that you are about to use
military force. Why is he not convinced now, do you think? Why -
how do you expect that you will be able to get to that 11:59 in a
minute?

<HEAD>Sharon Asks Jewish Control over Temple Mount</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon asked Israel on
Thursday to establish Jewish control over Jerusalem's sacred Temple
Mount, now under Moslem control, and to expand Jewish neighborhoods
in annexed east Jerusalem.
   He told members of his Likud bloc in Tel Aviv these measures
were needed to ``stop deterioration in the security situation,'' a
Sharon spokesman said in a statement carried by the national Itim
news agency.
   On Oct. 8, police shot and killed 20 Palestinians during a riot
on the mount, revered by Arabs as Islam's third holiest site and by
Jews as the site of their ancient temple.
   ``There must be Jewish rule on the Temple Mount. The Temple
Mount is the root of the problem,'' Sharon said.
   He also said leaders of the Palestinian ``terrorism and
uprising'' must be deported, naming prominent pro-PLO activists
Faisal Husseini and Sari Nusseibeh and Gaza Strip leaders Fayez
Abu-Rahme and Issam Saftawi.
   In statements broadcast on Israel television, Sharon also
demanded expulsion of thousands of Palestinians living in the
Israeli Arab villages.
   Sharon is a leading hawk in Likud, the governing right-wing bloc
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. A hero of the 1973 Middle East
war, he later became defense minister and was an architect of
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   The mount in Jerusalem's walled Old City, called Haram al-Sharif
by Moslems, is zealously controlled by Islamic religious
authorities. The Oct. 8 events were ignited, in part, by rumors
that Jews planned to take over the site.
   Sharon asked that Jewish neighborhoods in Jerusalem be expanded,
``with a special effort in east Jerusalem.'' About 120,000 Arabs
live in the annexed part of the city, captured by Israel from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
   He blamed occasional pro-Palestinian riots and the rising
nationalist feelings among Israel's 800,000 Arabs on the presence
of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, who he said dwell in
Arab villages in northern Israel without a permit.
   Most Israeli Arabs support Palestinian independence demands and
the 35-month-old uprising in the occupied lands.
   Despite support for the 1.7 million of their brethren in the
occupied areas, Israeli Arabs say they remain loyal citizens of
Israel.
   Also on Thursday:
   -Ethiopian Jewish emigration resumed after a lapse of four
months, with 103 Ethiopians arriving in Israel. Israel radio
reported from Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv that the group
included many sick and elderly people, and that many kissed the
ground after getting off a plane that brought them to the Jewish
state via Rome. Israeli officials estimate 22,000 Jews remain in
Ethiopia.
   -Legislator Yair Tzaban of the leftist Mapam party proposed that
Parliament adopt a law stipulating a prison sentence of up to five
years for anyone attacking a journalist. The proposal came a day
after several journalists were attacked or stoned during the
funeral of Rabbi Meir Kahane, the leader of the anti-Arab Kach
party assassinated in New York by an Arab.

<HEAD>Accused Mail Bomber Refuses to Enter Plea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man charged in mail bombings that killed a
federal judge and a lawyer refused Thursday to enter a plea,
pending his attempt to bar any federal judge from hearing the case.
   In a hearing before a federal magistrate, lawyers for Walter
Leroy Moody Jr. said the fact that a federal judge was one of the
victims damages the impartiality of all federal judges.
   Moody's attorneys requested in a court motion that the Senate
Judiciary Committee appoint an independent officer to hear the
case.
   U.S. Magistrate William Harper referred the case to U.S.
District Judge Richard Freeman for trial. No hearing was scheduled
on the motion. An innocent plea was automatically entered for Moody
because of his refusal to enter a plea.
   Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Shapiro would not comment
on the motion, which said every federal judge in the country has
altered working habits and lifestyles because of the mail bombings
last year.
   A federal indictment issued Wednesday includes a murder charge
against Moody in the slaying of Judge Robert Vance in Alabama and
explosives charges related to the death of Georgia civil rights
lawyer Robert Robinson.
   Alabama officials said Moody, 56, may also face state murder
charges and the death penalty in the slaying of Vance, a member of
the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Authorities in Georgia said they have not seen enough of the
evidence, most of it developed by federal authorities, to decide
whether to press state charges against him in the death of Robinson
in Savannah.
   The murder charge in te 70-count indictment carries a maximum
penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. No murder charge was
included for Robinson's death. Moody was charged with transporting
explosive material with intent to kill in that death. The charge
also carries a maximum penalty of life and $250,000.
   Moody also is charged with a variety of other offenses related
to the bombings. If convicted on all 70 counts he could face seven
life terms plus 385 years in prison and fines of $16.9 million.
   Jimmy Evans, Alabama's attorney general-elect and currently
Montgomery County district attorney, said because Moody is a
federal prisoner there would be no petition to extradite him to
Alabama. Instead, the state would ``borrow'' Moody from federal
authorities long enough to prosecute him, Evans said.
   He favors pursuing the death penalty if feasible.
   ``My thought is that the person responsible for the murder of
the late Robert Vance should be tried capitally and put in the
electric chair. Whoever is guilty for this should receive the
maximum penalty and punishment,'' Evans said.
   Current Alabama Attorney General Don Siegelman said, however,
that if Moody is acquitted in the federal trial, there would be
little use in trying him in Alabama.
   In Georgia, Chatham County District Attorney Spencer Lawton Jr.
said he has not seen enough evidence in the Robinson death to
determine whether to pursue a murder charge against Moody.
   Lawton said that after the first few days following the Savannah
explosion, federal authorities took over the investigation almost
exclusively.
   ``Since then we've taken no substantial role in the
investigation,'' Lawton said. ``The net of all this is I am totally
unaware of the factual basis for the federal indictment.''
   Lawton said Wednesday he was trying to contact federal
authorities to gain access to evidence that would help him decide
whether to seek local charges against Moody.
   Roger Brown, assistant district attorney in Jefferson County,
Ala., where Vance was killed at his home, said he, too, planned to
review the federal evidence to determine if local prosecutors would
get involved.

   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I'm not sure I accept the 11:59 analogy,
but if there has ever been any doubt in his mind about the
seriousness of the West and of the other Arab countries and of the
coalition - put it that way - I think that those doubts are rapidly
being dispelled.
   You see, I do believe that when he moved into Kuwait, I think he
felt he was going to have just an easy time of it and that the
world would not rise up in arms against the aggression. I think he
miscalculated there. I believe he thought he could just take over
Kuwait and then there'd be a lot of talk and discussion, and he
would be able to turn Kuwait, a sovereign nation, a member of the
Arab League, a member of the United Nations, into Province 19.
   And the United States, along with other countries, said ``No,
we're not going to permit this aggression to stand because an
unchecked aggression today could lead to some horrible world
conflagration tomorrow.''
   And so I think there's where the miscalculation originally was.
I find it hard to believe that today, November 8th, he does not
understand that he's up against a determined, unprecedented
alliance. And so I hope that he is rethinking his position of
unyielding - of unyielding opposition to the will of the rest of
the world.
   And I would think that when he surveys the force that's there,
this force that's going, what other countries are doing in this
regard, he will recognize that he is up against a - just an - a foe
that he can't possibly manage militarily. And Margaret Thatcher
touched on that yesterday and I thought she did it very well
indeed.
   And so if nothing else happens, I'm convinced that this move
will show him how serious we are as a significant partner in this
coalition. And I think it's a good thing. It has - will have strong
support from others around the world. And let's hope he comes to
his senses and does tomorrow that which he should have done weeks
ago, because this aggression simply will not stand.
   Now, Dick, it's all yours.
   SECRETARY CHENEY: As the president indicated, we've got a
briefing scheduled in the Pentagon for General Powell and myself in
a few minutes to fill out the details of the decision the
president's made today, but I'd be happy to respond to a couple of
questions.
   Q: How many troops are being sent and how many -
   SECRETARY CHENEY: We have - let me address the question of
numbers. We have consistently, since the very beginning of this
operation in August, three months ago, indicated that we were not
going to put a number on the deployment. As we have achieved a
certain level of deployment we've reported that we've had 150,000
or 200,000; today we're at 230,000-plus. We will not put an upper
limit on this deployment.
   We started the flow back in August, and what the president has
directed me to do today is to assign additional units to go to the
Gulf, and it is a considerable additional increment of U.S. force,
involves additional heavy divisions as well as naval and air
forces.
   And we'll announce -
   Q: Coming from where?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: Coming from both Europe and the United States.
And we will announce those details in a few minutes.
   Michael?
   Q: Mr. Secretary, in Europe we waited 40 years for economic
pressures to lead the Soviet Union to withdraw its forces from
Eastern Europe despite a number of aggressions. Why shouldn't we
wait a year or so for economic sanctions to take hold in Iraq and
lead the Iraqis to leave Kuwait?
   And if we're prepared to wait, why should we send such a large
force at this time, since it's harder to sustain a large force in
the desert than a somewhat smaller force?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: Well, the directions I've been given by the
president are, I think, very clear-cut. That is to say that we're
to continue the policy that's currently in force, that the military
units that are in the Gulf region are there to deter further
aggression, to defend should deterrence fail, to enforce the
sanctions.
   We are also now obviously deploying, as the president mentioned
in his statement, sufficient additional force to make certain that
should circumstances warrant that we will have the capacity to
undertake offensive military action as well. The decision about how
long we wait and how much time we're willing to give sanctions to
work is something that'll be made above my pay grade.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, there are reports that Saddam Hussein fired
his military chief of staff today. What is going on? Is there
dissension in the ranks? And does that have something to do with
the timing of these news conferences, to try to keep international
pressure on him?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: I have seen the reports that he's changed out
his chief of staff. I don't have any special knowledge as to why
that occurred and our announcements are totally unrelated to those
developments.
   In the back?
   Q: Mr. Secretary, could you give us a range: When does this
deployment begin? When do you expect it to end?

   A lawyer who favors liberalizing strict
laws on birth control and abortion appeared in a strong position
Thursday to become Ireland's first woman president, according to
partial and unofficial returns.
   Mary Robinson trailed former deputy prime minister Brian Lenihan
in the preliminary count, but pre-election polls indicated the
second round on Friday would put her over the top.
   ``It looks like President Robinson now,'' said Justice Minister
Ray Burke, who had supported Lenihan, a member of the dominant
Fianna Fail party.
   ``It's looking good, but it's not by any manner or means decided
yet,'' said Mrs. Robinson, whose supporters staged early
celebrations. She was nominated by the Labor and Workers party,
although she has no party affiliation.
   As president, she would be expected to refrain from any
political controversies. The president's main powers are the right
to dissolve Parliament when a government has lost support, and to
refer legislation to the Supreme Court.
   On Thursday night, unofficial returns showed Lenihan with 44.1
percent of the vote, Mrs. Robinson with 38.9 percent and Austin
Currie of Fine Gael with 17 percent, according to Press
Association, the British news agency.
   Turnout was estimated at 63 percent of the 2.47 million eligible
voters, compared with 68 percent in parliamentary elections last
year.
   Under the Irish system, voters mark a second preference on their
ballots. In the second round, Currie stands to be eliminated and
his votes distributed among the two top finishers.
   A poll published Tuesday in The Irish Times indicated Currie's
supporters preferred Mrs. Robinson by 3-to-1 over Lenihan. Currie
had urged his supporters to make her their second choice.
   Former Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Fine Gael said on
Irish Radio that he expected Mrs. Robinson to finish with 52
percent of the vote.
   Mrs. Robinson, 46, would be the first leftist candidate to be
president of Ireland, and the first since 1945 who didn't come from
Fianna Fail.
   She is a lecturer in European Community law at Trinity College
in Dublin, and has supported more liberal contraception laws,
legalized divorce and the right of women to obtain information
about abortion, which is outlawed in Ireland but available in
Britain.
   Lenihan, 59, was first elected to Parliament in the 1960s, and
has held several Cabinet posts.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey was forced to dismiss Lenihan as
deputy prime mininster and defense minister last week to save his
coalition government from collapse.
   Lenihan was accused of lying about a his role in a 1982 attempt
to keep President Patrick Hillery from calling a national election.
   Lenihan quickly dropped from frontrunner to second place in
opinion polls.
   Currie, 51, was a leader in the Catholic civil rights campaign
in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the main Catholic party there. He moved
to the Irish Republic and was elected last year to the Dail, the
lower house of Parliament.
   All three candidates are Catholics.
   It is Ireland's first contested presidential election in 17
years.

   Advisories and watches for winter-like weather in various parts
of the nation expired Thursday and rain splattered areas from
Oregon to New York state.
   New Mexico got some relief after a storm dumped snow in every
corner of the state. Up to 6 inches of snow covered various areas,
including the northeast heights of Albuquerque.
   Winds gusted to 50 and 60 mph across Wyoming's southeast
mountains. An advisory for strong winds causing blowing and
drifting snow was posted for the region.
   A high wind warning was posted for Kodiak, Alaska, where 45-mph
winds gusted to near 75 mph.
   Strong winds and low wind chills were expected to linger through
Friday around Valdez, Alaska. Winds gusted to near 60 mph and the
morning wind chill was 25 to 35 degrees below zero.
   Rain or occasional thundershowers reached over much of Texas,
Oklahoma, northwest Louisiana, southern Arkansas, eastern Kansas,
northwest Missouri and southern Iowa.
   Rain also extended across northwest Oregon and from southwest
Idaho into northwest Idaho. Rain changed to snow over southeast
Idaho. Snow was scattered in central Colorado, northwest Wisconsin,
south-central New York state and northern Maine.
   The nation's low Thursday morning was 4 degrees below zero at
Alamosa, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 25
degrees at Caribou and Limestone in Maine to 88 degrees at Fort
Myers airport in Florida.

   SECRETARY CHENEY: I signed the deployment orders this morning.
Some of the forces had previously been alerted to be ready to
deploy, so in effect, the deployment actually begins today. It will
obviously, given the size of the deployment, be something that will
run over a significant additional period of time. I wouldn't want
to be more precise than that. We've always refrained from
indicating when a particular unit would be deployed and
combat-ready.
   Clear in the back?
   Q: Does this deployment involve a further call-up of reserves,
and has there been consultation with congressional leaders today on
this deployment?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: The answer is it will involve an additional
call-up of reserves, and there have been notifications to members
of Congress. I personally talked with the leadership and the
chairmen and ranking members of all of the key Armed Services and
Appropriations committees.
   Q: As you increase your deployments, will you be able to
maintain the promise that I think was made by the joint - the
chairman of the joint chiefs that you would rotate people in and
out every six months?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: We've never made such a promise. We've said
that we were looking at a rotation policy, but the forces that we
are ordering into the area today are not going in there to replace
those that have already been deployed. They are in addition to
those that are already in the area.
   Frank?
   Q: Mr. Secretary, is it safe to say that the message that is
being sent from this room today is that the United State is now
prepared to fight a ground war to force Iraq out of Kuwait if
necessary?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: The message is - as exactly as we've stated
it, and as the President stated it, and that is that our policy is
to see to it that Saddam Hussein complies with the resolutions
voted by the U.N. Security Council.
   Those are our goals and objectives that - we are hopeful that we
can achieve that peacefully; we're hopeful we can achieve that
through the application of the economic sanctions now in force. But
we also have the military option available to us should the other
course of action be unsuccesful.
   One more question and then I've got to run.
   Q: If I may follow up, Mr. Secretary -
   SECRETARY CHENEY: Yes.
   Q: - you've been reluctant - wait just a - Mr. Secretary
   -
   STAFF: On whom did you call?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: The young man with the hair on the - front -
(extensive laughter) -
   Q: Mr. Secretary, do you agree that the winter months are an
optimal time to fight a war in the desert? And is weather
compelling a decision to use force before the sanctions have had -
   SECRETARY CHENEY: I wouldn't want to speculate about future
deadlines of when sanctions will be deemed to have failed, or what
pressures weather and climate considerations might bring to bear.
We are prepared to carry out the president's instructions, and
those instructions are as I've already related.
   One more question. The gentleman I insulted in back, and then
I've got to go. Yes, sir.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, you've been reluctant here to use a number.
The number 100,000 additional troops has been widely used and
widely reported. Is that ballpark accurate?
   SECRETARY CHENEY: I have never used the number 100,000. We've
never announced a number. Until we actually have those additional
forces in theater, we'll continue to pursue that policy. I would
expect they'll be all kinds of numbers rumored, leaked, speculated
about.
   But the fact is, none of them has any official standing. We have
opened up the pipeline to send forces to the Gulf and to Saudi
Arabia in support of Desert Shield, and we are today announcing
that there are additional forces going as part of that overall
effort.
   Thank you very much.

<HEAD>Woman Files $750,000 Lawsuit Against Former Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman whose allegations of sexual
misconduct led to the conviction of former congressman Donald
Lukens has filed a $750,000 lawsuit against him.
   The lawsuit says Lukens, 59, had sexual relations with Rosie
Coffman in 1984 or 1985 when she was 13 and again on Nov. 6, 1988,
when she was 16. She turned 19 Wednesday.
   Ms. Coffman's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Common Pleas Court,
claims the experience continues to cause her ``severe mental
anguish, pain and suffering, emotional distress, humiliation and
psychological injury.''
   ``She has nightmares. She can't forget about it, and that's why
we have laws protecting juveniles,'' said her attorney, W. Jeffrey
Moore.
   In May 1989, Lukens was convicted of contributing to the
unruliness of a minor, stemming from the 1988 incident. Lukens
resigned from Congress on Oct. 24 rather than face new allegations
of sexual misconduct stemming from an alleged incident with a
teen-age congressional employee.
   Lukens could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. A man
who answered the telephone at his Middletown home said Lukens was
planning to move, but would not specify where. There was no answer
at the home Thursday. Lukens' Washington home number has been
changed to an unlisted number.
   Ms. Coffman's mother, Anna Coffman, said the attention and
harassment her daughter has received because of her involvement
with Lukens prompted her to seek a night maintenance job.
   ``She did it so she could stay away from the public,'' the
mother said. ``She can't hold down a daytime job without somebody
pointing the finger at her.''
   Lukens was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $500. He has
been free on bond, pending appeals.
   He ran for re-election but was defeated in the Republican
primary in May.

<HEAD>Computer Hacking Pranks Costs $2.4 Million, Company Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two youthful computer whizzes are accused of
tapping into a company's telephone system to make harassing calls
and bomb threats, causing $2.4 million in damages and lost
business, authorities said.
   John Keary, a New York State Police investigator, said the two
teen-agers experimented with International Data Group's toll-free
number and gained access to the Framingham, Mass., firm's
computerized voice mailbox system.
   The company produces specialty, high-tech magazines like
Computer World.
   Keary said the youths made harassing calls for five months and
replaced business calls and advertising orders left on the mailbox
system with their own fake - and sometimes lewd - messages.
   Daniel Rosenbaum, 17, and a 14-year-old friend, both of New York
City, were charged Monday with computer tampering, unauthorized use
of a computer and aggravated harassment.
   Keary said the two told police they were annoyed at not
receiving a free poster with their subscription to an IDG magazine.
   Olga Greenwood, telecommunications analyst and voice mail
administrator for International Data, said harassing calls also
were made to the firm's Peterborough, N.H., office.
   ``For five months, we've been living a nightmare,'' she said.
   Keary said the pair placed about 700 calls, mostly after working
hours,and changed greetings left on computerized employee
answering machines.
   Greenwood said the name on her message was changed to Marge
Simpson, the mother of the television cartoon family, and her
greeting was changed to a lewd remark.
   Keary said Rosenbaum faced a year in jail if convicted on the
misdemeanor charges. The 14-year-old was charged as a juvenile.

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
plans to nominate his chief of staff, Virendra Dayal of India, as
the next U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, a U.N. spokesman said
Thursday.
   The nomination may be opposed. Norway has its own candidate,
former U.N. Ambassador Tom Vraalsen, to replace the former
commissioner, who was Norwegian.
   Thorvald Stoltenberg resigned last week to become deputy prime
minister in Norway's new government.
   The High Commissioner for Refugees is responsible for about 15
million refugees worldwide, including about 5 million Afghans now
in Pakistan and Iran, about 2 million refugees in southern Africa
and the Horn of Africa.
   The Geneva-based agency has been demoralized by the resignation
of two commissioners in a year's time.
   Perez de Cuellar's spokesman, Francois Giuliani said the U.N.
chief has been conferring with regional group leaders in the
General Assembly on Dayal, the only candidate he is discussing.
   The secretary-general names the commissioner, but the General
Assembly must approve the candidate.
   Dayal has been chief of staff since 1982. From 1979-82, he was
director in the office of the undersecretary-general for special
political affairs. He was a senior official in the UNHCR from
1965-79.
   His intended nomination aroused some opposition among Nordic and
other Western nations, which traditionally provide the UNHCR
nominee.
   U.N. sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Perez de
Cuellar would probably formally announce Dayal despite such
opposition.
   The Western countries would be reluctant to vote against a
candidate from India, a major developing country, they said.
   Stoltenberg served in the post about 11 months, replacing
Jean-Pierre Hocke of Switzerland, who resigned under a cloud in
October 1989.
   Hocke was accused of misusing a special education fund for
refugees to upgrade his air travel to first class, and was accused
by his staff of financial mismanagement and favoritism.
   Hocke admitted using the fund to get better airline seats, but
denied misusing U.N. funds.
   The UNHCR's budget has been stuck for years at a ceiling of
about $550 million, although the number of refugees has grown from
7 million to 15 million in a decade.

   Two assailants on Thursday shot
and killed a Roman Catholic man in a garage in Stewartstown, police
said. He was the second Catholic slain in the province in 24 hours.
   Friends identified the latest victim as Malachy McIvor, in his
early 40s, of Moneymore, in County Londonderry. Police said he had
no known links with the security forces or paramilitary groups.
   On Wednesday night, two men shot and killed Catholic Gary
Campbell, 22, in his Belfast home. He too had no known connection
with the security forces or paramilitary groups, police said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the killings, but police said
they suspected the killers were extremists from this British
province's Protestant majority.
   ``Everybody is living in terrible fear. I fear the IRA will now
retaliate for this murder, and once again an innocent member of the
Protestant community will probably suffer,'' said Denis Faul, a
local Catholic priest.
   On Nov. 2, an Irish Republican Army bomb killed Protestant
Albert Cooper in Cookstown, six miles from Stewartstown. Cooper was
a member of the Ulster Defense Regiment, a part-time security
branch of the army dominated by Protestants.
   A week earlier, also in Cookstown, men shot and killed Tommy
Casey, 57, a member of the outlawed IRA's legal political wing,
Sinn Fein.
   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule and
unite the province with the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of
Ireland under a leftist administration.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Iraq Got Bombs Through Lancaster, Chile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq obtained the technology to make
cluster bombs through a Pennsylvania company that did illegal
business through a Chilean arms dealer, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
   Federal investigators told the Intelligencer Journal in
Lancaster that the technology for the bombs came from the
International Signal &amp; Control Corp., which was started by former
Lancaster businessman James H. Guerin.
   Guerin's business partner, Carlos Cardoen of Chile, subsequently
sold the technology to Iraq in violation of a 1977 law barring
Chile from receiving U.S. military technology, the newspaper said.
   Cluster bombs release hundreds of smaller bombs on impact, or
above a target. The smaller bombs can cover an area equivalent to
10 football fields with shrapnel and incendiary fragments.
   The smaller bombs can detonate at various times, up to 72 hours
after the main bomb has been dropped.
   The newspaper reported previously that Guerin, who now lives in
Naples, Fla., has agreed to plead guilty to fraud for inflating the
value of his company prior to its merger with the British defense
giant Ferranti International PLC.
   Court records also indicate Guerin is under investigation for
illegal arms sales to South Africa and other countries barred from
getting arms from the United States, the newspaper said.
   The cluster bomb technology reached Iraq with help from the
Iraqi-owned, British precision tooling firm Matrix Churchill, the
newspaper reported, citing federal sources it did not identify.
   Nasser Beydoun, Cardoen's former weapons salesman to Iraq and
Libya, told the Intelligencer Journal through his attorney that he
was aware of the sale of cluster bomb technology to Chile as early
as 1983 and its subsequent shipment to Iraq in 1987.
   The newspaper said Cardoen, 48, used his Santiago headquarters
to ship the bombs to Baghdad, via Iraqi Airways or by ship from the
port of Iquique, Beydoun said.
   Much of the planning for the shipments was done from Cardoen's
Miami Lakes subsidiary, Swissco Management Group, Beydoun told the
newspaper.
   Cardoen's attorney in Miami, Abbey Kaplan, would not comment on
Beydoun's claims.
   The newspaper, citing other sources it did not identify, said
Cardoen began contract negotiations with Iraq in 1983 for the sale
of the International Signal-designed cluster bombs. International
Signal is based in Lancaster County.
   A Chilean source told the Intelligencer Journal that Cardoen is
believed to have sold Iraq 20,000 of one kind of cluster bomb for
$7,100 each and 4,000 of another kind of cluster bomb.
   A spokesman for Cardoen spokesman in Santiago denied any
association with ISC, beyond enlisting the help of two of its
engineers to solve a technical problem with a radio-detonated
explosive destined for the Chilean Air Force.
   Sources told the Intelligencer Journal, however, that a
three-man team from ISC suppiled charts, drawings and designs that
Cardoen used to build an Iraq bomb-making plant in 1986-87.
   Cardoen displayed the technology at an arms and air show in
Chile in late March, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Experts Say Saudi Women Drivers Didn't Break Law</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legal and religious experts have
ruled that a group of Saudi women who defied tradition by driving
15 cars through Riyadh did not violate civil or moral laws,
informed sources said Thursday night.
   But the experts assembled by the governor of Riyadh, Prince
Salman Bin Abdel-Aziz, said they shouldn't do it again, the sources
said.
   The protesters won at least a moral victory because the rulings
mean there is no ban in Islamic or civil law to women driving. The
sources predicted women will eventually be allowed to drive in this
conservative Arab country, probably within six months to two years.
   The veiled women, most of them middle-aged and married, startled
this desert kingdom Tuesday by taking the steering wheels in the
first open protest by women here. Fifteen of them drove the cars,
and 35 rode along in support.
   Police stopped the convoy and took the women to a police
station. Saudi officials said they were released after signing a
pledge that they would not repeat their protest elsewhere.
   Many of the women were concerned that if there is a war in Saudi
Arabia, with their husbands away, they will be trapped at home,
said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Although there is no written law barring Saudi women from
driving, they are prohibited from doing so under strict Islamic
tradition.
   During Tuesday's protest, the Saudi religious police, known as
the Committee for Commendation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,
insisted after rounding up the women that they be arrested for
committing a moral offense.
   But King Fahd intervened and told the religious police that the
incident was being investigated by the prominent religious scholars
and legal experts assembled by the governor of Riyadh, the sources
said. They did not disclose the identities of the experts.
   Organizers of the demonstration said many of the women came from
prominent families and had driver's licenses from Europe and the
United States. The women insisted there was nothing political about
their protest.
   At least some members of the Saudi royal family reportedly favor
ending the ban on women driving but have not pushed for it because
of opposition elsewhere in the country.
   Western women drive inside the huge Saudi ARAMCO compound for
oil field workers in Dhahran.
   In addition, uniformed American women soldiers drive military
vehicles as part of their job. The soldiers are in Saudi Arabia as
part of the international force opposing Iraq.

   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A woman defending herself against
charges that she killed her boyfriend denied on Thursday that she
gave him or her two husbands arsenic and disputed witnesses'
descriptions of her as cold.
   ``I've been in jail for 16 months,'' Blanche Taylor Moore
testified. ``I've cried myself to sleep every night, but it's not
to the point everybody in there would know it.''
   The Alamance County grandmother was calm during most of her time
on the stand, but twice broke down.
   ``I know arsenic was found in these three people, but I know
that I didn't do it,'' she said. ``I've never physically harmed
other people. To physically harm a person, no, I did not do that.''
   Mrs. Moore, 57, is being tried on a murder charge in the 1986
arsenic-poisoning death of Raymond Reid.
   She also is charged in the death of her first husband, James
Taylor, and with two counts of assault in the near lethal arsenic
poisoning of her now-estranged husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore. She
will be tried on those charges later.
   Mrs. Moore denied helping Reid draft the will that gave her a
share of his estate.
   ``I had not dictated anything,'' Mrs. Moore testified. ``I had
nothing to do with the writing of that will.''
   Under cross-examination by prosecutor Janet Branch, Mrs. Moore
described the 1973 death of Taylor.
   The night before Taylor died, Mrs. Moore testified, a friend
brought over what he described as holy water in a Dr Pepper bottle
with holes in the cap. She said the friend sprinkled some of the
liquid on Taylor.
   Mrs. Moore testified that Taylor said: ``If this is Dr Pepper
holy water, I'll just drink the whole thing.''
   Mrs. Moore said Taylor drank the liquid and she found him dead
the next morning.
   Defense lawyer Mitchell McEntire asked Mrs. Moore if she ever
bought or sought to buy ant poison.
   ``No,'' Mrs. Moore said. ``I've never had any of it in my home
or in my hands.''
   Earlier witnesses testified Mrs. Moore had tried to buy an ant
poison that contained arsenic.
   The prosecution rested its case Thursday afternoon. Closing
arguments were expected to begin Monday.

<HEAD>Sandinista Chief Offers to Take Action Against Former Rebels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista defense chief offered
Thursday to clear out Contra rebels who have blocked access to much
of eastern Nicaragua in ``practically a coup'' against President
Violeta Chamorro's government.
   Gen. Humberto Ortega said the army and police were awaiting Mrs.
Chamorro's go-ahead to free the strategic Rama road, the sole
overland connection between a large chunk of eastern Nicaragua and
the rest of the country.
   For the past week rebels have blocked the east-west road between
Juigalpa, about 85 miles southeast of Managua, to Rama, another 90
miles east. A reporter who checked three of the 14 roadblocks on
Tuesday saw no one armed, but Ortega said he had reports of weapons
trafficking on the road.
   The rebels also control Bluefields, an Atlantic Coast town 35
miles east of Rama, said AP photographer Ruben Farina, who visited
the city of about 35,000. He said there was no fighting there.
   Mrs. Chamorro called for a meeting in Managua with 14 mayors
from southeastern Nicaraguan who support the blockade. The mayors
are all members of the coalition that elected her last February,
ending the 10-year Sandinista government.
   The mayors and the demobilized rebels claim Mrs. Chamorro has
not fulfilled promises of aid and has left the Sandinistas with too
much power. They are demanding the firing of Defense Minister
Ortega; Antonio Laayo, the presidential chief of staff; Interior
Minister Carlos Hurtado; and the chiefs of the Sandinista Police
and Sandinista People's Army.
   The Sandinistas still control security forces under an accord
reached with Mrs. Chamorro after the Feb. 25 elections, although
Ortega officially resigned from the Sandinista party as part of the
agreements. Conservatives dislike Lacayo because they claim he has
negotiated away too much power to the Sandinistas.
   Ortega urged the rebels to abandon their blockade and said he
hoped force would not have to be used.
   ``Those who have been provoking the climate of ... boycotts,
chaos ... are not political parties or labor unions, but mayors ...
with demands of a change of government, practically a coup
d'etat,'' he said at a news conference.
   Monsignor Pablo Antonio Vega, the conservative bishop of
Juigalpa and a supporter of the blockade, said the 14 mayors were
considering whether to heed the president's call for talks.
   Southeastern Nicaragua was an area of support for the Contra
rebels during their war against the leftist Sandinista government.
   The current blockade has isolated a rich agricultural region and
is causing heavy losses for ranchers and farmers.
   Ortega also announced the retirement of 5,000 officers from the
armed forces by the first of the year. He said that would shrink
Nicaragua's armed forces to 28,000 members, making it the fourth
largest in Central America. It once was the largest in the region,
with about 100,000 people under arms.
   Central American governments have agreed to reduce their armies,
which eat up scarce resources, are frequently accused of committing
rights abuses and tend to be unaccountable to the civilian
governments they are supposed to defend.

   The Food and Drug Administration urged
consumers Thursday to stop taking an illegally marketed and
possibly dangerous drug used for strength training and body
building.
   The FDA said it has received reports of more than 30 people in
California, Florida and Georgia who have become ill after taking a
drug called GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyric acid.
   The drug is also called sodium oxybate and gamma hydroxybutyrate
sodium.
   The agency said GHB can cause nausea and vomiting, severe
respiratory problems, seizures and coma.
   California officials acted earlier in the week, urging consumers
in that state to stop using the drug.
   GHB is sold as powder or granules through mail order outlets,
health food stores, body-building gyms and fitness centers. It is
promoted for strength training, body building, weight loss and as a
replacement for L-tryptophan.
   L-tryptophan, a food supplement used as a sleep aid and for
depression and weight control, was ordered off the market last
March when it was linked to an outbreak of a rare blood disorder
called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
   GHB is being evaluated in approved clinical trials as a
treatment for narcolepsy, a sleep disorder. In Europe GHB has been
used as an adjunct to anesthesia, the agency said.
   It is not approved for any uses in the United States, but the
drug agency said GHB has been promoted as a ``legal psychedelic.''
   The agency advised anyone taking GHB outside of the clinical
trials, which are supervised by physicians, to stop taking it
immediately.
   The agency also said that anyone taking GHB who is having
seizures, uncontrolled shaking, headache, unexplained drowsiness or
other central nervous system disorders, nausea, vomiting or
diarrhea, should see a physician immediately.
   Physicians treating patients with these symptoms were asked to
report the cases to their local poison control center.
   The FDA said it has been working with health departments in the
three states to learn more about the illnesses and so far there is
strong evidence linking these to the drug.

<HEAD>Harry Reasoner to Cut Back ``60 Minutes'' Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   NEW YORK (AP - Harry Reasoner said Thursday he's leaving ``60
Minutes'' as a regular correspondent at the end of the season but
will stay with the CBS show.
   ``It's been a nice ride, but you can't go on forever,'' said the
67-year-old Reasoner.
   He joined CBS in 1956, went to work on ``60 Minutes'' when it
began in 1968, but left the network in 1970 to anchor the ``ABC
Evening News,'' at one point co-anchoring that show - unhappily -
with Barbara Walters.
   Reasoner returned to CBS and ``60 Minutes'' in 1978.
   Next season, he will be an ``editor emeritus'' of the top-rated
newsmagazine and do occasional reports for the program. He
estimated he would do six a year, compared with 20 he now does
annually.
   ``I could say he'll be missed, but he won't be,'' the show's
creator and executive producer, Don Hewitt, said in a playful
statement. ``He'll be right here, looking over my shoulder and
keeping us on the straight and narrow.''
   No correspondent will succeed Reasoner, said a spokeswoman for
the show, whose other regulars include Morley Safer, Ed Bradley,
humorist Andy Rooney, and two who joined the show this season,
Meredith Vieria and Steve Kroft.
   At 72, Mike Wallace is the show's most senior citizen. Several
months ago, he said he won't leave ``60 Minutes'' until he dies, or
goes ``toes up,'' as he jokingly put it.
   The wry, folksy Reasoner, who began his journalism career as a
Minneapolis newspaperman, said he was cutting back his workload at
his own request.
   ``It was cumulative,'' he said of the decision. ``I suddenly
realized I'd been working 53 years, about half of it on `60
Minutes,' and I thought I'd like to take it a little easier.''
   Reasoner, who has won several Emmy awards and a Peabody award
for his broadcast work, said that ``CBS has been extremely nice and
cooperative, and we'll work something out for next season.''
   He also said he never thought that ``60 Minutes,'' begun as a
Tuesday night show in September 1968, ``had a chance for success.
It's been a continual amazement, a show we're very proud of.''

<HEAD>Pope Tells Germany to Keep Abortion Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II, defending strong
anti-abortion laws, on Thursday warned Germany against sacrificing
``Western'' values during the reconstruction of their nation.
   Speaking at a ceremony to accept credentials of Germany's new
ambassador to the Holy See, the pope spoke of the challenge of
emphasizing moral and social values following the unification of
East and West Germany.
   The status of abortion has emerged as a major issue in
reunification. East Germany's Communist regime allowed abortion
virtually on demand, while West German legislation was more
restrictive. It required that a woman prove the pregnancy would
harm her health or cause financial hardship.
   German politicians have decided to let their next parliament,
which will be elected in December, decide the issue.
   ``The reconstruction in a part of Germany and in central and
Eastern Europe currently requires the concurrence of many forces,''
the pope noted.
   ``Nonetheless, that doesn't impede the continued vigilance of
social structures and the resolute commitment to maintain
fundamental values of society that belong to all the West. The
safeguarding of life, both of the born and unborn, is a great good
that must not be sacrificed.''
   The comments marked the second time that the pope has expressed
concern about abortion in a public speech aimed at Germans. In
June, he told Rome's German-speaking community that abortion
debases humanity.
   The new ambassador, 60-year-old Hans-Joachim Hallier, has been
serving as ambassador to Japan.

   Israeli soldiers battled with five guerrillas
who infiltrated from Jordan, and one fighter from each side was
killed, the army said. The other four infiltrators were arrested,
it said.
   A high-ranking Israeli officer speculated the infiltrators may
have intended a revenge attack for the Oct. 8 riots and shootings
by Israeli police that left 20 Palestinians dead at the Temple
Mount. The bloodbath set off a chain of reprisals by Arabs and
Israelis.
   The occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip were shut down Thursday by
a general strike to mark one month since the killings. Another
strike was scheduled Friday, the start of the 36th month of the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
   Jerusalem police detained seven followers of slain Rabbi Meir
Kahane on suspicion of incitement, after they vowed to avenge his
death.
   ``Police will not sit idly in view of inciting calls that lead
to disturbances of order,'' said Jerusalem Police Commissioner
Yaacov Terner.
   One of those detained, Yekutiel Ben Yaakov, said in his eulogy
at Kahane's funeral Wednesday that Kahane's men would ``let our
friend, the submachine gun, our friend the knife, talk for us.''
   The extremist rabbi, who advocated expelling Palestinians from
Israeli and the occupied territories, was assassinated in New York
on Monday by an Arab-American.
   The infiltration from Jordan occurred before dawn Thursday along
the Jordan River just north of Jericho in the West Bank, the army
said.
   It said soldiers found evidence of an infiltration by the
Jordanians and began a search. The guerrillas opened fire with
pistols and the army returned fire, the army said.
   Two of the captured infiltrators were wounded, it said.
   Reserve Capt. Yehuda Lifshitz, who commanded the army force, was
killed in the fighting.
   Israel Television said the guerrilla squad planned to reach
Jerusalem, pray on the sacred Temple Mount, and then slaughter Jews
near the adjacent Western or Wailing Wall, Judaism's holiest site.
Last month's rioting began there when Arabs threw stones at praying
Jews.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, chief of Israel's Central Command,
told Israel radio the infiltrators had ``links to the Jordanian
security establishment.'' An unidentified Jordanian official later
told the state-run Petra News Agency in Amman that four policemen
were missing from their posts.
   It was at least the eighth infiltration or attempted
infiltration linked to Jordanian security in the past two years.
   Also Thursday, an Israeli Druse guard was stabbed to death in
Jenin prison in the occupied West Bank, a military source said. The
victim was attacked by a Palestinian visiting an inmate.
   The attacker fled and remained at large, the television said.
   The death raised to 52 the number of Israelis killed in the
Palestinian uprising.
   A total of 773 Palestinians have been slain by Israeli soldiers
or civilians. An additional 295 Palestinians have been killed by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of collaboration with Israel.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded a
Palestinian man who tried to stab a soldier checking identification
cards at a roadblock, Israel radio said. The soldier wasn't hurt
because he was wearing a flak jacket, it said.

<TEXT>
   William J. Bennett bade farewell as
drug-policy director with characteristic bluster Thursday, boasting
Americans have turned against drugs and dismissing a congressional
critic as a ``gasbag.''
   He allowed that his efforts to rid the nation's capital of drugs
didn't work, but said it did not help that Mayor Marion Barry, who
has been convicted of cocaine possession, was ``part of the
problem.''
   Bennett, at a White House send-off with President Bush, denied
reports that he had run out of gas or feared for his family's
safety as the first director of drug policy.
   ``I'm not the stampeded-out-of-town type,'' said Bennett, who
will actually relinquish his post at the end of the month. Bush
said he has not yet settled on a successor.
   The president showered Bennett with praise, saying he had done
``an outstanding job for his country'' and ``his hard work has paid
off.''
   ``We're on the road to victory,'' said Bush, who promised to
stay ``on the front lines until this scourge is stopped.''
   The brash Bennett, 47, predicted that the Bush goal of cutting
drug usage in half within 10 years now can be met in five years if
states do their part.
   ``Your taking this issue on, your saying in that inaugural
address that `this scourge will stop,' coincided with the great
American change of minds about drugs,'' Bennett said to Bush at a
news conference.
   ``This country is beginning to break its interest and habit on
drugs,'' he said.
   The Brooklyn-born Bennett took umbrage with a parting shot fired
at him earlier by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   Rangel called Bennett's 19-month tenure ``a colossal failure,''
saying he used the job as ``a bull pulpit (sic), running around the
country preaching that families should stay together, that we
shouldn't use drugs.''
   ``I never thought I would miss Nancy Reagan,'' said Rangel.
   Rejoined Bennett: ``Mr. Rangel is a gas bag. He has nothing to
do with drug policy.''
   Bennett said he purposely left Mayor Barry out of the planning
when mapping an anti-drug strategy for the district. He had no hard
evidence then that Barry was using drugs, said Bennett, ``but I
suspected that his interest in the topic was different from mine.''
   Barry issued a statement saying Bennett ``has joined the parade
of people who are using me as an excuse for our nation's failure to
deal adequately'' with the drug problem.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, praised Bennett as ``an outstanding leader'' who proved
``a job which many thought un-doable could be performed with
impressive intellect and success.''
   Bennett, secretary of education in the Reagan administration,
denied that his lack of Cabinet status under Bush impeded his
effectiveness.
   ``I spent more time with this president in 20 months than I
spent with Ronald Reagan in three years. ... three times as much,''
he said.
   Bennett presided over dramatic growth in the federal anti-drug
budget, from $6.3 billion in fiscal 1989 to $10.4 billion for
fiscal 1991.
   Bennett plans to become a fellow at a conservative think tank,
the American Enterprise Institute, and write books on both
education and drugs.
   He is also certain to resume the lucrative lecture circuit
career that earned him $240,000 in just 24 appearances during the
four months between quitting Reagan's Cabinet in 1988 and accepting
Bush's job offer.
   He also received a $187,000 advance on a contract for two books
then.
   ``I've had nine years in government. I think that's enough for
now,'' said Bennett, who also served as chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities in the early 1980s. But to his
critics, he added, ``I may be back.''
   Bennett ruled out a return to academia. In the past he has
accused Harvard and other universities of failing to impart moral
values.
   ``I am free of that world now,'' he said. ``Does the Soviet
dissident wish to return as the head of the gulag?''

<TEXT>
   Mayor David N. Dinkins announced $288 million in
cutbacks Thursday, including a reduction of 5,500 city jobs this
fiscal year - and perhaps 20,000 next year - through layoffs and
attrition.
   The cuts, combined with the $100 million sale of a parking lot,
will make up a $388 million budget shortfall for the fiscal year
that ends June 30.
   ``Today, I have some bad news and some worse news,'' Dinkins
told reporters.
   The bad news, he said, ``requires painful sacrifices from every
part of our administration,'' including a 10 percent cut of mayoral
staff.
   The worse news was that on Jan. 15 he'll be back with another
proposal for the fiscal year beginning in July to close a budget
gap that has grown to $1.6 billion.
   Already this year, the mayor has closed a gap of $1.8 billion in
the fiscal year that began in July through budget cuts, ordered a
hiring freeze and cut pay of top management by 5 percent, including
lopping $6,500 off his own salary of $130,000.
   The city faces the cuts because of falling tax revenues. ``The
root of all these problems is the economy,'' said budget director
Philip Michael. Last month, Standard and Poor's, a major bond
rating service, put the city on ``credit watch.''
   New York is not alone. A plan to save Philadelphia from
bankruptcy is expected to be released Friday.
   Under the proposal for this fiscal year, New York City's Board
of Education would be forced to cut $90 million. Health and human
services agencies would be cut $51.9 million. The uniformed
services - police and firefighters - would be reduced by $60.6
million and all others $85.5 million.
   The city also increased its reserve fund for emergencies by $50
million, to $150 million. This was done because of the possibility
of possible economic worsening, officials said.
   The Board of Education faces 550 layoffs and 1,000 people lost
by attrition. The board can make the cuts as it sees fit. But the
city suggested that teacher layoffs and attrition include 117
teachers who teach teachers; 357 non-instructional personnel; and
1,072 positions that will not be filled as they become vacant.
   Notices to city workers won't go out until the spring.
   The mayor said other cuts include wading pools in parks,
delaying recycling, postponing hiring additional teachers, and
eliminating three fire companies and two fire salvage units.
Hundreds of employees also will be lost from the city's housing
rehabilitation program.
   The city also must recoup anticipated losses seen in fiscal year
1992, which begins in July. The 20,000 jobs that may be lost would
come roughly half from attrition, half from layoffs, the budget
director said.
   ``These are projections that could have a great deal of range to
them,'' Michael said. ``Quite frankly, there's a lot of contingency
that has to be played out.''
   As the mayor made his announcement, about 800 members of Local
1180 of the Communications Workers of America demonstrated in City
Hall Park, then walked to Wall Street.
   ``We're getting more of the same crap - job freezes, layoffs,
wage freezes,'' said Local 1180's president, Arthur Cheliotes, who
represents administrative personnel in the city.
   Leaders of municipal unions have broken off contract talks with
the city because city has been unwilling to match a 5.5 percent pay
raise teachers received Oct. 1. The city budgeted 1.5 percent
increases for all unions and says that is all it is giving the
teachers - the rest comes from state aid and a rearrangement of the
pension funding system.

<TEXT>
   A Security Council committee on Thursday
approved U.N. inspectors for Jordan's border with Iraq to make sure
trucks are not taking goods to Iraq and occupied Kuwait in
violation of the U.N. economic embargo.
   Suspicion that Jordan is not enforcing the embargo focuses on
highway traffic from Jordan's port of Aqaba to Baghdad, Iraq's
capital.
   Deputy Finnish Ambassador Marjatta Rasi, who presides over the
Security Council's committee on sanctions against Iraq, said the
committee asked U.N. staff in Jordan to begin spot-checking trucks
at the border.
   Jordanian Ambassador Abdullah Salah requested the observers last
week, to prove Jordan is obeying the embargo.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Jordan became aware it will receive no special economic aid from
the world community unless other countries are sure it is observing
the embargo.
   Unless Jordan completely obeys the embargo, approved in
Resolution 661 on Aug. 6, it does not qualify for special relief
aid, the diplomats said.
   Jordan applied for help under the U.N. Charter, which provides
for countries burdened with ``special economic problems arising
from the carrying out'' of sanctions or other Security Council
actions.
   Ms. Rasi said she was sending a letter to Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar informing him of the committee's decision.
   A. Attiga, resident coordinator of the U.N. Disaster Relief
Organization based in Amman, will be in charge of the effort, using
his staff, she said.
   The Sanctions Committee decided not to send in outside observers
to keep the cost down, Ms. Rasi said.
   Americans based in the U.S. Embassy in Amman had been monitoring
border traffic, but were pulled back to the capital for their own
safety, U.S. officials at the United Nations said last week.
   Jean Ripert, the U.N. chief's special envoy, said after
returning from Amman that Jordan's economy will collapse next year
unless Jordan gets help from other countries.
   He said Jordan will lose about $1 billion between Aug. 2, when
Iraq invaded Kuwait, and the end of this year because of the trade
embargo on Baghdad, its major trading partner.
   In terms of the proportion of Jordan's gross national product
lost due to the embargo, he said, the picture is far worse.
   ``For Jordan, in 1990 it is a figure around 30 percent. For next
year, it could be something above 50 percent,'' he said.
   `` ... The question is, will Jordan be able to survive?''
   In other U.N. developments Thursday:
   -Emerging democracies in Eastern Europe said they are ready to
renounce a 15-year-old resolution equating Zionism with racism, but
Israel and the United States don't want to press the point until
they are sure of overwhelming support.
   U.N. envoys from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Bulgaria -
among 72 U.N. members who agreed in a Nov. 10, 1975, vote that the
founding ideology of Israel was racist - revealed a change of heart
at a conference convened by American Jewish leaders.
   -Perez de Cuellar reported to the Security Council that his
latest efforts to end the Cyprus stalement failed and a ``negative
atmosphere ... has persisted.'' But he said he would keep trying to
bring Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides together and appealed to them
to cooperate to avoid aggravating the situation. Turkey invaded and
occupied northern Cyprus in 1974 to protect the Turkish minority
from what it called persecution and violence.

<HEAD>Italian President Called to Testify About Government Guerrillas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge notified President Francesco Cossiga on
Thursday that he would be called to testify about a secret,
government-organized guerrilla group that was created in the 1950s.
   It was the first time in Italy's postwar history that a
president had been called as a witness in a case, Italian media
reported.
   Italy's No. 2 party, the opposition Communists, called for the
resignation of Premier Giulio Andreotti, who has been under siege
since admitting last month that the group existed.
   Politicians have speculated that the group, ostensibly created
to fight any Soviet Bloc invasion, had trained its sights on
domestic targets - namely, the Communists. There has been
speculation the group was behind some right-wing terrorist attacks
that plagued Italy in the 1970s and '80s, when the Communists came
to the brink of power.
   Andreotti told the Senate that 622 Italians belonged to the
network, codenamed Operation Gladio after the short, double-edged
sword used by Roman gladiators.
   Italians were recruited during the Cold War on the basis of
their patriotism and physical fitness, he said. Members of the
network were civilians, apparently with military backgrounds.
   The Christian Democratic premier said that the Defense Ministry
knew about the group, which was trained by the Italian secret
services.
   ``No one can doubt that any distorted use of the structure would
happen only outside the directives of the ministries,'' he said
Thursday.
   He added that a check by Italian police had shown that none of
the ``gladiators'' had had judicial records ``or other indications
going against democratic security.''
   Andreotti said that in 1959, France requested Italy be allowed
to join a special NATO group that coordinated similar guerrilla
groups in other member countries. NATO spokesmen have refused to
comment on Gladio.
   The leader of the Communist group in the Senate, Ugo Pecchioli,
demanded Andreotti's resignation.
   ``This government has brought upon itself heavy responsibilities
and it doesn't have the credit nor the capacity to deal with such a
profound crisis,'' Pecchioli said.
   His cry was not echoed by any of the five parties of the
governing coalition, who hold the majority in the Senate. They are
Andreotti's Christian Democrats, the Socialists, Republicans,
Liberals and Social Democrats.
   ``We ask that this all be fully investigated so that there are
no dark corners, ambiguities, uncertainties or unresolved
mysteries,'' said the Socialist leader in the Senate, Fabio Fabbri.
   The case has been taken up by Venice Investigating Magistrate
Felice Casson, a specialist in terrorism. Casson discovered the
existence of the Gladio organization during a probe of a right-wing
terrorist attack.
   On Thursday, Casson sent word to Cossiga that he would be called
to testify in the new case. Cossiga, a former premier and interior
minister, recently revealed he had known of the Gladio organization
for years.

   Marchand left Thursday for Monday's ceremony, Fujimori said

   Fujimori, the son of Japanese parents, visited Japan in June
shortly after being elected, to secure fresh loans and emergency
donations to help ease Peru's economic crisis.
   Fujimori, who speaks fluent Japanese, visited his parents'

   Marchand is to hold talks on Japanese investment in Peru with
Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
   Japan is Peru's second-largest trading partner after the United
States.

   Left-wing guerrillas have bombed U.S.-linked
agencies and Lima's largest synagogue in a wave of attacks
protesting American and Israeli policies in the Mideast. No one has
been seriously injured in the attacks.
   A bomb Wednesday night caused minor damage near the U.S.
ambassador's residence, police said, and another bomb at the North
American Cultural Institute slightly injured a bystander. Bombs
last weekend caused minor damage at the U.S. Consulate; a branch
office of Xerox Corp.; and the Peruvian Israelite Union Synagogue.
   A weekly newspaper close to the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement said Thursday the attacks ``target Jews and Americans
engaged in the violation of human and national rights in the Middle
East.''
   The Jewish community in Peru is quite small, including 3,000 in
Lima, the country's capital and largest city. About 70 percent
belong to the Israelite Union congregation.
   Tupac Amaru is the smaller of two guerrilla groups operating in
Peru. Like the larger Shining Path, Tupac Amaru is
Marxist-Leninist. But the pro-Cuba group mainly has attacked U.S.
influence in Peru; Shining Path would like to recreate Peru along
the lines of the Chinese Communist revolution.
   Clashes between the army and the Shining Path left 11 dead
Wednesday in a coca-producing jungle area, military sources said.
Slain were an army captain, four soldiers and six rebels, the
sources said, speaking on condition they not be named.
   The battles took place about six miles south of Tingo Maria, the
main city in the Upper Huallaga Valley, about 200 miles northeast
of Lima.
   Drug traffickers in the area supply rebels with guns and money
in return for protection. The region provides over 60 percent of
the world's supply of coca leaf. The leaf is ground into paste and
flown to Colombia, where it is processed into cocaine.
   Political violence the past 10 years has claimed the lives of
more than 20,000 Peruvians, mostly civilians.
   An international organization of journalists met Thursday with
Defense Ministry officials and congressmen to denounce the murder
and harassment of dozens of Peruvian reporters.
   The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists
delivered a report to Defense Ministry officials Thursday that said
15 journalists have been killed while doing their job the last
three years.
   In the same period, two journalists disappeared, 17 were beaten
and many others were threatened, the federation said.
   Soldiers and police are suspected in at least eight of the
killings and guerrillas are suspected in at least six. There are no
clear suspects in the other slaying, the federation's report said.
   Todd Smith, a reporter for the Tampa Tribune, is the only
foreign journalist named in the federation's report. Smith was
killed in November 1989 in Uchiza, in the Upper Huallaga Valley.
Drug traffickers, guerrillas and police have all been mentioned as
suspects in his death.

<HEAD>Cast of ``Cheers'' And Boston Celebrate 200th Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The cast of the television show ``Cheers''
celebrated the show's 200th episode Thursday night, thanking
Bostonians for the good humor that made the series famous.
   The program was broadcast in its usual NBC time slot but ran for
an hour rather than a half-hour.
   ``This is overwhelming,'' said George Wendt, who plays Norm
Peterson, the roly-poly beer-swigging barfly on the show.
   Wendt received a roar from the crowd and chants of ``Norm,
Norm'' at his introduction at a City Hall celebration earlier in
the day. The cast traveled downtown in a motorcade.
   ``Sorry we screwed up your lunch hour,'' Wendt told several
thousand people who stood in 45 degree temperatures.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn, who was out of town on vacation, officially
named Thursday ``Cheers Appreciation Day.''
   The entire staff turned out for the celebration, except for
Woody Harrelson, who portrays the slow-witted bartender of the same
name.
   ``Cheers,'' a sitcom about regular patrons at a bar of the same
name, is based on Bull &amp; Finch, a Boston basement-level bar. The
show is in its 9th season and has included cameo appearances by
Flynn and Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   The sitcom is filmed in Los Angeles and the movie company flew
the cast to Boston for the sake of image. The crowd that lined
downtown streets to watch the actors' motorcade treated the cast as
their own.
   City and sports officials presented the actors with small gifts
reflecting their television characters. Kelsey Grammer, who plays
Dr. Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist who graduated from Harvard, was
presented with a sweatshirt from the university band for
``perpetuating the stereotypes about Harvard.''
   ``I know why Frasier makes so much money in this town. The
entire city is suffering from a mass psychosis,'' Grammer said.
   ``Cheers'' was No. 1 for its time slot last year and has won 22
Emmys since its first airing.
   The show's success has enabled some cast members to launch movie
careers. Ted Danson, the suave womanizer Sam ``MayDay'' Malone on
the show, appeared in ``Three Men And A Baby,'' and Kirstie Alley,
who portrays self-conscious ``Cheers'' manager Rebecca Howe, is
starring in her second motion picture, ``Sibling Rivalry.''

   A U.S. campaign to gain support for U.N. military action against
Iraq got a boost Thursday, with the Soviet Union offering its
qualified approval. President Bush, as expected, ordered a new
round of troop deployments, adding up to 150,000 soldiers to the
multinational force facing off against Iraq.
   In another development, Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein sacked
his army chief, suggesting dissension in the ranks over Kuwait,
which his forces overran three months ago.
   The deployment of as many as 150,000 troops represents a
substantial addition to the 230,000 U.S. military personnel in the
region. Allies from 26 countries have sent 70,000 soldiers to the
multinational force assembled in the area.
   ``If this movement of force is what convinces him (Saddam), so
much the better,'' Bush said in a nationwide broadcast from
Washington. ``Let's hope he comes to his senses.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, giving details of the new
buildup, said it would include two armored divisions and small
armored units from Germany as well as the famed ``Big Red One''
First Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Riley, Kans.
   Pentagon officials in private conversations said full deployment
of the units would total about 150,000 troops.
   Said Bush, ``We're talking about significant numbers'' of
troops. Cheney, who faced reporters after Bush, added, ``We will
not put an upper limit on this deployment.''
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said,
``Whether it will be adequate in the event of going to war with
Saddam Hussein's army, I'm not going to speculate.''
   ``Iraq's brutality, aggression and violation of international
law cannot be permitted to succeed,'' Bush said, referring to the
``dismantling of Kuwait'' by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``I find it hard to believe that today, November 8, that he
(Saddam) does not understand that he's up against a determined,
unprecedented alliance ...''
   ``When he surveys the force that's there ... he will recognize
that he is up against just a foe that he can't possible manage
militarily,' Bush said.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, meanwhile, secured
the release of 50 more Westerners from Iraq, including Germans,
Italians, Dutch and Britons, the Iraqi News Agency reported. It did
not say when they would be freed. Iraq on Wednesday promised to
free more than 100 Westerners.
   Hundreds of Americans are among those still trapped, some held
at strategic sites to deter attack by the U.S.-led mutinational
force in the region.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in Moscow with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Baker wants Moscow to agree to
using force as a last resort to liberate Kuwait.
   Later, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said
military might should not be ruled out, but cautioned it should be
used only under U.N. auspices.
   ``A situation may emerge which effectively would require such a
move,'' Shevardnadze said.
   He played down any differences on Iraq between the superpowers.
Before Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait, Moscow was Baghdad's principal
ally and principal weapons supplier.
   ``I would advise against looking for some difference in the
positions between the Soviet Union and the United States,''
Shevardnadze told reporters.
   Bush said ``we're on the same wavelength'' with Gorbachev in
terms of his policy goals in the Middle East. He said he felt there
were no ``mixed signals'' from Moscow.
   The Bush administration, impatient that months of economic
sanctions have failed to dislodge Saddam from Kuwait, intends to
ask the U.N. Security Council to authorize force to liberate Kuwait
if Iraq doesn't pull out.
   Baker is on a weeklong tour of Middle Eastern and European
nations to gather support for such action. He travels to Paris and
London before heading back to Washington on Saturday.
   If such a measure were adopted, it would be the first time the
U.N. authorized a joint military command. During the Korean War, it
authorized the United States to command the U.N. forces repelling
North Korea's invasion.
   The United States and its allies are facing about 430,000 Iraqi
troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   There seemed to be indications Thursday that cracks might be
opening in Iraq's stated determination to remain in Kuwait.
   Iraq's army newspaper and U.S. officials said Saddam replaced
his military chief of staff, Gen. Nizar Al-Khazraji, with the head
of his elite Republican Guards, Gen. Hussein Rashid. It did not say
when or why Khazraji was dismissed.
   Western analysts with knowledge of Iraq's military machine said
Khazraji's surprise dismissal indicated growing opposition in some
military quarters to Saddam's strategy on Kuwait.
   ``It's very ominous,'' said Hans-Heino Kopietz, with Control
Risks, an international security firm in London.
   ``It's not wise to change horses in mid-stream at this point in
time. Khazraji's dismissal now is indicative of some opposition to
Saddam within the military,'' said Kopietz, just back from a Middle
East tour.
   Khazraji had been chief of staff since 1985 and was one of the
top officers in Saddam's inner circle of military advisers.
   He was sacked amid increasingly tough U.S. and British warnings
that they might use force to dislodge Iraq from Kuwait if
necessary.
   Saddam regularly purges those he perceives as a threat. It was
the second replacement of a high-level Iraqi official in two weeks.
Oil Minister Issam Chalabi was fired Oct. 28 and replaced by Brig.
Gen. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's cousin and son-in-law.
   Some analysts said Rashid's appointment was in part designed to
keep the Republican Guards on Saddam's side. The guards are
considered Saddam's best troops among his million-man forces.
   In Amman, Jordan, 11 British women arrived Thursday en route to
Baghdad to seek the release of their husbands and relatives held
hostage after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. They were expected to
leave Friday for Iraq.
   And in Warsaw, Poland, 241 Poles returned from Iraq on Thursday
and one told Polish TV at the airport that about 40 Americans being
held at a chemical plant were in ``tragic'' condition.
   Iraq offered to allow relatives of foreigners banned from
leaving to spend Christmas with loved ones. The British and U.S.
governments discouraged relatives from accepting the invitation.
   The women hope to negotiate directly with Saddam and ask him to
release the men on humanitarian grounds.

<HEAD>Texas Education Officials Escalate Battle Over Evolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT ROTHSCHILD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas education officials gave preliminary
approval Thursday to science textbooks that teach evolution, but a
longtime clash with creationists continued.
   The State Board of Education asked its staff to look into
whether a reference in some of the books, which says human embryos
have gill slits, was accurate.
   The board, meeting as a committee, tentatively approved the
biology books, striking a blow to religious fundamentalists who say
the texts don't treat creationism as an equally valid idea.
   A final vote was set for Saturday.
   Texas is one of the nation's largest textbook buying states and
influences what publishers put in textbooks. The textbooks under
consideration are for grades 1 through 12.
   ``This is a major victory,'' said Mike Hudson, general counsel
for the People for the American Way, a civil rights group that has
lobbied for expanded coverage of evolution in science textbooks.
   ``This is probably the most important thing that has happened in
science education in the past five years,'' Hudson said of the
board's preliminary vote.
   Mel Gabler, who with his wife, Norma, has fought against
evolution for about 30 years, said the proposed texts were a form
of censorship. Gabler argued they treat evolution as a fact without
including debate of the theory.
   ``Why are evolutionists so afraid of giving students weaknesses
as well as strengths of evolution,?'' Gabler asked. ``Censorship
nullifies critical thinking of students. This is indoctrination,
not education,'' he said.
   The theory of evolution holds that all species of plants and
animals developed from earlier forms, through hereditary
transmission of slight variations in successive generations.
Creationism ascribes the origin of species to acts of God as
described in the Bible.
   Education Board member Will Davis of Austin said the books
``separate religious theory from scientific theory.''
   ``In public school textbooks, we are not to engage in religious
theory. That's for churches, that's for your own soul-searching. In
public schools we deal with science, not religion,'' he said.
   Davis said the current science textbooks give a cursory review
of evolution, while the new books are much more in depth.
   Each side presented its own scientists to testify.
   Claud Bramblett, a University of Texas scientist, said the
textbooks were well-written and would probably interest more
students in science.
   ``We need to grow future scientists, not import them,'' he said.
   Walter Bradley, a Texas A&amp;M University scientist, said the books
contained errors and were written in a way that students would just
accept the teachings as fact.
   Education Board Chairman Monte Hasie of Lubbock said the books
weren't perfect, but better than the current ones.
   ``I think we're making progress and that's what education is all
about,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   One of the nation's most successful
personal-injury attorneys and two other lawyers reaped millions of
dollars by manufacturing evidence, bribing witnesses and creating
phony cases, a prosecutor said Thursday.
   ``These defendants decided that winning personal-injury lawsuits
was the most important thing, the only thing, and they were willing
to do whatever it took to win,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerome C.
Roth told jurors, opening a complicated trial that is expected to
last several months.
   Morris J. Eisen, two of his top lawyers and several aides and
investigators at Eisen's Manhattan law firm are accused of a
wide-ranging scheme of racketeering, mail fraud, falsification of
evidence and bribery of witnesses, law enforcers and court workers
dating back nearly a decade.
   James La Rossa, Eisen's lawyer, argued his client was the object
of a vendetta orchestrated by insurance companies and city and
state governments who have had to pay millions of dollars in awards
to injured people represented by Eisen's firm.
   ``You're going to hear a lot of things that are going to
disappoint you as Americans,'' La Rossa told the jury.
   He defended Eisen and other personal-injury lawyers, who work on
a contingency fee basis and are paid only when they win or settle
lawsuits. La Rossa said such lawyers are defenders of poor and
disadvantaged people who would not be able to otherwise afford
attorneys.
   Eisen and the other two lawyers, Joseph P. Napoli and Harold M.
Fishman, are on trial before U.S. District Judge Charles P. Sifton.
Also on trial are several private investigators and the firm's
former office manager.
   The defendants are accused of violating the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, and other
crimes. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison and fines
of as much as double the proceeds of their alleged criminal
activity, prosecutors said.
   An investigation involving 19 personal-injury lawsuits - seven
of them against the city - began in 1985. Awards in those lawsuits
amounted to as much as $9 million and the firm's contingency fees
were about one-third of that amount, prosecutors said.
   The victims of the alleged frauds, which date to at least 1981,
included city and state governments, the Transit Authority, private
corporations, individuals and insurance companies, Roth said.
   He said the defendants manufactured evidence, such as digging
potholes where there were none, paid people to falsely say they had
witnessed accidents, paid eyewitnesses to lie or not to testify and
fabricated accidents when none occurred.
   The defendants were ``limited only by their own imagination,''
Roth said.
   La Rossa told jurors the real wrongdoers were the liars and con
artists the government had granted immunity and would present as
credible witnesses.
   Those witnesses made a deal to testify for the prosecution, he
said.

<TEXT>
   A man was convicted Thursday of sexually
assaulting a woman who doctors say has 46 personalities after he
testified she consented to sex and he learned only later she was
mentally ill.
   ``I still don't think she is mentally ill,'' the defendant, Mark
A. Peterson, said after the verdict was announced. ``What's there
to be sorry about? Why should I be sorry for her?''
   Peterson was convicted of second-degree sexual assault and could
be sentenced to 10 years in prison. He remained free on $5,000
bond. Sentencing was scheduled for Dec. 10 and he said he will
appeal.
   Jurors heard psychiatrists disagree over the 27-year-old woman's
contention that she was unaware one of her personalities -
described as a fun-loving 20-year-old woman - was having sex. She
said she learned of it from another personality, a girl the age of
6.
   Earlier Thursday, Peterson contradicted testimony by the woman
and others that he was warned she suffered from multiple
personality disorder.
   He said when he later learned the woman was ill, he telephoned
to apologize but she hung up after warning: ``I'm going to
prosecute you, you bastard.''
   The woman testified Wednesday that Peterson, 29, manipulated the
personality that was prevalent at the time to force her to have
intercourse.
   She blinked her eyes and bowed her head as she summoned six
different personalities to the witness stand. Four of them were
sworn in individually.
   Darold Treffert, a psychiatrist who testified for the defense,
said he feels she comprehended her conduct. Treffert said the
woman's various characters were encouraged by her therapists who
believe in multiple personality disorder, which he called ``the UFO
of psychiatry.''
   Peterson testified: ``She excited me. ... She was pretty. ... I
asked her if I could love her. She said, `Yes.'''
   Under Wisconsin law, it is a crime to have sex with people known
to suffer from a mental illness that makes them incapable of
understanding their conduct.
   District Attorney Joe Paulus argued that the woman is mentally
ill and Peterson knew it when he had sex with her in the front seat
of his car June 11 at an Oshkosh park.
   The defendant wanted to keep one of the woman's personalities,
Jennifer, as his mistress, the prosecutor said during closing
arguments.
   Peterson, who's married, treated the victim ``like a piece of
meat at his disposal to play games with,'' Paulus said. ``Jennifer
is his little secret. She is the person he can call on to have sex.
She is the mental illness he can manipulate.''
   Defense lawyer Ed Salzsieder argued that the evidence showed
Peterson, a former grocery store bagger, was guilty of nothing more
than bad judgment and promiscuity but he did not manipulate a
mentally ill woman.
   Peterson is ``no rocket scientist,'' Salzsieder said.
   The jury was asked to decide three issues: whether the woman was
mentally ill, whether the illness made her incapable of appraising
her conduct and whether Peterson knew of the illness.
   Psychiatrists diagnosed the woman, who earned an associate
degree from college, as having multiple personality disorder last
February, a diagnosis that has only been recognized within the last
decade.
   The disorder is often triggered by childhood abuse that forces
the victim to create separate personalities to avoid confronting
reality. About 7,000 Americans suffer from the illness.
   Peterson testified he asked the woman out for coffee, eventually
drove her to a park and had sex with her.
   The woman told him about people she called John, Jamie and
Jennifer, but Peterson said he thought she was referring to
brothers and sisters at first. He became suspicious that the woman
might have a mental illness when they returned to her home after
leaving the park, he said.
   Peterson said he first heard the term multiple personality
disorder mentioned when he returned to the woman's home and
witnessed the woman switch personalities for the first time.
   ``I was very surprised, yes. I never seen that before. Never
heard of it happening before,'' he told the court.
   Peterson said a statement he gave police indicating he was aware
of the woman's different personalities before he had sex was wrong.
He signed the statement because he was tired, he said.
   Jury foreman David Ward said the statement ``was a key to the
conviction.''

   A judge said Thursday he would sentence
a teen-ager who remains a suspect in the Gainesville student
killings to a psychiatric treatment center for beating his elderly
grandmother.
   Circuit Judge Theron Yawn postponed final sentencing of
19-year-old Edward Lewis Humphrey for a week until lawyers find a
place that will accept him and provide ``a structured environment
to assure that he will not get back on the streets ... until he is
mentally able.''
   The teen-ager is one of eight suspects in the August killings of
five college students near the University of Florida. Investigators
have yet to charge him or eliminate him as a suspect.
   He has been jailed on $1 million bond since Aug. 30 when he was
arrested after beating his grandmother.
   He was convicted Oct. 10 of battery on a person over age 65 and
could have been sentenced to as much as 22 months in prison.
   Noting the intense publicity linking Humphrey to the slayings,
Yawn said: ``I want it thoroughly understood there is no connection
between the events in Gainesville and this case.''

results, tightens pvs. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BRADFORD, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservatives finished third in a special parliamentary election
Thursday in this northern town in a sound thrashing for her
troubled government.
   In another vote, in the northwest England dockland town of
Bootle, the opposition Labor Party got 22,052 votes, compared with
2,587 for the Conservatives and 2,216 for the Liberal Democrats.
   In Bradford North, Tory candidate Joy Atkin came in third with
only 6,048 votes or 16 percent, a 23 percent decline for the
Conservatives since the last general election in 1987. Labor
candidate Terry Rooney won 18,619 votes or 52 percent; Liberal
Democrat David Ward took 9,105 votes for 25 percent. The rest went
to fringe parties.
   Bootle has long been a solid area for Labor, but the
Conservatives were viewed as having a chance to win in North
Bradford. Their poor showing reflected the crisis in the
Conservative Party since Mrs. Thatcher's deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe,
quit last week.
   ``Clearly a disappointing result,'' Conservative Party chairman
Kenneth Baker said of the results in the 67,340-voter district of
Bradford North. ``I think out there we're not very popular at the
moment.''
   The elections were caused by the deaths of the previous
legislators in the two districts.
   The poor Tory showing in Bradford North prompted renewed
speculation that an attempt will be made to oust Mrs. Thatcher as
Conservative leader and prime minister at the party's annual
leadership election this month.
   ``The pressures and feeling there should be a leadership contest
will build up,'' said rank-and-file legislator Tony Marlow. ``I
think there will be a new prime minister before Christmas.'' She
became prime minister in 1979.
   Britain's fledgling Islamic Party finished a poor fourth in its
first run for office in Bradford North, getting 800 votes. The
former textile town has 7,000 Moslem voters, reflecting the large
numbers of Pakistani immigrants who came to work in mills in the
1950s and '60s.
   In both Bradford North and Bootle the voter turnout was low, 53
percent in Bradford North and 39 percent in Bootle.
   In resigning, Howe complained about Mrs. Thatcher's combative
style, but said Thursday he had also resigned over issues of
``substance.'' He was frustrated over Mrs. Thatcher's resistance to
a closer union of the European Community.
   Controversy over a new local government tax imposed last spring
dominated the Bradford campaign. But the sight of Mrs. Thatcher in
trouble nationally added to the Tories' difficulties.
   In national opinion polls, the Conservatives are trailing
between 12 and 20 points behind Labor.
   The results scarcely dented dent Mrs. Thatcher's huge majority -
down from 100 to 98 - in the 650-member House of Commons.
   The Conservatives have 373 seats, Labor 227 and the Liberal
Democrats 20. Two seats are vacant and the remainder are held by
minority regional parties.

<HEAD>Einstein, Freud Letters on War to Be Auctioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theories on war and how to prevent it are a dime
a dozen, but Albert Einstein's and Sigmund Freud's are expected to
bring at least $150,000.
   Sotheby's announced Thursday that two letters on the subject
from two of the greatest minds of the 20th century would be
auctioned Dec. 11.
   The letters were written at the request of the League of Nations
for a book of ``letters between leaders of thought.''
   Einstein's four-page missive, dated July 28, 1932, focuses on
the question, ``Is there a way to liberate man from the doom of
war?''
   He states his support for a world body to resolve all conflicts
between nations and adds that war exists only because ``man has in
him the need to hate and destroy.''
   Freud's 14-page answer, dated Sept. 12, 1932, attributes that
need to man's aggressive instincts. ``In the meantime, we may
assure ourselves: everything that serves to promote cultural

   Both letters are handwritten and signed. They were consigned by

   Eleven British women arrived Thursday en
route to Baghdad to seek the release of their husbands and
relatives held hostage after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. They were
expected to leave Friday for Iraq.
   In Warsaw, Poland, 241 Poles returned from Iraq on Thursday and
one told Polish TV at the airport that the conditions in which
about 40 Americans were being held at a chemical plant were
``tragic.''
   The group of women who flew into Amman on Thursday includes
wives, girlfriends, one fincee and the mothers of two hostages.
   The British Foreign Office advised the women against going and
called the trip ``risky,'' but they ignored the advice, and paid
for the trip themselves.
   ``Our main objective is to seek the freedom of our husbands,''
said Dorothy Goodwin, 55, whose husband, Peter, was a pilot with
Kuwaiti Airways.
   Sunni Jennings said: ``My husband encouraged me to come now
rather than Christmas because the sooner I come, the better.''
   She said she hoped to return home before Christmas with her
husband, Michael, who worked as an engineer for a Kuwaiti company
before the Aug. 2 invasion.
   Iraq offered to allow relatives of foreigners banned from
leaving to spend Christmas with loved ones. The British and U.S.
governments discouraged relatives from accepting the invitation.
   The women hope to negotiate directly with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and ask him to release the men on humanitarian grounds.
   Iraqi authorities granted them one-month visas, and promised to
assist them. But no meetings with Saddam were promised.
   Before leaving London, Carol Cox, 31, said: ``This is not a
joyous occasion. ... But we are certainly going out there as a
solid group with the same aim - to get our husbands and relatives
home.''
   Her husband, John, was a sales manager for a shipping company in
Kuwait and is now believed held at a strategic site in Iraq.
   At least 600 foreigners, mainly Americans, Britons, Germans and
Japanese, are held as human shields at potential military targets
in Iraq and Kuwait. Thousands of others are banned from leaving,
but have not been relocated.
   Speaking to reporters at London's Heathrow Airport, the women
urged Britain, the United States and the allies to exercise
restraint in dealing with Iraq.
   ``We are not politicians or diplomats, we are just ordinary
people,'' Mrs. Goodwin said. ``We are hoping for a peaceful
solution to the crisis rather than a military one.''
   The returning Pole in Warsaw, not identified, said that at the
Iraqi chemical plant where he was working, ``I suspect it produces
military gas - were 40 American citizens ... shut up in the
production hall.
   ``It is tragic, to be frank.''
   He said Poles were being treated in a ``friendly'' way, but a
companion said many were having trouble getting the exit permits
needed to leave Iraq.
   Reports on how many of Poles remained ranged from about 200 to
more than 700.
   In London, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd personally
appealed to Tony Benn of the opposition Labor Party on Thursday to
call off a trip to Baghad. Benn says he will see Saddam in hopes of
preventing war.
   Hurd told the House of Commons, ``If he goes, he is joining in a
game where the aggressor dictates the rules and selected human
beings are the pawns.''
   Benn is a former energy secretary and a leftist often in
conflict with moderates in his own party.
   Labor's foreign affairs spokesman, Gerald Kaufman, said Benn
``represents himself and not his party.''

<HEAD>City Bans Most Cigarette Vending Machines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping to keep cigarettes from children, the
City Council voted Thursday to ban vending machines that offer the
smokes in most public places.
   Taverns would be exempt from the ban, which needs the signature
of Mayor David Dinkins, a former two-pack-a-day smoker, to become
law.
   The ban would eliminate cigarette machines from virtually all
places they are typically found, like restaurants, theaters and
bowling alleys.
   Councilman Sal Albanese said the move makes New York the first
major city in the country to ban cigarette vending machines. Salt
Lake City and Minneapolis have enacted similar bans.
   The primary purpose of the ban is ``to prevent the children from
easy access to cigarettes,'' said Councilman Joseph Lisa, chairman
of the council's health committee and a leading sponsor of the
measure.
   Last month, the Music, Cigarette &amp; Amusement Association, Inc.,
representing over 150 small businesses in the vending machine
industry, told the council the ban would cost 2,000 unskilled and
semi-skilled workers their jobs.
   Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Tobacco
Institute said the ban would only ``punish and inconvenience adults
who are looking to purchase a legal product.''
   ``The tobacco industry agrees with the goal of keeping
cigarettes out of the hands of kids, but it is a misguided notion
to think that by banning cigarette vending machines that's what
you're going to accomplish,'' she said.
   The council voted 33-1 for the ban. The lone dissenter was
Councilman Jerome O'Donovan, who said ``common sense should prevail
since youngsters know smoking is dangerous'' and warned the ban
would be hard to enforce.
   Taverns and bars in hotels or motels would be able to keep
cigarette vending machines as long as they are placed where
employees can prevent underage buyers from using them. State law
bans the sale of cigarettes to those under age 18.
   Violations of the ban, which would take effect Jan. 31, 1992,
would result in maximum fines ranging from $300 for the first
offense to $1,000 for the third. A third or subsequent violation
also would result in suspension of a violator's cigarette licenses
for up to one year.
   Les Zuke, a spokesman for cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris
Inc., called the ban unnecessary and ``an overreaction.''
   Vending machines account for only 3 percent of national
cigarette sales, so the ban would have little effect on cigarette
makers, he said, adding it would only hurt the vending-machine
industry.
   Councilman Stephen DiBrienza said: ``People should realize
cigarettes are no different from bullets. They kill.''

   In an effort to thwart rising crime,
President Carlos Andres Perez announced a nighttime curfew for
minors.
   Those under age 18 caught on the streets after 10 p.m. will be
taken to ``special areas,'' where their parents will be summoned
or, in the case of parentless youths, taken to centers for
abandoned children, Perez said Thursday.
   ``This is another measure to stop an extremely serious (crime)
situation we're facing with minors,'' the president said in a
weekly radio broadcast.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the curfew, which would take
effect immediately, will be enforced by regular police.
   Perez recently set up a special 600-member military National
Guard force to help patrol Caracas.
   Teenagers under age 18 are blamed for as much as 75 percent of
Venezuela's violent crime.
   Citizens have protested against lenient laws that shield teenage
criminals and turn them into pawns of adult gangs; the youths may
not be jailed, and are often freed within days.
   The rate of theft, mugging and murder has steadiy climbed in
this nation of 20 million recent years, as the economy declined.

<TEXT>
   A Montana man's rape conviction and 90-year
prison sentence were reversed Thursday by an appeals court that
ruled spectators wearing large ``Women Against Rape'' buttons hurt
his chances for a fair trial.
   The buttons, worn by three women during the trial of Robert Lee
Norris, ``conveyed an implied message encouraging the jury to find
Norris guilty,'' said a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The buttons ``posed a serious and imminent threat to Norris'
right to a fair trial,'' the court said.
   Assistant Attorney General Paul Johnson said Thursday the state
has not decided whether to appeal.
   Norris, who remains in prison, acted as his own lawyer in
appealing the conviction. He was convicted of the January 1983
kidnapping and rape of a 15-year-old girl he allegedly lured to his
Billings home with a false advertisement for a babysitter.
   About 15 members of the Billings Rape Task Force and the
National Organization for Women appeared at Johnson's arraignment
wearing 2{-inch-wide ``Women Against Rape'' buttons that had been
designed for the case, and three women wore them at the trial, the
court said.
   Judge Charles Luedke had denied a defense request to prohibit
the buttons during the trial, saying the women were exercising
their right to free expression.
   The appeals court said those rights are outweighed by a
defendant's right to a fair trial.
   Judge Robert Boochever, who wrote the appeals court opinion,
cited a 1985 West Virginia ruling overturning a drunken driving
conviction because spectators wore buttons from the group Mothers
Against Drunk Drivers.

<TEXT>
   A University of Utah scientist who claims
to have discovered a cold fusion energy process said Thursday he
``sterile furor'' over his whereabouts last month was unfortunate
and unnecessary.
   B. Stanley Pons ducked reporters Wednesday, his first appearance
in Utah in weeks. He issued a statement to reporters the next day,
when he met with an advisory council evaluating his work and
related research.
   Pons and colleague Martin Fleischmann caused a stir when they
missed a council meeting two weeks ago and left Utah, apparently
without making their destinations known to officials of the
university or the university's National Cold Fusion Institute.
   Fleischmann returned to his home in Tisbury, England, for
medical treatment and did not return for the review, said Fritz
Will, director of the state-funded institute.
   ``Obviously, the fact that we did not publish our itinerary
seems to have caused considerable distress to some people, which is
regrettable,'' Pons said in a news release.
   Pons called the commotion over his disappearance a ``sterile
furor'' and said he spent the time ``traveling.''
   He met with the Fusion Energy Advisory Council. Council chairman
Raymond Hixson said Pons has made research advances that are the
basis of a ninth patent application on cold fusion.
   The episode cast yet another shadow over the research that was
unveiled on March 23, 1989, when the two announced at a news
conference they had achieved a sustained nuclear fusion reaction in
a simple tabletop experiment that produced more energy in the form
of heat that was used to run it.
   Fusion long has been sought as a potential source of cheap and
virtually inexhaustible energy.
   But few scientists have been able to duplicate their work and
many remain skeptical.
   Researchers around the world have spent billions of dollars
trying to reach that same energy surplus from hot fusion, the
process that powers the sun and stars by combining, or fusing, two
hydrogen atoms into a heavier helium atom.
   Attorneys for the state, which appropriated $5 million for the
research last year, have filed for eight patents relating to cold
fusion, which the scientists believe may someday be used as an
energy source. The council oversees the funding.
   Pons and Fleischmann contend they were not told to attend an
advisory council meeting they were criticized for missing two weeks
ago.
   Pons would not answer reporters' questions Thursday.
   ``People who want to contact us do not seem to have any
problem,'' he said in the statement, contradicting university
officials and others who said he was unreachable, except through
his attorney.
   In the news release, Pons said he and Fleischmann had applied
for a new patent on ``very important'' research.
   ``We have also written two new papers describing this work,
which we expect to submit as soon as their release does not negate
granting of patent protection,'' Pons said.

<HEAD>California Adopts Roadside Pollution Tests for Big Rigs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California smog squads will begin
random roadside testing next spring of diesel smoke from heavy
trucks and buses under a program adopted Thursday by the state Air
Resources Board.
   The program, approved 7-1, will apply to all such vehicles in
the state regardless of where they are registered.
   It asks ``truck and bus operators to do more than what owners of
gasoline-powered cars have done since 1984 through the Smog Check
program,'' said the board's executive officer, Jim Boyd.
   The program requires the testing and repairing - if necessary -
of gasoline-powered passenger cars every two years.
   The state already has two programs to control diesel emissions,
but originated the new one because of new medical findings.
   The board said the research on sootlike particles in diesel
smoke shows that some of them are small enough to get through the
body's natural filtering system and cause tissue damage deep in the
lung. The particles also can carry potentially cancer-causing
compounds, including dioxin and benzene.
   Moreover, diesel emissions are the single largest source of
public complaints that the board receives about pollution, Boyd
said.
   He said 10,000 complaints a month are received under a Southern
California program in which the California Highway Patrol seeks to
issue tickets to smoking trucks reported by the public.
   California Trucking Association spokesman Gregory deGiere said:
``We generally support the program and we believe it can be made to
work, and we hope that during the one-year test period it will be
made to work.''
   He said his association represents 2,500 owners of the trucks
that carry about 80 percent of all trucked cargo in California.
   An opacity test is to be made while the engine is revving at
full throttle as in rapid acceleration. Vehicles with peak smoke
density above 55 percent, nearly equal to their emissions when new,
will be cited. Owners will have 45 days to lower the emissions.
   First-time violators will be subject to a $300 fee. For a second
violation within a year, the fines are as high as $1,800.
   The roving smog squads, 12 in all, will consist of Air Resources
Board and California Highway Patrol employees. They will
concentrate on weigh stations and other places where the vehicles
are standing still anyway. They expect to test about 38,000
vehicles a year.
   While they concentrate on the estimated 250,000 diesel trucks
and buses driven in California, they will also be looking for
chances to inspect the estimated 200,000 large gasoline-powered
vehicles, like motor homes and delivery trucks, to prevent
tampering with anti-smog systems.
   The board's research shows that the greatest causes of diesel
soot are tampering to increase acceleration and neglecting
maintenance.
   A pilot program showed that the average repair cost to lower
emissions was $500.
   California's new program is only the sixth of its kind in the
nation.
   State officials said it will target the dirtiest one-third of
the trucks and buses that produce up to 70 percent of the 85 tons a
day of particulates emitted in the state. Overall emissions from
the entire fleet should drop by 17 percent and as much as
two-thirds from individual vehicles.

   A judge on Thursday dismissed charges against a
record store chain in connection with sales of a 2 Live Crew rap
album that has been ruled obscene.
   Dallas County Criminal Court Judge George Shepherd said eight
misdemeanor charges against Sound Warehouse Inc. for the sale of
the album, ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be,'' were dropped at
prosecutors' request.
   Assistant District Attorney Mike Sullivan said the county would
drop the case as long as the recording, which was deemed obscene by
a federal judge in Florida, was not sold in Sound Warehouse stores.
   Last month in Florida, members of the rap group were acquitted
of obscenity charges stemmig from an adults-only performance at a
nightclub, and a record store owner was convicted of obscenity for
selling the album.

   Country music listeners of radio station
WSTT could be in for a shock this weekend when the California
winner of an MTV contest claims ownership of the station and hits
the airwaves with guest Billy Idol.
   Chris McCarron, a disk jockey at Cerritos Community College
station KCEB, was selected at random from about 250,000 people who
took part in the nationwide contest, MTV promotions director David
Cohn said Thursday.
   McCarron won $10,000 in cash along with the station, which she
can either keep or trade for an undisclosed cash sum. She is
scheduled to visit the country-western format station Saturday,
when Idol will a guest on the air.
   ``I can't wait to see Georgia,'' she said. ``The first guy I
ever had a crush on was from Georgia. I just fell in love with the
accent.''
   MTV had an option to buy WSTT, Cohn said, declining to say how
much the music video television network agreed to pay for the
station.
   Idol, a punk-style rock star known for his characteristic sneer
and metal-studded leather outfits, will be something of a change
for the country music fans who tune in WSTT. Idol's visit was part
of McCarron's prize.
   ``We're thrilled with the whole thing,'' said a station employee
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's not going to hurt us
either way.''
   The new owner is free to change the format of the 1,000-watt AM
station, Cohn said. McCarron said she doesn't know what she'll do.
   ``I can't think seriously about it until I see the station and
talk to everybody,'' she said. ``I'm just excited about checking it
out this weekend.'' Cerritos College is located in Torrance,
Calif., near Los Angeles. Thomasville is in southwestern Georgia
near the state's border with Florida, about 50 miles north of
Tallahassee.

<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic priest once accused of
lying in the trial of socialite Claus von Bulow was indicted
Thursday on charges of stealing about $200,000 from his church.
   The Rev. A. Philip Magaldi ``regularly skimmed money from the
weekly church collections and embezzled funds from several parish
accounts,'' using the money to buy lottery tickets, take vacations
to the Virgin Islands and Montreal and give gifts to his friends,
Attorney General James O'Neil said.
   A grand jury indicted Magaldi on 11 charges. They include
embezzlement, larceny, soliciting another to commit a larceny, each
of which carry a maximum sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a
$5,000 fine; five counts of forgery, each of which carry a maximum
sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a $1,000 fine; and three
counts of filing false documents, punishable by up to one year in
prison and a $1,000 fine.
   Magaldi, 54, resigned from St. Anthony's in May 1988. William
Halpin, a spokesman for the Providence Diocese, said he could not
comment on why Magaldi left. Magaldi currently is pastor at St.
Mary's Church in Henrietta, Texas.
   He did not return messages left Thursday on the answering
machine at the church. Magaldi was scheduled to be arraigned in
Providence Superior Court on Nov. 28 and his lawyer has indicated
the priest will be present, O'Neil said.
   Magaldi was involved in the case of von Bulow, who was acquitted
in a second trial in 1985 of twice trying to murder his heiress
wife with insulin injections at their Newport mansion.
   The priest was indicted in 1985 on perjury and obstruction
charges for allegedly lying in a sworn statement he gave in support
of von Bulow in 1983. The charges were dropped in June 1987 by the
attorney generl's office, which cited insufficient evidence.

   It started as a sleeper among issues, but the
drive to limit politicians' terms is awake and kicking now, and the
people pushing the idea say they'll seek to put it on at least 15
state ballots in 1992.
   Claiming headway in both the victories and frustrations of
Tuesday's off-year elections, term-limit campaigners will meet in
Washington early next month to talk about their next steps.
   While the immediate target is the state legislatures, their
ultimate aim is to limit tenure in Congress.
   Term limits were approved Tuesday in Colorado and California,
the two states that had the issue on the ballot and, for good
measure, in Kansas City, Mo., which put a ceiling on city council
tenure. Oklahoma voted for term limits earlier in the fall.

Connecticut and Alaska in a historic warning to Republicans and
Democrats that they aren't the only choices in American politics.
   But experts are saying the winners are not true independents and
that if they hope to get anything done, they won't stay independent
for long.
   In Connecticut, former U.S. Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. completed
a political comeback Tuesday with a narrow victory in a three-way
field. In Alaska, former Gov. Walter Hickel was the winner in
another close, three-way race.
   Their victories mean two independent governors will be in office

   Norwegian scientists are exploring the
possibility of a year-round route through the frozen ocean north of
Siberia that could change the way the world does business.
   Unlike their Viking ancestors, who braved unknown seas in wooden
ships, these modern adventurers search from laboratories, with
computers and calculators.
   Oslo's Fridtjof Nansen Institute, named for the Norwegian
explorer, was enlisted by the Soviet Merchant Marine Ministry to
explore the feasibility of opening the Northeast Passage all year.
   The Soviets envision huge icebreakers leading merchant ships
through the polar icepack like outsize ducklings trailing their
mother.
   Willy Oestreng, director of the institute, said the 4,000-mile
passage north of the Soviet Union is the shortest route between
Europe and the Far East, about half the distance through the Suez
or Panama canals.
   ``It could revolutionize world shipping,'' he said. The study
began formally at the end of October, after two years of
discussion.
   Adolf Erik Nordenskiold, a Finnish-Swedish explorer and
scientist, first negotiated the ice-congested passage between
northern Norway and Alaska in a daring two-year steamship voyage
that ended in 1879.
   A combination of ice ridges 42 feet thick, bitter cold,
four-month winter nights and Soviet strategic concerns have
prevented the shortcut, often called the Northern Sea Route, from
becoming an important factor in world trade.
   Oestreng said changes in the Soviet Union and the raw power of
modern icebreakers had helped overcome the obstacles.
   He said the Soviets believe their icebreakers, which now clear
the passage from July to October for the Soviet coastal trade,
might be able to open it all year.
   Soviet officials hope the route will generate hard currency from
fees paid to use the passage and hire Soviet ships, and stimulate
the economy of isolated Siberia and the arctic coast, Oestreng
said.
   Norwegian and outside experts will study the technological
challenges, costs, legal and political questions, and the
environmental impact of keeping the passage open, Oestreng said. He
added that the eight-month pilot project would ``define the state
of the art'' of arctic navigation.
   ``The main questions are commerciality and the environment,'' he
said, and further research will be required if the pilot project is
encouraging, but ``if everything fell into place, it could be open
in a decade.''
   His institute, which has specialists in polar research, raised
$200,000 for the study from various Norwegian sources.
   ``The Soviets had nothing to pay with ... and Norway, as a
traditional shipping nation, has to get in on this,'' Oestreng
explained.
   Scientists and environmentalists are concerned about the threat
of oil spills or nuclear accidents.
   ``We would be opposed to using nuclear icebreakers to keep the
passage open,'' said Steve Shallhorn, a Greenpeace activist from
Canada, who toured a Soviet icebreaker base in the arctic on Sept.
24.
   Shuttle traffic of nuclear icebreakers or oil-laden tankers
could threaten the arctic's fragile ecology, Shallhorn said.
   Environmental concerns arising from the Exxon Valdez oil spill
in Alaska may make the Northeast Passage commercially viable 111
years after it was discovered.
   Some oil tankers are being ordered with double hulls, a feature
intended to prevent oil spills, and ``that would go far toward the
requirements of arctic conditions,'' said Arnfinn Jorgensen-Dahl of
the Nansen Institute.
   He said the thick-hulled ships needed to endure the ice of the
Northeast Passage once were deemed too expensive, but ``now,
concern for the environment may be about to even out prices between
vessels built for arctic and non-arctic waters.''
   Oestreng emphasized that the arctic is a harsh place, and
cautioned the overly optimistic: ``We'd better not sell the skin
before the bear's been shot.''

<HEAD>Conservationists Try to Spread Awareness and Save Wetlands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA CASTANEDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poverty and violence are much more
pressing issues in Latin America than the environment, but 16 years
of quiet, steady work to save wetlands is showing results.
   Ducks Unlimited, a non-profit group associated with similar
groups in the United States, Canada and New Zealand, is dedicated
to preserving the natural habitat of more than 50 species of
migratory waterfowl.
   It is particularly active in Mexico, which ranks third among the
world's nations in the diversity of bird and animal life.
   ``Conservation is a luxury in a country like ours, but at the
same time it is very much a necessity,'' said Eric Gustafson, vice
president of Ducks Unlimited, which is based in Monterrey. ``The
lowly swamps that in the past have been drained have proven to be
the seedbed of all life.
   ``For the poor, wildlife is a source of food, but this wildlife
must be cared for because many species endemic to Mexico are being
threatened with extinction. We need to teach them to consume the
ones that are abundant and conserve others.''
   His organization has completed 90 projects in Mexico and two in
Honduras, and has trained national park employees from Argentina,
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Equador, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Panama, Uruguay, Peru and Venezuela.
   It has investigation centers in Nuevo Leon and Coahuila states
in northern Mexico, and in the southern state of Yucatan.
   Gustafson said Mexico is ripe for environmental activism because
of its varied topography, ranging from tropical rain forests and
deserts to mountains and thousands of miles of beaches.
   He added that ``there is lots of land still untouched by man.''
   Ducks Unlimited has focused on reforestation, rehabilitation of
wetlands and adding shoreline by building dams, pools, lagoons and
islands with nesting boxes and vegetation. Gustafson said it had
developed more than 860,000 acres of wetlands.
   ``Other animals, like deer, jaguar and doves also benefit
because they drink the water,'' he said.
   Habitat for ducks, geese and cranes is disappearing and several
species are threatened because of pollution, expanded oil
exploration and agriculture, he said, and described the goal of his
group to an interviewer:
   ``You can conserve a species in a zoo. What we want to do is
conserve them in the habitat where wildlife lives and breeds in its
natural state. That includes providing water, food, cover and
space.''
   Ducks Unlimited works with landowners, operators of state-run
farms, educational institutions and the government to help spread
community awareness.
   He said farmers are asked to leave rows of natural vegetation
when they clear land, so wildlife has somewhere to feed. The
organization also tries to persuade hunters not to exceed daily
limits.
   Water contamination has become a major problem because of
industrial pollution, pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers.
   Gustafson said his group is working with government agencies on
legislation to fight water pollution, especially in the
drought-prone north.
   Techniques developed by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in the United States make it possible to grow plants
that cleanse polluted water by feeding on contaminants and
expelling chlorophyll.
   ``We don't pretend to make it potable,'' Gustafson said, ``but
wildlife can certainly live off it.''
   Waterfowl from North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana
and Alaska and the western Canadian provinces of Manitoba, Alberta
and Saskatchewan winter in Mexico, he said.
   In September, October and November, the birds head south along
the Pacific, Central, Mississippi and Atlantic flyways.
   Mexico has 1,051 native species of birds, 447 species of
mammals, 685 of reptiles and 284 of amphibians, making it third in
biological diversity after Brazil and Colombia. Of the total, 342
are considered endangered, Gustafson said.
   Ducks Unlimited has 12,000 members and a staff of 35. Its annual
budget of $1.5 million is raised through donations, art auctions,
banquets and membership drives.
   The organization now is appealing for new members to help with
Project 2000, a 10-year plan to rehabilitate 28 wetland areas where
about 83 percent of Mexico's waterfowl live.
   ``Wildlife and habitat are intimately related to man,''
Gustafson said.
   ``They are a food source and oxygen source. Without habitat,
there would be no wildlife. I don't see how human life would
survive.''

<HEAD>`Jeeves and Wooster' Bows on PBS, `Psycho IV' on Showtime -
Coincidence?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What, ho! ``Jeeves and Wooster,'' a sublime,
droll, understated British comedy of manners adapted from the
classic tales of P.G. Wodehouse, opens on Sunday for a five-week
run on PBS' ``Masterpiece Theater.''
   Jeeves, the ingenious and unflappable manservant, and Bertie
Wooster, his adorable, vacuous, upperclass twit of a master, were
introduced to readers in a 1915 Saturday Evening Post story titled
``Extricating Young Gussie.''
   By 1975, when Wodehouse (pronounced WOOD-house) died at his home
on Long Island, Jeeves and Bertie had figured in 15 novels and
scads of stories, set in the mythical London and great British
country houses of the '20s and '30s.
   It was there that Bertie, amid grinding affluence and elegant
furnishings (Art Deco is a trifle too ``modern'' for our Wooster!),
divided his time between his club (the Drones) and loafing about
Mayfair getting into scrapes.
   Bertie's a frightfully decent chap and fancies himself a master
schemer and solver of life's small problems, but his machinations
always go awry, requiring the intervention of Jeeves (``Indeed,
sir?'') to get him out of trouble.
   Broken engagements, pranks gone wrong and the loss of a
treasured cook are as dire as Wodehouse gets. It's Bertie's aunts,
``screaming to each other like mastodons across a great, primeval
swamp,'' that mar his existence.
   It is his dreadnought Aunt Agatha who figures prominently in the
opening episode of Clive Exton's knowing adaptation.
   Bertie, somewhat the worse for drink at break of day, stumbles
into his stylish, yet disheveled bachelor flat and collapses onto
his bed. A persistent ringing at the door. Bertie stumbles to open
it.
   A tallish chap in black morning coat and striped trousers is
outside. He utters the immortal words: ``I was sent by the agency,
sir. I was given to understand you need a valet. My name is
Jeeves.''
   Within moments, Jeeves has set the flat to rights and revived
the flagging Wooster with a healing draught. Jeeves's remarkable
restorative within him, Bertie instantly engages Jeeves' services.
   Ah, but like a specter of doom or lingering hangover, Aunt
Agatha (Mary Wimbush) summons the doomed innocent to luncheon and
the dreadful news that it is time that Bertie marry and that the
statuesque Honoria Glossop, is the girl.
   Bertie, filled with dread, shuttles down to Sir Roderick and
Lady Glossop's country home to consummate a done deal; there he
meets his old chum ``Bingo'' Little (Michael Siberry), who
announces an undying love for the fair Honoria.
   Bertie sees a way out and confects an implausible scheme which
goes hilariously wrong. Jeeves extracts him from the dire
consequences of his lamebrained scheme. That, essentially, is the
pattern of their adventures.
   Slight stuff, you say? Perhaps. But where else but in Wodehouse
could we meet such characters as Tuppy Glossop, Oofy Prosser,
Gussie Fink-Nottle, Hildegard Watt-Watson and the Rev. Beefy
Bellinger?
   And where else could would we fine Wodehouse's remarkable
dialogue? It is irreproducible here, but Exton, director Robert
Young and producer Brian Eastman (``Traffik'') were painstaking in
their evocation of Wodehouse's world. How lucky the reader to
discover Jeeves and Bertie! Lucky, too, the viewer who finds
``Jeeves and Wooster'' on PBS and encounters the British comedy
team of Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie in the principal roles.
   Fry is ``a solemn procession of one'' as the prescient Jeeves,
and the exopthalmic Laurie is one of the greatest ditherers since
Stan Laurel, capable of making his extremities seem simultaneously
bound in different directions.
   Fry and Laurie met as undergraduates at Cambridge University and
appeared in its ``Footlights Revue,'' the launching ground of many
celebrated British performers.
   They went on to costar on British TV in ``A Bit of Fry and
Laurie'' and have appeared in the British comedy seires ``Black
Adder'' (on some PBS stations). ``Fry and Laurie'' is currently on
cable's Bravo network.
   In addition, Fry wrote the book for the revival of ``Me and My
Girl,'' a hit on Broadway and in London's West End.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   WHAT DO YOU MEAN GET IN THE SHOWER AND PLAY DEAD? DEPT. -
``Psycho IV: The Beginning,'' a made-for-cable prequel of the
Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense film opens Saturday night
on Showtime.
   It of course stars the wonderful Anthony Perkins, who created
the role of psychotic killer Norman Bates 30 years ago and is
determined to hold onto the franchise as well as his title as Cable
Television's Finest Actor.
   A pity. This semiscary thriller starts wonderfully and ends
pitifully. There are luminous performances by full-grown Henry
Thomas (remember Elliot in ``E.T.''?) as young Norman, and Olivia
Hussey as his sexually torturing Mother.
   It also boasts Graeme Revell's nice adaptation of the original
Bernard Herrmann score, but who's listening?
   ``Psycho'' screenwriter Joseph Stefano had some leftover bits
from the original movie, detailing what made Norman the charming
host he was. Those scenes, with Thomas and Hussey's brilliant,
steamy performances, illuminate this dull movie like flashes of
lighting.
   The rest of ``Psycho IV'' relies on loud noises to startle you.
   
   THE REAL THRILLER DEPT. - Showtime also presents, immediately
after ``Psycho IV,'' the original ``Psycho,'' newly remastered and
with enhanced digital sound, UNCUT AND COMMERCIAL FREE. Pounce,
timeshifters, pounce!

<HEAD>An Utterly Different Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This may be a very different recession from
those in the past, according to reports from around the country.
   Past recessions often began when overly eager producers turned
out more goods than the economy could absorb, leading to inventory
buildups and then to slower production and layoffs in order to
shrink those inventories.
   This one, says Albert Sindlinger, an economic researcher, began
with the consumer's pocketbook rather than production inventories.
   People all over the country are telling him, ``My expenses are
rising.'' That, he said, is the universal complaint. ``People are
saying their medical costs, insurance costs, their taxes are too
much.''
   At the same time, he said, their assets probably are falling in
value. Some housing prices have shrunk. Stock values, too. ``And as
their assets decline ad costs rise, their incomes aren't
adequate,'' he said.
   Atop these problems is the loss of jobs. Government figures show
580,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing since January 1989.
Initial claims for jobless insurance rose to 454,000 in the week
ended Oct. 20, the highest level since the last recession. While
costs rise, ability to pay falls.
   The voting results confirm the taxpayers' predicament and their
outrage, said Sindlinger, who has been analyzing consumer attitudes
for half a century, the latest 30 years of that time in a formal,
scientific manner.
   Based in Wallingford, Pa., the staff of Sindlinger &amp; Co. has
detailed talks with more than 800 heads of households every week,
52 weeks a year, asking them probing questions relating to their
financial condition.
   Those results are then processed at the company's computer
facility and analyzed by the octogenarian himself, and then sent by
high-speed mail or facsimile to corporate, governmental and
academic clients.
   Looking at last week's results, he commented that ``the economy
keeps getting worse.'' By his calculations, there are 38 states in
recession, and the rest are borderline. The recession is already in
its 10th month, he says.
   The Commerce Department disagrees. Its latest quarterly report,
for the third quarter of the year, showed economic activity growing
at an unexpectedly strong 1.8 percent annual rate.
   Sindlinger scoffs at the estimate, and so do many academic and
business economists. Some, such as Sindlinger, believe the figures
are manipulated; some believe government methodology is faulty;
some say almost-certain revisions will lower the expansion rate.
   Based on discussions with household heads, Sindlinger believes
the latest tax increase enraged the American public. ``Atop all
their problems, it was the very thing they didn't need.'' And, he
said, they perceive it as unjust.
   He said President Bush is receiving much of the blame.
   On Sept. 17, the president's positive rating, as Sindlinger
measured it, was 82.6 percent, which he says translates into
approval by 129 million Americans. By Oct. 29 it was down to 48.1
percent, or 75.3 million.
   Blame it on the tax increase, said Sindlinger. While you can't
pin the entire blame for recession on taxes, he said, you can say
the tax increase will make the recession much deeper than it would
have been.
   It was suicidal, he said, ``politically and economically.''

<HEAD>The Man Behind ``Sir Norbert Smith: A Life''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Program to be broadcast on most PBS stations Nov. 16</NOTE>
<HEAD>Laserphoto</HEAD>

   His career encompassed film classics from ``Oh,
Mr. Bankrobber'' to ``Rebel Without A Tie.''
   With Noel Coward, he adapted ``Hamlet'' - ``Very nice,
Denmark,'' went the dialogue. He sang ``You've Got To Heat the
Pot'' in the rollicking 1960s musical, ``Keep Your Hair On
Daddio.''
   Sir Norbert Smith is perhaps the most illustrious British actor
who never existed. Fans of British comedy at its nuttiest will love
the tribute, ``Sir Norbert Smith: A Life,'' broadcast Friday on
public television's ``Great Performances.''
   ``It's an affectionate send-up,'' says 29-year-old Harry
Enfield, who dons a flowing white beard and genially bled
manner to play the distinguished octogenarian.
   The script by Enfield and Geoffrey Perkins traces Sir Norbert's
life from childhood - ``his father was a man, his mother a woman,''
we are told - through excerpts from films such as the gentle
``Rover Returns Home'' and the angry ``Carry On Banging,'' about
nuclear disarmament.
   No movie genre escapes unscathed, from the dopiest of film
biographies to Britain's grim working-class films of the 1960s.
   Will Americans find it funny?
   ``It depends on how many British films they've seen,'' Enfield
said in an interview.
   Sir Norbert is seen being questioned by Melvyn Bragg, the
television personality who conducted a celebrated interview with
Laurence Olivier in 1985.
   But Enfield said Sir Norbert is meant less as a specific Olivier
parody than as a synthesis of British greats. Aficionados will spot
references to Sir John Gielgud, Peter O'Toole and Donald Sinden,
among many others.
   The actors not sent up in the Sir Norbert character get their
comeuppance from fictitious colleagues such as Will Silly and Sir
Donald Stuffy.
   ``I put in every British actor that I've ever met,'' said
Enfield, who worked six years ``off and on'' on the script, and
found periodic unemployment a great help.
   ``I used to watch a lot of afternoon TV,'' he said. ``I started
imitating the movies then.''
   ``Sir Norbert Smith: A Life'' marked a change of pace for the
performer, who studied politics at York University before making
his theater debut at the Edinburgh Festival fringe in Scotland in
1982.
   ``It was the first time I'd had to do comedy acting rather than
overacting,'' he said of Sir Norbert. ``It's part of the difference
between Robin Williams on stage and Robin Williams in `Dead Poets
Society.' ''
   In 1986, his career was launched playing Loadsamoney, an
avaricious working-class Yuppie, on ``Friday Night Live,'' a weekly
comedy series.
   The character touched such a nerve with the British that the
word was later cited in Parliamentary debates about Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's ``loadsamoney economy.''
   Enfield later created the character of Stavros, a Greek kebab
salesman with opinions on everything.
   In contrast to Loadsamoney, described by Enfield as ``a loud
git,'' Sir Norbert demanded a more subdued, concentrated style of
acting, with a chameleonic ability to switch from the aging
thespian to his younger cinematic selves.
   A new series, ``Harry Enfield's Television Program,'' began this
month on the BBC. Enfield takes on 15 roles, ranging from a
13-year-old with a speech problem to a pair of married slobs, Wayne
and Waynetta.
   The son of a local government officer from East Sussex, south of
London, Enfield seems moderately surprised by the direction his
life has taken. But he views it with a Loadsamoney kind of
pragmatism.
   ``It's something I fell into,'' he said. ``I'll stop doing it
when they stop paying me.''

   Andras Hegedues was 32, a peasant's son
and committed Communist, when he went to Warsaw as premier of
Hungary in May 1955 to help found an alliance he believed could
ensure peace in Europe.
   Thirty-five years later, after much reflection and a personal
rebellion that got him expelled from the Communist Party, Hegedues
has very different ideas about peace and the Warsaw Pact's ability
to guarantee it.
   The Soviet-led military alliance created on May 14, 1955, is
fading into history, helped by a vigorous push from his own
country. Hegedues is the only living signer of the treaty.
   Hungary revolted in 1956 and Soviet tanks rushed in. Hegedues
and other Communist faithful were evacuated to Moscow during the
bloody fighting that followed, and he began to reconsider his
beliefs.
   He criticized the next use of Warsaw Pact tanks against a
member, when a Soviet-led invasion crushed the ``Prague Spring'' of
1968.
   Hegedues eventually was expelled from the Communist Party and
forced to retire into writing and study. In 1979, he helped found
the European Nuclear Disarament group.
   These days, he worries about how to keep history from repeating
itself.
   ``The Warsaw Pact is now actually a piece of fiction,'' he said
in an interview. ``The military command no longer has an army at
its disposal. It's a group of generals without soldiers.''
   On Nov. 3, officials of the six Warsaw Pact members met in
Budapest to divide up what conventional weapons they may keep under
an East-West agreement to be signed Monday in Paris.
   It may be their last major decision. Hungary and Czechoslovakia
want the alliance to finish its military business in 1991, and
other members appear to agree.
   In the last year, Communist regimes have fallen throughout the
former Soviet bloc. East Germany has ceased to exist, and the
united Germany so feared in Moscow and other Eastern capitals is a
fact once again.
   As a Communist in World War II, Hegedues lived through the Nazi
occupation in a Hungarian jail run by the SS.
   The Warsaw Pact, signed a few days after West Germany joined the
NATO alliance in 1955, seemed to him a way of protecting Hungary
from Germany.
   East-West ideological confrontation was at its peak. There were
fears of a third world war and Hegedues accepted Josef Stalin's
image of the West.
   ``It was a totally irrational image of a non-existent enemy, but
it played a strong role,'' he said.
   Hegedues believes Stalin wanted war, but that Nikita S.
Khrushchev, who had succeeded the dictator by 1955, was more
interested in expanding communism through economic strength.
   At the Warsaw Pact signing, the Soviets went out of their way to
emphasize civilian control, even to the clothing worn by Soviet
Premier Nikolai Bulganin, Hegedues and leaders of Albania, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and East Germany. Albania left
the pact in 1968, after breaking with Moscow.
   The atmosphere in Warsaw was informal and the generals were kept
in the background.
   ``I took a dressy suit, but I never wore it once,'' Hegedues
recalled. ``The word came down from the Soviets what Bulganin was
going to wear, and everybody else dressed accordingly.''
   In 1990, still involved in research and investigating the roots
of Europe's postwar division, Hegedues rejects the rationale for
the Warsaw Pact.
   He believes the Western Allies' decision to invade Italy in 1943
rather than drive toward Germany from the Balkans was partially
intended to cause the Soviet Union more casualties and weaken it
after the war. Instead, the West gave away Eastern Europe.
   Hegedues feels disarmament, neutrality and renunciation of any
effort to redraw borders can keep Central Europe from becoming a
battleground once more.
   German reunification, accomplished in October, was inevitable
and a neutral Germany would have been ideal, but was unrealistic,
he said. United Germany is a member of NATO.
   Political and economic alliances of neutral nations are needed
to counter a strong Germany, Hegedues said. He believes Hungary
should seek its future with peoples of the former Austro-Hungarian
Empire, such as the Slovenes and Croats in Yugoslavia, plus the
traditionally neutral Swiss.
   Such an alliance offers the Austrians and Swiss an organized
market if the European Community is hesitant to expand, in
Hegedues' view. He said Poland should have similar goals with the
neutral Scandinavian countries and the Baltic republics seeking
independence from Moscow.
   Any such system would require the nations of Central and Eastern
Europe to give up the territorial claims that caused two world
wars, Hegedues said. He concluded:
   ``Cooperation is the only possible way, and the implementation
of human rights.''

<HEAD>Rural Birth Rate Dropping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the relatively good times of the late
1970s, millions of city people dreamed about moving to the country.
A good many did.
   For a time, Agriculture Department demographers and many other
experts thought a turnaround had come and that rural America would
start gaining population again.
   But the dream ended when things got tougher in the 1980s, and
the countryside resumed its old trend of losing people to the
bright lights of cities.
   There is some evidence that a modest recovery occurred in the
late 1980s as economic conditions improved, according to USDA
analysts. But it's spotty and not necessarily the start of another
stampede to the bucolic life.
   Also, according to one report, the rural birth rate has slowed
and has even lost its traditional edge over city birth rates.
   Demographer Calvin Beale of the Agriculture Department's
Economic Research Service and rural sociologist Glenn Fugitt of the
University of Wisconsin-Madison say there are many reasons for
thinking the decade of the '80s ended on an optimistic note.
   Part of their study was directed at population changes among the
nation's 1,565 ``non-metro'' counties - nearly two-thirds of the
total - that had a net movement of people out of those counties
from 1980 to 1988.
   The so-called outmigration meant a net loss of 1,965,000 people
from these counties during the period. But nearly offsetting these
losses was the movement of 1,943,00 people into 817 non-metro
counties.
   ``These two classes of counties tend to be located in different
parts of the country,'' the report said.
   For example, the outmigration from non-metro counties was
widespread in the Corn Belt, Mississippi Delta, many parts of the
Great Plains, and Idaho's Snake River Valley.
   Similar losses occurred in southern coal fields and many
non-metro industrial counties of the Northeast and eastern Midwest,
the report said. Newly depressed mining areas in the West also
suffered, including many in Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico.
   The gainers were more concentrated. Several counties in Florida
and California grew by more than 40,000 from migration alone,
compared to a loss of no more than 12,000 people by any one of
those counties.
   Other areas that showed increases in county populations included
New England, along the South Atlantic coast, Ozarks, Texas hill
country, north-central California, Hawaii and the Pacific
Northwest.
   A metropolitan area by government definition one that includes a
city of at least 50,000 or is part of a defined urbanized area.
Non-metro areas are places that don't have close economic contact
with cities.
   Strictly speaking, according to demographers, the terms
``rural'' and ``urban'' are designations that relate to places
rather than population density. For example, said one USDA expert,
non-metro areas aren't close to cities. But a metropolitan area
could include farms and other ``rural'' land.
   The net loss of only 22,000 people by the non-metro counties
``may seem trivial and unbelievably small in light of the serious
consequences for the rural economy'' in the early and mid-1980s,
the report said.
   But when the overall number is broken down into components to
show where losses and increases occurred in those years, the
statistics are significant.
   The decline in non-metro population during most of the 1980s -
until the upturn late in the decade - also can be attributed to
``an actual drop in birth rates among non-metro women of
childbearing age,'' the report said.
   ``Although women living in non-metro areas have traditionally
had larger families than those in metro areas, there is no longer
any apparent differences in the childbearing expectations of the
two groups,'' it added.
   According to the Census Bureau's 1988 survey of expected
lifetime fertility, women 18 to 34 years old in both groups
expected to average 207 lifetime births per 100 women.
   ``This is a number that is marginally below that needed for
replacement of the childbearing generation when mortality of
children is taken into account,'' the report said.
   Moreover, it was the first time in the 16-year history of the
fertility survey that non-metro women did not expect to average
more births than metro women.
   ``Unless the birth rate rises, the non-metro population will
ultimately become totally dependent on (incoming migration) for
further overall growth or retention of current levels,'' the report
said. ``In a number of non-metro counties, that is already
happening.''
   Researchers did not foresee in the 1980s that the decade would
see a reduction in non-metro birth rates.
   ``The notion that rural and small-town families have more
children than do city families is one of the oldest and hitherto
most valid premises in demography,'' the report said.
   As to the future, there is uncertainty.
   ``There is room for still further lowering of the non-metro
birth rate, especially as more of the smaller post-baby boom birth
groups come of age,'' the report said. ``The same reasoning could
be applied to the metro population.''

<HEAD>Oil Industry Exec an Old Hand at Fending Off Gouging Charges</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also ran on financial wires</NOTE>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When world events send oil prices soaring, many
consumers start thinking of giant oil companies as a bunch of
villainous price-gougers.
   It's probably impossible to make most of them think otherwise,
but that doesn't stop Big Oil's chief spokesman from trying.
   American Petroleum Institute President Charles J. DiBona even
says that putting forth the industry's public relations defensive
during the latest oil crisis has been easier than in earlier oil
shocks. For one thing, the criticism has been milder.
   ``It's less intense for one reason: People aren't in lines,''
DiBona said in an interview as he prepared for yet another round of
pitching the industry's views to New York financial writers. As the
head of the leading oil trade group, the bespectacled 58-year-old
DiBona has to do so before Congress, in news conferences and on
television shows.
   DiBona said oil's defense against the inevitable charges of
price-gouging and profiteering was made easier by going on the
offense.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August, it didn't take a
genius to figure out which way oil prices would be heading. API
immediately geared up its public relations machinery to offer
explanations for the higher prices.
   About 1,600 reporters' phone calls poured in during the first
week of the crisis. An estimated 5,000 media phone calls came in
during the first three months.
   ``We made a major effort to get out early, present the facts
early,'' DiBona said. ``This was started on Aug. 2. On Aug. 9, I
gave a presentation, with charts, to kind of spell out what was
happening.''
   DiBona's latest charts show that wholesale gasoline prices have
not risen as quickly as crude oil prices, which he calls evidence
that no gouging is taking place. At one point during a media
briefing, DiBona was asked why sharp drops in crude oil prices
aren't followed by immediate falls in the price of gasoline at the
pump, even though higher crude often leads to quick rises at the
pump.
   ``That's a good question,'' the even-tempered DiBona replied.
   He went on to explain that major oil companies can't control
prices at the pump, so any gouging that might occur is happening
only on a local level. He also said that as oil was rising,
refiners and service stations realized they had to replace their
stocks with more expensive petroleum, so they might raise the
price, but when it goes down, companies are reluctant to sell their
current, high-priced stocks at a loss.
   DiBona's smooth presentation of Big Oil's line may also be
explained by his stature as an old hand when it comes to fending
off charges of gouging.
   A Rhodes scholar and former Navy man, DiBona was a special
consultant to President Richard M. Nixon and deputy director of the
White House's Energy Policy Office in 1973.
   DiBona joined Washington-based API in 1974 as executive vice
president and chief operating officer. He became president and
chief executive in 1979, just in time to steer the trade group
through the oil shocks brought on by the Iranian Revolution.
   DiBona sees one striking similarity in all oil crises: The
emergence of a member of Congress as oil's No. 1 enemy. In DiBona's
mind, it used to be Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, but he has been
replaced by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.
   Lieberman has held hearings into oil pricing and proposed a law
against price-gouging during national emergencies. He even talks of
bringing back the Windfall Profits Tax on domestic oil production,
fighting words to those in the oil business.
   ``There's usually one leading demagogue,'' DiBona said. ``That
used to be Metzenbaum. Right now, it's Lieberman, a person who
makes unfounded charges and who holds hearings and who makes the
charges very early on during a period of crisis and then takes no
trouble at all to give publicity to the information that comes up
later to demonstrate those charges are unfounded.''
   Asked about DiBona's comment, Lieberman said: ``I can't remember
when I was last called a demagogue, if ever. Normally, I would take
offense at it, but since I'm being called a demagogue by the
leading spokesman of the oil industry, I take it as a compliment, a
badge of honor.''
   DiBona, an economist, shows little patience for the industry's
more vocal critics, whom he says generally come from the ranks of
lawyers who have a dim understanding of economics.
   ``If they were all in Hungary or Poland, you would hold out no
hope for their economies ever becoming efficient,'' DiBona said.
   The oil companies claim they are unfairly attacked by
politicians who complain loudly about price-gouging, then say
nothing when subsequent investigations give the industry a clean
bill of health.
   When heating oil prices shot up last December, the industry was
investigated by about 15 state attorneys general, the Justice
Department and the Energy Department, the API says. All of the
probes found that heating oil prices had gone up because of an
unexpected cold snap, but the politicians held no news conferences
to announce those findings, it says.
   ``None of them showed any evidence of collusive behavior or
gouging,'' DiBona said. ``All of that's totally ignored.''
   DiBona realizes it would be impossible to make the public love
Big Oil, so he says he's happy just to get the industry's point of
view into the debate.
   Critics, however, accuse the oil industry of attempting to
control the debate by trotting out a mountain of statistics that
can be used to support any kind of explanation the companies want.
   The public's disgust of the industry, DiBona believes, dates
from the turn of the century, when the U.S. Supreme Court broke up
the Standard Oil trust in 1911. He says Big Oil's evil image has
been perpetuated by the fictional characterization of the
swaggering Texas oil man, like J.R. Ewing of TV's ``Dallas.''
   ``The Texans I know in the oil business are not like that at
all,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tom Holland Directs Sinister and Scary `The Stranger Within'</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tom Holland has spent his directing career
scaring people, but never more effectively than in the CBS movie
``The Stranger Within.''
   The movie, which airs Tuesday and stars Rick Schroder, Kate
Jackson and Chris Sarandon, has no slashers, no chain saws, no
gore, no special effects. The story is simple, straightforward and
very sinister: Jackson's young son is kidnapped and 16 years later
Schroder knocks on her door and says he is her long-lost child.
   ``Rick was cast when I got the job,'' Holland said. ``Everyone I
knew thought of Rick as everyone's favorite grandson. I thought it
would be interesting to help Rick find a new side - and a perverse
thrill to see him shock people. `That can't be Ricky Schroder. It
looks like Ricky Schroder. My God, it is Ricky Schroder, and he's
got a hammer in his hands!' ''
   Schroder is probably best-known as the child star of the movie
remake of ``The Champ'' and from the ``Silver Spoons'' TV series.
He later was seen as the young cowboy in the miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove.'' He became Rick instead of Ricky when he began playing older
roles.
   ``The Stranger Within,'' unlike most scary films, relies on
people and relationships. Bit by bit, the tension mounts until it
becomes truly terrifying - and satisfying in a way the slasher
movies can never be.
   ``It's the first television movie I've directed,'' said Holland,
a writer and director whose films include ``Fright Night,''
``Child's Play'' and ``Fatal Beauty.''
   ``I've been offered a lot of things, but I never read anything I
liked until this. It is, in fact, the best script I've ever gotten.
It's written by John Pielmeier, a playwright who wrote `Agnes of
God,' and he's sensational. It has great acting roles. It has great
words, great emotional subtext.''
   Holland said he was pleased when Kate Jackson, best-known for
the series ``Charlie's Angels'' and ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King,''
agreed to appear in the movie.
   ``Kate can really act,'' he said. ``She's more than a light
comedienne. She has some life experiences that she brings to her
work.''
   Jackson plays a widow living in Minnesota whose 3-year-old son
is abducted while she's grocery shopping. Sixteen years later, she
has put her life back together and has a boyfriend, played by
Sarandon, who has appeared in two other Holland pictures, ``Child's
Play'' and ``Fright Night.''
   When Schroder arrives and says he's her son, it's a shock, then
a joy. Slowly, it becomes a murderous nightmare.
   Holland took time away from his latest writing assignment, a
remake of ``Village of the Damned,'' to talk about ``The Stranger
Within.'' He sat on the patio of his home overlooking the San
Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles. Cooper, a German shepherd he
picked up as a puppy while shooting the movie on location in
Minnesota, romped nearby.
   He's scheduled to direct the ``Village of the Damned'' remake
sometime next year and also is planning to direct a movie by
``Miami Vice'' creator Anthony Yerkovich about motorcycle street
racing.
   His last writing assignment was a movie script called ``Crystal
Tower'' that currently is ``on hold.''
   ``That took a year out of my life,'' Holland said. ``It's a
fantasy and not really a star vehicle. As a child, King Arthur is
bewitched by Morgana, and Merlin throws Excalibur into the future
to seek his heir. The heir who comes back from the future is an
18-year-old high school student from America. We all have projects
that we like a lot that don't go.''
   Holland estimates he's written 10 scripts that never were
produced and eight that have been made. He considers that a good
average.
   He started as an actor in New York, working in such soap operas
as ``Love of Life,'' ``Time For Us'' and ``General Hospital.''
   ``I moved to Los Angeles and did a lot of episodic work,'' he
said. ``I had a role in the movie `Walk in the Spring Rain,' which
starred Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn. Then I started writing
novels, unsuccessfully. Next, I tried writing episodic television,
again unsuccessfully. Finally, I started writing spec scripts, and
from that got assignments for low-budget exploitation and horror
movies.
   ``The first time I got paid for writing was 1975. I still have a
copy of the check. It was an option for an original screenplay that
never got made.'' Despite the preponderance of horror films,
Holland said he's never had a great interest in them.
   ``It's the jobs I could get,'' he said. ``It took me eight years
to make it. I'd like to get away from it, but I'm going right back
into that seething cauldron. Working with special effects is very
slow and tedious. It takes a lot of planning as a director. It's
more mechanical than creative. In `Child's Play,' we had nine
puppeteers working at a time.''

   The Communist army starved 150,000 civilians to
death with the siege of Changchun during China's civil war,
according to a startling book, since banned, that was published by
the Chinese military.
   It also says a People's Liberation Army division led by Wang
Zhen, now vice president, smuggled opium during the war that
brought the Communists to power more than 40 years ago.
   In a break with Communist Party doctrine, the book questions
whether the battle to wrest the country from Chiang Kai-shek's
Nationalists was worth the cost, and implies the revolution has not
produced a better life.
   ``Chinese people killed hundreds of thousands of Chinese
people,'' the book says. ``For what? For socialism? For the
Communist Party? Was it worth it?''
   ``White Snow, Red Blood,'' was written by Zhang Zhenglu, a
43-year-old lieutenant colonel who based it on numerous Communist
Party documents, some classified, and interviews with surviving
Communist officers.
   Unlike previous Chinese war histories, Zhang's work strives to
be objective and rejects the official line that history books
should justify Communist rule. He dispenses praise and criticism in
roughly equal measure.
   The 618-page treatise, published in August 1989 by the People's
Liberation Army Publishing House, was suppressed this spring after
an army magazine quoted President Yang Shangkun as saying it
``insulted the Communist Party.'' By then, however, more than
100,000 copies had been sold.
   An army order banning the book is believed to have been issued
in March, but as is normal in China, was not made public. The book
was criticized in the state-run press and copies disappeared from
bookstores.
   A Chinese source in Hong Kong said Lt. Col Zhang was being
investigated. A copy of his book was obtained from Chinese sources
by The Associated Press in Hong Kong.
   It focuses on a critical military campaign of China's civil war:
the battle for Manchuria in 1945-48, won by the Communists.
   After Japan's defeat in World War II, China was thrown into
chaos. The anti-Japanese alliance between Mao Tse-tung's Communists
and Chiang's Nationalists collapsed and the two parties became
locked in civil war for control of the ``Middle Kingdom.''
   One of Zhang's most startling claims is that 150,000 civilians
starved to death between May and October 1948 during a battle for
Changchun, a key industrial center in the northeast.
   Communist Party doctrine holds that the battle was a bloodless
affair resulting in the surrender of 100,000 Nationalist troops
after a five-month siege by Communist forces.
   Zhang said the Communist army's decision to surround the city in
May 1948 was accompanied by an order prohibiting civilians from
leaving, in order to put maximum pressure on the Nationalists'
grain reserves.
   He cited a report from a People's Liberation Army officer filed
Sept. 9, 1948, saying Communist troops were shooting and beating
fleeing residents, who at times were seen ``throwing their babies
behind them in order to escape the city.''
   ``Not allowing the starving city residents to leave and sending
other starving citizens back into the city has become difficult to
explain to the troops,'' the officer's report says.
   The author quoted cables from other officers asking that the
army be allowed to save starving people. The requests were denied,
he wrote.
   At one point, thousands of residents were caught between the two
forces. All food in the city had been requisitioned by the
Nationalists and the Communists refused to let the civilians pass,
so they died there, slowly, the book says.
   ``Changchun was like Hiroshima,'' Zhang wrote. ``The casualties
were about the same. Hiroshima took nine seconds; Changchun took
five months.''
   His book says Communist troops smuggled large quantities of
opium during the civil war. The point is particularly interesting
because the Communists took a strong anti-dug stand in the war
years, calling opium a symbol of China's weakness.
   Britain forced territorial concessions from China during two
Opium Wars in the 19th century. Millions of Chinese, both elite and
laborers, were addicted.
   Part of the Communist success against Chiang was their ability
to portray themselves as opponents of a drug that made the nation
weak.
   Zhang identifies one drug-dealing army division as No. 28, based
at the Communists base camp, Yenan, in central China.
   Official party history identifies China's current vice
president, Wang Zhen, as the division's commander. Zhang does not
mention Wang's name.
   When division No. 28 came to the northeast in 1946 to aid in the
Manchurian campaign, he wrote, it ``was already quite rich, having
made its money dealing opium and silver.''
   ``Some old cadres said every time that division moved, their
vehicles were piled high with goods,'' Zhang said. ``They looked
like a baggage train.''
   Drug trafficking was widespread among Communist Party officials,
the book says, including some former generals who died as
``revolutionary heroes.''
   ``The phenomenon of getting rich was pretty common, among
individuals and groups, especially among front-line military
units,'' Zhang wrote. ``They did it moving yellow (gold), white
(silver) and black (opium).''
   ``White Snow, Red Blood'' breaks with Communist Party doctrine
by blaming the late Chairman Mao Tse-tung for major military
defeats and praising the traitor Lin Biao as a genius. Until
Zhang's book, Mao had been criticized only for ``mistakes'' made
after the victory in 1949.
   Lin, once Mao's heir, fell from grace after Sept. 13, 1971, when
he is believed to have died in an attempt to flee China after an
aborted coup d'etat. He commanded the Communist forces in
Manchuria, and Western scholars have credited him with leading the
Communist army to victory.
   Official party histories reject Lin's influence because any
praise would be interpreted as indirect approval of his later
attempts to seize power.
   Analyzing internal party documents, Zhang credits Lin with
avoiding a disastrous military defeat in the spring of 1946 by
withdrawing from the northeast town of Siping, which Mao had
ordered held at all costs.
   In Zhang's view, Lin's decision saved the Manchurian campaign.
   ``When it came to acumen in peace and war,'' he wrote, ``Lin was
wiser and deeper than Mao.''
   Other recent books published by China's military also have
probed the past of the People's Liberation Army.
   One called ``Black Snow'' argues that China should not have
entered the Korean War because the Soviet Union had a treaty with
North Korea and, therefore, the responsibility to protect it.
Communist doctrine says China's decision to cross the Yalu River
was a glorious one.
   These books are similar to the historical revisionism currently
under way in the Soviet Union.
   Between the time the Chinese books were written in the late
1980s and the time they were published, however, China's limited
political reforms became a casualty of the 1989 crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement.
   Nonetheless, their very appearance when hard-liners were
supposed to be cementing their control indicates that divisions
within the military.
   Although such high-ranking military officers as Gen. Yang
Baibing criticized the books, they did not stop their own
publishing houses from putting them out.
   The main struggle in the military is between conservatives like
Gen. Yang, who want to use the army to ensure the Communist Party's
continuance in power, and officers who want to remove the army from
politics and modernize it.
   Those in the latter category generally opposed the crackdown in
Tiananmen Square. They include writers like Zhang Zhenglu,
well-educated men who have little in common with the peasant
revolutionaries of 41 years ago.

<HEAD>Bush's Post-Election Prospects: Sure To Change Again and Again</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the revised political form charts,
President Bush's 1992 vulnerability rating has soared and Democrats
are surging toward a potent bid for the White House - appraisals
that will stand until the next revision.
   And it won't be long in coming. The only certainty about the new
look at Bush's reelection prospects is that it will be outdated by
events, issues and personalities before the real campaigning
begins.
   The outcome in Tuesday's elections won't have much to do with
it, for all the efforts of political cheerleaders and seers to
project the next campaign based on the last one.
   Not that Bush lacks for political problems. Those were
displayed, but not created by the off-year campaign and elections.
Chief among them: He had to surrender a major issue by agreeing to
increased taxes as part of the budget deal. Now he's trying to
revive his no-tax pledge with a no-more pledge.
   Taxes and budgets are going to be a political headache for
Democrats, too.
   They've all got to overn in a slumping economy that's going to
afflict state and federal budgets next year. Democrats said all
along that Bush would be hard to beat for a second term if the
economy is in good shape in 1992, and vulnerable to their challenge
if it isn't. Nothing has happened to change that appraisal.
   Nor can there be meaningful guesses about the next election
without an answer to the biggest question a president faces: war or
peace. With American troops on the front lines against Iraq, the
outcome in the Persian Gulf crisis could become the overwhelming
issue of 1992.
   Furthermore, off-year elections seldom have been a barometer of
the presidential contests that followed, even when they delivered
the kind of clear, partisan verdict that was lacking this time.
   Midterm election campaigns can set the candidate lineup for the
presidential year, but that doesn't necessarily work, either. It
didn't work for Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, the Democrats'
chosen spokesman in a nationally televised address on the eve of
the 1970 elections, a loser when he sought the 1972 presidential
nomination.
   Bush acknowledges his disappointment in the setbacks some
Republicans suffered on Tuesday, but dismisses ``this kind of coy
dance'' in which the off-year is weighed as sign of the campaign to
come.
   ``The minute the election is over everybody shifts gear and
starts pointing at '92,'' he said. ``It's understandable.'' He
turned aside questions about his plans to seek a second term,
saying he isn't thinking about the next election.
   That's standard positioning for a president, who doesn't have to
worry about campaign fundraising or about gaining his party's
nomination. Those advantages go with the job.
   A challenger has to start sooner, which means about now, January
at the latest. Democratic prospects already have waited longer than
usual to start stirring. When Bush was riding highest in the
approval polls, there were complaints that nobody seemed to want to
take him on.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, no longer ranked a presidential prospect
in the early polls and speculation, complained months ago at what
he called ``a kind of unnatural quiet coming from our party.''
   He said last spring that Democrats were ``almost conceding a
second term to President Bush - or hoping against hope that he
stumbles somewhere along the way.''
   Now that it's happened, largely on the tax reversal and economic
unease, Democratic leaders say Bush can be beaten. ``I think George
Bush is incredibly vulnerable in 1992,'' said Ronald H. Brown, the
Democratic Party chairman. Republicans, of course, insist that's
not so, and claim he could have won this time.
   That's hypothetical. Some of the problem points are not.
   Bush needs a clear, consistent theme, without the variations of
the past campaign. He campaigned against Democrats and taxes, then
against Washington in general, then against Saddam Hussein.
   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said shifts in the message were
``a phony issue'' because all the elements were there in every
speech. That's so, but the emphasis shifted drastically.
   White House political aides and advisors reportedly differed on
tactics and topics for the off-year campaign. Strains like that can
do serious damage in a presidential campaign, and the Bush
reelection committee - expected to open up next fall - will need
strong management.
   Conservative Republicans are restive, especially on taxes, and
there is talk of a challenge from the right in the Republican
primaries in 1992. That may be chronic: Bush never has been a
favorite of the GOP right.

<HEAD>AIDS Drug Mired in Corruption and Controversy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A low-cost drug Kenya trumpeted as a
breakthrough AIDS treatment has become mired in licensing squabbles
and corruption charges, delaying its availability and casting doubt
on promising initial findings.
   Patients and doctors who have used the drug, known as Kemron,
say it does seem to alleviate symptoms. And people are coming from
Europe, the United States and elsewhere to try it.
   The optimistic reports await confirmation in clinical trials
under way in several countries. Doubtful claims of proprietorship
by Kenyan researchers and suggestions they may have overstated
their findings have cast doubt on the reports.
   There also are accusations that one Kenyan doctor has sold test
samples of Kemron, including worthless placebos, for exorbitant
prices.
   ``Somebody's been corrupted if they're selling placebos to dying
AIDS patients,'' said Joseph Cummins, an American veterinarian who
supplied the interferon that comprises the treatment.
   Interferons, which long have been studied for antiviral
properties, occur naturally in the body and help shield the immune
system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use
of interferons in treating Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer common among
people with AIDS.
   Cummins devised a method of administering low doses of
interferon that is being used by doctors at the Kenya Medical
Research Institute, which is known as Kemri.
   The drug generally has not been tested in pill form because of
the belief it would be destroyed by stomach acid. In Cummins' use,
a tablet containing the drug is dissolved on the tongue, allowing
small doses to be absorbed through the mouth.
   Kenyan researchers who used Cummins' method announced startling
findings in February. They said that after two to four weeks of
treatment with Kemron, AIDS symptoms were alleviated in most of 101
patients tested. They claimed the virus that causes AIDS could no
longer be detected in the blood of about 10 percent of the
patients. The researchers reported no negative side effects.
   No other scientists have duplicated Kenya's findings, which
resulted from uncontrolled trials; no group received placebos for
comparison.
   But the World Health Organization, largely due to the Kenyan
results, has recommended worldwide trials while cautioning that
patients sometimes respond well to new treatments simply because of
the greater attention they receive.
   In announcing the unverified results, Kemri's director, Dr.
Davey Koech, claimed to have been largely responsible for
developing the treatment - a contention dismissed by Cummins.
   Koech said in February that Kemri produced ``a form of
interferon not so far described in medical literature.''
   As collaborators he cited Cummins, whose Amarillo Cell Culture
Institute has four patents on the low-dose use of oral interferon,
and Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories of Akayama, Japan.
Hayashibara is one of the few companies in the world that
manufactures interferons and produces the drug used in Kenya's
program under a licensing agreement with Cummins' company.
   Soon after the February presentation, Cummins wrote Koech,
accusing him of lies and misrepresentations and threatening to sue
over Koech's attempts to patent the technique in Kenya.
   From Texas, Cummins said he developed the treatment after years
of experimenting with interferon on animal diseases, including cat
leukemia. Cat leukemia, like AIDS, suppresses the immune system. He
described one early experiment in a 1987 article in the British
medical journal Lancet.
   Despite their disagreement, Cummins described Koech as ``quite
bold and courageous.'' He said Koech's main contribution was to put
the treatment ``into people we never could have tested'' due to
restrictive U.S. laws.
   However, Cummins said the legacy of the Kenyan tests was ``an
awful lot of drama and not much data.''
   Koech declined repeated requests for an interview.
   Neither Cummins nor Koech claims Kemron is a cure for AIDS.
However, critics say false hopes were raised among many in Kenya by
Koech's claims that almost 10 percent of those he tested
``seroconverted,'' meaning traces of the disease were erased from
their blood, as well as by Kenya's announcement in July that the
drug would be widely available by mid-August.
   ``Saying seroconversion is just another way of saying they have
got a cure,'' said Joe Muriuki, 32, who has been on Kemron since
December.
   He said that within two weeks of taking Kemron, he felt better
and began gaining weight. His mouth sores, swollen glands,
diarrhea, fevers, itchy skin and sweating disappeared.
   However, Muriuki, who has been an adviser at a clinic for
sexually transmitted diseases since learning he had AIDS three
years ago, said publicity about Kemron led people to believe it
would prevent and cure AIDS. And that has led to a relapse into
unsafe sexual behavior, he said.
   He also cited frustration over the drug's continued
inavailability.
   Although 200,000 tablets were imported for the July
announcement, most of them remain with the local marketing agent
due to a licensing dispute.
   The government's chief pharmacist says the agent, Innovative
Therapeutics Ltd., cannot sell the drug unless 51 percent gh syrup. She
called a friend from Alcoholics
Anonymous for help, but she heard nothing of what her friend said.
   ``All I could think was there were two more bottles of
Robitussin in the cupboard,'' she said.
   Rose told her friend she was all right and hung up. Rose drank
the remaining bottles. Another friend took her to the hospital.
   The doctors said she was depressed. They suggested 30-day
outpatient treatment. They gave her pills. The pills didn't work,
Rose said.
   ``A week later I got into a fight with my husband and cut my
wrists,'' she said.
   The doctors gave her more anti-depressants. ``I took all of them
and I felt relief for the first time - and went to bed to die,''
Rose said.
   Her friend from AA found her and called 911. She was unconscious
and in convulsions. She was in intensive care for four days.
   Rose, a pseudonym she chose to protect her identity, is a
34-year-old executive whose third suicide attempt in as many months
nearly succeeded.
   She came from the hospital to Springbrook Institute in Newberg.
   After 16 days in residential treatment, her outlook changed.
   ``I truly felt that God intervened for me,'' said Rose, now
living as an outpatient in a nearby apartment.
   ``I have my spark back. I have hope. I have healthy fear, which
will keep me motivated. I care about other people and myself. I've
made a good start.''
   This is her second attempt at recovery. Her failure the first
time took her self-esteem to new lows.
   ``Coming here was real scary,'' she said. ``I felt defeated. I
couldn't even die.''
   Rose said she started drinking when she was 12, but didn't admit
she had a problem until she was in her mid-20s. She had a good job,
a house, a nice car. She had a supportive boss and good friends.
   ``Those last two years, I didn't have a crisis - and I was
miserable,'' she said. She had some blackouts and began to
recognize a pattern.
   ``We would go out for `happy hour' and have a few drinks,'' she
said. ``I don't know what they would do, but I would get a bottle
and go home.''
   She knew she needed something.
   ``I went back to church. I contacted family,'' she said. ``I
even joined a softball team.''

   If your best driving performance is in the
golf cart, you may be playing the game wrong: Two researchers say
you could do your circulatory system more good if you make the trip
on foot.
   Walking a course regularly helps lower cholesterol levels, and
therefore may decrease the risk of heart disease, the experts
concluded.
   ``We need to reassess the value of this sport,'' said the report
in the journal The Physician and Sportsmedicine.
   Researchers Edward A. Palank and Ernest H. Hargreaves Jr. of the
New Hampshire Heart Institute in Manchester looked at 28 average
but enthusiastic male golfers ages 48 to 80. They had not exercised
the previous four months.
   In the study, the golfers walked about 14 miles a week by
playing an 18-hole course an average of three times a week from
mid-May to mid-September of 1989 - with a pullcart or carrying a
light bag.
   The golfers lowered their total cholesterol by an average of 17
milligrams per deciliter of blood, the study said. The low-density
lipoprotein fraction of their cholesterol, the so-called ``bad''
cholesterol associated with higher risk of heart disease, fell by
an average of 13.2 milligrams, it said.
   Both are ``very significant'' decreases, the report said.
   However, the level of high-density lipoprotein - so-called
``good cholesterol,'' associated with a lower risk of heart
disease, did not change significantly, the report said.
   That's because a golfer's stops to hit the ball get in the way
of his workout, said Palank, a cardiologist. It takes a sustained
aerobic workout to improve HDL, he said in an interview.
   Just the same, the study demonstrates the sport has health
value.
   ``If you play golf and you walk, and you take advantage of a
sport you like, you can improve your (heart disease) risk ratio,''
he said. ``The thing that's discouraging is that they've taken a
very enjoyable sport that was designed to walk, and taken out some
of the enjoyment and taken away some of the positive medical
benefit.''
   Palank blamed economics, saying courses make more money by
shuttling more golfers through on carts.
   Thirty-three percent of members-only courses, 29 percent of
daily fee courses and 11 percent of public courses require carts
some or all of the time, according to the National Golf Foundation
in Florida. The majority of courses require no carts and may not
even have them, said Andrew M. Snook, a research associate with the
non-profit organization.
   In a separate survey, done in 1988, golfers said they used a
cart about a third of the time they played, Snook said.
   However, walking may strengthen a golfers' game by reducing the
effects of fatigue, said Rob Mottram, a physical therapist with
Centinela Hospital, Inglewood, Calif. Mottram staffs a fitness
center, including weight machines, treadmlls and ultrasound
therapeutic equipment, which travels with professional golf tours.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Sugar Before Lunch Won't Spoil Kids' Appetites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Drinking a sugary drink before lunch may not be as bad for
children as parents assume, a researcher says.
   In a recent study, children ate less food for lunch if they
drank a sugared drink, but selected fewer cookies and soft drinks
and more cold cuts, bread and other foods than children who did not
have sugar beforehand.
   ``The study shows there's not an unlimited appetite for sugar.
The body becomes satisfied,'' said Harvey Anderson, chairman of the
nutrition department at the University of Toronto School of
Medicine.
   ``The more calories the children ate before lunch, the less
calories they ate at lunch,'' even though they were allowed to eat
as much as they wanted, said Anderson, who presented the study at a
symposium on nutrition research last month in Toronto. The research
has yet to be published.
   It is more important to consider what a child eats over the
course of a whole day than for one meal, said Dr. Ronald Kleinman
of Massachusetts General Hospital, who is chairman of the committee
on nutrition for the American Academy of Pediatrics.
   ``There's not very much information about whether having a snack
during the day, an hour or two before a meal, really makes a
difference in what somebody eats in their meal,'' said Kleinman,
who said he was not familiar with Anderson's study.
   There is a need, however, for research into children's eating
patterns, he said.
   Some studies have shown benefits of afternoon snacks for
children who play sports. Several also have been conducted on the
effects of breakfast on performance in schools, with contradictory
results, Kleinman said.
   Anderson and his colleagues studied normal-weight children, 10
boys and 10 girls, ages 9 and 10. At 11:30 a.m, the children were
given either 8 ounces of unsweetened Kool-Aid, or the drink
sweetened with 1.5 ounces or 3 ounces of sugar.
   Each child was his or her own control in the research, depending
on which drink was given on a particular day.
   ``We then sent the kids to `heaven' at 12 noon by giving them a
choice of all the cookies they could eat, all the pop, cake. We
also gave them bread, cold cuts, fruit and milk - the range of
foods, but all in excess,'' Anderson said.
   Children who had the sugared drink ate almost no sweets at
lunch, he said. Those who had the drink without sugar chose a
quarter of their lunch calories from cookies and soft drinks,
Anderson said.
   The children ate about 900 calories, including any calories in
the soft drink, Anderson said.
   The researchers wanted to know whether children respond to
calories in sugar, a simple carbohydrate. Anderson said there is no
published research on whether the same results would be achieved by
a complex carbohydrate, such as a banana.
   Anderson hopes to look at whether children who have a tendency
toward obesity also reach a satiation point with sugar. ``Are they
responding in the same way physiologically in terms of sugar
load?''
   Anderson said he is not recommending that parents give children
sugar before meals, ``though it is encouraging for parents that a
little sugar will do no harm'' to normal children.
   In addition to eating and drinking, the children in Anderson's
study played during the research. They were not told what was being
studied.
   Anderson said the children did not react against drinking
unsweetened Kool-Aid. ``They'd just drink it down quickly - they
wanted to get on and play,'' he said.

   Oil prices shot up nearly $3 per barrel after
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher warned that war could be
near in the Persian Gulf.
   The surge Wednesday gained momentum when a confidante of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said the countdown for
confrontation had begun, resurrecting anxiety among oil traders
that the flow of petroleum supplies would face disruptions.
   Traders were also responding to reports that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III had given Iraqi President Saddam Hussein an
ultimatum for vacating Kuwait, though Baker denied the reports.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The new heads of Infotechnology Inc., the
troubled parent of Financial News Network and United Press
International, say they would recommend selling the companies'
principal operations.
   Alan J. Hirschfield and Allan R. Tessler, appointed co-chief
executives in a management shakeup on Oct. 24, said Wednesday they
have retained the investment banking firm Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co.
for the negotiations and hope to conclude sales contracts by the
end of the year.
   United Press International had already said it was seeking a
buyer, but said it would have to liquidate if members of the Wire
Service Guild reject its proposal to cut wages by 35 percent for 90
days.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Food and Drug Administration has banned
223 ingredients in over-the-counter drugs, saying manufacturers had
offered no proof they were effective for problems they were
supposed to treat.
   The ingredients ranged from pine tar in dandruff fighters
through dehydrated garlic in digestive aids to aspirin in
medications for external use, it was announced Wednesday.
   The FDA did not ban the ingredients entirely, just in certain
uses. For example, aspirin may still be used in products for pain
relief taken internally, because it has been shown to be effective
pain reliever.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's farm population dipped again last
year, but more people than ever were living in small towns, distant
suburbs and the rest of rural America, the government reported.
   Farm people declined by 150,000 to an estimated 4,801,000 in
1989, a decrease described by Wednesday's report as ``not a
statistically significant difference'' from 1988. The new estimate
put the farm population at 1.9 percent of the U.S. total of more
than 248.2 million people, the smallest share on record.

   NEW YORK (AP) - CBS Inc. shares edged higher amid speculation
over whether executors of William S. Paley's estate will decide to
sell the late CBS Inc. chairman's 8 percent stake in the media
company.
   But CBS executives and media analysts Wednesday said even if the
stock were sold, chances were slim it could lead to an unfriendly
bid for control of the company, a frequent subject of takeover
rumors. The Wall Street Journal reported a sale of the stock seems
likely, partly because the Paley estate, valued at about $500
million, must raise $190 million to cover tax obligations.

   PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) - CF&amp;I Steel Corp. and nine subsidiaries
filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code.

reorganization.
   CF&amp;I, baseed in Pueblo, is a major producer of steel products

   SEATTLE (AP) - A Seattle-based seafood company has sued Exxon
Corp. in Washington state courts for loss of business stemming from
the 11 million gallon oil spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   The suit also names Exxon Shipping Co. and seeks an unspecified
amount of damages due to the spill caused when the tanker Exxon
Valdez hit a reef on March 24, 1989.

   BEIJING (AP) - Premier Li Peng has indicated willingness to give
foreign companies a role in developing China's most-promising
oilfield, so far closed to foreign involvement.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday Li made the
statement during a meeting with the president of Japan's Mitsubishi
Corp., Shinroku Morohashi.
   Morohashi specifically mentioned the Tarim Basin in northwestern
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, saying Mitsubishi ``is
ready to participate'' in oil development there, Xinhua said.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission says it had
cleared the proposed alliance between the automobile companies
Volvo of Sweden and Renault of France.
   The Commission said Wednesday the merger between Volvo and
Renault in markets for cars, trucks, and buses, would not create or
strengthen a dominant position in any of the markets.

   The stock market suffered a sharp setback Wednesday in selling
attributed to rising oil prices and fears of war in the Middle
East. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 44.31 to
2,440.84.
   Bonds fell sharply.
   The dollar ended moderately lower against most currencies in
volatile trading, bouncing off early-day lows with a buying spurt
prompted by Middle East saber-rattling. Gold prices were mixed.

   Another Battle of Britain is raging but it's not
about warplane dominance over the skies. This fight concerns
jetliner space on the ground.
   United Airlines' bid to fly into Heathrow, announced last month,
is expected to intensify the struggle for landing spots at one of
the world's busiest airports.
   The competition over which airlines can fly to Heathrow is
likely to be raised between the U.S. and British governments, which
are currently reviewing their air services agreement, the British
Department of Transport said.
   When United announced Oct. 23 it had purchased most of Pan
American World Airways' British air routes for $400 million, the
buyer asserted Pan Am's slot at Heathrow was part of the deal.
   But since 1977, the British government has barred any new
airline from entering crowded Heathrow, and might force United to
fly into Gatwick and other British airports.
   American Airlines was told to go to Gatwick when it bought Trans
World Airlines' Chicago-Heathrow route in a $195 million deal last
year.
   ``We certainly don't think they (United) have the right to
operate out of Heathrow,'' said Lizann Peppard, an American
Airlines spokeswoman in London.
   American has indicated an interest in buying the Pan Am routes
at a higher price than United is paying, but Pan Am and United say
their deal is sealed.
   Many international and domestic airlines want slots at Heathrow,
which is 20 miles west of London and served by the London subway
system. Gatwick, 27 miles south of London, links up with the
British Rail train network.
   Heathrow has more shops, restaurants and other amenities, and
offers far more connecting flights than Gatwick, primarily a center
for charter flights.
   British Midland Airways, Britain's second largest airline after
British Airways, wants more Heathrow slots and is lobbying for a
Heathrow expansion. Virgin Atlantic Airways, which operates out of
Gatwick, also wants to get into Heathrow.
   ``We certainly have ambitions ourselves to get into Heathrow and
it would obviously be unacceptable for U.S. carrier flying into
Heathrow and ourselves not,'' said Ed Hullah, Virgin's director for
commercial operations.
   But Lawrence Nagin, senior vice president for United Airlines,
said U.S.-British air services agreement allows successors to the
two specified American carriers operating out of Heathrow - Pan Am
and TWA - to assume their rights.
   United has filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation
asking for approval of transfer of rights. It has asked for an
expedited review, and a decision by Dec. 31.
   ``We're optimistic that the United States government will be
successful to get the U.K. government to approve United Airlines'
operations in Heathrow,'' Nagin said in a telephone interview from
Chicago.
   United wants to start operating the Pan Am routes in the spring.
They are from New York, Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and
Seattle.
   Pan Am is retaining London routes from Miami and Detroit but is
moving those flights to Gatwick.
   As a result of the United controversy, Britain's Department of
Transportation has asked the Civil Aviation Authority to accelerate
an existing review of the ``traffic distribution rules'' governing
the allocation of landing slots at Heathrow and Gatwick and to
report to the department early in the new year rather than in
March.
   The rules, separate from the U.S.-British air treaty, are
intended to relieve Heathrow congestion and spur growth at Gatwick.
   The department must wait to hear from the aviation authority
``before we can decide how to deal with the (United) application,''
said a department official interviewed on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. and British government officials already had agreed to meet
sometime this month for a second round of air services
liberalization talks, the official said, and it seemed likely the
United issue would be raised.
   Talks began more than a year ago on a new British-U.S. air
services agreement to replace the existing treaty reahed in the
mid-1970s.
   About 42 million passengers, 82 percent of them international,
passed through Heathrow last year, making it one of the world's
busiest air terminals. Gatwick handled 21.2 million. Heathrow is
served by 70 airlines although British Airways dominates.

   Pan Am Corp., which has agreed to sell some of
its key London routes, will increase service in Miami with more
flights to Latin America.
   Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said Wednesday an increased number
of departures out of Miami and into Latin America by Pan American
World Airways and Pan Am Express is part of an overall strategy for
the airline and fits in with plans unveiled in October to sell
important U.S-London routes to UAL Corp. for $400 million.
   Pan Am agreed to sell those coveted London routes to UAL, which
will join Pan Am in a marketing strategy intended to bolster Pan
Am's Latin American routes. The two airlines will coordinate some
flights in an effort to feed each other passengers.
   Pan Am said Wednesday it would be increasing daily flights out
of Miami during the winter season by 70 percent, from 63 last year
to 107 this year.
   Included in the expansion will be more nonstops from Miami to
Sao Paulo, Brazil, and new flights between Miami and Recife,
Brazil.
   Pan Am also will operate new services from Miami to Managua,
Nicaragua; San Salvador, El Salvador; Belize City, Belize; and San
Pedro Sula, Honduras.
   Service to other destinations in Latin America and the United
States will become more frequent.
   ``The broad-based cooperative agreement that we have signed with
United Airlines will allow us to focus even more of our attention
on our Florida and Latin American services,'' Plaskett said in a
statement.
   Analysts viewed the deal with UAL as a desperate cash-raising
attempt by Pan Am, which has lost money for years and like other
airlines has been hit hard by rising fuel costs.
   AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, called the $400 million
price too low and said it would pay in excess of $500 million for
the London routes. Plaskett has dismissed that offer, saying the
deal with United involves more than just the sale of the
trans-Atlantic routes.

   Would Wall Street's powerful investment banks
have the same clout if the address on their stationery were Jersey
City, N.J., or Stamford, Conn.?
   Municipal, political and business forces are circling their
wagons to head off major departures from the city where stocks
first were traded nearly 200 years ago.
   The bureaucrats won a battle Tuesday when four commodity
exchanges decided to stay in lower Manhattan rather than cross the
Hudson River to New Jersey, swayed by a $145 million incentives
package that includes free space.
   Now officials are turning their sights to Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,
a top-line investment bank with more than 4,000 employees, which is
considering moving about an hour north to Stamford when the firm's
leases expire in 1998.
   ``Do they want to be all alone in a glass jungle in Stamford?''
said Harold Holzer, a spokesman for Vincent Tese, the state's
director of economic development, who helped negotiate the deal to
keep the commodity exchanges.
   ``We're going to tell them it's going to hurt their competitive
position,'' Holzer said Wednesday. ``It's ot the world business
center.''
   Other firms have relocated trading-related support facilities to
cheaper space off Manhattan island, but Morgan would be the first
investment house to move its headquarters outside the city. In
fact, executives couldn't name a major New York law firm, brokerage
house or consulting firm that has fled the nation's financial hub.
   But during a prolonged securities industry recession, in a city
facing a $2 billion budget deficit, with layoffs rising, there's a
whiff of panic in the air over a possible domino effect of
departures.
   The New York City Partnership, a group of business and civic
leaders, sponsored a breakfast for Morgan on Tuesday. Stamford was
bashed and pressure was applied by luminaries such as New York Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Cardinal John O'Connor and former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
   ``What great ideas of civilization were ever spawned in the
suburbs?'' prominent attorney Arthur Liman asked. Said Moynihan:
``We live in a brutal capitalist system and if you leave New York
you die.''
   Stamford is undertaking its own campaign. The city of 105,000
paid for a 16-page advertising insert in The Wall Street Journal on
Monday touting its virtues - easy access to New York, suburban
living, good schools, 3 million square feet of empty office space,
no wage taxes, yacht marinas.
   ``We don't want to see New York fail but, that said, you can't
have it all,'' said David E. Anderson, president of The Stamford
Partnership. ``We can balance and contrast and have certain
strengths that New York can never have.''
   To be sure, not all Wall Street firms are considering abandoning
New York, but staying can be costly. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., for example, moved into extravagant
offices during the roaring mid-1980s, but have been forced to lay
off thousands as business has declined.
   Several major firms have moved or plan to move back-office
operations outside Manhattan, including Merrill, PaineWebber Inc.
and Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc. - all to New Jersey.
   First Boston Inc. has hired a major real estate firm to
investigate its options when leases expire at the end of 1993.
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. recently hired an executive who
engineered PaineWebber's New Jersey move; its back-office leases
expire in 1994.
   Cost is the top consideration. Firms also cite negative quality
of life issues in Manhattan such as education, crime, smelly
subways and homelessness.
   ``People will give you a list of a lot of items, but the main
thing that's driving them out of the city is economics,'' said John
Powers, senior managing director of Edward S. Gordon Co., a major
real estate firm.
   Real estate taxes in a first-class Manhattan building can hit $9
per square foot, compared with about $1.50 in the suburbs. On top
of that, commercial tenants pay a 6 percent occupancy tax based on
gross rent.
   Operating costs are $1 to $1.50 per square foot higher in New
York than in the outer lands, real estate executives said, while
construction costs range from 15 percent to 30 percent higher.
   ``If it were just money New York City would lose every time,''
said Lee Silberstein, vice president of the New York City Public
Development Corp. ``But there is a certain cache to doing business
in New York and there is a premium price that firms will pay to
stay here.''
   Grim times have eaten revenue for the city and state since the
1987 stock market crash, but officials say they won't negotiate out
of desperation. Despite the lucrative incentives for the commodity
exchanges, the city retains a growing industry of 11,700 workers
that generates $1.3 billion a year.

<TEXT>
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. is dropping
personal auto and homeowners' insurance in New Mexico and Idaho,
saying the business is unprofitable with little hope for much
improvement.
   Aetna stopped selling new auto and homeowners' policies in New
Mexico and Idaho Nov. 2. Starting in February, the company will not
renew policies in New Mexico; in March it will not renew them in
Idaho.
   The decision is the latest move by Aetna to improve dreary
financial results in personal insurance lines nationwide. The
Hartford-based insurance giant had already dedicated itself to
writing less personal auto insurance.
   Aetna is not a major player in personal lines in either state.
The company's decision will affect 10,265 existing policies in New
Mexico - 5,603 auto and 4,662 homeowners' - which is about 1.5
percent of the market, said Aetna spokesman Sal Foti.
   In Idaho, it said 4,140 policies will be affected - 1,802 auto
and 2,338 homeowners. Idaho law will require Aetna to keep insuring
customers who cannot find coverage elsewhere, Foti said.
   Withdrawing from the business ``will allow us to devote our
resources to other states where the opportunity for profitable
results is better,'' Foti said.
   Aetna has also stopped writing new personal auto policies in
Rhode Island, and is challenging laws in Massachusetts that make it
very expensive for the company to withdraw from auto insurance
there.

<HEAD>Cairns Group Says EC Farm Proposal Unacceptable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 14-nation bloc of farm exporting
countries said Thursday that world trade talks may collapse unless
the European Community changes its proposal on cutting agriculture
subsidies.
   ``A negotiation which showed no movement away from the current
European Community offer would be totally unacceptable,'' said Neal
Blewett, chairman of the Cairns Group, which includes such large
farm exporters as Australia, Argentina and Canada.
   Blewett, Australia's foreign trade minister, called the EC
proposal for a 30 percent cut in agricultural subsidies over 10
years ``very disappointing.'' He said it has thrown talks to bring
down trade barriers worldwide into ``deep trouble.''
   But said his group was delaying a possible bid to postpone the
final round of the world trade talks, due to be held here next
month.
   The United States has also criticized the EC's proposed 30
percent cut in farm subsidies, calling it ``nadequate.''
   ``If they (the EC) come to the table with the attitude that this
is our final offer, `take it or leave it,' then that is not
acceptable,'' Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Myles Frechette
said Wednesday in Washington.
   Cairns Group officials met Thursday with top EC trade officials
to discuss their concerns about the EC farm proposal and the
imperiled state of the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
   They said they welcomed assurances from the top EC trade
official, Frans Andriessen, that the Community proposal was an
opening position, not a final offer. But they said they worried
that did not allow negotiators much room to offer deeper cuts.
   On Tuesday, the EC became the last major participant in the
Uruguay Round of trade talks to submit a proposal on agriculture.
   The EC proposed a 30 percent cut in subsidies for farmers over
10 years, beginning in 1986. Some cuts have already been made. The
EC proposal does not extend to export subsidies.
   The Cairns Group and the United States, want to cut subsidies to
farmers by as much as 75 percent along with a virtual elimination
of exporters subsidies.
   The gap between the EC and its main trade partners threatens to
combine with other stumbling blocs in the talks to torpedo the
Uruguay Round, a four-year effort of more than 100 nations to bring
down global trade barriers.
   ``Unless there is willingness (by the EC) to move from that
position, then there is no prospect of success in the agriculture
negotiations,'' Blewett told reporters.
   Agriculture is one of 15 trade sectors under discussion in the
Uruguay Round, which also includes clothing, telecommunications and
services such as banking.
   But Cairns Group and U.S. officials maintain agriculture is the
key to a settlement in other areas.
   Cairns Group officials said they will wait two weeks before
deciding whether to advocate delaying a final set of Uruguay Round
meetings, scheduled for early next month.
   Members of the Cairns Group, named for the Australian city where
it held its first meeting in 1986, are: Argentina, Australia,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Fiji, Hungary, Indonesia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay.

<DATELINE>DANBURY,Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., citing
federal budget cuts, says it will eliminate about 90 jobs early
next month, trimming its 920-person work force by about 10 percent.
   The layoffs of salaried workers likely will account for most of
the cutback, but some jobs will be cut through attrition, company
spokesman Tom Arconti said Wednesday.
   Arconti said the company will attempt to transfer some of those
dismissed to jobs in other business units of its parent company,
the Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft division of General Motors
Corp. Those units are in California and elsewhere around the
nation, he said.
   Hughes Danbury Optical Systems formerly was part of Perkin Elmer
Corp. It is best known as the prime contractor to the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration on the problem-plagued Hubble
Space Telescope.
   Arconti said the layoffs planned for early December are
unrelated to the telescope's problems, which were traced to
measuring instruments used to create its mirrors.
   Instead, he said the move stemmed from leaner NASA and
Department of Defense budgets, which provide much of the funding
for the company's programs. ``We're finding a lot of our programs
being stretched out and facing reduced funding,'' Arconti said.

   The European Community's Executive
Commission said Thursday it had dropped charges alleging that
Ireland violated the community's law by allowing a public telephone
monopoly to continue in the country.
   In a statement, the Commission said that since July the Irish
government has abolished Telecom Eirann's monopoly of the market.
Private competitors can now compete ``on an equal footing,'' it
said.
   But the Commission said it would continue to monitor the
telecommunications markets in other European Community countries.
It said a similar infringement proceeding against Denmark had been

   In May 1988, the Commission ordered member states to withdraw

<TEXT>
   Z-Nix Co., a personal computer supplier,
filed a $4.5 million lawsuit against software giant Microsoft Corp.
alleging restraint of trade and breach of contract.
   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, says Microsoft
agreed to license its popular Windows software to Z-Nix for $27.50
a copy.
   Microsoft allegedly sought to double the fee when Z-Nix wanted
to pair Windows with a device it produces that points out material
on computer screens, Z-Nix says.
   The fee increase effectively priced the Z-Nix product out of the
market, Z-Nix contends.
   ``It's time for us to stand up to Microsoft's unfair trade
practices and stop the slow death of innovation in the industry,''
said Thomas T. Chan, attorney for Z-Nix.
   A spokesman for Microsoft said the Redmond, Wash.-based firm had
no comment Wednesday on the suit.
   Microsoft owns one of the most popular personal computer
operating systems, MS-DOS.
   Windows, released earlier this year, is a popular software
program that doubles as an operating system. It has forced other
software publishers to quickly devise programs that work with it.

   The stock market was little changed today,
levelling off after Wednesday's broad decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.19 to 2,434.65
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a slight edge on losers in the early tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 451 up, 431 down and 502
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.82 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates held steady in the government bond market pending
the completion today of a three-day quarterly auction of Treasury
securities.
   Analysts said investors remained hopeful that the Federal
Reserve would take further steps before long to relax its credit
policy.
   One assumed precondition for a more stimulative Fed policy is a
reduction in inflationary pressures, especially in oil prices.
   A bit of encouragement on that score is expected Friday when the
Labor Department reports on the producer price index of finished
goods for October.
   Analysts are projecting an increase in the index of between 0.5
percent and 1.0 percent, down from 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose &rsqb; to 48|; Philip
Morris was up &lsqb; at 48; General Electric dropped \ to 51}, and
Boeing was down \ at 44\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

value index was down .38 at 289.36.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 44.31 to

<HEAD>British Steel to Close Scottish Steelworks; 1,200 Jobs To Go</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Steel announced Thursday it would close a
Scottish steelworks early next year, resulting in the loss of 1,200
jobs in an area already hard-hit by the planned closure of another
large British Steel plant.
   British Steel said it had decided reluctantly it could no longer
support the losses at Clydesdale, which makes seamless steel tubes
for the oil and gas industry.
   A company spokesman said an oversupply of seamless tubes had
caused ``significant losses'' for the past six years at the two
tube mills in the Strathclyde area.
   The mills, built in 1948 and 1956, had become obsolete.
Together, they produce about a quarter of a million tons of
seamless pipes every year, mainly used in bore holes.
   Earlier this year, British Steel announced plans to cut 800 jobs
next spring at the Ravenscraig plant, also in Strathclyde.
Ravenscraig is a hot strip mill. The company said Thursday the
closures were unrelated.
   The company said it recognized the impact the closure decision
would have on the community and promised to offer counselling
services to retrain workers.
   British Steel added that the Clydesdale workers had known for
some time that processes at the plant were obsolete and faced
strong international competition.
   But Roy Evans, general secretary of the Iron and Steel Trades
Confederation, said the decision shocked workers.
   Evans said he had been told Clydesdale was losing about $34
million a year and the mills were in bad shape.
   ``There has been a failure to invest in Clydesdale over the
years because of the huge over-capacity of the seamless tube
product,'' Evans said. ``We knew there were problems but the
announcement of a complete closure has come as a shock.''
   Strathclyde, in western Scotland, is the traditional commercial
and industrial heartland of the country, containing nearly
one-quarter of the total population.

cited by the government as contributing to Greece's $100 billion
public debt.
   The legislation also entitles the state to sell off the Bank of
Crete, a former private bank that was nationalized after its owner
and chairman was accused of embezzling about $210 million.
   It also compels companies to have minimum equity capital of $3.3
million to enter the stock exchange, abolishing a system whereby
their shares were underwritten by banks for the first six months.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Mixed Ahead Of Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade in advance of a
government report that was expected to project a larger soybean
crop and a smaller corn crop than last month's report.
   The soybean market turned mostly lower after an opening rally
that was based in part on rumors the Soviet Union is in the market
for U.S. soybean meal. Similar rumors supported the soybean market
yesterday.
   Corn was slightly lower while wheat futures were modestly
higher, boosted by new sales of U.S. wheat to the Philippines. The
sales confirmed this morning brought the total amount of U.S. wheat
purchased this week by the Philippines to more than 500,000 metric
tons.
   Market-watchers expected prices to move within narrow ranges
today ahead of this afternoon's monthly Agriculture Department crop
report. A survey of private analysts yielded average production
projections of 1.84 billion bushels of soybeans compared with last
month's USDA estimate of 1.82 billion, and 7.98 billions bushels of
corn compared with last month's government projection of 8 billion.
   ``There's a real choppy attitude right now with rumors of export
business, the USDA report and fear of war in the Middle East,''
said William Biedermann, research director with Allendale Inc., a
commodities brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.65} a bushel; corn
was unchanged to { cent lower with December at $2.29} a bushel;
oats were unchanged to { cent lower with December at $1.21 a
bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
November at $5.82} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mostly lower and pork bellies were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .03 cent higher with December
at 77.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .25 cent
lower with November at 87.75 cents a pound; hogs were .55 cent
lower to .05 cent higher with December at 53.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .90 cent higher with
February at 69.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled narrowly mixed on Thursday. Pork
bellies rose sharply.

<HEAD>Christmas Outlook Worsens Amid Disappointing October Sales Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for the Christmas shopping season worsened today as
the nation's biggest retailers reported dismal sales results for
the month of October.
   Several companies, including J.C. Penney Co. Inc., May
Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc., reported their sales
dropped from year-earlier levels.
   The results, coming on the heels of poor showings in August and
September, ``reflected a recessionary psychology'' among consumers,
said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail industry analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co.
   ``We expect the weakness will continue,'' he said.
   Jeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.,
was equally downbeat, predicting, ``We're undoubtedly going to see
a continued winding down of the consumer'' into the Christmas
season.
   Consumers have put spending for discretionary items - clothing,
furniture and other extras - on hold the past few months because of
uncertainty over the economy and the fear of war in the Middle
East. They also have less money to spend because they are paying
more money for gasoline and heating oil.
   Analysts said consumers will be buying fewer and cheaper gifts
this year, shopping carefully and looking for bargains. With
merchandise not moving out of the stores the last few months, the
bargains are already there as retailers take markdowns in hopes of
reducing inventories.
   A poor Christmas is bad news for the economy, since two-thirds
of the gross national product is generated from consumer spending.
A bad season could also be devastating for retailers, who depend on
holiday shopping for about half their annual sales and profits.
   One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said its
sales at stores open at least a year fell 6.3 percent from October
1989, while overall sales dropped 4.9 percent.
   Analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year - also
known as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a more
accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall sales
do. New stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can
skew a retailer's results.
   Limited, the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
reported its comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall
sales rose 13 percent. Apparel stores were also affected by
continuing warm weather in some parts of the country.
   May, the parent of big department store chains including Lord &amp;
Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's, said comparable store sales
dropped 4.4 percent, while overall sales edged up 1.1 percent.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co., the country's largest retailer, said
comparable store sales fell 0.4 percent last month, while overall
sales dropped 1.2 percent.
   But Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continued to outperform the rest of the
retail industry, reporting comparable store sales rose 10 percent
while overall sales rose 25 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable store sales rose 4.1
percent, while overall sales picked up 16.7 percent.
   The results announced today differ from the monthly retail sales
report from the government. The Commerce Department includes sales
from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealerships in its figures.

   Rover Group's 31,000 hourly workers approved their new contract

   At Jaguar, 56 percent of the 9,000-member work force voted in
favor of a two-year deal that raises pay 12.5 percent this year and
either 7 percent or the rate of inflation next year, whichever is
greater.
   Jaguar, which was acquired by Ford last year, said average wages
now are 232 pounds, or $460, for a 39-hour work week.

<HEAD>Moon, Tides Seen By Oil Analysts As Keys To Invasion Date</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the investment advisers who earn a
living touting their picks on stocks and futures deals are now
trying their luck at handicapping the date war might break out in
the Persian Gulf.
   For example, anytime after midnight between Nov. 12 and Nov. 22
is ``the best time for an attack to occur,'' say Peter Beutel and
Thomas Blakeslee, oil analysts with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc.,
in Hoboken, N.J.
   They say their theories are rooted in military analyses coupled
with the lunar cycle.
   During the ``window'' for war picked by Beutel and Blakeslee,
the Kuwaiti tide will be high after midnight, which they say would
help commandos get closer to a potential beachhead, and the moon
phase will keep the sky dark, making it easier to storm the desert.
   After weeks in which financial markets were rocked by news and
rumors from the Gulf standoff, feelings that war was inevitable
perhaps inevitably led some experts to making picks on the startup
date.
   The picks have been gushing through the investing community,
with varying amounts of credibility.
   The Pegasus analysts, who offer advice on oil trading at the New
York Mercantile Exchange, have gone so far as to put their
predictions in writing. They call Nov. 12-22 ``a time to play any
short positions extremely closely. If there is any military action,
expect the U.S. to lead with its strong aerial suit.''
   They emphasize they're not predicting war, and don't want to
convey the impression that there's a sure-fire profiteering
opportunity. They are merely saying when and how they think war
would be most likely.
   Other wartime picks are not being made as boldly, and some
analysts say all of the guesswork is crazy, but they are cropping
up by the hundreds. Many analysts picked the days after the
elections on Tuesday, with some taking coming holidays into
account.
   ``Another theory one hears about is the weather factor,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. who emphasizes she is neither making nor touting any
picks for a likely day that the war can begin.
   ``There's a cloudy season that starts up, an overcast season in
February, that would make it difficult to stage an air strike,''
Hittle said.
   One stock market analyst has heard numerous Wall Streeters
picking precise days for the attack, say, this coming Sunday.
   ``If I talk to 47 people, I get 47 opinions,'' said Sara Cerato
of Nomura Securities International Inc. ``Each of these opinions
seems to be an excuse not to get into the (stock) market right now.
In the past, in a bull market, it paid to buy the market dips. Now,
it doesn't seem to be working. The war seems to be the latest
excuse'' to stay out.
   Early in the week, some oil traders were picking invasion days
between Wednesday, which came and went with no war, and Friday.
   A Las Vegas oddsmaker said it would be possible to handicap the
outset of war, just as people handicap anything else from football
games to movies that might win an Oscar. But don't count on any
Vegas sports books getting involved in war speculation.
   It's only legal for them to set odds on sporting events. Other
oddsmaking is done only for promotional and entertainment purposes.
   ``We put out odds on whether George Steinbrenner would be banned
from baseball,'' said oddsmaker Art Manteris of the Las Vegas
Hilton. ``We put out odds on whether Pete Rose would be admitted to
the Baseball Hall of Fame.''
   Manteris said handicapping war would be ``a business matter, not
an entertainment matter.''

<HEAD>Attorney General Rings Up No Sale on Trump Condo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump, already under heavy
pressure from his creditors, must prove he can cover the monthly
costs of his Trump Palace condominium before any more units are
sold, the state attorney general's office said Thursday.
   Trump must produce evidence he can cover the common charges,
real estate taxes and other obligations on the 57-story building at
69th Street and Third Avenue, said Richard Barr, a spokesman for
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   ``We've requested that information, and we're waiting to receive
it,'' Barr said.
   Abrams took the action after investors complained that Trump has
withheld information about his troubled finances since they
contracted to buy condominiums. State law requires condo developers
to reveal ``material changes'' in their finances which could
adversely affect people in the building.
   If Abrams finds Trump broke the law, the contracts could be
invalidated. Sales contracts have been signed on 77 of the
building's 283 condominiums.
   Trump, in an interview with The New York Times, said the
depressed Manhattan real estate market has buyers ``looking for any
method to break signed contracts.''
   ``This is happening at virtually every new development,'' Trump
said. ``And if the attorney general allows it, there will never be
another dime invested by developers or banks in New York real
estate.''

<HEAD>The Hartford, Aetna to Withdraw From Insurance Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ITT Hartford Insurance Group and Aetna
Life &amp; Casualty Co. said they plan to withdraw from various
insurance markets in three states.
   Aetna is dropping personal auto and homeowners' insurance in New
Mexico and Idaho, saying the business is unprofitable with little
hope for much improvement.
   The Hartford, meanwhile, said it plans to withdraw from most of
its personal auto insurance business in Michigan, after settling
disputes with regulators and insurance agents in that state.
   The Hartford, which writes only 0.2 percent of Michigan's
personal auto insurance, wants to withdraw because of financial
losses and regulatory restraints.
   Eight insurance agencies sued the company, saying The Hartford
would be violating their contracts by telling customers they could
apply for insurance from another subsidiary that sells directly,
not through agents.
   The agencies dropped the suit after the company agreed to make
certain payments to agents, said John C. Colpean, an attorney
assisting on the agents' suit.
   The Hartford plans to withdraw five of its companies - the ones
that sell through independent agents - from personal auto insurance
and ``umbrella'' liability in Michigan. Individuals buy umbrellas
to protect themselves from the costs of lawsuits.
   However, the company plans to continue selling auto insurance
through its Hartford Insurance Company of the Midwest, which
insures many members of the American Association of Retired Persons
without going through agents.
   Under an agreement with regulators, The Hartford will notify
customers that if they cannot find insurance elsewhere, they can
apply to The Hartford of the Midwest.
   The Hartford will stop renewing auto policies expiring in
December.
   Aetna, which stopped selling new auto and homeowners' policies
in New Mexico and Idaho Nov. 2, said it will not renew policies in
New Mexico starting next February and in Idaho in March.
   The decision is the latest by Aetna to improve dreary financial
results in personal insurance lines nationwide. The company had
already dedicated itself to writing less personal auto insurance.
   Aetna is not a major player in personal lines in either state.
The pullout will affect 10,265 existing policies in New Mexico,
only 1.5 percent of the market, said Aetna spokesman Sal Foti.
   In Idaho, 4,140 policies will be affected. Idaho law will
require Aetna to keep insuring customers who cannot find coverage
elsewhere, Foti said.
   Withdrawing from the business ``will allow us to devote our
resources to other states where the opportunity for profitable
results is better,'' Foti said.
   Aetna has stopped writing new personal auto policies in Rhode
Island, and is challenging laws in Massachusetts that make it
expensive for the company to withdraw from auto insurance there.

<HEAD>Low Bond Yields As Treasury Refinancing Concludes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell in
Thursday's auction to the lowest level in nine months as the
government concluded its biggest-ever, $34.25 billion quarterly
refunding.
   The average yield was 8.71 percent, down from 8.87 percent at
the last auction on Aug. 9.
   It was the lowest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 8.50 percent
on Feb. 8. The bonds will carry a coupon interest rate of 8}
percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $10,037.60.
   A total of $10.75 billion in bonds were sold out of bids
totaling $22.08 billion.
   The Treasury on Thursday also sold $12 billion in 161-day cash
management bills with an average discount rate of 7.08 percent.
   The discount rate understates the actual return to investors:
7.41 percent with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,683.40.
   The refunding included the sale of $12.6 billion in three-year
notes on Tuesday and $11.1 billion in 10-year notes on Wednesday.
   This quarter's refunding is $2 billion larger than the previous
record set last August.
   In announcing this week's auctions, Treasury Assistant Secretary
Jay Powell said the offering would be used to refund $23.5 billion
in privately-held notes maturing Nov. 15 and to raise about $10.73
billion in new cash.
   The notes and bonds are sold regularly during the large debt
auctions held four times a year to replenish the government's
coffers.
   In addition, the Treasury sold $9.8 billion each in three-month
and six-month bills at its weekly bill auction on Monday.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush soon will sign a farm bill that
will help put decisions on what to produce in the hands of farmers,
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Thursday.
   ``We've just gotten a pretty good farm bill that gives farmers
more flexibility to choose which crops they're going to plant so
they can take advantage of opportunities as they see them, not as
someone in Washington, D.C., sees them,'' he said.
   Yeutter's remarks were prepared for delivery to an annual
convention of the Future Farmers of America in Kansas City, Mo.
Copies of his talk were released here.
   The United States also is working in the Uruguay Round of talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ``to open up world
markets for America's farmers,'' he said. The ongoing negotiations
are in Geneva, Switzerland, and are scheduled to conclude Dec. 31.
   ``If we're successful in doing so, we're counting on you to beat
the pants off the competition, and all America is confident you
will,'' Yeutter told the FFA delegates.
   Yeutter also said young people ``hold the hope and the future of
our country'' by deciding what to do with their lives.
   Decisions about education, drugs, voting and other activities
``will determine not only your future but the course of things to
come for America and perhaps for the world,'' he said.
   Yeutter later told the National Association of Farm Broadcasters
that Bush ``believes, as I do, that it's a solid farm bill, one
which will support the most efficient, productive farmers in the
world: ours. Moreover, it's a far better bill than most American
farmers believe.''
   The so-called triple base feature of the farm bill gives farmers
the option of planting what they choose on 15 percent of their base
crop acreage, thus giving growers more leeway in making production
and marketing decisions, he said.
   Yeutter said the GATT talks, which are aimed at liberalizing
world trade, including agricultural products, are important to
farmers for the same reason that the farm bill is important to
them: income.
   ``In fact, it means a lot more than the farm bill does,'' he
said.
   Yeutter said the farm bill is aimed at keeping U.S. commodities
competitive in world markets. The GATT talks are directed at
reducing export subsidies and other trade-distorting policies.
   In the end, he said, American farmers would have greater access
to foreign markets.
   ``If we fail to gain access to these markets, or fail to be
competitive in them, our agricultural sector will suffer
tremendously,'' Yeutter said.
   For example, he added, in the 1980s the European Community went
from being a net grain importer to a net grain exporter. In 1976,
the community imported 30 million metric tons of wheat. In 1989,
the bloc exported more than 20 million tons.
   ``In the process, the United States lost a tremendous European
market,'' Yeutter said. ``Worse, this glut of European wheat
flooded the world market, driving wheat prices - and American farm
income - way, way down.''
   Yeutter added: ``Why? Because of market-distorting agriculture
supports and subsidies within the European Community. That's why
we're pushing so hard to get meaningful agricultural reform from
the other major trading nations, such as Japan and the European
Community.''

<HEAD>Hot Rodders Plan Crush Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It may not match the sweaty drama of a
heavyweight bout, but a hot rod group is wondering if its Bearfoot
can knock out a Volvo in a single crunch.
   Challenged by the Texas attorney general, the Swedish car
manufacturer this week pulled an advertisement that showed one of
its cars withstanding the attempts of a ``monster truck'' to crush
it.
   The company admitted the Volvo in the ad had been reinforced.
   Now the U.S. Hot Rod Association says it will ``conduct its own
independent, objective test'' Friday using Bearfoot, the truck used
in the ads.
   The association said the test would show ``if a Volvo can truly
withstand the grizzly power of Bearfoot's 1,000-pound tires.''
   Bob Austin, spokesman for Volvo Cars of North America, said the
Hot Rod Association had excellent publicists who are ``spotting an
opportunity to ride on the crest of a wave. ... I guess Volvo's
response is, we'll see how they stand up.''
   On Monday, Volvo agreed to make no unproven claims, run
corrective newspaper ads and pay Texas $316,250 in investigative
costs.
   Volvo admitted no wrongdoing, but William Hoover, senior vice
president of Volvo Cars of North America, agreed that consumers
``deserve better advertising.''
   The ad, filmed in Austin, appears to show a Volvo as the only
car left relatively intact after the monster truck runs over a line
of autos.
   Friday's stunt in the parking lot of the Spectrum sports arena
is part of the U.S. Hot Rod Camel Mud &amp; Monster Truck Racing Fall
Festival of Speed.

<HEAD>British Company Accepts Northern Telecom's Friendly Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   STC PLC, a British communications and information
systems company, has accepted a friendly takeover offer from
Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd., which values STC at $3.6 billion,
the companies said Thursday.
   Northern Telecom, which already owns 27.2 percent of STC, is
offering 327 pence, or $6.21, a share for the rest of the company,
or a total of about $2.6 billion.
   STC's shares closed Thursday at 312 pence, or $5.92, up 19
pence, or about 36 cents, from Wednesday.
   Northern Telecom's offer, which was expected, is conditional on
STC completing the sale of 80 percent of its computer subsidiary,
ICL, to the Japanese computer maker Fujitsu Ltd., expected to occur
Nov. 30.
   Paul Stern, Northern Telecom's president and chief executive
officer, said the combined operations and the close working
relations that have already been established between the two
companies ``represent an excellent platform for growth in our
international business in the future.''
   STC Chairman and Chief Executive Arthur Walsh said the merger
would make it easier for his company to establish a European-based
communications group. STC has been in talks with various companies
since July about establishing a European operation.
   When news of talks between STC and possible partners became
known, analysts said a merger would fit a pattern seen among STC's
European counterparts, which have been trying to streamline and
combine operations to cut costs and capital expenditure associated
with new product launches.
   At the time, some analysts said STC had a dim future if it
didn't merge. In the six months ended July 1, STC reported a 32
percent decline in pretax profit to 77.7 million pounds, or $147
million, from a year before.
   Following completion of the 700 million-pound, or $1.3 billion,
cash sale of ICL to Fujitsu, STC's principal activities will be the
development and suply of communications systems, software and
services.
   Northern Telecom acquired its 27.2 percent stake in STC in
October 1987 as part of its long-term strategy to increase its
presence in worldwide telecommunications equipment markets.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a leading credit-rating agency, said it
was concerned about the additional debt Northern Telecom would take
on through the STC takever. S&amp;P put the company's senior debt on
its ``creditwatch'' list for further evaluation.
   STC was owned by ITT Corp. until 1979.

   Share prices closed lower Thursday, as the market
found little inspiration from Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major's autumn statement on public spending.
   Major dashed the London market's hopes for interest rate cuts
when he said that interest rates would fall only when it was ``safe

   One trader said the initial reaction to the House of Commons
statement was neutral, and the market needed more time to digest
the remarks.

   The stock market turned in a mixed showing
today, struggling to rally after Wednesday's broad loss.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 44.31 points
Wednesday, dropped another 8.91 to 2,431.93 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 825 up, 608 down and
517 unchanged.
   Interest rates held steady in the government bond market pending
the completion today of a three-day quarterly auction of Treasury
securities.
   Analysts said investors remained hopeful that the Federal
Reserve would take further steps before long to relax its credit
policy.
   One assumed precondition for a more stimulative Fed policy is a
reduction in inflationary pressures, especially in oil prices.
   A bit of encouragement on that score is expected Friday when the
Labor Department reports on the producer price index of finished
goods for October.
   Analysts are projecting an increase in the index of between 0.5
percent and 1.0 percent, down from 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August.
   NCR jumped 7&lsqb; to 55&lsqb; and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped
| to 33. The Wall Street Journal reported that the two companies
were talking about combining their computer operations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .57 to 168.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .91 at 288.83.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise Ahead Of Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead of an eagerly
awaited government crop report amid signs that foreign demand for
U.S. grains is picking up.
   The corn and wheat markets posted the strongest gains on
indications that Spain bought 780,000 metric tons of U.S. corn and
on reports that the Agriculture Department targeted Brazil for
sales of 300,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices.
   The soybean market was supported by unconfirmed rumors that the
Soviet Union bought 200,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal,
analysts said.
   Export demand for U.S. crops, especially soybeans, has been weak
lately but foreign sales typically rise at this time of year after
the corn and soybean harvest ends.
   Analysts said the rally also reflected book-squaring by traders
ahead of the USDA's monthly crop report.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the USDA
raised it soybean harvest projection to 1.9 billion bushels from
1.82 billion and lowered its corn production estimate to 7.94
billion bushels from 8.02 billion.
   Analysts had expected the USDA to raise the soybean number to
about 1.84 billion bushels and to lower the corn estimate to about
7.98 billion bushels.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2{ cents to 3\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.69 a bushel; corn
was 1 cent to 2} cents higher with December at $2.33 a bushel; oats
were \ cent to { cent higher with December at $1.21{ a bushel;
soybeans were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with November at $5.83

   Construction workers topped the Canary Wharf Tower
on Thursday, but the developers face a tall order in filling the
loftiest structure in Britain.
   The Reichmanns, an extremely wealthy family of landowners based
in Canada, still are seeking tenants for nearly half the space in
the flagship project of the vast and troubled Docklands development
in east London, hampered by a slow economy and inconvenient
transportation.
   It is Europe's largest office complex and the biggest project
ever undertaken by the Reichmanns, who own a vast array of
commercial properties in North America, including swathes of prime
Manhattan real estate.
   ``I hope this marks the beginning of public acceptance for
Canary Wharf,'' said Charles Young, executive director of the
Reichmanns' Olympia and York company.
   Construction workers hoisted a steel pyramid cap, signed by
officials and festooned with flags, to the top of the skyscraper.
   Greenwich residents across the Thames River have complained
about the glass-tipped steel obelisk designed by architect Cesar
Pelli. Prince Charles, a frequent critic of postwar British
architecture, has said about Canary Wharf, ``I would go mad if I
had to work there.''
   At Thursday's ceremony, Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of
Trafalgar House PLC, which fabricated the tower's 27,500 metric
tons of steel, said: ``I think if Christopher Wren and Inigo Jones
were here today, they would rejoice at this achievement.''
   Wren was the architect of St. Paul's Cathedral, the dome that
once dominated the east London skyline. Jones, designer of the
Queen's House in Greenwich, introduced the Palladian style to
Britain.
   The 800-foot, 50-story Canary Wharf Tower surpassed the 600-foot
National Westminster Bank building, located near the Bank of
England in the City of London, or financial district.
   ``The topping off shows what you can do with a little
organization, a little will and a lot of effort,'' said Michael
Dennis, managing director of Olympia and York Canary Wharf Ltd.
   Dennis said the achievement should dispel skepticism which has
plagued the project in the past three years.
   Canary Wharf's final price is expected to cost 4 billion pounds
or $7.8 billion.
   Peter Marano, senior vice president for leasing at Olympia and
York Canary Wharf, said it will be about 10 months before tenants
start moving in, ``and we expect to be 75 to 80 percent leased by
next May or June.''
   But real estate experts say the 71-acre project is risky because
of its huge size and its hard-to-reach location.
   ``In the 10-year view it will be a profitable investment,'' said
Nan Rogers, a real estate analyst with the London investment firm
James Capel &amp; Co. ``In the meantime they're having a lot of trouble
getting tenants in because of the transportation.''
   It will be years before the area's Docklands Light Railway,
which can carry 4,000 people an hour, will be upgraded enough to
handle the flow of people who will work at Canary Wharf, she said.
   A collapse of London real estate market because of high interest
rates, now running at 14 percent, and a slowing economy, have
hampered the Docklands development.
   Questions were raised about Canary Wharf when the Reichmanns
announced in September that they planned to sell 20 percent of
their extensive U.S. properties. But Olympia and York officials
said the sale had nothing to do with the project and expressed
satisfaction with the progress on tenants and on long-term
financing.

<HEAD>Report: AT&amp;T, NCR Discuss Combining Computer Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and NCR Corp.
are discussing combining their computer businesses, according to a
report published Thursday. Both companies said they had no comment.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted individuals familiar with the
talks as saying they are uncertain what form the combination could
take and cautioned that nothing may come of the discussions. The
Journal did not identify its sources.
   The report said the companies have been holding discussions for
more than a month and have explored several scenarios.
   One would have AT&amp;T acquire NCR outright, the story said, while
another could involve a spinoff of AT&amp;T's computer business to NCR
with AT&amp;T taking an equity stake in the combined operation.
   The Journal said the first scenario seems more likely because
AT&amp;T has long coveted NCR, while a spinoff may be seen as a defeat
for the telecommunications powerhouse.
   AT&amp;T spokeman Walter Murphy said the company never comments on
such speculation. Spokeswoman Connie Olasz at NCR's heradquarters
in Dayton, Ohio, said her company also had no comment.
   Charles Nichols, an independent industry analyst who follows
AT&amp;T, said there have been reports for several years that the phone
company was interested in acquiring a computer company. NCR and
Unisys Corp. have been among the names mentioned, he said.
   An NCR-AT&amp;T computer venture would make sense because it would
combine AT&amp;T's strengths in networked computers and
telecommunications with NCR's strong customer base in the retail
industry, where such skills are needed, Nichols said.
   He said he believed the least likely scenario would be for AT&amp;T
to buy NCR outright. A more likely arrangement would be for the two
companies to enter into a joint computer venture, or for AT&amp;T to
buy a stake in NCR.
   AT&amp;T has cooperative ventures with several computer companies,
including Sun Microsystems Inc. AT&amp;T owns about 20 percent of Sun's
stock.
   AT&amp;T's computer business is small compared with industry
leaders. But it has achieved success in the past few years in
selling computers to the federal government. It also recently
landed several major commercial contracts, including one with
American Airlines, Nichols said.
   NCR, the nation's fifth largest computer company, launched a
major revamping of its computer line this fall under which it will
base all its machines on industry standards and Intel Corp.
microprocessors, getting rid of its proprietary computer lines.
   NCR also is a major maker of automated teller machines and cash
registers.
   AT&amp;T generates $36 billion in revenue annually overall, while
NCR had revenue of about $6 billion last year.

   Groupe Bull, France's state-owned computer maker
with extensive U.S. operations, said Thursday it would eliminate
more than 10 percent of its work force due to a ``crisis'' facing
the world computer industry.
   Bull said it would slash 5,000 jobs, including up to 1,000 in
Massachusetts where it has extensive operations and its U.S.
headquarters, and 250 in Phoenix.
   Bull also projected it would lose 2.88 billion francs, or about
$511 million, this year.
   The steps are part of a long-awaited reorganization that also
will include unspecified plant closings. Bull said the plan is
aimed at helping the company turn a profit by 1992.
   Bull said in a statement it was trying to refocus its resources
to ``confront the worldwide crisis facing the information systems
industry.''
   Growth in the industry has slowed in recent years from its
previous clip of 30 percent or more a year.
   Bull, which employs about 47,000 people worldwide, already laid
off 2,000 workers during 1989 and 3,000 more so far this year.
   Bull's U.S. operations include the former Honeywell computer
units as well as Zenith Data Systems Corp., a maker of personal
computers.
   Under a new corporate structure, Bull HN, the company's
U.S.-based subsidiary, will take control of all Groupe Bull
operations in the Far East. The company also plans to consolidate
its European operations outside of France.
   Analysts said Bull has been hurt by shifts in the marketplace.
Customers increasingly are demanding ``open'' computer systems that
allow machines from different companies to work together.
   Bull has moved into this market with computers based on the
popular Unix operating system, but profit margins for these
machines are smaller than on traditional proprietary models.
   As a result, Bull spokesman Edward Russell said, administrative
and sales costs have had to be cut.
   The company said it would implement an early retirement plan for
its U.S. workers. But it said the job reductions would include
layoffs.
   Bull plans to eliminate at least 20 percent of the 2,050 jobs at
its U.S. headquarters in Billerica, north of Boston. The company
also said it will cut its payroll at three other Massachusetts
facilities.
   Aside from the cuts in Massachusetts and Phoenix, the company
plans to eliminate 350 other jobs at field locations in the United
States.
   In addition, Bull plans to cut about 170 jobs at Zenith Data
Systems, which is based outside Chicago, and up to 100 jobs in
Canada.
   The company stressed that it also was investing in long-term
research to develop new products.
   This year, other computer companies, including Digital Equipment
Corp., Unisys Corp., Data General Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc.,
have reduced their payrolls, either through layoffs or voluntary
measures.
   In France, labor leaders said they would protest the cutbacks.
   Jean-Francois Bolzinger, an administrator of the leftist General
Confederation of Labor, said 1,100 of the jobs targeted for
elimination were in France. Bolzinger contended that Bull
overestimated its losses to create ``psychological shock'' among
the work force.
   On Oct. 25, Europe's largest electronics and computer company,
NV Philips of the Netherlands, announced plans to cut 45,000 jobs
from its worldwide payroll of 285,000.

<HEAD>Chrysler UAW Members Voting on Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ratification voting is under way for 63,000
Chrysler Corp. workers on a three-year contract with the United
Auto Workers union.
   The voting period opened Wednesday and results must be reported
to the UAW's headquarters in Detroit by Nov. 18. The union said it
would not issue partial results.
   Balloting at one of Chrysler's most profitable factories, a
minivan assembly plant in St. Louis, won't be held until Nov. 17,
however, a union official said Thursday.
   A special part of the UAW-Chrysler contract deals just with the
minivan plant, and officials said more time was needed to give
details to the workers. Under the special provision, workers would
change from two production shifts to three.
   Officials expect Chrysler workers nationwide to ratify the pact
and close the final chapter of this year's UAW-Big Three
negotiations.
   UAW contracts with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. were
ratified by ratios of better than 4-to-1. Terms of the Chrysler-UAW
contract are essentially the same as the contracts the union signed
last month with GM and Ford.
   In all, more than 450,000 active auto workers are covered by
UAW-negotiated agreements with the Big Three.
   The St. Louis factory is one of two Chrysler plants making one
of its most profitable vehicles. The other is in Windsor, Ontario.
   Chrysler, which as recently as the mid-1980s sold more minivans
than all other automakers combined, needs the extra supply to fight
off competitors eating away at its share of the popular segment of
the U.S. vehicle market.
   An increase in minivan sales also would prop up Chrysler's
slumping profits. Last week, the No. 3 automaker reported it lost
$214 million in the third quarter, and there has been speculation
among Wall Street analysts that the company may end 1990 in the
red.
   There are about 3,500 union members at the St. Louis II minivan
factory.
   ``We just got the (contract) highlights out to the people
today,'' Ray Ramsey, financial secretary of UAW Local 110 at the
St. Louis II plant, said Thursday. ``This weekend is just too short
a notice.''
   The contract would change scheduling at the plant from a
two-shift operation to three shifts in July 1991 with the company
having an option of adding two nine-hour shifts on Saturdays.
   Elsewhere, the voting process appeared to go smoothly.
   ``Most of the stewards say it's flying good down here,'' Richard
McDonaugh, president of UAW Local 1183 at Chrysler's Newark, Del.,
assembly plant, said Thursday. His local plans to vote next week.

<HEAD>Two States Seek To Bar `Junk Bond' Mutual Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in New York and Massachusetts took
legal action Thursday to bar the sale of two junk-bond mutual funds
that allegedly duped 270,000 investors, many of ``very modest
means,'' with tricky sales pitches.
   First Investors, a large mutual fund company targeted in the
suit, denied the charges, which included scripted and misleading
sales pitches by aggressive representatives seeking to sign up
investors in their own living rooms.
   The company said in a statement it ``will vigorously defend
itself and is confident it will prevail.''
   The action capped a 15-month undercover investigation by the two
states into what New York Attorney General Robert Abrams called
fraudulent selling techniques employed by two of the largest junk
funds in the mutual-fund industry.
   Abrams filed suit in State Supreme Court; Massachusetts
Secretary of State Michael Connolly filed an administrative
complaint and will conduct a hearing into the alleged fraud, which
dates back to 1985. Several other states are considering legal
action.
   The two Manhattan-based funds are First Investors Fund for
Income Inc., with assets of $971 million as of June 30, and First
Investors High Yield Fund Inc., which had assets of $640 million at
that time.
   An estimated 90 percent of those assets were in junk bonds, the
risky IOUs peddled by hundreds of companies for takeovers or
expansion during the 1980s. But over the past year the junk-bond
market has collapsed, making these investments worth much less.
   Named in the suit are First Investors Consolidated Corp. and its
subsidiaries First Investors Corp., and First Investors Management
Co., along with a number of executives.
   Abrams said in a press release that First Investors offered
false assurances that the funds were safe and that the bonds were
guaranteed at a high rate of return. Investors were unaware, he
contended, that ``they were going into the riskiest sector of the
bond market.''
   Abrams said the funds were sold ``primarily in people's homes by
aggressive salespeople using a prepared script which greatly
misrepresented the risks involved.
   ``They preyed upon investors who were unsophisticated ... Many
victims were of very modest means and could ill afford their
losses,'' he said.
   The funds offered an installment plan for as little as $50 a
month in an effort to ``entice investors with little or no
savings.''
   The undercover operation included investigators posing as
potential investors. Abrams said audiotape evidence of the sales
pitch and ``evidence of such salesperson-client interactions''
would be introduced in court.
   First Investors said in its statement that it has conducted
business ``according to the rules and guidelines set forth by
regulatory bodies.'' The company noted that the lawsuits are
limited to the sales of two of its 25 mutual funds.
   First Investors performed in the bottom 10 percent of junk-bond
funds in rate of total return, Abrams said. In the last 16 months,
the funds' net asset value has plummeted 35 percent.
   ``This lawsuit seeks to end the deceptive practices we uncovered
and to gain restitution for those defrauded,'' Abrams said.
   The suit also named David Grayson and Glenn O. Head, president
and chairman of the corporations, as well as Howard Froman and
Alvin Blumenfeld, senior vice president of First Investors Corp.
   New York and Massachusetts residents comprise more than 30
percent of the investors in both funds.

<HEAD>Former Memories Magazine Editor Named to Same Post at American
Health</HEAD>

   Reader's Digest Association Inc. said Thursday
that the former editor of Memories magazine, Carey Winfrey, has
been named editor in chief at its American Health magazine.
   Reader's Digest also named a new acting publisher for the
magazine.
   The new appointees replace a pair of magazine executives who
were holdovers from the period when American Health was controlled
by a group led by Owen Lipstein, its founder who sold American
Health for $29 million in February.
   ``We are making these changes as part of our ongoing development
of American Health,'' said Thomas M. Kenney, president of Reader's
Digest Magazine Publishing Group. ``We feel that American Health
has great potential.''
   The decade-old magazine had undergone some rocky moments in the
months before it was sold. Advertisers complained issues were often
sent late.
   Readers' Digest slashed the magazine's guaranteed circulation
rate base to 800,000 from 1 million shortly. American Health is
published 10 timesa a year.
   In a weak ad market, American Health has seen its advertising
pages plunge 41.3 percent to 328 pages through the first nine
months of this year, according to Publishers Information Bureau.
That compared with an average 3.3 percent decline through September
at the 172 magazines the bureau tracks.
   Kenney said the company's immediate plan was to stabilize the
magazine by building up its infrastructure and circulation base,
and then hoped to make it the premiere health magazine of the
1990s.
   The company also feels the magazine will complement its book
publishing efforts in the health field.
   Winfrey replaces Joel Gurin as editor in chief of American
Health. Reader's Digest named Greg Coleman to replace Sheila Wyle
temporarily as publisher of American Health while a secarch goes on
for a permanent replacement.
   Coleman is already group publisher of the Reader's Digest
Special Interest Magazine Group.
   The anouncement said only that Gurin and Ms. Wyle were leaving
their posts and calls to each of them were not returned. Gurin had
been with American Health since 1981 while Ms. Wyle joined the
magazine in 1983.
   Asked whether they were fired, Bruce Trachtenberg, a spokesman
for Reader's Digest, said, ``There was a meeting this morning. They
both met with Kenney and those were the results.''
   Winfrey, 49, has worked for 23 years in magazines, newspapers
and television.
   He had been a vice president at Hachette SA's Diamandis
Communications Inc., where he was founding editor in chief in 1988
of Memories magazine which took another look every other month at
important events of past decades.
   Hachette suspended regular publication of Memories two months
ago after efforts to sell it failed and the market for advertising
grew too weak to support it. Hachette plans to publish the magazine
twice a year.
   Before Memories, Winfrey was editor in chief of Cuisine
magazine, an associate editor at Time magazine, a reporter for the
New York Times and a producer for a cable television venture by CBS
Inc.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street
Journal, said Thursday it has formed a company with the German
business publisher Von Holtzbrinck Group to pursue English-language
publishing ventures in Europe.
   Von Holtzbrinck publishes Germany's leading business daily,
Handelsblatt.
   The new company, Handelsblatt-Dow Jones Gmbh, will have an
initial capitalization of $1 million and will be based in
Frankfurt.
   Its mission will be to develop joint advertising, circulation
and distribution arrangements between the Wall Street Journal
Europe and Handelsblatt in Europe, and explore English-language
publishing opportunities.
   Dow Jones and Von Holtzbrinck are equity partners in several
European enterprises, including France's Groupe Expansion and
Eurexpansion, a network of national-language business publications
in a dozen European countries.

   The stock market made little progress today in a
bid to rally after Wednesday's broad loss.
   Interest rates held steady in the government bond market through
the completion today of a three-day quarterly auction of Treasury
securities.
   Analysts said investors remained hopeful that the Federal
Reserve would take further steps before long to relax its credit
policy.
   One assumed precondition for a more stimulative Fed policy is a
reduction in inflationary pressures, especially in oil prices.
   A bit of encouragement on that score is expected Friday when the
Labor Department reports on the producer price index of finished
goods for October.
   Analysts are projecting an increase in the index of between 0.5
percent and 1.0 percent, down from 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August.

<HEAD>M&amp;M-Mars Introduces Peanut Butter M&amp;M</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN LEVIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   M&amp;M-Mars has introduced a peanut butter M&amp;M
to cash in on what analysts say is a booming demand for the
palate-clinging product.
   The newest version of the familiar M&amp;M consists of a creamy
peanut butter center covered by a layer of milk chocolate and
wrapped in the famous candy-coated outer shell.
   It can be bought only on the West Coast because of limited
production capacity, said Bill Deeter, a spokesman for M&amp;M-Mars, a
division of Mars Inc. He declined to predict when it would be
widely available.
   ``We're rolling it out as we have the capacity to supply,''
Deeter said in a telephone interview from his office in
Hackettstown, 35 miles west of Newark.
   Deeter denied that the popularity of Reese's Pieces - Hershey
Foods' peanut butter candy - had fueled M&amp;M-Mars' marketing
strategy.
   ``Mars makes up its mind based on where it sees its
opportunities and consumer appetites,'' Deeter said. ``This was the
logical next step for the product.''
   Industry analysts said the new product, which was rolled out in
September, underscores an insatiable appetite in the United States
for peanut butter.
   Earlier this year, M&amp;M-Mars added peanut butter to its popular
Snickers candy bar and also rolled out PB MAX, another peanut
butter confection that the industry sees as a competitor to Reese's
Peanut Butter Cups.
   ``Peanut butter sales are increasing in America,'' said
marketing consultant Phil Lempert of Montclair. He noted the
addition of chocolate chip and cinnamon raisin peanut butters on
the supermarket shelf next to creamy and crunchy styles.
   ``This is just one of a number of products that Mars has
introduced with peanut butter aimed at slowing down Reese's and
gaining a foothold in this growing category,'' said John McMillin,
a food industry analyst with Prudential Bache in New York.
   Hershey Foods' Reese's Cups are the second most popular candy in
the United States after M&amp;M-Mars' Snickers bars, analysts said.
   McMillin noted that the Reese's product line was boosted after
Reese's Pieces were used to lure a shy alien in the movie, ``E.T.:
the Extraterrestrial.''
   The sales gap between the top two candies, however, has been
narrowed considerably in the past few years, with Snickers bringing
in revenues of $129 million in 1989 compared with $105 million for
Reese's Cups, McMillin said.
   ``Snickers used to be way out in front,'' he said, ``and Mars
wants to maintain its lead.''
   Hershey, based in Hershey, Pa., controls about 44 percent of the
$5 billion chocolate candy market compared with Mars' 38 percent,
McMillin said.
   The peanut butter-enhanced M&amp;M - which marks the first new M&amp;M
flavor since the peanut variety was introduced in 1954 - will boost
an already successful product line.
   Peanut M&amp;Ms are the third best-selling candy in the United
States with $102 million in sales, followed by M&amp;Ms Plain, with $83
million in revenue, analysts said.
   Ironically, McMillin noted, M&amp;M-Mars chose to launch its new
peanut butter-heavy product line in the midst of a severe peanut
drought in Georgia that has driven up the price of peanuts.
   Deeter said the peanut drought would have little effect because
commodity buying is done ``years in advance.''

<HEAD>Bad October Sales Makes Gloomy Christmas For Retailers More Likely</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Kmart in 24th graf is cq, reflecting new style on company
name.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for the Christmas shopping season went from bad to
worse Thursday as the nation's biggest retailers reported dismal
sales results for the month of October.
   Several companies including Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and J.C. Penney
Co. Inc. said sales dropped from levels of a year earlier as
consumers, with one eye on the economy and the other on the Middle
East, avoided buying anything they didn't need.
   With Christmas less than seven weeks away, neither the retailers
nor the industry analysts who track their performance expect
consumers to suddenly shift gears and go on mammoth gift-buying
sprees.
   The 1990 holiday season will be ``a much more frugal
Christmas,'' predicted Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   ``They'll probaby be going in and buying the same number of
items, but they're not going to pay as much ...'' Tashjian said.
``They're not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their kids, not
this year.''
   The poor October sales, coming in the aftermath of disappointing
showings in August and September, ``reflected a recessionary
psychology'' among consumers, said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating
prices of gasoline andhome heating oil.
   The first items crossed off shopping lists were so-called
discretionary items - clothing, furniture and other extras that are
the bread and butter of many big stores.
   If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to
a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the
nation's economic growth is generated consumer spending.
   Unsold goods on store shelves could also affect manufacturing -
if stores don't place new orders, factories don't need to provide
as many products and could lay off workers.
   A poor Christmas season could be devastating for the retailers
themselves, as they depend on holiday shopping for about half their
annual sales and profits. Christmas 1989 was a disappointment for
many storeowners after they were forced to slash prices to attract
customers.
   Sears, the country's largest retailer, said results from stores
open at least one year fell 0.4 percent last month from October
1989, while overall sales dropped 1.2 percent.
   Analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year - also
known as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a more
accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall sales
do. New stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can
skew a retailer's results.
   One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said
comparable store sales fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while
overall sales dropped 4.9 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
reported comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall sales
rose 13 percent. Apparel stores were also affected by continuing
warm weather in some parts of the country.
   May Department Stores Co., parent of big department store chains
including Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's, said
comparable store sales dropped 4.4 percent, while overall sales
edged up 1.1 percent.
   But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers,
continued to outperform the rest of the retail industry, reporting
comparable store sales rose 10 percent while overall sales rose 25
percent.
   Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores,
especially those going into the Christmas season with high
inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are
expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see
their profits evaporate.
   Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen
one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be
marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When
one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow.
   Feiner, the Merrill Lynch analyst, noting that Christmas 1989
sales were hurt by markdowns, issued this warning about another
disappointing season: ``The end result ... could be further
bankruptcies and-or consolidations in the industry.''
   Several retailers, notably Federated Department Stores Inc. and
Allied Stores Corp., filed for bankruptcy court protection during
this past year.
   Among other reports from retailers Thursday:
   -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable store sales rose 4.1
percent, while overall sales picked up 16.7 percent.
   -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent sales gain at comparable
stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall.
   -Woolworth Corp. said comparable store sales increased 1
percent, while overall sales rose 4.2 percent.
   The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly retail
sales report from the government. The Commerce Department's figures
includes sales from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers.

<HEAD>Dollar Moves Sharply Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar staged a sharp advance on world
currency markets Thursday amid indications there is some
international support for a stronger U.S. currency.
   Gold prices rose, reversing a downward trend in Europe. On New
York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery
settled at $387.30 a troy ounce, up $1 from Wednesday. At Republic
National Bank, the late bid for gold was $387.15, up 45 cents an
ounce.
   The dollar got a boost from French Economics Minister Pierre
Beregovoy's disclosure that he had written to Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady recently asking for support in seeking coordinated
action to prop up the dollar.
   Beregovoy, who spoke at a news conference in Paris, said he
wants the so-called Group of Seven leading industrialized nations
to meet and address the issue.
   ``I don't think that the United States has an interest in the
sustained and accentuated decline of the dollar,'' he said.
   But U.S. and German officials denied that a G-7 meeting is
necessary, and that pushed the dollar temporarily lower in seesaw
domestic trading.
   ``The market is very nervous and is looking for any kind of
intervention by the central banks,'' said Bob Morrissey, a senior
trader at the Bank of Boston's office here.
   While it is widely accepted that the United States is satisfied
with the dollar's current trading range, a stronger dollar is
attractive to Europeans because it would make U.S. imports more
expensive for consumers overseas.
   Concern that tensions are heightening in the Persian Gulf region
also helped the dollar recover to its session highs, said John
McCarthy, chief dealer at Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. The
dollar is considered a safe haven in times of global turmoil.
   The dollar's biggest advance came against the Japanese yen,
which has been pushed lower because of overall disappointment with
the decline in the Japanese stock market and an uncertain political
climate.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 129.50 Japanese yen, from
127.55 yen at Wednesday's close. Later in London, it rose to 129.90
yen. In New York, the dollar jumped to close at 130.35 yen, from
128.73 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9670 from $1.9760 late
Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.9625 to buy one pound, less
expensive than Wednesday's $1.9690.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.4930 German marks, up from 1.4874;
1.2535 Swiss francs, up from 1.2485; 5.0100 French francs, up from
4.9870; 1,122.75 Italian lire, up from 1,117.00, and 1.1694
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1671.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's
rates included: 1.4885 German marks, up from 1.4820; 1.2580 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2435; 4.9935 French francs, up from 4.9715;
1.6780 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6712; 1,129.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,113.75, and 1.1685 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1627.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $385.75 a troy ounce, down
from $387.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to $384.75
an ounce from $386.75. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.67 an
ounce to close at $386.31.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.277 a troy ounce, up from $4.267
on Wednesday. But in London, the metal slipped to a late bid of
$4.25 a troy ounce from $4.28.

   The stock market posted a small gain Thursday
after several fitful attempts to rally from Wednesday's broad
decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 44.31 points
Wednesday, edged up 2.97 to 2,443.81.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
834 up, 654 down and 510 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 155.57 million
shares, up from 149.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 191.64 million shares.
   Interest rates held steady in the government bond market through
the completion of a three-day quarterly auction of Treasury
securities.
   Analysts said investors remained hopeful that the Federal
Reserve would take further steps before long to relax its credit
policy.
   One assumed precondition for a more stimulative Fed policy is a

   Analysts are projecting an increase in the index of between 0.5
percent and 1.0 percent, down from 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August.
   Stock prices changed direction several times during the session,
buffeted by rumors and speculation about the two-month-old showdown
in the Persian Gulf. Much of the furor died down at the close,
however, when President Bush announced only that he was sending
additional forces to the area.
   NCR jumped 5~ to 53~ and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph dropped
{ to 33&lsqb;. The Wall Street Journal reported that the two companies
were talking about combining their computer operations.
   Browning-Ferris Industries rose | to 22&rsqb; and Waste Management

   A former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. vice president
pleaded guilty Thursday to soliciting and demanding payoffs from
vendors hired to construct the brokerage firm's headquarters at the
World Financial Center.
   Albert Young, 61, of Manhattan, pleaded guilty to conspiracy,
mail fraud and two counts of tax fraud. He faces up to 18 years in
prison and a $1 million fine when sentenced Jan. 18 by U.S.
District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna of Manhattan.
   Authorities alleged that vendors supplied Young with a stretch
limousine and chauffeur and helped pay for his country home in
Hawley, Pa. Court papers said he also received a $2,900 silver fox
coat, use of a corporate credit card, furniture and cash payments.
   The complaint claimed Young received at least $350,000 in cash
and other benefits from contractors between 1984 and 1987 in return
for promises that they would get business with his employer.
   Young, a company vice president, resigned from the firm in
September 1988.
   One of the vendors, Marvin Weiner of Newark, N.J., also pleaded
guilty Thursday to a related charge of violating currency
regulations.
   Weiner, who owns Newark Food Service Equipment in New Jersey,
was accused of helping launder cash payoffs to Young in order to
avoid Internal Revenue Service reporting requirements.
   He faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced Jan. 7 by U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval.

<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and CS First Boston Inc. on
Thursday confirmed they were laying off about 100 more
professionals, extending the latest round of cutbacks on Wall
Street.
   Merrill Lynch said it laid off 50 investment bankers, bringing
the number of bankers the nation's biggest securities firm has cut
this year to 125. Merrill's investment banking force totals 575,
down 18 percent this year.
   First Boston, which reportedly may lay off up to 500 people by
the end of 1990, confirmed it dismissed 45 traders, salesmen and
support staff from its stock department. The firm earlier this week
fired 50 operations personnel.
   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. confirmed it laid off 10 investment bankers
of a staff of about 200. But the firm, considered one of the best
managed on Wall Street, also said it had hired five executives for
a new foreign stock trading department.
   Other firms also are expected to trim investment bankers.
   ``We're near a low in banking,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``I would think by
early next year most firms will have contracted to where they need
to be in banking.''
   Wall Street is stuck in a prolonged downturn dating to the
October 1987 stock market crash. The latest cuts of more than
45,000 since the crash involve highly paid professionals,
especially investment bankers who handled the large mergers and
takeovers of the 1980s.
   The value of U.S. mergers and acquisitions in the first 10
months of 1990 was down 50 percent compared with the same period
last year, according to IDD Information Services, a Wall Street
research and publishing concern.
   IDD said 3,575 deals valued at $185.9 billion were completed
from January through October, vs. 4,273 valued at $373.4 billion in
the same 1989 period. The drop was most severe in deals worth more
than $50 million.
   Also Thursday, the chairman of First Boston's merchant banking
department announced his resignation at the end of the year. The
departure of William E. Mayer comes after the firm's owners agreed
to purchase the bulk of a portfolio of bad loans that couldn't be
sold to investors.
   First Boston has been struggling this year to cope with
declining business across Wall Street and the collapse of the junk
bond market that left it holding more than $1 billion in loans to
clients that could not be resold and had severly hurt its balance
sheet.
   Mayer's departure was expected. In January, he was pushed aside
as chief executive of First Boston Corp., CS First Boston's U.S.
investment banking subsidiary and asked to take over a new merchant
banking unit.
   Mayer said in an interview that once the loan problems had been
resolved he decided to leave the firm. Mayer had been at First
Boston for 23 years.
   Mayer said his departure was not tied to the latest round of
layoffs. A First Boston spokesman said reports circulating at the
firm of 300 to 500 layoffs in the next two months were unfounded.

   Oil prices rallied in a wild session in the

hunch by traders that President Bush would increase military
pressure on Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   After the market closed, however, traders said they may have
overestimated the gravity of Bush's move.
   Crude oil dropped about $1 per barrel in early trading, but
finished the day with a 22 cent gain, closing at $35.53 per barrel
for December delivery contracts on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Bush told Washington reporters he was building up the U.S.
military force in the Persian Gulf to provide for ``an adequate
offensive option'' that could drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Administration officials had previously indicated they would
send more troops. Some traders said Thursday evening they had
perhaps overreacted to their nervousness over what Bush would say.
   ``I didn't hear anything new,'' said Brian Tagler, a broker with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``I think that the market definitely
pushed itself higher than (it would have on) what we know now.''
   Analysts said the market got scared in the afternoon when
traders learned a White House news conference on foreign policy,
originally scheduled to take place during the trading session, had
been delayed until after the exchange would be closed. Tension
built as traders learned the news conference was again delayed
until after the stock market's closing bell.
   Oil prices probably would have stayed lower for the day if Bush
had made his statements while trading was still going on, analysts
said.
   The sharp rally had been driven in part by a rumor, said to have
floated in from the bond market, that Bush had been prepared to
announce plans to airlift supplies into the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
where diplomats have been surviving for weeks on scanty provisions.
Traders believed such a scenario could provide the confrontation
that would trigger war in the Persian Gulf.
   Others put no faith in the rumor, saying it had cropped up
before.
   ``This is the second time I've heard it in a week,'' said trader
Ed Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``It's like the `Saddam
has been shot' rumors.''
   Some tense traders also believed Bush would give Iraq a deadline
for getting out of Kuwait, which Bush did not do.
   Oil prices also strengthened partly on news that the Soviet
Union was refusing to rule out the use of force against Iraq, which
has for years had close ties to Moscow.
   Other energy futures moved higher as traders waited on Bush, but
for the day they finished mixed.
   Home heating oil prices moved higher, with December delivery
contracts rising 1.59 cents to 94.30 cents a gallon and all later
contract months closing higher. Unleaded gasoline fell .68 cent to
90.51 on December delivery contracts, but later contract months
were all higher.
   Natural gas prices were either down or unchanged for the day.
December delivery contracts dropped 1.5 cents to $2.435 per 1,000
cubic feet.

<HEAD>Hearst Buys RJR Nabisco's 20 Percent Stake in ESPN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publishing and broadcasting powerhouse Hearst
Corp. has purchased the 20 percent stake that RJR Nabisco Inc. held
for seven years in the sports cable television service ESPN Inc.,
it was announced Thursday.
   Terms were not disclosed, but people familiar with the deal said
the price was less than $180 million.
   The deal forges another link between Hearst and Capital
Cities-ABC Inc., which owns 80 percent of ESPN and is Hearst's
partner in two other cable channels. ``It's a happy situation for
both of them,'' said media analyst John Reidy of Smith Barney
Harris Upham Inc.
   RJR Nabisco, the food and tobacco giant taken private last year
in the biggest debt-financed takeover on record, hired an
investment banker 15 months ago to help it decide whether to sell
the ESPN stake.
   Capital Cities-ABC had the right to match any offer for RJR's
interest in ESPN, but had little to gain from buying the minority
interest itself.
   Speculation quickly centered on Hearst as a potential buyer of
the ESPN stake. Hearst and Capital Cities-ABC have a long
association. They each have equity stakes in the Lifetime and Arts
&amp; Entertainmnet cable channels. Five of Hearst's six TV stations
are ABC network affiliates.
   In addition, Capital Cities-ABC was responsible for running the
operation under a shareholder agreement that left little to do for
the minority shareholder.
   ``It it were any other company than Capital Cities-ABC, Hearst
would not be nearly as interested,'' said Raymond E. Joslin, head
of the Hearst Entertainment and Syndication Group.
   He said Hearst hopes to benefit, however, from the maturation of
the cable television business and the prospect that cable TV
networks will soon be able to charge nearly as much for advertising
as broadcast networks.
   ESPN is is the largest cable TV programming service in the
United States with more than 57 million cable TV subscribers, or
about 60 percent of U.S. homes with television.
   It offers coverage of professional and amateur sports events as
well as sports news and lifestyle programs.
   Industry insiders said ESPN had operating income of about $135
million on revenues of $390 million in 1989. It is expected that
operating income will fall this year because of losses estimated at
about $30 million on the cable network's first year under a
four-year contract to cover major league baseball.
   While declining to comment on the financial figures, Joslin said
Hearst expects that ESPN will make a small profit over the life of
the baseball contract. The contract permits ESPN to carry 175
regular season games a year.
   RJR Nabisco, swallowed up in a $24.5 billion buyout by the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. in early 1989, sold
assets to trim its debt.
   Jason Wright, a spokesman for RJR, said the sale of the ESPN
stake was not required under any of the company's debt covenants,
but he said the company felt it should sell the stake because it
was outside its core business areas.
   He said no decision has been made yet on what will be done with
the proceeds of the sale. He said RJR's debt is expected to fall to
$20 billion by the end of the year, down from $28 billion at the
time of the buyout.
   He said there were ``numerous expressions of interest'' in the
ESPN stake, but declined to say how many companies made bids.
   The deal expands the cable television interests at Hearst, a
privately held company with major operations in magazines,
newsapapers and book publishing.
   Earlier this month, Hearst announced formation of New England
Cable Newschannel, an all-news cable network for the New England
region. Its partner in that deal is Continental Cablevision Inc.
   Hearst is also a partner with the French pay-TV network Canal
Plus in Ellipse Programme, a French production company specializing
in game shows, made-for-TV movies, animated programs and
documentaries.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Oct. 29, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,316.5 billion from $3,317.7 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,087.3 billion from $4,090.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $820.0 billion from $818.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the last 52 weeks was 3.8 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The growth rate in M3 over the past year was 1.5 percent, which is
within the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,312.4 billion, a 4.2
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,089.1 billion, up 2.0 percent, while M1
rose 5.6 percent to an average of $819.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $921 million.
   -The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $252 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$399 million the previous week.
   -The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $317.8 billion in the two-week period ended
Oct. 31, down from $318.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>States Seek Guidelines for Environmental Marketing Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers can be misled by some ``green''
marketing, according to 10 state attorneys general who called
Thursday for national guidelines for environmental marketing
claims.
   ``Consumers who want to purchase products that are good for the
environment should not become innocent victims of `green-collar'
fraud,'' New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said.
``Manufacturers should not be allowed to cash in on the public's
concern for the environment by making false and unsubstantiated
claims.''
   Uniform definitions for such words as ``recycled,''
``compostable'' and ``degradable'' would give businesses parameters
and make sure consumers get what they pay for, according to the
attorneys general task force set up last November to review
environmental advertising.
   In a report released Thursday, the group urged the Federal Trade
Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency to work with
states, businesses and consumer groups to set the standards.
   The report also recommended ``testing procedures and standards
for determining whether a product meets a particular definition.''
   The task force said environmental claims should be as specific
as possible and avoid overly broad or vague terms like
``environmentally friendly'' or ``safe for the environment.''
   ``Generalized environmental claims may create an unwrranted
impression that a product is good for the environment in all
respects,'' the report said.
   And because the word ``recycled'' does not provide consumers
with enough information to compare products meaningfully, the
attorneys general suggested the percentage of recycled material
used in the product be listed.
   The 40-page report also said claims that a product is degradable
or recyclable should not be made unless that particular disposal
option is available in the area where the product is sold.
   Some businesses were particularly upset with that suggestion,
saying it would not be feasible for national marketers.
   Pressure from consumer groups and state agencies has recently
resulted in advertising changes for several products.
   First Brands and Mobil Chemical Corp. agreed in June to drop a
claim that its Glad and Hefty trash bags were degradable after the
Texas attorney general filed a lawsuit.
   Last month, American Enviro Products Inc., of Placentia, Calif.,
agreed to stop promoting its Bunnies disposal diapers as
biodegradable after attorney generals in 10 states threatened to
sue.
   The attorneys general urged other companies ``to modify their
environmental marketing claims in light of the above
recommendations.''
   Those involved in the task force include the attorney generals
from California, Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New
York, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.
   State and federal officials will hold public hearings on the
recommendations in San Diego Dec. 10 and 11.

<HEAD>FCC OKs Pacific Digital Fiber-Optic Cables</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three fiber-optic, undersea telephone cables
linking the U.S. mainland, Hawaii, New Zealand and Guam got the
go-ahead Thursday from the Federal Communications Commission.
   The cables will carry as many as 80,000 digital conversations
simultaneously on laser pulses through hair-thin glass wire. They
are needed because of the expected large increase in phone, fax and
computer traffic between Pacific Ocean rim countries, the
commission said.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., one of the seven applicants
for the systems, says its Pacific rim business is growing at an
annual rate of about 12 percent to 14 percent - faster than its
transAtlantic traffic.
   The FCC said 65 percent of the traffic between the United States
and Australia now is being carried by satellites, and that more
capacity was needed.
   The FCC gave 5-0 approval for the projects to a consortium of
AT&amp;T, GTE Hawaiian Telephone Co., MCI International Inc., Overseas
Telecommunications Inc., TRT-FTC Communications Corp., US Sprint
Communications Co. and World Communications Inc.
   The cables will be jointly owned by the seven telecommunications
companies and telecommunications administrations from 14 foreign
locations, the FCC said.
   The HAW-5 cable will connect San Luis Obispo, Calif., with
Keawaula, Hawaii, at a cost of $199 million. The seven applicants
will contribute an estimated $156.5 million to the project, which
should be ready for service by early 1993, the FCC said. It will
have twice the capacity of the existing undersea cable.
   The PacRimEast cable will connect Takapuna, New Zealand, and
Keawaula, Hawaii. It will cost $279.6 million, with the seven
applicants' cost estimated to be $67.9 million.
   The PacRimWest cable will connect Sydney, Australia, and Dededo,
Guam. It will cost about $282 million, with the applicants picking
up $51.7 million of the tab. It is scheduled to begin service in
the fourth quarter of 1994.
   The first fiber-optic undersea cable went into operation in the
Atlantic in 1988. A Pacific fiber-optic cable followed in 1989.
   AT&amp;T announced plans on Oct. 17 to build a super-high capacity
fiber-optic line between the United States and Japan by 1996. It
will team with Japan's Kokusai Denshin Denwa in the project, which
will be able to handle 600,000 simultaneous conversations.
   FCC approval of that project is pending.

<HEAD>Wal-Mart Earnings Up 22 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said Thursday its
third-quarter earnings rose 22 percent as the retailer continued to
thrive despite a slowdown in consumer spending.
   Wal-Mart said it earned $282.8 million, or 25 cents per share,
in the quarter ended Oct. 31, up from $232.7 million, or 20 cents
per share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Sales at the Bentonville, Ark.-based company rose 26 percent to
$7.93 billion from $6.28 billion.
   Other retailers saw their sales slump during the quarter as
consumer confidence was shaken by the weakening economy and the
Persian Gulf crisis. Wal-Mart, which has outperformed the retail
industry for years, continued to do so in spite of the poor
environment.
   David Glass, Wal-Mart's president, said the company met its
goals for the quarter and for the first nine months of its fiscal
year.
   Wal-Mart earned $809.2 million, or 71 cents per share, for the
nine months ended Oct. 31, up from $650 million, or 57 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month sales totaled $22.24 billion, up from $17.7 billion.
   The company has 1,503 Wal-Mart discount stores, 141 Sam's
wholesale clubs and four Hypermart USA stores in 34 states.

   The government on Thursday
returned to private ownership the telephone company it nationalized
42 years ago.
   European and U.S. investors agreed to pay about $1.34 billion
for 60 percent of the Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones, or
ENTel. The privatization is one of the largest in Latin American
history.
   The contracts were signed Thursday night by President Carlos
Menem, who wants to privatize public companies to reduce the role
of the state in Argentina's economy.
   Another privatization, the sale of Aerolineas Argentinas, may be
completed within a month. The Spanish carrier Iberia has offered to
buy it.
   A group of investors led by Spain's phone company Telefonica and
U.S.-based Citibank won the bid for ENTel's southern operations.
The consortium agreed to pay $114 million in cash and $202 million
in notes, and to retire $2.7 billion in Argentina's foreign debt,
in return for a seven-year lease.
   Italian and French phone companies, along with U.S.-based J.P.
Morgan bank, were awarded ENTel's northern operations. That group
agreed to pay $100 million in cash and $178 million in notes, and
to retire $2.3 billion in Argentina's foreign debt.
   With the sale, the government rids itself of a company that lost
about $250 million last year. The government has no money to
upgrade ENTel's infrastructure and services that are ``in
collapse,'' said director Maria Julia Alsogaray.
   Investors hope that by increasing the number of lines by
one-third within six years, and lowering costs by trimming staff
and modernizing equipment, the two regional companies will be
profitable.
   Consumers view the sale with hope and dread. Service seems bound
to improve, but rates may be unaffordably high.
   The current rate of about 5 U.S. cents per pulse is one of the
highest in the world, analysts say. A pulse is a unit of time that
varies according to the distance of the call and the time of day it
is made.
   However, for many Argentines, the sale of ENTel may be the only
way to get phone service at any price.
   As many as one of every seven lines may be out of service at any
moment, and repairs can take months. Some Argentines wait years for
a line, or pay several thousand dollars for one.

   The British pharmaceutical maker SmithKline
Beecham on Thursday reported its pre-tax earnings rose 30 percent
in the third quarter, paced largely by U.S. sales of its anti-acne
and antacid products.
   SmithKline reported pre-tax earnings of 218 million pounds,
compared with earnings of 168 million pounds in the same period a
year earlier. The earnings were worth $408 million when the quarter
ended on Sept. 30, but the percentage increase in dollars would
likely have varied because of fluctuating exchange rates.
   Sales from continuing operations were 1.08 billion pounds, a 3
percent decrease from 1.11 billion pounds in the 1989 period.
   The company attributed the decrease to exchange rate
fluctuations, especially the weakening U.S. dollar.
   The main rise in profits came in the consumer brands sector,
which reported a 53 percent increase from the same period of 1989.
Sales of over-the-counter drugs were led in the United States by
its Oxy anti-acne products, which increased 15 percent, and Tums
antacid, which increased 30 percent.
   For the first nine months, the company had pre-tax profits of
634 million pounds, 8 percent higher than the 588 million pounds
earned a for the period a year earlier.

   Assets of the nation's 525 money market mutual
funds rose $2.94 billion in the latest week to a new record of
$418.33 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$140.4 million decline in fund assets the previous week, and broke
the record high of $415.53 billion set the week ended Oct. 24.
   The Washington-based mutual fund trade group said that in the
latest week, assets of 259 general purpose funds rose by $1.06
billion to $148.79 billion; assets of 104 broker-dealer funds rose
$608.5 million to $165.33 billion; and assets of 162 institutional
funds rose $1.27 billion to $104.22 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.38 percent from 7.42 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.42 percent from 7.45 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
49 days, up from 47 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts remained at 6.02 percent
as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, rose to 5.08 percent from 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.60
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.63
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.73 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.76 percent; 7.84 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.88
percent; and 8.05 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.03 percent.

<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. filed a lawsuit charging
the Chicago Board Options Exchange with violating a 1983 licensing
agreement for use of two widely known measures of stock market
activity.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, claims
the CBOE wrongly asserted an exclusive right to use the S&amp;P 100
Index and S&amp;P 500 Index on financial products other than options
contracts traded on the exchange.
   The CBOE on Thursday denied it had breached the agreement.
   In a statement, CBOE general counsel Nancy R. Crossman said the
exchange believes the licensing agreement gives it the exclusive
right to use the indexes ``in connection with the trading of
securities options.''
   ``The CBOE has always met all of its obligations under the
license agreement and has never breached the agreement since its
inception,'' the statement said.
   The S&amp;P 100 Index and S&amp;P 500 Index measure stock performance
and are traded in units on the nation's major options exchanges.
Options give an investor the right to buy or sell a security at a
specified time for a specific price.
   S&amp;P said its license limits the CBOE to options contracts on the
two indexes that are traded on a securities exchange and settled
through an established clearing house by payment of cash or the
underlying security.
   S&amp;P said the CBOE's rights do not apply to other financial
instruments that offer a return based in whole or part on the two
indexes. Those include notes, certificates of deposit and other
debt instruments, products that trade over the counter and
financial instruments issued by institutions other than an
exchange.
   The lawsuit asked the court to terminate the license with the
CBOE on Dec. 7, or to rule that the agreement does not extend to
financial instruments other than exchange-traded stock options as
defined in the agreement.
   S&amp;P, a subsidiary of McGraw-Hill Inc., said the withdrawal of a
note offering for Denmark because of the dispute has caused the
firm ``severe harm to its reputation and impairment of its
licensing business.''
   S&amp;P, a financial information and credit rating agency, for
several years has licensed the rights to use its indexes in
connection with financial products sold off of exchanges.

   Hoechst Celanese Corp. on Thursday
blamed a 26 percent drop in third-quarter earnings on a continued

   The company reported $49 million in earnings on $1.4 billion net
sales for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares to earnings of
$66 million on revenues of $1.5 billion for the same period last
year.
   ``We experienced lower earnings this quarter because of the
continued slowdown in the economy, which has affected many of the
markets we serve,'' said Ernest H. Drew, president and chief
executive officer of the company based in Somerville.
   Hoechst Celanese is a wholly owned subsidiary of Hoechst AG of
Germany. It deals in chemicals, fibers, advanced materials and
technologies, and life sciences.
   Sales declined in three of the company's four major divisions
this quarter: chemicals, life sciences and fibers and film.
   A strong demand for super-absorbent materials used in diapers
boosted sales of specialty chemicals by $24 million to $351
million, for a 7.3 percent gain over the same quarter last year.
   But in the life sciences group, net sales fell $17 million to
$126 million, or 12 percent, after strong sales in 1989 of Trental,
a drug used to treat geriatric disease.
   Sales of the blood medication were especially strong in the
third quarter of 1989 because the company announced a
fourth-quarter price increase last year.
   Sales in fibers declined from $643 million to $605 million,
while sales in chemicals fell from $433 million to $395 million.
   In the first nine months, the company earned $159 million on
revenues of $4.2 billion, compared to earnings of $214 million on
$4.5 billion in sales for the same period last year.

<HEAD>Weaker U.S. Economy Slows Disney Earnings Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weakening economy slowed profit
growth at Walt Disney Co. to 9 percent in the quarter that ended
Sept. 30, the entertainment giant said Thursday.
   In a joint statement, Chief Executive Michael Eisner and
President Frank Wells said theme park attendance had dropped off
during the crucial summer months. Despite higher per capita
spending, operating income from the parks rose just 1 percent for
the fourth fiscal quarter, Disney said.
   Company earnings increased 17 percent in the full year. Eisner
and Wells have set a goal of 20 percent growth in profits over any
five-year period. The company posted earnings increases of 17.6, 20
and 23 percent in the first three quarters of the fiscal year.
   Recession fears and other concerns have caused investors to
knock Disney's stock price down from a high of $136.50 per share in
the past year to the $90 range in recent weeks.
   During the fourth fiscal quarter, Disney earned $232.7 million,
or $1.72 per share, compared to $212.7 million, or $1.54 per share,
during the same period in 1989. Revenue rose 27 percent, to $1.71
billion from $1.35 billion.
   The per-share figure was toward the lower end of analysts'
estimates.
   For the fiscal year, Disney earnings rose to $824 million, or $6
per share, on revenue of $5.8 billion. Last year, earnings were
$703 million, or $5.10 per share, on revenue of $4.6 billion a year
earlier.
   During the fourth quarter, operating income in Disney's filmed
entertainment segment rose 22 percent, led by home video sales of
``Peter Pan'' and the syndication of the ``Golden Girls''
television series.
   Operating income from the consumer products segment increased 8
percent for the quarter.
   Disney doesn't break out attendance figures for its theme parks.
But the company characterized them as strong for the full year
despite the disappointing fourth quarter. Higher per capita
spending at all theme parks and benefit from Disney's 49 percent
stake in Euro Disneyland SCA helped operating profits for the
quarter and year, the company said.

<HEAD>Media Baron Decries New York Violence and Newspaper Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch said Thursday he was horrified by
the rising violence in New York, which the media baron blamed
partly on what he called the shortcomings of the city's
union-controlled newspapers.
   Murdoch, chief executive of the worldwide media empire News
Corp., also called the city's newspaper unions, currently on strike
against the Daily News, the world's worst since the demise of the
British newspaper unions which his company broke in a bitter labor
struggle in the mid 1980s.
   ``The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that the crime problem in
New York is quite simply horrible. In fact, it seems to be
unprecedented in American history,'' Murdoch said in a speech at
New York University. ``It's certainly worse than the Wild West.''
   In that lawless era, he said, gunfighters generally shot each
other, crimes like murder ``almost never affected innocent people,
and crimes like robbery and rape were far more infrequent than
today.''
   He said the city's press was to some extent responsible because
``the media's inibitions about reporting the crime wave resulted in
a sort of false consciousness among the public.''
   Murdoch, one of the world's wealthiest men, maintains several
homes, including a penthouse overlooking Manhattan's Central Park.
His company owns several newspapers, magazines and television
operations around the world, mainly in the United States, Britain
and Australia.
   In addition, News Corp. is parent of the Fox Broadcasting Co., a
national programming service for independent TV stations, and has
extensive interests in book publishing activities.
   Murdoch owned the New York Post from 1976 to 1988. His company
still owns WNYW, a local New York Fox TV channel.
   When Murdoch ran the Post he was regularly denounced for what
critics called overly sensational coverage of brutal crimes that
appealed to the public's ``base passion.''
   ``I don't agree that I took it too far downmarket,'' Murdoch
told his audience Thursday. ``I think I didn't take it downmarket
far enough.''
   Regarding the city's powerful newspaper unions, which have been
striking the Post's rival tabloid the News since last month,
Murdoch called them one of the obstacles to better newspaper
operations and journalism in the city.
   ``As you will know, in 1986 I took on the printing unions in
Britain, the world's worst, and broke them,'' he said. ``The result
has been a silver age for British journalism: newly prosperous
papers and wholly new papers.''
   With the demise of those unions, he said, ``the New York City
unions have succeeded to the distinction of being the world's
worst.''
   Murdoch was the guest speaker at the ninth Chet Huntley Memorial
Lecture, named after the late television journalist.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Stock Fall</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the yen Friday morning
following President Bush's announcement that he is sending more
troops to the Middle East. Stock prices fell, continuing a slide
that began Tuesday.
   The dollar was changing hands at 130.38 yen at late morning. It
opened at 130.45 yen, up 0.95 yen from Thursday's close, and ranged
between 130.30 yen and 131 yen during early trading.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 346.23 points, or 1.51
percent, ending the morning session at 22,623.58. The index lost
530.44 points Thursday.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond fell to 83.94 points from Thursday's
84.26-point finish. Its yield was higher at 7.950 percent from
7.875 percent.
   Stock traders said the Nikkei fell quickly with the majority of
investors avoiding buying shares because of increasing tensions in
the Middle East.
   The declining yen and the government bond prices, resulting from
investors' fears about the Gulf, also accelerated the Nikkei's
plunge, a trader with Nomura Securities Co. said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``Nobody was interested in buying. ... Japanese institutional
investors, as well as foreign investors are all sitting on the
sidelines,'' he said.
   The Nomura trader said political uncertainties resulting from
the government's lack of leadership in deciding Japan's role in the
Gulf made investors reluctant to trade.
   Amid worries over the increasing tensions in the Middle East,
Japanese currency investors bought the dollar up to the 131-yen
level on short covering before the start of a three-day weekend in
Tokyo, dealers said. Japanese financial markets will be closed on
Monday for a national holiday commemorating the Emperor Akihito's
enthronement.
   War in the Middle East would likely drive the price of oil
sharply higher. The dollar normally rises with oil prices because
crude is bought and sold in dollars. Also, the currency
traditionally has been viewed as a safe haven in times of
international turmoil.
   ``As long as the Middle East crisis continues, the dollar's
plunge will be prevented,'' said Katsumi Oshima, a researcher at
Sanyo Securities Co.
   But Oshima said the dollar's recent upswing is the result of
adjustments by investors who had overbought the yen.
   Overall market conditions still favor a stronger yen because
``the U.S. economy is definitely headed toward a recession,'' he
said.
