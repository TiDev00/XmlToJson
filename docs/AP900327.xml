   California's first execution in 23
years may be less than a week away, and some surveys suggest that
80 percent of the state's residents think it's about time.
   But there's a small, vocal minority trying to change the hearts
and minds of those who believe that death is the proper punishment
for taking a human life.
   At 3 a.m. on April 3, unless appeals are successful, 37-year-old
Robert Alton Harris will be strapped into San Quentin's
7-square-foot apple-green gas chamber, and a cloud of cyanide gas
will end his troubled life.
   State attorneys in San Diego on Tuesday filed their response to
Harris' federal appeal, saying there is nothing new in the latest
petition to warrant a stay of execution.
   Harris' attorneys were to reply Wednesday and a hearing was
scheduled for then. If U.S. District Judge William Enright rejects
their stay request, the defense lawyers' next move would be to file
a petition with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A denial at
the 9th Circuit would leave only an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which has denied Harris' appeals four times.
   Jim Young of Oakland is conducting a three-week vigil outside
the prison.
   ``Should we as a society use the same language as the murderer _
the language of death _ and create new victims? Society must rise
above the level of the murderer,'' said Young.
   On Monday, Young, a member of Death Penalty Focus, sat by a
black cardboard coffin and signs reading ``Don't Kill For Me'' and
``The Death Penalty Is Dead Wrong.''
   Two other people, including the wife of another death-row
inmate, stood nearby.
   Also on hand were a man and a woman, who declined to identify
themselves, carrying signs applauding the execution and urging
people to remember his victims.
   On Tuesday, Roman Catholic priests from around the state led a
prayer service outside the main gate against the execution. Four
capital punishment foes were arrested for blocking a road,
authorities said.
   Harris, on parole after a manslaughter conviction, was sentenced
to die for the 1978 murders of San Diego 16-year-olds John Mayeski
and Michael Baker. He abducted them at a burger stand to use their
car in a bank robbery.
   ``We know we're up against a hard rock of public opinion. But
(people) say they're for the death penalty because it's been sold
to them,'' said Young, burned by the sun and slightly weak from the
early stages of a 10-day fast.
   ``That's why we're out here at the gate _ to give out
information.''
   Members of other groups opposed to capital punishment also have
been fasting, speaking out, taking turns in the vigil and writing
to Gov. George Deukmejian asking for clemency.
   In London on Tuesday, about 30 members of Amnesty International
protested outside the U.S. Embassy. The human rights organization
left a letter for the ambassador expressing concern that there will
be a precedent created for other American states not currently
carrying out executions.
   Death penalty foes also fear Harris' execution could be quickly
followed by many others in California. More than 270 other men are
on San Quentin's death row. Prosecutors discount such a possibility
because each prisoner gets the same appeals that have helped delay
Harris' execution for 11 years.
   Opponents argue that capital punishment is immoral, is not a
deterrent and is a poor way to convince people that murder is wrong.
   Yet the San Francisco-based Field Institute, which conducts The
California Poll, found in mid-1986 that 83 percent of Californians
supported capital punishment and 14 percent were opposed.
   California law provides for life without possibility of parole.
But some people are skeptical it assures murderers won't be
released to kill again.
   ``What's to say the people of the state of California ... won't
elect another Jerry Brown into office and end up with a parole
board to let those people out?'' said Steve Baker, a policeman and
the father of one of Harris' young victims.
   Brown, the state Democratic Party leader, is a former governor
known for his liberal judicial appointments.
   Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation, a national victims' rights group based in Sacramento,
argued that sentencing murderers to life without parole does not
assure they will not kill other prisoners or guards.
   Rushford maintains there's little risk of executing an innocent
man.
   ``The chances of an innocent person being convicted of a serious
crime in this country is many, many times less than the chance of
being murdered,'' he said.

   More than 100 feet of Interstate 90
collapsed and slid into Lake Coeur d'Alene on Tuesday evening, but
there were no injuries, authorities said.
   The section of the eastbound lane east of this northern Idaho
resort town ``sloughed off'' into the lake near a boat ramp, said a
state police spokeswoman who would only give her name as Glenna.
   There were no injuries and no cars left the highway, she said.
Traffic was restricted to the westbound lane.
   The accident occurred at a site where contractors hired by the
state have been filling about 5 acres of the lake with dirt to make
room along the shore for an I-90 interchange being built.
   The section fell into the lake because mud on the bottom of the
lake apparently didn't support the weight of the fill, said Don
Johnson of the state Department of Transportation, who was called
to the site.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This new country's black leaders,
avowed socialists during their long exile, are now looking to
businessmen and foreign investors to help develop the nation.
   The week-old government says it has learned from the mistakes of
Africa's socialist-oriented economies, which have failed even more
dramatically than those in Eastern Europe.
   President Sam Nujoma, in a major economic speech one week ago on
independence day, did not make a single reference to socialism and
promised ``a dynamic role for the private sector.''
   ``We are committed to a mixed economy,'' said Nujoma. ``We look
forward to a good partnership between the state and the private
sector.''
   Less than a year ago, Nujoma and other members of his South-West
Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, were returning from exile
and declaring their ``belief in the moral superiority of socialism
over capitalism.''
   But as independence from South Africa neared, the rhetoric
changed.
   ``I think the leaders were quite impressed with the development
in many parts of the country, especially Windhoek,'' said Rainer
Ritter, a private economist. ``They were coming from poor (African)
countries, and they didn't want Namibia to go the same way.''
   A senior South African official, who requested anonymity, said
SWAPO leaders revised their economic policies after Western nations
said they would not provide aid to a socialist-oriented economy.
The Soviets and former East bloc nations, the main backers of SWAPO
during its war against South African rule, had no money to give.
   All the southern African nations that have relied on state
control of the economy _ Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and
Mozambique _ have suffered economic declines or fallen far short of
their potential. All now are making at least limited attempts to
restructure their economies.
   The one black-ruled capitalist country in the region, Botswana,
has one of the highest growth rates in the world and often is cited
by economists as a model for development.
   Nujoma and his Cabinet, made up mostly of ex-guerrilla leaders
with no experience in managing an economy, stress that the skills
and money of white businessmen and foreign investors are essential
in building Namibia.
   Nujoma has named two white businessmen, Otto Herrigel and Gert
Hanekom, as his ministers of finance and agriculture.
   On independence day, the government announced an agreement with
the British firm Lonrho to build a $150 million sugar refinery that
could create 4,000 jobs in a country where the unemployment rate is
more than 30 percent.
   The huge, arid nation boasts profitable mining, fishing and
farming industries and one of the best economic bases in Africa,
much of it built with money from South Africa, which ruled Namibia
for 75 years.
   The 23-year war between Nujoma's guerrillas and the South
African-led security forces claimed more than 20,000 lives, but was
restricted to the rugged bush in the north.
   The fighting caused only limited damage to roads, schools and
villages.
   Namibia's annual per capita income tops $1,000, a figure only a
handful of Africa's more than 50 nations have reached.
   However, the wealth is disproportionately controlled by whites,
who account for just 75,000 of the country's 1.3 million people.
SWAPO estimates that whites own about two-thirds of private
property and earn about 10 times as much as blacks on average.
   The most pressing economic task for the government will to be
meet rising black expectations without alienating whites, who can
move to neighboring South Africa.
   The Namibian government is facing a deficit of almost $200
million on this year's budget of about $900 million. The foreign
debt is more than $300 million, relatively modest compared to most
nations on the heavily indebted continent.
   So far, Namibia's leading aid donors have been West Germany,
which has agreed to give $59 million, and Britain, which will give
$16 million. The United States has not yet completed an aid
package, but is expected to announce a plan shortly.
   South Africa has cut assistance to Namibia after steadily
reducing its aid in recent years, but South African President F.W.
de Klerk said trade talks and other ties will remain strong.
   Namibia is heavily dependent on South African for imports. More
importantly, South Africa controls Walvis Bay, the only deep-water
port along Namibia's coast.
   Walvis Bay is more than 600 miles from the nearest South African
territory. But the Pretoria government claims ownership based on
Britain's 1884 decision to annex Walvis Bay and make it part of
South Africa's Cape Colony.
   Namibia's constitution claims Walvis Bay as part of the new
nation. South Africa, which has army, naval and air force bases in
Walvis Bay, said it is willing to enter negotiations on the status
of the territory, which has 26,000 residents.

<HEAD>Florida Thrift's Collapse Could Cost More Than $2 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is examining $328,000 in
political donations by the chairman of a failed Florida thrift,
while a top regulator says the institution's failure could rival
the $2.5 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   A ``fraud squad'' of federal examiners is investigating the
legality of contributions from CenTrust Savings Bank Chairman David
L. Paul to state and national politicians, said L. William Seidman,
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution
Trust Corp.
   The propriety of meetings between Paul and politicians and
regulators also is being examined, Seidman said Monday. Any
evidence of wrongdoing will be given to the Justice Department, he
said.
   Seidman, in testimony to the House Banking Committee, said the
failure of Miami-based CenTrust, Florida's largest S&amp;L, will cost
taxpayers ``probably in excess of $2 billion.''
   Until now most analysts counted Lincoln, based in Irvine,
Calif., as the nation's worst S&amp;L collapse.
   ``It's going to be a horse race and I'm afraid that whoever the
winner is, it's going to set a record,'' Seidman said.
   CenTrust, which spent millions of dollars on yachts, limousines,
fine art, gold-plated toilets and other luxuries, was seized by the
government Feb. 2. It made few residential mortgages and
specialized in junk bond investing, many underwritten by Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   In other S&amp;L developments:
   _The Office of Thrift Supervision reported Monday that the
nation's S&amp;Ls lost $19.2 billion last year, up from $13.4 billion
in 1988 and the third straight record. S&amp;Ls lost money in 33
states, earned profits in 15 and broke even in two.
   _Lawyers for Lincoln S&amp;L spent the 13th day of hearings trying
to convince U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin in Washington that
regulators' April 1989 takeover of Lincoln was unwarranted.
Testimony focused on a tax-sharing agreement that regulators said
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. used to funnel money from the
S&amp;L to his holding company.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the ranking Republican on the
Banking Committee, released a list of Paul's political contacts,
which included a luncheon with former President Carter in June 1988.
   Paul met twice with Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of
the Senate Banking Committee, in November 1987 and August 1988. The
second meeting included Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., the No. 2
ranking Democrat in the Senate.
   Riegle and Cranston are among the so-called ``Keating five'' _
senators who accepted political contributions from Keating and are
accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators on his
behalf.
   Paul's desk calendar, according to Wylie, showed that Sens. Bob
Graham, D-Fla.; Timothy Wirth, D-Colo.; and John Kerry, D-Mass.,
flew on CenTrust's corporate jet in 1987 and 1988. All are now
members of the Senate Banking Committee, although Kerry was not at
the time.
   The CenTrust chairman held receptions aboard his $7 million
yacht maintained at company expense in September 1988 for Louisiana
Democratic Sens. J. Bennett Johnston and John Breaux.
   Atlanta-based federal regulators told the House Banking
Committee they were not contacted by politicians on behalf of
CenTrust, although they said Paul frequently bragged of his
connections.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking panel,
said examiners in Atlanta recommended seizing CenTrust as early as
January 1986 but were ignored by superiors in Washington.
   Paul met four times with M. Danny Wall, then chairman of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board _ in September and November 1987 and
January and June 1988.
   Paul had been scheduled to testify to the committee, but he said
through an attorney that he had not decided whether to appear.
Gonzalez gave Paul two weeks to set a date and said he could be
subpoenaed if the committee approves.
   A list of political contributions provided by Seidman showed
that most of Paul's gifts were to Democrats, although Republicans
received some smaller donations.
   Among contributions of $5,000 or greater were:
   _$5,000 in 1988 to Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., a member of the
Senate Banking Committee and now also chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee.
   _$10,000 in 1989 to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
   _$5,000 in 1988 to Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   _$12,000 from 1987 to 1989 to Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla.
   _$106,500 from 1987 through 1989 to Democratic fundraising
efforts.
   _$50,000 in 1986 and 1988 to the Alliance for Capital Access, a
pro-junk bond lobbying group.
   _$10,000 to former Florida Gov. Reuben Askew, $15,000 to former
Rep. Buddy McKay and $5,000 to Florida Insurance Commissioner Bob
Gunter, all running for the Senate in 1988.
   _$5,000 in 1987 and 1988 to Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who
was running for president.

<HEAD>Accusations of Racism Hit Capitol Police Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Capitol police officials cope with
terrorist threats, tourists and foreign leaders, but their toughest
current challenge may be allegations of racism aired by their own
black officers.
   The accusations have left the police force racially polarized.
Black officers have accused top commanders, all white, of
discrimination. The police brass has denied the allegations, and
white officers have backed their superiors.
   Blacks brought their grievances to a House hearing last week,
appearing in such large numbers that a police security detail
normally would have been assigned to crowd control.
   This time it wasn't necessary, because the orderly spectators _
and key witnesses _ at the House Administration subcommittee
hearing were the police.
   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, chairwoman of the police
subcommittee, promised after hearing from both sides that reforms
were coming to ease the tension. She urged a ``constructive
dialogue'' between the black officers and Chief Frank A. Kerrigan.
   The police force that guards the Capitol complex has 1,238
officers, including 336 blacks _ 27 percent of the force.
   However, the top ranks of lieutenant, captain, inspector, deputy
chief, assistant chief and chief include 61 whites and four blacks,
a minority percentage of 6.2 percent.
   House Sergeant-at-Arms Jack Russ, a member of the three-man
Capitol Police Board, said that before an objective written test
was instituted in 1983, the department was a ``good old boy
network'' with ``car pool promotions.''
   ``But that's been changed,'' said Russ, who serves on the
governing board with Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni and
Architect of the Capitol George White.
   Sgt. Ronald L. Richardson, executive director of the newly
organized Capitol Police chapter of the National Black Police
Association, said ``cronyism and nepotism'' still exist in
promotions, assignments and training for advancement.
   ``We do not have a single black in a policy or decision-making
position above the rank of captain,'' he said.
   Blacks who apply for top positions are told vacancies have been
filled, only to later learn ``the person selected for the position
was hand-picked,'' Richardson said. ``Soon, it also comes to light
that the person selected ... had been chosen prior to the official
announcement of the job vacancy.''
   And why, Richardson demanded to know, were several black
officers fired after being accused of drug use, while white
officers similarly accused were allowed to remain on the force.
   Chief Kerrigan said he was unaware of those cases and has told
Richardson to provide him a list of specific examples of
discrimination.
   ``I won't stand for any type of discrimination whatsoever. If it
was brought to my attention I would do something about it. I asked
for a third party to investigate. If there's any discrimination,
I'm unaware of it,'' Kerrigan said.
   Russ added: ``There may be racism in this department. If there
is racism, where is it? Come back with a list of your problems. We
never had one complaint until a couple of weeks ago.''
   A number of white police officers, including several women,
wrote the subcommittee to deny any discrimination.
   ``As a female Caucasian official on the United States Capitol
Police force, I do not feel that there is a problem with
discrimination,'' wrote Sgt. Ruth B. Micer. She recalled using her
vacation to study for written and oral tests she regarded as fair
to everyone.
   Another letter, by Lts. Price S. Goldston and Stanley J.
Grochowski Jr., both white, added: ``We have no knowledge of racial
discrimination existing within the United States Capitol Police.''
   Kerrigan said the best way to make room for blacks at the top is
to create a new retirement system. Currently, top white officers
stay at their jobs because they must work 30 years and be age 55 or
older to qualify for retirement _ longer than in other local police
departments.
   The chief proposed a system to allow retirement at age 50 after
20 years of service, or after 25 years of service regardless of age.

<HEAD>The Nixon Rule: No Man Can Write His History</HEAD>

   Richard Nixon says he has resigned himself to
what history will say about him if it can say it in only a sentence:
   ``He resigned the office.''
   He would have it otherwise, he suggested, but he can't budge
history's version. Presidents can write their slogans, but not
their epitaphs.
   Jimmy Carter campaigned on, ``I'll never lie to you,'' but
that's not what people remember about him.
   Gerald Ford came closer. Installed in office unelected, he went
to Congress modestly, saying: ``I'm a Ford, not a Lincoln.''
History agrees.
   The matter of capsulizing presidents in a sentence came up in an
interview Nixon had with Time magazine to coincide with the
publication of his latest book.
   ``Clare Boothe Luce (writer, diplomat, wife of Time magazine's
founder) once said that each person in history can be summed up in
one sentence,'' said Nixon. ``This was after I had gone to China.
She said, `You will be summed up, `He went to China.'''
   Added Nixon: ``Historians are more likely to lead with `He
resigned the office.'
   ``The jury has already come in, and there's nothing that's going
to change it. There's no appeal. Historians will judge it harshly.''
   What would history say, in a sentence, about other presidents?
   Lyndon Johnson, Nixon's predecessor, a complicated president,
takes two thoughts. Something like, ``He declared war on poverty,
but got bogged down in Vietnam.''
   Ford, Nixon's successor, served two years and achieved little of
lasting effect. But his first words as president were, ``Our long
national nightmare is over,'' and he, in fact, healed Watergate's
wounds until he reopened Watergate's divisions.
   Sum him up: ``He ended a nightmare, then pardoned Nixon.''
   Ford was succeeded by Jimmy Carter, who is remembered for a
single word he did not utter: ``malaise.'' Carter made a midway
speech about the nation's vague sense of unease. Its theme
characterized his tenure.
   He provided plenty of images: the unimperial president walking
down Pennsylvania Avenue, wearing a sweater on television,
persuading the stubborn leaders of Israel and Egypt to make peace,
a detail man who worried about who would use the White House tennis
court.
   Sum it up: ``His micromanaged presidency didn't work.''
   At the time Ronald Reagan occupied the Oval Office, Washington
talked of ``the Reagan revolution,'' but in a year's retrospection
it was a revolution that didn't seem to have changed so much.
   Reagan was disengaged but persuasive, a hands-off president. His
contribution seems more one of spirit than substance.
   How about: ``He gave America confidence _ and deficits.''
   Harry Truman felt like ``the earth, the moon and the stars'' had
descended on him when Franklin Roosevelt unexpectedly died and left
the presidency to him. He is most memorable for his gutsy 1948
election campaign, winning when all thought he would lose.
   For Truman: ``The little man who beat the odds to keep the
office.''
   FDR was the only president elected four times, and was despised
by his enemies for that and a lot of other reasons. They would have
chosen epithet for epitaph: ``A traitor to his class.''
   But history's already in: ``He led America out of the Depression
and the Allies to victory.''
   Dwight Eisenhower succeeded Truman, a grandfatherly figure of
enormous popularity but a bare record: ``They liked Ike.''
   John F. Kennedy was young, elegant and eloquent, but his
presidency is summed up in one sad fact: ``He was shot to death in
Dallas.''
   There were a lot of other presidents, 41 so far. Except for two
so famous they need no names, first or last (``father of his
country'' and (``freed the slaves and saved the union''), history
would have trouble summarizing most of the rest in a sentence.
   It's hard enough remembering their names.

<HEAD>Jessica Tandy Latest Honor is `Tip-Top'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After six decades as an actress and with
everything from a Tony to an Emmy to an Obie under her arm,
80-year-old Jessica Tandy could have picked up the actress Oscar
and said it was about time.
   Instead she wondered aloud why the producers of ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' chose someone whose forte is the stage to play a lead in a
movie.
   ``I think I'm very lucky they trusted me with such a wonderful
part,'' Miss Tandy told reporters backstage at the Los Angeles
Music Center Monday night.
   ``They could have picked someone with more experience,'' she
said, drawing incredulous laughter from the press corps. ``I never
thought of myself as a movie actress.''
   And the many honors she has earned over the years didn't blunt
the thrill of winning Hollywood's coveted golden statuette.
   ``It means tip-top. It's very, very important,'' she said. ``I'm
walking on air at the moment.''
   Informed that she was the oldest winner of an Academy Award,
Miss Tandy replied, ``Am I the oldest? Well good for me!'' But not
by much. In 1976, George Burns won for his supporting performance
in ``The Sunshine Boys.'' He was 80 and three months at the time.
Miss Tandy is 80 and nine months.
   She has won many acting honors: Tony awards for her stage role
as Blanche DuBois in ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' and her parts in
``The Gin Game'' and ``Foxfire;'' an Obie for her part Samuel
Beckett's ``Not I,'' and an Emmy for the Hallmark Hall of Fame TV
production of ``Foxfire.''
   The actress had fierce competition in the category: Isabelle
Adjani for ``Camille Claudel,'' Pauline Collins for ``Shirley
Valentine,'' Jessica Lange for ``Music Box'' and Michelle Pfeiffer
for ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   Miss Tandy's husband, the celebrated actor Hume Cronyn, was
asked before the 62nd annual Academy Awards show how it felt to
have his wife take the spotlight all for herself.
   ``Furious, jealous, unhappy,'' he growled, ``and very proud.''

<HEAD>Union, Companies Disagree Over Success of Walkouts at Nuclear
Reactors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor leaders call walkouts at 37 nuclear
power plants a success as workers made a bid for union
representation, but companies involved say insignificant numbers of
workers stayed off the job.
   About 3,000 radiation technicians at nuclear reactors across the
nation closed for refueling were encouraged to walk off the job
Monday in a nationwide effort to have the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers become their bargaining agent.
   ``All I can tell you is it's working,'' said IBEW official A.V.
Griffies, who said it was impossible to say how many of the 3,000
technicians involved refused to go to work Monday.
   But several utility contractors said the walkouts had little
impact at the reactors where they provide workers to monitor
radiation levels.
   ``It has been business as usual,'' said Karen Armour, a
spokeswoman at Asca Brown Boveri Inc., of Stamford, Conn., the
parent of Power Systems Energy Services Inc.
   The company has more than 600 technicians working at nine sites.
``Very few'' workers failed to show, she said.
   Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
said the agency had been monitoring the situation and had not
received any reports that work at the closed reactors had stopped.
   Griffies said striking workers set up only one picket line _ at
the Turkey Point nuclear plant south of Miami where about 100
workers stayed off the job.
   Another 100 contract workers at Florida Power Corp.'s Crystal
River nuclear plant refused to work.
   Griffies declined to elaborate on why only one picket line was
established or to say how long the walkout would last.
   The IBEW, which already represents the majority of permanent
nuclear power plant workers, targeted eight utility contractors who
provide traveling ``health physics technicians'' to reactors that
close down for refueling or maintenance.
   Those technicians make between $11 and $14 an hour and have not
received pay increases in eight years, Griffies said.
   James P. Schmitt, spokesman for Westinghouse Electric Corp. in
Pittsburgh, said the strike ``is not having an impact with the
Westinghouse workers in the industry.''
   ``The call for the job action has had little or no impact,''
Schmitt said.
   Between 300 to 500 Westinghouse technicians are involved, he
said. The company has a pool of 1,000 workers, he said.
   Schmitt said substantial majority of technicians were on the
job, but ``we've had a couple here and there that have called in
sick. The numbers are insignificant, so it's conceivable that their
illnesses are legitimate.''
   Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. spokesman Art Sluzark said the
strike had not affected the company's Calvert Cliffs nuclear power
plant.
   All 98 of the technicians who work for Bartlett Nuclear of
Plymouth, Mass., reported for work Monday, he said.

<HEAD>World Demand for Oil May Soon Equal Production Capacity:
Schlesinger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In as little as two years, the world could be
using oil as fast as it can be pumped out of the ground, says
former Energy Secretary James R. Schlesinger.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
producing at more than 90 percent of capacity, while Soviet
production has dropped, Schlesinger told the Senate Energy
Committee on Monday. And he said that Iran and Iraq, despite ending
their war, are marketing considerably less oil than had been
anticipated.
   ``With the call on OPEC growing at over a million barrels per
day each year, we are only a couple of years away from the point
that demand would theoretically reach the level of present
capacity,'' Schlesinger said.
   John J. Easton Jr., an assistant energy secretary, gave the
committee a more optimistic report, although he and Schlesinger
agreed that U.S. oil production will continue to decline if present
consumption and exploration trends continue.
   In the long run, Easton said, ``Through concerted efforts to
find and produce more of our domestic resources, we may be able to
slow the rate of decline in U.S. production, but it is unlikely
under current conditions that we will be able to reverse the
trend.''
   Schlesinger, who also has served as director of the CIA and as
secretary of defense, said U.S. national security and economic
interests are threatened by the growing demand for foreign oil.
   ``There is a strong possibility of a 30 percent or 40 percent
increase in prices,'' he said. ``That we will have a price surge in
the decade seems to me to be beyond question.''
   U.S. demand for oil will grow by about 2 percent a year until
there are steep price increases, Schlesinger said. In a recent
month, he added, the United States had to rely on foreign sources
to meet a record 54 percent of its oil demand.
   Schlesinger said that by 1995, U.S. imports should reach as much
as 11 million barrels a day, compared with a net average of just
over 7 million barrels a day in 1989.
   ``The oil import bill then will likely exceed our present trade
deficit,'' he said. That would be in range of over $100 billion a
year.
   ``That statement, if correct, is of profoundest concern to the
U.S. economy,'' said Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the
Energy Committee.
   While domestic demand for oil has been growing, Schlesinger
said, U.S. production continues to fall. Drilling activity is low
by historical standards and the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska
is in declining production, he said.
   ``We may as well acknowledge that over the past decade the
United States as a practical matter abandoned the quest for energy
independence _ indeed, even the quest for low energy dependency,''
Schlesinger said. ``If we are to limit our future vulnerability,
either for national security or international financial reasons, we
shall have to reverse course _ and take vigorous action.''
   Schlesinger's formula for reducing imports includes increased
conservation, more tax incentives for domestic producers and
expanded drilling.
   Relying on renewable energy sources _ such as solar energy _
will not solve the problem because those sources do little for
transportation, which is responsible for the growth in demand for
oil, he said.
   Despite relaxed East-West tensions and the end of the Iran-Iraq
war, Schlesinger said, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be
increased from the present 750-million-barrel supply to 1 billion.

   O. Stillman Rockefeller, scion of one of the
world's richest families, was bitten by a shark while swimming at
an exclusive island resort once owned by Malcolm Forbes.
   Rockefeller, 30, was injured Saturday in waist-deep water off
Laucala Island, according to The Fiji Times newspaper. He said he
felt his right leg being pulled and looked down to see cuts caused
apparently by two bites.
   He said he swam to shore and crawled to his bungalow, where he
telephoned for help. At dawn Sunday, he was taken by the Forbes
private plane to a hospital in Lautoka, Fiji's second-largest city,
and later flew to the United States.
   Rockefeller is the grandson of James S. Rockefeller, who was a
chairman of the City Bank of New York, which became Citibank.
   The isolated resort is owned by the Forbes estate. Forbes, the
multimillionaire publisher, died Feb. 24.

   For better or worse or until billions do them
part, says the lawyer for Ivana Trump, who thinks his client should
get half of her estranged husband's fortune _ which he estimated at
$5 billion.
   ``Marital property is property gained by the husband and wife
during marriage regardless of in whose name it is held,'' said
Michael Kennedy.
   Papers were filed Monday saying Mrs. Trump had no intention of
seeking a divorce and had never waived the right to an ``equitable
share'' of the money Trump made during their 13-year marriage.
   Trump had no immediate response.
   Trump's lawyers have sought to enforce a 1987 post-marital
contract. But Kennedy said that contract ``does not waive or
release Mrs. Trump's right to such marital property.''
   Kennedy denied reports that the contract called for Mrs. Trump
to receive $25 million in the event the marriage broke up.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor hasn't completed half the
community service she was ordered to perform for slapping a
policeman but is organizing a charity auction instead.
   Municipal Judge Paul G. Rubin, who sentenced the hot-tempered
celebrity to 120 hours of work at a shelter for homeless women and
children, said he may hold a hearing to decide if Gabor's plans
meet the court's order.
   That suggestion left Miss Gabor fuming.
   ``That Judge Rubin, who I find utterly disgusting, thinks he was
punishing me with this but he is not,'' Miss Gabor said recently at
her Bel-Air home. ``I have done more than he said I should _ this
auction has taken so many hours I can't count them.''
   Miss Gabor, convicted of slapping Beverly Hills police Officer
Paul Kramer during a traffic stop June 14, was sentenced to the
community service and three days in jail and was ordered to pay
court costs and fines totaling more than $12,000.
   The jail term was stayed while she appealed the conviction.

   Mrs. LeBlond's divorce petition cited irreconcilable marital
differences but disclosed no details. The couple have two children,

   Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican
leader Howard Baker, will undergo lung surgery Wednesday, says a
family spokesman.
   Mrs. Baker was admitted Monday to St. Marys Hospital in
Rochester, Minn., said spokesman Tom Griscom. The hospital is
affiliated with the Mayo Clinic.
   Mrs. Baker underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1982. Griscom
said he did not think she had experienced a recurrence of the
disease, but that Baker wanted to wait until after the surgery to
provide further details.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen. Baker served in the Senate from 1966 until 1984
and was President Reagan's chief of staff in 1987-88.

   Kingpins from New England's most powerful
organized crime family were taken into custody in a three-state FBI
sweep that authorities said proved both the existence and
vulnerability of La Cosa Nostra.
   ``The case represents a stake in the heart of an organized crime
family from the boss on down,'' U.S. Attorney Dick Thornburgh said
after all but six of 21 alleged organized crime figures were under
arrest Monday.
   The 113-count indictments were especially significant for their
extensive description of a solemn blood initiation rite, said
Thornburgh, who was joined in Boston by FBI Director William
Sessions and U.S. attorneys for Massachusetts, Rhode Island and
Connecticut.
   ``It should lay to rest once and for all any doubts that the
Cosa Nostra is a figment of law enforcement's imagination.''
   FBI agents fanned out Monday over the three states to arrest the
alleged criminals on a range of charges including murder,
racketeering, kidnapping, drug trafficking, gambling, obstruction
of justice and witness intimidation. Reputed boss Raymond
``Junior'' Patriarca, son of the region's late reputed mob leader,
was arrested at 6:30 a.m. Monday at his home in Lincoln, R.I.
   Patriarca, 45, was transferred to Boston after a brief
appearance before a U.S. magistrate in Providence, R.I. In
Massachusetts, a magistrate ordered the alleged crime boss and
co-defendant Carmen A. Tortora held pending a hearing April 6.
   The 20 others named in the indictments were allegedly members of
the Patriarca organized crime family, whose induction ceremony was
detailed in the indictments secretly handed up last week and
unsealed Monday.
   According to the indictments, Patriarca and 17 other alleged
family members attended a ceremony in which four alleged mob
candidates ``received instructions concerning the rules of La Cosa
Nostra, agreed to kill any individual who posed a threat to the
organization and its members.''
   The indictment said the four took the following oath in Italian
before drawing blood from their index fingers: ``I ... want to
enter into this organization to protect my family and to protect
all my friends. I swear not to divulge this secret and to obey,
with love and omerta.''
   Omerta refers to the code of silence.
   A holy card with the image of the saint of the Patriarca family
was then burned as the following was repeated: ``As burns this
saint, so will burn my soul. I enter alive into this organization
and leave it dead,'' according to the indictments. Authorities did
not identify the saint.
   Sessions said the tapes of the induction ceremony in Medford in
October showed the bureau's ``ability to invade the inner sanctums
... with the intention to destroy them.''
   Other alleged mobsters were in custody pending court appearances
or held on previous charges that were superseded by the new
indictments. Lawyers said four suspects were expected to surrender
today, while two others remained at large Monday night.
   If convicted on all counts, each of the defendants faces from 40
years in prison and a fine of $500,000 to 85 years in jail and a
fine of $2.5 million.
   ``This has always been one of the major (organized crime)
families,'' said Dennis O'Callaghan, special agent in charge of the
investigation. ``And we've basically got the entire hierarchy.''
   Raymond Patriarca Sr., who died in 1984, was identified as head
of the New England La Cosa Nostra during 1969 U.S. Senate committee
hearings.
   He was arrested more than 40 times and convicted of 18 crimes
ranging from playing dice on a Sunday to armed robbery and
conspiracy to murder. He served seven years in prison.
   Law enforcement officials generally believe that Patriarca's son
inherited control of the New England mob on his father's death.

<HEAD>Akira Kurosawa Wins Honorary Oscar; Declares He Needs To Learn
More</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, who at age
80 received an honorary Oscar for 47 years of film making, got a
chuckle from the audience Monday night when he said he still had
much to learn.
   But Kurosawa, the director of such films as ``Ran,''
``Rashomon'' and ``Seven Samurai,'' was serious. He said he feared
he did not deserve the Academy Award because he did not fully
understand his art.
   ``Cinema is a marvelous thing, but to grasp its true essence is
very, very difficult,'' Kurosawa said through an interpreter.
   ``But what I promise you is that from now on I will work as hard
as I can at making movies, and maybe by following this path I will
achieve the true understanding, the true essence of cinema and earn
this award.''
   Kurosawa was introduced by directors Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas, with Spielberg praising him as ``a man who many of us
believe is our greatest living film maker and all of us know is one
of the few true visionaries ever to work in our medium.''
   Backstage, Lucas said that Kurosawa has a ``brilliant sense of
the cinema.''
   ``He's a director's director,'' said Lucas, who was inspired by
Kurosawa in making the ``Star Wars'' films.
   The audience gave Kurosawa a standing ovation as he took the
stage at the Los Angeles Music Center.
   The director then watched a filmed greeting from Tokyo, where he
was presented with a cake for his 80th birthday on Monday. The
audience in Los Angeles joined in singing ``Happy Birthday.''
   Kurosawa, credited with helping the world appreciate Japanese
film making, directed three films nominated for Academy Awards. His
1975 film ``Dersu Uzala,'' submitted by Russia, won as best foreign
language film.
   Along with Lucas, other directors have been inspired by Kurosawa.
   ``Seven Samurai'' was remade in the United States as the
``Magnificent Seven'' and ``Rashomon'' became ``The Outrage.'' The
spaghetti western ``A Fistful of Dollars'' was a remake of
``Yojimbo.''

   The tragedy was foretold, its prevention
attempted. But law enforcement failed customers of the Happy Land
Social Club, as experts say it is failing to protect the patrons of
other illegal nightspots.
   ``These places are fire traps. They're in violation of every
code imaginable,'' state Sen. Jeremy Weinstein, who led an
investigation of social clubs in 1981, said Monday. ``It's true for
every city in the country.''
   But it is in New York that the nightmare was realized:
Eighty-seven lives snuffed out in a rush of flame and toxic smoke
early Sunday. The Happy Land's habitues, mainly poor immigrants,
were trapped and felled in moments.
   It should not have happened. A year and a half ago, when seven
died in a similar fire, the mayor formed a task force to close down
unlicensed clubs. Soon after, the city ordered Happy Land closed
for fire safety violations.
   It apparently did close for a time _ and then opened again,
unnoticed by officialdom. ``These places reopen as fast as they
shut 'em down,'' said Charles Ryan, an ex-fire captain and now fire
science department chairman at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
   As a result, despite a renewed crackdown announced Monday, he
said, ``It wouldn't shock me if this happened again.''
   The simple problem is inadequate law enforcement, Ryan and
others said. But they also called it more complex than that _ a
combination of the city's enormous problems, shrinking budget and
paralyzing bureaucracy.
   And there is another, equally daunting factor: Tremendous demand
for the illegal but inexpensive clubs, particularly in poor
immigrant communities where life is difficult, diversions are
scarce and danger is commonplace.
   ``People who are living in tough conditions of life are going to
look for opportunities to blow off some steam,'' said Professor
William Kornblum, director of the Social Research Center at the
City University of New York's graduate school. ``They're going to
pay less attention to the dangers around them.''
   The hazards can be legion. At the Happy Land, authorities say
there was no open fire exit, no first-floor sprinkler system, no
proper emergency lights, and bars on the sole window. The only way
out was through the front door, and it was blocked by flames,
allegedly ignited by an arsonist.
   The deaths are all the more tragic for the city's failed effort
to shut the Happy Land down. ``This should never have happened,''
said Mayor David Dinkins. ``That club had been inspected. It had
been cited. And it had been ordered closed.''
   He immediately launched another crackdown, with police posting
vacate orders on 187 social clubs Sunday night.
   But vacate orders alone cannot solve the problem. ``Issuing a
piece of paper and saying, `You're closed' doesn't mean anything
unless you come around and whack the guy on the head,'' said Ryan.
   Identification of illegal clubs has been adequate, he said, with
2,031 inspections last year by the task force formed in 1988 by
then-Mayor Edward I. Koch. ``It's the follow-up that's weak,'' Ryan
said. ``That's the nut of the problem: inadequate enforcement.''
   Better enforcement would require more manpower. The police
estimate there are 1,220 social clubs in the city, with about 1,000
listed as inactive. But Happy Land was one of those ``inactive''
clubs, and Kornblum guessed the city in fact has 500 to 600
operating social clubs _ some legal, many not.
   ``It is true that complete enforcement is futile. The clubs are
always moving to new locations, always trying to stay a step or two
ahead of the authorities,'' Kornblum said. But he said aggressive
followup could save lives, if the city provided the resources.
   There are other approaches, as well. With a view of social clubs
as cultural centers, Kornblum suggested low-interest city loans for
legally operated clubs that could take the place of illegal dives.
   Ryan, for his part, suggested cracking down on the liquor
merchants who keep the clubs supplied, and possibly placing a legal
limit on retail liquor sales. Weinstein said he would investigate
the idea.
   Yet Weinstein, a Brooklyn Democrat, noted that little of this is
new. In 1981, his panel's report on illegal social clubs included
this warning, ``The potential fire hazard alone is of such
proportion that numerous lives could be lost at any time no matter
how minor the fire was at the outset.''
   ``How ironic that after so many years, we're still back where we
started,'' he said. ``Now a lot of people are going to be up in
arms over this. And then, eventually, it's going to fade _ until it
happens again.''

   Gov. Mario Cuomo's former drug treatment
commissioner started his new career Monday outside the state
Capitol with the same relish _along with some mustard _ that took
him to the upper reaches of government.
   ``I've never failed at anything, so I intend to succeed as a hot
dog vendor,'' said Julio Martinez, as he stirred onions and
sauerkraut in his new chrome steam cart featuring the message:
``He's Back! Knishner Martinez.''
   Martinez was director of the State Division of Substance Abuse
Services until he resigned in December amid allegations he had
steered state contracts to friends. But on Monday, he manned the
only food cart on State Street on a cold, snowy day typical of
early spring in Albany.
   ``I'm doing this because Julio Martinez has bills to pay,'' he
said. ``This is an honest and a decent way to make a living.''
   Martinez' first customer was his successor in state government,
Arthur Webb, New York's new director of substance abuse services.
   ``I have a friend who is selling hot dogs. I'm just buying a hot
dog,'' Webb said. He pronounced his lunch of a dog with ``the
works'' and soda delicious.
   State Sen. Joseph Galiber was Martinez' second customer, and
Ramon Rodriguez, director of the state Parole Board, was next.
   ``I wish he'd sell things like black beans and rice _ good
Latino dishes,'' said Rodriguez, as he downed his hot dog with
sauerkraut. ``In about two minutes I'll have indigestion.''
   Martinez, assisted by his wife Judy, had plenty of customers
lined up through the lunch hour, many stopping by during a break
from a conference for state Hispanic leaders.
   Martinez said his new venture wasn't meant to embarrass Cuomo or
protest his treatment by the administration.
   ``The governor was good to me. He's one of my heroes,'' said
Martinez.
   Martinez, who made $87,300 a year in his state job, said he'd
continue to deliver the anti-drug message along with frankfurters.
   ``If a parent comes up I'll give her the right information, I
still have a lot of contacts in the field,'' said Martinez, a
former heroin addict who wore a ``Knockout Drugs'' T-shirt under
his white chef's jacket.
   ``If a kid comes up and wants to talk, I'll sit down and talk.
It's advice from the top dog, You can't get any better,'' he said.
   Webb refused to accept his 25 cents in change.
   ``Take it for the kids,'' he said. ``We're going to start our
own drug program out here.''
   The sidewalk space allotted for Martinez' city vending permit
used to be directly across the street from the state Capitol and
was visible from Cuomo's second-floor office window. But this year,
the vendors' spaces were moved a few hundred feet up the street at
the request of state officials, city officials said.
   Martinez' return to the state Capitol has received much
attention in the news media, but Cuomo apparently hadn't noticed.
   ``I didn't know Julio was outside,'' Cuomo said when asked if he
planned to lunch on Martinez' dogs. ``It's not on the schedule, but
you never know.''
   Last week, Cuomo said it wasn't likely he'd be eating his former
commissioner's fare.
   ``I don't eat frankfurters,'' said Cuomo. ``Does he sell pizza?''
   But it looks like Cuomo will have to go elsewhere.
   ``I'm not going to bend the rules for him or anybody else. It
says hot dogs, knishes and sodas. No pizza,'' said Martinez.

<HEAD>US Wants Expanded UN Observer Force for Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is calling on the United
Nations to increase a proposed observer force for Nicaragua to keep
tensions at a minimum when President-elect Violeta Chamorro takes
office next month.
   Under a plan agreed to last year by the five Central American
presidents, about 200 U.N. observers were to monitor the
Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   But under an agreement reached on Friday, the observers would be
assigned to protect the security of enclaves in Nicaragua where
Contra rebel leaders said they will deploy their forces next month.
   The agreement also calls for an internationally supervised
cease-fire in Nicaragua and for the disarming, by April 20, of
Contras based in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   The administration has been worried that progress toward
national reconciliation in Nicaragua, highlighted by last month's
elections, could be set back if warfare resumes between the
Sandinistas and the Contras. Mistrust between the two sides remains
high.
   On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called
the agreement historic and congratulated the parties on it. They
included the rebel leadership, officials of the Nicaraguan Roman
Catholic Church and aides to Mrs. Chamorro. She will take office
April 25.
   The agreement is to be guaranteed by the U.N. Observer Force for
Central America (ONUCA) and a separate commission comprised of U.N.
and Organization of American States officials.
   The U.N. force would be comprised of military personnel from
Spain, West Germany and Canada. The Bush administration has asked
Congress for $30 million to finance the peaceful reintegration of
the Contras into Nicaraguan society.
   ``We would encourage the parties to move forward as rapidly as
possible,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Towards that end, we urge the
United Nations to deploy an enlarged ONUCA force to Nicaragua as
rapidly as possible.''
   Left unclear from the agreement was the time frame for
demobilizing the Contras who are in Nicaragua. Published reports
said Monday that the rebels intend to remain in the enclaves for
months after Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   U.S. officials estimate the number of Contras inside Nicaragua
at about 5,500. President Daniel Ortega has said the total is 4,000
to 6,000 and has warned that the Contras plan a big offensive
shortly before Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   The Contras have said they are reluctant to disarm unless the
Sandinista security forces do the same. They are worried that Mrs.
Chamorro might not be able to control these forces once she takes
office.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the ``full cooperation'' of the Sandinistas is
required for fulfillment of the accord, including the ``assurance
of secure conditions for the Nicaraguan resistance.''
   This is consistent with the longstanding U.S. view that the
Contras should be required to demobilize only after ``democratic
and safe conditions'' prevail in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>US to Combat Cattle Plague with Sterile Flies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Americans plan to do a favor for the
Libyans by bombarding their country with billions of green flies
over the next few years to help wipe out a plague that threatens
livestock and humans.
   Researchers hope to wipe out the screwworm by releasing
sterilized male Mexican screwworm flies, who will mate with females
and prevent them from laying eggs that will hatch.
   The screwworm normally is transmitted from animal to animal, but
in cultures where people live close to their livestock, the flies
lay eggs in people's noses, and the worms eat their hosts' brains.
   The U.S. Agency for International Development is sponsoring the
project, and the actual aerial release of the sterile flies will be
from planes flown under international auspices.
   The flies found their way to Libya in mid-1988 apparently
through a shipment from South America. Previously, the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans had protected the rest of the world.
   Now there is no large body of water to prevent them from
spreading to other continents.
   A research laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in
North Dakota determined that the Mexican and Libyan species are
compatible. President Bush recently signed a law that permits the
sterile Mexican flies to be used outside the Western Hemisphere.
   Andrew Natsios, director of AID's Office of Foreign Disaster
Assistance, told reporters on Monday that the flies are especially
dangerous in countries where people live close to their farm
animals.
   ``In many developing countries the animals sleep in close
proximity to people and what happens at night when people are
sleeping is that the flies get into the nasal cavity of people and
lay their eggs ... and the eggs hatch,'' he said.
   ``People don't know it's there until it's well along in the
process. They have to have surgery to have the worms removed. What
happens is that if it's left untended the screwworm eats through
the nose into the brain and the person dies.''
   The scientific name for the fly is cochliomyia hominivorax, the
man-eating spiral midge.
   The screw-shaped larvae burrow deep into flesh, bone and
tissues. Official reports from Libya say 30 people have been
infected. Unofficial estimates go as high as 300.
   Wildlife is also affected, including endangered species,
according to AID.
   The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says 70
million head of cattle are in danger in North Africa alone and the
cost there could reach $250 million a year. The organization will
run the program.
   ``My office tries to prevent disasters before they happen,''
Natsios said. ``I do not look forward to running famine programs in
countries which have been attacked by the screwworm fly.''
   He called the screwworm more dangerous than the locust, because
the threat is constant. Locusts come in cycles and the threat
periodically dies away.
   Natsios said the program will cost about $80 million, some of
which will be contributed by other countries. It could put an end
to the threat before it gets out of Libya, but if it spread much
further all of Africa, the Middle East, parts of Asia and southern
Europe could suffer, AID said.

<HEAD>Report Sees U.S. Inroads in Foreign Vegetable Oil Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department trade report says
the United States may gain some of the foreign vegetable oil market
for rapeseed and canola but probably will take a back seat to
Canada as a major supplier.
   ``More and more U.S. farmers are interested in getting on the
rapeseed bandwagon,'' the report said. ``Now, even non-traditional
growing areas are getting excited about the prospect of growing
rapeseed.''
   Although the report uses the term rapeseed generically to
include canola, it does explain the distinction between the two
crops. Modified versions of rapeseed developed in Canada are
recognized as canola.
   The report, in the April issue of AgExporter magazine, said
there are no official USDA figures on rapeseed production, although
industry estimates are in the range of 65,000 to 100,000 acres of
so-called double-O or canola-type seed and 10,000 to 20,000 acres
of industrial-grade rapeseed.
   Plant geneticist Dick Auld of the University of Idaho, who
pioneered much of the current research in rapeseed varieties for
U.S. cultivation, said most of the increase is expected to occur in
the Southeast.
   Winter rapeseed is attractive as a rotation crop for winter
grain and as an erosion control on idle land, Auld said. Thus
commercial expansion of rapeseed in the Southeast will hinge on the
development of winter varieties that can be double-cropped
dependably with soybeans.
   The High Plains and Pacific Northwest will see smaller increases
in rapeseed production. Some lower-yielding wheat in the plains
probably will give way to rapeseed, and in the Northwest the crop
could be rotated every fourth year with wheat.
   Field trials of early maturing hybrid winter rapeseed in the
Midwest have had mixed success, and Auld in the report predicted
widespread commercial use of high-yielding winter hybrids is not
likely before 1995.
   The report was written by Margaret E. Thursland and Jeanne F.
Bailey of the USDA agency's oilseeds and products division.
   Rapeseed is an ancient crop, a member of the Brassica family,
which includes mustard, turnips and cabbage. It is well-known
throughout Asia, Middle East and Europe as a vegetable oil and for
industrial purposes.
   Canada is the leading exporter of rapeseed and Japan is the No.
1 single-country importer. Canada's rapeseed exports to Japan
average about 1.5 million metric tons annually. In 1989, U.S.
exports to Japan were less than 2,000 tons.
   ``While the United States certainly cannot compete in volume
with Canadian producers, there could be a niche as a residual
supplier of rapeseed to Japan and Mexico, the two largest importers
of rapeseed outside of the European Community,'' the report said.
   Another factor in the future of U.S. production is the easing of
federal commodity programs to allow the substitution of certain
crops _ including rapeseed and canola _ without losing crop acreage
base.

   An Agriculture Department survey shows that
wind damage to land in the Great Plains has increased sharply,
mainly because of lingering drought in North Dakota.
   Manly Wilder, associate chief of the department's Soil
Conservation Service, said Monday that 4.93 million acres were
reported damaged through February since the season began on Nov. 1.
   That compared with about 4.7 million acres damage by wind in the
same four months of 1988-89.
   ``We're seeing the continued effects of several years of
drought,'' Wilder said. ``There's not enough vegetative cover, and
this year there's also not been much snow cover in a lot of
places.''
   The greatest damage was in North Dakota, with a state record of
1.6 million acres damaged, about one-third of the total reported
for 541 counties in the 10 Great Plains states.
   Only in the 1954-55 season was more land damaged by wind in the
Great Plains during the first four months of the season, Wilder
said. The season runs through May.
   In the seven-month 1988-89 season, a total of 14.3 million acres
were damaged by wind in the Great Plains, the most since nearly 16
million acres were damaged in 1954-55, the year the agency began
keeping records.
   According to the survey, the state-by-state breakdown comparing
damaged acres through February with the damage during the same four
months a year earlier, included:
   _Colorado, 263,890 acres damaged this season and 154,550 in
1988-89.
   _Kansas, 161,840 and 520,905.
   _Montana, 888,595 and 1,393,625.
   _Nebraska, 87,550 and 81,180.
   _New Mexico, 88,290 and 54,600.
   _North Dakota, 1,603,276 and 474,200.
   _Oklahoma, 68,250 and 85,565.
   _South Dakota, 234,190 and 407,980.
   _Texas, 1,152,185 and 1,047,791.
   _Wyoming, 379,113 and 474,863.

   Consumer and business interest rates are
unlikely to go lower in coming weeks despite political pressure on
the Federal Reserve to abandon its tight-money policy, private
economists say.
   These analysts are forecasting that the prime lending rate
offered by banks will stay at 10 percent, where it has been since
early January.
   The prime rate is used by many banks as the benchmark in setting
about half of their business and consumer loans, including
adjustable-rate home equity loans.
   Mortgage rates, which are currently averaging 10.26 percent
nationally for fixed-rate loans, will remain close to that level at
least until fall, when they might start falling slightly, analysts
say.
   This forecast is based on an assumption that Federal Reserve
officials, who were in Washington today to set monetary strategy,
will decide that inflationary risks make it unwise to reduce
interest rates further.
   ``The economy is growing, although weakly, while at the same
time inflation is unacceptably high. We have a tug of war between
those two factors and that will produce no change'' by the central
bank, Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said Monday.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a
government securities dealer, said that while there were
indications that economic growth is rebounding and inflationary
pressures are moderating, it is too soon for the Fed to know for
sure that these favorable developments are occurring.
   ``The Fed is going to have to wait for at least a couple of
months to get a true reading on where the economy is right now,''
Jones said. ``For that reason, I see no change coming out of this
meeting.''
   Federal Reserve policymakers, including board members in
Washington and presidents of Fed regional banks, meet eight times a
year behind closed doors to review the economy and revise their
interest rate targets.
   Private economists said they believed the central bank would
stand firm against Bush administration pressure to move quickly to
reduce interest rates as a way of boosting economic growth.
   The Fed last eased credit conditions just before Christmas and
has resisted repeated urgings by the administration to make further
changes.
   A published report earlier this month quoted an unnamed
presidential adviser as saying President Bush was ``mad as hell''
and would not reappoint Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board next year because of Greenspan's refusal to heed
pleas for a looser credit policy.
   As the year began, many analysts were looking for quick action
by the Fed to lower interest rates in an effort to keep the country
out of a recession, given the fact that the economy in the final
three months of 1989 had turned in its poorest performance in three
years.
   However, business activity picked up early this year, leading
Greenspan to say that he believed the danger point for a recession
had passed.
   Also working against a looser credit policy is the fact that
inflationary pressures increased significantly in recent months,
driven upward by crop-killing freezes and a spurt in energy costs.
   In addition to domestic concerns over inflation and growth, the
Fed is keeping an eye on international markets, where the dollar
has been climbing, especially against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar's strength so far this year concerns the
administration and is one reason the White House has been
pressuring the Fed to lower interest rates.
   Lower U.S. interest rates serve to push down the dollar's value
because they mean lower profits for foreign investors. A lower
dollar improves America's trade fortunes because it makes U.S.
goods more competitive on overseas markets and raises the cost of
imports to American consumers.
   David Wyss, chief economist of DRI-McGraw Hill, said that while
he was not looking for any immediate action by the Fed, a small
move toward lowering interest rates could occur later this spring
if the central bank remains concerned about the dollar's strength.

   The government is appealing for
international help in dealing with a growing number of refugees _
mainly from Arab and African countries _ who have sought shelter in
Poland after being deported by Sweden.
   The refugees have topped 700 and are stretching the means of
municipal authorities in the Baltic port of Swinoujscie, the PAP
news agency said.
   The official news agency said the refugees first began arriving
by ferry from Sweden on Thursday and that at least 300 had been
denied entry by that country. It said Poland's government has
appealed to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva for
advice on how to deal with the situation.
   Elzbieta Piela-Mielczarek, the mayor of Swinoujscie, also sent a
cable to the commissioner appealing for assistance because the city
does not have the means to provide basic care, PAP said.
   The Polish government, in the midst of implementing radical
economic reforms that are seriously taxing the Polish people, has
nevertheless decided to grant funds to take care of the refugees
and has assured them free medical treatment, the agency reported.
   Television showed pictures of the refugees, including children
huddled with their baggage. The report also showed refugees in
Swedish buses that were loaded onto a ferry. It said some refugees
were not allowed out of the buses during the 20-hour trip across
the Baltic.
   ``Here at least is democracy,'' one refugee said in the
television report. Most of the refugees hid their faces from the
television camera, however.
   ``We escaped from Lebanon because there is war,'' one teen-age
girl said.
   The Polish government has ordered border officials to check the
documents of foreigners boarding ferries in the city of Swinoujscie
to see if they have valid entry visas for Sweden, PAP said.
   Forged Swedish visas can be bought in Poland on the black market
from Arabs for $200 to $2,000, according to the television report.
   Many of the refugees have run out of money, PAP said. About 300
of the refugees were being lodged at vacation homes belonging to
two power plants, and another 400 were being housed in private
homes, the agency said.
   Over the weekend, Jacek Piechota, a parliamentary deputy from
the port of Szczecin, about 50 miles south of Swinoujscie, appealed
to Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki to take action to resolve the
situation.

   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' director Bruce
Beresford was the ``forgotten man'' when they handed out the Oscar
nominations, but he got his share of accolades from others honored
for their work on the film.
   Academy Award ceremony host Billy Crystal was the first to
lament the absence of an Oscar nomination for Beresford, whose film
was the most honored of the night, with four statuettes.
   In his opening comedy routine, Crystal called ``Miss Daisy'' as
``the movie that apparently directed itself.''
   Crystal's comments were met with steady applause.
   When ``Miss Daisy'' won its first award, for makeup, winner Lynn
Barber said in her acceptance speech, ``I'd also like to
acknowledge Bruce Beresford.'' Again, the audience applauded.
   Jessica Tandy, who won for best actress for ``Miss Daisy,''
called Beresford, ``that forgotten man, my director.''
   Similar sentiments were expressed by Alfred Uhry when he picked
up the screenplay statuette for adapting his own
Pulitzer-prizewinng play, and by Richard Zanuck, accepting the
best-picture award for ``Miss Daisy.''
   In a similar gesture, presenter Kim Basinger made no secret of
her disdain for the Academy's snub of Spike Lee's ``Do the Right
Thing,'' a much-admired story of racial prejudice.
   ``We have five great films here,'' Miss Basinger said as she
introduced the first of the films nominated for best picture. ``And
they are great for one reason: they tell the truth.
   ``But there is one film missing from this list that deserves to
be honored because, ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of
all. And that's `Do the Right Thing.'''
   As her remarks were met with applause. Miss Basinger thrust both
clenched fists into the air, shouting ``Yes!''
   Director Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' landed on 81 film
critics' Top 10 lists, but received just two nominations, for
original screenplay and supporting actor for Danny Aiello.
   Anton Furst won an Academy Award for his art direction of
``Batman.'' The film is the third most popular in box-office
history, but received just one nomination.
   Jack Nicholson, who co-starred as the Joker in the film, was
overlooked in the best supporting actor competition.
   ``For me to be here in front of Jack Nicholson ... and we were
the ones who got it,'' Furst said backstage. ``I must say it was
quite embarrassing.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet soldiers on Tuesday began
rounding up Lithuanians who fled the Red Army, raiding hospitals
where the men sought refuge after the republic's declaration of
independence from Moscow.
   Witnesses said some of the young men were beaten as they were
taken from a decaying psychiatric hospital in Vilnius. A trail of
blood led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital.
   It was the first reported violence in the confrontation between
Lithuania and the Kremlin that began March 11 with the Baltic
republic's attempt to withdraw from the union.
   Soviet troops also took over the Communist Party headquarters, a
showcase office building in the center of the Lithuanian capital.
It was the fifth party building Soviet forces had seized in recent
days.
   Before dawn, paratroopers took about two dozen men into custody
at a psychiatric hospital in Vilnius, sharply escalating tensions
that officials said Monday seemed to be easing with the opening of
talks between Soviet military and republic officials.
   A police officer in Kaunas, about 65 miles to the west, said by
telephone that Soviet troops had taken control of the Red Cross
hospital there, which had served as a second sanctuary for
deserters.
   The police officer, who did not identify himself, said the
soldiers were not allowing Lithuanian police to enter the grounds
of the hospital. It was not immediately known if anyone was taken
into custody there.
   A Lithuanian Interior Ministry official said a third hospital,
in a small town outside, also was raided and that two or three
former soldiers were taken away peacefully.
   Soviet military authorities had warned they would seize the men
they considered deserters if the men did not return voluntarily by
last Saturday. The Lithuanian government contends the Red Army is
an army of occupation.
   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 _
along with the other two Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia.
   Independence movements have also sprung up in Latvia, Estonia
and other Soviet republics, posing one of the biggest challenges to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev since he came to power in 1985.
   The actions came after Gorbachev told Sen. Edward Kennedy on
Monday that he would not use force in Lithuania _ except to save
lives.
   In Vilnius, a nurse said about a dozen of the men who had been
staying at the hospital escaped and that others were beaten by
their captors.
   ``They beat them with their fists,'' a duty nurse said of the
Soviet soldiers who broke into the hospital about 3 a.m.. She
refused to give her name. ``I was afraid they would shoot me too.''
   The Interior Ministry official, who did not give his name, and a
Lithuanian journalist said two Lithuanian policemen also were
beaten by the soldiers when they sought to intervene to stop the
violence.
   A television crew from the American ABC News network arrived at
the scene while the troops were still there, was held at gunpoint
and forced to surrender its video tape.
   ``They held us at gunpoint and told us not to move,'' said
Andrzej Lewandowski, a member of the camera crew. His colleague,
Chris Burzynski, said the soldiers made them take all their
equipment out of their car and seized all their video cassettes.
   Lithuania's president, Vytautas Landsbergis, suggested Saturday
that the deserters seek sanctuary in churches instead of the
hospitals. But few if any youths appeared to accept the proposal.
   Some Lithuanian leaders said Monday that talks that began the
previous day with Soviet military commanders had eased tensions in
the breakaway republic, but others were not so optimistic.
   Lithuanian Deputy Premier Romualdas Ozolas, one of two officials
who met two Soviet military officers Monday, told reporters:
``After coming out of this meeting, I can say the mood has
changed.''
   ``It is evident the conflict will not be escalated,'' he said.
   But President Landsbergis was more skeptical. He said he had not
received clear assurances that no more buildings would be occupied.
   Moreover, in a separate interview with the U.S. National Public
Radio, Landsbergis said the situation had become ``very dangerous''
in the light of Gorbachev's remarks to Kennedy.
   ``Before, he always said that he would not use force in
Lithuania, but now we have a situation where he's qualifying that
statement and setting a condition under which he could use force.''
   Soviet television said Monday that Soviet helicopters have been
patrolling Lithuania's borders daily because of reports
``territorial guard forces'' set up by the popular independence
movement Sajudis have been erecting border signs.
   Paratroopers appeared in Vilnius on Sunday at the Higher Party
School and the Institute of Marxism-Leninism. Lithuanian officials
said there also were soldiers at the Vilnius Communist Party
headquarters.
   Ozolas said that during the talks, the army said it occupied the
buildings at the request of Lithuanian Communists who remain loyal
to Moscow. The majority of the party split with Moscow in December.
   Reports in Vilnius on Monday night said paratroopers had
occupied another building, the Communist Party committee's
headquarters in the port of Klaipeda, 200 miles northwest of
Vilnius.
   Lithuanian journalist and activist Vilus Kavalauskas told
reporters the paratroopers had arrived in response to a request by
Klaipeda's assistant party chief. Kavalauskas did not say when the
building was seized.
   A helicopter dropped leaflets on Vilnius urging people to attend
an anti-independence rally Tuesday outside Parliament. One set of
leaflets was unsigned, while another was signed by ``USSR citizens
in Lithuania.'' The republic of 3.8 million has a large Russian
minority.
   ``They are pushing the Lithuanian people into an abyss of
independence,'' the leaflets warned. ``Think! Will we be free in
this `free state' where the right to own property is given again
into alien hands?''
   Kennedy said Gorbachev told him he was committed to solving the
dispute with Lithuania peacefully and only would use troops if
lives were in danger.
   Speaking to a news conference after the meeting, Kennedy said
the Soviet leader ``indicated to me that the position of the Soviet
Union was that there would be no use of force unless the lives of
others were threatened, and that he was committed to a peaceful
resolution.''
   Gorbachev did not say whether he thought any threat to human
life was imminent in Lithuania, the Massachusetts Democrat reported.
   At Monday's talks in Vilnius, Ozolas and Lithuanian Interior
Minister Marijonas Misiukonis met with Col. Viktor Smokarev, deputy
chief of the Vilnius military garrison, and Col. Vladimir Trikoz of
the Interior Ministry.
   They agreed not to take any steps affecting security without
first informing the other side, Ozolas told reporters.
   Last week, Gorbachev ordered Lithuanians to turn in all firearms
and on Thursday he told them to stop signing up for volunteer
military units and threatened to round up Soviet army deserters.

   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the heartwarming
story of a crotchety Jewish widow and her friendship with a patient
black chauffeur, won the Oscar as best picture Monday and captured
the top acting prize for Jessica Tandy. Its total of four awards
made it the year's most-honored film.
   Daniel Day-Lewis was named best actor for his role in ``My Left
Foot'' as Christy Brown, who battled cerebral palsy to become an
acclaimed artist. Brenda Fricker, who played his devoted mother,
won the best supporting actress award.
   Oliver Stone was honored at the 62nd annual Academy Awards as
best director for ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' the story of a
Vietnam soldier's transformation from bitter paraplegic to anti-war
activist. It was the second such prize in three years for Stone,
who also won for the 1986 anti-Vietnam epic ``Platoon.''
   ``My deepest thanks for your acknowledgment that Vietnam is not
over, though some people say it is,'' said Stone.
   For the first time since 1981, the directing award did not go
for the year's best picture. Bruce Beresford, who directed ``Miss
Daisy,'' was not even nominated, an omission that was commented on
frequently during the presentations.
   ``We're up here for one simple reason,'' said Richard Zanuck,
who produced ``Miss Daisy'' with his wife, Lili. ``And that's the
fact that Bruce Beresford is a brilliant director.''
   Denzel Washington, the runaway slave turned soldier in
``Glory,'' won the best supporting actor award.
   ``My son said he was going to make one of these out of clay for
me, now I've got a model for him,'' an exultant Washington said as
he held up his gold statuette, first award of the evening.
   ``I never expected in a million years that I would be in this
position. It's a miracle!'' said Miss Tandy, who at 80 becomes the
oldest performer to win an Oscar. The slender, white-haired actress
received a standing ovation from the crowd that packed the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion of the Los Angeles Music Center.
   Day-Lewis had to overcome tough competition from ``Miss
Daisy's'' Morgan Freeman and ``Fourth of July's'' Tom Cruise to win
his Oscar.
   ``For everyone involved in the film, all our desire to make the
film, all the strength that we needed, all the pleasure that we
took in making the film came from Christy Brown,'' Day-Lewis said.
   ``I don't believe this!'' exclaimed the Dublin-born Miss Fricker
as she came on stage.
   She added her thanks to ``Christy Brown, just for being alive,
and to his mother, Mrs. Brown. Anybody who gives birth 22 times
deserves one,'' she said, referring to the Oscar.
   The awards were spread in unusually even fashion during the
3-hour, 34-minute show that was televised live on ABC-TV and
reached a worldwide audience estimated in advance at 1 billion.
   ``Miss Daisy'' also won for screenplay adaptation and makeup,
making it the night's leader. ``Glory,'' the inspirational story of
the first black regiment to fight in the Civil War, also won
trophies for cinematography and sound, to finish with three.
Besides the directing prize, ``Fourth of July'' won just one other
Oscar, for film editing.
   Washington becomes the fourth black performer to win an Oscar.
Previous black winners were Hattie McDaniel for ``Gone With the
Wind,'' in 1939 and Louis Gossett Jr. for ``An Officer and a
Gentleman'' in 1982, in supporting categories, and Sidney Poitier
for ``Lilies of the Field'' in 1963 as lead actor.
   Alfred Uhry, who adapted his own Pulitzer Prize-winning play,
won the screenplay adaptation award for ``Miss Daisy.'' Tom
Schulman, the author of ``Dead Poet's Society,'' won for best
original screenplay.
   The award for art direction went to ``Batman,'' the top
moneymaker of 1989 at $251 million that failed to win a nomination
in any other category. Another top box-office draw, ``Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade,'' picked up an Oscar for sound effects
editing. The Oscar for visual effects was given to the underwater
thriller ``The Abyss.''
   ``Henry V'' took the prize for costume design.
   Disney's much-praised animated fairy tale, ``The Little
Mermaid'' won two Oscars _ best song for the calypso ``Under the
Sea,'' and best original score.
   Italy's ``Cinema Paradiso,'' a reminiscence of growing up in a
Sicilian village, was named best foreign film.
   The announcement of the foreign film award came after a tortuous
satellite feed from Moscow where Jack Lemmon and Soviet actress
Natalya Negoda rattled off the nominees with a triple echo coming
though the sound system.
   Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, director of such classics as
``Rashomon'' and ``The Seven Samurai,'' was awarded an honorary
Oscar. In his acceptance speech the aging master struck a humble
note, saying ``I really don't feel yet that I have grasped the
essence of cinema.''
   The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was given to veteran
producer-director Howard Koch.
   Comedian Billy Crystal, host for the festivities, drew laughs as
he came on stage with a reference to last year's widely panned
opening dance sequence between actor Rob Lowe and a life-size fairy
tale heroine. Acknowledging the hearty applause, he asked: ``Is
that for me or are you just glad I'm not Snow White?''
   Besides the references to Beresford, another dig at the
nominating judgment of academy members came from ``Batman'' costar
Kim Basinger. Introducing clips from one of the year's best picture
nominees, she criticized the omission of Spike Lee's ``Do the Right
Thing'' from that list.
   ``There is one film missing from this list that deserves to be
on it because, ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of
all,'' Miss Basinger said of Lee's hard-hitting story of racial
intolerance.

   Monday night's show marked the first time the Oscars have gone
truly international. Besides the announcements at the Music Center,
envelopes were sent to entertainers for unsealing in four other
cities:
   Art direction by Glenn Close and Mel Gibson in London; foreign
language film by Jack Lemmon and Russian actress Netalya Negoda in
Moscow; sound and sound effects editing by Bryan Brown and Rachel
Ward in Sydney; documentaries and shorts by Charlton Heston and
Norma Aleandro in Buenos Aires.
   ``I looked at every awards show since 1955, and one thing stands
out: how much the Oscars reflect the times,'' said the show's
producer, Gilbert Cates. ``If you wanted to know the history of
1955, you could get a good impression from the show, including what
people wore, what their entertainment was, what was on their minds.
   ``When you consider all the changes that happened last year in
Europe and other parts of the world, it made sense to have a show
that reflected those changes.''
   A win for best picture brings not only glory to the filmmakers
but millions in revenue for the releasing company. Last year's
triumph, ``Rain Man,'' provides an example. Reports Barry Lorie,
MGM-UA marketing chief:
   ``On the week before the Oscars, `Rain Man' was playing in 1,542
theaters and grossed $3,003,521. On the week following the Oscars,
`Rain Man' played in 1,581 theaters and grossed $5,537,165. So it
earned $2.5 million more as a result of the Oscars.
   ``A best-picture Oscar is important in this country, but the
biggest effect can be felt overseas. It is vitally important in
selling a film in foreign countries.''
   Richard Zanuck, co-producer of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' agrees:
``Being able to advertise `winner of the Academy Award for best
picture' is a tremendous boost overseas, also in the videocassette
and other markets.
   ``Even the nominations gave `Miss Daisy' a tremendous boost. And
we were ready if our picture won the award; 300 more theaters were
added this week.''

<HEAD>Phnom Penh Gains Confidence After Battlefield Victories, May not
Compromise</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vietnam-backed government,
having passed a crucial battlefield test, appears more entrenched
domestically and may make fewer compromises in negotiations to end
the 11-year-old civil war.
   The avowed September pullout of Vietnam's forces left the
untested and jittery Phnom Penh government facing a three-party
guerrilla coalition that includes the powerful Khmer Rouge.
   Initially, the Chinese-armed guerrillas made headway in
northwest Cambodia. But as the monsoon season approaches, signaling
a slowdown in fighting, the tide appears to have turned.
   The Khmer Rouge has failed to take the northwest's major city,
Battambang. The U.S.-backed Khmer People's National Liberation
Front is suffering sharp setbacks, and troops loyal to overall
coalition chief Prince Norodom Sihanouk have yet to make
significant gains.
   Although Vietnam's reinvolvement is denied by Phnom Penh, the
change of fortune appears at least in part to have been due to the
return of some Vietnamese troops. This has not, however, detracted
from the confidence evident among Cambodian government officials.
   ``I think they're feeling pretty good about themselves. They've
surprised themselves,'' said one Western aid official who requested
anonymity. ``They're concerned about the future, but they think
they have compromised as much as they will, can and need to.''
   Knowledgeable diplomats caution about predictions for this
volatile, tragic country, but sketch one possible scenario that
sees Phnom Penh trying, while coping with the civil war, to slowly
improve economic conditions and deepen political control.
Eventually, it would gain international recognition and aid.
   Few nations now recognize Phnom Penh, but lower-level contacts
have intensified. In recent months, Phnom Penh has hosted British
and Australian officials as well as former U.S. Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie, who called for changes in Washington's hostile
policy toward Indochina.
   Officials in this capital deny military successes will harden
their stance at the conference table, saying the draining ``half
war, half peace'' that exists is unacceptable.
   ``Look around you at this rundown country,'' said Pong Peng
Cheng, a senior advisor to Prime Minister Hun Sen. ``How can you
have development when war remains the top priority, when 40 to 50
percent of the budget goes to the military?''
   To date, round after round of negotiations _ in Paris, Jakarta
and Bangkok _ have failed despite a stack of peace plans and active
participation by the world's major powers.
   A major obstacle to peace is the future role of the Khmer Rouge,
widely detested for its 1975-78 reign of terror when hundreds of
thousands of people were killed. But non-Cambodian diplomats
involved in the negotiations also say leaders of the warring
parties, including Hun Sen and Sihanouk, are wary of making
concessions that could dissipate the power they now wield.
   Each leadership group, the diplomats say, is gauging whether it
could win a free election or a tussle for power in Phnom Penh
should some kind of political solution be reached.
   The Hun Sen government would have major handicaps at the polls.
It is communist in a country which has suffered the most radical of
communist revolutions. It is tainted by growing corruption, which
is admitted by officials and criticized with increasing vehemence
by ordinary Cambodians.
   On the positive side, the government follows liberal economic
policies and last year allowed peasants to own plots of land.
Recent rice harvests have been good, with Western aid sources
estimating the country will face a 30,000-ton food deficit in 1990
_ far less than in the earlier years.
   Un Buntha, a vice director in the planning ministry, said that
despite the continuing conflict, Cambodia's gross national product
increased by an estimated nine percent last year and further growth
was anticipated.
   But he admitted that the outside investment needed to revive
Cambodia's shattered infrastructure was not forthcoming. ``The
foreigners are hesitating because they are afraid of the war and we
do not yet have regulations and guarantees for investors,'' he said
in an interview.
   A major Phnom Penh asset may be its enemy. ``If it wasn't for
the Khmer Rouge, this government would have a very hard time
mobilizing the people. But with them out there, they don't need
much more,'' said an international aid agency official.
   The war, however, exacts a hefty price which may move the
government towards political compromise. Observers say the mass
conscription of young men, the villages of widows and hospitals
full of children maimed by mines may stoke hatred for the Khmer
Rouge and its allies but it also creates bitterness against the
Phnom Penh side.

<HEAD>Sasser Says Pentagon Renovation Out of the Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a Senate panel on military
construction says the Bush administration may as well forget about
spending $1.1 billion to renovate the Pentagon.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., acknowledged Monday that the
47-year-old building needs work but said the administration's call
for $1.1 billion over seven years runs counter to a tide of
shrinking budgets.
   ``The military construction bill is going to get smaller not
larger,'' Sasser told Pentagon officials at a Senate hearing.
``There's simply no room for such an undertaking.''
   The chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on
military construction faulted past defense secretaries for failing
to get the General Services Administration to provide sufficient
funds for the building's upkeep.
   The GSA owns the Pentagon building, with transfer of control to
the Defense Department expected some time this year.
   The Pentagon, the largest office building in the world, has 17.5
miles of corridors, 131 stairways, 19 escalators and 13 elevators,
and covers 29 acres in northern Virginia.

<HEAD>94 Percent of Business Leaders Oppose National Health Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An overwhelming majority of the nation's
business leaders oppose a government-run national health plan,
according to a poll commissioned by the Health Insurance
Association of America.
   The Roper Organization poll released Monday found that 94
percent of the business executives surveyed would reject a
health-care system with a budget controlled by the states or the
federal government.
   A majority of the executives, 62 percent, said they favored
improving private-sector efforts to control health-care costs and
relying on the current level of government regulation, while 31
percent said they would favor more government regulation to control
physician and hospital prices.
   Two-thirds of the executives said that in the last year their
corporate health care costs rose by 11 percent to 20 percent; one
in six said their costs were up 21 percent to 30 percent.
   The poll also found that nine of 10 business leaders have made
major changes in their health plans over the last two to three
years to contain costs.
   The most popular option, chosen by three-quarters of them, was
to shift more of the cost to employees by increasing deductibles
and co-payments and the workers' share of premiums. Also, 62
percent said they have adopted managed care programs, such as those
based on health maintenance organizations and referred provider
organizations.

<HEAD>Administration Hails Elections in Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says the results of
Hungary's first free parliamentary elections in more than four
decades is a positive step for democracy.
   ``We are encouraged by the elections as an indication of further
movement along the path of democratic development for the Hungarian
people,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday.
   Partial results of the weekend election indicated voters
overwhelmingly chose opposition candidates over Communist
reformers, and that it appeared likely that a coalition of
opposition parties would run Hungary.
   Fitzwater noted that there was a tight contest between two
non-communist factions _ the conservative Hungarian Democratic
Forum and the liberal League of Free Democrats. The Socialists, the
successor to the Communists who once ruled the Warsaw Pact nation,
were trailing badly.
   ``Eastern Europe is undergoing dramatic economic and political
changes,'' Fitzwater said. ``Hungary has been one of the countries
in the forefront of these changes.''

<HEAD>Stocks Rebound, Dollar Continues To Climb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rebounded from
early losses and closed only marginally lower Tuesday, while the
dollar extended its climb against the Japanese yen to eight
consecutive trading days.
   The dollar closed at 156.96 yen, up 0.56 yen from Monday's
156.40-yen finish. It opened at 156.90 yen and ranged between
156.80 yen and 157.20 yen. The dollar gained 4.76 yen over eight
days.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average lost 14.53 points, or 0.05
percent, ending the day at 31,825.96. In the morning session, it
lost 346.71 points.
   ``Although the index opened higher this morning because today is
the start of a new fiscal year for majority of Japanese companies,
it soon fell back as market players lacked energy to continue
buying,'' said a dealer with Yamaichi Securities Co., who requested
anonymity.
   ``It's all because of the yen's decline,'' he added.
   Japan's fiscal year begins April 1, but the new month for stock
transaction starts four days prior to the calendar date.
   The dealer said the market appeared to bottom out when the index
dived below the 29,000-point mark last week, but it will take time
and continued ups and downs to recover even to the 33,000-point
mark.
   On Monday, the index gained 1,468.33 points, or 4.83 percent,
the second largest single-day gain ever. On March 19, the index
dived 1,353.20 points to begin a three-day plunge that took it
below 30,000 points before it began rebounding last Friday.
   Higher interest rates caused by the yen's weakness also dampened
interest in stocks, dealers said.
   The yield on the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond,
which rises when the price falls, rose to 7.255 percent from 7.17
percent Monday.
   The dollar remained strong despite dollar-selling by the Bank of
Japan and selling by investors who sought to take profits at the
157-yen level, said Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan
Securities Co.
   Traders said the central bank sold the dollar actively to try to
halt its rise, but the amount sold was not immediately available.
The Bank of Japan does not comment officially on its market
intervention.
   ``The decline in share prices in part contributed to the
yen-selling,'' Kanai added.
   ``The market now views the United States as allowing the current
dollar-yen rate, since the Fed took no immediate action even after
the Hashimoto-Brady meeting,'' he said.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady met over the weekend and confirmed they
would continue close coordination to maintain the stability of the
exchange market, but did not promise any steps to stop the dollar's
recent rise.
   ``Unless the United States shows a clear position on the
appropriate dollar level, the dollar won't stop rising,'' Kanai
added.
   Meanwhile, Hashimoto told a post-Cabinet meeting news conference
that events in Lithuania were probably having a great effect on the
exchange market. Political instability often increases demand for
dollars because of the perceived safety of U.S. investment.
   He called the current dollar-yen exchange rate ``a headache''
and said he was continuing to watch foreign exchange market
movements with concern.

<TEXT>
   Couch-bound bird watchers are entering
a new television season watching their favorite stars, two
peregrine falcons in the permanent eye of a cable channel's camera.
   The camera mounted on the 21st story of a downtown office
building clicked on again Monday, giving watchers a bird's eye view
of the falcon's nest.
   The falcons became TV stars last summer when the cable company
mounted a camera near their nest on a ledge of the 23-story Monarch
Place office building. The pictures were broadcast on a channel
devoted to educational programming.
   The show proved hugely popular with the cable outlet's 43,000
subscribers and this year systems in Westfield, Enfield, Longmeadow
and Northampton will also carry the falcons.
   Nobody else is using the public access channel, so it's entirely
for the birds.
   ``It amazes me that someone can sit and watch the birds hour
after hour,'' said Brian Lambert, general manager of Continental
Cablevision. ``I am one of them. It stays on in the office all day
long. We just kind of wait to see the bird move or the eggs or
whatever. It's mesmerizing.''
   Tom French, director of the state's endangered species program,
said the show is more than an entertaining glimpse of nature.
   ``It's an incredible opportunity,'' he said. ``It's absolutely
incredible that they're so visible.''
   ``We often joke around the office that we spend tens and
hundreds of thousands of dollars on new customer service features
or new programming services and almost as a second thought we
covered the peregrine falcons story and overnight it became an
instant success,'' Lambert said.
   Running cable to the building and mounting the camera behind
reflective glass cost about $10,000, Lambert said.
   Among the first season highlights were the first hatchings of
young peregrine falcons in western Massachusetts in 40 years and a
June thriller when French rappelled down the side of the building
to rescue a baby falcon that was choking on a piece of meat. Alert
viewers had noticed the chick's distress and called in the
situation to cable officials.
   This season, the first egg is expected to appear in early April,
the first hatching in mid-May and the first fledgling flights near
the end of June.
   The show could have a long run, because falcons mate for life
and generally return to their nests year after year, French said.

   A passenger bus skidded off a railroad
overpass in eastern India and fell onto high-voltage electrical
lines, killing at least 41 people and injuring about 20, news
agencies reported today.
   United News of India said the bus caught fire after hitting the
power lines Monday night near Kharagpur in West Bengal state, 780
miles east of New Delhi. The town is 70 miles from the state
capital of Calcutta.
   United News said 41 people were killed and 21 injured. Press
Trust of India said 50 people were killed and 22 injured.
   Press Trust said the crash was one of India's worst bus
accidents and only skeltons of the victims remained in the
completely burned vehicle.
   It said train service on the affected tracks, one of the busiest
in the state, was temporarily suspended.
   The bus was carrying 72 people, Press Trust said.

   The producers of the Oscar-winning ``Driving
Miss Daisy'' wasted no time bringing up The Big Snub.
   ``We're up here for really one very simple reason and that's the
fact that Bruce Beresford is a brilliant director,'' co-producer
Richard D. Zanuck said as he accepted best-picture honors Monday
night. ``It's as simple as that.''
   The movie, an account of a growing friendship between a white
Southern widow and her black chauffeur, won four awards, but
Beresford wasn't even nominated for the directing honor.
   It's a fact nobody watching the 62nd annual Academy Awards was
allowed to forget.
   Jessica Tandy, claiming the actress statuette for her lead role
in ``Miss Daisy,'' called Beresford, ``that forgotten man, my
director.''
   Host Billy Crystal quipped that ``Miss Daisy'' was ``the movie
that apparently directed itself.''
   Beresford was unavailable to comment on the flap. He was out of
the country after finishing a film in Nigeria.
   Beresford, born and raised in Australia, was nominated in 1980
for co-writing the screenplay for ``Breaker Morant'' and in 1984
for directing ``Tender Mercies.''
   Before making his mark in the United States with ``Tender
Mercies,'' Beresford established himself as a leading Australian
director with ``Don's Party,'' ``The Getting of Wisdom,'' ``The
Club'' and ``Puberty Blues.''
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' released by Warner Bros., won the
screenplay Oscar for Alfred Uhry, who adapted his own Pulitzer
Prize-winning play. It also won the award for makeup.
   Zanuck's co-producer is his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck.
   Made for $7.5 million, the film has grossed $74.5 million in 15
weeks of release.
   Backstage at the Oscars, David Zanuck said he couldn't
understand why Beresford was bypassed in the nominations.
   ``He had his stamp on this film,'' Zanuck said. ``Why he wasn't
nominated, we'll never know.''

<TEXT>
   Abortion rights activists are threatening
Gov. Cecil Andrus with severe economic consequences for his state
if he signs the restrictive state abortion law to be planted on his
desk today.
   ``They're organizing all over,'' said Gwen Dempsey, a Republican
state Senate candidate in Michigan who was meeting with Andrus
today. She and others have been trying to generate a boycott of
Idaho potatoes if Andrus refuses to veto the bill banning abortion
as a means of birth control.
   ``Women can put a stop to it now by using their pocketbooks and
make it a dead issue,'' Ms. Dempsey said.
   The abortion bill was to reach Andrus' desk today but he wasn't
expected to act immediately.
   Once the Legislature adjourns, by week's end, Andrus will have
10 days to make a decision. If he decides not to act on the bill,
it becomes law and would still take effect July 1.
   On Monday, Andrus made his first public comments on the bill
since it cleared the Legislature last Thursday. The Democratic
governor acknowledged the boycott threats and the mounting pressure
from both sides.
   ``This issue has a tendency to polarize people more than
anything I have seen,'' Andrus said. ``I don't enjoy the threat of
a boycott. But that type of reactionary measure is normal in cases
like this. I would hope it wouldn't generate that much steam or
interest.''
   Anti-abortion senators have said they have been receiving calls
and letters from their supporters, pledging to buy more Idaho
potatoes.
   But despite his longstanding opposition to abortion except in
cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, Andrus
said he had not decided yet whether to sign or veto the bill.
   ``It's a major piece of legislation that cannot be looked on
lightly,'' the governor said, announcing he would consult
unidentified outside experts.
   The legislation would ban abortion except in cases involving a
threat to the woman's life or physical health; severe fetal
deformity; incest if the victim is under 18, and nonstatutory rape
reported within seven days.
   Based on a National Right to Life Committee model rejected by
other states as too restrictive, it carries civil penalties against
doctors performing illegal abortions.
   Abortion rights advocates said the bill is unconstitutional and
have promised an immediate legal challenge should it become law.
That would give anti-abortion forces the court test they want of
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.
   Since the bill's approval last week, pro-choice activists have
been holding nightly candlelight vigils outside the Capitol.

<HEAD>Contra Disbanding in Doubt As Rebels Stream Across Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the ink barely dry on a Contra
promise to disband by mid-April, U.S.-backed rebels have streamed
into Nicaragua and their military leader says they won't disarm
until the Sandinista army does.
   ``We are speaking of total demobilization _ that includes both
ourselves and the Sandinistas,'' rebel military chief, Israel
Galeano, said Monday.
   International observers said there appeared a split among the
Contras over the pact signed Friday in Honduras. Rebel loyalty
seemed divided between Oscar Sovalbarro, a commander who signed the
agreement, and Galeano, who did not.
   The Sandinistas, defeated at the polls last month, have said
they won't hand over control of the army and police to the new
government headed by Violeta Chamorro until the U.S.-backed rebels
turn in their weapons.
   There were reports of intensified fighting and, In Washington,
the State Department asked the United Nations to increase the
number of observers it is sending to the region to so tensions can
be kept at a minimum.
   The 200-member force is to monitor the disbanding of the Contras
and tranfer of power from the long-ruling leftist Sandinista's to
Mrs. Chamorro's victorious alliance.
   Representatives of Mrs. Chamorro negotiated Friday's accord,
which says Contras in Honduran camps will demobilize by April 20,
five days before the conservative coalition takes office.
   But the agreement sets no deadline for disbanding rebels on
Nicaraguan territory, now at least half the 12,000-man Contra army.
   Galeano said it was unrealistic to expect immediate
demobilization.
   ``An eight-year process cannot be decided by the dismantling of
an organization in 15 days,'' he said.
   Most of the Contra army that set up camps in Honduras after U.S.
military aid ended in 1988 began returning to Nicaragua in
September. As many as 4,000 were believed in Nicaragua by the Feb.
25 elections.
   Sovalbarro, who negotiated the accord for the Contras, said
Monday that an ``insurgent military contingent of 2,000 rebel
fighters'' has returned since Friday and ``its numbers could
increase at any moment.''
   Contra bases across the border in Yamales, Honduras, are
practically empty, according to journalists and international
observers.
   They ``have become ghost camps. There's just a few of them left
there,'' one international observer said on condition of anonmity.
   Friday's accord also calls for an immediate cease-fire, a
provision the Sandinistas say the Contras have already violated.
   The Defense Ministry said that on Friday, a dozen soldiers and
four rebels were killed when 100 Contras ambushed Sandinista
troops. Mrs. Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, condemned the attack
as ``terrorism'' and insisted the Contra's disband ``without fail
and without pretext.''
   The ministry also reported a 30-minute firefight between
soldiers and rebels on Sunday. It said that on the same day 100
Contras seized a truck, robbed the passengers of cash and jewelry
and demanded the owner pay a $500 ransom.
   Sovalbarro denied there had been any fighting.
   ``It is totally false,'' he said. ``It was made up to fit the
interests of the Sandinistas.''
   Sovalbarro said rebel fighters inside Nicaragua were under
orders to ``avoid combat, but maintain their positions.''
   All clashes took place near the provincial capital of Jinotega,
100 miles northeast of Managua on the Honduran border. Jinotega
province is the northern tip of a corridor used by the Contras to
infiltrate Nicaragua.
   Whether or not the rebels disband by the April deadline appears
to depend on which Contra leader is talking.
   While Galeano insists on bilateral disarmament, some field
commanders say they will hand over their guns as soon as the United
Nations team arrives. Both Galeano and Sovalbarro deny any
differences between them.
   ``The agreement reached with the new government of Nicaragua
surprised our combatants at first,'' Sovalbarro said. ``But now we
are all happy over what happened.''
   Should there be a split, one international observer said Galeano
would command the loyalty of about 60 percent of fighters while 40
percent would follow Sovalbarro.
   The demobilization pact says the Contras inside Nicaragua will
move into ``secure zones'' monitored by the United Nations and
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the archbishop of Managua.
   A United Nations team is gathering in Nicaragua and another is
already in Honduras.

   The federal government didn't really want
Banjo to stand up and be counted, but somehow the cat did get a
census form.
   The pet's name was included on the mailbox of Steve and Carole
Shanks when census workers went door-to-door in 1988 to identify
rural route addresses.
   That may be why the couple's census form was addressed to their
5-year-old cat, the Census Bureau said.
   Bill Mullins, assistant manager of field operations for the
Indianapolis office of the Census Bureau, said the name on the form
is unimportant.
   The incorrect name should be, ugh, scratched out _ and the form

<TEXT>
   The leader of a 3{-year-old armed
insurrection in this South American country was arrested after a
shootout with soldiers in which two of his security guards were
killed, the military said.
   Ronny Brunswijk, leader the Jungle Commando guerilla group, was
arrested Monday on drug charges and was being held at an army post
in the capital of Paramaribo, military spokesman Borger Breeveld
said on state television.
   Breeveld said the charges were related to Brunswijk's
announcement Sunday that his men had seized more than a ton of
unrefined cocaine from four Colombians forced by bad weather to
land their plane near one of his bases.
   Breeveld did not say where Brunswijk was arrested, but it was
believed to have been somewhere in the capital, where the guerrilla
leader had been since Friday for talks on ending the Jungle
Commando insurgency.
   The spokesman said two of Brunswijk's security guards were
killed when they tried to intervene and an unspecified number of
Brunswijk's aides taken into custody.
   The peace talks had broken off over Brunswijk's demands for
continued authority in the jungle interior of this former Dutch
colony. His guerrilla group has found support among descendants of
African slaves who live in the interior and comprise about 50,000
of the country's 400,000 population.
   Officials said President Ransewak Shankar dispatched Minister of
Justice Jules Ajodhia and Deputy Vice President Willy Soemita to
army headquarters to discuss the arrest with the army general
staff, leading to speculation the government had not been consulted
beforehand.
   Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, the armed forces commander and former
ruler of Suriname, has opposed a tentative peace agreement reached
in June on the grounds it failed to disarm the Jungle Commando,
which is believed to number between 200 and 400 men.
   Brunswijk is a former bodyguard of Bouterse.

   Jailed as an army deserter in Cuba, the Mariel
refugee charged with setting the nightclub fire that killed 87
people was described as a street hustler who recently lost his job
and girlfriend.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was moved Monday from the Rikers Island jail
to the psychiatric ward at Kings County Hospital, where he was
under a suicide watch, said Ruby Ryles, a spokeswoman for the city
Corrections Department.
   Gonzalez, charged with murdering 87 people by torching the Happy
Land Social Club early Sunday, had no prior criminal record.
   Gonzalez told immigration officials when he arrived in the
United States in 1980 that he had portrayed himself as a drug
trafficker to Cuban authorities in order to get kicked out of Cuba,
Duke Austin, a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, told The New York Times.
   There was no evidence Gonzalez was involved with drugs here,
officials said.
   U.S. officials have complained that many of the 125,000 people
kicked out of Cuba in the boatlift had criminal records or mental
disorders. Others were simply dissatisfied with life in Cuba.
   Gonzalez reportedly lost his last job, at a lamp factory, about
six months ago. Detective James Malvey said Gonzalez since had
hustled money washing cars and peddling.
   For the past three months Gonzalez has lived in an $80-a-week
furnished room in the Bronx. Before that he had lived with
45-year-old Lydia Feliciano.
   ``He was just a normal guy,'' said Ray Davis, the building
manager. ``He's a nice, quiet, clean guy.''
   Gonzalez allegedly told police he torched the club after
quarreling with Ms. Feliciano.
   Franco Mena, who showed up at the club after the fire, said he
and another man prevailed on Ms. Feliciano to identify Gonzalez as
the arsonist. ``She didn't want to talk because she thought nobody
had heard her argument,'' Mena said.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez's shoes
still reeked of gasoline when he was arrested at his apartment 12
hours after the fire.
   According to immigration records, Gonzalez arrived in the United
States at Key West, Fla., on May 31, 1980, as part of the Mariel
boatlift.
   He was detained at Camp McCoy, Wis., then Fort Chaffee, Ark.,
until Feb. 21, 1981, when he was released, said Verne Jervis of the
immigration service.
   He was sent to live with a sponsor family in New York. The
agency that handled that placement said it was still looking for
Gonzalez' records.
   Gonzalez told federal officials that he was in a Cuban prison
from 1971 to 1974 for desertion. But that account had not been
confirmed, officials said.
   Jervis said Gonzalez had never applied for permanent residence,
which makes him deportable after doing time for a criminal offense.

   ``Pretty Woman,'' the latest grownup film from
Disney, collected $11.3 million to head the list of top-grossing
movies last weekend.
   The thriller ``The Hunt for Red October,'' with Sean Connery as
a Soviet submarine commander, submerged to second place with $9.1
million after three weeks on top. The film so far has grossed $67.3
million.
   The Warner Bros. comedy ``Joe vs. the Volcano,'' starring Tom
Hanks in a love affair with Meg Ryan, cooled to finish third with
$5.3 million.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' winner of four Academy Awards on Monday
night, parked in fourth on the money list with $3.7 million, and
double-Oscar winner ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' hung on in
ninth with $1.3 million.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July'' were
the only non-debuting films in the Top 10 with an increase in
ticket sales. ``Daisy'' now has grossed $74.5 million and ``Born''
has racked up $65.4 million.
   New Line's ``House Party,'' an independently produced teen sex
comedy that finished in fifth place, took in $3.2 million to bring
its gross to $13.4 million. That was a resounding success because
the film is being shown on only 700 screens.
   The convent comedy ``Nuns on the Run,'' starring Eric Idle and
Robbie Coltrane as thieves with unusual habits, also continued to
play well in its second week of limited release, netting $800,000.
   ``Lord of the Flies'' was swatted to sixth place with $2.5
million in sales. ``Blue Steel,'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis as a
rookie cop with bad taste in men, finished seventh.
   ``Bad Influence,'' with Rob Lowe hurting the good guy, and
``Hard To Kill,'' with Steven Seagal hurting the bad guys, also saw
sales plunge and fell to eighth and tenth, respectively.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $11.3 million, 1,325 screens,
$8,514 per screen, $11.3 million, one week.
   2. ``The Hunt for Red October,'' Paramount, $9.1 million, 1,817

   Children with a deadly bone cancer
are being injected with microscopic, drug-carrying bubbles of fat
in hopes that the experimental therapy will work where chemotherapy
has failed, a researcher says.
   While it is too soon to tell if the strategy is working, some
early signs give encouragement, said Eugenie Kleinerman of the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.
   The approach may also help some day with other forms of cancer,
she said Monday at a science writers seminar sponsored by the
American Cancer Society.
   The patients in her study have osteosarcoma, a childhood bone
cancer that produces some 700 cases a year in the United States.
   The cancer is treated with surgery to remove the bone tumor,
plus chemotherapy to attack cancer cells that have spread elsewhere
in the body.
   Nonetheless, some 30 percent to 40 percent of patients die from
cancer that had spread to their lungs before surgery, Kleinerman
said.
   Her therapy is aimed at destroying microscopic tumors in the
lung by activating white cells called monocytes in the blood and
others called macrophages in lung tissue. When activated, these
cells kill cancerous cells, she said.
   The white cells can be turned on by a drug called muramyl
tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine, abbreviated as MTP-PE, she
said.
   The drug is enclosed in the tiny fat bubbles because monocytes
and macrophages readily digest them. Once devoured, a bubble spills
its load of MTP-PE, activating the cell to fight cancer.
   In this fashion, the drug can be delivered only to the desired
cells, which cuts down on side effects, Kleinerman said.
   The bubbles, called liposomes, are about the size of red blood
cells, she said.
   In mice, the strategy was able to eliminate cancer that had
spread to the lung, she said. It also worked in dogs, even without
help from chemotherapy, she said.
   The current study has so far enrolled 14 children for whom
chemotherapy has failed and whose cancers have spread to the lung.
   Participants have been getting liposomes bearing MTP-PE
intravenously twice a week as an outpatients for three months or
six months. An earlier study showed that side effects are minimal,
including fever and chills.
   Kleinerman said it is too early to see if the strategy is
working in the new study. But participants' lungs show dead cancer
cells and scar tissue around tumors, indicating that the treatment
is having some kind of effect, she said.
   If the liposome strategy does work, she said, she hopes it will
be combined with chemotherapy after the initial bone tumor is
removed. The idea is that the activated monocytes and macrophages
would kill cancer cells that resist the chemotherapy.
   She also said the strategy may pay off for other cancers that
spread to the lung, such as the skin cancer melanoma, or which
spread to the liver, such as colon cancer. Liposomes are taken up
by the liver and spleen as well as the lung, she said.
   Asked about prospects for treating lung cancer, she said she
knew of no studies of that possibility.
   John Weinstein of the National Cancer Institute, who has studied
liposomes, said previous studies give ``a good rationale for going
forward'' with the work Kleinerman is doing.

   A stunned neighborhood near the Bronx Zoo tried
to comprehend why many of its sons and daughters perished inside a
social club in the city's third worst fire.
   ``I told my son not to go there. He told me he wasn't going
there,'' said Eledia Alvarez, whose 22-year-old son Danny was one
of the 87 people who died in the fire early Sunday.
   Police cars and fire rescue trucks were still parked Monday near
the Happy Land Social Club, with its incongruous name and yellow
``happy face'' above a fire-blackened entrance and a single barred
window.
   Several hundred people loitering behind the blue police
sawhorses shook their heads or shrugged when asked if they knew
Julio Gonzalez, 36. He is alleged to have poured gasoline in the
doorway of the illegal nightspot and then set it afire, trapping
partyers in an upstairs dance area. Most suffocated before they
could flee down the two narrow stairways.
   Classes were underway as usual at Public School 67, which on
Sunday served as the clearing house for families and friends to
view police photographs of the victims. On Monday, a task force of
seven city, state and private agencies was still using part of the
building to help relatives make funeral arrangements.
   The city offered $900 to survivors who need burial assistance,
and the state Crime Victims Board will pay up to $2,500.
   Mrs. Alvarez was among some 200 relatives and friends who
returned for that purpose. They spoke with disgust about how the
Happy Land was able to operate despite having been ordered by city
authorities to close, and with sorrow that some people continued to
patronize it despite its reputation as an unsafe place.
   Rene J. Mena, 63, said his 30-year-old son, Rene Jr., the oldest
of 10 children and himself the father of three, had invited him to
go out on Saturday night.
   ``I told him I didn't want to go to that place. That is a very
dangerous place, and I'm not going there.''
   Rene Jr. died in the fire.

   Soviet troops left behind broken and
overturned iron bedsteads, scattered mattresses and a trail of
blood today after storming a hospital to arrest Lithuanians who
fled the Red Army.
   In the ward where about 36 deserters had been staying, a
soldier's wool hat with the Soviet army insignia torn off lay on
one cot. Two feet away, a half-eaten loaf of black bread rested on
a white sheet.
   Iron-barred windows were broken.
   A trail of blood led down the hospital steps and out the front
door.
   ``They beat them with their fists,'' a duty nurse at the
psychiatric hospital in Vilnius said. ``I was afraid they would
shoot me.''
   The hospital was one of at least two raided by Soviet troops
making good on Moscow's promise to arrest Lithuanian deserters who
hadn't returned to barracks by Saturday.
   After their government declared itself independent on March 11,
hundrds of young Lithuanians fled the Soviet army and many sought
refuge in the hospitals.
   The middle-aged nurse grew increasingly hysterical as she
recounted her story for reporters at the hospital after the
pre-dawn occupation.
   She said two truckloads of soldiers drove up to the hospital and
beat on the front door before being let in. She said they rushed up
the stairs to the second-floor ward where the young men were
staying, often surrounded in the daytime by Soviet and foreign
journalists.
   She said about two dozen men were beaten and taken away, while
another 12 were able to escape. Two Lithuanian policemen were also
beaten when they sought to intervene.
   An ABC television crew arriving at the scene was held at
gunpoint by soldiers and forced to surrender videotape.
   ``They told us not to move,'' said Andrzej Lewandowski, a member
of the news crew. His colleague, Chris Burzynski, said the soldiers
made them take all equipment out of their car and seized their
videocassettes.
   In Kaunas, about 65 miles west of the capital, Soviet soldiers
took over the Red Cross hospital, which served as a sanctuary set
up for the deserters by the Lithuanian government, a police officer
said.
   About 50 soldiers arrived in five trucks, said the officer, who
did not identify himself.
   ``They broke down doors and rousted all patients looking for
soldiers,'' he said. ``They asked all likely young men and wound up
taking two.''

   Atop the rickety wooden staircase, the dance
floor trembled under heels tapping and shuffling to the beat that
shifted from salsa to calypso. Disco lights glittered on silk
clothes, Saturday night's finest.
   Suddenly, flames roaring in the bottom floor turned the top room
into a blast furnace. Within seconds, superheated gases and thick
smoke had silenced the place. Only a handful had escaped.
   The $5 cover was a small price to pay for a night out in the
poor Latino community of East Tremont, near the Bronx Zoo. People
dressed up nice and they partied hard.
   ``The whole floor moved with the music, it was sleazy and very,
very hot,'' said Denise Garcia, 20. ``People liked to go there and
show off.''
   Lately, the patrons say, the mostly Honduran clientele had
expanded to include other Hispanics. Sometimes a gun or a knife
flashed, or someone whipped out a crack vial.
   Three of the victims played amateur soccer for a Bronx team
named after one of the big teams in Honduras, where many of the
youths hoped to return some day.
   ``They all dreamed of returning with more money, they were full
of Hispanic machismo,'' said their coach, Miguel Reyes.
   At about 3:15 a.m. Sunday, there was a ruckus downstairs in the
tiny entryway. A bearded Cuban patron was harassing his former
girlfriend who worked at the club, and a bouncer was called over.
   ``Don't push me, don't push me,'' the patron said, according to
witnesses. And then: ``I'll be back.''
   The man identified as Julio Gonzalez, 36, angered by his
rejection by ex-girlfriend Lydia Feliciano, fetched gasoline from a
service station, according to police.
   Then he stood at the club's exit and splashed the fuel on the
floor and wall inside. Then he struck a match.
   The Happy Land Social Club's name referred to America, regular
patrons said, a place of hope for the young immigrants who
frequented the club.
   When the fire allegedly lighted by Gonzalez took, fire
investigators said, the ground floor became an inferno; the
windowless second floor, where all but 18 of the 87 victims were
found, was a gas chamber, with wall-to-wall bodies.
   The few survivors included Ms. Feliciano; Gonzalez, under
suicide watch at a psychiatric ward, is charged with 87 murders.
   Long after dawn, a stream of corpses left the Happy Land on
stretchers, covered with white sheets.
   Some died instantly. Rescue workers told of finding victims with
glasses in their hands. Others were sitting at the bar, their legs
still wound around bar stools.
   ``Lungs are seared by hot gases, and it becomes impossible to
take a second breath,'' said Dr. Alexander Kuehl, director of
emergency medicine at New York Hospital. ``And when there is not
enough oxygen coming in to feed the fire, you get carbon monoxide,
which can kill you in a minute.''
   ``It was a huge rush of superheated poison gas. We call it a
flashover, it is instant. If you are breathing in, it is deadly,''
said Zachary Goldfarb, Emergency Medical Service deputy chief of
operations.
   Some victims, facing the wall of fire that came from downstairs,
frantically tried to escape. Bodies were piled four deep by the
upstairs door, a testament to their desperation.
   ``You can't imagine what went on in there; you can't imagine
what these people did to try to survive,'' said firefighter Dennis
Devlin.
   ``There was one woman who looked to be holding onto her
boyfriend for dear life,'' said Emergency Medical Services worker
Kerry Naughton, ``There was a man lying over a woman, as if he was
trying to shield her with his body.''
   There was no sprinkler system on the ground floor. The
sprinklers on the second floor discharged after 87 people were
dead, authorities said. Firefighters arrived in a few minutes, but
there were no screams, no cries.

   Two brothers pleaded innocent to
the shotgun slaying of their parents that police said was carried
out to obtain a $14 million inheritance.
   Erik Menendez, 19, and Lyle Menendez, 22, stood solemnly as they
entered their pleas before Municipal Court Judge Judith O. Stein.
The two could face the death penalty if convicted.
   The pair chatted quietly before the proceedings began,
occasionally smiling and turning to nod at relatives sitting in the
packed courtroom.
   The two stood as Ms. Stein read the charges against them: two
counts each of murder, with allegations of committing the killings
for financial gain, lying in wait with a shotgun and committing
multiple murders.
   The sons are accused of killing their father, Hollywood film
executive Jose Menendez, 45, and their mother, former beauty queen
Kitty Menendez, 44, so they could inherit the couple's fortune.
   Ms. Stein set an April 9 date for them to return to Municipal
Court for pretrial motions and the setting of a preliminary hearing
date.
   At that time, the judge will consider a prosecution motion to
unseal paperwork containing the evidence prosecutors say justified
a search of the office of family psychologist Jerome Oziel.
   At issue is whether tape-recorded conversations between the
brothers and Oziel may be used as evidence in the case.
   Such therapy sessions, like conferences with doctors and
lawyers, are generally not admissible in court, but exceptions can
be made in cases where threats are made.
   Deputy District Attorney Eliott Alhadeff said the privilege had
been violated because threats were made during the conversations
with Oziel. He also suggested some conversations took place outside
a therapist-patient relationship.
   But Lyle Menendez's attorney, Gerald Chaleff, said he believes
none of the tapes are admissible.
   Without the tapes, Chaleff said he believes the case is ``highly
circumstantial and one that can be proved only if they are assumed
to be guilty.''
   Prosecutors say the sons fired repeated shotgun blasts at their
parents as the couple watched television last August in an upstairs
den in the family's Beverly Hills mansion.
   The killings were so bloody, and clues so few, that many in
Hollywood believed the hard-driving Menendez had been killed by
mobsters. They thought he might have run afoul of organized crime
in his role as head of Live Entertainment, a video company
affiliated with Carolco Pictures, the producer of the ``Rambo''
movies and other action films.
   After more than six months of investigation, police arrested the
sons. The motive was greed, they said.

   A man whose rape and mutilation of a
7-year-old boy sparked a rewriting of sexual predator laws was
ordered imprisoned for 131{ years by a judge who called him ``a
danger to the defenseless.''
   Pierce County Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Sauriol sentenced
Earl Kenneth Shriner on Monday to three times the maximum standard
term under state law. Even with time off for good behavior, Sauriol
noted, Shriner still would have to serve more than 88 years.
   Shriner, diagnosed as slightly retarded, had a 25-year history
of violence against young people. His case galvanized public
efforts to get repeat sexual offenders off the street. The state
Legislature enacted a strong sexual predator law.
   Sauriol told Shriner the crime had angered and troubled him more
than any in his 37-year legal career.
   ``I don't think that I have ever heard of a case that borders on
extreme cruelty more than this one,'' Sauriol said. ``The reality
is, Mr. Shriner, you present a danger to the defenseless.''
   Shriner, who did not testify in his own defense, said nothing.
   The 40-year-old Shriner was convicted Feb. 7 of first-degree
attempted murder, two counts of first-degree rape and first-degree
assault in the May 20, 1989, attack on a 7-year-old boy in a wooded
area near their homes in south Tacoma. The boy was raped, choked
and had his penis cut off.
   Neighbors said they found the boy naked, bloody, covered with
mud and practically incoherent. A jail inmate testified during the
trial that Shriner admitted mutilating the boy, who has since
undergone reconstructive surgery.
   The boy, who identified Shriner in court as his attacker, was
not present. The victim's mother, Helen Harlow, dabbing her eyes
and comforted by friends, said she was satisfied with the sentence.
   Deputy Prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet said, ``I think that it
served the purpose.''
   Defense attorney Dino Sepe said he would appeal the verdict and
the sentence.
   If the convictions stand, defense attorneys said Shriner's
sentence should have been within the standard range of 34 years to
43 years, 10 months.
   Harlow's voice broke as she described to the court how the
attack had shattered her and her son's lives.
   ``It all comes down to forgiveness,'' she told the judge. ``If
we are to forgive him, it will be in the context of knowing that we
are safe from him.''
   In sentencing Shriner, Sauriol criticized legislation that would
have permitted a 75 percent reduction in prison terms for sex
offenders who voluntarily submit to surgical castration.
   The measure died in the state House of Representatives after
clearing the Senate this year. Corey-Boulet had argued for a longer
prison term partly because a similar bill might one day become law.
   Shriner was declared a ``defective delinquent'' in 1965 after
choking a 7-year-old girl. The term, now abandoned, referred to
violence-prone juveniles with emotional or mental problems.
   He subsequently was confined at Rainier School for the retarded;
Western State Hospital, a mental institution; and the Washington
Corrections Center, where he served 10 years for assaulting two
16-year-old hitchhikers.

<HEAD>Japanese Lawmakers Balk at U.S. Trade Demands</HEAD>

   Japanese lawmakers meeting with Washington
officials today balked at American demands they enact broad
economic reforms to help shrink the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
   In trade talks last week, U.S. officials urged Japan to revise
land-use policies, streamline its retail distribution system and
increase government spending in order to boost consumption of
imports.
   Lawmakers attending the breakfast meeting said U.S. Embassy
officials were told the reforms would be difficult to achieve
quickly.
   At Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's request, the Japanese
government has drawn up proposals aimed at meeting the U.S.
requests made during the ongoing trade talks. In remarks to
Parliament, Japanese officials have said the reforms should be
undertaken for the sake of Japanese consumers.
   But some leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party are
less conciliatory toward the United States, said party lawmaker
Takujiro Hamada, who chaired today's meeting.
   ``The parliamentarians said resistance to the reforms was very
strong in their constituencies,'' Hamada said.
   Another Liberal Democratic lawmaker, Ichiji Ishii said: ``The
opinions expressed by the Japanese legislators were rather severe.''
   ``They said the `menu' of U.S. demands was much too big,'' he
said.
   Japanese newspapers have said U.S. officials gave Japan a list
of more than 200 suggestions aimed at eliminating structural
barriers Washington says prevent foreign companies from entering
Japanese markets.
   Japan says problems on the U.S. side also contribute to the
trade imbalance.
   In the latest round of trade talks last week, Japan suggested
the United States raise taxes, wean itself from energy-wasting cars
and limit the use of credit cards, the mass circulation newspaper
Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
   The suggestions were among 80 Japanese proposals for cutting the
U.S. federal budget deficit, increasing savings and investment and
improving worker training and education, the paper said. The
measures were designed to boost the competitiveness of American
exports, it said.
   Acccording to Hamada, the powerful former foreign minister,
Shintaro Abe, said charges Japan had done nothing to resolve the
trade imbalance were ``absolutely wrong.''
   ``It seems almost as if Japan is being scolded for having such a
powerful, competitive economy,'' Hamada said.
   Japan and the United States are both to come up with interim
reports on the trade talks in early April. A final report is
expected in July.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd item on Trump to UPDATE throughout with accusations
of adultery, details</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For better or worse or until billions do them
part, says the lawyer for Ivana Trump, who thinks his client should
get half of her estranged husband's fortune _ which he estimated at
$5 billion.
   Mrs. Trump's lawyers said in papers filed Monday that she does
not intend to file for divorce, despite allegations that Trump in
1987 ``was engaging in adulterous relationships ... including the
notorious relationship with Marla Maples.''
   ``She wants to preserve the family unit,'' her attorney, Michael
Kennedy, said at an afternoon news conference.
   Lawyers for Trump refused to comment on the allegation of
adultery and said the papers were ``legally and factually
deficient.''
   They have 20 days to file a response.
   The papers filed Monday state that Mrs. Trump never waived the
right to an ``equitable share'' of the properties Trump accumulated
during their 13-year marriage.
   Kennedy said Mrs. Trumpe was not advised by her former attorney,
Lawrence H. Levner, of her right to up to half the property
acquired by either partner during the marriage, as provided by the
1980 state Domestic Relations Law.
   Trump attorneys Jay Goldberg and Stan Lotwin called the action a
``low blow.''
   They denied Kennedy's assertion that Trump had forced his wife
to accept Levner as her lawyer.
   Levner declined to comment.
   Goldberg said Mrs. Trump's claim to be a ``worldly, wise and
knowledgeable woman'' who made significant contributions to the
Trump empire was inconsistent with her assertion that she was
unaware of her rights when she signed a 1987 post-marital agreement.
   Kennedy denied reports that the contract called for Mrs. Trump
to receive $25 million in the event the marriage broke up.
   Golderg called the move by Mrs. Trump a ``pressure tactic
designed to force a settlement.''
   ``He will not surrender,'' Goldberg said of Trump. ``Through his
own brains he made it. She took care of the kids and did the
laundry.''
   Asked if Trump intended to file for divorce, Lotwin said, ``He
has really left his options open.''
   The Trumps' marital problems came to light last month when the
developer left his wife, setting off a geyser of headlines and
speculation about Trump's relationships with other women.

   After watching the Motion Picture Academy
dole out awards over 3{ hours, Hollywood's stars fanned out from
the downtown Music Center to glittery parties thronged by hoards of
fans.
   ``Was it a good show? You can never tell when you're there,''
said Anjelica Huston, at a bash at the Mondrian Hotel Monday night.
   Miss Huston wandered around the palm tree-lined patio with the
likes of Rob Lowe, Dudley Moore, Billy Crystal, Christina Applegate
and former California Gov. Jerry Brown.
   Oliver Stone, winner of the best director Oscar for ``Born on
the Fourth of July,'' was mobbed in the lobby by autograph-seeking
fans. He posed briefly for pictures with Crystal and was hustled
into an elevator.
   A few blocks up Sunset Boulevard, hundreds of squealing fans
cheered a procession of limousines dropping off passengers at the
prestigious Spago party put on by literary agent Irving ``Swifty''
Lazar. Inside, guests dined on Wolfgang Puck's famous pizza and
pasta.
   Back downtown, the prestigious Board of Governors Ball took on
the festive atmosphere of what it must have been like when the
Academy Awards were celebrated in ballrooms at local hotels.
   The Music Center patrons had only to move a few yards into a
huge white tent with oversized balloons at the top.
   Winners and losers congregated around the dance floor and
congratulated and commiserated with each other in a communal spirit
rarely seen in today's Hollywood.
   Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson, who handed out the best
picture award to ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' checked out the scene and
chatted with friends like Jessica Lange and Daryl Hannah.
   Best actress winner Jessica Tandy and her husband of 47 years,
Hume Cronyn, accepted congratulations at their table while Martin
Scorsese, Spike Lee and Danny Aiello represented the New York crowd
in their own corner.
   ``Mighty good show,'' commented Oscar winner Gregory Peck, who
presented the award to Miss Tandy for her starring role in
``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   The air at the Governors Ball was largely one of
self-congratulation, with the 3{-hour show drawing plaudits from
those who attended. Academy President Karl Malden quieted the crowd
to introduce Gilbert Cates, who produced the 62nd Oscar
presentation.
   Cates acknowledged that he was trying something unique in the
satellite feeds from four foreign capitals but general opinion was
that the gimmick worked.
   Earlier in the day, former President Ronald Reagan and his wife
Nancy kicked off the third annual Oscar night gala to benefit
Athletes and Entertainers for Kids at a Beverly Hills hotel.
   Reagan told 40 disadvantaged and sick youngsters from various
hospitals and inner city community centers that people indeed care
about them.
   ``We're so proud of each and every one of you for your strength
and courage,'' Reagan said before handing out yo-yos.
   Mrs. Reagan, in an emotional voice, said, ``I know it's tough
but you'll make it. I just want to say I'm proud of you and I love
you.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today
appealed to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to halt Red Army
pressure on Lithuania and open a dialogue with the
independence-minded republic.
   Walesa said Gorbachev's reform policies, including his decision
to end the Communist Party's monopoly on power, were ``unquestioned
achievements,'' possible only because of the Soviet leader's ``bold
politics.''
   But in a letter addressed to the Soviet president and released
by Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk, Walesa expressed grave
concern over Soviet moves in neighboring Lithuania.
   ``I am filled with greatest anxiety by the Soviet actions in
Lithuania,'' Walesa said of today's arrests of Lithuanian deserters
from the Soviet army and occupation of Communist Party buildings in
the republic.
   In the letter, the Solidarity leader said the actions were ``in
striking contradiction with the spirit of the policy you have been
carrying out for years.''
   Walesa, who led the political forces that ended Communist rule
in Poland, warned that recent history in Eastern Europe has shown
military force to not be an effective means of resolving political
problems.
   ``Violating the sovereignty of Lithuania is an action directed
against the process of constructing a new democratic order in
Europe,'' Walesa said. ``I turn to you, Mr. President, to abandon
the practice of military pressure and undertake political dialogue
with the Lithuanian government.''
   The Polish government supports Lithuania's drive for
self-determination.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania and the two other
Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia in 1940. The republic
declared its independence from Moscow on March 11.
   A hihg-powered Polish parliamentary delegation arrived in
Lithuania on Friday for talks with Lithuanian President Vytautas
Lansbergis, caucus spokesman Jacek Zakowski said.

<HEAD>Government to Start Processing U.S. Toy Company's Entry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case seen as a test of alleged unfair barriers
to entering the Japanese market, the government has agreed to
consider a U.S. toy company's move to open a store in the country,
officials said today.
   Toys ``R'' Us has announced plans to open a 53,800-square-foot
discount store in Niigata, 160 miles northwest of Tokyo.
   Local shopkeepers were strongly opposing the move, news reports
said. Under Japan's Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, designed to
protect small retailers, they must be consulted before the opening
of any large stores in their areas.
   While some Japanese retailers have had to wait up to 10 years
for permission to set up large new stores, ``consideration is under
way to shorten the maximum waiting period required under the law to
two years,'' said an official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry.
   The Minister for international trade, Kabun Muto, told a news
conference today that he urged his aides to work out plans to
shorten the consultation process required under the law.
   The ministry and local agencies in Niigata prefecture agreed
Monday to start procedures for the store-opening plan by Paramus,
N.J.-based Toys ``R'' Us, said the ministry official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The official, of the ministry's Industrial Policy Bureau, said
local retailers will receive an advance explanation of the plan by
mid-April.
   The U.S. company then is to submit formal notification of the
plan to the trade minister, and deliberations by a group of local
retailers, consumers and scholars will follow, he said.
   The Large-Scale Retail Stores Law has been among targets of U.S.
officials seeking changes in what are seen as structural barriers
that contribute to the United States' $49 billion deficit in trade
with Japan.
   In addition to making entry to Japan's market difficult for
foreign retailers, it works against larger Japanese stores that
would be more likely to carry foreign products, U.S. officials say.
   Japan says U.S. economic practices such as widespread credit
purchases also contribute to the trade imbalance.
   The two sides have been negotiating steps to change such
practices, and each side is to produce an interim report on reform
plans in April.

   ``'Twas a fine night for the Irish,'' said
Gregory Peck at the Governors Ball following the 62nd Academy
Awards.
   And for the English, the Italians, the Japanese and Americans.
The first International Academy Awards were truly that, both in
award giving and in the program's origins.
   The Academy voters gave their prized trophy without concern for
chauvinism and with a pervading prejudice for humanism.
   The Irish were triumphant with ``My Left Foot,'' winning Oscars
for Daniel Day-Lewis as best actor and Brenda Fricker as supporting
actress.
   Although Day-Lewis is English, Miss Fricker is Irish through and
through. So, too, is ``My Left Foot,'' filmed in Dublin on a $2.5
million shoestring budget.
   It's the saga of a curious Irish hero, Christy Brown, the
cerebral palsy victim who vanquished superhuman odds to become an
acclaimed artist and writer, using only his foot to communicate.
   ``Cinema Paradiso'' was a popular winner for best foreign
language film. The Italian movie, like Monday night's Oscar cast,
celebrates the love of film. It tells the story of a village boy
who spends much of his youth in the projection room of the local
movie house.
   Jessica Tandy, London-born and now a U.S. citizen, added to the
internationalism with her best actress win for ``Driving Miss
Daisy.''
   Americans also figured in the honors, notably Denzel Washington
as supporting actor in ``Glory'' and Oliver Stone for directing
``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   The Academy voters were not impressed by the megabuck achievers,
awarding one lesser Oscar apiece to ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' and ``Batman.''
   Their principal concern seemed to be the human condition,
whether it entailed race relations (``Driving Miss Daisy'' and
``Glory'') or the plight of the handicapped (``My Left Foot'' and
``Born on the Fourth of July.'')
   In one of the evening's most heartwarming and significant
events, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas presented a special award
to Akira Kurosawa, considered by many critics as the greatest
living filmmaker.
   Kurosawa was greeted by fellow workers in Japan who led a
``Happy Birthday'' serenade. The director of ``The Seven Samurai''
and ``Ran'' reached 80 last weekend.
   Satellite feeds from London, Moscow, Sydney and Buenos Aires
gave diversity to the telecast, even though Jack Lemmon was
subjected to a triple echo in Moscow.
   Despite its bloated length at more than 3{ hours, the Music
Center ceremony generally got good reviews from those attending.
Billy Crystal was a popular emcee, his flashes of humor almost
always on target.
   Oscar organizers say there seems to be no way to reduce the
excessive length unless a half-dozen or more awards are eliminated
or given off-camera. A move to do either would meet with screams
from the Academy's various category divisions.
   The Academy has long preached that all the nominees are winners,
and that theme was carried out for a second consecutive year.
Instead of the timeworn phrase, ``And the winner is...,'' the
presenters were instructed to say, ``And the Oscar goes to... .''
   That may be of some consolation to the losers. Then again,
probably not.

   Japan and the United States exchanged diplomatic
notes today allowing Japan to manufacture an improved version of
the U.S.-made Sparrow missile system under license, Defense Agency
officials said.
   Japan's Air Self Defense Force will use the improved AIM-7M
missile system to arm its F-15 jet fighter planes and other types
of aircraft, a Defense Agency official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The new, more reliable missile will replace the AIM-7F missile
system currently used here, he said. The official refused to
provide other details, including the number of missiles to be
manufactured in Japan.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama and U.S. Ambassador Michael
Armacost exchanged the notes on acquisition and production of the
AIM-7M Sparrow missile system, developed by Raytheon Co. of
Lexington, Mass.
   The system will be produced in Japan by a group of companies,
with Mitsubishi Electric Corp. as the main contractor, the official
said.
   Japan's Air Self-Defense Force maintains 112 U.S.-designed F-15
fighters, most of them built in Japan under license. Some
``blackbox'' components that use secret technology, including
computers and advanced avionic systems, are sent from the United
States for installation in the planes, said another Defense Agency
official, also speaking on condition of anonymity.

   A Soviet Aeroflot airlines transport plane of the
Il-76 type crashed today near Afghanistan's capital of Kabul, the
official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   ``The fate of the crew and the causes of the accident are being
investigated,'' Tass said in a brief announcement.
   The Il-76, a freight transport, accommodates a crew of seven,
including two freight handlers.
   Tass said the plane was carrying civilian goods and crashed as
it was flying toward Kabul airport at noon local time.
   The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1980 and says it lost
about 14,000 soldiers in the nine-year war there before pulling out
in 1989. It still provides supplies to the Kabul government, which
is fighting U.S.-backed Moslem rebels.

   European leaders today urged the Soviet Union to
end its military show of force in Lithuania and to hold talks with
leaders of the Baltic republic.
   At NATO headquarters and in capitals across the continent,
leaders warned that today's storming of hospitals sheltering Soviet
Army deserters, as well as the weekend display of military might,
could slow democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and damage
East-West relations.
   Poland's Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sent a letter to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressing the ``greatest anxiety''
about events in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius.
   ``Violating the sovereignty of Lithuania is an action directed
against the process of constructing a new democratic order in
Europe,'' Walesa said.
   ``I turn to you, Mr. President, to abandon the practice of
military pressure and undertake political dialogue with the
Lithuanian government,'' he said.
   Norway's Prime Minister Jan P. Syse called Moscow's parading of
tanks and order to confiscate firearms ``a shockingly unwise step.
They have made an already tense situation dangerously acute.''
   ``Monday's cautious hope for negotiations and dialogue today
emerge as a tactical game, a completely destructive course, from
which we sharply dissociate,'' Syse said in a statement.
   ``It is now crucial that Soviet leaders express willingness to
negotiate before the situation gets entirely out of control.
Continued use of power will not solve any problems, but can
seriously jeopardize the results recently achieved in East-West
relations.''
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, senior officials monitoring
events in Lithuania fear ``adverse developments'' there could hurt
the improved East-West climate, an alliance official said.
   ``If the situation is not solved peacefully through
negotiations, it could derail a lot of other things,'' said the
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said senior political officers of the 16 nations of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization met in a special session on Monday and
continued their talks today.
   After Monday's closed-door discussions, the official said:
``There was a sense of the people at the meeting that talks between
Gorbachev and the Lithuanians should take place in an atmosphere
free of intimidation or pressure of any kind.''
   He said it was also the feeling of those at the meeting that
``any adverse developments in Lithuania would have consequences for
positive, international political trends.''
   He declined to elaborate on the possible consequences.
   The Dutch government issued a statement expressing its ``worry
about the increasing pressure ... that is being exacted on the
Lithuanian population through a military show of force.''
   The Dutch urged Moscow to use ``maximum restraint'' to
``peacefully solve the conflict with Lithuania along political
lines.''
   The British Foreign Office had no comment today, referring
reporters to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's statement in the
House of Commons last week.
   She said then that Britain supports Lithuania's desire to
determine its own future, and that it never recognized Moscow's
annexation of the Baltic republics.

<TEXT>
   Rival center-right and liberal parties
plotted strategies today to try to win enough support in runoff
elections to form Hungary's first post-war non-Communist government.
   Final results of the country's first free elections in 43 years
remained unavailable this afternoon, two days after the last of
millions of voters cast ballots for the 394-seat Parliament.
   A final tally from the 11,000 polls was not expected before late
today, and Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral
Committee, blamed the Interior Ministry because its electoral
office was supplying incomplete information on the voting to the
committee.
   Nemeth did not specify whether he thought the Interior Ministry,
which many Hungarians continue to associate with Communist
repression because of its control of internal security, was
willfully delaying results showing a poor performance by the
old-guard Communist Party.
   An Interior Ministry official, who declined to give his name on
the telephone, denied the the delay was deliberate. He said it was
due to the slow transmission of data to the ministry from outlying
polling stations.
   More than 70 percent of Hungary's 7.8 million eligible voters
cast ballots, election officials said. By late Monday, only five of
the seats were decided.
   With more than 80 percent of the ballots cast for 29 parties
running counted, the conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum led
with 24.7 percent of the vote, the center-left League of Free
Democrats had 21.6 percent, and the rural-based Independent
Smallholders was in third with 11.9 percent.
   The Democratic Forum wants to move more slowly than the Free
Democrats toward market-oriented reform, in grappling with an
economy beset by double-digit inflation and a $20 billion foreign
debt after four decades of Communist rule.
   Neither of the two leading parties garnered anything close to
the absolute majority needed for decisive victory, making a
coalition government likely after runoff elections are held next
month, possibly on April 8.
   Democratic Forum chairman Joszef Antall said the Independent
Smallholders would be his first choice as coalition partners, and
like the Free Democrats, he dismissed any idea of working with the
Socialists.
   Far back in fourth place with 10.7 percent were the ruling
Socialists, the successors of the old Communist party who
campaigned on a democratic platform but apparently were still
associated by voters with the Communist past.
   The apparent aversion to anything that smacked of socialism
accounted for the poor showing by the Social Democrats, who hadn't
managed to clear the 4 percent hurdle needed to gain representation
in Parliament.
   Voters in East Germany on March 18 had a similar reaction to
four decades of Communist rule, choosing a conservative coalition.
   The old-style Communists who refused to join the reform wing in
founding the Socialist Party last October also fared badly. Their
leader, Gyula Thuermer, finished a distant fifth in a western
district and the party also failed to clear the 4 percent hurdle,
preliminary results showed.
   Among the five seats decided outright were three taken by
Democratic Forum members and one by Premier Miklos Nemeth, a reform
Communist, the Socialist Party co-founder and chief supporter of
democracy. Nemeth ran as an independent in his home riding of
Szerencs, 70 miles northeast of Budapest.
   Nemeth said his outgoing government should receive credit for
leading the nation to Sunday's historic vote.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds Death Sentence For Bomber of KAL Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld the
death sentence of a Communist agent convicted of bombing a South
Korean jetliner in 1987, killing all 115 people aboard, court
officials said.
   The officials said today's ruling marked the end of the appeals
process for confessed North Korean agent Kim Hyon Hee, 27, but
there were reports she might be pardoned.
   About a dozen family members of victims interrupted the
proceedings shouting, ``No special pardon for Kim! Hang her!''
   Court officials said Kim was not in the courtroom.
   She was sentenced to death after a trial that began in February
1989, more than a year after Korean Air (KAL) Flight 858 vanished
over the Andaman Sea near Burma on Nov. 29, 1987.
   Local newspapers, quoting unnamed government officials, said
prosecutors will recommend that President Roh Tae-woo give Kim a
special pardon in consideration of her full repentance and
cooperation. Pardons have been granted to some North Korean agents
who have shown repentance in the past.
   Kim said at her trial that under instructions from Communist
North Korea, she planted two bombs in the overhead luggage bin of
the Boeing 707 that departed from Baghdad, Iraq, for Seoul. North
Korea has denied any involvement.
   She said she and a male accomplice got off the plane during a

<HEAD>Military Ruler Denies Allegations Of Pol Pot-Style Resettlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military ruler Gen. Saw Maung today
rejected criticism of his government's mass resettlement program
and charges of official corruption in narcotics trafficking.
   In a speech during the annual armed forces day in Rangoon, the
general who seized power in 1988 said foreign news organizations
are interfering with Burma's internal affairs by broadcasting such
critical reports.
   ``I hereby categorically deny all these groundless accusations
as totally false,'' Saw Maung said.
   Foreign media have quoted Western diplomats in Rangoon as saying
the government has moved up to a half million people from urban
areas to outlying areas in order to break up regions of political
dissent.
   In a statement received in Bangkok today, Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., compared the resettlement policy to that of
ousted Cambodian leader Pol Pot.
   During Pol Pot's Communist Khmer Rouge government from
1975-1978, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians died from
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   The U.S. State Department last week also criticized Burma's
relocations.
   Saw Maung claimed the program was aimed at giving land to
homeless people who had been living on religious land, cemeteries
and rubbish dumps.
   Diplomats said it was designed to prevent a repeat of the
massive anti-government protests of 1988, which the military
brutally crushed when it seized power in September that year.
   Saw Maung dismissed as ``groundless'' what he said was a March
10 Voice of America report saying the flow of narcotics from Burma
was out of control because of corruption among Burmese, Thai and
Laotian officials.
   On Monday in Bangkok, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Melvin
Levitsky accused the Burmese government of colluding with narcotics
traffickers and doing little to stem a record outflow of heroin.
   In his address, Saw Maung also attacked foreign media reports on
the arrest and suppression of opposition groups.
   Moynihan's statement denounced Thailand for ``profiting from the
desperation of the Burmese regime.''
   Thailand has been one of the few countries to embrace Saw
Maung's government. It has since secured valuable logging, mining
and fishing concessions.

<HEAD>Norway's Seal Hunt Begins, Hunters Find Peace in Arctic Storms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUG MELLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norway's seal hunt began this week, allowing
hunters to escape to the relative peace of howling wind and bitter
cold of an Arctic island. The real storm is on the mainland.
   Environmental and animal welfare groups demand an end to the
heavily subsidized hunt for thousands of adult seals.
   Photographs of seal pups being beaten to death, so their white
pelts would not be marred by gunshot wounds, sparked furious
international protest and forced Norway to ban the hunt for pups
beginning last year.
   Seal men complain of hate mail and death threats. Opponents
collected 80,000 signatures on a petition in Sweden this month, and
demonstrators poured blood-red paint outside the Norway's Embassy
in Stockholm.
   Protesters say the hunt threatens seal stocks, a claim disputed
by the government. The hunters' claim, that unchecked seal
populations deplete coastal fish stocks, also is debated.
   ``Norway as a fishing nation must have the right to determine
how its own ocean resources will be used. We cannot allow
environmental groups to dictate our policy,'' said Karsten
Klepsvik, of Norway's fishing ministry.
   Hunters and those processing the catch will get $1.4 million in
state subsidies this year, to maintain employment and keep the hunt
going, Klepsvik said.
   Two of Norway's active seal-hunting fleet of four vessels set
sail on Monday for the Greenland Sea around Jan Mayen island, just
inside the Arctic Circle.
   Animal welfare groups find abhorrent the traditional killing
method of clubbing or hitting the animals in the head with a sharp
pick.
   ``There is no rational reason for continuing the hunt. The whole
hunt is an exercise in national chauvinism, maintaining tradition
for tradition's sake,'' said Paul Bugge, of Greenpeace Norway.
   Sigbjoern Espensen, 17, was uncomprehending of the hubbub as he
joined his second hunt. ``I guess I'm just bitten by the bug,'' he
told the Dagbladet newspaper before sailing north.
   Veteran arctic skipper Paul Stark said he also has trouble
understanding the uproar, figuring that seal-hunting will die out
anyway. ``The ships are old and no one is building new ones,'' he
said.
   The hunters have a quota of 34,400 adult seals, cut by 4,100
from last year. Prior to 1975, Norwegians killed 100,000 seals a
year, Klepsvik said.
   ``We hope someday this wave of hate will ease and we will be
able to sell the products again,'' he said.
   Christian Rieber, Norway's last big seal pelt buyer, said he
received 5,000 pieces of hate mail on Monday alone. The total is
about 100,000 post cards so far this year, in a campaign he said
was coordinated in the United States.
   One card called Rieber ``the merchant of death.'' Another, from
Orlando, Fla., ordered him to ``leave my seals alone.'' A third,
from Sweden, threatened him with ``a slow and painful death.''
   ``I'm used to it. It follows a pattern,'' said Rieber, 65. He
claimed that campaigns start up whenever activists need money.
   Environmentalists say Rieber bears primary blame. ``The blame
lies where the money is. Without him, the whole seal hunt would
stop,'' Bugge said.
   ``We don't make any money on seals. The government pays for
it,'' said Rieber, whose family has worked in the seal trade for
100 years. He said bans on importing pelts to many countries left
his company with 100,000 unsold skins in storage.

   China's Communist Party expelled 33,400 members
last year for ``unhealthy tendencies'' such as abuse of power or
ideological shortcomings, the official party daily said today.
   Party inspection offices investigated 197,400 cases of
discipline violations within the party, and measures were taken
against 158,800 members, the People's Daily said.
   The 48-million-member ruling party urged a reappraisal of the
credentials of all its members following last spring's
pro-democracy movement that gained considerable support from party
members.
   After the movement was crushed in June, party leaders said those
who had failed to pass the ideological tests of the
``counter-revolutionary rebellion'' would face expulsion or other
disciplinary action.
   However, the People's Daily report did not give a breakdown of
reasons for the expulsions, and the number was not noticeably
higher than in past years.
   In 1987 the party expelled 25,000 members, bringing the total
number of expulsions between 1982 and 1987 to 177,000. No figures
were available for 1988.
   In the past, most of those dropped from party ranks were charged
with economic crimes such as bribery or accused of using their
party office to obtain lavish banquets, good housing or
preferential treatment for family members.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Federal Black Lung Benefits Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today upheld a federal law
that one state court said makes it too difficult for coal miners
who contract ``black lung'' to get a lawyer's help when seeking
benefits.
   The justices unanimously reversed a ruling by West Virginia's
highest court that the law, and its system for awarding lawyer fees
in black lung benefits cases, violates due-process rights.
   ``The evidence relied upon by the West Virginia Supreme Court
did not remotely establish either that black lung claimants are
unable to retain qualified counsel or that the cause of such
inability is the attorney's fees system'' used by the Labor
Department, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court.
   Pneumoconiosis, a chronic respiratory and pulmonary disease
commonly called black lung, afflicts numerous coal miners.
   Under the Black Lung Benefits Act, Congress provides disability
payments to those miners who are unable to work because of the
disease.
   Those who apply for such benefits are entitled to have a
lawyer's help, and lawyers who assist miners in obtaining benefits
have their fees paid by the coal mine operator, its insurance
carrier or the government.
   To get such fees paid, a lawyer must apply separately to the
Labor Department and to the official that presided over the
application hearing. No fees award is made until a miner receives a
final award of benefits.
   West Virginia lawyer George R. Triplett, beginning in 1978,
entered into contingent-fee agreements to help about 15 miners
seeking black lung benefits. The agreements entitled Triplett to
one-fourth of any back benefits collected by the miners.
   Since the fees Triplett collected between 1978 and 1983 were
never approved by the Labor Department or any court, they were in
violation of Labor Department regulations.
   The West Virginia State Bar's Committee on Legal Ethics in 1987
recommended that the state's highest court suspend Triplett for six
months for violating the regulations.
   The state Supreme Court of Appeals, in a 3-2 decision in 1988,
refused to enforce the suspension.
   The state court said the evidence made clear that most lawyers
are unwilling to represent miners seeking black lung benefits
because of ``inadequate fees'' and the long delays in collecting
them.
   Once a miner is awarded benefits, the state court said, it often
takes ``an additional two years ... for a lawyer to be paid his
fee.'' There is no provision for interest payments.
   The state court ruling did not bar the Labor Department's own
enforcement of its attorney-fee regulations, but it knocked out the
primary method of enforcing those regulations in West Virginia _
state bar disciplinary hearings.
   Today's decision said the state court did not have enough solid
evidence to make its ruling.
   ``As to the ... unavailability of attorneys, the court relied
upon three lawyers' assessments,'' Scalia wrote. ``This will not
do.''
   He said past high court rulings ``made clear that this sort of
anecdotal evidence will not overcome the presumption of regularity
and constitutionality to which a program established by Congress is
entitled.''
   Scalia also said there was insufficient proof that the asserted
unavailability of lawyers to handle black lung benefits cases could
be tied to a fees system.
   The case is Labor Department vs. Triplett, 88-1671.

<HEAD>Problems Could Delay U.N.-Coordinated Relief Program in Sudan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disagreements over the amounts of food
going to government and rebel-held territories could delay a
U.N.-coordinated relief operation to help millions threatened by
famine.
   United Nations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in a
message to a meeting of Sudanese government officials and Western
donors Monday, urged fast action to head off a disaster in southern
Sudan.
   Christian and animist rebels in the south have waged a
7-year-old war for autonomy from the Moslem-dominated government in
Khartoum. The war created a famine estimated to have killed 300,000
southerners in 1988.
   ``Unless immediate and effective action is taken to expedite the
delivery and distribution of food and other humanitarian supplies
to the affected civilian populations, we may once more be faced
with a disaster of major proportions,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   The message was read at the meeting by Michael Priestly, the
secretary-general's special representative for emergency and relief
operations in Sudan.
   ``There are still substantial differences on the details of
relief and rehabilitation allocations, and more recently, funding
arrangements, which could further delay phase two of Operation
Lifeline Sudan unless a more pragmatic approach be adopted by all
concerned,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   The U.N. work plan says that 4.5 million southerners need
emergency relief assistance this summer. About 2.3 million live in
the war-torn areas in southern Sudan, 400,000 others fled to border
areas and about 1.8 million displaced people have gone to Khartoum.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan, a massive international relief effort
coordinated by the United Nations in 1989, is credited with saving
hundreds of thousands of lives. The operation was made possible be
a de facto cease-fire between the government and the rebel Sudan
People's Liberation Army.
   The relief operation was halted when fighting resumed between
the two sides late last year. About 87,000 tons of food and other
supplies had been sent to famine areas, some 18,000 tons short of
the targeted amount.
   The United Nations had hoped to start ferrying 104,000 tons of
fresh relief supplies to the south by the beginning of next month.
But last week the rebels claimed the relief program was biased in
favor of the government. They hinted they might block it unless the
United Nations decides to send more food to rebel-held areas.

<HEAD>U.S. Proposes Declaration of Commitment To Free-Market Principles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States wants the Soviet
Union and all other participants of a 35-nation economic conference
to sign a declaration committing themselves to Western-style
free-market principles, U.S. officials said today.
   A Soviet official at the meeting welcomed the idea of
establishing guidelines for expansion of East-West economic
cooperation but expressed reservations about the U.S. proposal.
   Alan F. Holmer, a former U.S. deputy trade representative who
heads the U.S. delegation, said the United States wants to help lay
the groundwork for increased East-West economic activity.
   ``Once you get the economic principles established (in the East
bloc), the commercial relationships will flow relatively
automatically. But without the right principles, you won't have the
commercial relationships,'' Holmer said.
   John Evans, the No. 2 U.S. delegate at the conference in the
West German capital, rejected any suggestion Washington was trying
to set conditions for stepped-up U.S. economic involvement with the
East bloc.
   But like Holmer, he made it clear free-market principles would
foster greater economic links between the wealthy West and
reforming East bloc countries.
   ``We should face up to the fact that market economies are what
work,'' Evans said.
   The United States is asking the 35-nation Conference on Economic
Cooperation in Europe to adopt what the U.S. delegates have called
the ``Bonn Principles for Economic Cooperation.''
   Among other things, the document says the 35 nations recognize
the importance of ``international policies which support the
expansion of free, open trade, investment and capital flows'' and
``full recognition and protection of rights of citizens to hold and
use private property.''
   A high-ranking Soviet official at the conference, Sergei Zotov,
said he supports the U.S. idea of setting out principles for
East-West economic cooperation.
   He also said the U.S. initiative could become a ``positive
contribution'' toward broadening East-West economic links.
   But he said the U.S. document ``presents more a code of
behavior'' for East bloc countries rather than concerning itself
with ``purely principles of economic cooperation.''
   Zotov is deputy head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Department
of Security and Cooperation in Europe.
   Zotov also said he doubts whether there is enough time for the
35-nation conference to thoroughly discuss the U.S. proposal and
act on it.
   The meeting of government officials and business executives
began on March 20 and runs through April 11. The 35-nation group
includes the United States, Canada and all Eastern and Western
European nations except Albania.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Michigan Law Limiting Campaign Spending by
Corporations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today gave states new power
to limit political campaign spending by corporations, upholding a
Michigan law challenged by that state's Chamber of Commerce.
   Voting 6-3, the justices said such restrictions are justified by
the state's interest in preventing corruption or even its
appearance.
   The court rejected arguments that the Michigan law violates free
speech rights of Chamber of Commerce members.
   Supporters of the state law said it is intended to prevent
corporate giants, such as the major automobile manufacturers, from
funneling millions of dollars through the chamber to favorite
candidates without revealing the spending.
   ``Corporate wealth can unfairly influence elections when it is
deployed in the form of independent expenditures,'' Justice
Thurgood Marshall said for the court.
   ``We therefore hold that the state has articulated a
sufficiently compelling rationale to support its restriction on
independent expenditures by corporations,'' he said.
   Marshall also rejected arguments that the law is
unconstitutional because it exempts labor unions and media
corporations.
   He noted that union members who disagree with a union's
political activities can decline to contribute to them without
giving up their membership.
   Media corporations merit exemption to protect the role of
broadcasters and publishers in reporting and commenting on
newsworthy events, Marshall added.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said, ``The
court today endorses the principle that too much speech is an evil
that the democratic majority can proscribe. The principle is ...
incompatible with the absolutely central truth of the First
Amendment: that government cannot be trusted to assure, through
censorship, the fairness of political debate.''
   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor also
dissented.
   The ruling is a victory for the Federal Election Commission,
which supported an appeal by Michigan officials.
   The Michigan Chamber of Commerce has some 8,000 dues-paying
members, about three-fourths of them corporations.
   The chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the
Grand Rapids Press in support of Richard Bandstra, a Republican
candidate for the state House of Representatives.
   Fearing the ad would be considered illegal under Michigan's
Campaign Finance Act, the business group filed a federal suit
seeking to have the law declared unconstitutional as applied to the
chamber.
   The law generally prohibits corporations from spending in behalf
of political candidates and carries a maximum $10,000 fine.
   The act permits a corporation to make such expenditures if it
sets up a special fund, or political action committee, that is
required to keep records and disclose the name of contributors.
   The chamber has such a fund. But it wanted to pay for the
newspaper ad for Bandstra out of its general treasury, which is
exempt from the record-keeping and reporting requirements of the
campaign finance law.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals exempted the Chamber of
Commerce from the law.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court ruling
limiting the federal government's power to regulate corporate
political spending.
   The justices said then that the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed
primarily to influence public opinion and not to make a profit.
   The high court in 1986 ruled in favor of a Massachusetts
``pro-life'' group formed to protest the legalization of abortion.
   But today the justices drew key distinctions between the
Massachusetts group and the Chamber of Commerce.
   Marshall said the pro-life organization's narrow focus ensured
its resources reflected political support for that issue. The
Chamber's more varied bylaws contain no such assurances, he said.
   Moreover, he said, Chamber members may be reluctant for economic
reasons to withdraw from the organization even if they disagree
with its political views.
   The case is Austin vs. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 88-1569.

   Serbian police today began purging
Kosovo's police force of ethnic Albanians who stand accused of
inaction during ethnic unrest in the troubled province.
   Serbian police, who control the security force of Kosovo
province, intend to purge 70 percent of ethnic Albanians from
police ranks, and 100 already have been fired, according to news
reports in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
   Serbian authorities were also demanding the resignation of Jusuf
Karakushi, Kosovo's ethnic Albanian police chief, the reports said.
   Kosovo is one of two provinces of Serbia, the largest of the
Yugoslav republics. Ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of
Kosovo's 1.9 million population and have pressed for greater
autonomy.
   But a year ago, the federal government approved constitutional
changes that gave Serbia almost complete control over Kosovo,
claiming the Serbian minority was being harassed by ethnic
Albanians.
   Meanwhile, security forces in Kosovo braced for unrest expected
Wednesday, the first anniversary of the amendments. The date was
recently proclaimed a national holiday in Serbia.
   ``The proclamation of March 28 as a Serbian national holiday
represents a provocation whose aim is to further escalate political
conflicts in Kosovo and Yugoslavia,'' read a statement from the
Democratic Union, the largest independent ethnic Albanian party in
Kosovo.
   In Serbia, where the Communist leadership is determined ``to
crush at all cost'' the ethnic Albanian drive for autonomy, the
holiday will be marked with public festivities, news reports said.
   More than 60 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
ethnic violence in Kosovo in the past year.
   Members of an international human rights commission touring
Kosovo said the human rights situation in the province was
``poor.'' They said Yugoslavia, which seeks full membership in the
Council of Europe, may have trouble joining the organization
because of rights violations in the province.
   A Yugoslav parliamentary commission said Monday nearly 2,990
ethnic Albanians were hospitalized in Kosovo since Saturday
complaining of lung and skin problems allegedly caused by a
mysterious poisoning.
   Ethnic Albanians claimed the mysterious illness was caused by
Serbs, while Serbs blamed ethnic Albanians for the poisoning scare,
allegedly intended to trigger massive uprisings in Kosovo.
   No traces of any poisoning were found in any blood or urine
samples and all Albanians had been released from hospital by late
Monday, the commission said.
   Kosovo, which borders Albania, was a part of ancient Serbia.
Most of the Christian Serbs in the province view the Moslem
Albanians as intruders and allege Serbs in Kosovo are harassed by
the Albanians.
   Yugoslavia, which broke from the Soviet bloc in 1948, is
governed by an eight-man presidency, made up of representatives
from the country's six republics and two provinces.

<TEXT>
   An East German church leader today appealed
for an international commission to probe allegations linking new
lawmakers to the ousted Communist regime's secret police.
   The allegations, which involve some leaders of the non-Communist
political parties and the likely new premier, are stalling efforts
to form a government following the country's first free election on
March 18.
   Manfred Stolpe, the chief administrator of East Berlin's
Lutheran Church, recommended that former Swiss president and
justice minister, Kurt Furgler, head the commission.
   In an interview with the West German newspaper Die Welt
newspaper, Stolpe said the international commission should take up
its work after the new East German Parliament is ``officially
constituted, to prevent any further delays in setting up the
country's new government.''
   An alliance of leftist parties urged a full investigation be
conducted before the legislature holds its first sitting.
   The alliance includes New Forum, the pro-democracy group that
led last fall's peaceful revolution but did poorly in the election.
   The Christian Democratic Union, which won the election and has
rejected such a probe before the Parliament's first session, said
it hopes the new lawmaking body will be able to convene next
Tuesday.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democratic chief who is the
party's candidate for premier, has said he hopes to form a new
government before mid-April.
   De Maiziere has been implicated in the secret police allegations
but has strongly denied ever working for the secret police.
   Ibrahim Boehme, whose leftist Social Democratic Party came in a
distant second in the balloting, also denied similar charges
against himself but on Monday temporarily stepped aside as party
leader until the allegations have been cleared up by an independent
commission.
   De Maiziere said Monday he believed he could form his government
``within two weeks.''
   He has offered to form a broad coalition with the Social
Democrats, now led by Boehme's deputy Markus Meckel, to gain a
two-thirds majority needed in the newly elected 400-member
Parliament for a decision on rapid unification with West Germany.
   The 85,000-srong secret police and its 109,000 informers were
used to suppress dissent and keep tight control on East Germans
before ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker resigned last fall
under popular pressure for democratic reforms.
   Officials have said dismantling of the force, known as the
Stasi, has been virtually completed, but many East Germans believe
the secret police are still trying to disrupt the democratic
process.

<HEAD>Senate Refuses to Put Aside Change in Clean Air Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today refused to put aside an
industry-sought change in clean air legislation that would give
companies more flexibility in meeting permit requirements under the
new law.
   Environmentalists have opposed the change, arguing that it
creates loopholes that will allow businesses to avoid compliance
with some pollution controls and inhibit federal enforcement of the
law.
   The Senate voted 50-47 against killing the amendment and
opponents immediately asked that the measure be considered again
later, hoping some senators will change their votes and others who
did not vote would oppose the measure.
   Sen. Don Nickels, R-Okla., had argued that the permit and
enforcement requirements of the bill would spell ``economic
disasters for thousands of businesses'' and result in a
``bureaucratic nightmare'' unless they are streamlined.
   But critics of the amendment said the changes envisioned by
Nickels would allow polluters in some cases to obtain permits that
would allow them to escape some provisions of the new law. It also
would allow some polluters to tie cases up in lengthy litigation
and inhibit citizen lawsuits seeking enforcement of pollution
controls, opponents of the proposed change said.
   The clean air legislation, which imposes a wide range of
emission controls on industry, imposes for the first time a federal
requirement that companies obtain operating permits to ensure
compliance with pollution control requirements.
   About 35 states already have laws requiring such permits. Under
the bill, the EPA would have the authority to review the state and
local permits to ensure that they comply with federal pollution
control requirements.
   The Senate was expected to continue consideration of a wide
range of amendments to the compromise clean air bill on the floor.
Several issues remained unresolved, including whether to provide
financial assistance to coal miners who lose their jobs because of
tighter pollution controls on coal-powered electric utilities.
   The Nickels' amendment was supported by the Bush administration,
although permitting and enforcement provisions of the bill were not
included in the closed-door negotitiations that led to the
compromise clean air bill now before the Senate.
   Senate leaders and sponsors of the compromise bill, therefore,
are free to oppose the proposal.
   Among the industry groups that have lobbied vigorously for
easing the permitting requirements were the National Association of
Manufacturers; the Chemical Manufacturers Association; the Clean
Air Working Group, an industry umbrella group; and the National
Environmental Development Association.

   Officials in Chicago and Elizabeth, N.J., ordered a crackdown on
illegal social clubs to prevent a disastrous fire like the one that
killed 87 people in New York. But few other cities consider such
clubs to be a problem.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' Daniel Weil, Chicago's building commissioner, said Monday.
   At least 100 non-profit social clubs in Chicago that are
registered with the secretary of state will be inspected for
hazardous materials and adequate safety systems, Weil said.
   City officials said they also are trying to locate any
unlicensed centers that would be more likely to have code
violations that could lead to a tragedy like the one early Sunday
in New York.
   In Elizabeth, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business in light of
new attention drawn by the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
   Two owners of one club were arrested Monday and about 100
patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In Paterson, N.J., vice squad Sgt. Michael Recca said three or
four such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   Most cities have stiff laws prohibiting selling liquor without a
license.
   ``If you operate in Texas without a license, you get put in
jail,'' said E.P. McCracken, regional supervisor of the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission in Dallas. ``We don't run our
business in Texas like they do in New York.''
   New York officials say there are literally hundreds of clubs
like Happy Land, a firetrap that attracted a largely poor,
immigrant Hispanic crowd.
   The fire _ allegedly set by the former boyfriend of a club
employee _ prompted a new round of promises by city officials to
crack down on clubs that offer dancing and drinking to the city's
poor.
   Illegal clubs have been a nagging headache to fire, building and
liquor officials in Los Angeles, Omaha, Neb., Gary and East
Chicago, Ill., and Lawrence, Mass.
   ``We arrest them on misdemeanor charges, and they can open up
again in a week,'' Omaha police Lt. John Beers said.
   Omaha police found a locked front door and about 220 people in
two small rooms when they raided the Dirty Dozen Motorcycle Club
Sunday. ``If there had been a rush to get out, those people would
have been trampled,'' Beers said.
   In Lawrence, Mass., outside Boston, there may be three or four
illegal clubs operating, Fire Chief Raymond Johnson estimated.
   ``We shut them down and two weeks later they open someplace
else,'' Johnson said. ``I guess it's a very lucrative business.''
   In Los Angeles, a prominent club owner said aggressive
crackdowns on unsafe or illegal nightclubs have failed to stop chic
underground clubs from flourishing and evading detection by fire
officials.
   ``I myself go to these places,'' said Steve Banerjee, who owns
legal Chippendales clubs on both coasts. ``It's the whole theory of
do something you shouldn't do. You think you are part of the `in'
crowd, the `aware' crowd.'' Many big-city officials say they seldom
or never see such establishments.
   ``That's bootlegging in Texas and we would shut them down,''
said Randy Yarbrough, assistant administrator for the Texas
Alcoholic Beverage Commission. Officials in Boston, Detroit, San
Francisco and Orange County, Calif., were among those saying they
didn't believe their cities had a problem with illegal clubs.
   Some officials hoped news of the Happy Land disaster could boost
support for inspection efforts for legal and illegal clubs alike.
   Said Lawrence Fire Chief Johnson: ``Now they will use this as an
example.''

<HEAD>Soviet Spokesman Says Foreigners Asked to Leave Lithuania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet government today ordered foreign
journalists, businessmen and diplomats to leave Lithuania, in
another move by Moscow to assert more control over the Baltic
republic.
   ``Foreigners have been asked to leave the borders of Lithuania
and temporarily refrain from entering its territory,'' Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told a Moscow briefing.
   Diplomats, including two Americans, had already been banned from
the republic late last week, and journalists were told they could
not travel there.
   Gremitskikh said foreign reporters currently in Lithuania would
be allowed to stay until their previously announced departure
dates, but ``Those who have not yet entered will not be allowed to
enter Lithuania.''
   The Soviet government has frequently closed areas of ethnic
unrest to foreign correspondents, claiming their presence tends to
exacerbate the situation and that their lives might be endangered.
   There have been no ethnic clashes reported in Lithuania, and the
only reported violence since its March 11 declaration of
independence broke out today when Soviet soldiers began to round up
Lithuanian deserters.
   Foreign reporters must give the Foreign Ministry 48 hours'
notice and an itinerary whenever they travel out of Moscow.
   The ban on foreigners in Lithuania was an additional measure
taken to fulfill a March 21 decree by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on ``protecting the rights of Soviet citizens on the
territory of Lithuania,'' Tass reported.
   On Saturday, the government asked all foreign diplomats to leave
Lithuania and requested foreign journalists to ``temporarily
refrain from trips'' there.
   Two U.S. diplomats based in Leningrad were among those affected
by the order.
   Under Gorbachev's decree, the Soviet government has also ordered
tightened control on the Lithuanian border, asked citizens to
surrender their hunting rifles and to refrain from joining
voluntary civil defense units.

   Prosecutors are investigating whether owners in
a corporate chain that includes the husband of actress Kathleen
Turner may share responsibility in the fire deaths of 87 people in
an illegal nightclub.
   The Cuban immigrant accused of torching the club to avenge a
romantic snub was under a suicide watch in a psychiatric ward today
after allegedly telling police he set the blaze because ``the devil
got into me.''
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was charged with murdering 87 people by
setting fire Sunday to the jammed Happy Land social club in the
Bronx.
   Miss Turner's husband, Jay Weiss, acknowledged through a
statement by his lawyer that he and a partner are principals of
Little Peach Inc., which leased the club site in 1985 from a
corporation controlled by real estate developer Alex DiLorenzo III.
Two years later Little Peach sublet the two-story building to Elias
Colon, who operated the Happy Land club.
   Colon died in the fire.
   The statement by the lawyer, Roger Boyle, said Weiss' company
``has been actively pressing eviction proceedings against Mr. Colon
and had hoped that a final eviction would have resulted from a
trial scheduled for Wednesday of this week.''
   The statement said Weiss and his partner, Morris Jaffe, ``are
horrified at the events of this weekend and lament the loss of life
which ensued.''
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson has said he has 10
assistants working on prosecuting Gonzalez and also ``working on
the investigation of whether or not there is any possible
responsibility, criminal liability, on the part of the club and-or
the owner of the building.''
   Across from the fire-blackened club in an impoverished
neighborhood near the Bronx Zoo, families on Monday drifted in and
out of Public School 67, where agencies helped arrange funerals and
offered counseling and financial aid.
   Anger was directed at Gonzalez' former girlfriend, Lydia
Feliciano, when she appeared at the school to inquire about aid for
friends.
   ``I can't believe she is here. How could she show her face?''
said Edgardo Rodriguez, 22, who lost four friends and was awaiting
information on financial aid to send their bodies home to Honduras.
   When asked why she came to the school, Ms. Feliciano responded,
``I lost people too. I lost friends.'' As a crowd gathered around
her, two police officers escorted Ms. Feliciano out of a back
entrance of the school.
   A huge wooden cross stood in front of the nightclub's ruins as
neighbors prayed at an outdoor service conducted in English and
Spanish. The service Monday ended with the singing of ``De
Colores,'' a song about brotherly love.
   At the direction of Mayor David Dinkins, authorities visited 241
clubs citywide from midnight to 7 a.m. Monday and posted orders on
187 of them to vacate.
   Police issued 52 safety violations and 30 summonses, said Sgt.
Dick Vreeland.
   Police said Gonzalez had vowed to ``shut this place down'' after
an argument with Ms. Feliciano, a Happy Land employee who had split
with the unemployed Gonzalez several months ago.
   ``I got angry, the devil got into me, and I set the place on
fire,'' Gonzalez told authorities, according to a police source who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Gonzalez was arraigned on 87 counts of murder committed in the
course of arson; 87 counts of murder by depraved indifference to
human life; one count of attempted murder, and two counts of arson.
He entered no plea.
   Johnson, the Bronx district attorney, said he hoped Gonzalez
would get consecutive sentences amounting to 2,000 years in prison
if convicted.
   Gonzalez, who was jailed for army desertion in Cuba in the
1970s, came to the United States from Cuba on the 1980 Mariel
boatlift. He told immigration officials he had portrayed himself as
a drug trafficker to get kicked out of Cuba, The New York Times
reported.
   The victims of Sunday's fire, many of them Honduran immigrants,
suffocated, burned or were trampled to death. They had to ``choose
between a wall of fire or retreating and dying of asphyxiation,''
Johnson said.
   Police believe five people escaped: three patrons; Ms.
Feliciano, and the club disc jockey, Ruben Valladares.
   Valladares was listed in critical but stable condition today at
Jacobi Hospital with burns over 30 percent of his body. Ms.
Feliciano and the others escaped serious injury. Ms. Feliciano is
in protective custody.
   Johnson said Gonzalez had described the following sequence:
   After arguing with Ms. Feliciano, with whom he sought to resume
a relationship, he was ejected from the club.
   He bought $1 worth of gasoline at a nearby station, returned and
faked making a telephone call when he saw someone. When that person
left, he poured gasoline between the street and an inside door and
ignited it.
   Gonzalez watched it burn for awhile, making statements to at
least two witnesses about his role in the fire. Then he went home,
where police found him a few hours later, his shoes reeking of
gasoline. He made a videotaped admission to police.
   Johnson said Gonzalez knew the two-story club lacked windows,
rear exits and adequate staircases. He also knew how crowded it was.
   ``He is a double animal,'' said Rene J. Mena, whose son, Rene
Jr., 30, died in the fire. ``Here, they're going to have good food
for him, a book, a movie. In Central America, we don't do it that
way.''
   A vacate order was issued in 1988 against the club and again a
year later because Happy Land lacked a proper sprinkler system,
exits, emergency lighting and signs. It also had no liquor or
cabaret license, Dinkins said.
   Dinkins discussed Sunday's tragedy while addressing garment
workers Monday commemorating New York City's Triangle Shirtwaist
Co. fire, which occurred exactly 79 years before the Happy Land
blaze. The 1911 tragedy claimed 146 lives and transformed workplace
safety laws around the country.
   ``The sight of those bodies, lined along the walls like so many
wax figures, and the realization of the panic and the pain they
must have suffered in their last moments, will remain with me for
the rest of my life,'' Dinkins said.

   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk today accused Vietnam of seizing control of two of his
country's provinces and annexing several islands.
   ``The most serious threat to the survival of Cambodia is the
modification by Vietnam of the frontiers of Cambodia,'' Sihanouk
told a news conference.
   He claimed Vietnam redrew the two countries' shared border,
invaded the provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondulkiri and annexed
several offshore islands with the consent of the Hanoi-backed
Cambodian government led by Hun Sen. He did not elaborate.
   There was no immediate comment from the Vietnamese government.
   He also reiterated charges that Vietnamese soldiers remain in
Cambodia despite Hanoi's much-publicized troop pullout last fall.
He said 1 million Vietnamese settlers are in the country, in some
places making the Cambodians an ethnic minority.
   Many of the Vietnamese settlers moved to Cambodia to escape
fighting during the Vietnam War.
   Sihanouk, who resigned earlier this year as president of the
three-party resistance coalition, said general elections were
impossible until the Vietnamese settlers were removed.
   ``Hun Sen's government gave them citizenship, but that's not
acceptable to us. Hun Sen's decisions are illegal,'' he said.
   Sihanouk also repeated denials of cooperating with the Communist
Khmer Rouge faction in the coalition.
   Hundreds of thousands of people died during agrarian reform and
resettlement imposed by the Khmer Rouge when it ruled before
Vietnam's invasion in late 1978, and there is concern that the
group would regain power if the Hun Sen government is dismantled.
   ``I am not pro-Khmer Rouge. I am not red, not even pink,''
Sihanouk said.
   He said his forces and the Khmer Rouge occupy neighboring
territories in Cambodia and when ``we attack the same enemy, a
common enemy, how can we avoid seeing each other?''
   Sihanouk in late February returned to Cambodia after an 11-year
exile. At the news conference in his Beijing residence, he handed
out a glossy brochure showing his quarters in one of Cambodia's
liberated zones.
   He returned to Beijing this month because his mother-in-law has
been hospitalized in the Chinese capital and is said to be near
death.

   The husband of actress Kathleen Turner is one of
the landlords of the illegal social club where arson killed 87
people, his lawyer said today.
   Roger Boyle said in a statement that Jay Weiss and a partner,
Morris Jaffe, principals of Little Peach Realty Inc., leased the
Bronx site in 1985 from Clarendon Place, a corporation controlled
by Alex DiLorenzo III.
   Little Peach sublet the property in 1987 to Elias Colon, who
operated the Happy Land social club and was one of the 87 who died
there early Sunday.
   Boyle added that Little Peach had been trying to evict Colon and
an eviction trial was scheduled for Wednesday.
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson has said his staff was
working on sorting out the ownership of the building and looking
into whether anyone in the corporate chain bears criminal liability
in the deaths.
   Miss Turner and Weiss married in August 1984 after a romance
that started when he helped her find a Manhattan apartment.
   MIss Turner, who starred in movies such as ``Body Heat,''
``Romancing The Stone,'' and ``War of the Roses,'' is starring on
Broadway in a revival of ``Cat On a Hot Tin Roof.''

   A 26-year-old woman who was the world's only
recipient of a heart-liver-kidney transplant has died of hepatitis,
hospital officials said today.
   Cindy Martin died at 6:04 p.m. Monday at Presbyterian-University
Hospital, spokeswoman Lisa Rossi said. Mrs. Martin underwent a
21{-hour transplant operation Dec. 2-3.
   Mrs. Martin had contracted recurrent non-A, non-B hepatitis, an
unusual and non-contagious form of the liver disease, which
resulted in kidney failure, Ms. Rossi said. Her condition also was
complicated by an overwhelming infection called sepsis, a common
post-transplant complication.
   Because of anti-rejection drugs, which suppress the immune
system, infection is a common problem with transplant patients, Ms.
Rossi said.
   There was no sign of rejection to her heart, she said.
   Word of Mrs. Martin's death was not released until this morning
at the request of her family, Ms. Rossi said.
   Although multi-organ transplants have been performed several
times, this was the first involving these three organs, according
to Dr. John Armitage, who performed Mrs. Martin's heart transplant.
   Since the surgery, her condition never improved beyond serious
and she was often breathing with the aid of a respirator, Ms. Rossi
said.
   Her family, including her husband, John, were with her when she
died.
   Mrs. Martin had suffered from familial cardiomyopathy, an
inherited heart disease. Her father died when he was 31 and many of
his relatives died at a young age, her husband said in December.
   On Oct. 20, 1985, one day after getting married, Mrs. Martin was
admitted to Presbyterian-University Hospital to await her first
heart transplant. She received it a month later, but suffered
chronic rejection of the heart and developed hepatitis and kidney
dysfunction.

<HEAD>Bishop Appeals to East Germans to Show Humaneness to Honecker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berlin's Roman Catholic bishop today urged
East Germans to treat ousted and ailing Communist leader Erich
Honecker with humaneness.
   ``As a clergyman, I believe that everyone should be given the
chance to live out his life in peace, no matter what he has done,''
Bishop Georg Sterzinski told The Associated Press.
   Honecker, 77, has been living at a parish home outside East
Berlin since January, after being kicked out of an exclusive wooded
compound previously reserved for top Communist officials.
   The compound was closed after a peaceful popular revolt swept
Honecker and his hard-line Communist government from power in the
fall. It is now being used as a home for the mentally retarded.
   Honecker ruled East Germany with an iron fist for 18 years until
his ouster in October.
   He is reported to be in poor health. He was arrested in January
after leaving a hospital following surgery for kidney cancer but
was released a day later because of his ailing condition. He and
his wife have been living in virtual exile at the church refuge
since then.
   An attempt last weekend by the outgoing Communist-led government
to move Honecker and his wife to a more comfortable residence 80
miles from Berlin was thwarted by an angry mob.
   More than 100 people surrounded the home and forced authorities
to move the couple back to their church residence after only one
night. Dozens of people banged the roof of their car with their
fists and made obscene gestures as the Honeckers were driven away.
   Honecker's wife, Margot, is a former education minister.
   Sterzinski said East German citizens should try to ``prevent
their hate from running freely.''
   He said Honecker should be given better accommodation and should
not have to live in constant fear of being thrown out.
   ``If I knew what I could do, I would do it (to help Honecker),''
the bishop said.
   On Monday, East Germany's chief prosecutor said there were no
legal grounds to prosecute Honecker for high treason, but he
remains under investigation for massive corruption and abuse of
power.

TV Marti debut. Picks up 3rd graf pvs `The Cuban...'</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A U.S.-financed television operation began
transmitting signals to Cuba early today, but Cuban officials
blocked the transmission after 38 minutes and accused the United
States of engaging in aggressive activity.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed the debut of TV
Marti and said the administration planned to continue efforts to
transmit news and entertainment programs programs to Cuba despite
the successful jamming effort.
   ``We just hope that at some point they see the light,''
Fitzwater said, alluding to Cuban officials. He said the operation
was consistent with national and international law.
   The TV test operation began at 1:30 a.m. EST and was clearly
visible on Channel 13 in the Havana area until the jamming began at
2:08, said a Voice of America official, who asked not to be
identified by name.
   The Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said in a
dispatch monitored in Mexico City that ``the debut was nothing
impressive since in a 10-minute interval the principal
technological power on the planet could not keep the invading
signal from being rejected over the coverage area.''
   ``Cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and Washington may
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression,'' the
dispatch said.
   The Cuban government, the agency said, ``has placed
responsibility on the government of that country for all the
consequences of this action, which is aggressive and violates its
sovereignty.''
   Official Cuban statements have said retaliatory measures besides
jamming would be taken, but none was announced immediately, the VOA
source said.
   The station is designed to be a TV version of Radio Marti, which
has provided news and entertainment to Cuban listeners since 1985.
Radio Marti was not jammed this morning.
   Cuban officials, in addition to jamming Channel 13, also blocked
the signals on several other channels, the VOA source said.
   He said that at 3:45 a.m. EST TV Marti switched from the test
pattern to baseball highlights and musical programming but these
signals were jammed as well.
   The signal was sent from a transmitter placed aboard a balloon
dangling 10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key off the south Florida Coast.
Technical problems have delayed testing for months.
   After the testing, the administration is supposed to make a
legal and technical evaluation of the operation within three
months, according to the legislation.
   If the operation proves feasible on both counts, formal
programming can begin for a two-year period. The funds already have
been appropriated.
   But if the testing interferes with Florida stations or violates
aspects of international law governing such broadcasts, the
operation will be scrapped. The administration has promised to stay
within the law.
   President Fidel Castro has reacted sharply to TV Marti.
Americans, he said recently, ``are not even capable of knowing how
much they offend the hearts and sentiments of our people.''
   ``They know it violates international law; they know it violates
national sovereignty,'' he said.
   TV Marti's sponsors maintain it is an effective way to bring
objective information to the Cuban people via television. They say
that Cubans have been fed only propaganda for all 31 years of the
revolution.
   Cuban officials have said a range of options are being
considered in retaliation for TV Marti.
   Among others, they said that telephone communications and travel
between the two countries might be suspended.
   Another possibility is that Cuba will activate transmitters
capable of blocking U.S. radio broadcasts over a huge area west of
the Mississippi.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said today there have been
``preliminary discussions'' with Mexico on the feasibility of a
U.S.-Mexican free-trade pact.
   President Bush proposed such an agreement during his 1988
presidential campaign, saying trade barriers should be dropped
throughout North America.
   A free-trade agreement took effect between the United States and
Canada in January 1989 under which virtually all tariffs, quotas
and other trade barriers between the two countries will be
abolished by the turn of the century.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``there have been
preliminary discussions ... but no negotiations, no final decisions
and we really haven't gone very far down that road yet.''
   Noting Bush's campaign promise, Fitzwater said, ``he would like
to see a Northern Hemisphere dedicated to free trade.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported in today's editions that the
United States and Mexico had agreed to negotiate a free-trade pact
between the two nations.

   A teen-ager who challenged a law
restricting driver's licenses of school dropouts has regained the
right to drive, but only because he turned 18.
   Michael Means celebrated his birthday Monday by paying the state
$72.50 for his license, which was stripped from him 18 months ago
when he quit school. West Virginia in 1988 was the first of several
states to enact a law punishing dropouts by revoking their licenses
until they return to school or come of age.
   ``I sort of forgot how to drive, almost,'' Means said after
taking his father's car for a drive.
   Means is still pressing a lawsuit that is pending before the
state Supreme Court. The youngster, who is unemployed, blames the
law for costing him potential jobs and forcing him, his 17-year-old
wife and 7-month old son to rely on his parents for support.

   The director of Cuba's state tobacco company
Tuesday challenged a leading European cigar merchant to taste test
to determine whether the quality of Cuban cigars has declined.
   Franciso Padron, director of Cubatabaco, issued the challenge at
a news conference to counter complaints made by tobacco merchant
Zino Davidoff.
   Davidoff's company, based in Switzerland, is traditionally the
supplier of cigars for Europe's wealhy industrialists and bankers.
It broke its contract with Cubatabaco last year, contending that
the quality and consistency of Havana cigars had dropped.
   Padron proposed a televised taste test in which cigar
connoisseurs would judge the quality of Cubatabaco's La Havana
cigars.
   ``Zino Davidoff hasn't been to Cuba for 20 years and he knows
nothing about Cuban cigars,'' said Padron, puffing on a La Havana
during the news conference.

   Members of Amnesty International demonstrated
outside the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday against the scheduled April 3
execution in California of Robert Alton Harris.
   Harris, 37, was convicted of killing two teen-age boys in San
Diego in 1978. If put to death as scheduled in the gas chamber, he
would be the first person executed in California in 23 years.
   About 30 demonstrators left a letter for U.S. Ambassador Henry

George Deukmejian to exercise clemency.
   ``Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases
as abuse of the right to life and the right not to be subjected to
cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment,'' the letter
said.
   ``We are particularly concerned that this case will create a
precedent for other states in the United States which are not
currently carrying out execution,'' the letter said.
   ``We will continue campaigning until Harris is either executed
or the death penalty rescinded,'' said Amnesty International
spokesman Sarah Lee.
   The U.S. Embassy had no comment on the protest.

<TEXT>
   The government imposed a dusk-to-dawn
curfew and banned meetings and protests as political, professional
and trade organizations prepared to draw up guidelines Tuesday for
a new party to lead Gabon to democracy.
   Opposition movements and the Gabon Trade Union Confederation had
called for demonstrations Tuesday, but the capital of this West
African nation was calm.
   Police squads guarded the main intersections of Libreville. The
official Gabon Press Agency announced Monday night that security
police and troops had been deployed around the city.
   ``Those who provoke incidents or sabotage will be severely
punished, and those who organize protest marches will be arrested
immediately,'' a state radio broadcast warned.
   It announced a ban on meetings of more than five people, and a
curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m.
   All the measures appeared aimed at preventing incidents that
might disturb the National Conference, which began meeting under
the chairmanship of President Omar Bongo.
   About 150 organizations are taking part in the meeting, which is
to establish a new party called the Social Democratic Rally.
   ``Divisions fed by resentful people .... can only hinder our
march toward a more democratic society,'' Bongo told the meeting,
which is scheduled to end April 2.
   Bongo agreed last month that the new party would be a broad
grouping of various political movements and replace the Democratic
Party, with which he has ruled Gabon as a one-party state since
1968.
   The president also has promised to install a multiparty state in
Gabon, but has set no date.
   Bongo said the conference would define ``conditions for a
framework to work toward a multiparty state.'' This transition
period will expose the country to ``an uncertain future, letting
loose arbitrary and dangerous outbursts,'' Bongo said.
   He appealed to ``the patriotism of everyone,'' and urged an end
to strikes and unrest that have shaken his government recently.
   Bongo's government survived an October coup attempt, which was
followed by months of strikes and civil unrest.
   On Friday, scores of unemployed people went on a rampage in
Gabon's economic capital, Port Gentil, breaking shop windows,
looting stores and setting cars aflame.
   Gabon is in the third year of an austerity program imposed as a
condition of further credit from Western nations and institutions.

   About half a billion people worldwide are
suffering from tropical diseases such as malaria, river blindness
and sleeping sickness, the World Health Organization said Wednesday
as it launched a campaign to fight the illnesses.
   WHO officials appealed for more funds to pay for research and
control programs for the ``great neglected diseases.'' It said they
pose a risk of infection to the entire population of the African
continent and much of Asia and South America.
   The U.N. agency's new campaign will focus attention on the seven
most widespread tropical diseases, which can cause internal organ
damage, limb deformities, blindness, brain damage and death.
   Dr. Shaik Khader Noordeen, a senior official in WHO's tropical
diseases division, told a news conference that lack of money
prevented effective use of preventive measures and drugs to counter
the diseases.
   ``A lot can be done today, but it is not being done simply
because the resources are not available in the endemic countries
and the awareness is not present in the countries that could help
them,'' he said.
   Dr. Alvaro Moncayo, another WHO expert, said the organization's
current research budget into tropical diseases was $65-70 million
spread over a two-year period.
   WHO's 1990 budget for its program on AIDS totals $109 million.
   ``These diseases affect the poorest of the poor,'' Moncaya said
when asked why he thought tropical diseases had not received the
same attention as AIDS.
   A WHO report said most victims of tropical diseases live in
countries with average per capita incomes of less than $400, and
where governments spend a yearly average of just $4 per person on
health care.
   The 26-page report said malaria claimed the highest number of
victims. It estimated that 270 million people carry the parasite
spread by infected mosquitos, with 110 million new cases each year.
It put the annual number of fatalities at 1 million to 2 million.
   The report said 2.1 billion people live in areas of the Third
World where they are at risk. The parasite is showing increasing
resistance to common drugs, it said.
   Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by water-borne parasites from
snails, afflicted about 200 million people, destroying internal
tissues and contributing to malnutrition, according to the report.
   More than 110 million people suffer from filariasis, caused by
mosquitos and blackflies. It leads to river blindness, or
onchocerciasis, a disease transmitted by flies that causes tumors,
skin lesions and blindness. Filariasis may also lead to a painful
swelling of the limbs known as elephantiasis, it said.
   WHO also singled out for concern chagas disease, found in
Central and South America and occasionally in the United States. It
said there were 16-18 million cases of the disease, caused by a
parasite transmitted by a bloodsucking bug that lives in crevices
of poor-quality houses.
   In later stages of the disease, the parasites invade body organs
and eventually cause irreversible damage to the heart and
intestines. The disease is said to be incurable but can be
prevented by insecticides, better housing and health education.
   A fifth disease, sleeping sickness, is transmitted by the bite
of the tsetse fly in several parts of Africa. The report said early
diagnosis was difficult and for the 25,000 people who contract the
disease each year, it was invariably fatal.
   It said insecticide spraying and tsetse traps had proved
successful as preventive measures.
   It estimated that 12 million people were infected with
leishmaniasis, caused by a sandfly bite. Some 400,000 new cases
occur each year, with victims suffering ailments ranging from
ulcers to chronic tissue destruction.
   In a glimmer of hope in the otherwise gloomy report, WHO said
leprosy had recently become controllable by treatment involving
three drugs. By the end of last year, 1.75 million of the 4 million
registered patients had received the therapy.
   WHO estimates there are 10-12 million cases of leprosy worldwide.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Wednesday urged Argentina
to investigate allegations of torture, disappearances and killings
of members of an opposition group who attacked an army barracks
last year.
   The human rights organization published a report detailing
violations against members of the small leftist Movement for the
Fatherland, which tried to take over an army base on the outskirts
of Buenos Aires.
   Twenty-eight attackers and 11 soldiers and police officers died
in the Jan. 23, 1989 attack on La Tablada base. Sixty law officers
were wounded and 13 attackers were arrested.
   Amnesty urged Argentina's president, Carlos Menem, to order an
inquiry. In its 21-page report, the group said there ``appears to
be strong evidence'' that two attackers listed as being killed in
combat were summarily executed after surrendering.
   The report also said three others disappeared after being
captured and that there was medical evidence to support prisoners'
allegations they were tortured while in official custody.
   Amnesty International said Argentina's attorney general promised
prompt investigations into these complaints last April. By the end
of the year, the investigating magistrate had reached a decision in
only one case.
   Amnesty International's report also said some investigations
were flawed. It cited autopsy procedures, which it said were not of
a high enough standard to determine whether deaths had occurred in
combat or were the result of executions.
   The report alleged that security forces raided private homes,
often without warrants, following the attack on the base. It said
they threatened and in some cases tortured suspected sympathizers.
   Armed plainclothes officers reportedly stormed one home without
formally identifying themselves or producing a warrant, tortured
the couple, raped the wife and threatened to kill their
11-month-old child, the document alleged.
   Four women and 16 men, including a Roman Catholic priest, were
convicted in October of planning or carrying out the attack on the
military base and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life in
prison.
   The attackers said they believed a military coup was imminent
and that it was being coordinated at the barracks by rebel officers.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia's once-powerful Buddhist
monks, nearly wiped out during seven decades of Communist rule, are
cautiously joining the new pro-democracy movement in hopes of
winning freedom from state control.
   When crowds first began rallying in December to demand free
elections and other reforms, only one young monk, Baasan, dared
join in.
   But buoyed by the successes of the activists in winning the
ouster of top Communist officials, Mongolia's only surviving
monastery has ventured into politics for the first time since the
days of Bogd, a ranking monk who was king from 1911 to 1915.
   Gandan Monastery's agenda is short: it wants abolition of the
State Committee on Religion, which regulates religious activities,
and freedom to open more temples and monasteries.
   ``We would like to expand our religious activity ... train more
monks and publish sutras,'' or scriptures, said Gaandan, the
monastery's hamba lama, or leading monk.
   Mongols, like Tibetans, believe in lamaist Buddhism, a mix of
Buddhism and tantric ritual. Monks are called lamas.
   Gaandan said he believes lamas can be forces for good in
Mongolian politics. But he has no dreams of a return to the
pre-Communist days, when Mongolia's more than 700 monasteries and
temples wielded great power and absorbed half the male population
as lamas.
   ``There may be several hundred'' monasteries in a few years if
controls are lifted, he said, ``but not 700. Quality is more
important than quantity.''
   The monasteries were closed in the late 1930s, reportedly at the
urging of Soviet leader Josef Stalin and on the pretext that they
harbored Japanese spies and weapons.
   Their priceless gold and silver statues were sold, shipped to
the Soviet Union or destroyed. Their lands were nationalized and
monks were forced to find secular work. About 14,000 monks were
killed, according to official figures.
   Government propaganda denounced the lamas as exploiters. A
poster still hanging in the State Central Museum shows a lama with
his mouth opened wide, swallowing up herds and people.
   In 1944, the government allowed Gandan in Ulan Bator to reopen
but barred its monks from preaching outside monastery grounds. It
now has about 160 lamas. Gaandan said the government plans to
reopen two more monasteries this year.
   On March 11, several thousand Buddhist believers, lamas and
members of the leading opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic
Association, held a rally at a former temple in Ulan Bator that has
been turned into a museum and demanded it be reopened for worship.
   They announced the formation of a non-official Union of
Mongolian Believers to promote religious interests, the first
independent religious group in Mongolia in decades.
   When several dozen pro-democracy activists held a two-day hunger
strike for democratic reform in mid-March, lamas came to pray for
them, Baasan said. He played an increasingly prominent role in
protests organized by the Democratic Association.
   Last week, Gandan Monastery sent a letter to the Great People's
Hural, or legislature, asking it to disband the Committee on
Religion.
   The hamba lama's aide, Dorjgotov, said leaders from the
democracy movement and the government have begun coming frequently
to talk with Gaandan in the evenings. ``They don't come officially,
but as human beings,'' he said.
   The hamba lama said he is open to both.
   ``According to Buddhism, everybody must be under compassion,''
he said. ``So our attitude will be the same to the current
(Communist) party and to the democratic forces.''
   So far, no one seems worried about such issues as separation of
religion and politics, or whether the lamas could someday regain
political power.
   ``It's impossible,'' said
   Ulankhu, a member of the opposition Social Democrats, said that
would be impossible because the Communists ``completely destroyed
the system; there are so few monks.''
   Their influence over Mongolia's 2 million people also is in
doubt. Dorjgotov insisted that most Mongolians remain Buddhist,
despite the atheist education system.
   Many youths in Ulan Bator say they do not believe, although they
have been culturally influenced by Buddhism. Some support its
revival as a moralizing force, especially regarding protection of
nature, which Buddhists revere.
   Buddhism also has appeal as part of Mongolia's national
heritage, which only recently could be celebrated after decades of
emphasizing socialist internationalism.
   ``An entire world is behind that word, lamaism _ our ancient
philosophy, mathematics, linguistics, pharmacology _ our whole
culture,'' said Dr. G. Boshigt, a physician and leading member of
the Democratic Association.
   ``Even if the lamas don't make political demands, they will
represent a political force.''

   President Bush will travel to Toronto on April
10 for talks with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and to
attend the Toronto Blue Jays opening baseball game, the White House
said today.
   The Blue Jays' opponent will be the Texas Rangers, the team of
which Bush's oldest son, George Walker Bush, is a part-owner.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and
Mulroney will meet ``to discuss bilateral and international issues
of mutual interest, particularly the changes taking place in
Europe.''
   ``They will also attend the opening day game between the Toronto
Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers,'' said Fitzwater, who dodged a
question on whether Bush or Mulroney would get to throw out the
first ball.
   It is a night game. Bush will fly to Toronto Tuesday afternoon
and return to the White House late that night, Fitzwater said.
   Bush is an avid baseball fan. He told reporters last week he
wanted to find a way to attend an opening game as long as the
public did not view it as ``frivolous.''
   The baseball season is getting off to a belated start on April
9, a week late, including a Rangers-Blue Jays game in Texas.
Baseball owners had locked players out of spring training camps for
more than a month before the two sides reached a contract agreement.
   Bush, once captain of the Yale baseball team, attended several
games last year, usually flying up by helicopter to nearby
Baltimore to see the Orioles play.

   At his direction, she drove him to the bank and waited for him.
   ``He went inside the bank, said `give me the money or someone's

said.
   After a few minutes inside, he jogged back to the car.

   A court Tuesday sentenced writer Francoise
Sagan to a six-month suspended sentence for drug possession and 37
other people, including members of Paris' jet set, received
sentences that ranged up to 15 years.
   They were the first sentences handed out following a trial of 45
people arrested in connection with a drug ring that supplied
literary and social personalities with heroin and cocaine.
   The heaviest sentence went to Andre Trihan, described as a
one-time link in the now dismantled French Connection. He received
a 15-year sentence for his conviction of importing heroin into
France.
   Ms. Sagan, 54, never appeared in court and was not present for
the sentence. She was ordered to pay about $1,750 in fines as well
as $63,160 to French Customs. The sentence will go on her record,
the court said.
   She was one of 10 members of Paris' literati jet set tried for
drug-related offenses. Others included the journalist Francois
Debre, son of a former premier, who received a six-month suspended
sentence; and Laura Travelli-Picasso, the ex-wife of a grandson of
painter Pablo Picasso. She received a three-month suspended
sentence and a fine.
   Police arrested Ms. Sagan last year after reportedly finding 300
grams of cocaine and 300 grams of heroine in her Paris home.
   The writer gained an international reputation with the
publication in 1954 of her first novel, ``Bonjour Tristesse.'' She
has written more than a dozen best sellers, plays and screen plays.
   Lucien Carrel, 65, said during the trial that he furnished
heroin and cocaine for ``le Tout-Paris,'' an expression referring
to the jet set. He was given a 12-year prison term.
   The trial started March 5 and ended March 16.
   The sentences were considered light. Prosecutor Jean-Paul
Bazelaire had asked for a partially suspended sentence of six
months to two years for Ms. Sagan and 18 years for Trihan.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Would Take in More Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration wants to take more
Soviet refugees this year than the 60,000 who came in during the
year that ended last September 30, an official told Congress on
Tuesday.
   Princeton N. Lyman, head of the State Department's Bureau for
Refugee Programs, said Bush and Congress will consult later this
year to set the level.
   However, for budget purposes, he said his office had asked
Congress to provide money for 110,000 admissions, 40,000 of them
from the Soviet Union and 5,500 from Eastern Europe.
   The request also provides for another 29,000 immigrants from
Vietnam, 23,000 from countries in East Asia such as Thailand which
has given refugees emergency asylum, 6,000 from the Near East and
South Asia, 3,500 from the Western hemisphere and 3,000 from Africa.
   He added that the administration puts high priority on getting
Congress to pass a special bill to accommodate more Soviets.
   ``We want to be able to expand opportunities for Soviet refugees
to come to the U.S. ... as our fair share of the number pressing to
leave there,'' he said.
   He agreed with a private refugee support organization that more
should be done by the United States and other countries to help
refugees throughout the world. Lyman said there are 15 million
refugees worldwide, up from 12.6 million in 1988.
   Roger P. Winter, director of the unofficial U.S. Committee for
Refugees, complained of reduced government spending. In 1985 the
U.S. budget for aid to refugees provided $20 per person which is
now down by about half, he said.
   The comments came in testimony to the House Appropriations
Subcommittee on Foreign Operations.
   Panel chairman, Rep. David R. Obey, said the administration's
total request for money to help refugees is $30 million below last
year's level.
   Rep. Matthew F. McHugh, D-N.Y., read Obey's statement since the
Wisconsin Democrat was absent due to illness.
   ``Programs for children fare even worse in the administration's
request,'' Obey added.
   He cited a decrease of $23 million in money for population
programs and a $15 million decrease in the requested contribution
for UNICEF, the United Children's Fund.
   Obey compared those figures with a $345 million increase in
requested military aid and $245 million in economic support for
Third World countries.
   He said the Agency for International Development is setting
aside $75 million for countries reforming their economic policies.
   ``If reform doesn't take place does government funding get cut
while children don't receive immunization or education?'' he asked.
   Mark L. Edelman, AID deputy director, said economic growth is
the basis for development in the Third World.
   ``Without such a growth-oriented base, improvements in the
prospects of children will not occur or will be short-lived,'' he
added.

   The Census Bureau is increasing the number of
telephone help lines, after receiving nearly 50,000 calls over the
weekend, the agency said Tuesday.
   The toll-free service for people with questions about the census
opened Friday with 390 lines available. The total is now being
increased to 460 lines.
   Lines for Spanish-speaking callers were a particular problem,
officials said, and they are being increased from 88 to 160.
   ``The volume of calls we're receiving means there is a high
degree of awareness and support for the census. But obviously we
don't want people to get a busy signal when they call and we're
taking steps to make sure that they don't,'' said census director
Barbara Everitt Bryant.
   The assistance lines are staffed from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., local
time, seven days a week.
   The numbers are:
   English: 1-800-999-1990.
   Spanish: 1-800-283-6826.

   Lithuanian President Vytautas
Landsbergis today accused Moscow of ``inexcusable aggression'' and
demanded that it return at least 23 Lithuanian army deserters who
were beaten and dragged from hospitals.
   ``The government of Lithuania demands the return of its
kidnapped citizens,'' Landsbergis said in a letter to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He also urged negotiations with
Moscow ``in neutral territory.''
   The letter's angry tone and the Soviet army's decision to round
up the deserters marked a new, more volatile stage in the open
confrontation between Lithuania and Moscow, which began March 11
with the republic's declaration of independence. The beatings
reported during the round-up of Lithuanian deserters were the first
violent action by Moscow since the declaration.
   Soviet soldiers raided two hospitals where the Lithuanian
deserters had sought refuge, and witnesses said some deserters were
beaten as they were taken from a decaying psychiatric hospital in
Vilnius. A trail of blood led down the steps and out the front door
of the hospital.
   ``They beat them with their fists,'' said a duty nurse at a
psychiatric hospital where windows and iron beds were broken in the
predawn raid.
   Landsbergis said he feared it could presage a full-scale
crackdown on his Baltic republic.
   ``It is obvious that the Soviet armed forces have been given
permission to use violence,'' Landsbergis said.
   The Soviet Union today also ordered all foreigners to leave
Lithuania, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said in
Moscow. Last week diplomats and foreign journalists were told they
could not travel to the republic.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater refused to
criticize Moscow for today's actions, saying ``we do not want to
inflame the situation.'' President Bush has urged Gorbachev not to
use force against Lithuanians.
   At a news conference at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, Deputy
Ambassador Sergei Chetverikov said the Soviet Union would continue
to try to ``find peaceful solutions'' to the unrest in Lithuania
but said certain steps by troops were necessary to protect law and
order and Soviet installations.
   About 4,000 opponents of Lithuania's independence drive attended
a Vilnius rally today that Landsbergis had warned might turn
violent and serve as Moscow's excuse to intervene.
   A Soviet military helicopter dropped leaflets on Monday urging
people to attend today's rally.
   The rally lasted less than an hour and remained peaceful _
protesters did not even trespass on the grass in the middle of the
square near the parliament building. Inside, parliament officials,
convinced the crowd might try to storm the building, had rolled out
fire hoses to repel attackers.
   In all, the official Soviet news agency Tass said troops seized
23 deserters in two hospitals.
   Rita Dapkus, spokeswoman for the Lithuanian Bureau of
Information, said Soviet troops beat 12 Lithuanian deserters ``and
the militiamen who came to defend them'' at the psychiatric
hospital before taking the deserters away. She said the 26 others
at the hospital escaped.
   There were no reports on the extent of injuries. Lithuanians
have fled the Red Army, complaining of beatings and other abuse
since their republic took moves to leave the Soviet Union.
   Soviet troops also took over the republic's showcase Communist
Party headquarters today, making it the fifth party building to be
seized since Sunday in Moscow's bid to assert sovereignty in the
republic.
   Speaking to reporters today, Landsbergis denounced the ``open
acts of aggression'' and accused Soviet authorities of fabricating
stories of provocation to justify the use of force.
   Lithuania's Communists broke with Moscow in December, but a
pro-Soviet minority in the party has tried to rally against the
pro-independence majority.
   Until the weekend, Moscow had tried to intimidate the
Lithuanians with non-violent tactics. The Kremlin paraded tanks
through the capital and ordered Lithuanians to surrender firearms
and not to attempt a takeover of Soviet-controlled enterprises.
   The Lithuanians did not budge and Soviet troops began seizing
Communist Party buildings. In official media, the Kremlin portrayed
the small peaceful republic as in a state of anarchy and accused
its leaders of planning to jail opponents of independence.
   Tensions seemed to ease with the opening of negotiations between
Soviet military representatives and Lithuanian leaders on Sunday.
   But army helicopters later dropped leaflets inviting people to a
rally today to protest the ``abyss of independence.'' The move
clearly was aimed at playing on the fears of Russian and Polish
minorities, who comprise 20 percent of the state's 3.8 million
people.
   In Kaunas, 65 miles west, Soviet soldiers seized another
hospital serving as sanctuary, a police officer said. The officer,
who did not identify himself, said two young men were arrested and
troops were not allowing local police onto hospital grounds.
   Moscow had warned that Lithuanian soldiers not returning to
barracks by last Saturday would be arrested. Lithuania contends the
youths were illegally drafted into an army of occupation.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania in 1940 along with
the two other Baltic republics of Estonia and Latvia, where
pro-independence movements are also strong but more cautiously
working toward a break with Moscow.
   A Lithuanian Interior Ministry official and a Lithuanian
journalist both said on condition of anonymity that two Lithuanian
police officers were beaten by the soldiers when they tried to
intervene.
   An ABC television crew arriving at the scene was held at
gunpoint and forced to surrender all its videotape.
   Gen. Valentin Varennikov, commander of Soviet land forces, was
quoted by Tass as saying the arrests were necessary because:
``Deserters, who have become militants in the Sajudis nationalist
organization, were undergoing special training ... in one of the
buildings of the hospital.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov today told a news
conference that a U.S. Senate resolution passed last week on
Lithuania ``can even detonate the difficult and explosive situation
in the republic.''
   The Senate on Thursday urged the Soviet Union to halt its
intimidation of Lithuania and urged President Bush to consider the
republic's request for diplomatic relations.

   The Academy Awards celebrated movies low in
budget but rich in talent as ``Driving Miss Daisy'' took the Oscar
for best picture and actress, while ``My Left Foot'' won for best
actor and supporting actress.
   Jessica Tandy, who played the combative Southern widow who'd
rather walk in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' became the oldest performer
to win an Oscar at age 80.
   A surprised Miss Tandy wondered aloud why the producers cast an
actress whose career has mostly been on stage to play a lead in a
movie.
   ``I think I'm very lucky they trusted me with such a wonderful
part,'' she said backstage at the Los Angeles Music Center. ``I
never thought of myself as a movie actress.''
   The movie, about the widow's growing friendship with her black
chauffeur, won four prizes, the most of any in the 62nd annual
Academy Awards on Monday night. It took screenplay honors, for
Alfred Uhry's adaptation of his Pulitzer Prize-winning play, and
the makeup Oscar.
   Daniel Day-Lewis was named best actor for ``My Left Foot,'' the
emotional account of artist-poet Christy Brown's battle against
cerebral palsy. Brenda Fricker, who played Brown's selfless mother,
won for supporting actress.
   The Civil War movie ``Glory'' drew three prizes, and another
high-priced war film, ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' won two, best
director for Oliver Stone and best editing.
   Denzel Washington, who played a runaway slave turned soldier in
``Glory,'' got the supporting actor Oscar. The account about a
black Union regiment that fought in the Civil War also gathered
trophies for cinematographer Freddie Francis and for best sound.
   ``My son said he was going to make one of these out of clay for
me, now I've got a model for him,'' an exultant Washington said as
he held up his gold statue, first award of the evening.
   Stone won a directing Oscar for the 1986 movie ``Platoon.''
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' the account of Ron Kovic's
passage from gung-ho soldier to disabled anti-war protester, was
among the most hyped Oscar contenders, as was its star, Tom Cruise.
   But Academy voters seemed determined to ignore the efforts of
the immodest, favoring instead those films whose path to the screen
was more unconventional.
   The award for art direction went to ``Batman,'' which was the
top moneymaker of 1989 at $251 million but failed to win a
nomination in any other category. Another top box-office draw,
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' won for sound effects
editing. The Oscar for visual effects went to the $60 million
underwater thriller ``The Abyss.''
   The makers of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' on the other hand, had to
cut the production budget almost in half _ to $7.5 million _
because studios feared it wouldn't be a commercial success. It is.
It has grossed $74.5 million.
   ``My Left Foot'' was made for a paltry $3 million and
distributed by independent Miramax Films.
   ``Miss Daisy'' was dropped by MGM-UA and picked up by Warner
Bros., which provided only part of its budget. Producers Richard
and Lili Zanuck found foreign financing and slashed their costs to
get the film made.
   The movie's director, Bruce Beresford, wasn't even nominated for
an award, a fact lamented by several award winners and presenters.
In his opening remarks, show host Billy Crystal described ``Driving
Miss Daisy'' as ``the movie that apparently directed itself.''
   ``My Left Foot'' carried the imprint of one man, too _ Christy
Brown.
   ``For everyone involved in the film, all our desire to make the
film, all the strength that we needed, all the pleasure that we
took in making the film came from Christy Brown,'' Day-Lewis said.
   The Dublin-born Miss Fricker gave thanks to ``Christy Brown,
just for being alive, and to his mother, Mrs. Brown. Anybody who
gives birth 22 times deserves one,'' she said, referring to the
Oscar.
   Italy's ``Cinema Paradiso,'' a reminiscence of growing up in a
Sicilian village, was named best foreign film.
   The announcement of the foreign film award came after an
ear-rattling satellite feed from Moscow, where Jack Lemmon and
Soviet actress Natalya Negoda announced nominees with a triple echo
reverberating through the sound system. There also were satellite
feeds from Australia, Argentina and England.
   The show, seen by an estimated 1 billion viewers in 90
countries, ran a long 3 hours and 34 minutes.
   Disney's much-praised animated fairy tale ``The Little Mermaid''
won two Oscars _ best song for the calypso ``Under the Sea,'' and
best original score.
   Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, director of such classics as
``Rashomon,'' ``The Seven Samurai'' and ``Ran,'' received an
honorary Oscar.
   In his acceptance speech the 80-year-old master struck a humble
note, saying, ``I really don't feel yet that I have grasped the
essence of cinema.''
   ``Henry V'' took the prize for costume design. Tom Schulman,
author of ``Dead Poet's Society,'' won for best original screenplay.

   A crowded ferry boat capsized when
passengers scrambled to save a child who fell overboard, and at
least 47 people drowned, news reports said today. Fifty-six others
were missing.
   The privately owned boat was carrying 153 people back from Burma
after a day's trip when it sank Monday during high tide in the Naff
River in southern Bangladesh, the United News of Bangladesh
reported.
   The river separates Burma with Bangladesh near Tekhnaf. The area
is 180 miles south of Dhaka.
   The news agency quoted survivors as saying the ferry swayed and
sank after the passengers hurried to rescue a child who fell into
the river from the boat. The child was among the dead.
   Among the dead were 24 women and five children.
   The news agency quoted local officials as saying the final death
toll would be higher because many of the missing were presumed
dead. Rescuers recovered 47 bodies. Fifty people either swam to
safety, or were rescued by fishermen.
   ``The river was on high tide and many bodies are likely to have
carried downstream,'' said Habibur Rahman, who was rescued by
fishermen.
   The trip was part of a border accord with Burma under which
people from both countries travel to each other nations for
sightseeing and shopping.
   Monday's disaster was the fifth river accident in Bangladesh in
the past three months. Four previous accidents occurred in January
in which a total of 33 people died. Boats are the most popular
means of transport in Bangladesh, a low-lying nation crisscorrsed
by rivers.
   The Bangladesh Shipping Department said at least 2,000 people
have died in 218 ferry accidents since 1971 when the nation was
born.

   The Bush administration today refused to
criticize Moscow for seizing army deserters in Lithuania, saying,
``We do not want to inflame the situation.''
   The restrained U.S. reaction marked a sudden change in tone
after repeated expressions of White House concern about possible
use of force and intimidation by the Kremlin against the breakaway
Baltic republic.
   Refusing to characterize the Soviet seizure of deserters, White
House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We simply are not
going to try to give definition to words like force and
intimidation.''
   A Soviet diplomat in Washington, Sergei Chetverikov, defended
the action by quoting Vice President Dan Quayle as saying that
every army should have some discipline.
   On Monday, Fitzwater had said the Soviet army's occupation of
Communist Party buildings in Lithuania marked an escalation of
developments. However, he declined to characterize the latest
actions as a further escalation.
   ``I choose not to do it today,'' Fitzwater said. ``We simply
don't feel inflammatory language is helpful. We do not want to
inflame the situation.''
   Fitzwater acknowledged that a blowup in Lithuania could disrupt
U.S.-Soviet relations, which are proceeding warmly toward expected
arms agreements this year.
   ``We have made it clear that the relationship is one of the
factors at stake here,'' Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department, a spokeswoman said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III had not yet received an answer to a message he
sent Sunday to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze. But
Margaret Tutwiler noted that Shevardnadze had been away on a trip
to Africa and said Baker expects to receive an answer in the coming
days.
   Tutwiler denied reports that in his private message to
Shevardnadze, Baker proposed a deal whereby the United States would
refrain from criticizing Soviet actions in Lithuania in return for
a Soviet promise to refrain from using force. ``There was
absolutely, positively no deal or agreement,'' she said.
   In the Lithuanian capital, Soviet soldiers stormed two hospitals
to seize at least 23 Lithuanian army deserters in the first violent
action by Moscow since Lithuania declared independence.
   ``They beat them with their fists,'' said a duty nurse at a
psychiatric hospital where windows and iron beds were broken in the
predawn raid.
   On Saturday, Quayle told reporters in Phoenix that while the
Soviet Union should not threaten Lithuania, ``If the Soviet Union
is applying disciplinary measures to people in their own military,
that's a different situation.''
   ``I do not know what kind of contractual agreement a member of
the Soviet army has when he or she signs up,'' Quayle said.
   But there is a ``certain element of discipline that is
absolutely imperative in any armed force,'' Quayle said.
   The vice president's spokesman, David Beckwith, said today, ``He
in no way countenanced the violent rounding up of deserters.''

<TEXT>
   Fear for the survival of 180 endangered
squirrels atop an isolated mountain led a judge to block the start
of construction on what could become the world's most powerful
observatory.
   U.S. District Judge Alfredo C. Marquez on Monday granted a
four-month injunction barring the University of Arizona from
beginning construction on the first two of at least three
telescopes at the planned $200 million Mount Graham International
Observatory.
   If all goes smoothly with the first two telescopes, a third
device that would have the viewing power o a telescope more than 37
feet in diameter is planned for the mid-1990s.
   The judge said serious questions had been raised over whether
the construction would cause irreparable harm to the Mount Graham
red squirrel.
   ``I'm surprised. I'm encouraged,'' said Dr. Robin Silver, a
spokesman for the Maricopa County Audubon Society. ``This has been
a tough process all along. I'm encouraged that the system can still
work.''
   The university has decided to appeal, spokesman Steve Emerine
said today.
   Mount Graham in the Pinaleno Mountains in southeastern Arizona
is the only known habitat for the 180 remaining squirrels.
   In 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded in a
biological report for the U.S. Forest Service, the site's landlord,
that the telescopes could coexist with the squirrel. Arizona's
congressional delegation then pushed through legislation ordering
the Forest Service to grant the university a permit for
construction.
   But environmental groups sued, contending that perching the
telescopes on an 8.6-acre site on one of Mount Graham's three peaks
would assure the extinction of the 8-ounce squirrels by taking away
more of the forested land they need to survive.
   University officials contend poor pine cone crops in recent
years have hurt the squirrel population. They said hunting,
logging, use of off-road vehicles and Christmas tree-cutting have
been stopped because of the planned observatory, and that 60 to 80
acres will be reforested.
   In closing arguments, lawyers for the university and the Justice
Department said that the congressional act precluded any further
environmental review of the squirrel's habitat in connection with
the first three telescopes.
   But Marquez said Monday he had some questions about whether the
wildlife service's ruling was ``preordained.''
   He asked Justice Department lawyer Larry Bradfish, ``What's the
harm of saying there are some very serious issues here and
Congress, you have 120 days ... why don't you take another look at
it?''
   University officials said they were disappointed by the ruling.
   U.S. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said he did not think Congress
would take new action.
   ``There would have to be a major change in the status of the
squirrel or an alteration of the biological facts. Absent that, I
can't see any reason for Congress to act,'' Kolbe said.
   Two biologists who took part in the wildlife service study
alleged in depositions that officials at the agency ordered
researchers to argue in favor of construction.
   The agency's regional director, Mike Spear, upheld the study as
``biologically sound.'' But last month, after the construction site
was designated as a critical habitat, Spear called for another
study.

   Lawyers trying to block the first execution in
California in 23 years made a last-ditch appeal to the federal
courts.
   Attorneys Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe filed a 114-page
petition in U.S. District Court late Monday seeking a stay for the
April 3 execution date of Robert Alton Harris, convicted of killing
two teen-age boys in 1978.
   Even as the appeal was being filed, Nobel Peace Prize winner
Mother Teresa was pleading with Gov. George Deukmejian to spare
Harris' life. Deukmejian, during a five-minute telephone
conversation, told her that ``the public has overwhelmingly decided
that the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment'' for
convicted murderers, according to a statement from the governor's
office.
   About 30 members of Amnesty International demonstrated against
the execution outside the U.S. Embassy in London today.
   The human rights organization left a letter for the ambassador
saying, ``We are particularly concerned that this case will create
a precedent for other states in the United States which are not
currently carrying out execution.'' The 37-year-old Harris withdrew
from a scheduled clemency hearing Tuesday, saying Deukmejian's
longtime advocacy of the death penalty prevented him from receiving
a fair and impartial review before the governor.
   U.S. District Judge William Enright scheduled a hearing for 3
p.m. Wednesday.
   If Enright rejects the stay request, the defense lawyers' next
move would be to file a petition with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals. A denial at the 9th Circuit would leave only an appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which has denied Harris' appeals four times.
   Harris could be the first person executed in the gas chamber at
San Quentin since 1967, when Aaron Mitchell was put to death for
the murder of a Sacramento police officer.
   Repeating arguments that were rejected by the state's high court
earlier this month, the defense lawyers in their petition claimed
that Harris was wrongly characterized during his 1979 trial as a
sociopath who killed for pleasure and was incapable of remorse.
   More recent evaluations and studies indicate Harris' violent
behavior was the product of an abusive childhood, ``organic'' brain
damage causing him to act impulsively and lingering effects damage
caused by his mother's heavy drinking while pregnant with him, the
petition said.
   The lawyers also claimed that it was cruel and unusual
punishment to have Harris live under the threat of death for 11
years and that it would be wrong to execute him now. They said
Harris is a changed man.
   Harris shot and killed the boys and stole their car for use in a
bank robbery. He had abducted the youths as they sat in their
parked car at a drive-in restaurant, ordered them to a remote spot
and then shot them.

   Sir Winston Churchill's grandson, saluting
Dwight D. Eisenhower on behalf of his wartime ``comrades-in-arms,''
joined Americans today in honoring the man who led Allied armies to
victory and became the 34th president of the United States.
   ``It was under the command of General Eisenhower that Europe _
or at lest half of it _ was liberated,'' Winston S. Churchill told
a joint meeting of Congress held to honor Eisenhower on the
centennial of his birth.
   ``How thrilled he and Churchill would be today, to see the
peoples of Eastern Europe at last emerging as free nations from a
nightmare of 50 years' occupation, first under the Nazis, then the
Soviet Red Army,'' Churchill said.
   ``He will forever be revered among those nations who, like my
own, were his comrades-in-arms and remembered with abiding
gratitude by those nations which were liberated, under his command,
from the most monstrous and vile tyranny that has ever defiled this
earth,'' Churchill said.
   Later, at a White House luncheon, President Bush said Eisenhower
was ``a healer, not a hater'' and credited him with helping to
bring peace to the world.
   ``Welcome to the house that Ike and Mamie graced,'' Bush told
the luncheon audience that included family members and many friends
of the Eisenhowers. ``Every president admirers other presidents ...
And so today I say it proudly and very proudly: I always liked
Ike,'' Bush said.
   John S.D. Eisenhower, son of the Republican president who served
from 1953 to 1961, said, ``I believe he would like to be thought of
simply as the Good Soldier.''
   ``He walked with kings but never forgot his home in Abilene,
Kansas,'' Eisenhower said. ``He was the vaunted warrior who hated
war. He was the five-star general who warned of the dangers of an
unbridled military-industrial complex.''
   Walter Cronkite, retired CBS television news anchor, saluted
Eisenhower as ``the greatest hero of the greatest war in history.''
   ``No man did more to rid our planet of the Nazi scourge,''
Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, himself a disabled veteran of
World War II, said in prepared remarks.
   ``No one gave more in the Cold War against human enslavement,''
said Dole, from Eisenhower's home state of Kansas. ``And no one
deserves more gratitude from a world waking up to its own
potential.''
   Members of Eisenhower's family, including several
great-grandchildren, and surviving members of his administration
joined senators and representatives in the chamber. Many wore red,
white and blue ``I Like Ike'' buttons. The Army Band played a
medley of Armed Forces melodies and ``The Battle Hymn of the
Republic.''
   Eisenhower, who died 21 years ago on Wednesday, spoke 10 times
in the House chamber himself.
   The first time, June 18, 1945, he was supreme commander of the
Allied Expeditionary Force, returning from Europe to a hero's
welcome that included a joint congressional meeting.
   One-quarter of the 100 members of the current Senate and 18
members of the 435-member House served in World War II.
   The second time Eisenhower spoke to a joint meeting of Congress,
on Feb. 1, 1951, he was supreme allied commander of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and appealed for arms and leadership
to resist communist aggression.
   As president from 1953 to 1961, Eisenhower delivered seven State
of the Union addresses to joint sessions of Congress _ which are
more official in nature than joint meetings.
   On Jan. 5, 1957, he went before Congress with a special message
outlining his ``Eisenhower Doctrine'' of military and economic aid
in the troubled Middle East.
   Eisenhower was born Oct. 14, 1890, in a house that is now part
of a state park in Denison, Texas. He was one of seven sons of
David and Ida Eisenhower. One of the sons died in infancy.
   When Dwight was less than a year old, the family moved to
Abilene, Kan., where the future president grew up and where he
Eisenhower Presidential Library now stands.
   After West Point and his rise to supreme command in Europe,
Eisenhower was twice elected president by large margins in
campaigns remembered for red, white and blue buttons reading ``I
Like Ike.''
   The Dwight David Eisenhower Centennial Commission, established
by Congress to observe the 100th anniversary, has planned
observances throughout the year, including a hometown celebration
in Abilene on Eisenhower's birthday.

   ``Rocky'' fans have lost another round in
their bout to return a bronze statue of their hero to the top of
the Art Museum steps, where it had stood before the skyline as
Sylvester Stallone did in the movie.
   The Art Commission voted 4-3 Monday to prevent the statue from
being placed permanently anywhere on the museum grounds. Under the
city charter, the commission has final say about the placement of
art objects on public land.
   In another 4-3 vote, the commission turned down a recommendation
by the Fairmount Park Commission to return the statue to the top of
the steps for up to a year.
   The Art Commission said it would consider a suggestion to put
the statue in the Italian Market, the neighborhood that was home to
the fictional Rocky Balboa in the award-winning film.
   The statue, commissioned for ``Rocky III,'' had been moved back
to the museum steps earlier this year to be used in the filming of
``Rocky V.'' Rocky fans wanted the statue left there, but museum
president Robert Montgomery Scott said the statue is a movie prop _
not art _ and demanded it be moved.
   Despite objections from James Binns, an attorney hired by
Stallone, the statue was returned a month ago to a spot outside the
Spectrum sports complex.
   The Art Commission decided then to give itself 60 days to find a
permanent site for the statue. A month remains in its timetable.

   The deputy mayor of education says she is sending
her eldest daughter to a suburban private academy because the
quality of education in Chicago is poor.
   Lourdes Monteagudo, who was appointed in May by Mayor Richard M.
Daley, said the girl is a freshman at North Shore Country Day
School in Winnetka, where Monteagudo's former husband lives.
   Even if the girl lived with her every day on Chicago's Northwest
Side, Monteagudo said, she would not send her to Clemente High
School, the school she would have to attend.
   ``I don't have to apologize for it,'' she said.
   ``Prior to my appointment, I talked with my daughter, and she
decided to go to school outside of the city. ... I could not
support her staying in Chicago until the system can be reformed,
because the system is bad.''
   Monteagudo has two other children living at home. Both go to the
city elementary school where Monteagudo was principal before her
City Hall appointment.

<HEAD>Government Commission Says Racism Spreading Across France</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government commission on Tuesday said racism,
particularly against North African immigrants, is spreading in
France, and Premier Michel Rocard asked all political parties to
combat this ``threat to our national heritage.''
   Rocard made his appeal after receiving a 400-page report from a
commission appointed to investigate what has become the country's
most pressing social problem.
   Racial tensions intensified during the six-month investigation.
This month alone, three Moroccan immigrants have been killed in
incidents that prompted protests by human rights groups.
   The Socialist government and its center-right rivals have called
for tolerance, but the far-right National Front has stepped up its
campaign against immigration.
   The commission said racism against North Africans was the most
widespread, increasing markedly in 1989. About 4 million of
France's 55 million residents are immigrants, mainly Moslems from
North Africa.
   The commission said 75 percent of French people responding to a
survey it conducted said they believe there are too many North
Africans in France.
   The report said the number of racial attacks and threats jumped
to 237 in November and December, compared to 135 in the same period
of 1988. The increase followed a nationwide controversy that
focused on whether Moslem girls should be allowed to wear Islamic
scarves to public schools.
   The controversy focused attention on immigrants' place in French
society. The nationwide debate began when several local school
officials barred Moslem girls from classes because they insisted on
wearing traditional Islamic scarves. The officials cited a law
prohibiting display of religious symbols in schools.
   The government eventually relented, saying the scarves could be
worn as long as education was not disrupted.
   Anti-Semitism also persists, the commission said, referring to
revisionist theories that the Nazi concentration camps did not
exist. It cited ``skinhead'' and facist groups as among the
culprits.
   Racism is found ``at all levels of social life and in all parts
of the country,'' said the commission, which decried the
exploitation of racial fears by political candidates.
   In incidents this month, a bus driver was charged with willful
homicide for running over and killing a 17-year-old immigrant. A
cook shot at two Moroccan brothers, killing one. And a police
brigadier was detained briefly after shooting to death a young
Moroccan who purportedly tried to escape from a police vehicle
after being arrested.
   The report said political and civic leaders need a two-pronged
approach _the will to enforce laws against racism and the foresight
to take preventative steps.
   These priorities should be coupled with efforts to enhance the
assimilation of immigrants into French society and eliminate
discrimination, it said.
   Rocard invited leaders of his own Socialist Party, the two
center-right parties and the Communist Party to a meeting April 3
to launch an anti-racism initiative. No invitation was sent to the
National Front, whose leader, Jean Marie Le Pen, has described the
political hierarchy's outcry over racism as ``indecent.''
   The recent violence, according to Le Pen, is ``directly tied to
social phenomena resulting from immigration policies which they are
directly responsible for.''

<HEAD>Late Winter Storm May Have Damaged Wheat Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colder weather slowed winter wheat development
in the Great Plains and may have caused some damage in a few
southern areas where top growth was heavier, a government report
said Tuesday.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said a winter storm
brought ``some beneficial moisture'' to the northern plains during
the week of March 19-25.
   Wheat growth in Kansas was reported excellent early in the week
before the cold front moved through.
   ``Oklahoma's winter wheat was good to fair, but freezing
temperatures damaged some fields with moderate top growth,'' the
report said. ``Cold weather slowed growth in most areas of Texas at
the end of the week.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.
   Looking at other crops, the report said fieldwork progressed
well in the Mississippi Delta as fields dried. Corn planting was
more than one-third complete in Alabama, but earlier flooding may
force some replanting.
   Rice planting continued in Louisiana, and cotton farmers
continued planting in Arizona and southern California. Tobacco was
reported in good-to-fair condition in Georgia and North Carolina,
and in fair-to-good shape in South Carolina.
   The storm in the northern plains was a hardship for livestock
and newborn calves, despite its moisture benefits for pastures and
crops, the report said. Pastures were said to be in mostly
good-to-fair condition in the Delta and East.

   President Bush told entrepreneurs from 14
African nations Tuesday that they were ``doing the Lord's work'' in
trying to find business solutions their economic woes.
   Bush met with 36 African business leaders and executives of the
African Development Bank who want to interest foreign private
investors in business opportunities.
   In a departure from usual practice, the White House press office
did not list the meeting on Bush's public schedule nor allow
reporters to cover it. The White House later released a transcript
of the president's remarks to the African Business Roundtable.
   ``You all are doing the Lord's work and are on the right track
in terms of investment,'' he said.
   ``We all recognize that Africa faces tremendous challenges,''
from poverty to disease to ``needless armed conflicts,'' Bush said.
``But Africa's most fundamental challenge ... is on the economic
development side _ harnessing the continent's natural and human
resources to create better and richer lives for all of the people
there.
   ``The key to a richer and more vibrant economy across the
continent is ... in the private sector, not in the hands of the
governments. That's why you and other African entrepreneurs
represent the bright promise of Africa's economic future working _
I hope _ more and more with America.''
   He said the business leader were ``doing exactly the right thing
in looking for investment opportunities at home, seeking support
from private investors abroad and working to develop mutually
beneficial trade relationships.''
   The executives came from Nigeria, Senegal, Zambia, Ivory Coast,
Egypt, Cameroon, Burundi, Kenya, Togo, Ghana, Zaire, Morocco,
Zimbabwe and Tunisia.
   None was from South Africa, a White House aide said.
   The African executives will make their sales pitch in Atlanta,
Dallas and New York.

<HEAD>Congress Considers Reining In Lobbyists for Foreigners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners are not always required to disclose
the millions of dollars they pay American lobbyists to promote
their point of view, witnesses told Congress Tuesday.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Penn., said he has proposed legislation to
strengthen the Foreign Agents Registration Act so foreigners will
not be able to subvert U.S. policy and national security.
   He singled out the Japanese as among the biggest spenders.
Between 1987 and 1989 the total spent by all registered agents for
Japanese entities was more than $120 million, Heinz estimated.
   The act, first passed in 1938, requires lobbyists to disclose
the amount of money they receive from foreign governments and what
they do for the fee. But it is fraught with loopholes, witnesses
said.
   Another witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee _
Owen Bieber _ said reforms are needed. Bieber is president of the
International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural
Implement Workers of America.
   ``Foreign governments and companies today are spending hundreds
of millions of dollars to influence public policy in our country,''
he said. ``The sheer amount of money and the manner in which it is
spent are distorting our political process. These excesses demand
reform.''
   Heinz said his interest was piqued recently by a case involving
Toshiba Corp.'s efforts to avoid congressional sanctions after
Toshiba Machine sold the Soviet Union precision milling equipment
used for the production of submarine propellers.
   Toshiba paid the law firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander and
Ferndon nearly $11 million to act on its behalf, Heinz said. But
Heinz said Toshiba's scores of subsidiaries were not required to
register.
   ``Registration is not presently required for most subsidiaries
or for clients where the agent did not engage in any reportable
activity,'' Heinz said.
   Heinz' bill would make three principal changes:
   _ It would force companies that are more than 50 percent foreign
owned to register with the Justice Department when they hire
lobbyists.
   _ It would repeal an exemption now granted to lawyers for
administrative or judicial proceedings.
   _ It would require all agents to file their forms on Jan. 30 and
June 30, instead of every six months from the day they registered.
   Bieber praised the legislation, but suggested it could go
further. For one thing, Congress should act to end the revolving
door between U.S. trade officials and foreign companies.
   Starting on Jan. 1, 1991, former federal officials who have been
involved in trade or treaty negotiations will be prohibited from
aiding or assisting any foreign company or government with which
they had negotiated. The ban will be in effect for a year.
   Bieber also said, ``I believe the time has come to start looking
at imposing limits on the amounts that foreign governments and
companies can spend to lobby our legislative and executive branches
of government.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the committee chairman, agreed with
Heinz that the ``act will have to be tightened up steadily as we go
along.''

<HEAD>Quick Change: From Running Harvard Office to Managing Pop Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One week Cathy McLaughlin was planning lectures
for distinguished Harvard alumni, the next she'd started a new life
with the New Kids, rock idols she now shepherds past thousands of
screaming girls.
   That's what can happen when someone makes a job switch that is,
well, totally radical.
   ``It's absolutely crazy, it's 18 hours a day,'' McLaughlin said.
``It's a big change in lifestyle, you can imagine.''
   Until last year, McLaughlin was director of alumni affairs at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. She
traded in that lofty title to become assistant road manager for one
of pop music's latest sensations, New Kids on the Block.
   So she bid farewell to the life of academia and joined a world
where the greatest joy is finding a quiet place to sleep.
   ``Every 14-year-old girl would like to meet the New Kids,''
McLaughlin said in a telephone interview this week from New Jersey,
where the group concluded a recent tour.
   ``They live and die for them,'' she said. ``And when you go to
the concert, the screams are louder than the music.''
   But how does someone go so quickly from the quiet halls of the
Ivy League to the ear-splitting crowds at rock arenas?
   Strangely enough, it was quite logical.
   McLaughlin, 28, worked with two presidential campaigns, in 1984
for Walter F. Mondale and two years ago for Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis. Her job as an advance person required her to go to cities
ahead of the candidates and plan for their arrival.
   Her work eventually got the attention of Dukakis' son, John
Dukakis, who works for the New Kids' business manager. So when the
group was looking for another road manager last year, Dukakis gave
McLaughlin a call.
   ``Anybody who's done political advance work would have the
skills and stamina to work with rock 'n' roll on the road,'' the
younger Dukakis said. ``You need an ability to adapt to changing
situations. You have to have a `can-do' attitude.''
   McLaughlin, who had been directing the Kennedy School alumni
office for about 18 months, took a leave of absence last June to
join the band for a summer tour. When she returned to her job in
the fall, the excitement was in her system. She left the post a
month later to work for the group full time.
   And in this job, full time means full time.
   Aside from scheduling the usual travel plans and interviews,
McLaughlin must be ever prepared for the unexpected. Like when the
band members suddenly want to go on a shopping spree and she has to
arrange a limousine and security staff.
   Or when parents wait outside her hotel room until 3 a.m., hoping
she'll let their kids see the Kids.
   Back at the Kennedy school, her former co-workers think her new
job is exciting.
   ``We're all living vicariously through her,'' said Steve Singer,
director of the school's press office. ``She calls in from the road
now and then and tells us stories. ...
   ``It's a lot more exciting than setting up alumni receptions,''
he said.

   Hungary's national elections were
significant in relegating the Socialist Party created by Communist
reformers to a relatively minor opposition role.
   But the vote is unlikely to bring greater political liberty to
people already enjoying most of the privileges of Western-style
democracy, nor will it quickly solve pressing economic woes.
   Voters used their new freedom to deal harshly with Old Guard
Communists, who refused to join reformers in forming the Socialist
Party last year. With most votes counted, they seemed to have been
shut out of Parliament.
   As in East Germany on March 18, voters clearly associated the
ruling Socialist Party with the dark authoritarian past, despite
its stated commitment to democracy when it was created in October.
   Hungary's rulers were the only Communists in the Soviet bloc to
opt for full democracy without mass demonstrations or violence. By
Sunday's election, their gradual embrace of reforms had created a
society as free as Western ones in many aspects.
   Laws and decrees enacted in the last two years have lifted
travel restrictions, permitted political plurality and freedom of
opinion, and removed major restrictions on free enterprise.
   Most Hungarians consider their newspapers, state radio and
television as free as the media in Western Europe.
   ``The majority of voters expressed the fact that they do not
want to legalize anything they could suspect as having anything to
do with what they know as socialism,'' said Nepszabadsag, the
former Socialist Party daily, in comments on the election results.
   The anti-Communist backlash translated into major gains for two
parties who campaigned on a platform that associated the Socialists
with past excesses.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum, a broad-based conservative party
drawing on traditional nationalist and populist sentiments, and the
League of Free Democrats, with philosophies akin to European
liberal and social democratic parties, each won more than 20
percent of the vote.
   As the chief contenders going into runoffs tentatively scheduled
April 8, both the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats are
presenting themselves as the next likely governing party, either
alone or in coalition with others oppposed to the Socialists and
Communists.
   Both advocate a market economy, although the Democratic Forum is
not opposed to a sizeable state sector if it works efficiently.
   But neither can offer immediate solutions to the economic
malaise left by four decades of rigid command economy marked by the
same inefficiency and stagnation found in other Soviet bloc
countries.
   Many unprofitable state enterprises were kept alive over the
past few years only by billions of borrowed dollars. Billions more
went into providing the population with consumer goods unavailable
in other Soviet bloc countries, creating a false picture of a
relatively well-off society.
   The new government, whatever its shape, must foot the bill. The
$20 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita within the
Soviet bloc. For years, debt servicing will absorb capital that
could otherwise finance needed domestic investment and social
programs.
   Money for such projects is chronically scarce in a country
facing growing poverty and unemployment as it prepares for the
painful changeover to a market economy. Last year's budget deficit
exceded 60 billion forints, about $10 billion.
   The lack of hard currency needed to service the foreign debt has
been exacerbated by the hemorrhage of dollars, West German marks
and Austrian schillings out of the country.
   By November, about $1.5 billion had been handed out to
Hungarians enjoying their new-found freedom to travel abroad and
claiming their $400 annual travel allotment to buy goods not
available at home.
   The government was forced to cut the allowance to $50 as a
result. But the outflow continued because of easy black market
access to hard currency for Hungarians planning a trip abroad.
   Inflation was 17 percent in 1989 for the second year in a row.
It has been fueled by the policy of allotting large raises to
workers in the state sector. Workers in other state enterprises
deemed unprofitable beyond saving are being let go, creating a
growing and restive force of unemployed.
   Recognizing that there is no quick fix for the daunting task of
economic revival, most parties repeatedly cautioned citizens
against expecting miracles from any new government.
   Reflecting popular sentiment among experts, Socialist Premier
Miklos Nemeth, an economist and one of the reform Communists most
responsible for the country's democratic turn, told a reporter that
he didn't expect the economy to markedly improve before 1995.
   Commenting after Sunday's first round of voting, Nemeth urged
the quick formation of a new government after the runoff elections
``because the state of the Hungarian economy does not permit a
vacuum'' in decision making.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Strict Limits on Campaign Spending by Corporations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld strict
limits on political campaign spending by corporations, ruling their
free-speech rights are outweighed by the need to subdue big-money
influence over elections.
   The decision was hailed by the Federal Election Commission and
Common Cause as a major victory for honest government. But the
American Civil Liberties Union said it unfairly discriminates
against corporations.
   In a 6-3 ruling, the court upheld a Michigan law challenged by
that state's Chamber of Commerce. Twenty other states and the
federal government have similar statutes.
   The laws ban corporations and trade associations such as the
Chamber of Commerce from spending money from their treasuries on
behalf of political candidates.
   The laws permit businesses and others to make such expenditures
only if they set up special funds, or political action committees,
that must keep detailed records and disclose the names of
contributors.
   Tuesday's decision does not affect corporate spending to promote
political issues submitted to voters in ballot referenda. The
ruling applies only to elections for public office.
   In other developments, the court:
   _Heard arguments over the power of state governors to withhold
National Guard troops from peacetime training in Central America. A
decision is expected by July.
   _Upheld federal regulation of payments to lawyers who help coal
miners win government benefits for ``black lung'' disability.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court, said the
Michigan campaign spending statute is justified by the state's
interest in preventing corruption or its appearance.
   The state has a compelling interest in ``eliminating from the
political process the corrosive effect of political war chests
amassed'' by corporations, he said. ``Corporate wealth can unfairly
influence elections.''
   The Michigan law was designed to prevent corporate giants, such
as major automobile manufacturers in Detroit, from funneling
millions of dollars through the Chamber of Commerce to candidates
without revealing the spending.
   Marshall also rejected arguments that the law is
unconstitutional because it exempts labor unions and media
corporations.
   Unlike those who contribute to a corporate treasury, Marshall
said, union members who disagree with the union's political
activities can withhold some of their dues without giving up their
membership.
   He added that media corporations merit exemption to protect the
role of broadcasters and publishers in reporting and commenting on
newsworthy events.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said, ``The
court today endorses the principle that too much speech is an evil
that the democratic majority can proscribe. The principle is ...
incompatible with the absolutely central truth of the First
Amendment: that government cannot be trusted to assure, through
censorship, the fairness of political debate.''
   Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor also
dissented.
   Federal Election Commission spokesman Fred Eiland said the
ruling safeguards a law that since 1907 has been the foundation of
federal efforts to control campaign spending.
   ``If this had gone the other way, it would be opening the
floodgates'' for unrestrained corporate spending, he said.
   Common Cause, a group that advocates strict control over
campaign spending, also praised the ruling.
   But Arthur Spitzer of the American Civil Liberties Union said
the ruling unfairly singles out corporations.
   ``This kind of discrimination makes no sense to us,'' he said.
He also said the decision ``is an indictment of democracy'' because
it suggests people will vote for candidates based on how much money
they spend, not what they stand for.
   The Michigan Chamber of Commerce has some 8,000 dues-paying
members, about three-fourths of them corporations.
   The chamber planned in 1985 to place a paid advertisement in the
Grand Rapids Press in support of Richard Bandstra, a Republican
candidate for the state House of Representatives.
   The trade association challenged the state campaign finance law
in federal court, fearing it would be fined $10,000 under the act.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the law was
unconstitutional as applied to the Chamber of Commerce.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1986 Supreme Court ruling
limiting the federal government's power to regulate corporate
political spending.
   The justices said then that the Federal Election Campaign Act of
1971 violates freedom of speech when applied to corporations formed
primarily to influence public opinion and not to make a profit.
   The high court in 1986 ruled in favor of a Massachusetts group
formed to protest the legalization of abortion.
   But the justices Tuesday drew key distinctions between the
Massachusetts group and the Chamber of Commerce.
   Marshall said the anti-abortion organization raised money from
its members specifically to attack abortion rights. There is no
reason to believe Chamber of Commerce funds come from people who
share the same political views, Marshall said.
   Also, he said, Chamber of Commerce members may be reluctant for
economic reasons to withdraw from the organization even if they
disagree with its support of particular political candidates.
   Michigan officials said states with similar laws to its own are
Alabama, Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Montana, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West
Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.

   An armed robber who walked out of a
jail during a jail church service and made his getaway in the
mayor's car surrendered Tuesday, authorities said.
   Dean Dilts, 25, walked out of the Newaygo County jail during the
Sunday night service, walked six blocks and stole a 1977 Buick from
Mayor Russell Gilbert's driveway, police said.
   Dilts had been awaiting an April 3 sentencing after pleading
guilty last month to robbing a restaurant in October.
   ``I went to the ice box to get me a Klondike Bar, and after
eating it I was going to get a glass of milk, and that's when I saw
the car was gone,'' the mayor said. The car was later found
abandoned in the town of Holland.
   Dilts called the police to say he was ready to turn himself in,
and was picked up early Tuesday in his hometown of Muskegon, police
said.
   Authorities have not decided if further charges will be filed.

   Two congressional staff members, reportedly on
John Poindexter's authority, were given details of a Hawk missile
shipment to Iran, according to a document introduced Tuesday at the
former national security director's Iran-Contra trial.
   The document, called a stipulation, is part of Poindexter's
effort to show that he did not try to conceal the U.S. role in the
missile shipment from Congress.
   Intelligence committee staff members Richard Giza from the House
and Edward Levine from the Senate reviewed highly classified
intelligence information at the National Security Agency on Nov.
20, 1986, the document said.
   Lawyers for Poindexter say they will show he approved Giza and
Levine going to the NSA and reviewing the data on the Reagan
administration's Iran initiative.
   The day after the visit, Poindexter briefed House intelligence
committee members and the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate
intelligence panel. He is accused of obstructing Congress and
making false statements by allegedly telling them he didn't find
out about the Hawk missile shipment until five weeks after it
occurred.
   Former NSA legislative liaison Kenneth Kodama said he watched as
Giza and Levine examined a loose-leaf notebook containing an inch
and a half of reports on the Iran arms sales.
   The reports contained information on the November 1985 delivery,
according to the wording of the stipulation, to which both the
defense and prosecution agreed.
   Another defense witness, former White House computer expert Edd
Barnes, testified that National Security Council employees were
encouraged to delete files from the computer system when they left
the NSC.
   Poindexter is accused of deleting 5,000 computer files in late
November 1986 to try to obstruct Congress in connection with the
Hawks shipment.
   Barnes testified that Poindexter was ``very aware'' of a backup
tape from which all of Poindexter's computer messages were
retrieved. The backup tape ordinarily is stripped of old messages
every two weeks, but the tape was preserved in late November
because of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Earlier, Sen. John Chafee testified as a character witness for
Poindexter.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler asked Chafee if he had formed
an opinion of Poindexter for ``truth and veracity.''
   ``He had the highest reputation for truthfulness and
character,'' Chafee said.
   Poindexter was adminisrative assistant to Chafee when the Rhode
Island Republican was secretary of the Navy in the Nixon
administration.
   Under questioning from Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb, Chafee
said he had had no discussions with Poindexter regarding how to
respond to congressional inquiries into whether Oliver North was
assisting the Contras militarily.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress North's
military assistance to the Contras as well as the U.S. role in the
November 1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran.

   It's probably the nature of the beast: The
annual Academy Awards telecast simply cannot be housebroken.
   The good intentions, the resolve that the mistakes of last
year's tacky, overstuffed show wouldn't be repeated, seem to have
gone for naught.
   Monday night's 62nd Annual Academy Awards on ABC, stretched to a
mind-boggling three hours and 34 minutes, was as bloated and boring
as ever.
   Are the Academy Awards unconquerable? Perhaps it's best to sit
back, accept that they will never improve and enjoy it? Still ...
   Even Billy Crystal, a wonderful choice for host, seemed overawed
at times. He started out very funny. His best line came after 330
movies were represented in an opening montage celebrating 100 years
of filmmaking. ``And according to Paramount, not a one of them has
gone into profit,'' he said.
   The reference to a lawsuit against Paramount over film profits
was much appreciated by the Los Angeles Music Center audience.
   Crystal's lampoon of the Oscar's usual overheated opening
production number was shorter than most thank-you speeches. And
much more enjoyable. That dancing, singing dinosaur was eliminated
from the telecast; thank goodness for small favors.
   Unfortunately, Crystal ran out of material as quickly as the
telecast ran out of steam.
   At least Snow White showed up only briefly as a cartoon in the
opening montage. Her appearance last year in the opening production
number was protested by the Disney Studio.
   The Motion Picture Academy, obviously embarrassed by last year's
show, began the show with a speech by Academy President Karl
Malden. This attempt to introduce some dignity to the show nearly
put a deadly pall over the whole proceeding.
   The Oscar telecast for the first time went international, with
remote appearances from London, Tokyo, Australia, Buenos Aires and
Moscow. Its purpose was to show that the film industry is truly
international.
   What it actually accomplished was to add another excruciating
hour to the show. The only remote that was remotely interesting was
the touching birthday tribute from Tokyo to Japanese director Akira
Kurosawa.
   On the other hand, it was feared for a time that Howard Koch, in
accepting the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award, was going to break
out his home movies.
   Most other winners, thankfully, were limited to 45 seconds.
   ``The Wizard of Oz'' is a venerable film that recently
celebrated its 50th anniversary. But what was the point in having
Diana Ross lead a round-the-world sing-along of ``Somewhere Over
the Rainbow'' as the show was coasting _ quite slowly _ to an end?
The only possible answer, and not a very good one, is that someone
wanted to dazzle us with the technical wizardry of the
multi-satellite linkup.
   Oddly enough, some of the best things about the telecast were
the commercials by Prudential Bache paying homage to movie
classics. A suggestion: Let the maker of those commercials produce
next year's Oscar telecast.

   Oscar-winning film director Oliver Stone
has apologized for wrongly depicting Syracuse police clubbing
college protesters in his movie ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Stone apologized in a letter that was sent to the Syracuse
Police Benevolent Association and addressed to all city residents.
The film won two Oscars at the Academy Awards on Monday night,
including one for Stone for best director.
   ``I took creative license to make my point, and sometimes
sacrificed smaller truths for larger ones,'' Stone wrote. ``There
is, I would like to point out, a disclaimer at the end of the film
to this effect.''
   The movie, starring Tom Cruise, is based on the life story of
Ron Kovic, and his passage from patriotic soldier to anti-war
activist.
   Based on a book by Kovic, the movie depicts city police officers
beating students during a campus protest at Syracuse University in
1970. City police officials denied that officers used violence to
stop college protests.

   Told that Robert Caro was in town, a
longtime associate of Lyndon B. Johnson cracked: ``Who let him in?''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning author says he expects to come in for
criticism in Texas for his dark portrayal of Johnson in the second
volume of his biography of the late president. But he thinks
critics are missing the point.
   ``I wanted to show the transformation,'' Caro was quoted as
saying in an interview published Tuesday in the Austin
American-Statesman.
   ``I don't write biographies just to show the lives of famous
men. I wanted to show what happened with American politics'' at the
dawn of a new age of media politics, he added. The turning point
was the 1948 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate between Johnson
and former Gov. Coke Stevenson.
   ``Nobody had ever run a campaign like that before,'' said Caro,
who in his book ``Means of Ascent'' portrayed Johnson as evil and
Stevenson as a romantic, heroic figure.
   Caro, 53, said the same vigorous reaction greeted his first
volume, ``Path to Power.''
   ``The initial reaction is controversy. After a while, all that's
left is the book. The book endures,'' Caro said.
   Rep. Jake Pickle, D-Texas, who was an aide and heir to Johnson's
congressional seat, said Caro ``made Coke a saint. We respected
Coke as a solid sort of conservative, but we didn't think of him as
a man of vision _ the saint of all Texans, he was just `Calculatin'
Coke.'''

on Academy Awards night.
   Christopher Reeve, Susan Sarandon, Ron Silver, Jennifer Beales

Gov. Mario Cuomo and state legislators Monday to promote
environmental bills.
   ``I think sometimes there's a skeptical attitude about

   The politically active artists' group have pledged to exploit
its celebrity status to promote legislation in New York state that

   ``State government has become more powerful as the federal
government has withdrawn from matters of concern to the people of

   The group supports Cuomo's proposed $1.9 billion environmental
bond act, and will identify lawmakers who try to block
pro-environment bills, Silver said.
   Environmental lobbyist Lee Wasserman said the celebrities could
prove a big boost.
   ``The reasons things don't get done on the environmental front
is the public isn't fully aware of how the process works,''
Wasserman said.

   Governments on Tuesday urged restraint in
Lithuania but in cautious statements, nearly all avoided directly
attacking Moscow after its first use of force against the
secessionist republic.
   Only Norway severely criticized the Soviet government. It called
the storming of two hospitals by Soviet troops to seize Red Army
deserters ``brutal and unwise.''
   The Bush administration refrained from denunciations, saying it
did not want to ``inflame the situation.''
   In Western Europe, the European Community appealed for ``maximum
restraint.''
   Poland's Solidarity leader, Lech Walesa, expressed grave
anxiety. In a letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, he accused
the Soviet leader of a ``violating the sovereignty of Lithuania.''
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, most of Moscow's allies made no
comment, although the news media reported fully the tense
developments in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
   The restrained comment from Washington was a change from its
repeated expressions of concern recently about the possible use of
force against Lithuania.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused to
characterize the seizure of army deserters as an escalation of
force.
   ``I choose not to do it today,'' Fitzwater said. ``We simply
don't feel inflammatory language is helpful. We do not want to
inflame the situation.''
   The 12-nation European Community issued the call for restraint
in a statement from its Brussels headquarters.
   It added that it hoped ``for a respectful, open and fair
dialogue between Moscow and Vilnius avoiding the use of force or
the threat of the use of force.''
   Most members of the community have never recognized the
incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   But at the same time, many Western European governments have
noted that Gorbachev faces what French President Francois
Mitterrand recently called ``terrible problems,'' as Lithuania and
other republics demand independence.
   In the British House of Commons, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher sidestepped demands to condemn Gorbachev and to equate the
military action in Lithuania with the invasions of Hungary and
Czechoslovakia in 1956 and 1968.
   ``Undoubtedly this is a very difficult situation, both for
President Gorbachev and the people of Lithuania,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher. ``It calls for great restraint on both sides. Force is
not an appropriate way to settle this petition ... it will not help
to be provocative in any way on either side.''
   Political officers of the 16-nation NATO alliance, who met in a
special session Monday and Tuesday in Brussels, hinted that the
hospital attacks and Moscow's show of force in Lithuania over the
weekend could damage improved East-West relations.
   ``If the situation is not solved peacefully through
negotiations, it could derail a lot of other things,'' said a NATO
official, speaking in Brussels on condition of anonymity.
   He said the officials felt that Gorbachev and the Lithuanian
leaders should negotiate in ``an atmosphere free of intimidation''
and that ``any adverse developments in Lithuania would have
consequences for positive, international political trends.''
   Similarly, Walesa told Gorbachev, ``Violating the sovereignty of
Lithuania is an action directed against the process of constructing
a new democratic order in Europe.''
   After lauding Gorbachev's reform policies and the Soviet
Communist Party's relinquishing of its monopoly on power, Walesa
said, ``I turn to you, Mr. President, to abandon the practice of
military pressure and undertake political dialogue with the
Lithuanian government.''
   Czechoslovakia said it supported the principle of ``autonomy in
whichever form a nation chooses.''
   ``Naturally we are greatly interested that the prblem with
Lithuania will be resolved in a peaceful manner way,'' added
President Vaclav Havel's spokesman, Michael Zantovsky.
   Norwegian Prime Minister Jan P. Syse called Moscow's parading of
tanks and his order to confiscate Lithuanians' firearms ``a
shockingly unwise step.''
   ``Continued use of power will not solve any problems, but can
seriously jeopardize the results recently achieved in East-West
relations,'' Syse said in a statement.
   The Netherlands, a member of the European Community, said it
worried ``about the increasing pressure ... that is being exerted
on the Lithuanian population through a military show of force.''
   In Yugoslavia, an influential weekly, Danas, predicted that
other Soviet republics may break away from Moscow.
   ``One can rightly wonder if the time for the fall of the great
(Soviet) empire of peoples, which is shaking strongly, has not
arrived,'' added Danas.

   Thousands of blacks marched
through a poor township Tuesday to protest high rents, and black
leaders denounced police for killing 14 people and wounding more
than 400 in an earlier protest march.
   Police said nine other blacks were killed during the past 24
hours in factional fighting, including seven men who were hacked to
death by a mob armed with knives and machetes in an apparent
revenge killing in Natal.
   And in Cape Town, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse 150 squatters who tried to stop municipal workers from
demolishing shacks at a squatter camp. Police said they intervened
after squatters attacked the workers with rocks, bottles and
sticks. One worker was injured.
   Black leaders criticized police for using unnecessary force to
break up a protest march Monday in the township of Sebokeng.
   Bavumile Vilikazi, a spokesman for the Vaal Civic Association
representing various townships south of Johannesburg, said police
killed 14 people.
   Police officers, who declined to be named, said five blacks were
killed and about 260 people were hurt, half of them by police. They
said the officers fired in self-defense when the armed crowd surged
forward to attack.
   Officials at the Sebokeng Hospital said nine people were killed
and 447 were treated for injuries, mostly from police shotgun fire.
   Firoz Cachalia, a prominent anti-apartheid lawyer, said legal
proceedings would be instituted against the police. He did not
specify what kind of proceedings, but black leaders contended the
demonstrators were peaceful.
   Herbert Mabuza, a photographer for the nation's largest
newspaper, The Star, said in a front-page, eyewitness account that
police broke into laughter after opening fire on the crowd. ``Out
of the blue the police started shooting,'' he said. ``I heard no
warning. I saw nothing that seemed to spark it off.''
   It was the worst confrontation between police and protesters in
recent months. Police also clashed with protesters in several other
townships near Johannesburg Monday, using shotguns, rubber bullets
and tear gas to disperse crowds. No deaths were reported.
   Hundreds of people have died in recent weeks in a wave of
political unrest.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, which organized the protest of
high rents in Sebokeng, claimed police ``excited'' the situation
and started the violence. It urged blacks to be calm and
disciplined.
   ``In most of the marches our people have been conscious of the
need to keep order and discipline, and there is never any need for
the police to take the kind of violent action they took,'' the
group said in a statement.
   Thousands of blacks marched Tuesday in Kwathema township near
Johannesburg to protest high rents. Police monitored the peaceful
march and made no move to intervene, witnesses said.

   A car bomb exploded Tuesday near a base
controlled by renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's army in the Christian
enclave, and three soldiers were wounded, Aoun's television station
reported.
   The report said the car was packed with 110 pounds of explosives
and detonated before sunset on the road to the Roumieh barracks,
base of Aoun's 8th brigade.
   The station gave no further details. Police said they had no
information on the explosion.
   Another bomb exploded under a car parked near a mosque in west
Beirut's commodore district at 8:50 p.m., wrecking two automobiles
but causing no casualties, police said. No group claimed
responsibility for either bombing.
   Aoun's troops and militiamen of the rival Lebanese Forces
militia dueled with artillery and tank fire earlier Tuesday,
killing two people and wounding four.
   Police said the artillery exchanges flared in the highlands of
Kesrouan province, 20 miles northeast of Beirut.
   The rival Christian forces also traded sniper fire in east
Beirut's residential districts of Ashrafiyeh and Badaro, police
reported.
   It was the fourth straight day of violations of a March 3
cease-fire, and it increased fears of a new round of full-scale
fighting in the war for control of the Christian enclave.
   Several Beirut newspapers and radio stations have said Aoun is
setting the groundwork for a new offensive to crush the Lebanese
Forces after receiving fresh ammunition deliveries.

   The defense rested its case today in the
Iran-Contra coverup trial of former national security adviser John
Poindexter, after 5{ days of testimony.
   The case drew to a close without any testimony from Poindexter,
who is accused of concealing from Congress the U.S. role in a
November 1985 Iran arms shipment and Oliver North's secret military
assistance to the Contras.
   Among the final witnesses for Poindexter was Rep. Robert K.
Dornan, R-Calif., who testified that there were frequent meetings
between North and up to 30 congressmen during the period of a
congressional ban on military aid to the Contras.
   At the meetings, North was told by the congressmen that ``we
don't think you are limited'' by the ban and that it was
permissible for North to help raise money for the Contras, Dornan
testified.
   Since the defense opened its case March 20, Poindexter's lawyers
have sought to portray the ex-national security adviser as a White
House official who never lied to Congress.
   He is accused of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress
and two counts of making false statements.
   ``John Poindexter is and always has been a person of the highest
... truthfulness, honesty and integrity,'' testified retired Adm.
James Holloway III, a former member of the joint chiefs of staff.
   Sen. John Chafee testified earlier in the day that Poindexter
had ``the highest reputation for truthfulness.''
   Poindexter, a retired rear admiral, had been administrative
assistant to Chafee when the Rhode Island Republican was secretary
of the Navy in the Nixon administration.
   Meanwhile, a document was introduced in court showing that two
congressional staffers knew about a November 1985 Hawk missile
shipment to Iran the day before Poindexter allegedly lied about it
to Congress.
   The document was a summary of highly classified information
collected by the National Security Agency.
   Defense lawyers plan to show that it was Poindexter who
authorized the release of the information to the staffers. That
would suggest that Poindexter had no intent to obstruct Congress
and make false statements when he testified Nov. 21, 1986, because
he had arranged the previous day for Congress to get data on the
Hawks shipment.
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler asked Chafee if he had formed
an opinion as to Poindexter for ``truth and veracity.''
   ``He had the highest reputation for truthfulness and
character,'' the senator said.
   Under questioning from Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb, Chafee
said he had had no discussions with Poindexter about how to respond
to congressional inquiries into whether North was assisting the
Contras militarily.
   Also Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene ruled that
Poindexter may not call a House staff member and former Lebanon
hostage David Jacobsen.
   Greene said Jacobsen's testimony would ``inflame'' the jury with
the emotional hostage issue. Jacobsen was held in West Beirut from
May 1985 until November 1986.
   Beckler said he wanted Jacobsen to testify about a conversation
with Poindexter on Nov. 21, 1986, the day Poindexter is accused of
obstructing Congress and making false statements about the Iranian
arms sales initiative.
   Beckler said Jacobsen could testify about conveying to
Poindexter serious concern that any inaccurate information about
the initiative could result in harm to the hostages. The judge said
the testimony would be of marginal use compared with the potential
for prejudicing the jury.
   Greene also granted a motion of the House of Representatives to
quash Poindexter's subpoena for staff member Victor Johnson.
Johnson wrote a memo in June 1986 saying that inquiring into
North's Contra-related activities would make a good political issue.
   It ``places the administration in a cover-up posture,'' Johnson
told Rep. Ronald Coleman, D-Texas. Coleman introduced a resolution
of inquiry into North's activities.
   Greene said any question of whether there was ``political
motivation'' for the resolution of inquiry is irrelevant to the
criminal case against the former national security adviser.

<HEAD>Romanian Restrictions Cited as Senate Hears Horrors of Illegal
Abortion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's strict anti-abortion law, repealed
after the uprising last winter, prompted many women to obtain
illegal abortions or perform abortions on themselves, a family
planning official from that country told a Senate panel Tuesday.
   ``This law had such terrible consequences that a major slogan of
the December 1989 uprising was `liberty, democracy, abortion,'''
Gabriella Bocec said.
   Bocec, vice president of Romania's new Family Planning
Association, said that in the 25 years that abortions were illegal
in her country, up to 86 percent of the maternal deaths were due to
illegal abortion. Thousands of children were orphaned by the deaths
of their mothers from botched illegal abortions, she said.
   She spoke as the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee
opened the first in a series of hearings on a bill establishing
broad guarantees of a woman's right to an abortion. Supporters
describe it as effectively writing into federal law the Supreme
Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, which anti-abortion advocates
seek to overturn.
   Aside from Bocec's testimony, the hearing was a replay of the
most emotional arguments available to each side in the debate over
abortion.
   House and Senate opponents of abortion described a fetus as a
human life meriting protection from the moment of conception. Rep.
Christopher Smith, R-N.J., described in graphic detail what the
various methods of abortion do to a fetus.
   On the other side, Marilyn Mosley, 52, of Birmingham, Ala.,
described how she performed an abortion on herself with knitting
needles at the age of 20. James Friedl of Concord, Calif., cried as
he described watching his mother die in 1929, in convulsions after
secretly taking a drug to induce an abortion.
   Sheri Matulis, of Peoria, Ill., described being viciously raped
and slashed in 1954. Unable to obtain an abortion for the resulting
pregnancy, she said she resorted to ``the most painful and
degrading experience of my life'' _ an illegal abortionist who did
his work with a glass of whiskey in one hand.
   She called the self-induced abortion ``horrendous.'' But she
said, ``I would do the same thing again, because I believe having
an abortion is a personal right, and no one can take that away.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a conservative considered an opponent
of abortion, questioned the witnesses and acknowledged the power of
their testimony.
   ``I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion we have to do more with
family planning,'' Hatch said.
   ``Both sides are very sincere and have arguments that have to be
listened to,'' Hatch said. ``I am so pressured I don't know what to
do right now.''
   Sharleen Richard, a Union Lake, Mich., medical sonographer,
testified that advances in technology permit high quality pictures
of the fetus in the womb and amount to a powerful argument against
abortion.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the presiding member of the
panel and a supporter of the bill, ruled she could not show
videotapes of sonographs until after the hearing. Richard also was
denied the chance to show her tapes to a House panel earlier this
month.

   Residents have blocked plans for Paul
McCartney to perform at the Yale Bowl, and the mayor says that may
mean a $350,000 loss for the city.
   Yale University said it would end negotiations with the former
Beatle because Mayor John Daniels had withdraw his support for the
concert.
   Daniels said his administration could not back plans for the
concert because residents living near the 70,000-seat stadium did
not want it used for concerts.
   ``It is extremely unfortunate because the city stood a good
chance of making as much as $350,000 from the concert at a time
when we are being forced to lay off people and cut city services,''
the mayor said Monday.
   Alderman Jonathan Einhorn, who rallied residents in his district
to oppose concerts at the Bowl, said ``no one is singling out
McCartney. As a matter of fact, he's someone of our vintage.''
   The world tour by the 47-year-old rock 'n' roller began in
Norway in September.

Repression</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A doctor on an international team
sent to investigate a myserious illness in Kosovo province Tuesday
blamed mass hysteria among ethnic Albanians for the ailment, which
has led to renewed unrest.
   Also Tuesday, news reports said Serbian authorities
administering Kosovo fired 100 ethnic Albanian police for allegedly
allowing Albanian nationalists to attack members of the Slav
minority.
   Ethnic Albanians have accused Slavs of causing the illness by
poisoning ethnic Albanian students.
   The U.S.-based Helsinki Watch human rights organization
appointed an international panel of doctors to assess the
situation. A Dutch member of the team said the group found no
evidence of poisoning or epidemics, attributing the mysterious
incident to ``mass hysteria.''
   But the doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity to The
Associated Press, said there was ``definitely no stage managing''
of the alleged epidemic.
   ``If you are a parent, and if your daughter complains of stomach
pains, and you hear other parents are rushing their children to the
hospital, you do not hesitate to do the same thing,'' he said.
   A Yugoslav parliamentary commission said Monday that 2,990
ethnic Albanians were hospitalized in Kosovo last week complaining
of lung and skin problems, but it found no evidence of poisoning.
   Serbian officials accused Albanian nationalists of organizing
the incident, saying the illness was faked.
   The Serbian police raided nine ethnic Albanian homes, arresting
six ethnic Albanians and seizing four guns, 10 gas masks and
ammunition, the official Tanjug news agency said Tuesday.
   Media reports in Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, said
Serbian police intend to purge 70 percent of ethnic Albanians from
police ranks, and 100 already have been fired.
   Kosovo is one of two provinces of Serbia, the largest of the six
Yugoslav republics.
   The majority ethnic Albanians are pressing for restoration of
the autonomy they lost March 28, 1989, when the government approved
constitutional changes that gave Serbia almost complete control
over Kosovo.
   Serbia will mark the anniversary as a holiday.
   ``The proclamation of March 28 as a Serbian national holiday
represents a provocation whose aim is to further escalate political
conflicts in Kosovo and Yugoslavia,'' read a statement from the
Democratic Union, the largest independent ethnic Albanian party in
Kosovo.
   The changes were said to be needed to protect the Serbian
minority from ethnic Albanian harassment. Yugoslav liberals and
Western human rights monitors say they have led to a series of
human rights abuses, including indiscriminate arrests, sackings and
other harassment of ethnic Albanians.
   More than 60 people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have died in
ethnic violence in Kosovo in the past year.
   Kosovo, which borders Albania, was a part of ancient Serbia.
Most of the Christian Serbs in the province view the Moslem
Albanians as intruders.

   Former President Jimmy Carter said today the
United States should use its maximum influence to nudge Israel and
its Arab neighbors to negotiate peace in the Middle East.
   Carter, just back from a trip to the Middle East, told
reporters, ``I think that there's a general acceptance now that a
comprehensive peace is not only necessary but I think inevitable.''
   How long it takes, he said, ``will depend on the people involved
and how enthusiastic others, including the United States
government, (are) in pursuing this process.''
   The United States has been pressing the Israelis to open talks
with the Palestinians. The Israeli coalition government recently
fell, not long after President Bush stirred controversy by
criticizing the settlement of Soviet Jews in East Jerusalem.
   ``I think our government ought to use its maximum influence _
not pressure _ in Israel and the other countries as well to go to
the bargaining table to find peace,'' Carter said after emerging
from a 35-minute meeting with President Bush in the Oval Office.
   Carter was asked whether the United States has pushed the
Israelis too hard to negotiate.
   ``I think what President Bush has expressed is a policy that's
been our government's ... for the last 23 years,'' said the former
president, just back from his latest trip to the Middle East.
   He remarked at the outset of the meeting with Bush, ``I was
encouraged by this trip, more than any I've had in the last 10
years.''
   Carter played a leading role in monitoring last month's
elections in Nicaragua, in which Sandinista President Daniel Ortega
lost to Violeta de Chamorro.
   It was the first time Bush and Carter had talked since the
Nicaraguan elections. Secretary of State James A. Baker III also
attended the meeting.
   Carter was overheard mentioning the situation in Lithuania as he
and Bush posed for photographers at the start of the meeting.
   Carter told reporters afterwards: ``President Gorbachev faces a
quandary: is he going to let part of the Soviet Union break off ...
and at the same time how to treat with compassion and understanding
the move that he himself has precipitated toward democracy and
toward freedom and toward the expression of independence.''
   ``I think our government has played it very well so far by
impoloring all parties not to resort to force or violence and to
resolve this in a peaceful fashion,'' said the former president.
   Asked if there was a danger U.S.-Soviet relations could unravel,
Carter said, ``There's always a danger, but I don't want to comment
on it.''

<HEAD>Defense, Commerce Weighing Action On Chemicals For Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Pentagon defended the administration's
policy of maintaining a chemical weapons stockpile on Tuesday as a
spokesman confirmed it is considering forcing two chemical firms to
sell the Army a key ingredient for poison gas.
   The Army has used up its supplies of the chemical thionyl
chloride, accrued from the 1950s, and has sought new supplies from
Occidental Petroleum Co., and the Pittsburgh-based Mobay Corp., a
subsidiary of the West German chemical firm Bayer AG, officials
said.
   Both companies have refused to supply the chemical and told the
Pentagon their corporate policies bar them from providing chemicals
that would be used in the production of chemical weapons.
   Given the firms' responses, officials from the two agencies are
conferring on what action to take.
   The administration could invoke the Defense Production Act of
1950, which gives the government the authority to compel the sale
of material to the Pentagon for reasons of national security.
   In the meantime, ``The Army is attempting to locate thionyl
chloride from other sources,'' Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall told
reporters at a briefing.
   The chemical is used to make the poison gas to fill the
artillery shells for binary chemical weapons that could be used in
battle.
   President Bush has decried the proliferation of chemical weapons
and the administration has proposed a treaty limiting their use.
But pending an international accord, the administration contends
the United States must maintain a supply of such weapons to deter
their use by other nations.
   The administration also has attempted to block the export of the
chemical to nations believed to be involved in chemical weapons
production.
   Hall noted that the next step could be up to the Department of
Commerce, which as yet has not directed the companies to provide
the chemical to the U.S. government.
   ``They have the authority under the Defense Production Act of
1950 ... to compel acceptance of defense-related production orders
by companies capable of producing the required item or material,''
Hall said.
   He noted that as the administration has moved ahead with its
plans to destroy its old stockpiles of unitary chemical weapons _
those that carry a lethal gas mixture _ it decided to move ahead
with production of binary weapons, which use two chemicals that mix
and become lethal only after being fired.
   ``As we destroy the unitary weapons stockpiles, we are producing
a small stockpile of binary chemical weapons which will serve as a
deterrence against the use of chemical weapons against the United
States,'' Hall said.
   ``There are good reasons why we want to maintain a reserve
stockpile during the process of (negotiating) the treaty ... and
particularly the binary, because they are a better system,'' Hall
said. ``We need to proceed with this small program. To do so, we
need the chemicals supplied by commercial suppliers.''
   Hall said there are other companies that could be potential
sources of the chemical, but he declined to identify them or state
whether they were able to supply the material.

   Ten cars belonging to foreign diplomats
were destroyed by a series of bomb blasts Tuesday, and an anonymous

countries, police said.
   No injuries were reported.
   The vehicles belonged to diplomats from the embassies of Syria,
the Soviet Union, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and the

   The time bombs went off within 10 minutes of each other, said

   An anonymous caller phoned the Athens daily Eleftherotypia and
claimed the ``Social Resistance'' group bombed the cars for the
``vested rights of Third World countries,'' the police spokesman
said.
   The Social Resistance organization last claimed responsibility
for terrorist attacks in November 1988, when it placed bombs
outside the Athens office of a conservative parliamentarian and an
apartment owned by Greek billionaire Ioannis Latsis. No one was
injured in the explosions.

<HEAD>US Weighs Possible INF Treaty Violations in Soviet Missile
Transfers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has told the United States it
transferred SS-23 missiles to three East European allies, but the
State Department is still not sure whether this violates a 1987
treaty, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   In response to queries from Washington, Soviet officials said
the medium-range missiles were sent to Bulgaria, East Germany and
Czechoslovakia, said Margaret Tutwiler. The United States also has
asked other members of the seven-nation Warsaw Pact whether they
received such missiles, she said.
   The United States asked the Soviets about the missiles after an
East German news report about such weapons being deployed in East
Germany.
   Both East Germany and Czechoslovakia, which have shed their
Communist governments in recent months, have confirmed to the
United States that they received Soviet missiles, Tutwiler said.
   Another official said East Germany told the United States the
missiles were transferred in 1985.
   The Czech government told the United States that the Soviets
transferred 72 missiles to their country, Tutwiler said. The Czechs
are cooperating ``fully'' with the United States which is trying to
determine what kind of missiles and when they were transferred, she
said.
   The key question is whether the missiles were transfered before
or after the signing of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces or INF
treaty in December 1987.
   If the weapons were transferred before the treaty was signed by
former President Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
they are not covered by the pact.
   If they were transferred after it was signed, the transfer would
violate the treaty.
   ``We will be unable to comment further until we have received
all responses and analyzed that information,'' she said.
   U.S. officials were disconcerted by the discovery of the
missiles, which they had not known about until now. Arms control
officials are also concerned by East Germany's decision to destroy
the missiles.
   ``We have to first determine whether these are covered by the
treaty and should indeed be destroyed,'' said one official. ``It
has to do with setting the record straight and giving credibility
to verification procedures,'' said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The question of verification is one of the stickiest in
negotiations under way for halving the U.S. and Soviet arsenals of
long-range intercontinental missiles. Gorbachev and Bush have both
said they would like such a treaty completed in time for their June
summit.
   The INF treaty bans all U.S. and Soviet missiles with a range of
between 300 and 3,400 miles.

   Preliminary studies in mice suggest
that an air pollutant may hasten the spread of cancer within the
body, a researcher said Tuesday.
   Mice with cancer that breathed air containing nitrogen dioxide,
which is found in smog, showed higher numbers of cancer-cell
colonies in their lungs than mice than breathed purified air, said
Arnis Richters.
   ``It is very difficult to say at this point, what does it mean
for human populations,'' said Richters, an associate professor of
pathology at the University of Southern California School of
Medicine in Los Angeles.
   He spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the American
Cancer Society.
   In other presentations, researchers said doctors often overlook
a warning sign for cancer in the mouth, and said a new treatment
strategy appears promising for cancer of the esophagus.
   About 11,500 new cases of cancer of the mouth are diagnosed each
year; an estimated 10,600 new cases of cancer of the esophagus are
expected to be diagnosed this year, and 9,500 people will die from
it.
   In the mouse study, animals breathed air with nitrogen dioxide
levels ranging from 0.25 to 0.5 parts per million. Such levels can
be reached in Los Angeles' notoriously dirty air, Richters said.
   After breathing the air for six weeks to six months, the mice
were injected with skin-cancer cells. Sixty days later, their lungs
were examined to see if cancer had colonized there. The mice were
particularly prone to get lung colonies from the skin cancer,
Richters said.
   Studies showed that breathing air with nitrogen dioxide damaged
the linings of tiny blood vessels in the lung, which may trap
circulating cancer cells and provide an environment for them to
grow, he said.
   The pollutant also reduced numbers of cells that form part of
the disease-fighting immune system, he said.
   He recommended that cancer specialists try to find places with
filtered air for their patients just before and after surgery, when
more cancer cells may be released into the bloodstream.
   Common cancers in humans that tend to spread to the lung, a
process called metastasis, include those of the colon, breast and
prostate.
   Lance Liotta, chief of the National Cancer Institute's section
of tumor invasion and metastasis, said the concept of Richters'
paper ``makes sense.''
   Previous work has shown that lung damage can increase the
efficiency of metastasis to the lung, he said.
   But he said it will be difficult to see whether air pollution
raises lung metastasis in humans because so many other factors are
involved.
   In another presentation, Dr. Arthur Mashberg of the Veterans
Administration Medical Center in East Orange, N.J., said dentists
and doctors often overlook an early sign of cancer of the mouth.
   Doctors tend to look for white growths called leukoplakia as an
early sign of the cancer, but a red lesion that persists for 10 to
14 days with no apparent ongoing irritation is actually more
ominous, he said.
   Only about 11 percent of leukoplakias are cancerous, but some 64
percent of red lesions called mucosal erythroplasias are cancerous,
he said.
   The third presentation dealt with treating cancer of the
esophagus.
   Traditional treatment includes radiation or surgery. Dr.
Lawrence Coia of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
reported on a combined treatment of chemotherapy and radiation,
without surgery.
   Being able to avoid surgery is an advantage, because the
operation itself is dangerous and survival from the disease still
is low, commented Roy Sessions of Georgetown University.
   Coia said half of patients whose disease had been confined to
the esophagus lived more than 18 months after the experimental
treatment, with a corresponding figure of eight months for those
with more advanced disease.
   Under traditional treatment with either surgery or radiation,
half of patients die within a year, he said.

   Baptism traditionally promises the cleansing of
sin. Not so for Carmen Tortora, whose alleged ``rebirth'' could
mean 50 years in prison.
   Authorities say the 43-year-old Tortora became a Mafia
``soldier'' during a secretly taped blood initiation that confirmed
an underworld of solemn oaths and codes of silence so vivid in
popular imagination.
   ``Carmen. ... You were baptized when you were a baby, your
parents did it, but now this time we gonna baptize you,'' an
alleged Mafia lieutenant told him during the induction detailed in
a 113-count federal indictment unsealed Monday.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the tape recordings
of the ``secret, clandestine operation'' provides unprecedented
proof that could help convict 21 accused mobsters, including the
reputed boss of the Mafia in New England.
   All but two of those indicted were in custody Tuesday, a day
after the FBI launched a dragnet through Rhode Island,
Massachusetts and Connecticut, authorities said.
   They were held on charges including murder, racketeering,
kidnapping, drug trafficking, gambling, obstruction of justice and
witness intimidation.
   Thornburgh said Monday that in his 20 years investigating
organized crime, people often have asked whether the Mafia blood
rite truly exists. The question was answered ``once and for all,''
he said, on Oct. 29 in an unremarkable house on a modest street in
suburban Medford.
   ``This is the first time that you're going to hear it right from
their own mouths,'' said Dennis O'Callaghan, assistant special
agent in charge of the five-year FBI investigation.
   Tortora and three other men allegedly were inducted at the boxy,
clapboard home during a Sunday ceremony presided over by reputed
crime boss Raymond ``Junior'' Patriarca, who was arrested Monday at
his Lincoln, R.I., home.
   Authorities said that on that partly sunny autumn day, many
leaders of New England's most powerful crime family came to Medford
for the ``baptism'' of new members, one of whom was on a day's
leave from prison.
   Tortora was the only initiate named in the indictments, but 11
of the 17 alleged mob leaders at the ceremony were among those
charged, authorities said.
   There, before Patriarca and his ``soldiers,'' Tortora pricked
his ``trigger'' finger and recited in Italian: ``I ... want to
enter into this organization to protect my family and to protect
all my friends. I swear not to divulge this secret and to obey,
with love and omerta.''
   Omerta refers to the code of silence, which was explained to
each new member: ``We get in alive in this organization and the
only way we gonna get out is dead,'' mobster Biagio DiGiacomo said,
according to authorities.
   ``It's no hope, no Jesus, no Madonna, nobody can help us if we
ever give up this secret to anybody. ... This thing cannot be
exposed,'' he said, according to court documents.
   ``This thing'' refers to La Cosa Nostra, which in English means
``this thing of ours,'' officials said.
   Tortora, a bald man with a hangdog face, then cupped a flaming
holy card bearing a picture of the Patriarca's family saint in his
hands while vowing: ``As burns this saint, so will burn my soul. I
enter alive into this organization and leave it dead,'' according
to the indictments.
   FBI officials said they did not know the name of the saint. They
also did not say how the meeting was taped.
   Thomas Hughes, special agent in charge of the investigation,
said Patriarca family members could face grave consequences for
their slip that fall day, when the FBI apparently was two steps
ahead and armed with a bug.
   ``Patriarca and others should be in mortal fear over the
embarrassment of having such a ceremony recorded,'' he said.
   Witness previously have testified about Mafia induction
ceremonies, but officials said the account revealed in Monday's
indictments for the first time promised prosecutors solid evidence
of such activity.
   ``It's consistent with everything we've ever said about what
these ceremonies entail,'' said O'Callaghan. ``Now we finally have
the evidence and I don't think the value of that can be
underestimated.''

   More schools are offering sex education to
combat AIDS and teen pregnancy, but they often sidestep sensitive
issues of sexual relationships and roles, a research group said
Tuesday.
   ``All too few programs address the important questions for young
people of affection, dating responsibility in relationships,
communication and decision-making skills, and similar issues which
dominate their thinking and feelings,'' said Robert Selverstone,
president of the Sex Information and Education Council of the U.S.
which produced the report.
   ``Why is it that acquaintance rape has replaced robbery as the
most serious campus crime? Why is it that there is so much discord
in relationships?'' said Selverstone at a news conference
introducing the report, ``Sex Education 2000: A Call to Action.''
   The 36-page report noted that 23 states now mandate sex
education and 23 more encourage the teaching of sex education,
compared with only three requiring it in 1980.
   But such instruction is usually preoccupied with ``disaster
prevention,'' the report said, and tends to deal only with the
negative aspects of human sexuality.
   Little or no sex education takes place in the early grades,
according to the report. The average amount of classroom time spent
on sexuality is 11.7 hours in grade 7, and 18 hours in grade 12.
   The report, written by SIECUS executive director Debra W.
Haffner, cautioned that sex education by itself should not be
expected to solve the AIDS crisis, teen pregnancy or other negative
consequences of sexual behavior.
   Instead, the report called on all segments of the community,
including parents, schools, religious institutions, youth
organizations, health professionals and the media, to recognize
their roles in providing guidance to youngsters.
   States should assure that by the year 2000 ``all children will
receive comprehensive sexuality education from preschool through
adulthood,'' the report said.
   The report said the 50 states are spending just $648,500 on sex
education and $5.1 million on AIDS education. And federal support
has dried up altogether during the past decade, according to the
report.
   Such spending levels `` clearly reflect the minimal importance
this area receives as a public policy priority,'' the report said.
It called for more funds for teacher training and curricular
materials.
   While 74 percent of state-mandated curricula discuss condoms,
only 9 percent teach children how to use or obtain them, the report
said.
   SIECUS is a private, non-profit research organization founded 25
years ago to promote sexual health and education.
   The recommendations in the SIECUS report echo positions by the
American Association of School Administrators and other major
education groups, health groups and teacher organizations
supporting sex education.
   Last summer, for example, the National Education Association,
the nation's largest teacher union, passed a resolution urging its
affiliates and members to support appropriately established sex
education programs.
   Far from increasing the curricular burdens of public schools,
the SIECUS proposals ``would tend to lighten the load,'' said NEA
spokesman Howard Carroll. If youngsters really were taught about
the full range of sexual issues, they'd be less likely to fall prey
to the crises that wind up burdening school officials, he said.

   One played soccer. One sewed clothes. One never
saw the infant son he left behind in Honduras. The Happy Land
Social Club fire was not a single catastrophe but 87 _ one for each
victim.
   The stories unfold, one after another, as families of the
victims arrange funerals here and in Central America. At a
makeshift clearinghouse at a school near the burned-out club, they
seek help from government and relief organizations even as they
mourn.
   Herman Gamoneda remembered his cousins, 23-year-old Marco
Gamoneda and 18-year-old Leni, as brothers who were also
inseparable friends.
   ``They did everything together. They were always together. They
worked together, they were going to school together. A couple of
nice guys,'' he said.
   Their brother, Jose, showed four photographs of Marco and Leni
in their soccer uniforms _ they played together on the Falcons club
in the Bronx _ and relaxing at home. In one, Marco clowned with
another teammate.
   They had arrived in the United States from Honduras two years
ago and both attended at Bronx Community College. Herman Gamoneda
said they had never gone out together at night _ until Saturday.
   Their bodies will return, together, to Honduras for burial.
   So will the body of Naomi Luque DeGarcia, 43. She had been a
school teacher in Honduras for 21 years and had taken a six-month
leave. She had come to New York two months ago to visit a cousin;
her husband and four children, ranging from age 2{ to 17, were
grieving back in Puerta Tela.
   There were so many others.
   Minerva Ramos Duprey, 51, was a bartender at the club who worked
days as a seamstress. ``She was full of life,'' said a niece,
Alicia Bocachica. Nicholas Zapata Guadron, 22, was a construction
worker who dreamed of buying a house and running a little store in
Honduras.
   Lester Orlando Cruz, in his early 20s, had come to New York 14
months ago, leaving behind his pregnant wife in Potrerillo Cortes,
Honduras. She subsequently gave birth, but ``he never saw his baby
son. Only in pictures. He wanted to send for his wife and kid,''
said Carmen Rodriguez, a friend.
   Juan Carlos Colon had been in New York since 1983. He was 18, a
senior at a Manhattan high school, a good soccer player.
   He wanted to be a video producer, and he used the video art to
fight drug abuse. He was ``a good, gentle boy. You'd often hear him
warning young people to stay away from drugs,'' said his
stepmother, Miriam Colon.
   He was at Happy Land that Saturday night with his girlfriend,
Alba Romero Escoto. She, too, perished; she, too, was an
18-year-old immigrant from Honduras, a high-school senior who
worked weekends as a home attendant.
   There was Israel Laurino, a Vietnam veteran who rarely went out;
Francisco Romero, 33, a janitor who left behind six kids and a
pregnant wife; Elias Colon, owner of the club, a 20-year veteran of
the Merchant Marine.
   Each left behind a legion of mourners. Lester McNab, 24, stood
across the street from the social club on Tuesday and stared _ he
lost a dozen friends in the fire, and had planned to be there that
night.
   ``I don't know how it could happen. I can't explain it. It's not
rational. I'm just here standing in shock,'' he said.
   A young woman shouted out that her cousin was among the dead.
``I was here at 12:30 ( the night of the fire). I left here at
12:30. When I woke up, my mother told me she was gone,'' she said.
   Screaming and crying, she collapsed steps away from where her
cousin died.

<TEXT>
   Chicago and several New Jersey cities have begun cracking down
on illegal social clubs like New York's Happy Land, the firetrap
where 87 people died in a gasoline-fed blaze.
   Officials in many cities around the nation say they don't have
such clubs, which typically operate without licenses and stay open
after hours. But in those cities that do, Sunday's fire sent a
cautionary message.
   In New York, Mayor David Dinkins said Monday he was conferring
with the City Council speaker about legislation to regulate the
clubs, including stiffer penalties for violations.
   Dinkins acknowledged that social clubs are useful as ethnic
meeting places, but he had a message for patrons: ``I would tell
them to tell the management they're not going to frequent them
again until they make them safe again.''
   In Chicago, Building Commissioner Daniel Weil said city
officials are inspecting at least 100 registered non-profit social
clubs, and will be trying to locate any unlicensed clubs in hopes
of preventing a tragedy like the Happy Land fire.
   ``When a tragedy like this occurs, you don't want to ignore
it,'' Weil said.
   There was similar concern in several New Jersey cities.
   In Elizabeth, Mayor Thomas G. Dunn said city inspectors would
put at least seven illegal nightclubs out of business as a result
of the Happy Land fire. Two owners of one club were arrested Monday
and about 100 patrons chased from the place, he said.
   In Paterson, vice squad Sgt. Michael Recca said three or four
such establishments have been shut down in the last month.
   ``Generally the violations involve illegal alcoholic beverage
sales and with that we find a high incidence of drug sales between
patrons,'' he said.
   In Camden, Cyrus Saxon, the city's alcoholic beverage control
investigator, is seeking inspections of unlicensed social clubs in
the city. Saxon said most of the night-spots do not have liquor
licenses, but serve alcohol and cater to a dancing crowd.
   ``The problem is you don't really know,'' said Saxon. ``You
don't know if these places have enough exits or fire escapes.''

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's leaders sent a protest
letter Tuesday to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to denounce
Moscow's treatment of the breakaway republic.
   Here is the text, made available to The Associated Press and
translated by the Lithuanian parliament's information service:
   
   U.S.S.R., Moscow
   The Kremlin
   To Mr. Gorbachev
   President of the U.S.S.R.
   To the Government of the U.S.S.R.
   
   The Supreme Council and the Government of the Republic of
Lithuania express a strong protest against the actions of the
U.S.S.R. Armed Forces on the territory of the Republic of
Lithuania, grossly violating the sovereignty of the Republic. The
constant demonstration of armed force, blackmail by means of armed
interference, unlawful occupation of civil buildings by military
personnel, and especially the kidnapping of Lithuanian citizens on
the night of March 26-27, 1990, who were under the protection of
the Government and the Red Cross, resulting in bloodshed, all of
which are clear indications that Lithuania remains a country on
whose territory an occupying power can commit acts of violence and
remain unpunished. This is an inexcusable aggression and a
continuation of the aggression against the people of Lithuania that
began in 1940.
   In response to the aforementioned facts, the Government of
Lithuania demands the return of its kidnapped citizens; recalls its
delegates, former U.S.S.R. People's Deputies, from Moscow; and
demands that negotiations with the government of the U.S.S.R. be
held in neutral territory.
   Lithuania is an unarmed, peaceful state and the only way it can
resist the aggressor is by moral strength and by not using armed
resistance to violence.
   President of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania,
V. Landsbergis
   Prime Minister of the Republic of Lithuania, K. Prunskiene.

<HEAD>Bush To See Mulroney and Baseball Game in Toronto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will journey to Toronto on
April 10 for a fast round of talks and a few innings of
baseball-watching with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the
White House said Tuesday.
   The two leaders, after an afternoon chat, will take in some of
the Toronto Blue Jays' home opener that night against the Texas
Rangers in the Toronto SkyDome. The president's eldest son, George
Walker Bush, 43, is a part-owner of the Rangers.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and Mulroney
will ``discuss bilateral and international issues of mutual
interest, particularly the changes taking place in Europe.''
   But he acknowledged the lightning visit _ Bush plans to arrive
in mid-afternoon, stay for only a few innings of the game and
return to the White House before midnight _ was ``mostly baseball.''
   Bush had planned to attend the baseball opener in Cincinnati
next week, but the season was delayed a week because of the
contract dispute in which owners locked players out of spring
training for 32 days. The two sides finally settled March 19.
   Bush told reporters last Wednesday he was still eager to throw
out a ceremonial first ball somewhere.
   ``I want to do what's right by the national pastime. I don't
want to do it if people think it's frivolous,'' the president said.
   Bush threw out the first ball last April in Baltimore, where he
had Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in tow as his guest. Mubarak
seemed baffled by the game.
   The joint Bush-Mulroney outing to the SkyDome _ the showcase
park with a retractable dome and a Hard Rock Cafe on the premises _
creates some sticky questions of protocol:
   Who gets to throw out the first ball?
   Or, if they both make a pitch, who throws the real one?
   Fitzwater dodged the question, saying, ``I don't have any
information.''
   At the Blue Jays' camp in Dunedin, Fla., Howard Starkman, the
director of public relations, called it ``a very good question. I
don't have an answer for you. I think the protocol would have to be
determined by the prime minister's office.''
   Mulroney, by all accounts far more knowledgeable about baseball
than Mubarak, threw out the first ball during the Blue Jays'
championship series last fall with the Oakland Athletics. The A's
won in a rout.
   But Starkman said Mulroney is ``not as great a fan as Bush,''
captain of the baseball team at Yale. Bush still keeps his first
baseman's mitt close by.
   The Rangers and Blue Jays will start the season on April 9 in
Texas.

<HEAD>Brazilian President Withdraws Disputed Law Jailing Economic
Offenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a decision seen as a setback to his
economic reform plan, President Fernando Collor de Mello on Tuesday
withdrew two controversial laws related to the plan that jailed
offenders without bail.
   But Collor warned that more changes to his plan, unveiled March
16, would destroy Brazil's chances to curtail 2,700 percent
inflation.
   Provisional Measures 153 and 156 were invoked by police last
week to arrest and hold without bail some 30 bankers and
businessmen. The measures prohibited selling goods and services
above the government-set rate and outlawed tax cheating.
   Congressmen and legal experts say the measures were
unconstitutional.
   The provisional measures were invoked immediately but required
congressional approval within 30 days. Approval seemed unlikely.
   Collor said he would scrap the measures and resubmit them as a
bill to Congress.
   ``We are not retreating,'' Collor said. ``We want to march in
step with the constitution.''
   Public opinion polls show Brazilians overwhelmingly support the
overall plan, which includes an 18-month freeze on $115 billion in
savings accounts and financial market deposits.
   One survey showed 94 percent favored the two-to-five year prison
sentences for tax cheating and illegal price hikes.
   However, several legislators called the decrees dictatorial.
After police invaded the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo to
investigate charges of illegal billing, the paper called Collor a
``fledgling dictator'' and compared him to Benito Mussolini.
   Collor also announced that Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de
Mello would travel abroad next week for talks with creditors of
Brazil's $114 billion foreign debt, the largest in the Third World.
   Brazil will seek a broad renegotiation of terms, he said. The
country now pays about $12 billion a year in interest alone,
although payments have been suspended since September.
   Last week, the Economy Ministry said debt payments would be
limited to $5 billion a year.
   Collor said Brazil must guarantee its growth before it can repay
its debt. He said the government would avoid ``confrontation'' with
creditors and predicted talks would be favorable because of ``the
credibility recovered by the country.''

<HEAD>Avianca Pilot Asked for Fuel Emergency, But Co-Pilot Used Other
Words</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The co-pilot of the Avianca airliner that
crashed in New York told the pilot he had radioed a fuel emergency
but he used less precise language with ground controllers, a
transcript of cockpit talk showed Tuesday.
   The plane, which apparently ran out of fuel, crashed Jan. 25 at
Cove Neck, Long Island, killing 73 of the 159 people aboard,
including all three cockpit crew members.
   ``Tell them we are in emergency,'' said the Colombian pilot in
Spanish just after the plane failed its first landing attempt and
10 minutes before it crashed.
   ``We're running out of fuel,'' the co-pilot told controllers in
English at 9:24 p.m., after the crew of the Boeing 707 was
instructed to abort the attempted landing at John F. Kennedy
airport and loop around for another try.
   A few seconds later, the pilot again asked the co-pilot to tell
the controller there was an emergency. ``Digale que estamos en
emergencia,'' the pilot said, also asking whether his order had
been carried out.
   ``Si, Senor, ya le dije,'' said the co-pilot _ ``Yes, sir, I
already advised him,'' according to the transcript and translation
released by the National Transportation Safety Board.
   None of the cockpit crew members was identified by name in the
transcript. The flight had come from Bogota and Medellin.
   A source close to the investigation had told The Associated
Press in New York on Monday that the transcript appeared to show a
pilot who did not seem to be in full charge of the flight and who
did not give specific direction to the co-pilot to declare an
emergency.
   The 68-page transcript of the flight's final 40 minutes,
however, contained two instances in which the pilot used the
critical word ``emergency'' in communicating with his co-pilot.
   After the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all
airlines flying to U.S. airports to ensure that their crews use
specifically worded language in communicating emergencies to
controllers. If a ``fuel emergency'' had been declared, the plane
would have been given a higher priority in landing, officials said.
   Board investigators who released the transcript declined to
evaluate crew performance. Cause of the crash will be determined by
the four-member safety board after the investigation is completed
in about 10 months.
   As air traffic controllers were giving the plane instructions
for a second approach to the airport, the co-pilot radioed: ``We'll
try once again. We're running out of fuel.''
   A few seconds later, the pilot said, ``I don't know what
happened with the runway. I didn't see it.''
   Both co-pilots repeated the same thing: ``I didn't see it.''
   After one instruction from the pilot to advise the controller
that ``we don't have fuel,'' the co-pilot said into the radio,
``Climb and maintain 3,000 and, ah, we're running out of fuel,
sir.''
   The final eight minutes on the tape contained only one further
reference to fuel, when the New York controller told the plane he
was going to bring it about 15 miles northeast and then turn it
back for the final approach.
   ``Is that fine with you and your fuel?'' the controller asked.
   ``I guess so. Thank you very much,'' the co-pilot radioed.
   In the cockpit, the pilot asked, ``What did he say?''
   The third man in the cockpit replied, ``The guy is angry.'' The
transcript does not make it clear whom he is referring to or why he
made the statement.
   There is also a point about seven minutes before the crash where
the pilot says, ``A morir,'' or ``to die.'' But its meaning is not
clear from the transcript and there is no other statement to
indicate it was a reference to the imminent crash.
   The final minutes of the tape before the crash were undramatic,
full of routine flight instructions, except when the third officer
in the cockpit announced that the No. 4 engine had died, followed a
minute later by the No. 3 engine, leaving only two in operation.
   ``Flameout on engine No. 3, essential on No. 2, on No. 1,'' the
third crew member said.
   The final words in the transcript refer to the instrument
landing system. The tape apparently stopped recording as power
failed several seconds before impact at 9:34 p.m.
   Preliminary results of drug tests on the bodies of the pilots
indicated no use of illegal substances, a board source said.

Academy Award-winning actress Glenda Jackson to run for a seat in
Parliament in Britain's next general election.
   Miss Jackson, winner of best actress Oscars for the 1970 film
``Women in Love'' and 1973's ``A Touch of Class,'' said she would
give up acting if elected to the north London constituency now held
by the governing Conservatives of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   ``You can't be a part-time MP (member of Parliament) and you
certainly can't be a part-time actor,'' said Miss Jackson, 53,
after she was chosen by local members of the socialist Labor Party
in Hampstead and Highgate, the north London constituency.
   ``It is one of the proudest and one of the most humbling moments
of my life,'' Miss Jackson said following a poll of 800 members of
the constituency's Labor Party in which she won 59.16 percent of
the vote. She pledged to work hard to win the seat, which the
Conservatives hold by a 2,221-vote majority.
   The general election must be held before mid-1992 but can be
called at any time by the government, which is trailing in some
national polls by more than 20 percent, primarily because of a
controversial new tax.
   Miss Jackson is considered one of Britain's foremost stage
actresses and has also had a successful film career.

   Brazil's two stock markets
continued to plunge Monday in the aftermath of draconian economic
reforms decreed by new President Fernando Collor de Mello.
   In Rio, the stock market was off by a record 16.2 percent, and
has now fallen by one-third since Collor announced his package Mar.
16.
   The much-larger Sao Paulo exchange dropped by 6 percent Monday
after plunging 49 percent last week.
   Stock market analysts say the fall on the two exchanges is
largely due to a lack of money in circulation.
   Collor's economic package, designed to cut record inflation of
73 percent in February, included an 18-month freeze on assets of
more than $1,200 in private bank savings accounts and $600 on
short-term money market deposits. The measure took about $115
billion out of circulation _ 80 percent of all bank deposits.
   Stock investors, desperate to get their hands on cash, are
selling off shares even at low prices, analysts say.
   The money squeeze has also created a steep drop in business
sales and large scale layoffs in some industries, with many
economists saying Brazil, Latin America's most populous with 150
million residents, could soon be mired in a deep recession.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Seeks Seabrook License Delay</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Massachusetts pushed on two fronts Tuesday
to halt the start-up of New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear power
plant before summer crowds flock to nearby beaches.
   State attorneys argued before a Nuclear Regulatory Commission
appeal board for a temporary shutdown of the plant. At the same
time, the lawyers and other Seabrook opponents pushed to have
federal appeals court judges move up the date of a hearing on the
case from September to this spring.
   ``We're trying to get a hearing before summer,'' said John
Traficonte, who is handling the case for Massachusetts Attorney
General James Shannon. ``That is the time of year when thousands of
people will be sitting on the beaches.''
   In Tuesday's hearing before the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Appeal Board, Traficonte argued that an error made by plant
operators during low-power testing in June warranted a second look
and that the plant's operating license should be suspended in the
meantime.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher called the latest legal manuvers by
Massachusetts ``just another effort to delay the operation of
Seabrook Station for no good reason.''
   ``The fact is Seabrook is a safe plant,'' Sher said.
   Massachusetts and other opponents have argued for years that
Seabrook was too close to densely populated coastal areas to allow
for safe evacuation in a nuclear emergency. The NRC rejected those
arguments March 1 and awarded Seabrook an operating license.
   The plant already has begun to move toward full power, a process
that will take about three months.
   Traficonte said one of the most dangerous times in the operation
of any nuclear plant is the first acceleration to full power. Under
the current schedule, Seabrook will be in its first weeks of
full-power operation during the summer, when tens of thousands of
beach-goers flock to nearby resort towns.
   On June 22, Seabrook operators conducting low-power testing
didn't shut down the plant after a valve failure when guidelines
indicated it should have been shut down. The NRC ordered a halt to
testing and fined Seabrook $50,000.
   Traficonte said the NRC made its licensing decision in March
without resolving the problems that led to the June incident.
   Sher rejected those arguments.
   ``The power ascension program is a very safe, conservative
program,'' Sher said. ``More than 100 plants have gone through the
power ascension program safely in the United States.''
   Sher said that the problems that led to the June incident have
been corrected.
   The appeal board said it wanted more information from Shannon's
office and the Seabrook operators and gave both parties up to 17
days to comply.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Israel Stalling to Gain Time Against Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat said Tuesday
that Israel's political leaders were stalling over formation of a
new government in an effort to gain time against the Palestinian
uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``I expected this,'' the Palestine Liberation Organization
chairman told a news conference. ``From the very beginning they are
trying to win time.''
   Referring to Israel's internal political turmoil following a
no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
efforts by the more moderate Shimon Peres to form a new government,
Arafat said: ``To resign or not to resign, to go to elections or
not to go to elections: This will continue, and in the end we will
raise our flag'' _ the flag of Palestine on territory now held by
Israel.
   Arafat said after the news conference he thought Peres, who has
indicated a willingness to begin some sort of dialogue on the
Palestinian question, would win the Israeli power struggle.
   ``I think he will have a slight majority,'' he said. Asked if a
Peres victory would make it easier to start talks on the occupied
territories, Arafat gave a slight nod. ``But I don't want to say
anything now,'' he said.
   During the half-hour news conference, Arafat criticized U.S.
senators who last week adopted a resolution that said, ``Jerusalem
is and should remain the capital of the state of Israel.''
   ``This is one resolution, like other resolutions, that the
Congress has been adopting without really studying as they
should,'' he said.
   ``This is not a challenge for me only. This is a challenge for
(President) Bush, also, who said Israel should not have the right
to settle new Jews in East Jerusalem as East Jerusalem is occupied
territory,'' Arafat said.
   The Senate resolution contradicted U.S. policy, which says the
sovereignty of Jerusalem should be determined in Arab-Israeli
negotiations. Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the
1967 Mideast war and declared the entire holy city its capital. The
United States, like most nations, maintains its embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Arafat said the United States was partly to blame for the flood
of Soviet Jews to Israel and the possibility of them settling in
the West Bank.
   ``The doors for immigration have been closed for these
immigrants in America and in other countries,'' he said.
   Referring to the Moslem uprising against Indian rule in Kashmir,
which is claimed by both predominantly Hindu India and Islamic
Pakistan, Arafat said the two countries were ``friendly neighbors''
who should find a peaceful solution.
   He said there was no comparison between Kashmir and Palestine.
Palestine, he said, was a question of democracy, not religion.
   Arafat, flanked by a PLO interpreter and an Indian Foreign
Ministry official, spoke from a podium in front of a namecard that
identified him as ``the president of the state of Palestine.''
India was one of the first non-Arab nations to recognize the PLO's
declaration of Palestinian statehood in 1988. The Palestinian
uprising began in December 1987.
   The PLO chief came to India to receive the Jawaharlal Nehru
award for peace and international understanding. The award is named
for India's first prime minister.
   During his visit, Arafat met Prime Minister V.P. Singh, whose
National Front coalition government took office last December, and
with the opposition Congress Party leader, former Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
   On Wednesday, Arafat is to fly to Calcutta to meet Mother
Teresa, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. In 1982, at the
height of the Israeli siege of West Beirut where Arafat and his
guerrillas were trapped, the frail Roman Catholic nun braved the
war to rescue mentally retarded children from a hospital near the
front lines.

   The White House abruptly muted its criticism
of Soviet actions against Lithuania on Tuesday but still reminded
Moscow that a severe crackdown could damage superpower relations.
   ``We do not want to inflame the situation,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, declining to criticize the
Kremlin for seizing at least 23 army deserters from two hospitals
in Lithuania in a bloody show of force.
   ``We simply don't feel that inflammatory language is helpful,''
Fitzwater said.
   While toning down its public rhetoric, the administration was
privately warning Moscow against taking a tough stand, officials
said.
   ``We are letting them know that if they really crack down, we
will react, and not just the administration. Congress could takes
steps and we might not be able to control the reaction,'' said one
administration source.
   Two sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said possible
U.S. responses might be to postpone a superpower summit scheduled
for June or to delay treaties on nuclear, chemical and conventional
arms that both sides want to sign this year.
   However, one source said, ``We don't want to do something that
would punish us as much as the Russians.'' A likely first step
would be suspension of trade talks designed to give Moscow most
favored nation status in commerce with the United States.
   Asked if Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had violated his
pledge against using force in Lithuania, Fitzwater replied, ``We
simply are not going to try to give definition to words like
`force' and `intimidation.'''
   The restrained U.S. reaction was a sudden change in tone after
repeated expressions of concern by President Bush and others about
escalating pressure against Lithuania, which defied Moscow and
declared its independence March 11.
   With the planned summit and prospect of arms agreements, both
Bush and Gorbachev have a huge stake in keeping U.S.-Soviet
relations on an even keel.
   Appealing for U.S. understanding, a Soviet diplomat in
Washington defended the seizure of deserters, saying every army has
a right to maintain discipline and contending Moscow was not using
force against Lithuania.
   ``Even Vice President (Dan) Quayle admitted the other day there
should be some discipline in the army,'' said Sergei Chetverikov,
minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy.
   On Saturday, Quayle said the Soviets should not threaten the
Lithuanians but that there was a ``certain amount of discipline
that is absolutely imperative in any armed force.''
   Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said Tuesday that the
vice president ``in no way countenanced the violent rounding up of
deserters.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter discussed Lithuania with Bush
during an Oval Office meeting concerning Carter's recent trip to
the Middle East.
   Speaking with reporters later in the White House driveway,
Carter said, ``President Gorbachev faces a quandary: Is he going to
let part of the Soviet Union break off, on the one hand; at the
same time, how to treat with compassion and understanding the move
that he, himself, has precipitated toward democracy, toward freedom
and toward an expression of independence.''
   He said the United States ``has played it very well'' by urging
a peaceful settlement.
   Asked if there were a danger that U.S.-Soviet progress could be
undone by tensions over Lithuania, Carter said, ``There's always a
danger but I don't want to comment on it.''
   At a rally on the Capitol steps, organized by the newly formed
Americans for Lithuanian Independence, a crowd of several hundred
sang Lithuanian and American patriotic songs and heard a parade of
congressmen appeal for swift recognition of Lithuania.
   ``We stood by as the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square and did
very little,'' said Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, a senior
Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``Let's not
stand by and let there be bloodletting in Lithuania.''
   Fitzwater, referring to the tense standoff in Lithuania, said,
``This is a very complex, delicate diplomatic situation and we will
continue to treat it as such.''
   The United States has never recognized the forced incorporation
of Lithuania into the Soviet Union, along with the Baltic states of
Estonia and Latvia, in 1940.
   Despite Lithuania's declaration of independence, the United
States has refused to grant it formal diplomatic recognition,
saying the Lithuanians do not control their territory and calling
on the Soviet Union and Lithuania to negotiate their differences.
   Fitzwater said any outcome in Lithuania other than a peaceful
one ``runs a risk of being counterproductive for the Soviet Union
itself, for U.S.-Soviet relations and will have adverse
international repercussions.''
   The spokesman said, ``We have made it clear from the beginning
that the relationship is one of the factors that is at stake and
that this is a very serious issue that we are watching.''
   As recently as Monday, the administration criticized Moscow for
occupying Communist Party buildings in the capital of Vilnius.
Fitzwater said then that Soviet efforts to intimidate Lithuanians
``seemed to have escalated on a daily basis.''
   On Tuesday, he declined to say that the seizing of Lithuanian
deserters marked a further escalation. ``I choose not to do it
today,'' Fitzwater said, adding that ``we are worried that our
comments might be portrayed in such a way as they would be
unhelpful.''
   He said, ``We were a little concerned at the way some of my
words yesterday were played (in the media) with regard to that
episode. I want to be more careful today.''
   While refusing to criticize the seizure of deserters, Fitzwater
said, ``We view with deep concern the developments of last week and
yesterday.''
   He said his comment ``extends to all events but we are reluctant
to pick out one or the other to comment on.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Negotiations Have Had Little Impact on World Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Decades of multinational negotiations have had
little impact on world trade in farm commodities, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday.
   ``There's no question in my mind that agriculture is the most
distortive sector of the world economy, when one evaluates existing
trade patterns,'' Yeutter told a meeting of the Food Executives
International Congress.
   In the case of industrial goods, there has been substantial
progress in trade liberalization under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. There has been a move under GATT to deal with
the international aspects of the financial and service sectors.
   ``Agriculture has been on the agenda for the past 40 years, and
probably nothing has happened,'' Yeutter said. ``We've gone through
40 years of GATT history, through a whole series of multilateral
trade rounds, and for all practical purposes we, the members of
GATT, have accomplished nothing in the way of agricultural trade
liberalization.''
   The current Uruguay Round of GATT talks is scheduled to conclude
at the end of this year.
   Yeutter said there are all sorts of ``schemes'' used to avoid
trade liberalization and that agricultural commodities are favorite
targets.
   ``If it exists, it's applied to agriculture,'' he said. ``If
there's anything that is distortive, you can bet your bottom dollar
it's used by some country somewhere to impede agricultural trade.''
   Those devices, he said, include export subsidies, high internal
price supports, quotas and licensing.
   Yeutter pointedly used Japan's restrictive import policy on rice
as an example.
   Recently, he said, a U.S. rice industry group participated in a
food show in Japan and included samples of American rice. But the
Japanese government asked that the samples be withdrawn.
   ``I wonder about anyone's commitment to trade liberalization
when we can't even show a sample of an American food product in
Japan,'' Yeutter said.
   The European Economic Community, for years a favorite target of
U.S. trade officials, also was cited by Yeutter for boosting
internal soybean price supports to more than $18 a bushel. The U.S.
price support was $4.53 for 1989 soybeans.
   ``I told some of them here recently that if you paid me $18 a
bushel for soybeans, I'd grow them on the Alps, and I think maybe
somebody's going to grow them on the Alps if that continues very
much longer,'' he said.
   ``If you pay farmers enough money, they'll grow anything
anywhere.''

<TEXT>
   The National Science Foundation on Tuesday
announced up to $10 million will be provided to selected states
with detailed plans to stimulate major improvements in math and
science education.
   Foundation Director Erich Bloch said the new science education
improvement effort supports the goal of President Bush and the
nation's governors to make American students first in the world in
science and mathematics achievement by the year 2000.
   ``To prosper in this world the United States must maintain a
strong base in science and engineering, because that is the basis
for much of our economic strength,'' said Bloch, who stressed the
need for systemic changes in state education programs.
   Bloch said that the foundation expects in the first year to
select four to eight states, on a competitive basis, to participate
in the program.
   ``We will look for comprehensive plans to improve statewide
science and mathematics education significantly _ not simply to
tinker with the details,'' he said. ``Plans will need to deal with
teacher preparation, retention, and continuing education; with
curriculum improvements, with student motivation, and with
upgrading educational facilities.''
   Bloch said the plans also must include governors, state
legislative leaders, chief state school officers, teacher's
organizations, school administrators, unions and parent groups,
industry leaders and presidents of colleges and universities.
   Noting the numerous studies documenting the poor achievements of
U.S. students in math and science, Bloch said, ``we want to move
beyond studies, and beyond planning in the abstract, to real
action.''
   For the selected states, the foundation will make grants
totaling $5 million to $10 million over the expected life of the
project. Bloch said that ``significant systemic changes'' must be
supported through ``long-term fiscal commitments from state
legislatures and other sources, public and private, to assure
permanence of the reforms begun in the program.''
   Bloch said states must submit preliminary proposals for the
Statewide Initiatives Program by July 9, with the deadline for
formal proposals set for Oct. 15.

<HEAD>Carter Says International Peace Conference Necessary for Middle
East</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Jimmy Carter, just back from
a private peace-seeking mission to the Middle East, said Tuesday
there will be no end to unrest there without an international peace
conference for the region.
   Carter, who briefed President Bush for 35 minutes on his trip,
said he was encouraged about the prospects for peace.
   ``I think that there's a general acceptance now that a
comprehensive peace is not only necessary but I think inevitable,''
he said.
   Nonetheless, Carter said it was distressing that the Middle East
is still in turmoil 11 years after he helped negotiate the Camp
David accords between Israel and Egypt.
   Carter refused to predict when any kind of negotiations might
begin in the Middle East, in part because Israel still doesn't have
a government. The United States has long opposed such a
broad-ranging, many-nations conference, prefering direct
negotiations among the states involved.
   The Israeli coalition government recently fell, not long after
Bush stirred controversy by criticizing the settlement of Soviet
Jews in East Jerusalem.
   The United States has been pressing Israel to open talks with
the Palestinians of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has been trying to put together a
Palestinian delegation, Carter noted.
   ``I think our government ought to use its maximum influence _
not pressure _ in Israel and the other countries as well to go to
the bargaining table to find peace,'' he said.
   There will be ``no end'' to the intifada _ the term used for the
Palestinian uprising against Israel _ until ``there is an
international peace conference,'' Carter said in remarks at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank he
visited after his trip to the White House.
   Moreover, Carter said he believes the intifada was caused by the
way the Israelis have treated Palestinians.
   The former president said he brought up human rights repeatedly
in Israel, complaining about practices such as detaining
Palestinians for 12 months without allowing access to a lawyer.
   Israelis of all parties have said prospects for talks with
Palestinians were threatened by Bush's statement that the United
States did not want to see additional Jewish settlements
established in the occupied territories, including East Jerusalem.
Past U.S. statements on the subjects have not specifically
mentioned East Jerusalem, which Israel has annexed.
   Carter defended Bush's statements. ``I think what President Bush
has expressed is a policy that's been our government's ... for the
last 23 years.''
   The U.S. government has for years insisted that the final status
of East Jerusalem could be determined only by negotiations.
   Carter visited Israel, Egypt, Syria and Jordan on his latest
trip.
   Carter played a leading role in monitoring last month's
elections in Nicaragua, in which Sandinista President Daniel Ortega
lost to Violeta de Chamorro. He has also tried to mediate a truce
between factions in Ethiopia and the Sudan.
   The meeting between Bush and Carter was the first time the two
had talked since the Nicaraguan elections. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III also attended the meeting with Bush and Carter.
   At the White House, Carter told reporters Bush has reacted well
to the situation in Lithuania where leaders want to break from the
Soviet Union.
   ``I think our government has played it very well so far by
imploring all parties not to resort to force or violence and to
resolve this in a peaceful fashion,'' said the former president.

<HEAD>Revenge Arsonist Profile: Poor, Powerless, Rejected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor, powerless, alone and rejected, Julio
Gonzalez fits the profile of a revenge arsonist, an expert said
Tuesday. Most chilling, he said, is that such killers rarely
consider the lives they destroy.
   ``They're angry against society. They feel a need to strike
out,'' said John Barracato, a fire investigator and author of a
book on arson. ``They only want to vent their frustration. They
don't care about the other people.''
   Gonzalez, 36, is charged with setting the fire that killed 87
patrons of an unlicensed social club in the Bronx early Sunday.
Police charge he was angry with his ex-girlfriend, who worked there.
   Prosecutors say he has admitted setting the fire in revenge.
   While details are lacking, accounts portray Gonzalez as a quiet
man who lived lawfully but in poverty since his arrival from Cuba a
decade ago. Neighbors said nothing foretold the slaughter of which
he is accused.
   But two blows recently shook his life: Six weeks ago he was
dismissed from the Queens lamp factory where he worked, and at
about the same time he broke up with Lydia Feliciano, with whom he
had lived for seven or eight years.
   Gonzalez allegedly argued with Ms. Feliciano early Sunday at the
Happy Land Social Club, where she was a coat checker. A bouncer
ejected him and, prosecutors said, he left threatening to shut the
place down.
   Police say he bought $1 worth of gasoline, splashed it into the
club's doorway and ignited it. Authorities said his shoes reeked of
gasoline when police arrested him 12 hours later, sleeping in his
10-by-10 foot, $80-a-week furnished room.
   While Barracato could not comment directly about the case, he
said arson for revenge _ which accounts for about half of all arson
cases _ commonly is started with an accelerant such as gasoline and
is intended as revenge against a perceived offense.
   ``When someone gets locked into an anger stage of emotion he
wants total destruction,'' said Barracato, a former deputy chief
city fire marshal and now director of the fire and fraud section of
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co.
   While emotion incites the crime, ``There's no loss of control,''
said Barracato, who conducted a six-year study of arsonists. ``It's
calculated and it's planned. ... They want to assert themselves.
They want power, and what can be more powerful than intentionally
setting a fire.''
   The greatest question about Gonzalez's past is his life in Cuba,
which he left in the Mariel boatlift that brought 125,000 people to
the United States in 1980. He told authorities he was born in
Holguin, in Oriente province, and worked as a mechanic and
construction assistant. He said his nickname was ``Pochocho,'' a
diminutive with no meaning.
   Gonzalez told U.S. immigration officials he had been jailed for
three years in Cuba for an unapproved absence from the Army, and
that he had falsely confessed to drug trafficking so Cuban
authorities would let him join the boatlift.
   After his arrival, he was detained in U.S. camps for nine
months, then released.
   U.S. officials have complained that Cuba used the boatlift to
cast off criminals and people with mental problems. Cuban officials
in Washington did not return telephone calls Tuesday seeking
information on Gonzalez.
   Barracato said many arsonists have no criminal history, but they
often share other attributes: Poverty, low education, broken homes,
a lack of idols, personal isolation, extreme introversion, low
self-esteem.
   The underclass status faced by many poor immigrants can
contribute to the alienation arsonists seem to share, Barracato
said. The result: Resentment, and, if pushed to the brink, an urge
for revenge.
   ``They don't think that by that act they'll kill people,'' he
said. ``It's, `I'll get even with them.'''
   Typically when it comes to revenge, said Barracato, ``he could
care less'' about victims.

   She has a steady job and a place to live, but
Shelley Woods says she'll feel at ease when she stands up with
homeless writers and poets at the Chicago Public Library to read
her verse about her life on the streets.
   ``A lot of people don't like to tell about the dark side of
their lives, but I hope this will help people who are down and
out,'' the 37-year-old poet, who is also office manager for the
Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, said Tuesday.
   In 1972, Ms. Woods lived out of a car for a year with her two
yonother apartment.
   Ms. Woods said she lost her subsidized apartment in January 1980
after the rent increased and her welfare benefits declined because
of her job.
   ``It was so cold outside with two small children,'' Ms. Woods
said. ``It was hard, but I didn't give up.''
   A friend helped her out, and Ms. Woods learned secretarial
skills. She was hired by the coalition, where she's worked for the
past five years.
   The poet said she wants to send a message to those who've been
more fortunate.
   ``People have this stereotype of the homeless as bums who drink,
but that's not true,'' she said. ``People really need to know it
can happen to anybody.''

   The nation's top savings and loan official
pleaded with Congress on Tuesday to give President Bush's thrift
bailout program a chance to work before changing or scrapping it.
   ``What we need now is stability. Constant tinkering, even with
the best of intentions, imposes tremendous costs on the industry,
the regulatory system and the American public,'' said Salvatore
Martoche, acting director of the Treasury Department's Office of
Thrift Supervision.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., and his House Banking subcommittee
on financial institutions, are reviewing suggestions for changing
the S&amp;L law enacted nearly eight months ago. Tuesday's session was
the third of five scheduled.
   Proposals range from abolishing the thrift office and dividing
its duties among commercial bank regulators to providing temporary
relief from lending rules that some home builders say are crimping
their credit.
   Martoche conceded that some changes might improve the law, but
said the benefits were outweighed by the potential harm of
disruptive changes.
   ``I've been around legislative bodies long enough to know that
when you do a reopener, everything but the kitchen sink gets taken
up,'' he said.
   The S&amp;L law sharply reduced the maximum amount an institution
can loan to one borrower. The intent was to prevent the bankruptcy
of a single customer from severely hurting a thrift. However,
builders complain that they can't get the loans they need and say
the limit should be phased in gradually.
   Martoche said the thrift office is leaning toward phasing in the
restrictions over two years, but is uncertain whether the law will
permit that. The agency has given industry lawyers 60 days to
suggest a ``creative solution'' to the dilemma, he said.
   On another matter, Martoche said he was not concerned about the
agency's slow pace in reviewing financial plans submitted by ailing
thrifts by Jan. 7. The S&amp;L law required weak institutions to get
goverment approval for their plans to raise capital.
   So far, 577 S&amp;Ls have submitted plans. The thrift office has
rejected 127, approved 64, and told many institutions to ``go back
to the drawing board,'' Martoche said. Later Tuesday, the agency
announced it was extending its deadline for approving the plans
from the end of March to the end of April.
   ``I can't help but feel that some institutions were testing us''
to see if lax plans would be approved, he said. ``I want them
(agency employees) to do the right thing and however long it takes,
it takes.''
   Martoche, who is an assistant Treasury secretary, began the
thrift job on an acting basis only three weeks ago, after M. Danny
Wall left the position under fire. He is already a lame duck.
   In response to lawsuits from weak S&amp;Ls challenging the
constitutional authority of both Wall and Martoche, President Bush
last week nominated T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to a five-year term as the
permanent director of the thrift office.
   The Senate Banking Committee has scheduled a confirmation
hearing on Wednesday for Ryan, formerly the top lawyer at the Labor
Department from 1981 to 1983.
   In another development, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
approved a controversial plan to pump money into ailing S&amp;Ls before
they fail. To qualify, institutions must be in one of eight
economically troubled states, managers must be subject to firing,
shareholders must be treated ``approximately'' as if the S&amp;L had
failed and new private investment must be injected into the S&amp;L
along with the government funds.
   However, it remains unclear if the policy will ever be used.
Another agency, the Treasury Department-led Resolution Trust Corp.
Oversight Board has expressed reservations. The board would have to
approve any spending for thrift assistance.
   ``I hate the notion of giving shareholders, who were responsible
for running an institution down the tubes, any benefit of a
bailout,'' Martoche said. ``I personally find that abhorrent.''
   Several members of the House banking panel also opposed the
policy, including Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a task
force overseeing the bailout.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, however, says open thrift
assistance can be cheaper for taxpayers in some cases.
   Institutions in eight states will be eligible: Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.

   Six center-right and liberal parties
advanced to the second round of campaigning Tuesday to try to win
enough support in runoff elections to form Hungary's first
post-war, non-Communist government.
   Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National Electoral Committee, said
the final tally in Sunday's parliamentary elections was delayed
because the Interior Ministry's electoral office had given the
committee incomplete information.
   Nemeth did not specify whether he thought the Interior Ministry,
which many Hungarians still associate with communist repression
because of its control of internal security, was purposely delaying
results showing a poor performance by Old Guard Communists.
   They refused to join Communist reformers in founding the
Socialist Party in October and failed to win 4 percent of the
national vote, necessary to gain representation in parliament.
   A ministry official, who declined to give his name on the
telephone, said the delay in reporting results was due to slow
transmission of votes from outlying polling stations.
   The Electoral Committee announced unofficial, final results, but
said the elections would have to be repeated in five districts
where fewer than half the eligible voters turned out, the state
news agency MTI reported.
   The conservative Hungarian Democratic Forum received 24.7
percent of the vote to maintain its edge over the center-left
League of Free Democrats, who won 21.4 percent.
   The rural-based Independent Smallholders finished third with
11.7 percent, followed by the Socialists _ the successors to
Hungary's Communist Party _ with 10.9 percent.
   The League of Young Democrats won 8.9 percent and the Christian
Democratic People's Party 6.4 percent.
   The rest of the 29 parties that ran did not clear the 4 percent
hurdle.
   More than 70 percent of Hungary's 7.8 million eligible voters
cast ballots, election officials said.
   Only five of the parliament's 394 seats were decided.
   Since neither of the two leading parties garnered anything close
to the absolute majority needed for decisive victory, a coalition
government is likely after runoff elections are held next month,
possibly April 8.
   The biggest issue is Hungary's economy, which is beset by
double-digit inflation and a $20 billion foreign debt after four
decades of Communist rule.
   The Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats both want to move
toward market-oriented reforms, but the Forum wants to move more
slowly.
   Both parties have said they do not want to join with the other
in building a coalition government, and the Independent
Smallholders are expected to play a key role in such a government.

   The Soviet Union defended on Tuesday its
seizure of army deserters from two hospitals in Lithuania and
appealed for understanding in the United States of its attempt to
maintain order in the secessionist-minded Baltic republic.
   ``Deserters are dealt with harshly in other countries as well,''
Sergei Chetverikov, minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy, said
at a news conference. He cited a statement by Vice President Dan
Quayle as supporting action against deserters.
   And yet, the Soviet official emphasized that Moscow, while
defending its authority in Vilnius, was trying not to use force
against Lithuanians.
   ``The basic premise which is behind the action of the Soviet
government is not to use force, not to use intimidation or anything
of that sort, to find peaceful ways, peaceful solutions,'' he said.
   ``But the situation is difficult, as well all know, so we hope
we will be understood in other countries and in this country as
well,'' Chetverikov said.
   He spoke to reporters in a chandeliered reception room
overlooking Washington's 16th Street, where some 100 demonstrators,
many of them waving Lithuanian flags in a soft breeze, shouted
their protests of the Soviet moves in a republic they contend is an
independent nation.
   ``No more tanks, no more tanks,'' they chanted.
   Their protests could be heard over the Soviet official's
statement and his replies to reporters' questions.
   In Vilnius, the capital of the republic, the deserters were
forcibly seized by Soviet troops, leaving a trail of blood behind.
   ``I don't know how they will be dealt with in this particular
case,'' Chetverikov said. ``But they have been given appropriate
time to get back to their units, and I think this is very
understandable from the point of view of any commander who is
dealing with deserters in his own unit.''
   The Soviet diplomat, an authority on constitutional law, added:
``So I don't see this as any indication of the use of force or
anything of that sort.''
   In defense of the action, Chetverikov said ``even Vice President
Quayle admitted the other day there should be some discipline in
the army.''
   Quayle told reporters in Phoenix on Saturday that the Soviets
should not threaten Lithuania, But, he said, ``if the Soviet Union
is applying disciplinary measures to people in their own military,
that's a different situation.''
   The vice president added: ``I do not know what kind of
contractual agreement a member of the Soviet army has when he or
she signs up,''
   But, Quayle said, there is a ``certain element of discipline
that is absolutely imperative in any armed force.''
   The vice president was on vacation Tuesday in Hawaii with his
wife and three children. His press secretary, David Beckwith, said
Quayle's comment ``was in the context of urging the Soviet Union
and Lithuania to resolve the situation through negotiation and
without any use of force. He did state that the desertion question
was somewhat complicated. But he in no way countenanced the violent
rounding up of deserters.''
   Separately, Beckwith said in a written statement that Soviet
authorities ``appear to be broadcasting false reports'' suggesting
that Quayle endorsed the violent capture of deserters. In
particular, he said the Tass news agency had published a report
quoting Quayle as saying, ``The Soviet Union, as an annexing power,
has the right to hunt down Lithuanian deserters.''
   Chetverikov said he hoped other deserters would return to their
units.
   ``I don't mean to say other deserters will be hunted down,'' he
said. ``But the army has the full right to maintain discipline in
its ranks.''
   On the secession itself, the Soviet official said Moscow
recognizes the need for political change in Lithuania. ``Nobody
denies the right of self-determination,'' he said.
   But, Chetverikov said, ``what the Soviet government is opposed
to is the intention of Lithuanian authorities to take over federal
property that doesn't being to them.''
   He also questioned that a majority of Lithuanians support
secession from the union.

   The Bush administration began beaming American
television to Cuba on Tuesday _ MTV videos, a 1971 World Series
tape and an old ``Kate and Allie'' _ but the communist government
jammed the transmissions and accused the United States of
aggression.
   ``We regret that Cuba has refused to permit the free flow of
information and ideas,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said.
   Testing of the long-planned TV Marti began on Channel 13 at 1:45
a.m. EST. In Havana, viewers saw a test pattern ``strong and
clear.''
   Two hours later came videos from MTV dubbed in Spanish, the
World Series tape _ the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Baltimore
Orioles in seven games _ and an episode of ``Kate and Allie,'' the
long-running sitcom about two divorced women who share a Manhattan
apartment with their children.
   After that, viewers saw ``a report on the success of Hispanics
in this country,'' said Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman of the
Miami-based organization that oversees TV Marti.
   Frank Calzon, who heads the Washington office of Freedom House,
a pro-democracy group, blasted TV Marti's show selection.
   ``The programs stink,'' said Calzon, a Cuban exile who is a
long-time TV Marti supporter. He said the debut should have
featured the opening of the Berlin Wall and the Chilean and
Nicaraguan elections.
   Officials of the Voice of America responded that the programming
was aimed at determining the technical feasibility of the
transmissions more than influencing Cuban public opinion.
   While viewers in outlying areas of Havana had few problems
during the five-hour test, residents of downtown Havana encountered
the signal of a Cuban jamming transmitter after the first 23
minutes of the test pattern.
   Mas Canosa said Castro jammed not just Channel 13, but three
domestic stations as well, in case TV Marti changed channels.
   Cuban spokesmen have said they would retaliate beyond the
jamming, but there was no immediate announcement of additional
measures.
   Last Friday, however, Cuba broadcast a radio speech by President
Fidel Castro to the United States. AM stations along the Florida
coast and as far away as Nashville were disrupted.
   Of TV Marti's premiere, the official Cuban news agency Prensa
Latina said:
   ``The debut was nothing impressive since in a 10-minute interval
the principal technological power on the planet could not keep the
invading signal from being rejected over the coverage area.
   ``Cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and Washington may
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression.''
   The Cuban government, the agency said, ``has placed
responsibility on the government of that country for all the
consequences of this action, which is aggressive and violates its
sovereignty.''
   Mas Canosa reviewed the first broadcast differently, saying that
several viewers in Cuba had phoned relatives in Miami to say they
were ``very, very enthused, extremely satisfied and really
excited.''
   The station is a TV version of Radio Marti, which has provided
news and entertainment to Cuban listeners since 1985. Radio Marti
was not jammed Tuesday morning nor did Cuba interfere with radio or
television stations in the United States.
   The TV Marti signal was sent from an antenna aboard a balloon
dangling 10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key off the South Florida coast.
Technical problems have delayed testing for months.
   The project has had strong support from conservative elements of
the Cuban exile community who believe that televised exposes about
the demise of communism around the world will weaken Castro's rule.
   Once the testing ends, the Bush administration has three months
to make a legal and technical evaluation of the operation,
according to the legislation that authorized the station.
   Ms. Tutwiler said international agreements do not prevent a
country from engaging in television broadcasting to another
country. She also noted that the U.N. Universal Declaration of
Human Rights entitles all people to the freedom to ``seek, receive
and impart information and ideas through the media.''
   Ariel Ricardo, a spokesman at the Cuban diplomatic mission here,
disagreed with the U.S. position, asserting that an international
agreement reached in 1982 gives each country exclusive control over
its own television programming.
   Ricardo said ``there is no precedent'' for one country taking
over a domestic channel of another country. He added that in parts
of the Havana area, Channel 13 is reserved for domestic programming.
   According to Cuban officials, more than 90 percent of Cuban
homes have television. The TV Marti project is designed mostly for
the Havana area.
   In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Gary Gonzalez,
a vice president of the Cuban Institute of Radio and Television,
said U.S. descriptions of Cuba as a closed society are misleading.
   He said 42 percent of all movies shown on Cuban television are
American-made. There are also a number of U.S.-made programs for
children shown in Cuba.

<HEAD>Suriname Frees Guerrilla Leader, 10 Rebels Arrested After Shootout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday freed a
guerrilla leader and 10 of his men arrested by the army after a
shootout in which two rebels died. The rebel chief had come to the
capital for peace talks.
   Presidential spokeswoman Claudine Vermunt said the government
decided to release former army Sgt. Ronny Brunswijk, chief of the
Jungle Commando rebels, and his comrades after discussions with the
attorney general's office.
   Earlier Tuesday, gunmen seized the Afobaka hydroelectric dam 125
miles south of Paramaribo in apparent retaliation for the arrests.
Power was knocked out briefly to this capital city of 200,000 and
work was disrupted at a nearby aluminum smelter.
   Although his guerrilla movement denied involvement, Brunswijk
issued a message from prison telling the Jungle Commando such
action was unnecessary.
   The military leveled unspecified drug charges against Brunswijk
relating to Jungle Commando seizure of 2,200 pounds of unrefined
cocaine from Colombia.
   Brunswijk had said his men confiscated the cocaine Sunday from a
plane flying out of Cali, Colombia, that landed because of bad
weather near a rebel base in the western village of Moenjo.
   He and his aides were held overnight at Fort Zeelandia, an army
post in the capital. The army had said Brunswijk and three aides
were taken into custody, but officials said 11 in all were seized.
   Two Brunswijk bodyguards were killed in a gun battle with
soldiers during the arrest in the capital. No details were
available.
   The rebels, who say they represent the Bush Negro minority, had
been in Paramaribo since Friday for new talks with government
officials on ending their 3{-year-old insurgency. Bush Negroes, who
make up about 10 percent of Suriname's 400,000 residents, want
greater economic development for their region.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonomity, said
the military made the arrests without consulting with the
government. The army has shown a growing tendency this year to
exercise power independent of the government.
   Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, the army chief who was the military
ruler of Suriname from, 1980 to 1988, opposes a tentative peace
agreement release last June. He complains that it fails to disarm
the Jungle Commando, which numbers from 200 to 400 members.
Bouterse has continued to wield power behind the scenes even though
the country is under nominal civilian rule.
   Before the rebels' release, the Jungle Commando said in a
statement that the arrests ``disrupted the peace process,'' but
that it would continue to abide by a cease-fire agreement reached
with the army weeks ago.
   President Ramsewak Shankar's office said the army's action would
``doubtless demand a reorientation with regard to the peace
process'' but that the government would continue the effort.
   Shankar replaced Bouterse in a 1988 election.
   In the Netherlands, the Dutch government earlier Tuesday said it
was ``seriously concerned'' about the arrest by the military
``without prior knowledge of the civilian authorities.''
   Suriname, which lies on the northern shoulder of South America,
gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Tells Council to Work toward Radical Economic Reform</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Lithuania, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the first
meeting of the new Presidential Council on Tuesday it must start
figuring out at once how to introduce substantive reforms to
resurrect the economy.
   The council advises Gorbachev in the much more powerful
presidency that he pushed through Parliament this month.
   Almost all 16 council members are newly appointed. Among those
who attended Tuesday were Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, writer
Chingiz Aitmatov and KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, the official
news agency Tass said.
   Gorbachev told the council its immediate task was to formulate
``specific measures to radicalize the economic reform,'' Soviet TV
reported.
   He said later in a television interview that the council's next
meeting will focus specifically on economic reform.
   The economy is foundering as drastic shortages of basic items
continue, ranging from soap to sausage, and there continues too to
be an overabundant money supply and a slump in production in this
nation of 265 million residents.
   An anchorman read Gorbachev's lengthy speech instead of its
being broadcast as it was delivered. Soviet TV offered no
explanation.
   Gorbachev has promised to use his enhanced presidency to
accelerate the Soviet economy's transition to a more
market-oriented set-up.
   He called for a ``normal, full-fledged market'' on Tuesday, for
eliminating the state budget deficit and for introducing price
reforms. He emphasized the importance of a new law on land meant to
increase food production by allowing farmers to virtually own their
plots.
   Gorbachev made almost no mention of the turmoil in Lithuania,
according to the official report of his speech. He said only that
he planned to hold a meeting Friday of his other new advisory body,
the Federation Council, which is expected to focus on the
relationship between Moscow and the 15 Soviet republics.
   ``Life and processes we are encountering in Transcaucasia, the
Baltic republics, especially in Lithuania, and other regions
necessitate the urgent examination and settlement of appropriate
issues,'' he said.
   The Presidential Council is seen as a mechanism to help
Gorbachev transfer political power from the Communist Party to the
government.

<HEAD>Japan Offered to Help Free Hostages, According to Hearst Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan once volunteered to give Iran and Syria
$60 million in economic aid if those countries would use their
influence to help release American hostages in Lebanon, a former
White House official told Hearst News Service.
   The deal, to which President Reagan reportedly agreed with
enthusiasm in June 1985, fell through because Iran and Syria
rejected the Japanese offer on the grounds they had no influence
over the captors, said the former official.
   The Hearst article, appearing at various times in Hearst
newspapers and made available by the service on Tuesday, did not
identify the former official.
   Former Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga came to the White
House on several occasions to discuss the deal, Hearst said.
   Reagan's knowledge of Japan's offer came three months before the
United States first shipped weapons to Iran in what grew into the
Iran-Contra scandal, Hearst said.
   Eight Americans are currently held hostage in Lebanon, but in
June 1985 there were only six. The hostages are thought to be held
by radical Moslem Shiites in Beirut under the influence of Iran.
   Terry Anderson, the longest-held American hostage, was captured
on March 16, 1985. He was chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. One of the Americans, William Buckley, the former
CIA station chief in Beirut, died in captivity, apparently in 1985.
   In Tokyo, an official at the ministry of foreign affairs said it
would be ``just impossible'' for the Japanese to have made such an
offer. Reagan could not be reached for comment, Hearst said.
   Robert McFarlane, the former national security advisor who
Hearst said knew about the offer, did not return a telephone call.
His attorney, Leonard Garment, was out of the country.
   According to the Hearst account, the Japanese offer came about
in the following fashion:
   Matsunaga brought the offer to McFarlane, according to the
former White House official who was present at the meeting.
   ``I am instructed to say that my government would like to be
helpful and that we are willing to go to both capitals'' _ Tehran
and Damascus _ ``to urge their efforts to release the hostages,''
the former official quoted Matsunaga as telling McFarlane.
   The ambassador, who left Washington last year, mentioned the $60
million aid program his government was willing to offer.
   Matsunaga ``really wanted to be sure they were going to get
credit with the president for anything they did,'' the official
said.
   The next day, McFarlane presented the Japanese offer to Reagan.
The president responded, ``Gosh! Terrific! Please!,'' the former
U.S. official said.
   But the deal was never reached because the Japanese were unable
to persuade the Iranians and the Syrians to agree to it, the
official said.
   It was not clear what Japan hoped to get in exchange for tying
its aid package to the hostages' release.
   Arthur Liman, the former chief counsel of the JOint House-Senate
Iran-Contra Committee that investigated the arms-for-hostages
scandal, said he could not comment because ``whatever I know on
this is classified.''

Tuesday to prevent trucks used to ship food from hauling garbage on
the return trip.
   The legislation, which is opposed by the Bush administration,
would also require that asbestos, infectious waste and other
health-threatening items be shipped only in vehicles designated for
that purpose.
   The vote was 410-15 to send the proposal to the Senate, where
similar bills are pending.
   The bill's prime target is ``backhauling,'' the practice of
using trucks that carry food cross-country to carry municipal
garbage on the trip home.
   ``Backhauling is dangerous, disgusting and legal,'' Rep. William
Clinger, R-Pa., one of the measure's prime sponsors, said during
the brief floor debate on the legislation.
   Concern about food-garbage hauls arose after the Centre Daily
Times of State College, Pa., reported a year ago that refrigerated
food-hauling trucks, known as ``reefers,'' were being loaded with
municipal solid waste.
   The report led Congress to investigate a related practice _
alternating loads of chemicals with shipments of juice or edible
oils. An Oregon trucker's shipment log released by a House panel at
an October hearing included loads of cooking oil, wine, apple
juice, fire retardant, marine lubricant and lime sulphur.
   Several trucking groups have said that concern by food companies
has led many truckers to avoid the practice. But Clinger and Rep.
Chris Smith, R-N.J., said checks by their staffs have confirmed
that backhauling is continuing.
   The government says it has not uncovered any instances of
contamination due to backhauling.
   The Bush administration has opposed the backhauling ban largely
because of a provision that the Department of Transportation would
assume enforcement responsibility.
   Alan I. Roberts, a hazardous materials specialist with the
department, told a Senate panel three weeks ago that existing law
``is adequate to regulate the handling and transportation of food.''
   If a bill were approved, he said lead responsibility should more
properly rest with the agencies that have food-safety expertise _
the Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``The administration has yet to see fit to correct these
practices,'' said Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio. ``Evidently the
Department of Transportation thinks it is the problem of the Food
and Drug Administration; the FDA thinks it's a transportation
problem, and the EPA, which has jurisdiction over solid waste,
doesn't know what to think.''
   Voting against the bill were Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas; Dick
Armey, R-Texas; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Larry Combest, R-Texas; Philip
Crane, R-Ill.; William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Tom DeLay, R-Texas;
Robert Dornan, R-Calif.; Jack Fields, R-Texas; Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn.; James Hansen, R-Utah; Edward Madigan, R-Ill.; Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont.; Howard Nielson, R-Utah, and Norman Shumway,
R-Calif.
   Not voting were Reps. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.; Jim Bates, D-Calif.;
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.; Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn.; Jim Leach,
R-Iowa; Denny Smith, R-Ore., and Bob Stump, R-Ariz.

   Snow flurries fell along the shores of Lake Ontario on Monday
and showers persisted across parts of Texas and Oklahoma, but skies
were clear across much of the country.
   Scattered snow was reported in northwest New York state and
along Lake Ontario, and rain fell in scattered bursts over central
and western Texas and southwest Oklahoma.
   But across much of the rest of the nation, afternoon skies were
sunny.
   The temperature dropped to 18 degrees in Wilkes-Barre and
Scranton, Pa., tying a record low for the date set in 1971.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was minus 2 degrees
in Caribou, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 15
degrees in Limestone, Maine, to 86 in Fort Myers, Fla.

   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., on Tuesday denied
an allegation that he accepted a ride on the corporate jet of
CenTrust Savings Bank, a failed thrift institution in Miami.
   Rep. Chalmers Wylie, R-Ohio, the ranking GOP member of the House
Banking Committee, on Monday released a list of political contacts
of CenTrust Chairman David Paul. The list said Paul's desk calendar
indicated Wirth ``used Paul plane'' to attend a political dinner on
Dec. 28, 1988.
   Wirth, however, said, ``I have never been a passenger on any
plane owned by either David Paul or his S&amp;L, CenTrust.''
   Tony Cole, an aide to Wylie, said the date of the plane trip
should have been listed as Sept. 28, 1988, rather than Dec. 28.
However, he said Wylie's list accurately reflected the desk
calendar.
   Wirth's denial ``could very well be true,'' Cole said. ``Who
knows? David Paul could have put anything on his desk calendar.''

   Prosecutors on Tuesday investigated the tangled
ownership of the Happy Land Social Club to determine whether the
landlords, including actress Kathleen Turner's husband, share
responsibility in the fiery deaths of 87 people.
   The district attorney's office also said a grand jury had begun
hearing evidence against Julio Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre
who reportedly confessed to setting the fire at the illegal
discotheque early Sunday.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez allegedly bought $1 worth of gasoline and ignited it in
the doorway to the two-story unlicensed club after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked there. The club had no emergency exits
and no second-story windows; the victims had neither the time nor
the means to escape.
   The building that housed the club was leased to Happy Land's
operator by Miss Turner's husband, Jay Weiss, who in turn had
leased it from one of New York's major real estate operators, Alex
DiLorenzo III.
   McCarthy said the issue of landlord responsibility wasn't clear.
Prosecutors still had to determine whether anyone beyond the club
operator, Elias Colon, who died in the fire, knew the building had
been served with notices of building code violations.
   Weiss, through a statement by his lawyer, Roger Boyle,
acknowledged that Little Peach Realty, a company he owns with
Morris Jaffe, leased the building in 1985 from a DiLorenzo company,
Clarendon Place Corp.
   Two years later, Little Peach leased the club to Colon, but
Boyle said that since last spring the company had been trying to
evict Colon for not paying rent. The case was to have been heard in
court Wednesday.
   Boyle said Weiss would have no further statement.
   Miss Turner said through her publicist, Susan Geller in Los
Angeles: ``This is an act of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It
doesn't reflect on me or my husband.''
   Miss Turner is in New York starring in a Broadway revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.''
   According to Assistant Fire Chief William Feehan, inspectors are
supposed to serve notices of code violations on the responsible
person at the scene and not necessarily to building owners.
   The Happy Land tragedy spurred Mayor David Dinkins to reactivate
a police, fire and buildings department task force formed in the
wake of another fatal club fire.
   Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan said the agency received
nearly 1,000 calls Monday, the first day of operating a special
number for reports of illegal social clubs.
   Mulligan said the names and addresses of some 500 clubs were
divulged.
   ``The department is elated,'' Mulligan said. ``It shows the
public is aware of the problem now and there's not much you can do
about it unless the public gets involved.''
   The man charged with 87 counts of murder, Gonzalez, remained in
the prison ward of Kings County Hospital, awaiting his next court
appearance.
   According to District Attorney Robert Johnson, Gonzalez made
admissions to people he had spoken to after early Sunday's fire.
The district attorney said Gonzalez gave police a videotaped
confession later in the day in which he admitted he torched the
Happy Land with gasoline in a fit of pique against his former
girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, who worked at the club.
   ``We're going to put on (the witness stand) the girlfriend, the
guy that sold him the gasoline, the two guys he talked to _ the
neighbors _ at his house,'' McCarthy said.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline. We even cut up a hunk of
the floor and brought it in to prove the burn pattern was caused by
gasoline.''
   Ms. Feliciano escaped the fire without serious injury. One of
the four other survivors, club disc jockey Ruben Valladarez, was in
critical but stable condition at Jacobi Hospital with burns over 30
percent of this body. Hospital spokeswoman Vicki Ciampa said he had
about a 50-50 chance of survival.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German church leaders on Tuesday said an
international commission should investigate charges that some newly
elected lawmakers had links with the secret police of the ousted
Communist regime.
   The chief administrator of East Berlin's Lutheran Church,
Manfred Stolpe, was quoted in a Tuesday interview as recommending
that an impartial international commission headed by a former Swiss
president and justice minister, Kurt Furgler, investigate the
allegations.
   The charges involve some leaders of non-Communist political
parties, including the top candidate for premier. The accusations
have slowed efforts to form East Germany's first freely elected
government.
   In the interview with the Bonn-based Die Welt newspaper, Stolpe
said the commission should start its probe after East Germany's
newly elected parliament has been ``officially constituted'' in its
first sitting.
   An investigation after the parliament's first session would
``prevent any further delays in setting up the country's new
government,'' Die Welt quoted Stolpe as saying.
   Rainer Eppelmann, chairman of one of the three parties in the
alliance that won the country's first free elections March 18, said
last week that as many as 40 of the 400 newly elected lawmakers
might have been agents of the disbanded Stasi secret police.
   The Stasi once had 85,000 agents and 109,000 informers and
controlled all walks of life on behalf of the Communist government.
   Outgoing Premier Hans Modrow, a reform-minded Communist,
disbanded the secret police under pressure for change brought on by
the peaceful revolution.
   Berlin's Roman Catholic bishop, Georg Sterzinsky, said he agreed
with Stolpe's recommendation. He added that former Austrian
President Rudolf Kirschschlaeger could be another candidate to head
the commission.
   Since the disbanding of the secret police, officials have
debated on how to integrate into society the large number of former
secret police workers, who are finding it difficult to find new
employment.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was quoted as
saying in an interview with the Freiburg-based Badischer Zeitung
newspaper that a ``generous amnesty'' for the former Stasi members
could ``prevent further instability'' in East Germany.
   ``Not everyone who was forced to report to the Stasi was a
criminal,'' Schaeuble was quoted as saying.
   However, ex-Stasi agents ``involved in capital crimes'' would
have to be punished, the newspaper quoted Schaueble as saying.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the chairman of East Germany's Christian
Democratic Union, which won the most votes March 18, said he hoped
the new parliament could convene next Tuesday.
   De Maiziere has been accused of having worked for the secret
police, allegations he denies. De Maiziere said he hoped to form a
coalition government by mid-April following talks with other
political parties. He is expected to become the premier.

   A CBS pitch for younger viewers was, like,
totally shredded, and ABC's teen-age doctor, ``Doogie Howser,
M.D.'' failed to cure rating ills in a special episode after
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' according to Nielsen numbers
released Tuesday.
   ``The Cosby Show,'' on NBC was first in the ratings for the week
ended March 25, followed by a repeat of ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' and ``Roseanne,'' both on ABC, according to the figures
from A.C. Nielsen Co.
   For the week, NBC was first in the ratings with a 14.2 average,
followed by ABC with 12.2 and CBS with 8.9. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   The week included late-season new show premieres on CBS and NBC
and a television movie on Fox to introduce a new series, ``The
Outsiders.''
   On CBS, Wednesday viewers got their first look at the new
half-hour situation comedy ``Normal Life,'' starring Moon Unit and
Dweezil Zappa, the daughter and son of musician Frank Zappa. The
two play the son and daughter of a playwright.
   ``Normal Life'' was paired with the debut of ``Sydney,'' a
30-minute show starring Valerie Bertinelli as a feisty private
detective in Los Angeles.
   The numbers for the youth-oriented shows are probably gagging
the No. 3 network, with ``Normal Life'' tied for 68th place and
``Sydney'' tied for 60th.
   The best-rated premiere during the week was NBC's ``A Family For
Joe,'' starring Robert Mitchum. The Saturday night show was No. 31.
   On Fox, ``The Outsiders'' about a tough gang of teen-age boys
set in 1966 Tulsa, Okla., was No. 64, failing to hold a strong
Sunday night lead-in from Fox's best-rated shows, ``The Simpsons''
and ``Married ... With Children,'' which finished 14th and 13th,
respectively.
   Another show that failed to keep the flag Sunday night was the
``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' special, shown at 8:30 p.m. after
``America's Funniest Home Videos.'' It was in the same slot as the
mid-season show ``Elvis,'' which had slammed against ``The
Simpsons.''
   The ``Doogie Howser'' special failed to hang on to the strong
22.6 lead of ``America's Funniest,'' getting only 13.0 for a
three-way tie for 36th place.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC, 23.2; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 22.6;
``Roseanne,'' ABC, 22.4; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 21.1; ``A Different
World,'' NBC, 20.8; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 20.5; ``The Golden Girls,''
NBC, 20.3; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 19.4; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC,
19.3; ``L.A. Law,'' NBC, 18.7.
   ``The Old Man and the Sea,'' a made-for-television version of
the Ernest Hemingway book starring Anthony Quinn as the fisherman,
was the top-rated movie for the week at No. 22.
   An NBC News special looking at ``The New Hollywood'' was in 57th
place.
   In the nightly news shows, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was
first in averages for the 11th week in a row with a 10.5 rating.
``NBC Nightly News'' was second with 9.4, followed by the ``CBS
Evening News'' with 8.9.
   The highest-rated of CBS' prime time NCAA basketball semifinals
was a 47th place tie for Friday games between Syracuse and
Minnesota and Loyola Marymount vs. Alabama.

   The world's only recipient of a
heart-liver-kidney transplant died of kidney failure brought on by
an unusual form of hepatitis nearly four months after the
operation, a hospital spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Cindy Martin, 26, died Monday evening at Presbyterian-University
Hospital, said spokeswoman Lisa Rossi. Mrs. Martin's family,
including her husband, John, were with her when she died.
   The resident of the Scranton suburb of Archbald underwent a
21{-hour operation Dec. 2-3 in which the heart, the liver and the
kidney were transplanted one after another.
   Mrs. Martin contracted recurrent non-A, non-B hepatitis, an
unusual and non-contagious form of the liver disease which resulted
in kidney failure, doctors said.
   Her condition was further complicated by an overwhelming
infection called sepsis, a common post-transplant complication, Ms.
Rossi said.
   Infection is a common problem with transplant patients because
of the use of anti-rejection drugs, which suppress the immune
system, Ms. Rossi said.
   Since the surgery, Mrs. Martin's condition never improved beyond
serious and she often breathed with the aid of a respirator, Ms.
Rossi said. Last weekend, Mrs. Martin's condition deteriorated to
critical.
   Mrs. Martin had suffered from familial cardiomyopathy, an
inherited heart disease. Her father died at age 31 and many
relatives on his side of the family have died young, her husband
said in December.
   On Oct. 20, 1985, one day after getting married, Mrs. Martin was
admitted to Presbyterian-University to await her first heart
transplant. She received it a month later.
   She subsequently developed hepatitis and kidney dysfunction and
suffered from chronic rejection of the heart, which led to the
multiple transplant, the hospital said.
   There had been no sign of rejection of the heart since December,
Ms. Rossi said.
   Multi-organ transplants have been performed several times, but
this was the first involving all three organs, said Dr. John
Armitage, who performed Mrs. Martin's heart transplant.
   Doctors plan to perform similar operations should the need arise.
   ``We're not recruiting patients with heart, liver and kidney
problems,'' Ms. Rossi said. ``But I would imagine if someone
presented themselves again who was in critical need of this
combination of organs we wouldn't hesitate to give them a second
chance.''

<HEAD>Peres Dealt Setback to Form Gov't, Schach Remarks Upset Parties</HEAD>

   Shimon Peres suffered an apparent setback to
form a new coalition government on Tuesday when three left-wing
parties suspended talks with the Labor Party leader, Israel radio
reported.
   The Citizens Rights Movement, Mapam and Shinui parties, which
hold 10 parliament seats, said they were postponing coalition talks
until it becomes clear Peres still has a good chance to form a
government, the report said.
   Peres said he will push for early elections for the 120-member
parliament if he fails to form a new government rather than give
the rival right-wing Likud bloc an opportunity to establish a
coalition.
   Earlier in the day, politicians from both the left and right
found themselves in rare agreement when they defended kibbutzim
following an ultra-Orthodox rabbi's criticism of the secular
lifestyle of Israel's communal agricultural settlements.
   Kibbutzim are held in high esteem in Israel for their history of
settling and defending the country.
   But in a speech Monday night, Rabbi Eliezer Schach, the
93-year-old spiritual leader of two small ultra-Orthodox religious
parties, accused the communal settlements of abandoning Judaism.
   ``There are kibbutzim that don't know what Yom Kippur is or the
Sabbath ... and they raise (non-kosher) rabbits and pigs,'' Schach
said. ``Do they have any links with their forefathers?''
   Peres praised the kibbutzim, which constitute the core of Labor
support, but refrained from criticizing Schach in an apparent
effort not to alienate the rabbi.
   ``This is not the sum total of what the kibbutzim have done in
this country,'' Peres said. ``They built the land, they settled it
... they spilled their blood for this country.''
   Yossi Sarid of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement argued that
ultra-Orthodox Jews, most of whom are exempt from army service,
have done little for Israel.
   ``We've already tried the security doctrine of the Rabbi Schach
more than once, the last time in the Holocaust,'' he told Israel
radio, alluding to criticism that Jews did not defend themselves
against the World War II genocide in which 6 million Jews were
killed by Nazi Germany.
   Also speaking on Israel radio, Likud hard-liner Ariel Sharon
stressed that ways must be found ``for all streams of Judaism to
live side by side in peace.''
   Labor legislator Yossi Beilin said efforts to bridge the gap
between religious and secular Israelis had been put ``a step
backwards of decades'' by Shach's remarks.
   Schach, in his speech before 12,000 cheering followers in a Tel
Aviv basketball arena, also sharply attacked the Labor Party,
saying it had failed to keep Israel on the path of Judaism.
   ``Labor has severed the link, severed itself from the Torah,
from the Sabbath and the past,'' the rabbi said.
   Political analysts said Schach's remarks made it unlikely that
the ultra-Orthodox Degel Hatorah and Shas parties, which hold a
combined eight seats in parliament and are loyal to Schach, would
leave the Likud camp and join a Peres-led government.
   Both Labor and Likud claim the support of 60 members of
Parliament. To break the tie, Peres needs the backing of one of the
religious parties to rule. The Degel Torah party has two seats and
the Shas party has six.
   ``If it is true what the commentators are saying, we basically
have to hold new elections,'' Peres told Israel radio, adding he
would continue his efforts to form a new government.
   But caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, head of Likud, told
reporters Tuesday that he opposed early elections because, ```I
don't think it's healthy for a country to hold elections in such
short periods of time. ... The last elections were a year and a
half ago.''
   The coalition negotiations began after Shamir was toppled by a
no-confidence motion in Parliament earlier this month over his
refusal to accept U.S. Mideast peace proposals.
   Peres has five more weeks to try to put together a coalition. If
he fails, President Chaim Herzog could then ask Shamir, an option
Labor wants to prevent.

   A House agriculture subcommittee postponed
action on a new peanut price support program Tuesday after
closed-door negotiations between peanut farmers and manufacturers
failed to produce agreement.
   Rep. Charles Rose, D-N.C., chairman of the tobacco and peanuts
subcommittee, said the panel will try ``one last time'' to win the
support of the manufacturers for the peanut section of the 1990
farm bill before meeting again Wednesday or Thursday to write the
subcommittee version.
   Rose said the manufacturers have dropped their demand for a
freeze on the support price for domestic-use peanuts over the
five-year life of the new peanut program, but the two sides have
been unable to reach agreement on other, more technical issues.
   ``It seems the so-called concensus has blown up and they're
trying to put it back together,'' said John Campbell, a deputy
undersecretary of agriculture.
   The administration has proposed a 20 percent cut in the support
price for domestic-use peanuts, from $631 a ton for this year's
crop to $504 a ton. That proposal wasn't mentioned Tuesday as the
subcommittee worked through a draft bill that would keep the $631
price support and permit it to increase up to 6 percent a year to
reflect rising costs of production.

   A 14-year-old black student was shot and
slightly wounded Tuesday at a public high school by three white
teen-agers who taunted him with a racial slur, police said.
   The shooting took place in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, less
than a mile from where another black youth, 16-year-old Yusuf
Hawkins, was fatally shot during a confrontation with a group of
white teens last summer.
   Tuesday's victim was taken to Coney Island Hospital for
treatment of a gunshot wound to the right wrist, according to
Detective Joseph McConville.
   The shooting occurred at 8:42 a.m. inside New Utrecht High
School, McConville said. The department's Bias Incident
Investigation Unit was assigned to the case and arrests were
expected, he added.
   The youths involved in the shooting had clashed with an older
black teen-ager last month, McConville said. He said the
14-year-old who was shot had tried to act as a peacemaker in that
dispute.
   Tuesday's confrontation occurred as the black teen passed the
three white youths in a basement stairwell. One of the whites
asked, ``What are you looking at?'' and called him by a racial
epithet, McConville said.
   He said the black teen-ager told police he replied, ``If I were
looking at you, I'd tell you.''
   One of the white youths then pointed a gun at the 14-year-old
and shot him. Police found a shell at the shooting scene, but did
not say what kind of gun was used.

   Hal and Carol Hill and some friends leave
Thursday for Muddy Gut Hollow, Ky. It's a sort of working vacation:
they plan to build a house for Willie and Sandra Johnson.
   The Hills don't know the Johnsons very well, but they know they
need help. After seeing a television program about rural poverty in
Appalachia, Hal Hill said, ``We decided to see if we could make a
little difference and help somebody out.''
   The CBS program was ``48 Hours: Another America,'' which focused
on the poor living conditions of Floyd County, Ky., and the work of
Christian Appalachian Project's building program.
   Hill, co-owner of Specialty Forest Products, a lumber and
building products company, contacted the organization offering
supplies and his talents.
   The agency put him in contact with the Johnsons, an unemployed
couple with two infant children and no home of their own.
   The Hills, who live about 40 miles south of Atlanta in Griffin,
will be taking about 10 volunteers to Muddy Gut Hollow, near
Wheelwright, Ky. By the end of the weekend, they plan to turn a
little hard work and about $3,000 in building supplies into at
least a shell of a modest new home.
   ``It's not large or luxurious by any standard,'' Hill said
Monday.
   The caravan also will carry furniture and clothing collected by
Mrs. Hill for the family.
   Hill said he has traveled to the area to survey the site and
meet the family. The Johnsons, he said, already are planting a
garden near the site.
   ``They're already looking at it as a home. It's very pleasing to
see the anticipation they have,'' he said. ``We're just glad we've
got the opportunity to do this.''

   A barrage of on-screen Oscar flaps and
overseas satellite feeds failed to rivet television viewers to the
62nd Academy Awards. The show drew its smallest audience in three
years.
   According to preliminary ratings figures released Tuesday by
ABC, the Monday night show had a rating of 27.9, or less than 26
million U.S. homes with televisions. Forty-eight percent of all
television sets in use were tuned to the show, according the A.C.
Nielsen Co. estimates.
   Last year's much-criticized Oscar show with Rob Lowe and Snow
White was seen in nearly 27 million homes, and 1988's telecast was
more popular than this year's edition, too.
   The broadcast in 1987, when ``Platoon'' took the best picture
trophy, was rated lower than Monday's show.
   Highlighting this year's Oscar presentation were several
comments critical of the Oscar nominating process.
   Bruce Beresford, the director of top Academy Award winner
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' spent Oscar night in Africa. It didn't
matter, because the director wasn't in line for a trophy at the
awards ceremony here.
   Not since 1932's ``Grand Hotel'' has the best picture winner
failed to receive a best director nomination.
   The Beresford slight _ and the shutout of Spike Lee's ``Do the
Right Thing'' _ sparked grumbling into the early morning hours
Tuesday.
   Lee said ``Miss Daisy'' was chosen over his film because Academy
voters were more comfortable with black chauffeurs than race riots.
``Miss Daisy'' supporters were at a loss to explain why its
director was overlooked.
   ``I think it was a bewildering thing that will never be known,''
said ``Miss Daisy'' co-producer Richard Zanuck backstage after the
film was selected best picture. ``He had his stamp on this film.
Why he wasn't nominated, we'll never know.''
   Some of those who worked on the Civil War epic ``Glory''
complained, too, that their film should have been nominated for
best picture and best director. ``Glory'' won three trophies,
including best supporting actor to Denzel Washington.
   Early in the show, presenter Kim Basinger introduced the first
of the best picture nominees.
   ``We have five great films here,'' Miss Basinger said. ``And
they are great for one reason: they tell the truth.
   ``But there is one film missing from this list that deserves to
be honored because, ironically, it might tell the biggest truth of
all. And that's `Do the Right Thing.'''
   Her remarks were met with sustained applause as she thrust
clenched fists into the air, shouting ``Yes, Yes!''
   Television critics were mostly kind in their reviews of the
show. Some said it was too conventional. The broadcast ran 3 hours,
34 minutes and was marred by an echo-filled satellite feed from
Moscow. Live segments also were shown from London, Tokyo, Australia
and Buenos Aires, Argentina, designed to show that the film
industry is international.
   It was the longest show since 1984's program, which ran 42
minutes over 3 hours.

<HEAD>Doctor Who Defied Terrorist Group Shot to Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor who helped force-feed convicted
terrorists on a hunger strike was gunned down Tuesday at his office
by a woman who fled with an accomplice, police said.
   The doctor, Ramon Munoz y Fernandez, intravenously fed two
convicted terrorists during a recent hunger strike by members of
the ultra-leftist First of October Revolutionary Anti-Fascist
Group, a government official in this northeastern city said.
   Interior Ministry officials in Madrid said witnesses identified
the killer from wanted posters as Maria Jesus Romero Vega, a
suspected leader of the group.
   Police said the woman went to Munoz's office, shot him in the
head and chest and then fled. Police in Zaragoza set up roadblocks
around the city.
   Munoz worked as an internal medicine specialist at Miguel Servet
hospital, where two First of October convicts were treated and
force-fed during the two-month hunger strike.
   The convicts were returned to prison a few days ago, the
government official in Zaragoza said on condition of anonymity.
   Fifty-two convicts began the hunger strike Nov. 30, and several
of them were near death before court rulings ordered doctors to
intervene in January.
   The First of October group has claimed responsibility for more
than 30 killings of police and army officers since the 1975 attack
from which it took its name. A total of 81 group members are
serving lengthy prison terms.
   Police believed they had dismantled the group several years ago,
but it resurfaced in December and since has claimed responsibility
for the shooting deaths of two police officers and a civil guard.

<HEAD>Senate Will Limit Clean Air Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate leaders won approval Tuesday night to
limit debate on clean air legislation and scheduled a final vote on
the complex and controversial bill within a week.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said a final
vote on the bill would be held at 8 p.m. next Tuesday. The bill,
the product of lenghty private negotiations with the White House,
has been under debate for three weeks.
   The announcement by Mitchell came after the Senate grappled most
of the day with a proposal that would ease air pollution permit
requirements which industry had complained would create a
``bureaucratic nightmare.''
   The issue has closely divided the senators who first voted 50-47
to refuse to set the weakening amendment aside and then rejected
the proposal in a second vote, also 50-47.
   The clean air bill, the first tightening of federal air
pollution laws in 13 years, calls for a wide range of new pollution
controls on industry, automobiles and electric power plants in
hopes of bringing air quality within federal standards in most
urban areas by the turn of the century.
   Mitchell outlined his plans for the legislation after
discussions with the minority leader, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.; with
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., whose proposal for financial assistance
for coal miners at times has held up progress; and with the floor
managers of the bill.
   The majority leader then requested and obtained unanimous
consent from his colleagues to limit further debate on the measure
and set the time for a final vote.
   Meanwhile, behind-the-scene discussions continued in an attempt
to work out an agreement with Byrd over the coal miner assistance.
The White House has opposed the measure vigorously as being too
expensive and Senate leaders were attempting to persuade Byrd to
agree to a less costly compromise.
   Mitchell said the Byrd proposal would be set aside until
Thursday when it would be brought to a vote. The measure calls for
$500 million in assistance over three years to miners who lose
their jobs because of controls on emission of sulfur dioxide from
coal-fired electric power plants.
   The permit requirements in the clean air bill occupied the
Senate most of the day Tuesay.
   Sen. Don Nickels, R-Okla., had sought an amendment he said would
streamline the permit process, arguing that the current legislation
spells ``economic disasters for thousands of businesses'' and would
create a ``bureaucratic nightmare'' for businessmen.
   But critics said the changes sought by Nickels would allow
polluters in some cases to avoid some parts of the new law and
hinder federal enforcement. It also would allow some polluters to
tie cases up in lengthy litigation and inhibit citizen lawsuits
seeking enforcement of pollution controls, the opponents maintained.
   About 35 states already have laws requiring such permits. Under
the bill, the EPA would have broader authority to review state
permits.

   Lithuania's leaders on Tuesday angrily
accused Moscow of ``inexcusable aggression'' and of kidnapping its
citizens after Soviet troops stormed two hospitals in a harsh
roundup of army deserters.
   Later, the Kremlin ordered all foreigners to leave the republic,
which declared independence March 11. Soviet troops occupied a
fifth Communist Party building in Vilnius, the capital.
   Washington and other foreign governments urged restraint but
avoided attacking Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who faces
growing independence movements in several republics as he tries to
institute reform.
   The Bush administration, in declining to denounce Moscow, said
it did not want to ``inflame the situation.''
   Soviet officials defended their actions and condemned the
Lithuanians' aspirations as dangerous.
   ``Even Vice President Quayle admitted the other day there should
be some discipline in the army,'' Sergei Chetverikov,
minister-counselor at the Soviet Embassy, said at a news conference
in Washington.
   Quayle said Saturday the Soviets should not threaten Lithuania
but added that ``if the Soviet Union is applying disciplinary
measures to people in their own military, that's a different
situation.''
   In a furious letter to Gorbachev, Lithuania's president,
Vytautas Landsbergis, and prime minister, Kazimera Prunskiene, said
their government ``demands the return of its kidnapped citizens.''
They also urged negotiations with Moscow ``in neutral territory.''
   Both Landsbergis and Prunskiene said Gorbachev had refused their
calls.
   Soviet soldiers stormed two hospitals before dawn Tuesday and
seized 23 Lithuanian deserters who had sought refuge, the official
Tass news agency said. Lithuanian television said two genuine
mental patients were accidentally seized but that the soldiers let
them go later.
   Witnesses said some deserters were beaten as they were taken
from a run-down psychiatric hospital in Vilnius. A trail of blood
led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital.
   ``They beat them with their fists,'' said a duty nurse at the
hospital, where windows and iron beds were broken.
   Gorbachev has called Lithuania's independence declaration
invalid and last week ordered Lithuanians to turn in their weapons
and stop signing up with a volunteer militia.
   He had promised not to use force unless lives were endangered in
the Baltic republic, which the Soviet Union forcibly annexed along
with Latvia and Estonia in 1940. But military authorities had
warned Lithuania they would use force to capture deserters if the
men had not returned voluntarily by last Saturday.
   In addition to storming the hospitals, Soviet troops Tuesday
took over the Communist Party headquarters in the center of
Vilnius. It was the fifth party building Soviet forces have seized
in the republic since the weekend.
   Vladislav Shved, a leader of the Lithuanian Communist Party
faction loyal to Moscow, indicated on the nightly news program
``Vremya'' that the troops were acting directly on the faction's
request.
   When the government started to turn party offices over to other
groups, ``we had to take measures to protect our property,'' he
said.
   Thousands of opponents of independence _ Soviet television put
the estimate at 20,000 _ attended a rally Tuesday outside the
Parliament in Vilnius. The gathering lasted less than an hour and
was peaceful _ protesters did not even trespass on the grass.
   Inside, Parliament officials, convinced the crowd might try to
storm the building, rolled out fire hoses to repel attackers.
   At a news conference in Warsaw, Poland, senior Soviet diplomats
said Lithuania's independence drive could lead to destabilization
of Europe and the rest of the world, but did not elaborate.
   A declaration read at the briefing in the Soviet Embassy
building Tuesday said ``the aspirations of the Lithuanian
leadership to speedily separate from the other nations appear
unjustified and let's say frankly dangerous.''
   It said the situation had taken on a ``sharp'' character
recently, and warned that the position of Lithuania's leaders could
have a negative effect on the course of perestroika, the name
Gorbachev gave his program of reform.
   There was little response in Moscow to the turmoil. Gorbachev
spoke for several minutes on Soviet TV Tuesday evening about the
first meeting of his new Presidential Council, an advisory body. He
never mentioned Lithuania.
   The afternoon news carried nothing about the situation. The
evening news had only a brief report focusing on the Communist
Party members in Lithuania still loyal to their parent party in
Moscow.
   The Soviet Embassy in Washington defended the seizure of army
deserters and appealed for international understanding.
   ``Deserters are dealt with harshly in other countries as well,''
Chetverikov said.
   Outside, about 100 demonstrators, many of them waving Lithuanian
flags, protested the Soviet actions. ``No more tanks! No more
tanks!'' they chanted, loudly enough for Chetverikov to hear.
   The expulsion order announced Tuesday affected foreign
journalists, businessmen and diplomats, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh.
   ``Foreigners have been asked to leave the borders of Lithuania
and temporarily refrain from entering its territory,'' Gremitskikh
told a Moscow briefing. He said foreign reporters currently in
Lithuania would be allowed to stay until their previously announced
departure dates.
   The Soviet defense minister, Dmitri T. Yazov, told reporters in
Paris on Tuesday he expected the crisis to be defused ``in a
peaceful way,'' but he said Lithuanian deserters had to be returned
to their units.
   The Lithuanian government contends the soldiers were illegally
drafted into an army of occupation, and deserters have said they
were beaten before they left the army.

   A Soviet trade official was ordered to
leave Sweden for alleged espionage, the foreign ministry said
Tuesday.
   In a statement, the ministry said ``the official has conducted
activities not compatible with his official status in Sweden.''
   According to the national news agency TT, the unnamed official
tried to obtain information about Swedish and foreign technology
and about Swedish industry.
   Foreign ministry spokesman Lars Olof Lundberg would not confirm
the official had diplomatic status.
   The foreign ministry said the Soviet official had already left
the country, and that no damage was caused.
   Last August a Soviet trade official at the consulate in
Gothenburg was expelled on the same charges.
   In October 1988 a Soviet trade official in Stockholm also was
expelled, accused of industrial espionage. In April 1988 a Soviet
businessman residing in Gothenburg was ordered expelled for trying
to obtain information about foreign and Swedish technology.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge temporarily banned
construction of a major observatory atop an isolated mountain where
180 endangered squirrels live. An environmentalist praised the
decision, but an astronomer called it ``a tragedy for U.S.
astronomy.''
   A University of Arizona official said Tuesday that the school
would appeal the injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Alfredo
C. Marquez.
   The order issued Monday imposes a four-month ban on construction
of the planned $200 million Mount Graham International Observatory
on a 10,700-foot-high peak of the mountain.
   The university was ready to begin building the first two of at
least three telescopes in what could become the world's most
powerful observatory.
   Congress had authorized the project on U.S. Forest Service land,
but did not provide any money.
   The remote mountaintop is home to an estimated 180 endangered
Mount Graham red squirrels. Construction opponents sought the
building ban, fearing extinction of the half-pound rodents.
   Michael A. Cusanovich, the university's vice president for
research, said Tuesday that construction would have no impact on
the squirrel and that the school would appeal the injunction to the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``I don't know what he decided it on. I'm telling you I don't
think it was decided on facts,'' said Cusanovich, who added that
given the congressional approval, ``delaying tactics are
inappropriate and are, in fact, damaging to society.''
   The judge said serious questions had been raised over whether
the construction would cause irreparable harm to the Mount Graham
red squirrel.
   ``I'm surprised. I'm encouraged,'' Robin Silver, a spokesman for
the Maricopa County Audubon Society in Phoenix, said Monday. ``This
has been a tough process all along. I'm encouraged that the system
can still work.''
   ``I think it's a tragedy for U.S. astronomy,'' said Roger Roger
Angel, head of the university's Steward Observatory mirror lab and
developer of a revolutionary process for fabricating large
telescope mirrors. ``In times of very poor funding, we're working
like crazy to try to keep our heritage of good astronomy.''
   While several European countries have financed development of
new telescopes, Angel said there has been no such commitment from
the federal government.
   Project plans call for the Columbus Project, construction of the
world's most powerful single telescope, to get underway by the
mid-1990s. The telescope would have two 8-meter mirrors, giving it
a combined viewing field equal to an instrument with a mirror 37
feet in diameter. That would be five to six times the
light-gathering power of the 5-meter Mount Palomar in California,
considered the world's most powerful.
   ``With the Columbus Project as the biggest single telescope,
we're right on the track of keeping that in the United States,''
Angel said. ``I don't know how long we can keep collaborators
together without a site for the telescope.''
   Mount Graham in the Pinaleno Mountains in southeastern Arizona
is the only known habitat for the 180 remaining squirrels.
   In 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concluded in a
biological report for the Forest Service that the telescopes could
coexist with the squirrel. Arizona's congressional delegation then
pushed through the legislation ordering the Forest Service to grant
the university a construction permit.
   But environmental groups sued, contending that perching the
telescopes on an 8.6-acre site on one of Mount Graham's three peaks
would assure the extinction of the 8-ounce squirrels by taking away
more of the forested land they need to survive.
   University officials contend poor pine cone crops in recent
years have hurt the squirrel population. They said hunting,
logging, use of off-road vehicles and Christmas tree-cutting have
been stopped because of the planned observatory, and that 60 to 80
acres will be reforested.

   U.N. officials shrugged off on Tuesday the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's threat to take the case for District of
Columbia statehood to the United Nations.
   ``The U.N. does not grant statehood to states which are members
of federations, or independent states,'' Francois Giuliani,
spokesman for the secretary-general, said Tuesday in answer to a
question. He said it is not for the United Nations to confer
statehood, but only to consider membership.
   He noted that U.N. membership is achieved through a process that
includes recommendation by the 15-member Security Council, where
the United States has veto power, and by a two-thirds vote of the
159-nation General Assembly.
   Jackson said Monday he may appeal to the United Nations as a
last resort in his attempt to win statehood for the district. He
complained that the region was denied basic human rights and
political representation, and claimed the district was under
political occupation.
   Lithuania, Tibet and other regions of U.N. member states all
have failed so far to achieve U.N. recognition, or often even to
win U.N. comment on their independence movements involving the
Soviet Union, China and other countries.
   U.N. judicial experts considered the District of Columbia as one
more such case, an internal issue for the United States to resolve.
   The United Nations frequently shuns touchy political issues,
ranging from the use of poison gas to repression of political
dissidents.
   In Washington, meanwhile, the city council voted 12-1 Tuesday to
hold elections for a ``shadow'' congressional delegation that would
press the city's quest for statehood on Capitol Hill.
   The council's vote to hold a September primary and a November
general election balloting for the posts comes after three separate
votes in recent years to postpone the elections.

   The National Transportation Safety Board on
Tuesday called for utilities to install new equipment to help
prevent explosions and fires from leaking pipes that supply natural
gas to homes.
   The board recommended ``urgent action'' by the Department of
Transportation to require the devices, called excess flow valves,
on some residential gas lines.
   In addition, the board encouraged the utility industry to
voluntarily provide customers with the opportunity to buy the
equipment and have it installed.
   The recommendations were issued as part of a report that
concluded that the devices could have helped prevent fatal natural
gas accidents in Kansas and Missouri. The valves automatically
restrict the flow of gas when certain increases occur, possibly
from a leak or rupture in the line.
   Four people were killed and a dozen injured in a series of five
explosions between September 1988 and March 1989 on KPL Gas Service
lines in the two states.
   In its report, the NTSB faulted the Kansas-based utility for
inadequate training of inspectors and a poor system for identifying
steel and cast iron lines that could be particularly prone to
corrosion and leaks.
   However, James L. Kolstad, the board chairman, said the KPL
accidents reflect problems found throughout the gas utility
industry.
   ``We don't think this is an isolated case,'' said Kolstad.
   For instance, the board said gas utilities needed to do a better
job of alerting the public to the dangers of leaks and advising
customers what to do when they smell gas odors.
   The NTSB also recommended that federal pipeline safety standards
be extended to all portions of gas lines running to customer homes
from main supply lines. Currently the regulatory protections,
including requirements for corrosion protection and inspections,
cover only service lines to a customer's meter from the main line.
   So-called yard lines, which go from the meter to the house, are
the responsiblity of homeowners and utilities have no obligation to
inspect or maintain them.
   The five-member board recommended that DOT change its
regulations to extend the safety standards and said utilities
should be required to install the excess flow valves on new high
pressure residential service lines and those being replaced.
   Recommendations of the NTSB, which operates as an independent
agency, are not binding but can serve as a catalyst for actions by
regulators, the industry or Congress.
   Board members noted that they had suggested the use of excess
flow valves in 1981 but that no government mandate had been issued.
   DOT will consider the board's recommendations, according to Mark
Dowis, executive assistant to the administrator of the Research and
Special Programs Administration.
   ``We're going to take it very seriously,'' he said.
   The agency did not pursue NTSB's earlier recommendation for
excess flow valves because of a gas industry study that cast doubts
on their usefulness, he said.
   Carl Ericson, a spokesman for the American Gas Association, said
the industry would consider the NTSB recommendations. In the past,
he said, there have been questions about the costs and
effectiveness of the devices, particularly on low pressure gas
lines that often serve residential customers.
   Several of the accidents in Kansas and Missouri involved bare
steel service lines installed before 1971, when federal safety
requirements took effect to make utilities responsible for
installing corrosion prevention systems and for inspecting for gas
leaks on the pipes owned by customers.
   NTSB recommended that DOT require utilities to safeguard all
currently unprotected gas lines over several years, either through
replacement of the lines or some corrosion protection system.

   China has accepted Indonesian proposals for
settling outstanding debts, removing the last obstacle to restoring
diplomatic relations suspended 23 years ago, the government said
Wednesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the countries concluded
four days of talks Tuesday and agreed that Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas will visit Beijing in late April or early May
to complete the settlement on Indonesia's debts to China.
   The nations suspended diplomatic relations in 1967 after
Indonesia accused China of complicity in a communist coup attempt
in 1965.
   Xinhua did not give a figure for Indonesia's debt. But it quoted
an unidentified Foreign Ministry source as saying figures presented
by the countries were for the most part identical and that China
accepted an Indonesian proposal.
   Indonesia has said it owes $50 million to China.
   The Indonesian delegation in the talks that just ended was led
by Jusuf Anwar, director of external funds of the Directorate
General of Budget of the Ministry of Finance. He met Monday with
Vice Foreign Minister Qi Huaiyuan, who welcomed what he said was
the first official Indonesian delegation to visit China since 1967.
   Agreement to normalize relations came when Indonesian President
Suharto and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met in Tokyo in
February 1989 while attending the funeral of Japan's Emperor
Hirohito.

   A tugboat captain has been charged with
negligence for allegedly veering too close to shore while pushing a
barge that ruptured and spilled 30,000 gallons of oil.
   U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Frank Whipple said Arthur Sanders,
32, of Houma, La., could have avoided Sunday's spill in the
Intracoastal Waterway by staying in shipping lanes.
   Sanders' tug was pushing the 190-foot oil barge that struck a
submerged vessel and ruptured, spilling 830 barrels of light crude
into the waterway, officials said.
   The waterway opened to two-way traffic Tuesday. One-way traffic
was restored Monday morning.
   The charge, issued late Monday, is the first step under maritime
law to a license revocation. No bond is required.
   Coast Guard Warrant Officer Mike Shoul said a federal judge will
conduct a hearing and decide by July either to revoke or suspend
Sanders' license, or dismiss the charge.
   Sanders is free and can continue to pilot vessels pending the
outcome of the hearing, Shoul said.

   A jury was sworn in Tuesday in the federal fraud
and racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos, and the judge said opening
arguments would begin next week.
   Earlier, U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan ruled that bank
records from the Philippines, Hong Kong and Singapore could be used
as evidence in the trial of the former Philippines first lady and
Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   Selection of the jury and six alternates was completed near the
end of the trial's first day. Keenan asked jurors to return to
court next Tuesday, when the trial is to resume with opening
arguments.
   The panel consists of three postal workers, two transit and two
utility employees, a retired secretary, a teacher's aide, an
engineer, a computer operator and an estate manager with a law firm.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorneys had sought to block the bank documents,
but the judge decided they were admissible because prosecutors had
filed the proper certification.
   The judge reserved a ruling on the admissibility of documents
from Italy, Switzerland and West Germany, saying he would rule
before the start of the trial's opening arguments, possibly next
week.
   Among documents allowed as evidence were 2,000 pages of records
from two trust accounts at the Standard Chartered Bank of Hong
Kong, which prosecutors alleged were controlled by Mrs. Marcos and
her husband, Ferdinand, who died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28.
   Keenan said the government will use the trust account records to
try to establish that the Marcoses owned three Panamanian companies
that in turn owned a building at 40 Wall St. in New York.
   The building is among four Manhattan properties that prosecutors
claim the Marcoses bought with more than $160 million they stole
from the Philippines' treasury.
   The Singapore bank records relate to the alleged transfer of
millions of dollars for the purchase of 40 Wall St., the judge
said. The other records found admissible were from the Traders
Royal Bank in Manila.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted,
she faces up to 50 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
   Khashoggi is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal the real
estate deals. He faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in
fines if convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Marcos, the former Philippines president, had been named in the
original October 1988 indictment. The trial is expected to last
three to four months.

<TEXT>
   Cuba protested the start of U.S. television
transmissions to the Communist island nation Tuesday as illegal and
a possible prelude to U.S. military action against Fidel Castro's
government.
   Cuban jamming limited the first test transmission of TV Marti to
10 minutes, Prensa Latina said.
   However, reports from Washington said the jamming began 23
minutes into the transmission in downtown Havana, and that viewers
in outlying areas had few problems during the five-hour test.
   ``Cuban authorities have warned that the beginning of these
transmissions may form part of a larger maneuver and Washington may
be looking for a pretext to unleash military aggression,'' the
Cuban government news agency Prensa Latina said.
   In Panama, the commander of U.S. military forces in Latin
America said the United States doesn't have to do anything to get
rid of Castro because the Cuban people will.
   ``We don't have the slightest intention of invading Castro right
now. There is no need to,'' Gen. Marc Cisneros told The Associated
Press. ``His own people are going to do to him what ...
(Panamanians) did to (deposed dictator Manuel Antonio) Noriega.''
   Cisneros was asked to comment on Castro's claim that 500,000
U.S. soldiers would die if the United States tried to invade Cuba.
   ``He's a clown,'' Cisneros said. ``Castro is smoking marijuana
on this point.''
   Prensa Latina, monitored in Mexico City, suggested that the
danger of an air wave war escalating to armed confrontation could
be behind stepped up Cuban militia drills.
   Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, the Cuban armed forces
chief of staff, said his men are ready to defend Cuba against a
U.S. invasion.
   ``We have high moral and a combative mood in our armed forces,
sufficient equipment and the will to defend our revolution and our
country,'' he said, according to Prensa Latina.
   The Foreign Ministry said the Bush administration is on a
``course ever more aggressive and hostile towards the Cuban
revolution.''
   It said the administration had been emboldened by ``the changes
in Eastern Europe, the election results in Nicaragua and a Pyrrhic
victory in Panama that massacred thousands of its sons.''
   The United States, which invaded Panama in December to oust
Noriega, must realize its actions are ``capable of provoking a
crisis of great proportions in this part of the world,'' said vice
Foreign Minister Oscar Oramas.
   The TV Marti transmission test included music, a 1971 World
Series tape and an episode of ``Kate and Allie,'' a comedy series
about two divorced women and their children.
   ``For the United States the debut was nothing impressive since
in a 10-minute interval the principal technological power on the
planet could not keep the invading signal from being rejected over
the coverage area,'' Prensa Latina said.
   It said residents called local radio stations in outrage over
the ``miserable and cowardly aggression.''
   ``The authorities base their rejection of the transmissions not
only on the subversive character of their content but on their
illegality and above all on the occupation of a locally used
frequency within the sovereignty of Cuban national territory,'' the
news agency said.
   It said Channel 13, used for the TV Marti transmission, is a
domestic channel used by Tele Rebelde.
   Prensa Latina said the transmission violates the U.N. charter,
conventions on the use of communications satellites and other
international agreements.
   It also protested use of the name of Cuban hero Jose Marti for
the transmission.
   Cuba has denounced the transmissions before the
Interparliamentary Telecommunications Union, the Non-Aligned
Movement, the U.N. Security Council and other international bodies,
the agency said.

   The shuttle mission to propel the
$1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit may be moved up a
day or two, but NASA said Tuesday that crews still face some bugs:
insects.
   The telescope is to be transferred into Discovery's payload bay
no earlier than Thursday, two days later than scheduled because of
gnat-like insects in a payload preparation room. NASA earlier gave
Wednesday as the earliest transfer time.
   Still, NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said technicians needed
little if any of the contingency time built into Discovery's
prelaunch schedule, making it possible for the agency to take the
unusual step of moving up the launch date.
   ``The processing has gone very smoothly,'' said Dick Young, a
spokesman for the agency.
   NASA occasionally has moved around shuttle launch dates on the
manifest because of scheduling changes in the months prior to
liftoff, Young said. But it is the first time liftoff has been
accelerated once orbiter processing has begun.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Flight
Readiness Review Board will finalize the launch date after meeting
Friday and Saturday at Kennedy Space Center.
   Last month, Discovery's launch date was moved from April 18 to
April 12 after the lower right segment of the shuttle's solid-fuel
rocket booster was replaced more quickly than anticipated.
   On Monday, shuttle managers determined that problems with
Discovery's nose wheel landing gear will not hamper the mission.
   The mosquito-like midges were found on the orbiter's payload bay
doors Sunday when a servicing machine was retracted to receive the
telescope.
   By late Tuesday, 37 midges had been caught in seven traps set up
in the preparation room. Technicians plan to inspect the traps
again Tuesday night and, provided no more than a few insects are
caught, proceed Wednesday with preparations for a Thursday
installation.
   ``The Hubble is so sensitive,'' Malone said. ``They've got very
strict conditions.''
   Discovery's five astronauts are to deploy the Hubble on the
second day of the five-day mission. The telescope will orbit 370
miles above Earth, looking seven times more deeply into space and
detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   The Hubble originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but was
delayed because of technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion.

   Police and Communist rebels fought a
running gun battle early Wednesday about one mile from the
presidential palace, and police said one policeman and a suspected
rebel were killed.
   In other developments:
   _The U.S. Navy banned most non-essential travel to Manila
because of threats to Americans.
   _The military said Communist rebels killed 15 troopers last
Saturday on southern Mindanao island and shot dead a Filipino
executive of the Nestle's company in an ambush Monday southeast of
Manila.
   Police Sgt. Florentino Bagallon gave this account of the
Wednesday shootout:
   At 4 a.m. police spotted about four youths painting Communist
slogans on a lane divider in Manila's Santa Mesa district.
   They gave chase and the youths lured them into a dark street
where about 12 rebel gunmen waited in ambush.
   Rebels pulled M-16 rifles from a sack and fired, killing
Constable 1st Class Roxy Valguna. Officers radioed for
reinforcements, who killed one rebel during a running gun fight
through the crowded residential district.
   Another rebel was arrested.
   The incident came on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the New
People's Army, the military wing of the outlawed Communist Party of
the Philippines.
   Police have predicted stepped up guerrilla activity in
connection with the anniversary.
   At the U.S.-run Subic Naval Base, 50 miles west of Manila, Rear
Adm. Roger Rich banned most non-essential travel to the capital by
the more than 6,000 sailors because of ``threats against U.S.
military and military associated personnel.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the order, issued
Monday, bans leaves in Manila except for servicemen with immediate
family members residing there.
   The order does not apply to personnel at Clark Air Base, 50
miles north of Manila. Air Force officials said Clark personnel
were told not to travel between the base and Manila at night.
   The military said 12 militiamen and three soldiers were killed
Saturday in the ambush of a patrol by guerrillas in Davao del Sur
province, 620 miles southeast of Manila. It said three troopers
were wounded and 11 were missing.
   Two rebels died in the 30-minute gunbattle, the report said.
   On Monday, Froilan Pablo, executive vice president of Nestle's
Philippines, was slain by four gunmen as he played tennis in
Cabuyao, 25 miles southeast of Manila. The killers escaped.
   Police said they believed the attackers belonged to a rebel
assassination squad that targeted Pablo because of labor problems
at his company.
   Col. Jose Lachica, operations chief of the National Capital
Region Defense Command, predicted more rebel attacks on business
executives.

<TEXT>
   Malev, the Hungarian airline, announced
Tuesday the indefinite suspension of flights to Beirut, less than a
week after halting flights of Soviet Jews to Israel because of
threats from Moslem extremists.
   A spokesman for the state carrier denied the decisions were
related.
   The measure came 10 days after flights to the Lebanese capital
resumed following a five-year lapse, the government news agency MTI
reported. The spokesman for the government-owned airline told MTI
the suspension was due to a lack of security in Lebanese airspace.
   MTI quoted the unidentified Malev spokesman as saying the
suspension of flights to Beirut would be in effect ``until further
notice.''
   He said it was unrelated to its move Wednesday to halt flights
of Soviet Jews to Israel, a decision Hungarian government leaders
have criticized, saying it was made by airline officials who did
not consult with the government.
   The Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine issued threats
against airlines of all those countries that provide such flights.
   Hundreds of thousands of Jews are expected to emigrate to Israel
in the next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the Soviet
Union and tighter entry quotas in the United States.
   The exodus has sparked an uproar in the Arab world, which fears
many of the newcomers could settle in the Israeli-occupied
territories, especially the West Bank.
   The Soviet airline Aeroflot does not run direct flights to
Israel. Instead, migrants must change at one of several transit
points, including Budapest.

<TEXT>
   Senior U.N. officials said Tuesday
that the millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran should
return home and begin rebuilding their war-torn nation.
   ``It is clear that somehow we've got to help feed them in 1990,
(but) this can't go on forever,'' World Food Program Executive
Director James Ingram told reporters.
   Sadruddin Aga Khan, the U.N. coordinator for humanitarian aid,
and Thorvald Stoltenberg, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees,
also attended the news conference.
   Ingram said the Afghan civil war between the Marxist government
and Moslem guerrillas ``has lasted for 10 or 11 years already and
now there is an opportunity to make progress in the return of
refugees.''
   About 3.8 million Afghans live in a maze of refugee camps
scattered along Pakistan's border. Another 2 million live in Iran.
   While insisting the refugees must go home voluntary, Sadruddin
said the United Nations hoped that rebuilding their destroyed
country might be the catalyst to spark their return.
   Most of the refugees fled after Soviet soldiers marched into
Afghanistan in 1979 to replace one Communist government with
another and to crush the Moslem insurgency.
   Moscow withdrew the last of its troops in February 1989, but
most refugees have stayed in Pakistan while the war continues
between the U.S.-backed guerrillas and the Soviet-supported
government in Kabul.
   Sadruddin has made fresh appeals for contributions toward his
$1.2 billion repatriation plan. The money is to be used to rebuild
Afghanistan, where the war has ruined the economy, wiped out herds
and farmlands and destroyed thousands of villages.
   Sadruddin has suggested the refugees return to parts of
Afghanistan where there has been little or no fighting in recent
months. These areas would be designated peace zones.
   He said renewed fighting instigated by either the Kabul
government or the guerrillas would end U.N. assistance.
   ``The price to pay will be no ... U.N. aid,'' said Sadruddin,
who returned Tuesday from a daylong trip to Kabul.
   However, Afghan and Western sources fear another round of
fighting will begin once the snow melts and weapons can be ferried
from Pakistan across the rugged mountain passes to Afghan cities.

   Halston, the designer who created the
pillbox hat that Jacqueline Kennedy made chic and whose
star-studded circle of friends included Andy Warhol and Liza
Minnelli, has died of AIDS-related cancer. He was 57.
   He died in his sleep at Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center
Monday night. His brother, Robert Frowick, said Tuesday that
Halston had suffered from AIDS for the last 18 months and died of a
related cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma.
   Halston asked his family to auction an all-black Rolls-Royce
``dream car'' he bought for more than $200,000 last year and to
donate the proceeds to AIDS research, Frowick told a news
conference at the hospital attended by his brother, Donald, and
sister, Susan Watkins.
   Halston spent some of his final days touring the California
coastline, especially Big Sur, in the Rolls-Royce, Frowick said.
   Known worldwide for his simple and sexy creations, Halston
designed clothes for such celebrities as Lauren Bacall, Minnelli
and Bianca Jagger. Bacall dubbed him ``Halstie Baby,'' and once
ordered 75 outfits priced at $200 to $1,000 each.
   Through his work he became friends with Warhol and other
celebrities, including model Marissa Berenson.
   The top-rated designer was responsible for the pillbox hat that
Mrs. Kennedy wore at her husband's presidential inauguration in
1961. The hats became popular with millions of women.
   He later pioneered the use of Ultrasuede, a synthetic fabric
much like suede.
   ``The Halston label on a dress or perfume tells a woman that
what she's buying will be recognized as `right,''' Vogue magazine
once said, ``that it's more than just stylish, it's in good taste.''
   Born Roy Halston Frowick on April 23, 1932, in Des Moines, Iowa,
he attended Indiana University and the Chicago Art Institute. Said
to have been fascinated with his grandmother's hats as a child, he
began making hats while still in college.
   His first client was Fran Allison of ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie,''
and within months he was creating hats for Kim Novak, Hedda Hopper,
Deborah Kerr and Shirley Booth.
   He moved to New York City in 1957, working in Lily Dache's hat
division. The next year, he went to work for Bergdorf Goodman
department store as a milliner, and later began designing
Bergdorf's ready-to-wear fashions. He opened his own couture house
in 1968.
   ``He was temperamental, spoiled, always threatening to quit,''
Andrew Goodman, Bergdorf's president, said in 1973. ``But we
indulged him because he was so talented.''
   Halston added a ready-to-wear range, called Halston
International, in 1970, and Halston Originals in 1972.
   But Halston's position at the pinnacle of the fashion industry
began to slip dramatically in 1973, when he signed a $16 million
deal with Norton Simon Inc. for his ready-to-wear line, his couture
operation and the Halston trademark.
   The agreement let Norton Simon use the Halston name for products
the designer didn't design, and Halston couldn't use his name on
any product without Norton Simon's permission.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. approached Norton Simon with the idea of a
line of inexpensive Halston clothes to be sold exclusively in the
moderate-price department stores, and Halston agreed. That deal was
signed in 1982.
   Shortly after that, Bergdorf Goodman announced it would no
longer sell Halston clothes because of the association with
Penney's. Adding to the designer's woes, Norton Simon was acquired
at the same time in a takeover with the Esmark Inc. conglomerate,
which in turn was taken over by the Beatrice companies.
   To cut costs, Beatrice eliminated Halston's limousines,
dismissed much of his staff and disassembled his company.
   Revlon Group Inc. in New York bought the Halston name in
December 1986. They used it on a popular fragrance line, called
simply, ``Halston.''
   ``We are all deeply saddened by Halston's death,'' said Ronald
Perelman, Revlon's chairman of the board. ``He was an American
leader of design and style who helped to define his entire era. He
will be sorely missed.''
   Halston won Coty fashion awards in 1962 and 1969, and was
elected to the fashion Hall of Fame in 1974.
   Halston had effectively retired by the fall of 1988 and was
diagnosed with the AIDS virus about a year ago, Frowick said at the
news conference. The designer moved to California in December.
   ``There really isn't much to celebrate,'' he was quoted as
saying when asked about his increasingly sedate lifestyle. ``People
are always asking, `What happened? How are you?'
   ``It can be very difficult,'' he said. ``I have no answer.''
   After he was hospitalized, his family brought him gourmet meals
approved by his doctor, his brother said. Halston enjoyed a
breathtaking view of the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay
area from his hospital room, which was filled with orchids and
other flowers.
   ``He was quite lucid up until the last few days,'' Frowick said.
`` ... When he was alert, he was extremely alert and he had very
strong mental faculties that never left him.''
   Frowick described his brother as ``an extremely elegant man ...
that's the way he tried to go through his final stages, too.''
   In a statement issued earlier in the day, Frowick said the
family ``mourns the loss of a magnificent and deeply respected
brother and friend.''
   ``We thank all those from around the world who have been
communicating thoughtful wishes to him. America has lost a true
patriot and its greatest designer, one of the greatest designers in
the world.''
   A memorial service is planned Friday at Calvary Presbyterian
Church in San Francisco. Halston's body will be cremated.

   Actor Rene Enriquez, who portrayed Lt. Ray
Calletano on the old Emmy Award-winning ``Hill Street Blues'' TV
series, has died of pancreatic cancer. He was 56.
   Enriquez died Friday at his suburban Tarzana home and his body
was cremated the following day, said his sister, Violetta Enriquez.
The actor, who wasn't married and had no children, didn't want a
funeral, she said Tuesday.
   His motion picture credits included a co-starring role with Gary
Busey in ``Bulletproof'' and a plum role as Gen. Anastasio Somoza
in ``Under Fire,'' co-starring Nick Nolte and Gene Hackman. He also
appeared with Charles Bronson in ``The Evil That Men Do.''
   James B. Sikking, who played Lt. Howard Hunter on ``Hill Street
Blues,'' learned of the actor's death while on vacation in Hawaii.
   ``I've lost a friend and a co-worker. I'm shocked. The Latin
acting community has also lost a great actor,'' said Sikking, who
now stars as the father on ABC-TV's ``Doogie Howser, M.D.''
   Enriquez boasted of his role on ``Hill Street Blues,'' viewing
his character as pivotal in the former NBC-TV series. Calletano was
the precinct's second in command.
   ``I'm proud of the show. It made a powerful statement on the
decay of cities and human isolation,'' he said.
   In one of the series' most-famous episodes, in 1982, the
normally quiet Calletano was honored as the mythical police
department's ``Hispanic Officer of the Year.''
   The character Calletano was proud and sensitive about his
Colombian heritage and unhappy about the status of Hispanics in

   At his testimonial banquet, after being misidentified as Puerto
Rican and served Mexican food, Calletano threw away his acceptance
speech and told the stunned audience: ``Why is it ... that I look

   Long before ``Hill Street Blues,'' Enriquez was a familiar face
on such television shows as ``The Defenders,'' ``The Nurses,''
``Naked City,'' ``Charlie's Angels,'' ``Benson,'' ``Quincy'' and
``WKRP in Cincinnati.''
   Born in Granada, Nicaragua, Enriquez was being groomed for the
priesthood when he decided as a teen-ager to leave the seminary and
head for the United States. His uncle, Gen. Emiliano Chamorro, was
a former president of Nicaragua.
   He attended the University of San Francisco and later switched
to San Francisco City College where he studied international
relations. He served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War
then returned to San Francisco State University.
   In 1958, he joined the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New
York.

   Well, the second act set _ a craggy mountain of
rocks made to suggest a hilltop in upstate New York _ was nice.
   But the play, ``Making Movies,'' which opened Tuesday at
off-Broadway's Promenade Theater, is a mistake _ a flat,
unconvincing comedy that stymies director Don Scardino and a cast
of usually competent actors.
   It was written by Aaron Sorkin who scored on Broadway earlier
this season with ``A Few Good Men,'' a military courtroom drama
starring Tom Hulce.
   There are similiarities between the two works. Both have
wisecracking heroes. In ``Making Movies,'' it's a screenwriter
trying to make up with his girlfriend who happens to be a producer
of the movie. She wants him to do rewrites on the script. In ``A
Few Good Men,'' it's a Navy lawyer who defends two Marines accused
of murder.
   Scardino directed both plays. He gave ``A Few Good Men'' a
crackerjack production, fast-paced and occasionally funny. But with
``Making Movies'' desperation has set in. The actors push too hard.
Intensity is the order of the day.
   And there's not too much material to get worked up about.
Besides fighting with his girlfriend, the screenwriter must contend
with the director, an old college friend, who has visions of making
a great military epic, set in Guam. Why they are filming on a farm
outside Schenectady, N.Y., is never made entirely clear.
   The dialogue tries for trendy, but ends up turgid. There are a
great many jokes in the second act about three cows who happen to
wander into the final day of shooting. Some are funny.
   ``Making Movies'' will not inspire anyone to go into the film
business. Animal husbandry, maybe. But not show business.

   Arab and non-Arab countries said Tuesday
during a Security Council session that the settlement of Soviet
Jews in the Israeli-occupied territories threatens peace in the
Middle East.
   On Wednesday, the Security Council plans to meet again to
continue discussions on the controversial issue of Soviet
emigration to the occupied lands.
   Hundreds of thousands of Jews are expected to emigrate to Israel
in the next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the Soviet
Union and tighter entry quotas in the United States.
   The exodus has sparked an uproar in the Arab world, which fears
many of the newcomers could settle in the occupied territories,
especially the West Bank. Israel says it has no policy of settling
the immigrants in the occupied territories.
   Egypt's permanent representative to the United Nations said the
international community ``is dutybound to safeguard the endeavors
for peace in the Middle East at this critical stage in the
process.''
   The representative, Amre Moussa, said Egypt believes ``that
immigration to Israel coupled with settling Israeli civilians or
immigrants in the occupied territories, constitutes a serious
threat'' to Middle East peace prospects.
   Moussa called on the United States and the Soviet Union to
``ensure that the rights of the Palestinian people shall not be
jeopardized.''
   ``We must not allow anyone to waste this unique opportunity to
achieve tangible progress toward a reconciliation between the
Jewish and Palestinian nations,'' Moussa said.
   Syrian representative Issa Awad criticized Israel and the United
States for supporting policies that he said lead to ``the herding
of these immigrants like cattle to Israel against all values''
espoused by the United States.
   Chinese Ambassador Li Luye said Jewish settlement in the
occupied lands ``aggravated the already tense situation in the
Middle East'' and posed ``new barriers to the peace process in the
region.''
   Li said China, one of five permanent members of the Security
Council, would continue to work for measures to safeguard the
rights of Palestinians.
   The 15-member Security Council originally took up the issue of
Soviet Jewish emigration to the West Bank and Gaza on March 15, but
adjourned without taking action.

   Rockets struck a residential district
of Kabul on Tuesday, killing 27 people and wounding 22, according
to a radio account monitored in the Pakistani capital.
   While no one claimed responsibility for the attack, Radio Kabul
blamed the U.S.-backed Moslem insurgents who have been fighting 12
years to topple Communist governments in Kabul.
   Most of the dead were aboard a mini-bus hit by one of several
rockets launched, the radio report said.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in rocket attacks on the
Afghan capital the past year. Afghanistan's Marxist President Najib
has accused rebel fighters, who insist they target only military
installations.
   The radio report claimed the rockets were fired from Paghman,
about 15 miles west of Kabul.

<TEXT>
   The Democratic speaker of the Wisconsin
Assembly announced his campaign for governor Tuesday at a high
school gymnasium, pledging to make education the No. 1 election
issue.
   Thomas Loftus, 44, is the only Democrat so far to throw his hat
into the gubernatorial ring.
   Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson has not formally announced his
re-election bid, but said earlier this week he was ``98 percent''
certain he would.
   Loftus, Assembly speaker since 1983, announced his candidacy at
Sun Prairie High School, where he graduated in 1963.
   He told about 500 students and faculty at Sun Prairie that the
state had fallen behind in the worldwide race to prepare students
for the future.
   ``We're not keeping pace. It's not good enough anymore to be
better than Kentucky or Mississippi _ or even to be as good as
Minnesota,'' Loftus said. ``That's not the competition anymore.
   ``When you finish high school and begin work, you will be
competing with kids from Japan and Korea and a new unified Europe.
And many of those kids will have a head start on you because they
are getting a better education,'' Loftus said.
   Thompson is seen as having early advantages in the race _ a
campaign chest of $1.4 million, a healthy state economy and
widespread popularity in several public opinion polls.
   Loftus dismissed those advantages. ``It's not Election Day. The
governor is on the wrong side of education, property taxes, Indian
treaty rights, abortion and welfare,'' he said Tuesday.
   A backer of abortion rights, Loftus said the issue would be key
in the campaign, adding that he would portray Thompson's
anti-abortion stand as ``out of step with the people of this
state.''

   Acid-tongued clothes critic Mr. Blackwell
ripped into celebrity Oscar get-ups Tuesday with a worst-dressed
list led by Jane Fonda's ``Vegas viking'' look and Kim Basinger's
``catastrophe in white.''
   Blackwell also heaped disdain on Julia Roberts' ``bumpy, buxom
band-aid of a dress'' and called Brenda Fricker's ``tacky tunic top
and baggy black pants an Irish atrocity.''
   The acerbic fashion designer, whose real name is Richard Sylvan
Selzer, has lambasted celebrity garb for 30 years with his annual
worst-dressed roll call.
   Fitness guru Miss Fonda, who was escorted by cable television
mogul Ted Turner, caught his eye Monday night. ``The return of the
Vegas Viking ... sequined breastplate effect was over-colorized and
overdone.''
   About Miss Basinger's attire, he said: ``Scarlett O'Hara meets
Miss Majorette in a monstrously misguided fashion flop. A
catastrophe in white.''
   Blackwell, who has designed dresses for Marilyn Monroe and Zsa
Zsa Gabor in the past, said the return of red made big fashion news
at Monday night's 62nd annual Academy Awards. He even took time to
praise a celebrity trio.
   ``In a toned down, downright understated ceremony, the
predominant fashion focus was on the arrival of the red queens _
Geena Davis, Anjelica Huston and Elizabeth McGovern,'' Blackwell
drooled, adding they were ``elegant, regal and arresting.''
   Also receiving high marks were Diana Ross, ``a vision in white
crepe;'' Candice Bergen, ``a dreamy confection in a cloud of pink
beads;'' and Michelle Pfeiffer, ``demure without being dowdy,
simple without being boring.''
   But there was mostly Blackwell venom.
   Also getting pans were: Melissa Manchester, ``an escapee from a
vampire video;'' Glenn Close, ``black funeral frock ... perfect for
a guillotine gathering;'' Daryl Hannah, ``splash trash at its webby
worst;'' Dianne Wiest, ``high priestess from a `Star Trek' rerun;''
Pauline Collins, ``looks like she wore her chenille bedspread;''
and Sally Kirkland, ``still the queen of cartoon couture.''

   Guatemalan government and guerrilla
representatives met Tuesday to renew talks on ending the Central
American nation's 28-year-old civil war.
   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, an umbrella for
guerrilla groups, held its first talks in a year with the
government-backed National Reconciliation Commission under the
auspices of the World Federation of Lutheran Churches.
   The guerrillas have been fighting a succession of
military-backed governments. Human rights groups estimate 100,000
people have died and 40,000 have disappeared during the war.
   Both sides expressed optimism but said another collapse in
negotiations could leave the conflict more severely deadlocked.
   Speaking through translators at a news conference, the
delegations declined to answer questions or state their opening
positions. Statements may be issued as early as Wednesday, but
talks may continue until Sunday.
   Little progress was made when the guerrillas met government
representatives in Madrid, Spain, in 1986. A round of talks in
Costa Rica broke down last year.
   Jorge E. Rosal Melendez of the three-member guerrilla delegation
said the Oslo meeting was an effort to ``open the door to a process
that is bound to be complex and difficult, but not impossible, in
search of a final solution.''
   Speaking for the three commissioners, Jorge Serrano Elias said
he found broad support for a peace initiative among the government,
the military, private individuals and opposition parties.
   ``The feeling of the Guatemalan people ... is that peace must be
achieved so that we can put a final stop this conflict,'' he said.
``We also realize that if this meeting fails the consequences would
be grave,'' Elias said.
   The Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity is the umbrella for
three guerrilla groups, the Rebel Armed Forces, Guerrilla Army of
the Poor and the Organization of the People in Arms. U.S. estimates
put its number of fighters at 1,500.

   Governors horned in on U.S. foreign policy
when they tried to stop state National Guard units from training in
Central America, the Bush administration told the Supreme Court on
Tuesday.
   Solicitor General Kenneth Starr asked the court to squelch
Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich's challenge of a 1986 law that strips
all governors of their veto power over National Guard training
missions.
   ``What the governor has sought to do is to play a role in the
foreign policy and defense policy of the United States,'' said
Starr, the Justice Department's highest-ranking courtroom lawyer.
   The case has revived a controversy from the 1988 presidential
campaign in which Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis denounced
the Reagan administration for what he called a ``failed and
illegal'' policy of supporting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   The Massachusetts governor said that sending National Guard
troops to the region was an attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   Dukakis unsuccessfully challenged the same 1986 law, a lawsuit
government lawyers called ``a dagger aimed at the heart of national
defense.''
   Perpich alleges in his lawsuit against the Defense Department
that the Constitution gives states the authority to direct or
consent to peacetime training of state militia.
   Rather than attack U.S. policy in Central America, Perpich has
portrayed the dispute as a states' rights fight.
   A Supreme Court decision is expected by July.
   John Tunheim, chief deputy attorney general for Minnesota,
argued Tuesday that the founding fathers created state militia
because they ``greatly feared the effect of a large standing army.''
   ``They believed that state control would be a very important
check on the federal government,'' Tunheim said.
   But Justice Anthony Kennedy asked how the federal government
could properly prepare National Guard units for battle without
having the unfettered authority to decide where they are trained.
   In Minnesota's view, Kennedy said, ``We're in a position where
we can't train them to do some of the things we're calling them
forth to do.''
   The 1986 law, known as the Montgomery Amendment, barred any
governor from stopping a National Guard unit from serving on active
duty outside the country over disagreement with the mission's
location, purpose or schedule.
   Named for Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, the Mississippi
Democrat who sponsored it, the law was enacted after several
governors said they opposed the Reagan administration's Central
American policy.
   Ruling on Minnesota's challenge, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the law in June.
   Urging the justices to do the same, Starr noted that National
Guard troops are enlisted in the U.S. armed forces as well as in a
state organization. Therefore, he said, the president may order
them to train anywhere he sees fit.
   ``They wear two hats,'' Starr said. ``When they were going to
Honduras they were wearing their federal hat.''
   The National Guard has been under dual state and federal control
since Congress made it a component of the Army in 1933. Enlistees
enroll simultaneously in the state militia and a reserve unit of
the U.S. armed forces.
   The dual-enlistment system ``worked very well until governors
decided to play a role on the stage of foreign policy,'' Starr said.
   Twenty-nine states filed a brief siding with the federal
government and saying that Perpich was ``seeking to arrogate to
himself a role in foreign affairs.''
   Six other states _ Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, Ohio and
Vermont _ took Minnesota's side, arguing that the Constitution
grants state control of the militia to prevent abuses by the
federal government.
   Montana later withdrew its support of Minnesota, said Gary
Blair, adjutant general of the Montana National Guard, on Tuesday.
   The Army National Guard provides 46 percent of the Army's combat
units and 28 percent of its support forces.
   The Air National Guard provides 73 percent of the nation's
interceptor forces, 25 percent of the tactical fighter aircraft and
24 percent of tactical air support.

<HEAD>Burma's Leader Defends Mass Resettlement Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Saw Maung, Burma's military ruler, on
Tuesday dismissed criticism of his government's mass resettlement
program and charges of official corruption in the drug trade.
   In a statement received in Bangkok, Thailand, Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., compared the resettlement policy to that
of the former Pol Pot government in Cambodia, which forced millions
of urban residents out into the countryside.
   The State Department last week also criticized the relocations.
   Saw Maung accused foreign news organizations of interfering in
Burma's internal affairs by publicizing critical reports.
   ``I hereby categorically deny all these groundless accusations
as totally false,'' he said.
   In a speech during the annual armed forces day in Rangoon, he
also attacked foreign media reports about the arrest and
suppression of opposition groups.
   Western diplomats in Rangoon have been quoted by foreign news
media as saying the Saw Maung government has moved up to 500,000
people from cities to outlying areas to break up regions of
political dissent.
   Saw Maung said the program was designed to give land to homeless
Burmese who were living on religious land, cemeteries and rubbish
dumps.
   Diplomats insisted that it was aimed at preventing a repeat of
huge anti-government protests in 1988, which the military harshly
suppressed when it seized power that September.
   Saw Maung attacked what he said was a March 10 Voice of America
broadcast reporting that the flow of narcotics from Burma was out
of control because of corruption among Burmese, Thai and Laotian
officials.
   In Bangkok, Melvin Levitsky, a U.S. assistant secretary of
state, on Monday accused the Burmese government of conspiring with
drug traffickers and doing little to stem record outflows of heroin.
   Moynihan's statement denounced Thailand for ``profiting from the
desperation of the Burmese regime.'' The senator quoted a New York
Times editorial Sunday that asked Thailand to ``condition its
commerce with Burma on elementary standards of conduct.''
   Thailand is one of the few countries to establish close
relations with Saw Maung's government. It since has secured
valuable logging, mining and fishing concessions.

<TEXT>
   A man who was in a vegetative state for
eight years unexpectedly ``woke up and started talking'' after
being given a tranquilizer for routine dental work, a neurologist
said Tuesday.
   ``I have to tell you he was a different man. He knew his name,
the name of his family, where he used to work. He could add,
subtract and perform complicated calculations,'' Dr. Andres Kanner
said in an interview.
   The man, identified only as a Wisconsin man in his mid-40s,
revived after being given Valium at the University of Wisconsin
Hospital and Clinics on March 12, Kanner said.
   The man, who was injured in a traffic accident 10 years ago, was
not in a coma, but a vegetative state, meaning his eyes were open
and he occasionally uttered words, but could do nothing else, the
doctor said.
   After the tranquilizer was administered for the March 12 dental
work, the man fell asleep for about five minutes, Kanner said.
   ``Then he woke up and started talking. He was able to answer
question, say his name, to feed himself and walk,'' he said.
   Hours later, the man lapsed back into the vegetative state. He
was given a second dose that brought him out of it for about 90
minutes. At that point he was able to do calculations and recall
aspects of his life.
   The man, who remains hospitalized, has since received different,
longer-lasting forms of benzodiazepines, a family of drugs that
includes Valium, and barbiturates that allowed him to remain lucid
10 to 12 hours at a time.
   Kanner said the main problem doctors face now is trying to find
a combination of drugs the man can take orally rather than
intravenously that will prevent a relapse into the vegetative state.
   The traffic accident put the man into a coma that lasted four
months, Kanner said. Soon after he recovered, his condition began
to deteriorate, leaving him in the vegetative state two years after
the wreck.
   The neurologist said that, as with most such patients, there was
little known about how to treat the man's condition and little hope
for recovery before March 12.
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Kanner said. ``It was just luck he
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered
the drugs.''
   He said the man's case must be viewed as isolated until doctors
have more time to study why benzodiazepines and particularly
barbituates have the effect they do.

   Legislation establishing the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law reached Gov. Cecil Andrus' desk
Tuesday, and both camps in the abortion battle pumped up the
pressure for him to sign or veto the bill.
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said in Washington that she would urge the group's national
conference in June to launch a nationwide boycott of all Idaho
products if the anti-abortion Democrat signs the bill.
   ``We're becoming concerned,'' said state Commerce Director James
Hawkins.
   But Allen Wildmon, associate director of the Tupelo, Miss.-based
conservative American Family Association, pledged that his members
would buy more Idaho products to counter any boycott.
   The governor has until next Monday morning to act unless the
Legislature adjourns before then. If that happens, as is expected,
Andrus has 10 days from the time lawmakers leave.
   Both camps in the abortion battle flooded Andrus' office with
telephone calls, letters and messages, and the governor met with a
pro-choice Michigan state legislative candidate to discuss the
issue.
   The candidate, Republican Gwen Dempsey, said she wanted to make
Andrus aware of the economic risk he would be taking if he signed
the bill.
   ``There's been a tremendous amount of it, people from outside
the state getting involved,'' Andrus said after a 20-minute meeting
with Dempsey. ``We in Idaho are perfectly capable of making our own
decisions.''
   He acknowledged earlier that threats of a boycott of the state's
leading cash crop, potatoes, could not be ignored, but insisted
they wouldn't affect his decision.
   The president of the National Abortion Rights Action League
joined Andrus in questioning the value of the outside interference.
   ``The governor has to make a very important decision that
affects the life and health of women, and I'm not sure threats like
that help us help him make his decision,'' said Kate Michelman,
whose group is campaigning for a veto.
   Andrus has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape,
incest and to save the life of the woman, but hasn't said whether
he'll sign the bill.
   The legislation forbids abortion as a form of birth control. It
would ban abortion except in cases involving a threat to the
woman's life or physical health; severe fetal deformity; incest if
the victim is under 18, and nonstatutory rape reported within seven
days.
   The bill, based on a National Right to Life Committee model
rejected by other states as too restrictive, carries civil
penalties against doctors performing illegal abortions.
   Abortion rights advocates maintain the bill is
unconstitutionally restrictive, and have promised an immediate
legal challenge should it become law. That would give anti-abortion
forces the court test they want of the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.

<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jim Mattox on
Tuesday again raised the question of whether his rival, Ann
Richards, has used illegal drugs, and said that's one reason she's
ducking debates before their April 10 runoff.
   ``There is sufficient information to cause me to believe that
she needs to come forward and discuss these issues in a public
forum,'' Mattox told a news conference.
   Mattox refused to provide any evidence of his allegations, but
said, ``She doesn't want to answer simple `yes or no' questions
about cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogens. She must answer what
she used, how much, for how long, and who supplied them.''
   Ms. Richards, 56, had little to say about Mattox's allegation
during a campaign appearance in McAllen. Asked by The Associated
Press if she wanted to respond to him, she replied, ``No.''
   Ms. Richards has repeatedly refused to give a yes-or-no answer
when asked if she ever used illegal drugs. A recovering alcoholic,
Ms. Richards has said she hasn't used a ``mood-altering chemical''
in 10 years and that she never knowingly committed a felony.
   ``This campaign has taken on the predictable form that Jim
Mattox campaigns always take,'' Ms. Richards said Tuesday.
``Whatever trash he can throw to try to detract from his poor
performance he will do that, and I expect it to continue until
election day.''
   Mattox, the state attorney general, said Ms. Richards is
refusing to debate him because she doesn't want to face the drug
issue and questions about her personal finances.
   He said she refuses to participate in two televised debates
proposed for Dallas and Houston. He challenged her to participate
in those and two more debates before the state Capitol press corps
in Austin.
   ``I will appear anytime, anywhere,'' Mattox told news reporters.
``Ann Richards is off on the run. She's hiding.''
   In McAllen, Ms. Richards said she was willing to debate and
blamed any failure to schedule one so far on her campaign staff.
   Ms. Richards said she didn't fear a one-on-one format: ``I spend
most of my time answering his ridiculous questions anyway.''
   But Mattox said his opponent was deliberately dodging events
other than carefully planned campaign appearances. He said such
tactics would fail against Republican nominee Clayton Williams if
Ms. Richards wins the Democratic nomination.
   In another gubernatorial campaign development, first lady
Barbara Bush, in Austin to be inducted into the Texas Women's Hall
of Fame, said she is proud Williams apologized for an off-the-cuff
remark he made over the weekend.
   At a cattle roundup, Williams compared the cold, wet weather
delaying the day's event to rape, saying, ``If it's inevitable,
just relax and enjoy it.'' The Williams campaign issued a statement
Sunday saying the remark was ``insensitive and had no place at the
campfire or in any setting.''
   Mrs. Bush said Williams is ``quite a person to speak up
immediately and apologize and say he made a mistake.''

   The Sandinista government and
negotiators for President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro reached
a preliminary agreement Tuesday for a transfer of power on April 25.
   The ``procedural protocol'' calls demobilization of the
U.S.-backed Contra rebels ``an essential element'' for handing over
the government.
   It says the new government will have control of the leftist
Sandinista army and police and that only these institutions should
have combat weapons.
   The document also says the conservative Chamorro government will
respect the rights of thousands of people given confiscated land
and homes during a decade of revolutionary Sandinista rule.
   The Sandinistas have been handing out thousand of weapons to
civilians since their Feb. 25 election defeat and have been urging
people to defend the ``conquests of the revolution.''
   They also have indicated an unwillingness to turn over control
of the armed forces and police as long as the Contras remain an
armed force.
   The protocol says the army and the police will be non-partisan
organizations.
   The accord was announced late Tuesday by the leaders of the
transition teams _ Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Ortega of the
Sandinistas and Antonio Lacayo of Mrs. Chamorro's United National
Opposition coalition, or UNO.
   Lacayo said the agreement envisions the demobilization of the
Contras by the time Mrs. Chamorro takes office April 25, as called
for in an agreement reached Friday in Honduras between UNO and the
rebels.
   Helicopters of a U.N. observer force meanwhile began flying over
Nicaraguan war zones Tuesday in preparation for the Contra
demobilization.
   Twelve white helicopters emblazoned with the U.N. symbol landed
at Sandinista army installations Tuesday morning and two hours
later took off to the east.
   Military sources said the aircraft carried members of the
observer force to eastern jungle zones, where they will try to
contact Contra chiefs.
   Under an agreement reached Friday, rebels in Honduran base camps
are to disband and return to Nicaragua by April 20. Rebels in
Nicaragua are to move into security zones under the supervision of
the U.N. force and Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   The State Department on Monday said the force should be
increased from the 200-member level agreed to last year by five
Central American presidents. That agreement was when its task was
only to monitor the Nicaraguan-Honduran border.
   The UN Security Council on Tuesday approved adding another 800
troops to the force.
   It was not known how many members of the force were in Nicaragua
on Tuesday.
   Fighting has intensified since the signing of the accord Friday,
according to the government. A Contra leader on Monday denied the
reports of combat.
   The government proposed that the security zones in which rebels
are to be moved before they demobilize be small. It also said the
zones should not be in remote regions, and that there should not be
many of them, the newspaper Barricada said.
   It said the assistant defense minister, Maj. Gen. Joaquin Cuadra
Lacayo, made the suggestions to Gen. Agustin Quesada Gomez of
Spain, chief of the U.N. force.
   Quesada Gomez arrived Monday after being called urgently by the
Sandinista government and was expected to travel to Honduras to
show the government proposals to the Contras there on Wednesday.
   Rebel commander Oscar Sovalbarro said the Contras are willing to
move to security zones, but only temporarily, until the
demobilization and disarmament process is completed.
   International observers and reporters said this week the rebel
camps in Honduras are nearly vacant, indicating most of the
estimated 12,000 fighters have infiltrated back into Nicaragua.
   Sovalbarro, the Contra negotiator in the accord, said Monday
that 2,000 rebel fighters had returned since Friday. They joined an
estimated 4,000 who were believed to have returned between
September and the Feb. 25 election.
   According to Barricada, the Sandinistas proposed that the zones
have the infrastructure to make them easily accessible for the U.N.
force and the cardinal.
   Although the agreement specifies no date for completion of the
demobilization of forces in Nicaragua, Cuadra insisted it be
simultaneous with the dismantling in Honduras.

   The U.S. Department of Energy should have
known that hydrogen gas building up in nuclear waste storage tanks
was potentially explosive, a former Nuclear Regulatory Commission
worker said Tuesday.
   Energy Department officials said at a meeting with state
regulators that they became aware only in the past two months of
the explosion potential at the Hanford nuclear reservation.
   However, they said they were aware as early as 1977 there was
gas in the huge tanks because the waste level was rising.
   ``In the late 70s and early 80s you first saw a rise, and you
knew nitrous oxide and hydrogen were in there, and there was no
question of flammability?'' said Bob Cook, a former NRC
representative at Hanford and now member of a citizens' panel
looking into the explosive tank issue.
   ``It's incredible for me to believe when there is a 22 percent
hydrogen gas volume in the experiments, and that was not considered
an explosive mixture,'' he said.
   Energy Department officials said they unsuccessfully began
trying to remove the gas in 1984.
   Don Wodrich, a Westinghouse Hanford Co. scientist studying the
tanks, said past concerns and action focused only on hydrogen in
air spaces between the waste level and the roof of the tanks, and
not on hydrogen trapped in air bubbles within the waste itself.
   The combination of hydrogen with nitrous oxide and other
decomposing organics trapped under the hard crust formed at the top
of the wastes created the new explosion threat, he said. That was
discovered only in late February, Wodrich said.
   State regulators said they were satisfied with the steps DOE had
taken to solve the problem so far, and agreed that the risk of
explosion appeared low.
   ``But even a low risk is an unacceptable risk,'' said Al Conklin
of the state Office of Radiation Protection.
   ``I don't think people should start running away from Hanford.
The problem is not that serious,'' Conklin said. ``But I will not
tell people we don't have a hazard.''
   The issue became public last Friday when Hanford manager Mike
Lawrence announced that new findings indicated that hydrogen was
building up inside up to 20 of Hanford's 169 storage tanks. He said
there was a low risk of the hydrogen catching fire or exploding.

   The Academy Awards celebrated movies low in
budget but rich in talent as ``Driving Miss Daisy'' took the Oscar
for best picture and actress, while ``My Left Foot'' won for best
actor and supporting actress.
   Jessica Tandy, who played the combative Southern widow who'd
rather walk in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' became the oldest performer
to win an Oscar at age 80.
   A surprised Miss Tandy wondered aloud why the producers cast an
actress whose career has mostly been on stage to play a lead in a
movie.
   ``I think I'm very lucky they trusted me with such a wonderful
part,'' she said backstage at the Los Angeles Music Center. ``I

ward today after allegedly telling police he set the blaze because
``the devil got into me.''
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was taken Monday from a city jail to Kings
County Hospital after allegedly confessing to setting the fire
Sunday that killed 87 people at the jammed Happy Land Social Club,
an illegal Bronx nightspot.
   Police said Gonzalez, accused of the biggest mass murder in the
continental United States, was remorseful and in tears when
questioned about the fire.
   District Attorney Robert Johnson is investigating the building's

   The government is examining $328,000 in
political donations by the chairman of a failed Florida thrift,
while a top regulator says the institution's failure could rival
the $2.5 billion collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   A ``fraud squad'' of federal examiners is investigating the
legality of contributions from CenTrust Savings Bank Chairman David
L. Paul to state and national politicians, said L. William Seidman,
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution
Trust Corp.
   The propriety of meetings between Paul and politicians and

evidence of wrongdoing will be given to the Justice Department, he
said.
   Seidman, in testimony to the House Banking Committee, said the
failure of Miami-based CenTrust, Florida's largest S&amp;L, will cost
taxpayers ``probably in excess of $2 billion.''

   With the ink barely dry on a Contra
promise to disband by mid-April, U.S.-backed rebels have streamed
into Nicaragua and their military leader says they won't disarm
until the Sandinista army does.
   ``We are speaking of total demobilization _ that includes both
ourselves and the Sandinistas,'' rebel military chief, Israel
Galeano, said Monday.
   International observers said there appeared a split among the
Contras over the pact signed Friday in Honduras. Rebel loyalty
seemed divided between Oscar Sovalbarro, a commander who signed the
agreement, and Galeano, who did not.
   The Sandinistas, defeated at the polls last month, have said
they won't hand over control of the army and police to the new
government headed by Violeta Chamorro until the U.S.-backed rebels
turn in their weapons.

   U.S. Capitol police officials cope with
terrorist threats, tourists and foreign leaders, but their toughest
current challenge may be allegations of racism aired by their own
black officers.
   The accusations have left the police force racially polarized.
Black officers have accused top commanders, all white, of
discrimination. The police brass has denied the allegations, and
white officers have backed their superiors.
   Blacks brought their grievances to a House hearing last week,
appearing in such large numbers that a police security detail
normally would have been assigned to crowd control.
   This time it wasn't necessary, because the orderly spectators _
and key witnesses _ at the House Administration subcommittee
hearing were the police.

   Moeun Mali massaged the bandaged
stump, all that's left of a leg blown off by a mine while she
walked with friends in the countryside. She awaits an ugly
replacement made of wood, leather and steel.
   She is 19 and frightened. ``I feel lost now,'' she said
softly.``I don't know about the future.''
   ``Someone like her has a bleak future in Cambodia,'' a Western
aid official said later. ``Nobody will marry her and society offers
little. There is still a cultural belief that if you have lost a
limb you are less than whole. You are a second-class citizen.''
   Moeun Mali is one of thousands of Cambodians maimed by
anti-personnel mines, which Cambodian officials and Western aid
workers say Khmer Rouge and other guerrillas are sowing in roads,
ox-cart trails, stream beds and rice fields.
   Although most of the fighting is along the Thai border in the
northeast, they say, the mines are being planted throughout the
country.
   ``In many respects, this is a war being fought with land mines
against civilians, and I don't think anybody is keeping records of
where they are being laid,'' said Brett Ballard of the American
Friends Service Committee.
   Officials of the Vietnam-sponsored government in Phnom Penh say
most of the mines are planted by the Khmer Rouge, whose government
was ousted by the Vietnamese invasion of December 1978.
   The Khmer Rouge and two less powerful guerrilla groups, which
officials say are planting a smaller number of mines, are loosely
allied against the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen.
   Aid workers said half a dozen types of mines are used.
   One made by China, the guerrillas' main arms supplier, is a blue
plastic device that floats just beneath the water's surface and is
easily detonated.
   The mines are light, making them ideal for transport from
guerrilla sanctuaries on the fromtier with Thailand, and often are
planted in flooded rice paddies. The plastic shards are difficult
to detect by X-ray when embedded in a human body.
   ``It's a classic Khmer Rouge terror tactic,'' said Ballard, who
runs his organization's aid program in Cambodia. ``They don't have
the people's hearts and minds, so they use the barrel of the gun.''
   According to Cambodian officials, the guerrillas' objectives are
to sabotage the economy, disrupt community life and convince the
people the government cannot protect them. The guerrillas also
appear to use mines to ring hideouts and arms caches.
   Both sides in the civil war sow large numbers of mines in the
northwestern battle zone, and often do not remove the mines when
they change position.
   Refugee camps and hospitals on the Thai side of the border
receive a constant stream of victims. Former soldiers with missing
limbs beg in the streets of Phnom Penh.
   Some say the greatest impact of the mine warfare is
psychological, keeping people on the edge of fear after 20 years of
war and a reign of terror by the Khmer Rouge government.
   ``It also seems to have the effect of reminding people of the
horror experienced under Pol Pot, and in many ways strengthens
resolve against the Khmer Rouge,'' Ballard said in an interview.
``People can see very clearly that the Khmer Rouge have not
changed.''
   At least 1 million people were killed or died of starvation
while Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge government was in power from April 1975
until the Vietnamese invaded.
   Conservative estimates put the number of amputees in Cambodia at
more than 10,000. Many people are killed outright or die on the way
to hospitals, which can be several days' travel from remote
villages.
   Twelve provincial centers and one in Phnom Penh, run by the
government and aided by the American Friends Service Committee
since 1982, try to cope with the mounting toll.
   Other foreign agencies are setting up vocational training for
amputees and otherwise trying to strengthen weak government
services for the handicapped.
   As in Vietnam and Laos, where people still are maimed by mines
left over from a war that ended 15 years ago, aid agencies foresee
death and injury continuing years after the conflict in Cambodia is
over.
   More than 1,800 civilians and soldiers have been fitted with
artificial legs and undergone rehabilitation at the Phnom Penh
center. Artificial arms come from abroad.
   The leg made at the center is ugly, but is relatively easy to
make from local resources and requires little maintenance. It is
sturdy, designed for farmers working in rice paddies.
   One was being made in the workshop for Moeun Mali, who lost her
right leg in December. Her father, a farmer, was killed earlier by
the Khmer Rouge.
   Moeun Mali brought her books to the center. She hopes to finish
high school and become a nurse.

<TEXT>
   Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. Court is now in
session. ``Equal Justice,'' which some call ABC's answer to NBC`s
``L.A. Law,'' begins its regular season run tonight after its
two-hour premiere Tuesday.
   If tonight's episode is any example, ``Justice,'' a large-cast
effort set in a big-city district attorney's office, had best plead
nolo contendere, or no contest, as they say in lawyerland.
   What we have here could be called ``jurysomething.'' Not only
does it lack big-city grittiness, it also seems written with one
eye on Fox Broadcasting's youth-appeal series and the other eye on
the first eye.
   In the good old days, the district attorney's office had a few
grizzled, rumpled barristers. Here, most everyone is young and
attractive. One player, James Wilder, looks like Johnny Depp in a
fashionably baggy suit.
   True, Joe Morton, as the only black on the preppy-filled staff,
also is a fine actor. But not even he can overcome a tangled script
that appears written by parties who learned about criminal law by
watching TV shows about it.
   One of two main cases afoot tonight has Morton trying to
convince residents of a black housing project that they will get
justice and protection from crime. But, of course, a very
attractive resident there doubts him.
   They clash, of course, and there is the whiff of potential
romance, of course, as he does his best to jail a mugger who
savagely beat an old woman for her welfare check.
   Problem is, another assistant district attorney needs the
mugger's testimony in a murder case. A deal must be struck, one
that would temporarily free the mugger. Complications and
frustrations ensue, as does an unbelieveable scene in which justice
is done.
   On the lighter side, there is the young assistant D.A. (Wilder)
prosecuting a former porn queen who has defrauded a group of
dentists, at $50,000 per defraud, in a bogus land deal.
   One testifies that she also once was a patient of his. She had a
small overbite, but nothing serious, he says. ``She did, however,''
he says, ``express to me her concern about her ability to
masticate.''
   Ever get the feeling some TV scriptwriters did not major in
snappy?
   Amid all this, the other young prosecutors bustle about, awash
in satchels, court papers, one-liners and concern.
   A handsome young public defender also briefly checks in, causing
the lovely rookie, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, to approvingly
murmur, ``Nice.''
   But she is awfully harried. Not only is she trying to get time
to fly home for her father's 50th birthday, she has such a heavy
caseload she runs from courtroom to courtroom.
   When forced to fill in for an injured colleague at a complicated
grand jury hearing, she is so inexperienced she drops her court
papers before the hearing begins. Boy, that's inexperienced.
   But she is spunky. In bad scripts, spunky always wins.
   However, it seems a safe bet that the Nielsen jury will soon
declare ``Equal Justice'' guilty of bad show, a crime punishable by
imprisonment at CBS as a replacement for ``The Pat Sajak Show.''

   DAN SITS DOWN: ``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather, who made
tiny headlines last September as the only network anchor to stand
and deliver the news each weeknight, re-joined the ranks of seated
anchorfolks Monday.
   A spokeswoman for his broadcast said she didn't know if it would

was seated when the ratings for last week arrived.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won again, averaging a 10.5 rating,
followed by the ``NBC Nightly News,'' which had a 9.4. Rather's
program, third for most of this year, was third again, with an 8.9
average.
   And, says an ABC spokesman, ``World News'' won the first quarter
of this year for the first time in its history, averaging an 11.3
rating to the 10.2 of NBC's newscast and the 10.1 of Rather's
once-dominant broadcast.
   Each ratings point currently represents 921,000 homes.

<TEXT>
   Peter Brazaitis held up what looked like two
alligator handbags, one green and supple, the other a tawny brown,
cracked and peeling.
   The green bag was indeed alligator. The inferior brown bag was
made from an endangered species of caiman, a South American reptile
whose skin has bony plates that cannot be softened by tanning.
   ``Both of these sell for $600 to $800,'' said Brazaitis, a
herpetologist and curator of animals at New York City's Central
Park Zoo. ``Caiman skin breaks, so when the public buys an
endangered skin, they're getting ripped off.''
   Indeed, unwary consumers lose twice: they pay handsome prices
for inferior products and their purchases reduce the numbers of an
endangered species.
   Trade in so-called exotic leathers made from reptile skins is
threatening the survival of the world's 23 species of crocodilians,
19 of which are threatened or endangered. Crocodilians include
alligators, crocodiles and gavials.
   Some reptile skins are legal. Among them are the skins of
American alligators, which make high-quality leather and are sold
for $350 each. About 375,000 skins were obtained from legal sources
last year, Brazaitis said.
   ``But if you look at how many skins are estimated to be in
trade, it's 2 million a year,'' he said. ``Two-thirds of the trade
is either from an endangered species or an illegal source.''
   Illegal skins, which may earn their trappers a mere $5 to $10
apiece, are ``laundered'' by mixing them with legal skins before
they reach tanneries, Brazaitis said.
   Trade in illegal skins is not confined to Asian bazaars or
remote tropical outposts. Top department stores and the exclusive
boutiques on Manhattan's East Side sell products made of such
endangered species as the yacare caiman of Central and South
America.
   ``I've just done a circuit of all the major stores surrounding
the zoo here, and I've found products from yacare caiman,''
Brazaitis said. A prestigious name on the door is no guarantee of
the quality of the reptile skin products inside, he said.
   As Brazaitis's survey suggests, trade in illegal skins is
flourishing. It is widespread in the United States, despite tight
safeguards established by the United Nations and by Congress, under
the U.S. Endangered Species Act.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates 2,000 to 3,000
shipments, each containing up to several thousand reptile skins,
enter the port of New York each month.
   They include skins from boa constrictors, Nile crocodiles,
African monitor lizards, Siamese crocodiles, anacondas and Indian
rock pythons, all shaped into handbags, belts, shoes and
briefcases. Many carry the names of world-famous designers and
prestigious retailers.
   Only experts like Brazaitis can tell the legal skins from the
illegal.
   ``When you get to the department store, they don't care,'' said
Brazaitis. ``They don't know.'' Nevertheless, sales clerks
confidently assure customers that everything the store sells is
made from legal skins, Brazaitis said.
   The skins of more than 350 animals confiscated in New York by
the Fish and Wildlife Service are on display at the Central Park
Zoo in an exhibit titled ``The Illegal Skin Trade.''
   The exhibit includes a U.S. Customs declaration form attesting
to the legality of a wildlife shipment of royal pythons and boa
constrictors from Africa. Brazaitis chuckled as he pointed it out.
``Royal pythons come from Asia, and boa constrictors come from
South America,'' he said.
   Most people find reptiles about as welcome as a boa
constrictor's embrace. ``People say, `What do you want to save
those things for? They eat people,''' Brazaitis said.
   But their disappearance leads to the loss of tropical
wilderness, a problem receiving increasing attention as Americans
prepare for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Earth Day on
April 22.
   Crocodilians are predators at the top of the food chain,
Brazaitis explained. They regulate the population of other species.
   An experiment to remove aggressive, fearsome Nile crocodiles
from a lake in Egypt showed how balances can tip, he said. ``The
fish that people couldn't eat _ the garbage fish _ proliferated.
The fish people could eat couldn't compete. They declined.''
   Caimans eat snails that carry the parasitic disease
schistosomiasis, deadly to humans. With fewer caimans, outbreaks of
the disease could be more common, Brazaitis suggested.
   The concern about trade in reptile skins has echoes of the
anti-fur movement, but the situations are not the same.
   Opponents of fur are concerned largely about the welfare of the
animals that are killed and skinned for their fur. Trade in fur
from endangered species has largely been stopped, wildlife
officials say.
   Trade in reptile skins, on the other hand, is seriously
aggravating threats to many of the world's endangered reptiles,
Brazaitis said. It is an environmental issue more than an animal
welfare issue.
   Brazaitis would like to see it become a consumer issue.
   ``If you elect to buy the caiman product, it's not going to
last,'' he said.
   So how do customers avoid getting swindled? They can hire a
herpetologist, or refuse to buy exotic leather.
   ``We would prefer that people do not buy exotic leathers,'' said

<TEXT>
   For nearly 2,000 years, pilgrims
have followed the footsteps of Moses up, up, up the mystic mountain
of the Ten Commandments.
   As tourists outnumber pilgrims more and more, Egyptian officials
have a plan to let climbers bypass many of the 3,750 stone steps to
Mount Sinai's summit laid by centuries of monks.
   A cable car, they say, would make for a quicker and easier trip
up the mountain, which is sacred to Jews, Christians and Moslems.
   Officials of the government's Misr Sinai Tourist Co. believe
such an attraction will help increase tourism and provide Egypt's
hungry economy with much-needed dollars. Opponents object on
religious, spiritual, historical and environmental grounds.
   ``This is a holy place. It belongs to the world,'' said Greek
Orthodox Archbishop Damianos, head of the Monastery of St.
Catherine, which has stood at the mountain's base for 1,400 years.
   Abdel Azim A. Bassiouni, Misr Sinai's chairman and chief
advocate of the cable car, replied: ``We Egyptians are very
religious. It's unrealistic to think that technology has no place
in sacred places. We cannot bring it here if (it would) destroy the
sanctity or the solitude.''
   Traditionally, the 2,500-foot clim up Mount Sinai was not meant
to be comfortable.
   Early in the Christian era, as pious men in Egypt developed the
practice that became known as monasticism, self-denial and the
search for solitude brought the first hermits to caves in Sinai's
rocky walls. Today, one hermit-monk still lives in the hills, in
the name of sacrifice.
   Every day, at sunrise and sunset, scores of outsiders wind their
way to a chapel atop Mount Sinai dedicated to the Holy Trinity.
   Misr Sinai's cable car, designed by Egyptian and Swiss
engineers, would facilitate their trek, ascending 1,650 feet up
adjoining Mount Safsafa.
   From the upper terminal, tourists would continue to the top of
Mount Sinai on foot. The two-minute ride would cut 45 minutes from
the usual 2{-hour climb.
   The project's cost of $2.3 million would be financed by the
Ministry of Housing, Utilities and New Communities.
   Mount Safsafa is a few hundred yards from the Monastery of St.
Catherine. Across a paved road from the prospective cable car's
lower terminal is the chapel of the Prophet Aaron, built where
legend says the restless Israelites donated their jewelry to build
a golden calf.
   The Old Testament stories of Moses, the Burning Bush and the
mountain of the Ten Commandments have been made the area holy since
earliest Christianity.
   In 330, the Byzantine empress Helena dedicated a chapel to the
Virgin Mary in the shelter of the Sinai peaks.
   Two hundred years later, Emperor Justinian ordered a great
walled fortress built around the site of the Burning Bush. The fort
remains as the Monastery of St. Catherine, a living relic for the
13 Greek Orthodox monks who call it home.
   It has been protected by Crusaders, the Moslem Prophet Mohammed,
Arab rulers, Napoleon and, in this century, the Israeli and
Egyptian governments.
   Priceless collections of icons and manuscripts, and a library
second in religious importance only to the Vatican's, make St.
Catherine's a major antiquities treasure.
   As traditional keepers of the area's hills, chapels, caves and
tombs, the monks oppose the cable car. They already must deal with
up to 100 visitors a day.
   ``Look at all this beauty,'' said Archbishop Damianos, sitting
in the stillness of his monastery office. ``The Egyptian government
can make the project because they can force it, but we do not
agree. We've never agreed to it.''
   Neither did 10 people asked as they stood with several dozen
others near the chapel atop Mount Sinai, awaiting the famous
sunrise.
   A Michigan student attending American University in Cairo, who
did not want his name used, said he has experienced the sunrise
five times, but ``if they build a cable car, I'll never come
again.''
   ``It's important to climb up,'' said Dirk Glaesmann of West
Germany. ``You feel a part of the mountain. If you put up a cable
car, the whole thing would lose its appeal.''
   An Egyptian environmentalist, Mohammed Kassas of Cairo
University, feels the cable car would be an eyesore where there now
is beauty.
   ``If they wanted to pick a worse place to put the cable car,
they couldn't find it,'' Kassas said, and added:
   ``The area already has lost most of its animal life, like the
Sinai leopard. It's about to lose its plant life. ... The summit
already gets crowded. What's going to happen now?''
   Project engineer Ibrahim Moharram of Ein Shams University in
Cairo said the funicular railway, with two 15-passenger cars, would
pose no danger.
   ``Before we designed the cable car we took everything into
consideration: how many people would ride it, the environment,
emergency procedures, electrical supply,'' he said.
   ``It won't ruin the landscape because it goes up inside a
natural curve in the rock. Even the terminals will be small and
made of rocks, to fit into the scenery.''
   Criticism is not new to Bassiouni, the Misr Sinai chairman. He
faced opposition in the mid-1980s when he built the St. Catherine's
Village Hotel on the Plain of er-Raha, said to be the campground of
the Israelites while Moses was on Mount Sinai receiving the Ten
Commandments from God.
   ``You can propose a road and people will object, but in the end
everybody will use it,'' he said in Cairo, 245 miles away. ``The
same will be true here. People will thank us.''

   Silver was his downfall. Now it's part of his
salvation.
   Nelson Bunker Hunt recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings after losing $1.5 billion with his brother, William
Herbert Hunt, speculating in the silver futures market.
   Now Bunker has put his collection of ancient coins on the
Sotheby's auction block _ what is said to be the greatest such
collection owned by one person ever to be sold.
   Sotheby's also is selling Herbert's collection of ancient
bronzes and Byzantine coins, and together the Hunt treasures are
expected to fetch more than $20 million.
   Bunker flew to New York from his home in Dallas one recent day
to talk about silver tetradrachms and decadrachms, the money and
preserved wonders of long ago civilizations.
   His eyes scan a table at Sotheby's where ancient coins in
sparkling silver and shattering gold silently stare at modern
times. Some are as small as a thumbnail and weigh but a few grams.
Others have the diameter of a silver dollar and would add a
welcomed weight to any pocket. One is as large as an angry fist.
   They are so beautifully defined, they could have emerged from
the engraver's chisel only moments earlier. Some bear the artisan's
name. All, when held, seem to tremble with the mysteries of time.
   A silver decadrachm of Agrigentum shows a two-wheeled chariot
with four horses driven by the sun god Helios. An eagle soars above
carrying a snake; below, a crab scampers between pounding hooves.
The reverse design shows two eagles with a dead hare lying on rocks.
   The coin was struck circa 411 B.C. It is only the seventh
specimen of its type, weighs almost 2 ounces and measures about 1{
inches in diameter. It was made to celebrate Exainetus, a citizen
of Agrigentum, who had won in the Olympic games.
   Another, much smaller coin is the extremely rare Ides of March
denarius of Brutus, struck to mark the assassination of Julius
Caesar in 44 B.C. The obverse (the side of a coin bearing the main
design) shows the bare head of Brutus; the reverse shows a pileus
(a brimless hat worn in ancient Rome) between two daggers.
   Hunt's collection of almost 3,000 coins in silver, gold and
bronze not only attests to the magnificent artistry of ancient
engravers, but also documents 1,000 years of history, from the
Archaic period in Greece to the fall of the Roman Empire in 476 A.D.
   It took the 64-year-old Hunt about six years to amass his
collection. He sought coins from around the world, largely in
Switzerland, and kept them in a Delaware bank vault.
   Parting for the fallen Texas tycoon is indeed sweet sorrow.
   ``I hate to have to sell them, but that's what life is.
Sometimes you buy and sometimes you sell,'' he said.
   ``It's like friends. You hope to make new friends as time goes
on, and you hope you won't lose all your old friends. I'll miss
them and it's been a great pleasure collecting them and owning
them, but I'll just have to go and do the best I can. I don't know
if I'll ever be an art collector again, but I enjoy going to
museums.''
   Hunt also is selling 15 Greek vases, ranging in style from the
geometrical designs of the early Archaic period (about the 7th
century B.C.) to the more fluid style of the Classical Age. The
drawings chronicle the vicissitudes of everyday life: the departure
of Herakles (a mortal hero) for Olympus; Hypnos (sleep) and
Thanatos (death) carrying the body of Sarpedon; athletes; putting
on armor; a concert.
   His brother's collection of ancient bronzes covers the entire
span of classical art from the Italian bronze age (8th century
B.C.) through the Roman art of the 3rd century A.D. His collection
of Byzantine coins is said to be the largest privately held.
   The sons of flamboyant oil baron H.L. Hunt, a gambler who turned
a $5,000 inheritance into one of the biggest family fortunes in
America, were pushed into bankruptcy by lawsuits and Internal
Revenue Service claims in 1989 that Bunker owed $730.42 million for
back taxes and interest, and that Herbert owed $317.31 million.
Including other creditors, Bunker's debts topped $1.5 billion and
Herbert's almost $1.2 billion.
   In September 1988, the brothers filed for protection from their
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code after a
Peruvian mining company won a $196 million judgment against them
for their attempt, according to a federal jury in New York, to
corner the silver market in 1979 and 1980. The brothers denied any
wrongdoing.
   ``I had silver, but I didn't corner any market because the
market obviously was a very big market,'' Bunker Hunt said. ``But
people do accuse you of things _ sometimes quite unjustly.
   ``I had a lot of silver and a big position in silver, and
ultimately the market, as you know, became nonliquid where you
couldn't sell and you couldn't buy, and that's what really
destroyed, in my opinion, the value of silver.''
   The brothers ultimately lost $1.5 billion after amassing 59
million ounces of silver, then estimated at one-third the world
supply. Falling real estate prices and the collapse of the oil
market worsened matters.
   The Sotheby's auction is part of the liquidation plan. Other
assets that were sold off or that will be sold, include Australian
ranch and farm land; an 81,290-acre ranch in southeastern Oklahoma;
a 9,012-acre ranch that straddles the Tennessee-Mississippi state
line; thoroughbred race horses (at one time he owned 700); large
pieces of land in Alaska, California and Arizona; and a bowling
alley.
   But the coin collection is his biggest loss, Bunker said.
   ``It's something I enjoyed very much, and I'm told by some of
the experts that it's probably the finest collection in the
world,'' he said. ``That was my intention _ to build up the finest
collection that a person could get.
   ``But,'' he sighed, ``all good things come to an end sometimes,
and I know these new buyers will enjoy them.''
   Bunker, who recently lost holdings in Penrod Drilling Co. to
various banks, plans to go back to work. ``I'm going to work at
some things I know such as the oil business and gas business and
explorations.''
   Meanwhile, the Hunt collections of ancient wealth will travel
the globe to attract buyers, stopping in Los Angeles, Chicago,
London, Frankfurt, Munich, Monte Carlo, Zurich, Geneva, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Tokyo and Osaka.
   Initial sales will take place at Sotheby's in New York in June,
a second in December. Bunker's Islamic coin collection will be sold
by Sotheby's in London in March 1991, and the final sale of
Herbert's Byzantine coins will be held in New York in June 1991.

<DATELINE>PEARL LAGOON, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Along the grassy streets of Pearl
Lagoon, on the edge of its lonely dock, in hammocks swaying in the
shade, people are waiting for the Revolution, a ferry boat as
elusive as a campaign promise.
   It sailed into the lagoon on the Sunday after Nicaragua's
election, spent an hour or so, then sailed away.
   A few people rode on the ferry, many just heard of it, but
everyone seems to have an opinion about it.
   ``Some people think it is progress,'' said Irma de Sosa, a
schoolteacher who has become an authority on the subject by virtue
of being one of those who rode.
   ``Some feel like the government is just fooling the people, that
the boat won't come back,'' she said, spreading her hands and
smiling.
   ``We'll just have to wait and see.''
   The Sandinista government, far away in Managua, had long
promised Pearl Lagoon a ferry for the 30-mile run to Bluefields
port, the link to the rest of the world for Nicaragua's thinly
populated Atlantic coast.
   That single visit by the Revolution, a 150-passenger vessel, is
the only evidence residents have seen.
   In many ways, the ferry symbolizes the region's long fight for
autonomy, for some control of its own fate.
   Places like this town of 1,900 are the essence of the Atlantic
coast, an English-speaking area so isolated from the rest of
Nicaragua that it seems like another country.
   Not a shot was fired here when the Sandinistas overthrew the
late President Anastasio Somoza in 1979, and the Atlantic coast was
largely untouched. More than a decade later, there still is no road
between it and the Spanish-speaking Pacific side of Nicaragua.
   It was not the first time revolution passed the region by.
   When the rest of Central America was fighting for independence
from Spain, the coast was a British protectorate with Miskito
Indian royalty. British buccaneers raided the Spanish fleet with
ships built in Pearl Lagoon.
   The Atlantic coast region is home to one-tenth of Nicaragua's
3.3 million people, a rich mixture of Creoles, Latinos and Sumo,
Rama, Garifona and Miskito Indians. It includes half the national
territory of about 50,000 square miles.
   Pearl Lagoon has a couple of Toyota trucks, but the green
streets look more like the fairways of a golf course. It doesn't
receive television from Managua, 200 miles to the west.
   As with most hamlets dotting the coves, inlets and rivers, water
is Pearl Lagoon's only link to the world.
   A regular ferry, a boat of its own, would mean a measure of
independence and an end to the balmy isolation that envelops the
lagoon like a daydream.
   The Atlantic coast is the poorest region of one of the
hemisphere's poorest nations, but Pearl Lagoon is a fortune in the
raw.
   It rests on the banks of one of the richest breeding grounds of
the succulent white shrimp, on the edge of rich lobster beds. It is
the kind of place that feeds the dreams of entrepreneurs.
   A businessman remembered simply as The Chinaman, the lagoon's
last success story, dried and exported shrimp. The Sandinistas
confiscated his shrimp plant, fishing boats and rice mill, and
drove The Chinaman into exile.
   ``The boats went to Bluefields,'' said Leslie Hunsack, a
60-year-old fisherman. ``It did us no good here in Pearl Lagoon.''
   After the Sandinistas nationalized the fishing industry, Pearl
Lagoon was left with a single customer that set its own price: the
government.
   Fishermen say months sometimes pass between the visits by boats
from outside to pick up the catch. ``We have our nets out and we
catch this fish and we can't do anything with it,'' said Linton
Fox, a community leader.
   At least two young fishermen have died trying to make an extra
dollar a pound on their lobster. They were shot by government
agents while on smuggling runs to the Colombian island of San
Andreas, 110 miles southeast of Pearl Lagoon.
   ``We have always felt like a colony inside a country,'' said
labor leader Alvin Guthrie, a Creole from the coast elected to the
new National Assembly. ``Under the Sandinistas, it was like having
Spanish viceroys around.''
   In the northern Atlantic coast region, the Managua government's
attempts to enforce its policies provoked a bloody uprising of
Miskito Indians.
   Finally, the Sandinistas admitted they had made mistakes and
passed a regional autonomy law that, at least in theory, was the
most sweeping in Latin America.
   Autonomy remains a promise, however, not a reality.
   Members of the first autonomous councils, one for the north
coast and one for the south, where Pearl Lagoon and Bluefields are
located, were chosen in the Feb. 25 general elections.
   Still to be negotiated is the relationship between the regional
and central governments, at heart a question of control over gold,
lumber and fishing resources.
   ``We don't know much about autonomy,'' said Fox, a member of the
regional assembly. ``But we'd have the rights to our property. Our
lumber, our fish, our shrimps would go to build up our little town,
not to build up Managua or Bluefields.''
   The Sandinistas failed to overcome the suspicions and
hostilities of the coast with the autonomy project. Like the rest
of Nicaragua, the coast voted against them in the February election.
   Sandinista leaders predict autonomy would die under the
government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, which takes
office April 25.
   Her conservative alliance's platform does not mention autonomy
and Sandinista leaders say its goal of privatization is
incompatible with local control of the region's riches.
   ``The backbone for autonomy is the natural resources, what is in
the sea and what is in the forest,'' said Johnny Hodgson, a
Sandinista leader in Bluefields.
   British and American companies that exploited the coast, the
Somoza dictatorship, the Sandinistas _ none brought prosperity or
gave the coast a real say in its affairs.
   Hunsack, the fisherman, picked up his saw and prepared to cut
another board.
   He is tired of waiting for the Revolution, and is building his
own boat.
   ``This autonomy the Sandinistas had, they were using people as a
tool,'' Hunsack said. ``We expect better. We couldn't get worse.''

<TEXT>
   In the quiet of the morning, when the sun
peeks over the rolling farm fields, the trek to the golden dome
begins. One by one, businessmen arrive, ready to start their day _
by sitting in silence.
   There are oil brokers and engineers. A toymaker, too. All are
successful entrepreneurs. And all are meditators.
   Thousands of souls have flocked to this meditation mecca, home
of Maharishi International University, to study, share a lifestyle
and build their own businesses _ a trend that has spawned
prosperity and growth in an isolated patch of America's heartland.
   ``It is a remarkable community,'' says Daniel Dittemore, head of
the Iowa Product Development Corporation, a state-sponsored seed
capital investment program. ``They have an uncommon appetite and
knack for entrepreneurship.''
   In the last several years, scores of transcendental meditators
have moved their companies to Fairfield or begun new ones here.
There's an ice cream maker who markets to stores in New York,
Chicago and other cities, a chimney sweep supplier with thousands
of customers, a studio that photographs many of the country's top
marathons, and a toymaker who produces the Zube Tube, a hot-selling
cylinder touted as the ``ultimate cosmic sound machine.''
   Others are engineers, attorneys, insurance agents or computer
experts. By one estimate, there are about 20 computer companies,
thus the nickname ``Silicorn Valley.''
   ``There's a remarkable population of technologically oriented
companies out of all proportion of what you'd expect to find in a
community that size,'' said Dittemore.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad has dubbed Fairfield, a town of 11,000,
one of the state's economic ``superstars.''
   The local business chamber doesn't track the number of companies
run or owned by meditators, but some in the community claim such
firms employ about 1,000 people and more than 50 do business
nationally or overseas.
   ``We've put a lot of energy into this town, a lot of money, a
lot of talent and a lot of job opportunities,'' said John Narducci,
president of Chappell Studio-Marathon Foto, which photographs
marathons and nearly a quarter-million graduates annually.
   ``Any small town in the Midwest would like to have 2,500
people,'' said Jerry Leahy, a meditator who is board chairman of
Overland Outfitters, a family-owned outerwear firm with 11 stores
nationwide. ``It just isn't often you have them come in and bring
their own jobs and bring their own payroll.''
   Though meditators contribute to Fairfield's success, they're not
the prime movers, said Mike Brouwer, executive vice president of
the Chamber of Commerce, which has about 400 members.
   ``I'm not willing to slight 22 major manufacturers in this
community _ some have been here over 100 years,'' he said.
   But he credits the meditators with creating innovative ways to
support themselves.
   Some come because of the university, others because ``the
benefits seem to grow when you're meditating with other people,''
said Patty Schneider, public affairs chief at the college, founded
by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Indian guru who once dazzled the
Beatles and other celebrities.
   Transcendental meditators believe if they gather in large
numbers, they create the ``Maharishi Effect'' _ a positive
influence on events ranging from global conflicts to the rate of
traffic deaths. More than 7,000 meditators gathered here in 1983
for the ``Taste of Utopia.''
   Each morning and afternoon, meditators practice their technique
in the Golden Domes of Pure Knowledge _ one for ladies, one for
gents, to avoid distractions.
   Estimates of meditators range from 2,000 to 3,000; many attend
or work at the university, which moved from California in 1974 into
the campus of defunct Parsons College and has a full-time
enrollment of 799. Meditators also run their own school for
elementary and high school students.
   Male MIU students often wear ties and jackets, and jeans are
discouraged.
   The strait-laced appearance fits in well with mid-America, and
meditators work side-by-side with non-meditators in businesses and
the City Council.
   But ``there's still the dividing line between those people and
some people in the community,'' said Royse Huff, president of the
Fairfield Economic Development Association.
   Some things remain destined to stay separate, such as the yogic
flying competitions, which prompted one enterprising company years
ago to sell cushions to soften levitation landings.
   Yogic flying, according to Vedic tradition, has three stages:
hopping (usually cross-legged on a padded course), hovering and
flying. ``We have been in the first stage quite a number of
years,'' Mrs. Schneider says.
   Such happenings trigger jokes and the nickname ``the flying
university.''
   Brouwer doesn't mind. ``I have such a thick skin over it over
the years that it doesn't bother me because there are so many good
things that come out of the relationship between MIU and
Fairfield,'' he said.
   Mayor Bob Rasmussen sees envy behind the tongue-in-cheek teasing.
   ``We don't have a lot of empty buildings, valuation of houses
has increased substantially,'' he said. ``They can make all the fun
they want. We're doing just fine, and thank you.''
   The town, he added, is not about to lose its identity. ``I'm a
strong believer we have enough of a solid base ... it's not going
to be a matter of them taking over the city,'' he said.
   But the mayor also noted attitudes have changed since the early
days when some townsfolk wondered if the meditators were a cult or
a religion.
   ``There's certainly a stronger acceptance ... (and) less
divisiveness,'' he said. ``They've integrated much better ... We
respect each other and get along.''
   ``Iowans have a work ethic and a sense of clean living that we
fit very well with as a group,'' said Rob Glazier, a meditator
whose engineering firm has grown from four employees to 75 in three
years.
   Some say acceptance just took time.
   ``People in a town like this have been here three or four
generations,'' said Bob Daniels, a meditator with a chimney sweep
supply company. ``They may want to take 10 years checking you out.
That's not bad.''
   Glazier said old-line business leaders also realize ``we're a
larger economic force,'' attracting outside capital.
   Indeed, Huff praises the meditators for demonstrating ``how
business can be done internationally.'' Others say they've added a
cosmopolitan flavor to Fairfield.
   But problems remain. While meditators are terrific promoters,
Brouwer said there's a credibility gap. ``They traditionally say
things before they do things,'' he said, and ``market before the
fact.'' Huff also said there has been a ``tremendous turnover'' of
meditator businesses.
   There have been legal troubles, too. The state sued a
self-proclaimed ``millionaire maker'' after he failed to make
refunds to 10,000 consumers who bought his no-down-payment real
estate courses advertised on TV. A $3.5 million judgment was
entered against him, but he has filed for bankruptcy.
   The meditators remain committed to their goal of creating heaven
on earth.
   ``We're not quite as utopian,'' the mayor responds. ``When they
say this is heaven, I like Fairfield, but I like Naples, Fla.,
too.''

<TEXT>
   Congressional watchdogs continue to nip at the
Agriculture Department in hopes the creaky old agency will
modernize itself before the 20th century ends.
   But the structure and inertia of USDA are formidable. Attempts
have been made for 45 years _ largely unsuccessful _ to streamline
departmental field structure and management.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has been studying USDA organization and departmental
inhibitions for at least two years. A preliminary report was issued
in December.
   Formal responses to GAO's analysis will be sought from
departmental agencies and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
when the final report is ready later in the year.
   Meanwhile, the GAO has followed up its initial review with a
supplemental report to Yeutter about the need for improved
workforce planning in his department. Such planning should be
mandatory, the GAO said.
   At its simplest, workforce planning means getting the right
people in the right jobs, now and over the long haul. The object is
to deliver government services to the public, efficiently and
economically.
   The problems involve 36 agencies that carry out the department's
policies and programs. In 1988, the GAO said, those functions cost
taxpayers more than $44 billion and required the services of
110,000 full-time employees in more than 15,000 places around the
world.
   ``USDA agencies are experiencing problems recruiting highly
skilled workers, providing adequate training to employees,
developing effective managers, and managing a culturally diverse
workforce,'' the latest report said. ``These problems are
longstanding, pervasive and will likely continue given present
trends in USDA and in the federal government.''
   The growing importance of food safety, water quality and
biotechnology requires more scientists in USDA's workforce. Yet a
shortage of scientists generally, as well as competition from the
private sector, put USDA at a disadvantage.
   Moreover, the report said, agencies within USDA ``sometimes find
themselves competing against each other for people from the same
job occupations, a condition which is counterproductive from a
departmental standpoint.''
   Another inhibitor has been the lack of a departmental recruiting
program. Each USDA agency goes its own way and generally does not
refer unneeded applicants to other agencies.
   However, the report noted that the department's Office of
Personnel has recently contracted to develop a videotape for
recruiting new employees.
   ``As the agricultural economy becomes more consumer-driven than
production-oriented, USDA needs employees with backgrounds in
marketing management to supplement the skills of their other
employees trained in the agricultural sciences,'' the report said.
   When the GAO looked at employee training, there were many
indications of ``poorly or inadequately trained staff'' in a number
of areas. Also, the report cited ``continuing problems in achieving
and maintaining an ethnically diverse workforce'' of women and
minorities.
   A major GAO complaint is that department agencies generally
address only a single year's needs to patch up a problem when
long-range remedies are in order. This has been apparent in the
Farmers Home Administration and the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service, for example.
   But the report said some USDA agencies ``are laying the
groundwork for effective workforce planning.''
   For example, the Forest Service uses a ``strategic human
resource guide'' to forecast skill-mix changes and attrition
through 1995. The forecasts are used in preparing annual job
recruitment recommendations and for measuring progress toward
employment goals.
   Another is the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which
is reorganizing its personnel function to include workforce
planning.
   ``Although these tentative steps toward workforce planning are
encouraging, without central direction and support the initiatives
may be stifled, and those agencies without workforce planning may
never develop it,'' the report said.
   GAO said department personnel leaders recognize the importance
of workforce planning ``but have not taken a leadership role in
developing ... guidance for agencies to follow nor have they
instituted a mechanism for tracking and monitoring individual
agency tracking systems.''
   The report acknowledged that department personnel officials
recently organized a task force to improve USDA's image as an
employer and thereby ``enhancing its ability to recruit and retain
quality employees.''
   But the GAO also noted that the department's personnel office
lacked the funds and people to operate the task force on its own,
so individual agencies were asked to chip in.
   ``However, there still exists no departmental policy on
workforce planning,'' the report said.
   ``Consistent workforce-planning standards and guidance are
needed to encourage all agencies to initiate workforce planning and
to reinforce agencies' efforts already undertaken,'' the report
said.

   Bob Thorlakson looked back at 22 years in the
Army and ahead to the shrinking military of the post-Cold War '90s,
and made a decision.
   ``I got out. I decided not to wait around for the cuts to hit,''
he says.
   Thorlakson and untold numbers of other men and women in the
American armed forces are trying to make their peace with peace.
   Some are leaving. Many more are considering it. Most apparently
are hoping to hold on, unsure they'll avoid the ax but unwilling
just now to give up the uniform and make the leap back to civilian
life.
   ``You read so much about the cutbacks that are coming down the
road,'' says Lt. Col. Bill Daniels, who plans to retire this year
after he completes his 20th year in the Air Force.
   These private struggles are being played out across the nation
and at U.S. bases abroad as the Bush administration and Congress
scale down defenses in light of a suddenly receding Soviet military
threat. Big force reductions are coming _ some estimate 300,000
people over four years _ although the crunch is not likely to hit
many military families until next year.
   Thorlakson, 45, didn't know when he retired last December if he
would have been forced out by the cutbacks. He held the rank of
lieutenant colonel and was nearly eligible for promotion. But the
Army's future _ and thus his own _ looked so murky he took his
chances on a civilian job.
   Like many others who had never held a job outside the military,
Thorlakson stumbled at first. He took a job selling family
financial services but soon found it didn't suit him. He quit. Now
he is looking for work in personnel management.
   Thorlakson, of suburban Washington, is confident he'll find a
good job. But for many others facing similar decisions, the
prospect of change can be intimidating _ even though it's too early
to know how many one-time soldiers will be competing for civilian
jobs.
   ``They are apprehensive. They don't know what's going on,'' says
Jack Merritt, a retired Army general who keeps in close contact
with servicemen. He is executive vice president of the Association
of the United States Army, a champion of Army causes.
   The fear is felt even among those just entering the service.
   Merritt spoke recently to ROTC cadets at Norwich University, a
military school in Northfield, Vt.
   ``That was foremost on their minds: `Is there a future for me
now?'
   ``My answer is, of course there's a future, but it will be a
future for fewer people,'' he says.
   Pentagon planners are worried, too. They've never had to shrink
an all-volunteer force, which now has 2.1 million active-duty
personnel. Many careers will be slowed, many ended. And some will
be changed even before they begin. A recent Pentagon report to
Congress said many ROTC students, some of whom signed up as long as
five years ago, will not be allowed to enter active duty. They'll
have to serve their required time in the reserves.
   Soon, probably starting next year, the pink slip will start
coming. The Pentagon is concerned that this might hurt morale and
discourage America's youth from taking a chance on the military in
the future.
   In force reductions following World War II and the Korean and
Vietnam wars, thousands of draftees were itching to turn in their
weapons and get back into civvies.
   ``That's not true today,'' Christopher Jehn, the assistant
defense secretary for force management and personnel, said in an
interview. ``Everybody in the military wants to be there, including
many who believe they made a career commitment to the military.''
   ``They've all got contracts with us,'' Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said recently. ``And so how we treat them is going to have a
big impact on our continued ability to recruit and retain
first-class people to serve in the military.''
   The problem is most acute in the Army, which plans to cut about
135,000 from its total force of 770,000 by 1994. And Congress could
order more.
   Most Army cuts will hit the enlisted ranks, but officers also
will be dropped. The Pentagon recently asked Congress for greater
authority to fire officers in grades below lieutenant colonel. It
said this would be done only as a last resort, but added: ``The
Army's situation is severe enough to warrant such action,'' even if
more is done to encourage officers and others to quit voluntarily.
   Brig. Gen. Timothy Stroup, the Army's top personnel manager,
says one of his main goals is to prevent ex-soldiers from feeling
they were unfairly forced to leave.
   ``They go back to the hometowns of America ... to be the fathers
and mothers of the next generation of young men and women that join
the military,'' Stroup said. ``It's important that we have
satisfied alumni.''
   Adds Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee: ``Memories are long. If we botch
the job now in scaling back military spending, can we depend on an
all-volunteer force to come to our rescue in the future?''
   Many in Congress are calling for deeper and swifter reductions
than the administration has proposed. They know that the quickest
path to a ``peace dividend'' is to save on troop costs, even though
the Defense Department cautions against a politically inspired rush
to retrench. The Pentagon spends nearly half its $300
billion-a-year budget on manpower.
   The Pentagon says it can reach its goal of shrinking the armed
forces by 50,000 people this year with few if any firings. Fewer
recruits will be hired to fill the usual number of vacancies left
by retirements, resignations, deaths and discharges.
   Attrition alone won't do the trick in 1991, though, or for the
next several years.
   Because the services have not yet resorted to dismissals, the
fear of firing is only beginning to set in.
   ``When you see those cuts, then you'll see a different attitude
among the young kids with 10 or 12 years of service: `Where am I
going?' they'll wonder,'' says Col. Fred Allega, a Marine pilot who
is retiring, but not because of the coming squeeze.
   ``People are feeling more secure than they should,'' says Navy
Capt. Bruce Sherman.

   Stanley D. Hyman, president of Identify Research Institute,
which advises military people on making the transition to civilian
life, says most soldiers are at least vaguely aware of the painful
adjustments they face but are trying to ignore them.
   ``It's like they're thinking, `I know I'm going to the dentist
to have all my teeth pulled, but it's next year. I'm all right now.
When it's going to be tomorrow, I worry.'''
   Hyman hears from soldiers around the country. One recent day,
while talking with a visitor at his home in McLean, Va., Hyman got
a call from a sailor who said he was thinking of quitting because
his base at Norfolk, Va., would be cutting back.
   ``This guy is scared,'' Hyman said after hanging up.
   Signs of increased anxiety among military people are just
beginning to appear, says Hyman, who has been advising service
families for more than 20 years. He predicts the force reductions
will take a heavy emotional toll in the next several years.
   ``We're going to see more suicides, more family breakups,'' he
says.
   Jehn, the Pentagon personnel chief, says he needs Congress' help
to make the force reductions as quickly as required yet as painless
for people as possible.
   The Defense Department is asking for authority to provide
severance pay to enlisted people who get the ax _ something never
done before. Under current law, officers cut after five to 20 years
of service are given one month's base pay for each year of service,
up to $30,000. Jehn said enlisted people should get equal treatment.
   Stroup, the Army personnel chief, said the department also needs
more latitude to cut officers.
   ``We don't want to do that, but we have to reduce the force and
you want to keep your force balanced so you don't have too many
senior officers and no junior officers,'' he said.
   Jehn said the department also is developing an experimental
program, in cooperation with the Labor Department, to help
servicemen with 10 to 14 years of experience to adjust to the
civilian job market. They will be advised on ways of searching for
a job, conducting themselves in job interviews, and writing resumes.
   ``Those kinds of things most of these people aren't going to
know,'' he said.

   The Lutherans want Philip Morris to get out of
the tobacco business.
   Minnesota's state employees want Texaco to pledge not to
discriminate against Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland. Animal
rights groups want better living conditions for the chickens
purchased by Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   These and scores of other organizations are using investments in
U.S. corporations to pressure ``their'' companies to adopt their
positions on political and social issues.
   This year the hot issue is the environment, with the
shareholders of more than 30 companies proposing that they be
allowed to vote on issues ranging from putting environmentalists on
corporate boards to redesigning Exxon's tanker fleet.
   When Exxon holds its annual meeting April 25 and when Exxon
shareholders get proxy ballots in the mail, no fewer than eight
environmental proposals will be raised by stockholders.
   But environmental issues are by no means the only ones being
raised from within corporate America.
   The Conservative Caucus, for example, wants Chevron to refuse to
deal with governments that vote more than 80 percent of the time
against the U.S. position at the United Nations.
   The United Methodist Church and other denominations working
through the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility want
Bristol-Myers Squibb to stop advertising infant formula on
television.
   The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wants
Pepsico to investigate living conditions of the chickens it buys
for its subsidiary, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   What these stockholder activists are practicing is called
corporate democracy.
   In fact, some of these investors own stocks for the sole purpose
of influencing a company's course. They'e out to make a point, not
a profit.
   Corporate democracy got its start in 1932, when Lewis Gilbert,
then a young newspaperman, was gaveled to silence when he tried to
ask some questions at the annual meeting of Consolidated Gas Co.,
in which he owned 10 shares.
   Gilbert stormed out, quit his job and has devoted his life to
fighting ``this silent dictatorship over other people's money.''
Ever since, he and his brother John have attended as many as 100
annual meetings a year to demand that management heed stockholders.
   Most corporations hold their annual meetings in the spring, so
many a chief executive officer is preparing for a day of frayed
nerves.
   Not that the stockholder proponents will win. They hardly ever
do. Last year, about 500 stockholder proposals were advanced, 170
of them reached a vote but only five got a majority.
   In any case, the proposals are only advisory. They don't compel
management to do anything, although management often gets the
message _ and often negotiates to meet the stockholders' demands
even before the issue reaches a vote.
   It used to be commonplace for stockholder proposals to get under
3 percent of the vote or less.
   ``But these days, we often get 10 to 25 percent, and it sends a
strong message when management knows that such a critical mass of
their shareholders want them to leave South Africa or improve their
environmental records,'' says Timothy Smith, who runs the
Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.
   Smith's group coordinates the investments of 240 Roman Catholic
and Protestant church groups with assets of $25 billion. This
spring, the churches are bringing proposals before the stockholders
of more than 150 companies.
   Asked why corporations negotiate when they're sure of beating
down stockholder proposals, Smith said, ``One chief executive
officer told us, `It is not in the best interests of our company to
be seen doing battle with the Christian church on an important
ethcial issue.'''
   So proponents claim some impressive victories even though they
technically lost.
   A number of U.S. companies have cut ties with South Africa.
Stockholder activists say they are due some of the credit for
cracks in the walls of apartheid.
   Keeping the pressure on, institutions with assets of over $250
billion have filed proposals this year that call on additional
companies to sever South African ties.
   In the 1970s and 1980s, more than 100 planned nuclear plants
were canceled, in part from pressure by anti-nuclear stockholder
groups.
   Keeping track of corporate democracy _ who's proposing what to
whom _ is the business of the Investor Responsibility Research
Center, a non-profit Washington outfit that owes its existence to a
black student protest at Harvard University in 1972.
   The students had taken over a campus building to demand that the
university sell its Gulf Oil stock on the grounds that Gulf was
supporting Angola's status as the black colony of a white nation,
Portugal.
   Harvard President Derek Bok had difficulty finding the facts of
the case. The university said that if it simply sold its Gulf stock
it would forfeit ``any power it has to influence Gulf's policies.''
   That episode led to the decision by some of the biggest names in
philanthrophy _ the Ford, Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations, all
with heavy portfolios _ to create IRRC. They gave it the mission of
assembling impartial information about corporate behavior and
stockholder proposals.
   ``I think corporations behave somewhat differently knowing that
more and more and bigger and bigger shareholders are looking over
their shoulders,'' says executive director Margaret Carroll, who
has been with the center from the start.
   Part of IRRC's mission is informing institutional investors of
the proposals raised by activists.
   Pension funds, banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, college
endowment funds, foundations and other vast pools of money account
for 75 percent of the trading at the New York Stock Exchange. They
have a fiduciary responsibility to know what they are voting on.
   About 350 institutions, from the Bank of America to the
Archdiocese of New York, pay IRRC from $800 to $22,000 a year to
keep track of 1,500 corporations.
   The center gathers data from the corporations themselves, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, newspaper clippings and the
fine print on the ballots known as proxy statements that companies
mail shareholders. These tell what the proponents want to do, and
why the board of directors doesn't want to do it.
   ``We find the materials they produce quite useful,'' says Jim
Heidelberg, assistant to the executive director of the Minnesota
State Board of Investment, which invests $12.6 billion in pension
funds of Minnesota state employees and retirees.
   Adds the Interfaith Center's Timothy Smith: ``Their research is
exceptionally important. It is used around the country by
shareholders who attempt to act as socially responsible investors.''
   The Minnesota legislature has passed laws prohibiting the
investment of retirement funds in certain ways. So, in its role as
an investor, Minnesota is asking fellow stockholders of such
companies as Texaco, Security Pacific and Sonoco to vote to request
a report on corporate attempts to combat anti-Catholic bias in
their facilities in Northern Ireland. Other states do the same.
   Under SEC regulations, corporations may deny a place on the
proxy ballot for proposals that deal with ``ordinary business
operations.'' On those grounds, tobacco companies were able to beat
back proposals dealing with tobacco sales.
   But this year, the SEC staff reversed itself and allowed a
tobacco question to go before stockholders. So shareholders of
Philip Morris and two other tobacco companies will vote on whether
their companies should get out of the tobacco business by Dec. 31,
1999.

<NOTE>Eds: Film opened March 23.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Q. How many times can the Cinderella story be told? A. As often
as ``Hamlet'' can be staged _ as long as it's done with talent and
imagination.
   Happily, that has been accomplished with ``Pretty Woman,'' in
which Cinderella turns out to be a novice hooker and Prince
Charming is a ruthless corporate raider. During their one-week
romance, they reform each other and achieve a happy if illogical
ending.
   What makes ``Pretty Woman'' so palatable is a star-making
performance by Julia Roberts, whose glowing smile will grace many a
future film. Already impressive as a dramatic actress in ``Steel
Magnolias'' (and the only member of the stellar cast to win an
Academy nomination), she is stunning in comedy.
   The film also benefits from an airtight script by J.F. Lawton,
an expert in one-liners and sight gags, and from the surehanded
direction by Garry Marshall. A veteran of the sitcom wars, Marshall
knows how to milk laughs out of any situation. He can polish a
throwaway gem, such as a convertible gliding down Rodeo Drive with
the driver on a telephone and a youngster talking on his own phone.
   Credulity is strained at the beginning when Julia Roberts is
seen in the snake-pit milieu of Hollywood Boulevard, wearing a
Dutch-boy wig and a come-on look. Richard Gere comes along, seeking
directions and needing someone to drive a stick-shift car borrowed
from his lawyer. Roberts and Gere drive to the Regent Beverly
Wilshire Hotel and use his penthouse suite in pursuit of her
profession.
   The multimillionaire is amused by the ingenuous hooker and
engages her as his companion during a week of maneuvers for a
takeover of a shipbuilding corporation owned by Ralph Bellamy. The
arrangement puts Roberts in hilarious situations, some baldly
lifted from ``My Fair Lady.'' Instead of Ascot racetrack, Roberts
mixes with the swells at a polo match.
   ``Pretty Woman'' has its flaws. The saccharine ending is a
letdown, and the villainy by Gere's lawyer, Jason Alexander,
becomes overwrought. But during most of its length, the film
fascinates, largely because of the incandescent Roberts. Her tussle
with escargot in a posh restaurant is a screamer.
   Gere is in splendid form as well, underplaying his role as the
financial shark whose life is changed by the Hollywood hustler.
Hector Elizondo is marvelous as the hotel manager who befriends his
unwanted guest, and Laura San Giacomo again impresses as Roberts'
roommate.

   ``Dead Poets Society'' (Touchstone. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated PG)
   
   ``Dead Poets Society'' was a surprise theatrical hit last year,
winning Academy Award nominations for best picture, actor (Robin
Williams) and Tom Schulman's original screenplay.
   Williams gives a tour de force performance as John Keating, a
highly unorthodox and inspiring English teacher at an affluent New
England prep school in the 1950s. He encourages his students to
take risks and to believe in themselves and all possibilities.
   The real stars are the boys themselves, who revive a secret
literary society, on which the movie hinges.
   This is a fulfilling video, one that will inspire the entire
family.
   Another recent student-teacher video on the market is MGM's
``The Blackboard Jungle.'' This 1955 black and white movie stars
Glenn Ford as a teacher in an inner city school filled with punks
and thugs. A young Sidney Poitier plays a student.
   Here's a brief list of other noteworthy student-teacher videos:
   _``Goodbye, Mr. Chips'' (1939): Robert Donat gives an
Oscar-winning and heartwarming performance as the Latin teacher
Chips. Greer Garson is his wife.
   _``Cheers for Miss Bishop'' (1941): A warm and touching story in
the tradition of ``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.'' The movie Stars Martha
Scott as a Midwestern schoolteacher who devotes her entire life to
teaching.
   _``The Corn Is Green'' (1945): Bette Davis stars as a school
teacher who tries to help a young miner win a scholarship.
   _``Tom Brown's Schooldays'' (1950): Life at a boys school during
Victorian England. Robert Newton is wonderful. Cedric Hardwicke and
Freddie Bartholomew star in an earlier version (1940) titled ``Tom
Brown's School Days.'' Limp compared to 1950 film, and filled with
Hollywood cliches.
   _``Up the Down Staircase'' (1967): Sandy Dennis as a ditsy
teacher in a New York City high school.
   _``To Sir With Love'' (1967): Sidney Poitier woos and wins over
a bunch of trashy punks in London's East End.
   _``Children of a Lesser God'' (1986): An Academy Award-winning
performance by Marlee Matlin as a deaf woman who falls in love with
her teacher.
   _``Stand and Deliver'' (1988): Edward James Olmos was nominated
for an Oscar for his portrayal of Jaime Escalante, who led his
inner city math students to victory with the Advanced Placement
test in calculus.
   _``The Chocolate War'' (1989): A student takes on a secret
society at his Roman Catholic high school and his sadistic teacher.

   ``Blue Sky Mining'' (CBS) _ Midnight Oil
   
   ``Blue Sky Mining'' represents an important moment in the career
of Midnight Oil. The record is a chance for the Australian band to
consolidate gains made with its last release, the U.S. breakthrough
``Diesel and Dust,'' in 1987.
   So what does Midnight Oil decide to sing about? The environment,
malaise, world unity _ obvious choices at a time when socially
conscious rock is a fad.
   Except that Midnight Oil has addressed such subjects for years;
the band has always been more interested in making a point than
making a buck. The point on ``Blue Sky Mining'' is that the world's
a mess, if anyone cares.
   Often that message is eloquently stated by lead singer-social
activist Peter Garrett. Two of the best cuts, ``River Runs Red''
and ``Blue Sky Mine,'' lament that man takes from the land but
rarely puts anything back. ``Nothing's as precious as a hole in the
ground,'' Garrett brays sarcastically in the latter.
   ``Forgotten Years,'' a variation on Billy Joel's ``We Didn't
Start the Fire,'' assesses the current generation's place in
history and concludes that it's time to give a damn. ``The
desperate and divided years, these should not be forgotten years,''
Garrett sings.
   The final tracks, ``One Country'' and the wryly titled
``Antarctica,'' punctuate the record with two exclamation marks.
The former is a plea for global harmony, the latter a plea for a
place not yet fouled by mankind.
   Musically, the group is more restrained than in the past. For
Garrett, the approach makes his words more evocative than ever. But
the muted sound, which includes strings on much of Side 2, robs the
rest of the band of some of its wallop.
   While ace guitarists Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey are
occasionally set loose _ the introduction to ``River Runs Red'' is
glorious _ such instrumental peaks are frustratingly few. It's
ironic that on an album so concerned about natural resources,
Midnight Oil wastes some of its own.

   Tafelmusik, by Georg Philipp Telemann (Archiv) _ Musica Antiqua
Koln, directed by Reinhard Goebel
   
   If it's been said that Vivaldi wrote the same concerto hundreds
of times, the saying also goes that Telemann wrote hundreds of
concertos once. Or maybe it's the other way around.
   Anyway, this amazingly prolific contemporary of Bach and Handel
composed more than 3,000 pieces, a bounty for the Telemann fan and
a distinctly uninteresting fact for those who prefer Mozart,
Beethoven or Brahms.
   As the fine liner notes in this typically handsome Archiv
package point out, Tafelmusik, or Banquet Music, was not strictly
intended as background for meals (though the modern CD-owner with a
neutral attitude to Telemann may indeed put it to that use).
Telemann wrote these pieces for sale to subscribers as a complete
set.
   Scored for small groups of strings with, variously, flutes,
recorder, oboes or trumpets, the works are divided into three
parts. Each part is subdivided into five multimovement sections:
suite, quartet, concert, trio and solo, followed by a conclusion.
Tafelmusik is sort of like Telemann's Ring cycle.
   The sections are often performed or recorded separately. Archiv
does a good service by issuing them complete in four discs,
totaling more than four hours. The casual listener has the benefit
of an excellent sample of Telemann's work, and the connoisseur has
a complete version of one of Telemann's finest compositions.
   The performance is impeccable. In fact, too impeccable. The
musicians, playing period instruments, are overly polite in their
interpretation. The flutes, albeit not modern instruments, have a
timid, almost boring sound. Some quite expressive playing, though,
comes from the violins. The harpsichord continuo often overbalances
the other instruments.

   Columbia University is opening the first public gallery in New
York devoted exclusively to architecture.
   The gallery space in Buell Hall, which was constructed in 1876,
consists of 4,100 square feet. The building also houses the School
of Architecture.
   The first exhibition in the new gallery opens April 4 and runs
through May 11. ``The Filter of Reason: Work of Paul Nelson,''
focuses on the work of the American architect, movie set designer,
painter and critic who taught and practiced architecture in the
United States and France for more than 50 years.
   Nelson helped develop functionalism in the 1930s and '40s, a
movement that rejected beaux-arts traditionalism.
   Elsewhere, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum has received an
unrestricted gift of $5 million from Akira Tobishima, president and
chief executive officer of Tobishima Corp., an international
engineering and construction company based in Tokyo.

<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a little over a year in
1888-89, Vincent van Gogh painted with a passionate frenzy,
producing about 200 oils and 100 drawings.
   From this creative compulsion emerged some of the most popular
works of art ever, van Gogh's vibrantly colored sunflowers, fishing
boats and country scenes.
   A blockbuster exhibit of his most famous artworks is the
centerpiece of a four-month extravaganza commemorating the 100th
anniversary of the Dutch impressionist's death. More than 380 van
Gogh paintings and drawings, insured for a record $3.1 billion, are
on display in two Dutch museums.
   They include ``Self Portrait With Bandaged Ear,'' ``Starry
Night'' and ``Night Cafe,'' as well as dozens of drawings so
vulnerable to light that they have never been shown in public,
according to the event's organizers.
   Along with the exhibit in Amsterdam's Vincent van Gogh Museum
and the Kroeller-Mueller Museum in the central Netherlands town of
Otterlo, the commemorative program includes a dozen other art
exhibitions, an opera and a film festival.
   Commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists, including
Czechoslovak Jiri Kolar, Dutchman Willem de Kooning and American
Roy Lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the $11.5 million
exhibition cost.
   ``Lots of people can relate to van Gogh's artworks because
they're so full of color. But his life fascinates people, too,''
said Madeleine Wardenaar of the Van Gogh 1990 Foundation, which is
organizing the program. ``He's really the romantic artist, with
drama playing a part in every period of his life.''
   Born on March 30, 1853, in the southern Netherlands village of
Zundert, van Gogh struggled with poverty, loneliness and periodic
bouts of madness until he died after firing a rifle into his chest
on July 29, 1890.
   During his troubled life, van Gogh rode an emotional
rollercoaster. After he mutilated himself by removing his ear, he
said the Bible had instructed him to cut off the ``offending
organ.''
   One of his closest relationships was with the French painter
Paul Gauguin, with whom he had an affair. They spent endless hours
arguing.
   Van Gogh also was a voluminous letter writer. During that
444-day period in 1888-89, he wrote about 200 letters.
   In a Sept. 19, 1888, letter to his brother, Theo, van Gogh
describes ``Starry Night'':
   ``The sky is blue-green, the water is royal blue, the soil is
mauve. The city is blue and violet, the gas light yellow. ... On
the blue-green field of the sky the Great Bear, sparkling green and
pink, a reflection whose modest shine contrasts with the powerful
gold of the gas light. Two colorful figures of a lovers' couple on
the foreground.''
   The painting, in which the artist departed from his usual method
of applying small dots of contrasting colors on the cloth to form a
pattern, has bold, linear brush strokes.
   Van Gogh enjoyed considerable acclaim among his fellow artists
during his lifetime, but experts disagree whether he sold three
paintings or just one, according to Wardenaar.
   Today, his works fetch record prices at art auctions around the
globe. His ``Irises'' became the most expensive work ever auctioned
when Sotheby's sold it for $53.90 million on Nov. 11, 1987. The
painting subsequently was sold to the Getty Museum in Malibu,
Calif., after Australian tycoon Alan Bond could not repay a loan
Sotheby's had posted for the sale.
   ``Sunflowers'' went for $39.92 million in March 1987. ``The
Trinquetalle Bridge'' brought $20.24 million in a June 1987 auction.
   The van Gogh exhibit is expected to attract 1.5 million visitors.
   The Amsterdam museum, home of the world's largest van Gogh
collection, will display 135 paintings, including 80 borrowed from
museums and private collections in Paris, London, New York, Boston,
Moscow and Zurich. A total of 248 van Gogh drawings and watercolors
are going on display in the museum in Otterlo, 62 miles from the
Dutch capital.
   Despite the theft in Otterlo of three van Gogh paintings in
1988, the exhibit's organizers had little trouble getting the works
they wanted from foreign lenders, Wardenaar said.
   The stolen paintings, recovered unharmed several months later,
included an early version of van Gogh's famous ``The Potato
Eaters.'' Their total worth was estimated at more than $10.5
million.
   Security during transport and the exhibit itself is expected to
be extremely tight, although no details are being disclosed.
   Wardenaar said the huge insurance package is costing organizers
$2.1 million and will cover only the borrowed artworks. Those owned
by the Dutch museums are uninsured, in line with Culture Ministry
policy.
   The centenary exhibit is organized along the thematic lines that
van Gogh himself described in the hundreds of letters he wrote to
his brother from France, where he lived most of his life.
   ``He said quite explicitly in the letters how he wanted his
paintings displayed,'' Wardenaar said, adding the exhibit will
include some works in several versions in order to illustrate their
development.
   In an April 21, 1888, letter to the painter Emile Bernard, van
Gogh wrote from the southern French city of Arles:
   ``Here's a new `Orchard,' fairly simple in composition: a white
tree, a small green tree, a square bit of green, a purple patch of
soil, an orange roof, a large blue sky. I have nine more `Orchards'
coming: a white, a pink, an almost red, a blue-white, and pink and
gray, a green and a pink one. Yesterday, I botched a cloth: a
`Cherry Tree' against a blue sky, the sprouting leaves were orange
and gold, the flower clusters white: all that against the
blue-green of the sky. It was simply wonderful.''
   Also part of the centenary extravaganza is an opera by the Dutch
composer Jan van Vlijmen, ``Unhappy Man Dressed in Black,'' which
focuses on the final years of the artist's life.
   In the western city of Haarlem, there will be an exhibit of 75
works by the 17th century Dutch master Frans Hals, whom van Gogh
strongly admired, including works on loan from the National Gallery
in Washington and the Royal Academy in London. Several exhibitions
in Amsterdam and elsewhere will illustrate van Gogh's effect on
contemporary artists.
   The van Gogh anniversary also has attracted mass merchandising.
American Express is offering a van Gogh bust by Dutch artist Theo
Melchior. It sells for $490. There also are van Gogh wines,
after-shave lotion, T-shirts, watches and gold-framed prints of his
paintings for $630 each.
   Dutch companies sponsoring the van Gogh centenary are setting up
a ``Van Gogh Village'' to promote their products on Amsterdam's
Museum Square, although Wardenaar said everything was being done to
make the display as dignified as possible.
   The centenary exhibit runs through July 29. Tickets, on sale by
Ticketron in the United States, and available in some European
countries, sell for $12.50 each and must be ordered in advance.
They will give access to one of the museums at a specific time and
date, although visitors can then stay as long as they want.

   Ken Wilkie believes his 18 years of digging for
facts about Vincent van Gogh lights up hitherto dark places in the
life and loves of the world's most popular artist.
   ``I looked in the places no one had bothered with before, like
the telephone book,'' said Wilkie, whose new book about his quest,
``The Van Gogh File,'' was recently published.
   In the Netherlands, museums are busy preparing exhibitions of
paintings and drawings by van Gogh to mark the centennial of the
Dutch artist whose works have become the most expensive in art
history.
   Van Gogh was poor all his life and could not sell his work. But
in eight months in 1987, three paintings by him of irises,
sunflowers and a bridge sold for $114 million.
   At one time, van Gogh's paintings were used for target practice.
Wilkie said he discovered that at St. Remy mental hospital, where
Van Gogh was a voluntary patient in 1889, the son of the doctor in
charge and a friend used the artist's canvasses that he had left
behind as targets for their bows and arrows.
   ``Only much later, when van Gogh became so famous, did they
realize what they had destroyed,'' Wilkie said. He said he was told
of the archery targets by the grandson of van Gogh's guard at the
hospital.
   Wilkie tracked down the man and others connected with van Gogh
through telephone calls in the Netherlands, Belgium, England and
France where the artist lived during his 37 years.
   ``I called people of the same name in the telephone book,'' said
Wilkie, 47, a Scottish journalist from Dundee who lives in
Amsterdam.
   The book revises and updates his first book on the artist in
1978, ``The Van Gogh Assignment,'' which evolved from an article he
was asked to write in 1972.
   His first break in 1972 was a chance meeting with Vincent Willem
van Gogh, then 83, son of the artist's brother, Theo.
   ``Willem was a year old when he was held in the arms of Vincent,
who shot himself two months later,'' Wilkie said. ``All the old
people I spoke to in the first few years are now dead.''
   He listed his most important discoveries as a drawing by van
Gogh of the house in London where he lodged in 1873; a photograph
of Eugenie Loyer, the landlady's daughter who rejected van Gogh's
offer of marriage; and the information out that Vincent and Theo
were both treated for syphilis.
   ``Eugenie's rejection had a profound effect on the course of van
Gogh's immediate life, and the disease explains many curious
actions of the brothers,'' said Wilkie.
   ``Vincent was fired from his job in a London art dealer's after
he began telling the customers what he really thought of the
rubbish on the walls. He then became obsessed with religion and
feelings of compassion for the poor,'' Wilkie said. ``I think the
syphilis was responsible for his schizophrenia and fits, and for
Theo dying paralyzed and insane six months after Vincent.''
   Wilkie said that by going to places where van Gogh had been, he
uncovered things that aren't in art history books.
   ``There are scores of art history books about Van Gogh but they
tend to rely on what other art historians have written,'' he said.
   In south London, at 87 Hackford Road, a blue plaque on a
three-story row house records that Van Gogh lived there in 1873-74.
   Arthur Smith, a retired sanitary inspector who is the current
occupant, said nothing remains of the artist except an old outdoor
toilet that he probably used.
   ``We get film crews and lots of Japanese tourists and we get
nothing for it,'' he said. ``We can't even park the car.''
   ``Do you think I could auction the blue plaque?''

   It's important, Nick Lowe says, for
musicians to have a sense of humor. He's hoping English pop star
Rick Astley feels the same way.
   That's because Astley and his hit song, ``Never Gonna Give You
Up,'' is the subject of a verse on ``All Men Are Liars,'' a cut on
Lowe's new album. Since Lowe rhymes ``Astley'' with ``ghastly,''
it's not exactly a tribute.
   ``I didn't really go after him, I went after this horrible song
that he sang _ `Never going to tell a lie, never going to do
anything horrible to you. I'm always going to be this lump of
jelly, this pathetic creature,''' Lowe said.
   ``They tell me _ I've never met Rick _ that he's a very nice man
and will think this is quite amusing,'' Lowe said. ``I hope so.''
   Lowe's humor _ sometimes perverse, sometimes cornball _ is never
far from the surface. This is a man who's written songs such as
``Time Wounds All Heels'' and ``(Hey Big Mouth) Stand Up and Say
That.'' When David Bowie released an album called ``Low,'' Lowe
retaliated with ``Bowi.''
   Critics, however, accuse Lowe of being glib and not showing
enough care in his craft. For every joke that hits, several fall
flat. After two minor classic albums in the late 1970s, and a hit
single with ``Cruel to Be Kind,'' Lowe's name hasn't been seen on
too many record charts.
   The back cover of Lowe's 1987 ``Pinker and Prouder Than
Previous'' album shows Lowe with his back to a brick wall, gazing
mournfully at an out-of-reach sign that said ``Marketplace.'' Not
many people noticed the irony, since few people bought the record.
   ``I've made some really terrible records,'' Lowe conceded.
``I've done my best, but if you're no good, you're no good. That's
the way it goes.''
   The 40-year-old Liverpool native said he spent much of the last
two years watching television, suffering from a crisis of
confidence.
   ``I went through a pretty desperate time,'' he said. ``My band
packed in. ... I couldn't work out how I fit into the music
business. ... How is it that on paper I'm a washed-up old has-been?
Yet, personally, I feel I haven't started yet?''
   Lowe, who favors country and blues-inflected records that sound
as if they were cut live in the studio, said he watched with dismay
as music became more mechanized through the 1980s. Music by
typists, he called it.
   His first step in a ``comeback'' came when pal Elvis Costello
invited Lowe to be an opening act on a solo acoustic tour. Standing
in front of an audience with just a guitar teaches you quickly
whether a song is working or not, he said. It made him take the
craft of songwriting more seriously, he said.
   And luckily for Lowe, in the audience for a solo show at
London's Mean Fiddler club was an old friend, Warner Bros. Records
executive Andrew Wickham. Lowe's contract with Columbia Records in
the United States had just run out.
   ``It was a tough crowd, a lot of hecklers and drunken
Irishmen,'' Wickham recalled. ``He won them over immediately just
through sheer wit. He held the room, he commanded the room. It's
not many people who can do that. That's one of the main reasons why
I signed him.''
   Lowe quips that he ``sneaked into Warner Bros. on Elvis
Costello's coattails.'' Costello, who's had several of his albums
produced by Lowe, recently switched from Columbia Records to Warner
Bros.
   The 11 compositions on ``Party of One'' are the same frothy pop
confections for which Lowe is known. Despite songs such as ``Jumbo
Ark'' and ``Shting-Shtang,'' Lowe's choice of colleagues shows a
seriousness of purpose he's not always had. Dave Edmunds produced
``Party of One'' and Ry Cooder and Jim Keltner also performed.
   Lowe likes material that is funny, even when it's not overtly
comical. The sneak attack on Astley is not unprecedented. His first
album similarly ridiculed the Bay City Rollers.
   ``I can only do and say what I think,'' he said. ``I'll get up
some people's noses, perhaps, but if I get up some people's noses,
they've really got to be insecure.''
   In the course of a 30-minute interview, he mocks Phil Collins
(``Why doesn't he just get out of the way and let someone else have
a go?''), Richard Marx and Bad English. And Nick Lowe.
   For instance, he said the songs on ``Basher,'' his recent
compilation CD, were chosen by taking a list of all the songs he's
ever recorded and ``crossing out all the ones that under no
circumstances did we want to be reminded of.''
   Commercial success is nice, but he's not willing to sell his
soul for it, Lowe said. It heartens him to see someone whose work
he respects does well, such as when Bonnie Raitt won four Grammy
awards last month.
   ``I spoke to her last week, and she's cool enough not to be cool

   Lowe has no band now, but he's thinking about forming one to

<HEAD>Books and Authors: What's Wrong With Colleges, Professors ...</HEAD>

   The academic world has hardly finished licking
its wounds from Allan Bloom's runaway best seller, ``The Closing of
the American Mind.''
   Bloom's premise, which fit perfectly the college-bashing mood of
the 1980s orchestrated by former U.S. Secretary of Education
William Bennett, held that all was well on U.S. campuses until the
'60s when students began asking rude questions, called ancient
verities mere opinions and even placed Mick Jagger and his ilk
above Bloom's beloved Plato and Aristotle as popular icons.
   Now comes a more radical and even bleaker broadside aimed at
academe, ``Killing the Spirit: Higher Education in America''
(Viking Press, $19.95), by the historian Page Smith.
   No, Smith says, all was not well at U.S. colleges before the
'60s. Any talk of ``the good old days'' simply doesn't jibe with
the history of higher education in this country.
   The crisis afflicting America's campuses is nothing new, writes
Smith. Nor, he admits, are his criticisms.
   He proceeds in this powerful work to add fresh and fascinating
detail to the history of higher education. What we learn is that
from its colonial beginnings to this day, the system has been
fundamentally flawed, fostering in students and teachers alike a
leaden conformity over creativity.
   And in its obeisance to the great god Science, college education
has lost its direction _ and its soul.
   ``I'm not optimistic about piecemeal reforms at this stage,''
Smith said in a telephone interview from his home in Santa Cruz,
Calif., where he writes a syndicated column on old age and is an
emeritus professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz.
   Smith was the founding provost of UC-Santa Cruz and author of
numerous historical works, including an eight-volume history of the
United States.
   He said he was moved to write ``Killing the Spirit'' after he
learned of an aspiring college teacher who almost saw his career
hopes derailed by his academic judges because he invoked the name
of a German historian, Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy, whose ideas were
considered heretical.
   By coincidence, Smith had been initially denied for graduate
work at Harvard 40 years earlier because he had studied under
Rosenstock-Huessy and had similarly invoked that historian's name,
to the chagrin of Harvard's history department.
   It occurred to Smith that colleges were not, and never have
been, the ``marketplaces of ideas'' many believe them to be.
Instead, schools have long practiced what he calls ``academic
fundamentalism,'' meaning woe to any student or teacher with the
courage to stray from the intellectual orthodoxy of the moment.
   ``I thought, my God, can the academic world be that rigid, that
doctrinaire?'' Smith said. Indeed it can, he argues.
   None of academia's sacred cows escapes Smith's critical lance.
The tenure system requires that teachers publish mountains of
useless research. Academic departments are intellectually
stultifying and command a teacher's first loyalty. The lecture
system is simply an unnatural and boring way of transmitting
knowledge. The ``social nonsciences'' and the ``inhuman
humanities,'' as Smith dubs them, have sold their ouls in their
wholly unsuccessful efforts to be viewed as Science with a capital
S.
   He calls anthropology ``arguably the funniest academic
discipline. There is something faintly ridiculous about a sober
white anthropologist asking impertinent questions of quizzical
aborigines and writing down the answers.''
   Of both anthropology and sociology, Smith writes: ``The
treatment of people as objects of scrutiny, scientific or not, is,
when one thinks about it, pretty deplorable. ...''
   Psychology, supposedly the study of the human psyche, the soul,
has denied the existence of the soul as ``unscientific.'' And in
this soul-less state, Smith says psychology has much to answer for:
lobotomies, shock therapy, involuntary drug experimentation and the
perfection of ways to manipulate people into buying things they
don't want or need.
   History, in one of its latest pseudoscientific form, is called
Cliometrics by its practitioners, who feed voting data, property
rolls and the like into computers. One egregious result of such
historical number crunching was a 1974 work, ``Time on the Cross,''
which purported to show with charts and graphs that most American
slaves were happy and that slavery as an institution had merely
gotten a bad press.
   And economics is no more a science than the other social
``nonsciences,'' no matter how hard it contends otherwise. ``It
has, in the final analysis, to deal with human behavior, and human
behavior remains maddeningly unpredictable, fortunately,'' Smith
writes.
   And in a chapter certain to raise feminist hackles, Smith says
women's studies that mushroomed on campuses since the '60s are
clearly out of hand.
   ``The image that women students carry away with them on
graduation must be of a world hopelessly divided into exploiting
males and oppressed females,'' he writes.
   Professors, meanwhile, complain about the ``publish or perish''
system. They also complain about their ``teaching load'' which,
over the years, has grown ever lighter. One wonders what these
seemingly misanthropic souls want besides their sabbaticals.
   Interestingly, Smith singles out community colleges for praise.
Teachers in such schools have a sense of mission and closeness to
their students too often lacking in loftier institutions, he says.
   Smith's book is descriptive, in the manner of the historian. It
is no blueprint for reform. It offers only the broadest
prescription: a belief in smaller, more personal colleges that
somehow reconcile the scientific with the spiritual.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Earl Thomas Conley Likes To Cry</HEAD>

   Country music performer Earl Thomas
Conley says it feels good to get wrapped up in a song and cry.
   And Conley, who's been at the top of the country charts for the
past decade, has broken down a few times on stage and in the
recording studio.
   ``You get so caught up that you are convinced,'' he said in an
interview. ``That's when it's really nice. You are totally relating
to it.''
   His songs about love, yearning and hardships are familiar fare
on the nartion's 2,100 country music radio stations.
   The introspective, philosophical Conley has an impressive 18 No.
1 records to his credit since his first one in 1981, ``Fire and
Ice.'' He has two ``greatest hits'' albums.
   But the 48-year-old performer is not content.
   ``You get lazy when you get satisfied,'' Conley said. ``You're
asleep when you're satisfied. Then you wake up and your career is
over because you are only as strong as the record you have out at
the time.
   ``You can work in this business for five years on what you have
done, but the idea is to pretend you are never going to quit. That
way, you get better with each endeavor. That way you continue to
grow and be refreshing.
   ``And you continue to be totally alive in your music and in your
life period. I think you always need a challenge.''
   Conley was the third of eight children born to a railroad worker
in Portsmouth, Ohio. The family was poor and he wore hand-me-downs.
   He wanted to paint pictures, but gravitated toward country music
while in the Army. Later, he began writing songs during a series of
factory and steel mill jobs in Ohio. During breaks on his job at a
steel mill, he played his guitar in the locker room.
   For a long time, he commuted to Nashville every few months,
trying vainly to generate interest in his work. In 1970, he moved
to Huntsville, Ala., and again worked at manual labor while singing
in nightclubs seven nights a week.
   He finally moved to Nashville in 1973, signed a recording
contract and became a country music favorite singing
thought-provoking songs he wrote himself.
   In 1984, his album ``Don't Make It Easy for Me'' had four No. 1
singles: the title cut, ``Holding Her and Loving You,'' ``Your
Love's on the Line'' and ``Angel in Disguise.''
   His other hit records include ``Somewhere Between Right and
Wrong,'' ``I Have Loved You Girl,'' ``Chance of Loving You,''
``Nobody Falls Like a Fool,'' ``What I'd Say'' and ``Right From the
Start.''
   He's also been successful singing duets, joining Emmylou Harris
on the No. 1 country record ``We Believe in Happy Endings'' in
1988. He also sang a duet with Anita Pointer of the Pointer
Sisters, ``Too Many Times,'' which was the title cut of his 1986
album.
   He said one reason he's done well is because of his attention to
originality.
   ``I always look for new ways of doing things. If I write a
waltz, the next thing I do is as far opposite as I can find. And I
usually don't go back and review my old material or anyone else's.
Instead I look for a new way to do things and new ways of feeling
things,'' he said.
   Despite his steady success, he's rarely received an award for
his music. He's gone largely unnoticed at awards shows while
country performers like Randy Travis, Hank Williams Jr. and George
Strait packed their trophy cases.
   ``It's disappointing,'' Conley said. ``There are other people
doing good things in this industry, but it seems like people turn
their eyes to them (and not me).''
   In the meantime, though, Conley has been fighting a singer's
nightmare: voice trouble. He took 2{ months off the road last fall
because of a strained voice and bronchitis. Early this year he
rescheduled concert dates for six weeks because of a recurrence of
the problem. A biopsy was considered at one point but ruled out as
unnecessary.

<HEAD>NBC, McDonald's Team Up on Promotion for Fall TV Season</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the second consecutive year, the television
ratings leader in prime time is taking on a partner in a promotion
designed to drum up viewers for its new fall season.
   The National Broadcasting Co.'s NBC television network and
McDonald's Corp., the king of fast food, said Monday they would
team up on a game-like promotion this fall that they said would be
the most extensive ever for TV, reaching a potential 60 million
people daily.
   The companies declined to provide details of the effort, saying
they didn't want to give competitors a chance to copy it.
   NBC and CBS each had joint promotions with major retailers last
fall. The networks say they have had to become more aggressive in
getting people to look at their shows because of the growing
competition from independent stations, cable television and
programs and films on videocassettes.
   Last fall, NBC had a joint promotion with Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.,
the nation's largest retailer, that gave viewers a chance to win
trips to Hollywood to be on NBC programs plus other assorted prizes.
   CBS had a joint promotion with K mart Corp. last fall, and may
offer another promotion with the Michigan-based retailer this year,
according to CBS senior vice president George Schweitzer.
   Some advertising executies have questioned the value of such
promotions, but CBS and NBC executives say last year's efforts
boosted awareness of their programs and encouraged more people to
tune in at least once.
   ``Last year's promotion was highly successful for CBS and for K
mart,'' Schweitzer said. He said CBS's ratings for season premieres
last fall were up 28 percent from the previous year, when the start
of the season was delayed by a writer's strike, and 10 percent from
1987, when the season started on time.
   Schweitzer said the promotion also helped K mart post its
biggest sales gain of the year during the three-week period.
   Mary Jean Houde, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Sears, said
Sears felt its promotion with NBC last year brought more customers
into the store even though sales in stores open at least a year
fell 1.8 percent last September compared with the previous year.
   She said the decline in so-called comparable store sales, the
indicator many analysts use to gauge how a retailer is doing,
reflected weakness in appliance and furniture sales rather than any
problem with the promotion.
   She declined to comment on Sears' plans for promotions this
year, but said, ``We don't often repeat a specific promotional
event.''
   NBC and McDonald's said their effort has the potential to reach
many more people every day than either the NBC-Sears or CBS-K mart
promotions did.
   With 209 affiliates, NBC said its schedule of shows can reach 42
million viewers nightly while McDonald's serves 17 million
customers a day at its 8,400 U.S. restaurants.
   John Miller, executive vice president for marketing at NBC-TV,
said last year's promotion with Sears ``did increase sampling
somewhat although not as much as we would have liked.''
   Nonetheless, he said, NBC gained valuable experience that it
hopes to use this year.
   He said about 3 million people entered last year's promotion and
that this year it was hoped ``considerably more, maybe a million a
day'' would enter.
   McDonald's has conducted a number of promotions itself in recent
years, including games based on the board games Monopoly and
Scrabble and giveaways linked to the movies ``The Little Mermaid''
and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.''

   AT&amp;T has entered the crowded credit card
business with Mastercard and Visa cards that promise no annual fees
and offer a discount on long-distance calls.
   The AT&amp;T Universal Card can be used to charge long-distance
phone calls on the company's telephone network as well as the
traditional goods and services billed to charge cards.
   The phone giant kicked off an advertising blitz during Monday
night's Academy Awards broadcast to highlight some of the card's
features, including:
   _No annual fee ever for customers who sign up his year and make
at least one purchase annually.
   _Rental-car insurance, purchase protection and extended product
warranties, which usually are provided exclusively with ``gold''
bank credit cards aimed at high-income customers.
   _A 10 percent discount from the regular credit-card rate on
phone calls charged to the card.
   The card carries an annual interest rate of 8.9 percentage
points above the prime rate, which currently is 10 percent. Credit
card and phone call charges will appear on the same bill.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. officials said the card would
be offered to those of its 70 million long-distance phone
subscribers who pass credit checks.
   For customers who choose it, the Universal Card will supplant
the existing AT&amp;T phone card, which only can be used to charge
calls. About 40 million phone cards are in circulation.
   Some industry analysts praised the move by the nation's largest
long-distance phone company.
   ``You've got a company with a very well-known name and already
in the wallets of a lot of people trying to expand that wallet
share into the most profitable segment of financial services,''
said Mark Lynch, who follows the banking industry for Bear Stearns
&amp; Co.
   But Spencer Nilson, publisher of a trade letter on the credit
card industry, said AT&amp;T would have a hard time making a profit
without charging an annual fee.
   Nilson said he believed the move was motivated more by AT&amp;T's
need to hang on to its long-distance customers, who increasingly
are being lured away by MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint, the
No. 2 and 3 long-distance carriers.
   From this perspective, Nilson called the credit cards ``a very
smart move.''
   In December, US Sprint began issuing a Sprint Visa Card that
also acts as a phone charge card. The card carries a $25 annual
fee. The company said its motivation was to increase the use of its
phone network.
   MCI has said it has no plans to issue credit cards.
   AT&amp;T will issue its cards through Universal Bank, a subsidiary
of Synovus Financial Corp., a bank holding company based in
Columbus, Ga. Total System Services Inc., a credit card service
company controlled by Synovus, will process the transactions from
the cards.
   Under its agreement with Synovus, AT&amp;T will share profits and
buy card receivables, the money owed from customer charges.
Receivables frequently are bundled into securities that are traded
like bonds on Wall Street.
   AT&amp;T also has the right to buy up to 1.5 million newly issued
shares of Total System Services stock. The company has 15.9 million
shares outstanding.
   To run the credit card operation, AT&amp;T hired scores of credit
card industry veterans, including Paul Kahn, former head of First
Chicago Corp.'s card division, who will run the new division.
   AT&amp;T originally considered issuing its own credit card to
compete with MasterCard and Visa, but backed out after market
research showed consumers wanted to consolidate their cards rather
than have another one, Kahn told reporters at a news conference.
   Industry analysts said fierce competition in the credit-card
industry also may have dissuaded AT&amp;T from the plan.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s Discover Card was the last separate
card to break into the industry, and the retailer endured several
years of steep losses before it turned the operation around.
   Alex W. Hart, president and chief executive officer of

away from other issuers of MasterCard and Visa. However, he said,
the AT&amp;T card should expand the overall market share for those

<HEAD>Wang Plans Future After Founder's Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Finding a successor to its late founder, An Wang,
should not be as difficult for Wang Laboratories Inc. as it may be
for the company to rebound from recent losses and regain customer
confidence.
   The board of directors of the Lowell-based company is scheduled
to meet Wednesday to discuss who will succeed Wang as chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Wang, who struggled against cancer for months, died Saturday at
age 70.
   But while the company has struggled recently, analysts said the
company already made an important leadership change last year when
it named Richard Miller as president. Miller took the job from
Wang's son, Frederick Wang, who was ousted after the company's
fortunes tumbled.
   Analysts expect Miller to take the CEO job and possibly ascend
to chairman.
   In a statement after his father's death, Frederick Wang said on
behalf of his family, ``We support Rick Miller and the other
members of the Wang management team in their efforts to build a
strong and growing company.''
   The statement said the family ``believes that the long-term plan
now being implemented to return the company to profitability will
achieve its objectives.''
   Under the leadership of the company's founder, Wang became a
multibillion-dollar company, largely as a pioneer in word
processors. But analysts said the company stumbled when it failed
to react quickly to the growth in personal computers, which largely
replaced the need for word processors.
   The company moved into the mid-range computer market, but that
segment has been slumping, and Wang posted a $424.3 million loss
for the year that ended last June 30.
   Since Miller, a former General Electric Co. executive, took over
in August, he slashed the work force and sold off assets to reduce
the company's debt.
   Wang now employs about 22,500 people, compared with 28,000 at
the end of the last fiscal year. Its bank debt has shrunk from $575
million to under $100 million.
   Also under Miller, Wang has moved out of its ``closed,'' or
proprietary, products and said it will make more equipment that
uses increasingly popular industrywide standards. This strategy is
part of Miller's plan to make Wang more responsive to customer
needs.
   ``I think the big changes have already occurred,'' said Fred
Pastore, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. ``I think we
will see a much more focused Wang.''
   ``Wang has made the kind of moves the company needs to make to
survive,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst at the research firm
Gartner Group Inc.
   Wang is becoming better aligned with the market, Wendler said,
but Miller still must solve the company's poor history of customer
service that has left many clients unhappy.
   While some analysts speculate that Wang could become a takeover
target, Wendler described the customer service as an ``Achilles
heel'' that could dissuade potential suitors.
   ``Wang has a large installed base, but it's an unhappy installed
base,'' Wendler said. ``If you're an investor, you look at it like
damaged goods.
   ``The long term for Wang is still very cloudy,'' he said.
   In the company statement, the Wang family said it ``intends to
retain their ownership position'' in the company. The family
effectively has control over the company, with the power to elect
three-quarters of the board of directors.
   Part of Wang's long-term strategy is to concentrate on image
processing, in which computers store and manipulate the actual
images of documents. Analysts say the market for image processing
is expected to grow to $3 billion annually in the next few years.

<HEAD>Gillette Says It Won't Acquire Wilkinson U.S. Business in
Antitrust Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials say they are protecting
competition by blocking Gillette Co. from acquiring the Wilkinson
blade and razor business in the United States.
   Gillette officials say the federal action is not a serious
setback, insisting their main interest is in Wilkinson's business
in other parts of the world.
   Gillette and the U.S. Justice Department announced a settlement
Monday in which Gillette dropped its plans to acquire the U.S.
razor business of Wilkinson.
   The action follows statements last year by Bush administration
officials that the government intends to promote competition
through tighter enforcement of antitrust laws.
   Gillette, the world leader in the razor industry, announced in
December it was helping finance a buyout of Wilkinson's Swedish
owner. Under the deal, Gillette said it would acquire the Wilkinson
blade and razor business outside of Europe.
   Gillette also said it would gain nonvoting interest in the newly
created Netherlands company, Eemland Management Services BV, which
would retain the European Wilkinson business as well as worldwide
match and lighter operations.
   But the Justice Department filed an antitrust suit in January,
saying the deal could reduce competition in the United States and
hurt consumers.
   Gillette officials said that after the suit was filed, the
company indicated it would not acquire the Wilkinson U.S. business,
and under the settlement, Gillette agreed not to do so in the
future.
   ``We felt it did not violate the antitrust law. We still feel it
doesn't,'' said David Fausch, a Gillette spokesman. But he said
Gillette did not consider Wilkinson's U.S. business large enough to
justify a lengthy and costly court case.
   Gillette said the settlement would not affect any other aspect
of the transaction. Wilkinson's U.S. business will remain under the
control of the Netherlands company, Fausch said.
   ``The proposed final judgment would permit Wilkinson Sword to
remain an efficient and independent competitor in the United States
market,'' James F. Rill, assistant U.S. attorney general, said in a
statement.
   Under the proposed settlement, which must be approved in court,
Gillette also would be prevented from acquiring Wilkinson's
production facilities in Europe that are used to supply the United
States.
   The agreement also would bar Eemland from transferring
trademarks to Gillette for blades sold in the United States or
Europe. Furthermore, it would prohibit Gillette from acting as
Eemland's agent for the U.S. razor market, and would prevent
Gillette from acquiring more equity in Eemland, the government said.
   Gillette said its ``principal purpose was to develop the global
potential of the Wilkinson brand outside the European Community and
the United States.''
   Brenda Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said
the action should not be a big setback to Gillette, noting that
Wilkinson represents about 3 percent of the U.S. razor market.
   ``The U.S. is peanut business,'' she said.

<HEAD>Firing Raises Questions on Investment Advice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The firing of a securities analyst who had
criticized Donald Trump's newest casino project shows that
brokerages sometimes face pressures to provide less than objective
investment advice, industry observers said.
   Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. confirmed Monday it had terminated
Marvin Roffman in the wake of negative comments he made to The Wall
Street Journal about the Taj Mahal Casino Resort in Atlantic City,
N.J.
   ``This should make the individual investor more skeptical about
Wall Street research,'' said James J. Cramer, president of Cramer &amp;
Co., an investment management firm in New York.
   ``Most people think analysts are independent, understand their
industries and do tough analysis,'' Cramer said. ``It's just not
true. Most analysts can't afford to be independent.''
   Janney Montgomery said Roffman was fired for violating company
policies, not because of his negative public comments about the Taj
Mahal.
   Nevertheless, Cramer said Roffman's situation would serve as a
warning to other analysts that they have to recommend the stocks
their firm wants to recommend, regardless of their own conclusions.
Some others agreed.
   ``Wall Street (firms) are such idiots about not telling
investors bad news,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of the Overprice
Stock Service newsletter in San Francisco. ``They will only tell
investors good news.''
   He said Janney Montgomery ``made a dumb decision,'' and his own
firm agreed with Roffman that the Taj Mahal will open at a time
when the gaming industry has overcapacity.
   ``By firing the guy who has thought about this, done his
homework, come to a conclusion and put it out there, they're really
interfering in the efficiency of the capital markets,'' Murphy said.
   Robert Sobel, a professor of business history at Hofstra
University in Hempstead, N.Y., said similar actions have been taken
against analysts and stockbrokers before, but they usually have not
been disclosed publicly.
   ``This is not going to burnish Donald Trump's image, or the
company's,'' Sobel said. ``If I had an account with that company,
I'd leave. I couldn't trust their research.''
   But Andrew Gray III, president of the New York Society of
Security Analysts, said Roffman's firing was an aberration, if a
bad one.
   ``It sort of defeats the purpose of paying someone to determine
whether a vehicle is a good investment, or a bad, or something in
between,'' he said.
   Trump has issued $675 million in mortgage bonds to finance the
Taj Mahal, which would have to gross $1 million daily to cover
interest costs and operating expenses.
   The Journal quoted Roffman in its March 20 editions as saying
the casino initially would flourish, but ``once the cold winds blow
from October to February, it won't make it. The market just isn't
there.''
   Trump demanded Roffman issue a letter of public apology. Janney
Montgomery ordered the analyst do so, to take a pay cut and to stop
talking to reporters, according to Roffman.
   Roffman said he initially signed a letter seeking Trump's
forgiveness for ``what has turned out to be a very unfortunate
interview on my part.'' But he retracted that statement in a second
letter, saying he signed the first letter under ``extremely
stressful'' conditions.
   Trump said Monday that Janney Montgomery fired Roffman of its
own volition.
   Norman T. Wilde Jr., president of Janney Montgomery, issued a
statement Monday saying Roffman was fired because he had been
advised in writing not to send his second letter.
   Roffman violated Janney Montgomery policies in making comments
to the news media about the Taj Mahal before clearing them with top
company officials and by not disseminating the recommendations
broadly to the firm's clients first, Wilde said.
   ``Mr. Roffman was well aware of these policies and had been
admonished in the past on more than one occasion to follow those
policies,'' Wilde said.
   Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., has 1,050 employees and 40
offices.
   Roffman said he had received dozens of telephone calls of
support from around the country.
   ``Everyone's saying, `we support you 100 percent in what you're
doing. If an analyst does research and comes out with a negative
opinion, there's no reason he should be silenced,''' Roffman said.
   Asked if were considering a lawsuit against his former employer,
Roffman said: ``I have an attorney, and it is one of our options.''

<HEAD>Italian Marble Covering Amoco Building to Be Turned Into Rubble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michelango used it to create masterpieces, and it
helped make the world's fifth-largest building a landmark. But the
Italian marble covering the Amoco Building appears destined for
doom.
   Despite hundreds of offers to use the 16 acres of Carrara marble
covering the building for items such as pen holders and pool decks,
Amoco Oil Co. officials say it likely will be turned into rubble
starting this May.
   That's when workers are scheduled to begin removing the 43,000
marble panels that form the facade of the majestic white building
and replacing them with granite as a safety precaution.
   Offers to save the marble proved too costly and raised liability
questions, said company officials, who are considering either
tossing the marble into a landfill or breaking it up into gravel.
   ``We're down to those final two'' options, Amoco spokesman Mike
Thompson said Monday.
   The marble covers the 1,136-foot downtown building in 45-inch
long panels about 1{-inch thick, each weighing 275 pounds. That
amounts to 5,900 tons of glossy white marble, which helped make the
17-year-old building a distinctive landmark among the city's
skyscrapers.
   But planners didn't foresee the effects of Chicago's mercurial
weather on the panels, which have warped and fractured in the
deep-freeze of winter and summer's scorching sun.
   Michelangelo used the same type of marble, quarried in the
Carrara Mountains of north-central Italy, but he ``didn't leave his
work outside,'' Chicago architect Walter Netsch once noted.
   Fearing that the panels could come loose and turn into deadly
projectiles, Amoco announced a year ago that they were being
removed and replaced with granite.
   ``Everybody I've talked to says it's such a shame,'' said Paul
Peterson, one of hundreds of people whose offers were rejected by
Amoco. Peterson, a Chicago attorney and former artist, had tried to
persuade Amoco to donate the stone veneer to a venture using
handicapped people to make marble mementos.
   Another offer came from a homeowner ``who wanted to see if he
could get some marble for a pool-decking,'' Thompson said. But the
marble is super slick when wet, and Amoco didn't want to be held
responsible for any accidents.
   ``There's serious liability questions here,'' Thompson said.
   It has taken a year to prepare the building for the removal,
which will cost between $60 million and $80 million, Thompson said.
The company expects all the marble to be gone and the granite in
place by the middle of 1992.
   Though salt-and-pepper colored up close, the granite appears
white from afar and will maintain the building's distinctive
appearance, Amoco officials say.
   The offers to make use of the marble came from schools, churches
and even the city's park district, which proposed using the stone
to build a facade along the Chicago River, Peterson said.
   Cost made most of the offers prohibitive, said Shelby Pierce,
engineering manager of the Amoco Oil. Co. subsidiary and
coordinator of the removal project.
   During the removal, ``if the contractor is instructed to keep
(the marble) intact and try to avoid breaking it, we're going to
have to pay a premium on it,'' he said.
   The contractors ``would like to break it in the middle'' to
facilitate the removal, ``but that would destroy the marble for any
other use,'' Pierce said.
   Peterson is not convinced that Amoco has explored all the
options for the marble, and said he's encouraging others to come up
with suggestions for the stuff.
   But Amoco officials say the case is closed.
   ``It's unfortunate,'' Pierce said, ``but we'll be glad to get
the granite up.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Default Judgement Entered Against Antar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a default
judgment entered against Eddie Antar after the fugitive
entrepreneur failed for a fourth time to appear in court on insider
trading charges.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleges that Antar,
founder of the now-defunct Crazy Eddie's discount electronics
chain, reaped $60 million in profits by overstating the value of
his company and selling stock based on false information about the
company's financial soundness.
   The default judgment ordered Monday by U.S. District Court Judge
Nicolas H. Politan paves the way for fines and recovery of money
earmarked for distribution to allegedly defrauded investors.
   Penalties would be decided after a trial of three other top
Crazy Eddie officials, including Antar's cousin and brother, also
charged in the SEC case.
   The SEC has asked that a special judicial request be made to
Israeli authorities to facilitate the return of $52 million the
agency says Antar deposited in Bank Leumi, a Tel Aviv-based bank.
   Antar missed a court date on March 16 after already being found
in contempt of court for missing previous scheduled appearances
before U.S. Magistrate Ronald Hedges. Hedges then sent the matter
to Politan.
   Antar's defense attorneys requested and were granted the right
to drop out of the case after Antar missed the March 16 date.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most major foreign
currencies in early European trading today.
   Gold prices were mixed, but dealers said the markets were
recovering following Monday's record drop.
   Dealers predicted little action for the dollar, saying it was
caught in a narrow range. The U.S. currency was supported by
tensions in Soviet Lithuania but blocked from rising too far by
fear of central bank intervention, traders said.
   ``When we move higher, the central banks could come into play,''
said a trader at a French bank in Frankfurt.
   However, Graham Ritson, chief dealer at the Bank of Montreal in
London said he was not worried about market intervention yet.
   Another Frankfurt dealer, at a European bank, said he expected
news from the German monetary union and reunification to make
headlines and affect the markets again within the next few days.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.56 yen to a closing 156.97 yen. Later, in London,
it was unchanged.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.7120 West German marks, down from 1.7155;
1.5213 Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 5.7617 French francs, down
from 5.7745; 1.9230 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9267; 1,258.50
Italian lire, down from 1,261.50; and 1.1770 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1748.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6165, compared with $1.6135 late Monday.
   Gold dealers said the markets were licking their wounds after
what they said was the sharpest single-day drop in recent memory.
   ``There's a bit of consolidation going on,'' said one London
broker. ``I think the dealers are still trying to sort through
their books after Monday's action. It definitely isn't a hectic
market right now.''
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $367.40 a troy ounce,
down from $368.50 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $369.75.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $369.50, up from $363 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $12.47 to close at a bid
$372.47.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $4.96 a troy ounce, from
Monday's $4.94.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's chief index closed
marginally lower today after making up most early losses, while the
dollar rose against the yen despite selling by the Bank of Japan
and by profit-takers, traders said.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 14.53 points, or 0.05
percent, ending the day at 31,825.96.
   In the afternoon, the index fluctuated wildly after losing
nearly 350 points in the morning. The yen continued to weaken
against the dollar.
   The Nikkei index's marginal loss came after a see-saw game
between index-related arbitrage buying and profit-taking following
the market's large rise Monday, said Kazuyoshi Suzuki, a dealer
with Daiwa Securities Co.
   On Monday, the index rose 1,468.33 points, or 4.83 percent, in
its second-largest single-day gain ever. Its largest gain was on
Oct. 21, 1987, when it rebounded 2,037.32 points from the worldwide
``Black Monday'' crash.
   On March 19 the index dived 1,353.20 points to begin a three-day
plunge that took it below the 30,000-point level before it began
rebounding last Friday.
   Suzuki said a bullish mood was growing gradually among investors
because today was the first day of the new fiscal for stock
trading. Japan's fiscal year begins April 1, but the new month for
registering stock transactions starts four days prior to the
calendar date.
   ``The market has definitely bottomed out. After the year-end
account settlement, companies no longer have a desperate reason to
sell stocks,'' he said. ``Spring has come to the stock market.''
   Trading was moderate, with the volume on the market's first
section estimated at 700 million shares, unchanged from Monday.
   In currency trading, the dollar closed at 156.96 yen, up 0.56
yen from Monday's 156.40-yen finish. The U.S. currency opened at
156.90 yen and ranged between 156.80 yen and 157.20 yen during the
day.
   Many market players, except for those who needed to buy dollars
for year-end account settlements, remained on the sidelines, said
Chizuko Satsukawa, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told a post-Cabinet meeting
news conference today events in Lithuania were greatly influencing
exchange-rate movements, and called the current dollar-yen exchange
rate ``a headache.''
   He said he was continuing to watch foreign exchange market
movements with concern.
   Traders said the central bank sold the dollar actively in the
morning to slow its rise against the yen, but the amount sold was
not immediately available. The Bank of Japan does not normally
comment on its market interventions.
   The dollar slowed its rise in the afternoon as market players
bought the yen against the West German mark, Ms. Satsukawa said.
   ``The yen is the only one constantly weakening against all the
other major currencies. And this trend is unlikely to change,'' she
said.
   Toru Kanai, a currency analyst with New Japan Securities Co.,
said, ``Unless the United States shows a clear position on an
appropriate dollar level, the dollar won't stop rising.''
   Kanai said market players also sold the dollar for profit-taking
whenever the currency approached the 157-yen level.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond
closed at 86.03 points, down from Monday's close at 86.86. Its
yield rose to 7.345 percent from 7.170 percent.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in the latest auction to their lowest level in
several weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills
Monday at an average discount rate of 7.85 percent, down from 7.97
percent last week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.83 percent, down from 7.92 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.72
percent on Feb. 26, and six-month bills averaged 7.79 percent on
March 5. Three-month bills equaled the 7.85 percent rate on March 5.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.12 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,801.60 and 8.26 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,604.20.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-yer Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.35
percent last week, down from 8.42 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>BAT To Sell Breuner Stores for $92.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC said Tuesday it would sell its
18 John Breuner Co. furniture stores to Prism Capital Corp., a
merchant bank in New York, for $92.5 million in cash.
   The deal is to be completed in about two months through BATUS
Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of BAT, the conglomerate said.
   Breuners, which is based in San Ramon, California, was bought by
BAT in 1982.
   The sale is one step in BAT's strategy of focusing on its
tobacco and financial services businesses to fight off a 13.4
billion-pound, or $22 billion, hostile takeover offer from Hoylake
Investments Ltd., an investor group led by Anglo-French financier
Sir James Goldsmith.
   Part of this restructuring includes the sale of all BAT's retail
operations in the United States.
   The others to be sold include Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall
Field's, Ivey's and Breuners' furniture rental business. The
conglomerate said it hopes to have all the sales completed by the
middle of this year.
   Prism was founded last year by Dennis and Steven Wong, who have
backgrounds in merchant banking, venture capital and real estate,
BAT said.
   Prism also owns a controlling interest in Barker Bros. Co., a
chain of 11 high-quality furniture stores in Southern California,
BAT said.
   Prism intends to operate the two retailers independently, it
said.
   The combined annual revenue of Breuners and Barker exceed $200
million, BAT said.

   ``It is exactly 10 years since my appointment as chairman of
Jaguar and during that time I have concentrated on the rescue and
recovery of a fine British car company,'' Egan said.
   He said he had been delighted that Ford had acquired Jaguar and
was encouraged by Ford's ambitious long-term plans. Ford plans to
substantially increase Jaguar's annual production of 50,000.
   ``I consider I have made my best contribution to Jaguar and my
advice to Ford was that the big growth opportunities available to
Jaguar under their ownership could only be fully exploited if the
company was led by a senior Ford executive,'' he said.
   Egan has been credited with steering the auto maker through a
successful privatization in 1984 and improving the company's
fortunes.
   He had wanted to retain Jaguar's independence and had discussed
possible cooperation deals with many car makers.
   In the government's hands, Jaguar had developed a poor
reputation for quality and reliability, and sales had suffered
worldwide, particularly in the United States.

<HEAD>Government Refers British Airways Plan to Monopolies Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Tuesday referred British Airways
PLC's purchase of a 20 percent stake in Sabena World Airlines to
the monopolies commission for a review of its impact on air service
to and from Britain.
   The referral, made by the Department of Trade and Industry on
the recommendation of Britain's Office of Fair Trading, puts at
risk a major strategic move by British Airways.
   The airline had hoped to use the tie with Belgium's Sabena SA to
create an additional hub for its European and trans-Atlantic
flights.
   European airlines have been scrambling to form links with each
other and with U.S. and Asian airlines to better compete as the air
travel industry becomes increasingly global and deregulated. These
links have raised concerns about their effects on competition.
   The trade department said the commission's investigation would
not involve the 20 percent Sabena stake bought by KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines at the same time the British Airways link was agreed to in
December.
   British Airways and KLM each are paying the equivalent of $57
million for their Sabena stakes. The remaining 60 percent stake is
to be held by the government-controlled Sabena.
   The department asked the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to
complete the investigation by June 28.
   British Airways Chairman Lord King said he was disappointed by
the referral, but added that he had ``every confidence that the MMC
will conclude its report in our favor.''
   King said the deal would expand existing services, increase
customer choice and produce long-term benefits for the consumer.
   Although the newly formed airline was scheduled to have been
launched at the beginning of this year, a British Airways spokesman
said a further lag would be of no real consequence.
   The spokesman wasn't identified, in accordance with British
custom.
   British Airways also is waiting for a ruling by the European
Commission, which is looking into whether the venture is
anti-competitive.

<TEXT>
   Japanese legislators, meeting with U.S. officials
Tuesday, balked at American demands that they enact broad economic
reforms to help shrink the U.S. deficit in trade with Japan.
   Japanese members of the Japan-U.S. Parliamentarians League told
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Michael Armacost and other U.S. Embassy
officials that reform of Japan's land-use policies and its retail
distribution system would be difficult to achieve quickly,
lawmakers attending the breakfast meeting said.
   At Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's request, the Japanese
government has drawn up proposals aimed at meeting U.S. requests
made in trade talks called the ``Structural Impediments
Initiative.''
   In remarks to Parliament, Japanese officials have said the
reforms should be undertaken for the sake of Japanese consumers.
   But other leaders of the governing Liberal Democratic Party are
less conciliatory, said LDP lawmaker Takujiro Hamada, who chaired
the meeting.
   ``The parliamentarians said that resistance to the reforms was
very strong in their constituencies and that it would take a long
time to carry out the reforms suggested by the United States in the
trade talks,'' Hamada said.
   ``The opinions expressed by the Japanese legislators were rather
severe,'' said Ichiji Ishii, another Liberal Democratic lawmaker.
   ``They said the `menu' of U.S. demands was much too big,'' said
Ishii, referring to reports that Washington has given Japan a list
of more than 200 suggestions aimed at eliminating structural
barriers it said prevent foreign companies from entering Japanese
markets.
   U.S. officials attending Tuesday's meeting had nothing to add to
the account given by Hamada and Ishii.
   The United States contends that high land prices and
inefficiencies in and restrictions on the distribution system make
it harder for foreign businesses to enter the Japanese market.
Japan says problems on the U.S. side also contribute to the trade
imbalance.
   In the latest round of trade talks last week, the Japanese side
suggested the United States tax more, wean itself from
energy-wasting cars and limit the use of credit cards, the mass
circulation newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun reported.
   The suggestions were among 80 proposals for cutting the federal
budget deficit, increasing savings and investment and improving
worker training and education to boost the competitiveness of
American exports, it said.
   The legislators, who eventually will vote on some of the
government's reform plans, also argued that a reduction in Japan's
$49 billion trade surplus with the United States could be better
carried out through other approaches, including ``managed trade,''
or export-oriented industrial policies, Hamada said.
   He said former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, widely seen as a
likely candidate for prime minister, stressed during the meeting
that charges that Japan had done nothing to resolve the trade
imbalance were absolutely wrong.
   ``It seems almost as if Japan is being scolded for having such a
powerful, competitive economy,'' Hamada said.
   Each nation is to come up with an interim report on the SII
talks in early April. A final report is expected in July.

   The stock market was drifting at slightly lower
levels in early trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.06 points to
2,703.60 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Declining issues outpaced advancers by a margin of about 5 to 4
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 491 issues down, 393 up and
526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.93 million shares.
   Analysts said the market appeared uninspired in early dealings
following Monday's lackluster session when Big Board volume
recorded the second slowest day on Wall Street this year.
   ``There's not much going on today. Looks like it could be
another quiet day,'' said Hildegarde Zagorski, equities analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Analysts said would-be participants were continuing to hold
back, reflecting some nervousness about possible disappointing
first-quarter corporate earnings as well as concern about Monday's
plunge in precious metals prices.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
off 0.16 at 185.44.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was down
0.20 at 361.11.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average posted a 3.38 gain to
2,707.66.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 829 up, 652 down and 487 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 116.11 million shares, down from 132.07
million in the previous session. The last slower day this year was
on March 12 when volume on the exchange was 114.8 million shares.

<HEAD>Japanese Split Over U.S. Trade Criticism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese people questioned in a nationwide poll
released Thursday were almost evenly split about whether U.S.
criticism of Japan's trade policy is reasonable.
   The financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun said 47.4 percent
of the 6,186 people who responded to the survey said they view U.S.
trade complaints as basically reasonable.
   This included 9 percent who said they completely agree with the
criticisms and 38.4 percent who replied that ``the U.S. claims are
basically right although there are a few points that seem
unreasonable,'' the newspaper said.
   Another 32.9 percent of the respondents said the criticism was
unreasonable, with an additional 6.6 percent saying the criticism
was completely unreasonable.
   Another 13.1 percent said they could not say if the criticism
was reasonable, or did not know.
   Sixty-three percent of the respondents said Japan should open
its rice market at least partially to allow the sale of foreign
rice ``despite government attempts to keep Japan's rice market
closed,'' the newspaper said.
   It said a minority of 31.1 percent said absolutely no foreign
rice should be allowed into Japan.
   ``The government's zero-import policy ... is not getting firm
public support,'' the newspaper commented.
   In current trade talks, the United States has asked Japan to
revise its land-use policies to reduce the price of land,
streamline its complicated distribution system to allow easier
access by foreign firms, and boost public works spending.
   Japan, in turn, has urged the United States to reduce its
federal budget deficit, increase its savings and investment rates,
and improve worker training and education to help boost U.S. export
competitiveness.
   The newspaper said 85.9 percent of respondents said Japan should
do its best to meet the U.S. requests, for reasons such as ``to do
so will benefit Japan'' or ``because the U.S.-Japan relationship is
important.''
   Younger respondents tended to be more supportive of the U.S.
trade pressure, the newspaper said. Of respondents in their 20s,
91.9 percent said Japan should respond positively to the U.S.
requests.
   It said 76.9 percent replied that the two countries'
relationship would probably either improve or retain its current
closeness in the future.
   The newspaper did not provide a margin of error for the poll,
which it said was conducted March 16-19.

   Greyhound Lines today offered a $100,000
reward for information leading to convictions for shooting at a
Greyhound bus or terminal in the drivers' strike now in its fourth
week.
   ``The terrorism must stop,'' P. Anthony Lannie, executive vice
president and chief negotiator for Greyhound, told a news
conference. ``We hope the reward will bring an end to the violence
and help lead to arrest and convictions.''
   Union officials said Greyhound was focusing on the violence
issue ``as a basic tactic to avoid going back to the bargaining
table.''
   As Lannie announced the rewards, about a half-dozen union
members, including union president Edward M. Strait, picketed
outside the building. ``They're using that as a smokescreen to
avoid coming back to the bargaining table,'' Strait said. ``We told
them we don't condone violence. Never have.''
   Strait said violence was occuring against striking drivers as
well and said there were at least 60 incidents where pickets have
been injured.
   Strait said he was willing to return to the bargaining table at
any time. Lannie said the company would not resume talks, which
broke down last Sunday in Tucson, Ariz., until management had ``a
hard assurance'' from the union that the violence would stop.
   Lannie said there were 2,100 drivers, including 400 union
members, driving Greyhound's routes. Lannie said Greyhound was
providing 50 percent of its normal service.
   Greyhound said it was establishing a toll-free 800 number that
will be in operation from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays starting at
noon today.
   A retired law enforcement officer, usually a former FBI agent,
will take information and contact the appropriate law enforcement
agency, Greyhound officials said.
   Someone fired on a bus terminal in Texas and a bus was struck by
gunfire in Florida Monday in the latest violent episodes. No one
was injured in either of the shootings.
   Meanwhile, a California judge ordered striking drivers in the
Southwest not to threaten replacement drivers for the country's
only nationwide bus company.
   A Greyhound bus was hit by gunfire late Monday on Interstate 4
about 30 miles west of Orlando, Fla., spokeswoman Jeanne Fry said
from Greyhound's Dallas headquarters Monday night.
   The bullet destroyed the vehicle's right-hand mirror but none of
the 32 passengers was injured, she said.
   A shot was fired earlier from a passing car at the terminal in
Amarillo, Texas, Ms. Fry said.
   Workers and passengers initially thought the sound was a car
backfiring, Ms. Fry said. But small holes were found in a window,
and police found a 20-gauge shotgun cartridge in the street,
authorities said.
   The incidents brought to 28 the number of shootings, including
24 on buses, since the strike began March 2, according to Ms. Fry.
   Superior Court Judge David Yaffe in Los Angeles issued an
injunction against intimidating workers with ``fear of bodily harm
or death.''
   Greyhound alleged that strikers had blocked or damaged buses and
harassed replacement workers.
   No attorneys appeared at the hearing for the union's southwest
region.
   Nearly 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other Greyhound workers went on
strike after negotiators for Greyhound Lines Inc. and the
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions failed to reach
agreement on wage issues.
   The company said drivers earned an average $24,743 last year.
The drivers took a 22 percent pay cut three years ago before a
leveraged buyout of the company. Greyhound is offering a first-year
raise of 6.9 percent.
   No further negotiations are scheduled, Greyhound officials said
Monday.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
corn futures slightly higher, wheat slightly lower and soybeans
fractionally mixed.
   The modest strength in the corn market reflected slow farmer
selling of corn. Gains were limited, though, by lack of
confirmation that the Soviet Union recently bought U.S. corn.
   Soybeans opened lower, then turned mixed on buying linked to the
continuing slow movement of soybeans and soybean products out of
Brazil and to relatively slack export demand for U.S. soy products,
analysts said.
   Corn and soybean futures also were pressured by a National
Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook issued late Monday predicting
mild temperatures and above-normal rainfall in the Midwest early
next week.
   Wheat futures were fractionally lower as traders awaited
significant news.
   ``Wheat's just coattailing the fits and spells of the row
crops,'' said Pat O'Connell, a grains analyst with the commodities
brokerage Refco Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures were unchanged to { cent lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.58{ a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were \
cent lower to { cent higher with May at $1.50 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent lower to { cent higher with May at $6.04 a bushel.
   Livestock futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork belly futures were moderately lower after
rising sharply on Monday.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent lower to .08 cent higher with
April at 77.35 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .10
cent lower with March at 82.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .67
cent lower to .15 cent higher with April at 52.80 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .15 cent to .50 cent lower with May at
52.80 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures settled mixed on Monday.

<TEXT>
   Stock and bond underwriting, investment banking
fees and other key measures of Wall Street's health show the
patient was still sick in the first three months of 1990.
   Preliminary figures for the January-March quarter reflect the
hard times that included the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., turmoil at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and the virtual
shutdown of the junk bond market.
   There have been just three issues of high-yield bonds this year
through last Friday, worth $375 million, IDD Information Services
said Monday. That compared with 25 issues worth $5.02 billion in
the first quarter of 1990.
   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and the
Minneapolis brokerage Dain Bosworth Inc. each brought one junk bond
offering to market.
   Conspicuously absent from the list was Drexel, which virtually
created and dominated the market for high-yield debt securities
used for capital expansion and takeovers in the 1980s. Drexel's
parent company filed for bankruptcy protection last month and the
firm is liquidating.
   The total volume of new domestic issues of stocks and bonds for
the quarter as of Friday was $68.2 billion, IDD said, down from
$72.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989.
   In underwriting, investment firms sell securities to investors
on behalf of companie seeking to raise capital. The fees generated
from such activity are a major part of Wall Street's profits.
   Securities Data Co., another Wall Street numbers-cruncher,
reported that initial public offerings of common stock totaled $2.7
billion in the period from Jan. 1 to last Tuesday, off 12.5 percent
from the full 1989 first quarter.
   The IPO market had shown some momentum in the fourth-quarter of
1989, raising $4 billion through 89 offerings. There were only 35
offerings in the quarter through last Tuesday, Securities Data said.
   ``With the leveraging binge of the 1980s behind us and equity
offerings at a standstill, investment bankers became extremely
worried about profits,'' Securities Data said.
   Underwriting fees totaled $412 million in the period compared to
$564 million in the first quarter of 1989, Securities Data said. In
1986-88, quarterly fees totaled $1 billion several times, the
company said.
   Merrill Lynch remained the leader in overall securities
underwriting for the quarter with more than $11 billion in domestic
offerings, down from more than $13 billion in the full 1989 first
quarter, IDD said. Goldman, Sachs held on to second place followed
by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which rose to third place from fifth.

   Engine and transmission component maker
J.P. Industries Inc. said today it has agreed in principle to be

materials and equipment, in a $375 million transaction.
   Turner &amp; Newall will pay $17.30 a share for J.P. Industries'
stock, or about $190 million, and assume some $185 million in J.P.
Industries' debt, said Miran Sarkissian, spokesman for Ann

   The combination would give Turner &amp; Newall access to J.P.
Industries' established U.S. distribution network and give J.P.
Industries a cash infusion needed to finance growth, said analyst
Gurudutt Baliga with McDonald &amp; Co. Securities Inc. in Cleveland,
Ohio.
   Turner &amp; Newall has about 40,000 employees and reported 1989

   Prices dropped sharply on London's Stock Exchange
Tuesday as a major sell program and some disappointing domestic
earnings reports depressed the market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 32
points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 2,266.2, just a shade above its
session minimum of 2,265.8 and well below its peak of 2,295.6.
   Mediocre performances on overseas markets inspired little
confidence in London equities, while fund managers appeared
reluctant to take on new share positions until they were convinced
that the market was headed higher, dealers said.
   The major sell program could not be readily absorbed by the
market, dealers said.
   The market also fell back in reaction to an unsustainable rise
on Monday, dealers said.
   Volume amounted to a modest 385.9 million shares, compared with
353.3 million shares Monday.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Sees SEC-CFTC Merger As Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, the futures industry's
most powerful ally in Congress, has all but conceded defeat in a
battle over who should regulate trading of at least some types of
futures contracts.
   Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee,
said ``the cards are stacked'' against the Chicago Board of Trade
and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The two dominate global futures
trading and favor continued oversight by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission rather than by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The Illinois Democrat also said Congress appears to favor a
merger of the two federal regulatory agencies over proposals to
transfer to the SEC jurisdiction over only the financial futures
markets or over stock-index futures alone.
   ``If there's any movement at all with respect to partial
consolidation, there will be total consolidation,'' Rostenkowski
said.
   ``I think the cards are stacked against the members of the
Chicago trading faction.''
   Rostenkowski commented on the situation in a meeting Monday with
the Chicago Tribune's editorial board. His remarks were reported in
Tuesday's editions.
   The CFTC currently regulates all futures trading. Leaders of the
Chicago exchanges fear the SEC, which oversees stock and bond
trading, would be a stricter regulator whose actions could raise
the cost of trading futures in the United States, driving business
overseas.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden favor giving the SEC at least some of the CFTC's regulatory
authority.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest market for
stock-index futures, is opposed to any transfer of jurisdiction,
said spokesman Andrew Yemma.
   ``The position advocted by some in Washington of shifting
jurisdiction to the SEC, we just don't consider that a negotiable
matter,'' Yemma said in a telephone interview.
   The battle over jurisdiction of the industry stems in part from
the government's investigation of illegal trading practices at the
Merc and Board of Trade. Forty-eight people, mostly traders, have
been indicted in the probe, prompting criticism that the CFTC has
been lax in policing the exchanges.
   The turf battle also is rooted in the belief among some experts
that stock-index futures trading increases volatility in the stock
market. Stock-index futures are contracts that represent baskets of
stocks.
   Rostenkowski portrayed the fight as reflecting a rivalry between
New York and Chicago over dominance of the nation's financial
markets.
   ``This shows the strength of the New York operators,'' he said,
noting that Brady, former head of a powerful Wall Street firm, ``is
part of the Eastern establishment.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., another futures industry ally, on
Monday introduced a compromise bill that would put a member of each
agency on the counterpart regulatory body.
   ``I think cross-membership is a good idea to give each agency a
better appreciation of the issues the other has to face,'' Dixon
said.
   The measure ``does not call for fundamental restructuring of our
regulatory structure,'' he said, noting such restructuring is
unnecessary.
   The debate over jurisdiction is likely to heat up Thursday, when
top regulators are expected to testify before a Senate subcommittee
headed by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
   Dodd has said he favors shifting regulation of stock-index
futures to the SEC from the CFTC.

   Ravi Batra was used to making tumultuous global
economic forecasts and having nobody listen. Then some of the
predictions started to come true.
   Batra is republishing his 1977 book ``The Downfall of Capitalism
and Communism,'' this month, 13 years after the India-born
economist predicted the Iron Curtain and Berlin Wall would come
down.
   ``When I took the book around to American publishers in 1977,
they fought back laughter and said they weren't interested in such
an outrageous forecast,'' Batra said.
   ``Dr. Doom'' still is scorned by most mainstream economists, but
he no longer lacks an audience.
   Batra, a 46-year-old professor of economics at Southern
Methodist University, attracted international attention when his
1987 New York Times best-seller ``The Great Depression of 1990''
predicted a cataclysmic drop in the stock market for that year.
That Oct. 19, the Dow Jones average fell 506 points.
   The crash helped bring Batra's alarming forecasts into focus. He
expounded his theories on television talk shows and was invited to
advise a U.S. Senate committee on economic growth.
   Batra's 1987 prophecy and a follow-up called ``Surviving the
Great Depression of 1990'' paint worldwide unemployment, deflation,
stock market crashes and bank failures beginning this year and
lasting at least seven years.
   ``I predicted then and I am sticking to my guns that capitalism
and communism will both endure a complete collapse around the year
2000,'' he said in a recent interview.
   ``Except for an introduction and one additional chapter
outlining what I think will happen in the 1990s, `The Downfall of
Capitalism and Communism' is exactly as I wrote it in 1977,'' he
said.
   Britain's Macmillan Press printed 5,000 copies of the book in
1978. Now Batra's publishing it again via Dallas-based Taylor
Publishing Co.
   ``Every depression starts with a recession,'' Batra said. ``We
are already seeing signs of a recession with the recent collapses
of Campeau and Drexel Burnham.''
   Problems in the market for high-risk junk bonds pushed the U.S.
retailing operations of Campeau Corp. and investment banking
business of Drexel Burnham Lambert into bankruptcy court earlier
this year.
   ``The junk bond market is in shambles and the savings and loan
failures are magnifying. Unemployment is also beginning to rise and
will probably reach 8 percent by the end of 1990,'' Batra said.
   By 1995, he said, the country will be plagued with ``soup and
kitchen lines worse than in the 1930s.''
   Batra wrote in 1977 that communism's bare-bones living standards
combined with the continued repression of basic freedoms ``will
force Marxism to crumble under its own weight ... perhaps in the
next 25 years.''
   He's revised that scenario since communist governments began
unraveling in the East bloc last year, a result of the
liberalizations created by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. But
Batra suggested communism as a system is likely to make a last
stand before succumbing.
   ``Soviet hard-liners and army officers, who have lost out in the
recent realignment of power, could take advantage of growing unrest
and economic stagnation and overthrow Gorbachev in a military
coup,'' the book states.
   ``Even when communism recovers to make a last stand, it will
prove to be a rearguard action, delaying not stopping the
inevitable.''
   Batra said he hired a bodyguard after Black Monday in 1987 to
protect himself from death threats. He has drawn worldwide
criticism for columns published in prominent newspapers heralding
economic nightmares.
   Batra said his forecasts are born from the teachings of Indian
mentor P.R. Sarkar, a spiritualist whose writings outline a history
of social cycles dominating history.
   Sarkar heads an Indian sect called the Path of Bliss, some of
whose followers have been known to take part in rites such as
dancing with human skulls.

<HEAD>Convenience-Store Company Losing Ground</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Given current business conditions, Circle K Corp.
may not be able to complete its restructuring without the
protection of federal bankruptcy laws, the convenience-store chain
says.
   In an announcement late Monday, the company said it lost more
than $40 million from operations during the three months ended Jan.
31.
   ``If the company does not achieve a financial restructuring, it
will not have adequate liquidity,'' said the company, which is
staggering under the weight of $1.3 billion in debt.
   Circle K blamed a sales slump for its precarious position and
acknowledged that its prices had been too high. The company said it
would begin cutting prices at its stores in an effort to win back
customers.
   The Phoenix-based company accumulated its debt during a period
of explosive expansion as it grew from about 1,000 stores in 1984
to 4,685 just before it announced a restructuring last year.
   It has been trying to obtain short-term debt relief while
negotiating to sell 375 stores in the Pacific Northwest or Hawaii.
   The four-page statement said Circle K continues to believe that
a negotiated restructuring is possible. However, the negotiation of
the financial restructuring involves tricky manipulation of
deadlines, it said.
   ``Some of the deadlines and demands will be difficult to meet
and will require extension or modification. If any deadline is not
met or extended or any unsatisfied demand is not satisfactorily
altered, an impasse could result which might prevent completion of
the negotiated restructuring,'' Circle K said.
   Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-store chain
with more than 7,000 units under the 7-Eleven banner, announced
Thursday that it was selling out to a Japanese company which had
joined it as a partner in a leveraged buyout.
   Circle K's statement indicated a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing _
allowing federal protection during reorganization _ was more
likely. It also said Circle K had hired Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, a unit of the Wall Street firm, to help work out its
financial problems.
   Robert Dearth Jr., hired as Circle K president in January, has
proposed a three-point business plan to improve the company's
financial position.
   The plan includes a price cutback, improved services and product
features, and an improved mix of merchandise targeted to the needs
of neighborhoods where the stores are located.

   The U.S. dollar fell against most major currencies
in European trading Tuesday but continued its advance against the
Japanese yen.
   Gold prices were moderately higher after Monday's slump when
gold dropped as much as $30 an ounce amid reports of heavy Middle
Eastern selling.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they saw no sentiment against the
dollar and its weaker tone was due to profit-taking.
   They said disenchantment with the yen was continuing and the
donward rates against the dollar also reflected fairly active
buying of European currencies against the yen.
   The British pound, which sagged after a national budget
statement a week ago was judged disappointing by business leaders,
advanced for the fourth consecutive trading session. Dealers said
sterling was underpinned by the pound's advance against both the
yen and West German mark.
   Dealers said the weaker yen and mark followed an apparent
failure of Japanese officials to gain U.S. support for their
efforts to strengthen the yen, as well as the yen's weakness
against other currencies.
   They said the mark was affected by uncertainty over a planned
monetary union of the two German states and its likely impact on
inflation.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6255 late Tuesday, more
expensive for buyers than Monday's late $1.6135.
   Other late European dollar rates compared with Monday's late
rates were: 1.7108 West German marks, down from 1.7155; 1.5173
Swiss francs, down from 1.5275; 5.7535 French francs, down from
5.7745; 1.9247 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9267; 1,261.75 Italian
lire, up from, 1,261.50; and 1.1761 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1748.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose against the yen, closing at
156.96 yen from 156.40 at Monday's close. In London late Tuesday
the dollar closed lower at 157.35.
   Gold traders said their market was active, with gold in physical
demand after the plunge on Monday. But when prices pushed above
$370, there was another bout of selling, which reduced price levels.
   Gold bullion closed in London, the major European market, at a
bid of $369.25 a troy ounce, up from $368.50. The closing bid price
in Zurich, Switzerland, was $369.65 bid, up from $363.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $370.65, down from $383.75.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $4.98 a troy
ounce, up from $4.95.

<HEAD>Big California Pension Fund Backs Simmons in Lockheed Proxy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A big institutional holder of Lockheed Corp.
stock decided Tuesday to support Texas investor Harold Simmons in
Simmons' bid to oust the board of directors of the aerospace giant.
   The decision was made by the California Public Employees'
Retirement System, a $56 billion fund that holds 500,000 Lockheed
shares, less than 1 percent of Lockheed's stock.
   The decision by Calpers, as it is known, may carry weight far
beyond that number, however. Calpers is a leader among pension
funds pushing aggressively for more input into the management of
companies whose stock they own. Among other things, it has asked
companies such as Lockheed to set up shareholders committees to
advise management.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep has not committed to do that,
although he has indicated he may be leaning toward supporting
confidential voting by stockholders, one of a number of
``shareholders rights'' proposals to be voted on at Lockheed's
annual meeting Thursday.
   Tellep and Lockheed spokesman Robert Slayman did not immediately
return a call seeking comment on the Calpers move.
   Simmons' written agreement to recommend that his slate of
directors set up such a committee accounted for Calpers' decision,
said Kayla Gillan, the retirement fund's assistant general counsel.
   ``We met with both Mr. Tellep and Mr. Simmons,'' she said. ``Mr.
Simmons provided us a written commitment that if elected he would
recommend to his slate the creation of a shareholder advisory
committee.''
   Simmons' chief lieutenant, J. Landis Martin, said in a telephone
interview that many large institutional shareholders, like Calpers,
have favorably received Simmons' message.
   ``We feel a real tidal wave coming,'' Martin said. ``We're just
getting a really favorable response from the large shareholders.''
   Simmons, through his NL Industries chemical company, began
buying Lockheed stock about 18 months ago. He now holds about 19
percent of the common shares outstanding. He spent about $530
million buying that stake, and has shown $100 million in paper
losses on his investment as Lockheed's stock price fell.
   The biggest reason for the plunging stock price was poor
earnings. Lockheed's profits fell from $624 million on sales of
$10.4 billion in 1988 to $2 million on sales of $9.9 billion last
year, chiefly because the company had to take nearly $500 million
in special charges after underestimating the costs of developing
several programs for the military, including a submarine-hunting
plane.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese government leaders struggled Tuesday to
build a consensus before next week's deadline for responding to
U.S. demands that Japan foster trade by altering its economy.
   At Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's request, the government has
created a series of proposals aimed at meeting the U.S. requests in
recent trade talks.
   The so-called Structural Impediments Initiative talks are aimed
at eliminating factors in each country's economy that hinder
reductions in their $49 billion trade imbalance.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto met party leaders in a
series of meetings Tuesday to ask for their support for the
government proposals.
   But former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, an influential
politician who is widely seen as a prime candidate to succeed
Kaifu, reportedly warned Sakamoto not to accept every U.S. request.
   ``Japan-U.S. relations are very important and are at the core of
Japan's diplomacy, but we cannot say yes to every request,'' Kyodo
News Service quoted Abe as saying. ``If we accept everything, it
(U.S. demands) will go on endlessly.''
   Japan is expected to convey its decisions to the United States
at the fourth round of the bilateral talks, set for next Monday and
Tuesday in Washington.
   The Asahi Shimbun, a leading Japanese newspaper, recently
printed a list of more than 200 ``suggestions'' made by the United
States in the talks.
   Washington wants to eliminate barriers in Japan's economic and
business structure that it contends prevent foreign companies from
entering the Japanese market.
   For example, Washington says Japan's complex distribution system
makes it difficult for foreign businesses to sell their products on
the Japanese market. It also has pressured Japan to boost its
public works spending and tighten enforcement of its Anti-Monopoly
Law to assure fair competition for foreign businesses.
   Toshio Yamaguchi, chairman of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party's panel handling issues related to the trade talks, told The
Associated Press that Kaifu must tackle those three issues
``without hesitating to accept pain.''
   ``He needs to go as far as considering the possibility of
scrapping the laws related to those issues,'' he said. ``Or we may
not be able to come up with decisions acceptable to the United
States.''
   But other Liberal Democratic leaders were less conciliatory,
said lawmaker Takujiro Hamada, who chaired the meeting.
   ``The parliamentarians said that resistance to the reforms was
very strong in their constituencies and that it would take a long
time to carry out the reforms suggested by the United States in the
trade talks,'' Hamada said.
   Separately, the leading financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun
released results of a public opinion survey in which 47.4 percent
of the 6,186 respondents said they viewed the U.S. trade complaints
as basically reasonable.
   Some 9 percent said they completely agree with the demands and
38.4 percent replied that the U.S. claims basically were right but
there were a few unreasonable points, the newspaper said.
   It said 32.9 percent said many of the U.S. requests were
unreasonable and 6.6 called them completely unreasonable.
   The newspaper said 85.9 percent of the respondents said Japan
should do its best to meet the U.S. requests ``because to do so
will benefit Japan'' or ``because the U.S.-Japan relationship is
important.'' No margin of error was provided for the survey,
conducted March 16-19.
   Meanwhile, government officials said Tuesday they had agreed to
start considering a U.S. toy company's bid to open a discount store
in Japan.
   Toys R Us has announced plans to open a 53,800 square-foot
discount store in Niigata, 160 miles northwest of Tokyo, despite
strong opposition by local shopkeepers.
   Japan's Large-Scale Retail Stores Law _ one item targeted by
U.S. trade officials _ requires that small retailers be consulted
before any large stores are opened in their areas.
   While some Japanese retailers have had to wait up to 10 years
for permission to set up large new stores, ``consideration is under
way to shorten the maximum waiting period required under the law to
two years,'' said an official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to making entry to Japan's market difficult for
foreign retailers, the law works against larger Japanese stores
that would be more likely to carry foreign products, U.S. officials
say.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T on Tuesday announced an office computer
system the company says offers unique features to allow employees
to work together on group projects more effectively.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s new Rhapsody system links
personal computers in a network, an increasingly popular computer
configuration for offices because it allows workers to share
information.
   But AT&amp;T said its system goes beyond existing networked systems
because it can be programmed to gather information from computer
files, ask other computers for data, send tasks to employees,
schedule meetings, distribute reports for review and continuously
track the status of projects.
   Among other enhancements is the ability to automatically perform
routine functions, such as creating expense vouchers or processing
insurance claims.
   Esther Dyson, who edits the computer industry newsletter Release
1.0, said the Rhapsody system is significant because it pulls
together all the elements of a networked system: the computers
themselves, the server, the networking gear, the software to run
it, and applications software, such as word-processing programs.
   Such a package is not available from computer giants such as
International Business Machines Corp. or Digital Equipment Corp.,
although they provide most of the pieces, she said.
   Ms. Dyson said AT&amp;T's expertise in communications gives it
unique credibility in linking computers locally or worldwide.
   The AT&amp;T system, like many others, has an on-screen graphics
display that uses pictures such as file cabinets, notepads and fax
machines to execute commands, rather than typed-in written commands.
   Although AT&amp;T is selling both the computers and the software to
operate the system, it also will sell the software alone to
companies that already have desktop computers.
   The system is based on the ``client-server'' model of computing,
in which a server _ essentially a high-powered computer _ acts as
the central data repository for personal computers linked on the
network, which are called the clients.
   The Rhapsody system is based on a number of software systems
developed by other companies, including Hewlett-Packard Co.'s
NewWave software and the Windows graphical-user-interface software
made by Microsoft Corp.
   The system also will run such popular applications software as
Lotus Development Corp.'s 1-2-3 spreadsheet program and Microsoft's
Word for Windows word-processing program.
   The first Rhapsody system will be based on desktop computers
made by International Business Machines Corp. or compatible models
sold by AT&amp;T and others that use the MS-DOS operating system. Later
versions will be compatible with computers based on AT&amp;T's Unix
operating system.
   The computer server sold with the system is made by both AT&amp;T
and Intel Corp.
   AT&amp;T said Rhapsody is targeted at medium to large companies. A
complete system for a 20-person office, including the desktop
computers, will cost about $170,000. The software alone, for
companies that already have desktop computers and a server, will
cost about $2,000, AT&amp;T said.

   The stock market bounced higher in mid-afternoon
trading, after drifting without direction through much of the
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 10.36 points to
2,718.02 at 3 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was up 0.22 point
an hour earlier.
   Advancing issues outpaced decliners by a margin of about 11 to 9
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 763 issues up, 621 down and
543 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 105.70 million shares.
   Analysts said the market seemed to be gaining some momentum
after sinking to the days lows just after noon. The Dow Jones
average dipped below the 2,700-mark to 2,699 at around 12:30 EST.
   ``The market is starting to show a glimmer of life,'' said Ralph
J. Acampora, head technical analyst for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Nevertheless, volume remained slim with many institutional
players on the sidelines weighing concerns about first-quarter
corporate profits, interest rates and global uncertainties,
analysts said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<HEAD>Housing Affordability: A Top Issue For The '90s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Association of Realtors President
Norman D. Flynn says housing affordability tops the trade group's
list of key issues for the 1990s, but for now ``a buyer's
paradise'' exists in some regions of the country.
   Flynn said the association is pushing for the government to take
a more active role in helping prospective buyers, particularly
qualifying first-timers, by making it easier for them save for a
downpayment and providing more affordable loans.
   ``Many first-time buyers can't reach the first rung, and that's
hurting everyone on the higher rungs, too,'' Flynn said in an
interview Tuesday.
   He suggested that the federal government allow certain
homebuyers, and even their relatives, to tap into their Individual
Retirement Accounts and 401k savings plans without penalty of
withdrawal. He also suggested the government lower downpayment
requirements on financing insured by the Federal Housing
Administration and establish secondary markets for seller
financing, which could lower the cost of such borrowing.
   States could provide more low-interest loan programs through
mortgage revenue bonds or mortgage credit certificates, Flynn added.
   Even changes at the local government level could help, he said.
   ``Many communities have no-growth or slow-growth housing
policies,'' which have been responsible for artificially driving up
many home prices by severly limiting the housing stock, Flynn said.
He said that has had a particularly adverse impact on so-called
move-up buyers.
   Flynn said he believes fellow real estate agents should lobby
for reasonable growth initiatives within towns and cities, as well
as speedier bureaucratic processes to help hold down developers'
costs.
   For those who can afford it, however, there are attractive
bargains in certain housing markets these days, according to Flynn.
He pointed to the Northeast, where a previous sharp runup in
housing prices has subsided.
   ``The buyer needs to be reminded that this is a buyer's
paradise,'' he said. ``There's tremendous opportunity. We've got to
get the buyier to look at the market.''
   Flynn predicted that interest rates would drop by at least half
a percentage point in the next several weeks, reflecting the
continued sluggishness in the economy, and that should spur buyer
interest.
   Mortgage rates are now averaging 10.3 percent on conventional
30-year loans, after falling below 10 percent earlier in the year.
   The rise in rates had curbed housing demand, causing nationwide
sales of existing homes to drop an average 2.3 percent in February,
to the lowest level in seven months, according to an associaton
report released Monday.
   Flynn said there should be sufficient capital to meet borrowing
demands despite projections by some banks and federal regulators
that problem real estate loans are likely to increase.

<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engine and transmission component maker
J.P. Industries Inc. agreed in principle to be sold to Turner &amp;
Newall PLC, a British maker of industrial materials and equipment,
in a $375 million transaction, J.P. Industries said Tuesday.
   Turner &amp; Newall agreed to pay $17.30 a share for J.P.
Industries' stock, or about $190 million, under a tender offer and
assume some $185 million in J.P. Industries' debt, said Miran
Sarkissian, vice president for corporate affairs and development
for Ann Arbor-based J.P. Industries.
   Sarkissian said Turner &amp; Newall's tender offer was expected to
commence next week. J.P. Industries will keep its name and all
current operations in Ann Arbor, he said.
   The combination would give Turner &amp; Newall access to J.P.
Industries' established U.S. distribution network and give J.P.
Industries a cash infusion needed to finance growth, said analyst
Gurudutt Baliga with McDonald &amp; Co. Securities Inc. in Cleveland.
   J.P. Industries issued a statement in February saying it was
holding discussions with an unidentified manufacturer. John
Psarouthakis, J.P. Industries founder, chairman and chief executive
officer, said the company needed capital.
   J.P. Industries, which employs about 4,500 people and reported
1989 sales of $408 million, supplies parts to many manufacturers,
Baliga said. To keep pace with competitors, he said, ``They've got
to be able to fund technological growth in these product niches.''
   Turner &amp; Newall has about 40,000 employees and reported 1989
sales of $2 billion, Sarkissian said.

   The Department of Trade and Industry on Tuesday
announced tougher requirements for the disclosure of stock
purchases, making it more difficult to build up secret stakes in
publicly held companies.
   Starting in June, stock buyers will have to disclose to the
companies the purchases of stakes of 3 percent or more, compared
with the previous 5 percent or more.
   At the same time, the disclosures must be made within two
business days of the purchases, rather than the previous five

   The stock market ended higher today after a late
burst of buying lifted the market out of its doldrums.
   Analysts said their was no particular economic reason for the
late-day activity, which followed a dull morning session with the
market drifting in a narrow, directionless trading range.
   The market gradually began to show some life after sinking to
the day's lows just after midday. The Dow Jones average dipped
below the 2,700-mark to 2,699 at around 12:30 EST.
   Analysts attributed the late gains mainly to normal ``window
dressing'' that accompanies the end of a quarter.
   ``Funds are going into blue chips that investors regard as their
favorites,'' said Charles Jensen, chief technical analyst for the
New York investment firm MKI Securities Corp.
   Drug stocks, airlines and oil stocks were among the day's better
performers.
   Volume, nevertheless, was slim as many institutional players
remained on the sidelines with what analysts called end-of-the
quarter blues in anticipation of possible disappointing
first-quarter corporate profits.
   Corporate profits, which have been in a recession since the
second quarter of last year, continued to decline in the fourth
quarter and helped dampen the market's enthusiasm at the start of
1990.

   United Technologies Corp. and West
Germany's Daimler-Benz AG announced preliminary agreement Tuesday
to operate their jet engine divisions as a single company for
certain ventures, a move analysts said makes sense given looming
defense cuts.
   Under the memorandum of understanding, Daimler-Benz will invest
in Pratt &amp; Whitney, United Technologies' jet engine division, and
United Technologies will invest in Daimler's Motoren-und Turbinen
Union, or MTU, Daimler's aerospace and defense division.
   ``This agreement is setting in stone the relationship that has
existed for some time between United Technologies and
Daimler-Benz,'' said David Franus, an analyst with the market
research firm Forecast International. ``This is a synergistic
agreement which will open up new markets for both of these huge
companies.''
   Franus said the companies will be able to work together on
projects by pooling their resources, allowing them to pare research
and development expenses.
   The two divisions already are partners with three other jet
engine makers in International Aero Engines, a consortium that
produces the V2500 commercial jet engine. The other partners are
Rolls-Royce PLC, Japanese Aero Engines Corp. and Fiat Aviazione.
   ``This agreement comes at a time when the aero industry is
undergoing some serious rethinking,'' Franus said. ``With defense
cuts, United Technologies will undoubtedly see sales decrease and
it needs to approach other avenues in the commercial sector.''
   During the past several years, Pratt &amp; Whitney and the Daimler
unit also have expanded cooperation in the development and
manufacturing of commercial jet engines, including the Pratt &amp;
Whitney JT8D-200, PW2000 and PW300 models.
   ``We have concluded that a formal collaboration between our
companies is an excellent strategic step to broaden and expand our
historically close relationship,'' Robert F. Daniell, United
Technologies' chairman and chief executive office, said in a
statement.
   ``It will allow both Pratt &amp; Whitney and MTU to expand their
markets and complement each other's unique strengths in technology
and manufacturing,'' he said.
   Daniell and Edzard Reuter, Daimler-Benz' chairman and chief
executive officer, said the agreement comes after more than two
years of discussion among top management of both companies. Full
details have not been settled, they said.
   Under the agreement, MTU will be Pratt &amp; Whitney's principal
partner for Europe and the preferred partner worldwide.
   Once new commercial engine programs of interest to both
companies are identified, joint teams will coordinate research,
development, manufacturing and marketing, the companies said.
   ``The joint teams will work to minimize duplication in product
development and maximize efficiency by concentrating production of
certain components for common products at one company or the
other,'' the companies said in a joint statement.
   ``Operations in these programs ... will be conducted as if we
were one organization,'' the companies said, although Pratt &amp;
Whitney and MTU will retain their own management.
   United Technologies had sales of $19.5 billion last year and
employs 201,000 workers. Its products include Carrier heating and
air conditioning systems, Otis elevators and escalators, Sikorsky
helicopters, Hamilton Standard aerospace systems, Norden defense
systems and UT Automotive components and systems.
   Daimler-Benz is divided into four corporate units:
Mercedes-Benz, the automaker; AEG, an electrical equipment maker;
Deutsche Aerospace, which makes aerospace and defense equipment and
includes MTU; and Daimler-Benz InterServices, which operates in
services and finance.
   Daimler-Benz reported 1989 sales of $45 billion and has 328,000
employees.

   The stock market staged a surprising
late-afternoon rally sparked by computer-assisted futures trading
and ended higher Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 29.28 points to
finish at 2,736.94, after slipping below the 2,700-mark just after
midday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of about 3 to
2 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 889 issues up, 569 down and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 131.61 million
shares, up sharply from 116.11 million in the previous session when
the exchange recorded its second-slowest day of the year. The
slowest day was March 12, when Big Board volume was 114.8 million
shares.
   The market opened lower then drifted in a fairly narrow range
through much of the morning session. Analysts said lack of
institutional buying kept the market from gaining any momentum.
   Global uncertainties, including Japan's volatile stock market
and high interest rates, as well as nervousness about the
possibility of disappointing first-quarter corporate profits were
among the factors affecting the market in early dealings, analysts
said. Corporate profits have been in a recession since the second
quarter of last year.
   The first of a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, also renewed
concerns about the direction of U.S. interest rates.
   ``There is strong belief that the Fed won't be doing anything to
ease interest rates here,'' said Richard Ciardullo, head equities
trader for Raymond, James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   The market showed a glimmer of life after hitting the day's lows
around midday and gradually began a steady advance. Wall Street
analysts said computer-assisted program trading started a wave of
buying that soon attracted ``real buyers'' anxious to put spare
cash to work at the end of the quarter.
   ``It was a surprise to most market watchers _ a little program
activity and investment activity and trading optimism and we had a
nice rally,'' said Michael Metz, technical analyst for Oppenheimer
&amp; Co.
   Drug, airline and oil stocks benefited from the initial advance,
which spread to the broader market by the end of the session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 154.02 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market advanced $28.294 billion, or
0.87 percent, in value from Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed 1.80 to 187.40.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, American Express fell
\ to 26| after sweetening its stock-swap offer for the shares of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings it doesn't already own.
   Circle K, which said it was not in compliance with certain
financial covenants and was holding debt-restructuring talks with
lenders, declined &rsqb; to 1}.
   JP Industries gained ~ to 16~, IBM added &rsqb; to 104{, Philip
Morris rose &lsqb; to 39{ and General Electric advanced ~ to 64~.
   Two new issues also were among the most active: Alliance New
Europe Fund, among an expanding roster of closed-end mutual funds
investing overseas, closed at its initial asking price of $12; and
Geneva Steel finished unchanged at $10.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index climbed 4.54 to 396.48, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 3.87 to 341.50.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market edged

<HEAD>Big California Pension Fund Backs Simmons in Lockheed Proxy War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investor Harold Simmons won a powerful ally
Tuesday in his contest to unseat the board of Lockheed Corp.:
California's $5.6 billion Public Employees' Retirement System,
which owns 500,000 Lockheed shares.
   The pension fund, known as Calpers, said it would back Simmons
ratherthan Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep after Simmons agreed to
urge his slate of directors to set up a shareholders committee to
advise the board. Calpers advocates such panels as a way to exert
more control over companies in which it invests.
   ``We met with both Mr. Tellep and Mr. Simmons,'' said Kayla
Gillan, Calpers' assistant general counsel. ``Mr. Simmons provided
us a written commitment that if elected he would recommend to his
slate the creation of a shareholder advisory committee.''
   In waging a proxy election campaign to get his slate elected to
the Lockheed board, Simmons has tried to put Tellep on the
defensive with proposals to give Lockheed shareholders more input.
He says that if his faction is put in charge, he could manage the
company so as to increase the price of Lockheed's stock, which has
plunged nearly $20 per share in recent months.
   Lockheed closed up $1.12{ at $37 a share Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Tellep, who contends Simmons has no idea how to run a big
defense company, countered on Tuesday with his own attempt to woo
the big institutional shareholders who hold 60 percent of
Lockheed's stock.
   He promised them a seat on the board after Lockheed's annual
meeting Thursday, when the company will announce whether Tellep and
the other directors have been ousted in Simmons' proxy battle.
   ``We will work with our institutional shareholders to develop a
list of potential directors from within or outside their ranks who
could provide additional perspective to our directors,'' Tellep
said in a statement.
   ``We believe that selection of at least one director from that
list could provide important input to the future of the company.''
   Calpers holds less than 1 percent of Lockheed's stock, although
its influence is greater than the stake might suggest.
   For example, Calpers has persuaded Occidental Petroleum Corp. to
allow Calpers officials access to Occidental directors twice a
year. Occidental agreed to the meetings as a compromise after
Calpers demanded a shareholders advisory committee similar to the
one promised by Simmons.
   Simmons' chief lieutenant, J. Landis Martin, said in a telephone
interview that Calpers is one of many institutional shareholders
leaning toward Simmons.
   ``We feel a real tidal wave coming,'' Martin said. ``We're
feeling very good about our position and I'm virtually sure there
will be a clean sweep on the shareholders rights issues.''
   Those issues, to be voted on Thursday, include confidential
shareholder voting, opting out of the tough anti-takeover laws in
Delaware where Lockheed is incorporated and eliminating a ``poison
pill'' provision that makes it prohibitively expensive for anyone
to buy more than 20 percent of Lockheed's stock without the
company's approval.
   Simmons, through his NL Industries chemical company, began
buying Lockheed stock about 18 months ago. He now holds about 19
percent of the common shares outstanding. He spent about $530
million buying that stake, and has shown $100 million in paper
losses on his investment as Lockheed's stock price fell.
   A big reason for the plunging stock price was poor earnings.
Lockheed's profits fell from $624 million on sales of $10.4 billion
in 1988 to $2 million on sales of $9.9 billion last year, chiefly
because the company took nearly $500 million in charges after
underestimating the costs of developing new programs, including a
submarine-hunting plane.
   Simmons says the company has overdiversified and probably should
sell large chunks of its operations that lie outside its core
space, missiles and aeronautical businesses.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of consumers 30 days or more behind
on their payments on bank loans fell in the final three months of
1989 after rising sharply to a 10-year high in the previous
quarter, a trade group said Tuesday.
   The American Bankers Association said 2.64 percent of closed-end
installment loans were delinquent as of Dec. 31, compared with 2.88
percent on Sept. 30 and 2.49 percent a year earlier.
   ``Consumers look pretty good for now,'' said ABA chief economist
Robert H. Dugger.
   The delinquency rate is based on a nationwide survey of 800
banks. It includes seven different types of closed-end consumer
loans: personal, two types of auto loans, mobile home, recreational
vehicle, property improvement and home equity.
   The delinquency rate for open-ended home equity lines, which are
tracked separately, dropped to 0.78 percent in the fourth quarter,
down from 0.93 percent in the third quarter.

<HEAD>Law Firm In Lincoln Thrift Suit Announces Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The law firm of Gov. George Deukmejian's top
fund-raiser will pay up to $14.3 million to settle class-action
lawsuits filed by investors who bought now-worthless junk bonds
from Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association.
   The fund-raiser, Karl Samuelian, said Monday that his firm,
Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian, agreed to pay at least
$4.3 million. If plaintiffs do not recover an additional $10
million from other defendants, the firm will make up the
difference, Samuelian said in a statement.
   The law firm's insurance will cover the $14.3 million in
guarantees. That amount is the equivalent of 7{ cents on the dollar
for the investors who lost money on the bonds.
   In return, Samuelian's firm will be dropped as a defendant in
the suits.
   Seventeen lawsuits naming more than 20 defendants have been
filed in federal and state courts by attorneys representing
bondholders who lost money to Phoenix, Ariz.-based American
Continental Corp., Lincoln's parent company.
   Parker, Milliken was one of several legal and accounting firms
hired by American Continental to persuade regulators to permit the
sale of American Continental high-yield, or junk, bonds at Lincoln
branches.
   Lawyers from the firm, including Samuelian, argued the case
before regulators, who eventually permitted the sales. The lawsuits
accuse Parker, Milliken of wrongly using its political influence
with the regulators, several of whom had worked for the firm in the
past.
   More than 23,000 investors, many of them elderly people on fixed
incomes, lost $200 million on junk bonds they bought at Lincoln
branches. Many have said they were tricked into buying the bonds
under the pretense they were insured like regular savings accounts.
   A civil suit filed by the state earlier this month accuses
American Continental owner Charles H. Keating of casting a web of
fraud and lies to snare investors into buying the bonds.
   Keating has denied any wrongdoing and suggests he is the victim
of a campaign of harassment by government officials who are unable
to comprehend his sophisticated financial tactics.
   Samuelian was the private attorney for Keating, whose
corporation has filed for bankruptcy protection.
   Though Samuelian has never held a government post, he has been
the chief fund-raiser for Deukmejian, treasurer of his campaigns
and a noted political confidante of the Republican governor.
   The tentative settlement is subject to court approval.
   ``We have reached an agreement in principle and the details will
be worked out in a final settlement agreement,'' said Seth Aronson,
an attorney representing the Los Angeles-based firm.
   Samuelian declined to elaborate on reasons for reaching the
settlement.

<HEAD>Former Allied Executive's Funds Earmarked for Creditors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $5 million payment by Allied Stores Corp.
into a tax-exempt trust fund for a former Allied executive is part
of the corporation's bankruptcy estate for distribution to
creditors, a judge ruled Tuesday.
   The ruling was made by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.,
who is overseeing the Chapter 11 reorganization of Allied and its
sister retailer, Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Aug upheld Allied's argument that the trust agreement mandates
that in the event of a bankruptcy filing, the fund would become
part of Allied's bankruptcy estate for payment to creditors under
court supervision.
   Aug rejected arguments by a lawyer for the executive, Thomas M.
Macioce, that Macioce was entitled to the $5 million as part of the
retirement terms he obtained when he resigned as Allied's hairman
and chief executive officer in January 1987 after 27 years with the
company.
   Macioce, now a partner in the New York City law firm Shea &amp;
Gould, didn't attend the Cincinnati hearing and could not be
reached at his office for a response.
   Macioce was the only one of nine current or former Federated and
Allied executives with such trusts who objected to their inclusion
among funds for payment to creditors, said Allied lawyer Greg
Gordon.
   Aug also gave Allied and Federated permission to complete $91
million worth of ongoing store construction projects in Florida,
Oregon, Tennessee and Washington state.
   The projects include construction of two new stores _ a $30
million Bloomingdale's in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and an $11.3
million Bon Marche in Eugene, Ore. The other projects are a $21.5
million renovation of the Bon Marche flagship store in downtown
Seattle, an $11.5 million reworking of a Bon Marche store in
Tukwila, Wash., and a $16.6 million renovation of Goldsmith's
flagship store in Memphis, Tenn.
   Federated and Allied must obtain Aug's permission for all
corporate spending since their Jan. 15 Chapter 11 filings.
Federated and Allied are units of Toronto-based Campeau Corp.
   Aug also allowed lawyers for Federated and Allied and their
suppliers to work out terms that would allow the two retailers to
return $25 million worth of Christmas season merchandise for credit.
   Returns of such merchandise are routine in retailing, but were
complicated when some suppliers refused the returns because of
questions about the effect of the Chapter 11 filings, company
spokeswoman Catharine Wright said.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens Again, Gold Rebounds a Bit</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf, `The dollar ...,' to CORRECT Monday's yen
figure in New York to 156.70, sted 157.70.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished higher against most key
currencies except the British pound Tuesday, extending a rally that
reflected fears of growing political and economic instability
abroad.
   Gold prices rebounded slightly after a tumultuous plunge Monday
that strategists traced to the dollar's strength and abnormally
large gold sales from the Middle East. By 4 p.m. EST, bullion
fetched $368.85 a troy ounce at Republic National Bank in New York,
up $2.10 from the previous session.
   Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rise largely to
questions over Japan's ability to manage its unwieldy financial
markets and other economic problems. They also said the Soviet
Union's resolve to suppress Lithuanian independence was unsettling
European markets and raising demand for dollars.
   ``I'm basically a dollar bull, just based on a fundamental
assessment of the world situation,'' said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief
trader at the Banco di Sicilia's New York branch. ``As a safe
haven, I don't think anybody can beat the United States right now.''
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at the New York branch of Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank, also said he foresaw continued appetite for
dollars. ``With the situation in Lithuania, I think the dollar has
little downside potential.''
   Some said unfounded rumors that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev might resign contributed to the dollar's strength. Such
rumors frequently have surfaced in the climate of uncertainty
surrounding changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``I didn't see it on any news screens, but I heard it from
brokers,'' said Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury
services at the New York office of Bank Brussels Lambert, a large
Belgian commercial bank. ``It was clearly associated with the
initial runup.''
   The dollar strengthened in Tokyo to 156.96 yen, up from 156.40
Monday. Later in London, the dollar traded at 157.35 yen. By the
time trading concluded in New York the dollar fetched 157.74 yen,
up from 156.70 yen late Monday. The dollar was at the highest level
against the yen in more than three years.
   In London, the pound strengthened for the fourth straight
session, benefiting partly from a few large orders and a temporary
market shortage of the British currency. It cost $1.6255 to buy
sterling late Tuesday, more expensive than $1.6135 late Monday. In
New York, the pound fetched $1.6260, more valuable than the $1.6185
rate late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with levels late
Monday included: 1.7128 West German marks, up from 1.7075; 1.5182
Swiss francs, down from 1.5205; 1.1765 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1760; 5.7610 French francs, up from 5.7480; 1,258.50 lira, up
from 1,256.00
   Other late European dollar rates compared with Monday's late
rates: 1.7108 marks, down from 1.7155; 1.5173 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5275; 5.7535 French francs, down from 5.7745; 1.9247 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9267; 1,261.75 lire, up from, 1,261.50; and
1.1761 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1748.
   The shaken gold market appeared to stabilize somewhat from its
severe beating Monday, when bullion prices plunged as much as $30
an ounce and nearly erased a rally that began six months ago. Some
traders said the Monday decline was the worst rout they'd seen in
years.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose $2.90 a troy ounce to $368.70.
   Earlier, gold rose 75 cents an ounce to $369.25 in London and
rose $6.25 an ounce to $369.25 in Zurich. It fell $13.10 a troy
ounce in Hong Kong to $370.65.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $4.98 a troy ounce, up
from $4.95. On the New York Comex, silver for current delivery
finished at $4.954 cents, down fractionally from $4.955.

<HEAD>New Xerox Copier Can `Phone Home' About Problems</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. on Tuesday introduced a new
copier that can ``phone home'' for help when it senses a problem
developing.
   The Xerox 5065, a mid-volume copier that produces 62 copies a
minute, is the first Xerox copier to offer a built-in ``remote
interactive communications'' system, the company said.
   Xerox's high-volume 1090 copier offers the RIC system as an
optional add-on feature, said Xerox spokesman Daniel C. Minchen.
   The RIC system continuously checks the copier's performance
against set standards and alerts a central computer when it notices
a potential problem, Minchen said.
   Information about the problem is transmitted via telephone to
the central computer, where an artificial intelligence system
analyzes the data and decides whether a service call is needed.
   Surveys show that customers' highest priority is avoiding copier
breakdowns and emergency maintenance calls, the company said.
   The RIC system should notice most problems before the people
using the machine do, Minchen said, eliminating the need for
customers to call Xerox for service.
   ``With every (service) call there's a possibility for
dissatisfaction,'' he said. ``This eliminates all that by notifying
the company before a potential problem becomes a real problem.
We'll call the customer first.''
   Minchen said the RIC system will not notice problems such as
loose doors or spots on the copy. But it will detect document
misfeeds, depletion of the copier's developer or toner, repeated
paper jams and other mechanical or electrical failures, he said.
   The artificial intelligence system decides what the problem
might be and sends a service worker out with the right parts,
Minchen said.
   The system also keeps track of how many copies are made, which
Minchen said will be a more efficent way of billing than requiring
customers to keep track of how much they use a machine.
   The 5065 copier will sell for $30,650, Xerox said.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The trustee for the bankrupt Delaware &amp;
Hudson Railway was given less than two weeks to find a buyer for
the freight carrier or face the liquidation of the nation's oldest
continually operated railroad.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen Balick on Tuesday granted a request
from trustee Francis Dicello for an extension to continue operating
D&amp;H while a buyer is sought. The judge set an April 11 date to
determine whether the rail line will be sold or if liquidation
should begin.
   Dicello said the deadline for offers is April 6.
   ``If there clearly are no potentially doable offers on the
table, then we will liquidate,'' he said.
   Shippers who use the D&amp;H lines would be notified that they must
find an alternative by midnight April 16, which has been set as the
shutdown date.
   If there is a potential buyer for all or part of the rail line,
Dicello said he would ask the court for another extension until the
sale is completed.
   D&amp;H, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June
1988, is about $100 million in debt. Dicello said liquidation could
result in an estimated $70 million to $80 million.
   ``But I don't want to do that,'' he said. ``I don't see a lot of
winners'' with liquidation.
   With the extension, the rail line will continue to operate with
subsidies from shippers, the states of New York and Pennsylvania
and with cash collateral that is being held for its secured
creditors.
   The extension was supported by attorneys representing the
shippers, the states and a majority of the creditors.
   John Broadley, attorney for Guilford Transportation Inc., D&amp;H's
sole shareholder, opposed the extension, and asked the court for
immediate liquidation.
   ``There is no interest by anyone of acquiring D&amp;H. The trustee
has no offer,'' Broadley said.
   Canadian Pacific Ltd. submitted a bid of $35 million for D&amp;H but
withdrew the offer in mid-February after talks broke down with
Consolidated Rail Corp. over track rights between Harrisburg, Pa.,
and Hagerstown, Md. The tracks would give the carrier access to key
southern routes.
   Broadley said there was no assurance that Congress would pass
legislation forcing Conrail to negotiate track rights with Canadian
Pacific.
   Dicello said Canadian Pacific indicated Monday that it would
submit a significantly lower bid for D&amp;H without the track rights.
Dicello indicated in court he would not consider an extremely low.
   D&amp;H carries freight from Montreal to Washington, D.C., and from
Albany to Buffalo in New York. More than 400 workers would lose
their jobs if no buyer is found.

   Sony Corp. of America has formed a new
division to coordinate its engineering and manufacturing activities
in the U.S., the company said.
   Sony Engineering and Manufacturing of America (SEMA) will
oversee plants producing consumer and industrial display products,
audio and video products and audio speakers, Masaaki Morita,
chairman and chief executive of Sony Corp. of America, said Tuesday.
   The new division also will contribute to Sony's planning
activities and work with global business groups to develop and
implement long-range manufacturing plans. It will be based in Park
Ridge, a suburban area just outside New York City.
   Morita will serve as chairman of SEMA. The president and chief
operating officer is Junitake Ando.
   Morita is a deputy president of Sony Corp. and younger brother
of the parent company's chairman, Akio Morita.
   Sony has invested nearly $1 billion in U.S. operations since
establishing its first manufacturing facility in San Diego in 1972,
Morita said in a news release.
   ``As we plan to invest a similar amount over the next three to
five years, it is important that we develop local mechanisms for
directing and integrating the various manufacturing and engineering
operations as they grow,'' Morita said.
   ``We also believe that SEMA will serve to strengthen our
long-term commitment to contributing and being a part of the local
U.S. communities where we operate,'' he said.
   Ando holds degrees from Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pa.,
and the University of Tokyo. He has been responsible for planning
Sony's overseas manufacturing plants and has served as manager of
corporate planning for Sony Corp. of America.

<HEAD>UAL's Wolf Was Paid $1.15 Million Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. revealed that last year's failed $6.8
billion buyout bid by management and employees of its United
Airlines subsidiary cost the company $76 million in expenses.
   UAL also revealed that Chairman Stephen Wolf, who led the buyout
attempt, was paid $1.15 million last year, double his 1988
compensation.
   The company also disclosed that John C. Pope, UAL's chief
financial officer, took advantage of last year's steep climb in
UAL's stock price to exercise about $5.9 million in stock options
or stock appreciation rights.
   The information was contained in proxy materials mailed Monday
to UAL shareholders for the company's annual meeting, scheduled for
April 26 in the Chicago suburb of Rosemont.
   Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder with an 11.8
percent stake, is threatening a proxy fight to replace the
15-member board with its own slate. If successful, Coniston plans
to sell the company to UAL employees in a deal valued by analysts
at about $185 a share, or more than $4 billion.
   If the company is sold to its employees at that price, Wolf
would stand to make a $13.9 million profit on his stock and stock
options.
   Coniston Partners principal Keith Gollust said he expects
Coniston's proxy materials to receive Securities and Exchange
Commission approval and be mailed to shareholders by early next
week.
   UAL's board agreed last week to negotiate with its three
employee unions in hopes of reaching agreement on a higher buyout
price and avoiding a proxy fight.
   The board was scheduled to meet Wednesday, said company
spokesman Robert Doughty. The company's stock rose $3.50 to $161.50
on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
   The proposal made earlier this month by United's pilots,
machinists and flight attendants unions included provisions for UAL
to reimburse the unions for up to $65 million if their bid is
successful or topped by a higher offer, or up to $25 million if the
bid fails.
   According to the company's proxy, Wolf received $575,000 in
salary last year and another $575,000 in bonuses. In 1988, he
received $575,000 in salary and no bonuses.
   Pope and Wolf were criticized last year by the unions for the
$114 million they stood to receive for their stock holdings had the
$300-a-share buyout bid succeeded. The offer failed for lack of
financing in October.
   UAL incurred a large part of the failed buyout's costs,
including $59 million in fees to the buyout group's bankers and
lawyers.

<HEAD>Italian Tycoon Questioned In Connection With Ambrosiano Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PIERO VALSECCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Carlo De Benedetti was questioned
for six hours by a judge about his 65 days as a vice president of
Banco Ambrosiano, the bank that touched off Italy's largest banking
scandal when it failed in 1982.
   At the end of Tuesday's questioning, De Benedetti told reporters
he was ``serene and satisfied'' because he was able to tell the
magistrate ``the total honesty of my behavior.''
   De Benedetti, the head of a financial empire that includes the
Olivetti computer group, was questioned by Raffaele Invrea, chief
judge of the Milan Court of Appeals, after being notified that he
was suspected of possible involvement in fraudulent bankruptcy.
   Invrea declined to give any details of the questioning and said
only that ``a judge speaks by taking measures.''
   No action was taken against De Benedetti, who had been
investigated by a lower court in the same case.
   Lower court judges Antonio Pizzi and Renato Brichetti, after a
long investigation into the Banco Ambrosiano failure, decided last
April not to pursue the case in regard to De Benedetti, whose
summoning for questioning this week came as a surprise.
   The scope of the lower court investigation centered on whether
De Benedetti made an illegal profit from his investment in the bank
_ about 52 billion lire ($40 million) on a 2 percent stake in
Ambrosiano.
   De Benedetti has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing or that he
profited from his investment.
   The financier's vice presidency in Italy's largest private bank,
in which the Vatican bank was a major shareholder, lasted 65 days
through Jan. 22, 1982.
   De Benedetti sold the stake once he resigned his post. He cited
disagreements with bank chairman Roberto Calvi for his decision to
quit.
   Calvi, nicknamed ``God's banker'' because of his close ties with
the Vatican, was found hanging from a London bridge in June 1982.
   Ambrosiano collapsed two months later following the failure to
win repayment of $1.3 billion in loans made by the Italian bank to
dummy Latin American companies backed by the Institute for
Religious Works, which is commonly called the Vatican bank.
   De Benedetti said the questioning was long but added that it was
difficult to detail his 65 days in a few hours.
   A trial of 25 Banco Ambrosiano board members and officials,
charged following the bank collapse, is scheduled to begin in Milan
on May 29.
   Court sources indicated that appeal judges would decide De
Benedetti's position by that date.

<HEAD>Nordstrom Cuts Seattle Newspaper Ads, Denies Link to Labor
Coverage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Nordstrom Inc. executive called a Seattle
newspaper's coverage of the retailer's labor problems ``horrible,''
but he said the company's decision to cut advertising in the paper
wasn't meant as retaliation.
   Co-chairman Jim Nordstrom said the company was only taking a
closer look at the effectiveness of its advertising.
   Nordstrom spokeswoman Megan McKenzie said the company told The
Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer on Friday that it was
cutting back on its ads. The papers maintain separate editorial and
news staffs, but The Times handles advertising and printing for
both under a joint operating agreement.
   Cindy Demme, vice president for sales promotion, said Nordstrom
has been trying different mixes of advertising media in other
markets and wanted to try the same thing in Seattle.
   Ads were cut from six last Thursday in the Times, including
three full-page displays and three smaller ones, to one full-page
ad planned for this Thursday.
   Known for its upscale clothing and attentive customer service,
Nordstrom has come under increasing scrutiny for stormy labor
relations and declining profits and stock prices.
   Earlier this year, it was hit by a triple whammy: state findings
that Nordstrom failed to pay some employees for work done outside
their scheduled hours, unfair labor practice complaints by the
National Labor Relations Board and a 34 percent profit slump for
the year ending Jan. 31.
   The Wall Street Journal also ran a front-page article by
reporter Susan C. Faludi detailing complaints of past and present
Nordstrom workers.
   ``If we do cut our advertising anywhere, it's because we're not
getting a good value for our dollars,'' Jim Nordstrom was quoted as
saying in Tuesday's Times, ``and frankly, with the rising costs of
your two papers, we need to do some re-evaluating.''
   Nordstrom said there was no link between the ad cuts and
coverage in the papers but added, referring to the Times:
   ``We think your coverage is horrible, the worst in the nation,
worse than The Wall Street Journal because that girl didn't know
us. She just regurgitated what the union said.''
   Michael Fancher, Times executive editor, said advertising cuts
wouldn't alter the newspaper's coverage.
   ``I think it's important for readers to understand that when
advertisers purchase an ad, they are buying exposure to our
readers. Nothing more and nothing less,'' he said.
   Times ad director Marji Ruiz said Nordstrom is one of the
afternoon paper's top 10 advertisers.
   ``Our rate increases over the last few years have been less than
the national average,'' said Jack A. Williams, Times sales and
marketing vice president.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, the NLRB dismissed a petition seeking to
decertify United Food and Commercial Workers Local 367 as the
bargaining agent for Nordstrom clerks at the Tacoma store.
   A decertification petition also was filed Tuesday against UFCW
Local 1001 in the Seattle area, but Larry McCarger, assistant to
the NLRB's regional director, said that attempt might fare no
better.
   McCarger said the board has a long history of refusing to
conduct decertification elections while unresolved NLRB complaints
are pending.
   The two locals represent about 1,800 employees at six Nordstrom
outlets, the only unionized stores in the chain. Nordstrom has 60
stores and 30,000 employees in Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Utah,
Virginia and California.
   One organizer of the decertification campaign is Kathleen
Sargent, a clerk in the downtown Seattle store and goddaughter of
Anne Nordstrom, sister of co-chairman Bruce Nordstrom.
   ``The biggest concern that we've had is the union has distorted
the image of what it's like to work for Nordstrom,'' Sargent told
the Post-Intelligencer. ``They make it sound like it's a slave
house, and it's not. It's a very positive and productive
environment.''
   The NLRB has accused Nordstrom of attempting to bypass the union
and negotiate directly with employees, refusing to provide the
union with information for collective bargaining and changing
vacation benefits without negotiating with the union.

<HEAD>Board OKs Bankruptcy Filing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTROSE, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colorado-Ute Electric Association, unable
to control expenses and raise rates to its liking, has decided to
file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Tuesday's decision came nearly one year after Colorado-Ute,
which serves about 600,000 Colorado residents, defaulted on its
loans. The utility is $1.2 billion in debt and owes the federal
government at least $723 million.
   Board Chairman Joe deGanahl II blamed the move on the Colorado
Public Utilities Commission, which decided March 8 to grant
Colorado-Ute an 8 percent rate hike instead of the 23.7 percent
increase the utility sought.
   ``We tried very hard to resolve this in a manner to solve the
needs of all the parties,'' deGanahl told reporters after the vote.
``That was unfortunately not to be, because of the actions of
others. Clearly the straw was the commission's decision.''
   His comments were denounced by the PUC and state Office of
Consumer Counsel, who said Colorado-Ute brought its problems upon
itself.
   ``It has taken many years for Colorado-Ute to get in the
financial position it finds itself,'' said PUC spokeswoman Barbara
Fernandez. ``It is unfair to blame us for what has occurred.''
   The director of the consumer counsel office called for
appointment of an independent receiver to direct the utility's
reorganization ``given what Colorado-Ute's management has done. The
court should put the company in the hands of others.''
   The board of directors met for two days behind closed doors and
emerged Tuesday afternoon to vote 12-0 in public to authorize
company president Ray Keith to file for Chapter 11 reorganization
at his discretion.
   ``A Chapter 11 reorganization filing is imminent unless
something materially changes in the next few days,'' Keith said in
a statement.
   The board took no action on an order from the U.S. Rural
Electrification Administration directing the company to raise its
rates by 24 percent to meet loan obligations due the federal
government.
   The board directed Keith to meet with corporate lawyers and
report back next month. Directors said the company was surprised by
the REA order, which came in a letter on Monday.
   Calls to REA officials Tuesday weren't returned.
   The PUC said a U.S. District Court decision in Indiana last May
ruled that the state regulatory commission had jurisdiction on
rates, not the REA.
   ``We don't think they have the authority,'' Fernandez said.
   Colorado-Ute serves 14 rural electrical cooperatives in 49
Colorado counties. It has lost money for three straight years,
including an estimated $15 million loss in 1989.
   Meanwhile, the board of directors nearly doubled its own
spending for directors' fees and travel and awarded merit increases
to management employees.
   ``They are symptomatic of the problem,'' said Ron Binz, director
of the Office of Consumer Counsel. ``They had the opportunity to
turn it around, but all we've seen in the last year is an inability
to come to grips with the problem.''

<HEAD>D&amp;H Trustee Asks for New Bids</HEAD>

   The bankruptcy trustee for the Delaware &amp;
Hudson Railway is seeking new bids for all or part of the failing
freight line, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad, a
spokesman for the Federal Railroad Administration said.
   The trustee, Francis P. Dicello, met Monday in a closed session
with representatives of about 16 carriers with an interest in D&amp;H
and invited them to make offers, said Mark Lindsey, the FRA's
general counsel.
   The talks took place under a special rule that allows
competitors to discuss business without violating antitrust laws,
Lindsey said.
   Dicello also is planning to return to bankruptcy court in
Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday to seek a month's extension of the
order allowing him to run the D&amp;H while he seeks a buyer, Lindsey
said. That order is set to expire Tuesday.
   Dicello, who has been seeking a buyer for D&amp;H since September,
was not in his office Monday and did not return a phone call.
   David Murray, a spokesman for the New York Department of
Transportation, said Dicello would entertain bids for the whole D&amp;H
system until April 6.
   The meeting Monday was called after Consolidated Rail Corp.
broke off negotiations last week with Canadian Pacific Ltd. over
trackage rights.
   Canadian Pacific had bid $35 million for D&amp;H but withdrew the
offer in mid-February when Conrail refused to negotiate use of
tracks between Harrisburg, Pa., and Hagerstown, Md., which would
give the carrier access to key southern routes.
   ``We've been at this with them for three months now and when you
get the chairmen of the two companies agreeing that they're going
to disagree ... there's no higher authority in either company, so
that puts an end to it,'' CP Rail spokesman John Cox said Monday.
   Conrail has maintained that providing the rights would reduce
its annual revenues substantially and could lead to the loss of 600
to 900 jobs.
   D&amp;H carries freight from Montreal to Washington, D.C., and from
Albany to Buffalo in New York. The railway filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in June 1988. More than 400 workers would
lose their jobs if no buyer is found.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said Friday he would ask Senate
leaders to speed up consideration of a bill he introduced to force
Conrail to relinquish its track rights.
   ``It seems clear that Conrail never wanted to make a deal that
would help revive and strengthen the D&amp;H,'' D'Amato said in a
statement.

<HEAD>South Korea Registers Lowest GNP Growth in Eight Years</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Figures are in U.S. dollars.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   South Korea's gross national product
grew 6.7 percent last year after inflation, the slowest level of
real growth since 1982 and a reflection of the country's sluggish
exports, central bank officials said Tuesday.
   Tallies by the Bank of Korea showed the 1989 growth rate was far
down from 1988's 12.4 percent and the lowest since the GNP grew 5.9
percent in 1982.
   South Korea's economic boom took off in 1986, resulting in a
double-digit GNP growth for three years _ 12.9 percent in 1986, 13
percent in 1987 and 12.4 percent in 1988.
   But last year the nation's economy was hit by labor strikes for
higher wages and the steady appreciation of the Korean won, which
hurt exports.
   Bank officials said the per capita income stood at $4,968 in
1989, compared with $4,127 a year earlier.
   By breakdown, the manufacturing sector grew 3.7 percent in 1989,
compared to a 13.4 percent growth in 1988, while construction and
service industries grew 15.4 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.
