   An explosion shattered a two-story
bank Tuesday, killing three people and injuring 14 others,
officials said. Two people were listed in serious condition.
   Firefighters and volunteers dug by hand through the rubble of
the downtown Crested Butte National Bank to pull out survivors,
witnesses said. The entire building was leveled except for the
vault.
   The cause of the blast in this Rocky Mountain ski resort was not
immediately determined, but authorities said they were
investigating the possibility of a bomb or methane gas buildup.
   Crested Butte Police Chief Hank Smith said two restaurants
received bomb threats over the week, and one of them was evacuated.
   Mayor Wes Light said three bodies were pulled from the rubble,
and the 14 others believed inside during the explosion were pulled
out.
   ``A huge explosion occurred. I felt the floor drop beneath me,''
said bank teller Joe Sabino, who was treated at Gunnison County
Hospital for scratches and burns on his hands.
   ``Fortunately, nothing came into contact with me,'' Sabino said.
``It (the rubble) built a little cave around me. I was little bit
upside down.''
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent a
12-person response team to the scene, and Gov. Roy Romer made
National Guard units available to provide assistance if needed.
   The explosion occurred at 9:15 a.m., shortly after the bank
opened.
   About 200 people responded quickly to the scene and started
digging with their hands.
   ``They started digging through the rubble, helping the people
who were still alive,'' said Mark Reaman, a photographer for the
Chronicle &amp; Pilot newspaper.
   ``The whole town would suddenly become silent, stopping to see
if they could hear someone. It was the most eerie thing I've ever
heard. Luckily, many times they found someone who was still alive.''
   The dead were identified as bank employees Jade Woelk, Donna
Smith and Monica Henning. Their ages were not available.
   Thom Cox, the bank president, was in St. Mary's Hospital in
Grand Junction where he underwent leg surgery and was being treated
for possible broken ribs, officials said. He was reported in
serious but stable condition.
   Roxy Lypps was admitted to intensive care with second- and
third-degree burns over 30 to 40 percent of her body and was in
serious but stable condition.
   Hope Ostheimer, who works nearby, said the building ``completely
collapsed on itself.''
   ``People started running from their cars and businesses and just
started digging,'' said a passerby who identified himself only by
his first name, Brad.
   ``I started digging, but I wigged out when I saw the condition
of one of the victims,'' he said. ``One guy crawled out,'' but the
rest were trapped.
   Dusty Demerson, who was in his shop at Color West Photography
about a block from the bank, also went to investigate.
   ``The president of the bank ... was hanging out the back of the
bank by his legs and we got him down,'' he said.
   By that time, ambulances arrived and Demerson also started
digging for survivors.
   Six of the injured were taken to Gunnison County Hospital 30
miles away; the others were treated at clinics, the mayor said.
   Tom Yates, chief of the Gunnison Police Department, said three
people were in critical condition.
   Bob Gillen, communications director for the Crested Butte ski
area, said the resort put its disaster plan into effect and handled
rescue operations.
   ``We're doing this as if this was an avalanche, because what we
have here is a material avalanche,'' he said. ``They're doing it by
hand. We have some heavy equipment there, but most of the rescuers
are using their hands.''
   ``There was an explosion, but there are no natural gas lines in
there. We're puzzled by it,'' said Gillen. ``It doesn't make
sense.''
   ``I'm not ruling out a bomb, and I'm not ruling out an explosion
from methane buildup,'' Smith said. ``We've just completed the
rescue effort, and we're just now beginning the investigation.''
   Crested Butte, population about 1,000, is 9,000 feet high in the
western Colorado mountains.
   Heavy snow hampered rescue efforts and delayed the arrival of
ambulances from Gunnison, Gillen said. An airplane did manage to
land in Gunnison and stood by to take victims to St. Mary's
Hospital in Grand Junction, western Colorado's largest hospital.
   Bank officials said they plan to open up a temporary bank on
Wednesday in another building.

   Police broke up opposition party sit-ins at
eight city halls in Guerrero state on Tuesday, and at least three
police and two activists were killed, government and party
officials said.
   The center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party had paralyzed 20
of the southwestern state's 75 city governments for three months,
protesting alleged fraud in Dec. 3 elections.
   Gov. Francisco Ruiz Massieu said five people were killed in the
police actions.
   ``Now peace has been restored,'' Ruiz Massieu said in a
television interview.
   At a Mexico City news conference held by eight Guerrero state
Democratic Revolutionary Party leaders, party spokesman Ricardo
Pascoe said: ``We are confronting state terrorists that want
repression.''
   Government officials said about 200 state police and cadets were
called out to remove 350 people.
   Opposition party leaders said about 80 supporters were injured
and 30 arrested.
   Two party members were reportedly killed when police broke up
the sit-in at the Ometepec city hall about 50 miles southeast of
Acapulco, Guerrero party chief Rosalio Wences Reza said.
   Two policemen were killed with automatic weapons when they tried
to protesters at the nearby Cruz Grande town hall, Guerrero state
government spokesman Francisco Javier Rangel said by telephone.
   Federal Highway Police Commander Mario Juarez Servin reported
another officer killed in the confrontations, the government news
agency Notimex said.
   The state called on police to act ``because of what happened
Feb. 27, when party members tried to take over the Acapulco and
Zihuatanejo airports,'' the state government said in a statement.
   Three people were killed in confrontations when police stopped
protesters on airport roads last week in the resort cities of
Acapulco and Ixtapa, near Zihuatenejo.
   Rangel said the state government is concerned about the state's
image, because tourism is its main source of income and employment.
Tourism is Mexico's third-largest source of foreign exchange.
   State legislators agreed Tuesday to measures allowing
power-sharing in seven Guerrero communities where city halls are
still blockaded, a state news release said.
   Rangel said he didn't know if more police actions would be taken
to end blockades.

<HEAD>Four Charges Dropped, Buckey Lawyer Makes Unusual Move to Keep
Charge</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, `An afternoon...' to UPDATE with judge denying

   Raymond Buckey pleaded innocent Tuesday to
eight revived charges involving three girls in the McMartin
Pre-School molestation case after his attorney requested that a sex
charge slated for dismissal be retained.
   ``I am innocent, your honor, I plead not guilty,'' Buckey told
Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg. The judge formally
dismissed four unresolved charges against Buckey and held in
abeyance one contested charge.
   The case now has been reduced from hundreds of counts that once
involved 41 alleged abuse victims from the now-defunct Manhattan
Beach preschool.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis asked the judge not to dismiss one
allegation against Buckey involving the son of Judy Johnson, the
mother whose complaints triggered the investigation, saying it
would allow him to present to jurors ``the genesis of this case.''
   The defense has previously said the case was the result of
community hysteria churned by Mrs. Johnson, who also accused a Los
Angeles school board member of molesting her child. She has since
died of a liver ailment related to alcoholism.
   ``It seems a little strange that the defense would be objecting
to the dismissal of this particular count, but I'm willing to
listen,'' Weisberg said.
   At an afternoon hearing, Weisberg denied the request, as well as
a defense motion to remove the Los Angeles district attorney's
office from the case.
   Davis said statements by District Attorney Ira Reiner indicate
he has forfeited objectivity in the case. He cited a state Supreme
Court ruling that in the test of a prosecutor's office decision to
pursue charges ``it is not that it shall win a case, but that
justice shall be done.''
   Deputy District Attorney Joseph Martinez said Reiner has a right
to his opinion.
   ``What the D.A. is saying is that he believes Mr. Buckey to have
committed these offenses. What kind of a D.A. would say that he is
going to prosecute someone that he feels is innocent?'' Martinez
asked before the hearing.
   There were 13 counts unresolved by jurors in the trial, which
lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than $10 million.
Jurors in the first trial were leaning toward acquittal of the
charges involving the three youngsters in the new trial.
   ``I don't know why they're doing it,'' Buckey said outside the
courtroom before his arraignment on the renewed charges. ``They've
got three of their weakest witnesses.''
   Buckey predicted trial would take a year. ``Another year of
McMartin, mini-McMartin, chiseled down as this case goes into
overtime, falling apart until finally the second jury kicks it
out.''
   Davis said two of the three children testified at the first
trial, and included fantastic accounts of molestation. He also said
at other stages of the case they recanted and then restated the
allegations.
   ``They will say Ray Buckey wore a beard and a mustache, flew in
an airplane. ... We will have stories of a house with seven, eight
bubble baths being taken by children all over the house, stories of
a Farmer Bill, stories of going to a ranch,'' said Davis, referring
to the previous testimony by the girls.
   When Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, finally came
to trial in 1987, what had originally been hundreds of counts of
child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared count of
conspiracy and five other defendants were dropped. The 41 children
once said to have been abused was reduced to 11.

<HEAD>Founder of Philadelphia Eye Institute Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Harold Glendon Scheie, founder and
former director of the Scheie Eye Institute of Philadelphia, died
in his sleep on Monday. He was 80 years old.
   Scheie died of cancer, said Sarah Jarvis, a spokeswoman for the
Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
   Scheie was dedicated to the advancement of ophthalmic science
and patient care for more than 55 years, and his research findings
had a profound effect on eye care throughout the world.
   Scheie was responsible for the development of key surgical
techniques, including the treatment of congenital cataracts and
glaucoma. He also helped develop the diagnostic test for myasthenia
gravis with Dr. George Gammon in the late 1930s.
   Scheie was the first to describe in detail the rare inherited
metabolic disease that can cloud the cornea, now called Scheie's
syndrome.
   Many of today's ophthalmogical instruments and procedures bear
his name, including the Scheie procedure used in glaucoma surgery.
   Dr. William N. Kelly, executive vice president of the University
of Pennsylvania and dean of the School of Medicine, described
Scheie as a pioneer in ophthalmic sciences.
   ``From the beginning of his professional career, as the
hospital's first resident in ophthalmology, it was clear that great
things would come from Harold G. Scheie,'' Kelly said. ``The Scheie
Eye Institute is but one example of his many accomplishments.''
   The institute opened in 1972 with Scheie as its director. The
total eye-care facility houses the Department of Ophthalmology of
Penn's School of Medicine and is based at Presbyterian Medical
Center of Philadelphia.
   Scheie was a native of Brookings, S.D. He graduated with honors
in 1935 from the University of Minnesota School of Medicine, and
later moved to Philadelphia.
   Scheie's interest in ophthalmic science developed during his
two-year internship at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania in 1935.
   He is survived by his wife, Mary Ann Tallman; son, Eric Scheie
of Berkeley, Calif.; and daughter, Nancy Scheie of Somerville, N.J.
   Services for Scheie were scheduled at the Arlington National
Cemetery Chapel in Arlington, Va., for March 13. A memorial service
will be held at the University of Pennsylvania on March 19.

   A teen-ager snubbed by youths playing a pickup
basketball game returned in a van with a shotgun and sprayed the
group with blasts of birdshot, wounding 10, police said Monday.
   None of the injuries were serious, although one of the players
was hit in the head and another in the back, police said. The rest
were hit in the arms, legs and upper bodies.
   All 10 were released after treatment at Jackson Memorial
Hospital.
   Police late Monday arrested Eric Leon Keaton, 19, of Miami on
charges of attempted first-degree murder and use of a firearm in
the commission of a felony in the incident, said spokesman Armando
Villorin.
   The group, which included two junior-varsity high school
players, was playing Sunday on a court Sunday outside an elementary
school when the youth, a stranger, asked to play but was told he
couldn't get into the game, witnesses told police.
   The teen left, but returned a few minutes later, riding in the
passenger seat of a small van. The van slowed as it passed within
20 feet of the court and the teen fired a shotgun twice into the
group, the witnesses said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amidullah's shoe-repair shop is a
rough wooden box in which he can barely stand erect. He is 9 years
old and has been the chief support of a large family since his
father was killed two months ago.
   In the muddy market lanes of Kabul, small boys and old men
compete for jobs pulling carts loaded with sacks of Soviet flour,
Japanese television sets and cartons of West German hand lotion.
The human mules even tow shiny red motorbikes to showrooms rather
than ride them.
   Most young men seen in the capital are in uniform. The others
usually are on crutches, their feet or entire legs lost to land
mines in a dozen years of civil war.
   In a factory outside a military base, about 1,000 women make
army uniforms. Only 20 percent are married but about 50 percent
have become pregnant, one said, shaking her head sadly. She and
others said prostitution is a disturbing new phenomenon in Kabul.
   Life has never been easy in this ancient land, whose name
conjures mystery, intrigue and adventure. Today, the traditional
hard-scrabble existence is compounded by a war that has produced
neither victor nor vanquished and won't go away.
   Afghanistan's descent into war began in 1973 when Mohammad Daoud
deposed his cousin, King Zahir Shah, while the king was abroad.
Daoud was assassinated in April 1978 in a Communist coup.
   The Kremlin sent military forces in December 1979 to rescue its
proteges from internal power struggles and a war with Moslem
guerrillas. The insurgents get most of their support from the
United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   In the 12 years since the 1978 coup, the party has changed
leaders twice by assassination and once in a power play, either
engineered or supported by the Soviets, that installed President
Najib in 1986.
   Soviet combat forces withdrew a year ago, leaving the Afghan
army to fight the guerrillas alone.
   To the surprise of the United States and others, government
troops have not merely held their own, but have expanded their area
of control, reopening supply routes and making deals with local
guerrilla commanders.
   Limited success has come at a high price.
   The government says half its resources go the war effort. In a
chaotic economy, children and teen-agers who work as manual
laborers and prostitutes earn more than their fathers, who have
government jobs, according to interviews with Kabul residents of
all social levels.
   ``I think this war is making us more backward,'' said a Kabul
professional educated in Eastern Europe, who insisted his name not
be used.
   ``The generation of 12- to 15-year-olds, they will be
illiterate. You will have a generation sick with non-education,
with heroin and hashish. This is a result of _ I don't know _ war,
revolution, government, people's hate. It's very sad.''
   In his wooden cubicle, which he opened soon after his father
died in an auto crash, barefoot Amidullah handed a pair of highly
polished black boots to a customer.
   He said he earned about 100 afghanis a day, three times what his
12-year-old brother Wahidullah makes working in a bakery. Amidullah
is the main breadwinner for his mother and his seven brothers and
sisters.
   At the unrealistic official rate, Amidullah's earnings translate
to $1.81 a day, but amount to only 20 cents at the more accurate
black market rate.
   Amidullah said the combined earnings of the two brothers were
``sometimes enough for food, sometimes not.''
   Said Omar sells rock-like lumps of brown, crudely refined sugar
at the Mujahedeen Market on Kabul's outskirts. The market got its
name because the goods sold there are from territory held by the
guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen, or holy warriors.
   Omar, 48, said he had four sons and three daughters, and
``number eight child is coming.'' He and 10-year-old Zalmai sat on
their cart of sugar, shielded from the cold rain by a tarpaulin of
bright orange.
   ``Some days I am not eating lunch, because if I eat lunch, my
family won't have food,'' Omar said.
   No one in his family has been killed or wounded in the war, but
rockets fell near his house not long ago.
   ``I am afraid of the rockets,'' he said. ``I made a sort of hole
under my house. When the rockets come, I go with my family
underground.''
   Kabul has its pockets of affluence _ of fancy houses, big cars,
lavish weddings, glitzy sweaters and acid-washed jeans.
   Mohammad Jamil, who is 42 and has four children, reckons he has
a good job because he sells cars on commission rather than working
for a salary, but times are still bad.
   ``Five years ago, we were selling and buying five or six cars a
day,'' he said. ``Just now, we can't sell one car in a month.''
   In January, he sold a 1983 Mercedes Benz to a rich merchant for
7 million afghanis ($14,000 on the black market). Jamil's 1 percent
commission brought him 70,000 afghanis ($140), or 20,000 more than
President Najib's official monthly salary.

   The chaotic development that is gobbling up the
Amazon rain forest could finally be reined in with a new plan
developed by officials of Amazon countries and leading scientists
from around the world.
   ``That's some of the most encouraging news about the Amazon rain
forest in recent years,'' said Thomas Lovejoy, a tropical ecologist
at the Smithsonian Institution and an Amazon specialist.
   ``It contrasts markedly with a year ago, when there was nothing
to read about conservation in the Amazon, especially in Brazil,
except bad news,'' Lovejoy said in a recent interview.
   Sixty percent of the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain
forest, lies in Brazil, but the forest also covers parts of eight
surrounding countries.
   Lovejoy was one of the organizers of an unusual workshop held in
mid-January in Manaus, Brazil, a sprawling city of 1 million people
in the heart of the Amazon. It was the center of Brazil's
once-thriving rubber trade.
   The workshop, which brought together all the governments and
scientists with interests in the rain forest, culminated with a
plan to regulate development in up to 80 percent of the Amazon
region.
   It was the first time that all parties concerned with the Amazon
had met to pool their knowledge and agree on conservation
priorities, the meeting's participants said.
   The plan devised at the workshop has no legal force. But it has
broad government support and is likely to serve as a guide for
national conservation programs, participants said.
   Many of the areas to be preserved will be open to so-called
multiple-use development, which preserves the forest while allowing
tourism and the commercial exploitation of fibers, fruits and
medicinal plants.
   Brazil, struggling with a teetering economy and pressured by
developers and peasant farmers to clear the forest for cattle
ranching or farming, has been ambivalent about the need to conserve
the Amazon.
   Brazil participated in the Manaus workshop, however, and the
setting of priorities was ``all done with the blessing of Brazil,''
Lovejoy said.
   Tropical rain forests are giant, living warehouses for thousands
of plant andanimal species. The Amazon alone is home to 30 percent
of the world's plant and animal species.
   One study found that a single square yard of leaf litter taken
from the deep shadows of the Amazon floor contained 800 ants
representing 50 species.
   Towering forest canopies up to 300 feet above the forest floor
are home to countless birds and insects that live their lives
without ever setting foot on the ground. One group of orchid
species grows only near the top of the canopy; an entirely
different collection of orchids grows at the bottom.
   At the Manaus meeting, more than 100 specialists met in small
groups to assess conservation priorities.
   Insect specialists compared data on such creatures as the
stinging ant that defends acacia trees against predators.
Mammologists took inventory of the Amazon's screeching monkeys.
Ichthyologists considered such oddities as the fish that eats
fallen fruits and nuts on the Amazon River's banks when it
overflows. Botanists, ornithologists and others did the same.
   Then they pooled their information and marked up maps of the
Amazon. When they were done, the areas determined to be worth
saving covered 70 percent to 80 percent of the Amazon.
   ``The bulk of the Amazon is a biological priority; there's no
way of getting around that,'' said Russell Mittermeier, president
of Conservation International and an authority on endangered
monkeys.
   Mittermeier emphasized, however, that the plan set realistic
goals for the establishment of national parks and reserves, along
with multiple-use areas where some development could occur.
   It is not realistic to build a fence around 70 percent to 80
percent of the Amazon, he said. Only the most critical areas should
be placed off limits to development.
   ``Ten to 20 percent of the entire Amazon should be in protected
parks or preserves, ideally,'' he said. At present, 2 percent of
the Amazon is protected.
   Brazil was not alone in its support for the conservation plan.
   ``The results of this meeting are a major contribution towards
the work that has got to be done,'' said Stanley Malone, director
of the Suriname Forest Service.
   Suriname was one of eight Amazon countries that agreed in 1978
to develop a unified approach to management of the Amazon, Malone
said. What the officials lacked, however, was a guide to which
areas most needed protection.
   That determination has now been made, based on the number of
different species a given area contained, and on how many of those
species were endemic, or unique, to the area.
   ``Now we'll have to see what develops from this,'' Mittermeier
said. A new Brazilian president, Fernando Collor de Mello, will be
inaugurated March 15, and with him will come a new Brazilian
environmental policy.
   Whether the policy will include support for the Manaus plan is
uncertain. ``As always, everything depends on key individuals,''
Mittermeier said.
   ``I'm basically always optimistic,'' he said. ``I feel sure that
we can develop appropriate solutions, although it may take a lot of
work.''

<TEXT>
   A Texas Racing Commission official and his
family were found apparently shot to death in their home,
authorities said.
   David Joost, 41-year-old director of administration for the
Texas Racing Commission, was discovered dead Monday at the home in
Buda, near Austin, along with his 35-year-old wife, Susan, and
their children, Eric, 10, and Laura, 5.
   Sheriff Paul Hastings said it appeared all four died of gunshot
wounds but that a cause of death would not be released until
autopsies today.
   A revolver was found in the home, but Hastings would not
speculate on whether it had been used in the shootings. There was
no sign of forced entry at the home.
   ``I don't want to have any suggestion that this is a
murder-suicide, because we don't know,'' Hastings said. ``All we
have is a family who has apparently met death by violent means. We
could have four murders.''
   Joost, who handled administrative duties for the Racing
Commission, failed to show up at a commission meeting Monday
morning. A co-worker and a constable went to the home, about 10
miles south of Austin, just before noon.
   The body of Mrs. Joost, an employee of the surface mining and
reclamation division of the Texas Railroad Commission, was found in
the master bedroom in bed with her daughter. The son's body was in
his bedroom and Joostf's in a bathroom.
   Sheriff's spokeswoman Laura Vasquez said Sunday and Monday
newspapers in the driveway led investigators to believe the family
had been dead more than 24 hours.
   Racing commission spokeswoman Angie Roberts said the agency had
no comment on the deaths.
   She did say Joost not named in a $1 billion lawsuit filed
against the commission Feb. 23 by the Houston Turf Club.
   The club, which was spurned in its bid to win a license to build

   North Carolina's 84 death row inmates won't
go free, but many of their lives could be spared under a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling overturning a key part of the state's
death-penalty law, authorities said.
   The court Monday set aside the death sentence of Dock McKoy Jr.
for the 1984 murder of a deputy sheriff because under the state
law, the sentencing jury couldn't consider any mitigating factor,
or one that might lessen the sentence, unless all 12 jurors agreed.
   Writing for the court, Justice Thurgood Marshall said the
unanimity requirement is unconstitutional. Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor
dissented in the 6-3 vote.
   ``The opinion itself is just very sweeping,'' said Gordon
Widenhouse, assistant appellate defender for the state. ``We're
ecstatic.''
   ``The decision does not mean that any death row inmates will go
free, but it does mean that as many as 70 convicted murderers must
have new sentencing hearings,'' Attorney General Lacy Thornburg
said. ``It means in each case that another jury will be required to
again decide the appropriate punishment.''
   Eighty-two men are on death row at Central Prison in Raleigh and
two women have been sentenced to die at the N.C. Correctional
Institution for Women, also in Raleigh, said Bill Poston, a state
Department of Correction spokesman.
   Poston said officers at Central Prison gave word of the ruling
to several of the inmates and asked them to spread the news. Poston
said none of the inmates had expressed a reaction Monday.
   The state attorney general's office believes the ruling should
affect only defendants who received death sentences beginning in
1985, said Jim Coman, senior deputy attorney general. ``But I'm
sure all the attorneys for all the death row inmates will appeal,''
he said.
   Thornburg said he would ask the Legislature to re-examine the
death penalty law ``and make changes that will make the sentence of
death more enforceable.''
   Malcolm Hunter Jr., the state appellate defender who challenged
the North Carolina law, said he had not yet spoken with McKoy. But
he said he was not sure McKoy is ``really able to appreciate it.
... He's over 70, in very poor mental, emotional and physical
health. He's sort of a pathetic creature right now.''
   McKoy was convicted of shooting Anson County Deputy Sheriff
William Kress Horne three days before Christmas 1984.
   Neighbors reported that McKoy was drinking and shooting, and the
sheriff's department responded once and asked him to stop. When
deputies were called to the house a second time, deputies asked
McKoy to step outside.
   Instead, he opened a screen door and fired his gun, shooting
Horne, who was standing behind his patrol car with his pistol drawn.
   At his trial, McKoy had offered an insanity defense.

<HEAD>Expert Sets off Legal Debate With Opinion that Ship Could Have
Sunk</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Exxon Valdez would have sunk in
just over an hour if Joseph Hazelwood had moved it off a reef after
it ran aground, an expert witness said over defense protests the
testimony was irrelevant.
   Lawyers for the skipper argued that the grounded tanker was
immovable after it hit a reef last March 24 and there was no risk
it would capsize.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone, while indicating he agreed
the tanker was solidly stuck, allowed the testimony Monday. He said
jurors had already heard too much about the skipper's alleged
efforts to move the ship to be told now to disregard it.
   William Vorus, a professor of naval architecture at the
University of Michigan, gave jurors an elaborate account of a
computer simulation of the grounding, as well as a scholarly
dissertation on how a ship stays afloat.
   The witness, who said his engineering firm was being paid
$40,000 by the state for its work on the prosecution, calculated
the Exxon Valdez would have capsized 75 minutes after grounding if
it had been freed from the reef in 10 minutes.
   Hazelwood, 43, is charged with criminal mischief, reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. The seaman from Huntington, N.Y., faces up to 7\
years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude, devastating the rich population of wildlife in Prince
William Sound and coating hundreds of miles of rocky shore with
black goo in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The most serious charge against Hazelwood, criminal mischief,
involves acting recklessly in disregarding a known risk.
   Deputy District Attorney Brent Cole has focused on Hazelwood's
behavior after the grounding to prove this charge with witnesses
saying the skipper ordered the engines turned on and the ship
pointed forward.
   But in a brief filed with the judge Monday, defense attorney
Dick Madson argued that there was no risk that the ship would come
off the reef or capsize and that Hazelwood could not have
disregarded a risk that didn't exist.
   Johnstone said testimony from prosecution witnesses has
convinced him that the ship was hard aground on the reef and could
not be moved off by its own power.
   ``My inclination now is that physical impossibility is not
evidence of the crime of criminal mischief,'' the judge said in a
hearing outside the jury's presence. He said he would make a final
ruling later.
   But he refused to block prosecution testimony on the issue after
Cole argued that Hazelwood's actions could relate to whether his
judgment was impaired by alcohol.
   The Alaska statute covering criminal mischief says that a person
may act recklessly if he is unaware of a risk because of
intoxication. Cole did not explain how that provision would operate
if no risk was involved.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos objected that Vorus' testimony
was ``sheer speculation,'' but the judge overruled him.

<TEXT>
   A state lawmaker on Tuesday withstood a
recall election brought by opponents of Indian spearfishing,
handily defeating his challenger.
   Democratic Rep. James Holperin, the first state lawmaker to face
a recall since 1932, had 9,535 votes or 69 percent to 4,380 or 31
percent for Sayner businessman Gene Ahlborn with all precincts
reporting, unofficial returns showed.
   Holperin takes on Republican Brian Sherren, a St. Germain resort
and recreational vehicle park owner, on April 3. Sherren, although
running unopposed in the GOP primary, garnered 601 votes.
   Earlier, Holperin said the voter turnout would be critical. The
recall election was brought by opponents of spearfishing rights for
Wisconsin's Chippewa Indians.
   ``I am very pleased with the outcome. ... It is not a foregone
conclusion that this is a guarantee of victory in April,'' Holperin
told reporters at his campaign headquarters.
   Holperin said he was reluctant to read too much into the special
election victory, saying it only showed voters want him on the
ballot next month and believed in the normal cycle of elections
rather than recalls.
   The recall was sparked by critics of Indian spearfishing, a
right federal courts have said the state's six Chippewa bands
retained in 19th-century treaties with the U.S. government.
   The issue has caused years of unrest, uncertainty and tension in
northern Wisconsin between Indians, who want to exercise a legal
right, and non-Indians, who complain their livelihoods are being
destroyed.
   Organizers of the recall said Holperin, a four-term incumbent,
had lost touch with his constituents on the issue and had failed to
help reach an agreement to end the dispute.
   The city clerk in Rhinelander, the largest town in Holperin's
district, which encompasses Vilas and Oneida counties, said about
21 percent of the eligible voters had cast ballots by mid-afternoon.

   The recall has its roots in a 1983 federal court ruling that
said Wisconsin's six Chippewa bands retained the right to
spearfish, hunt, cut timber and gather food on off-reservation
public lands under 19th-century treaties that ceded northern
Wisconsin to the U.S. government. The ruling is under appeal.
   Vilas and Oneida counties have been the scene of angry
confrontations between non-Indians and Chippewa spearfishermen
during tribal fishing seasons of recent years.
   Organizers of the recall were especially critical of Holperin's
support last year for Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's plan to
lease the treaty rights of the Lac du Flambeau Chippewa band for 10
years.
   The Lac du Flambeau would have received $50 million worth of
cash and other aid in exchange for curtailing the exercise of
treaty rights. Tribal members rejected the plan in a vote last fall.
   Holperin, 39, a former radio and television newscaster, was
elected to the Assembly in 1982.
   Ahlborn, 50, became a Democrat in 1976. He is a buyer for a
family-owned business that sells chainsaw supplies to retailers. He
has served on the Vilas County Board of Supervisors since 1983 and
was elected to the Northland Pines School District in Eagle River
in 1981.
   The recall was organized by a group called Stop Treaty
Abuse-Wisconsin, which claims that Indian treaties are unfair
because they give Indians unequal rights.
   No state representative has ever been successfuly recalled in
Wisconsin. The last recall election was in 1932, when Republican
Sen. Otto Mueller of Wausau retained his seat.

<HEAD>Italian Communists Hold Congress To Consider Renewal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Italian Communists spurred by the collapse of
communism in Eastern Europe want to set their party on a new course
this week, one their leader believes can ultimately unite Italy's
fractured political left.
   An 1,100-delegate extraordinary congress of the Italian
Communist Party meets Wednesday through Saturday in Bologna to
consider party leader Achille Occhetto's proposal for a rebirth of
the largest Communist Party in the West.
   Occhetto is calling for, in effect, creating a broad new party
that will seek to unite Italy's leftist parties under a single
umbrella and effectively challenge the dominant Christian Democrats.
   The Communists are Italy's second-largest party but have been
kept out of the national government for more than 42 years.
   Despite bitter opposition from the party's old guard, Occhetto's
plan seems to have the support of about 67 percent of the
delegates. That's more than enough votes to assure him success and
perhaps lead the party to adopt a new name and drop the hammer and
sickle from its symbol.
   In November, just days after the Berlin Wall crumbled, Occhetto
stunned Italian Communists when, without consulting other party
leaders, he suggested the party change its name and set out on ``a
new street to unify the forces of progress.''
   The party's Central Committee, instead of adopting his proposal,
called for the extraordinary congress and decided to leave the
decision to the delegates in Bologna.
   For Occhetto, the rebirth of the party is a gamble aimed at
reversing its sagging political fortunes. The Christian Democrats
have led or dominated all Italian governments since World War II.
   Occhetto hopes a rebirth of the 1.4 million-member party would
move it closer to the ideas of the Greens, the Radical Party and
liberal Catholics, thus creating a new political force.
   ``Divisions among leftists have caused the permanent victory of
the Christian Democrats,'' he said in November.
   Occhetto also would like that force eventually to include
Italy's Socialist Party, the country's third largest.
   But the Socialists don't feel the same pressures. They have been
coalition partners with the Christian Democrats for the last decade.
   Socialist leader Bettino Craxi, watching the steady electoral
slide of the Italian Communists, has campaigned to lead his party
past the Communists in the polls. If he succeeds, the Socialists
will become the second largest party and the de facto leader of the
Italian left.

<HEAD>China's Shandong Province Requires VD Tests for Job-Seekers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largely rural Chinese province of Shandong
has enacted new regulations requiring all job applicants to undergo
tests for venereal disease, an official newspaper reported today.
   The regulations were drawn up after the coastal province
recorded 2,690 cases of VD in 1989, a more than fourfold increase
over the previous year, the China Daily said.
   Authorities may now require all applicants for jobs in state or
collectively-run enterprises to prove they are free of venereal
diseases, and can ask health centers to carry out VD tests on
prostitutes, criminals and vagrants.
   Couples will be allowed to marry only after proving they are
VD-free, the report said. Doctors may not give private treatment to
VD patients without the authorization of local health offices.
   The daily said the rise of extra-marital sex was the main reason
for the rapid spread of VD in the province.
   China in 1964 announced it had eliminated VD from the country,
but has acknowledged that sexual diseases have made a strong
comeback in the 1980s as a result of increased contact with the
outside world, a revival of prostitution and changing attitudes
toward sex.
   The nation has recorded more than 200,000 cases of VD since the
early 1980s, with the southern provinces bordering Hong Kong,
China's most open areas, among the hardest hit.
   But the spread of VD is also being taken seriously in more
remote areas such as Shandong, which has relatively few direct
contacts with the outside world.
   The national government now requires all foreigners taking up
residency in China to show proof they are free from VD and AIDS.
Chinese returning from three months or more abroad must also show
documents they are not infected by the diseases.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the roar of rock music and the glare of
spotlights, the world's top windsurfers have moved indoors to prove
they no longer depend on nature's breezes. Switch on the fans, and
off they go.
   Combining theatrical glitz, engineering wizardry and high-level
sporting skills, organizers lured 10,000 spectators Monday night _
at more than $20 a head _ to watch the world's first indoor
windsurfing competition on a miniature ocean in Paris' largest
sports arena.
   The sideboards and concrete flooring that normally contain the
ice skating rink at Bercy arena were lined with a bright blue
plastic sheet and filled with 5.55 million gallons of water.
   Twenty massive circular fans, weighing a ton each, were placed
along one side of the basin, producing a wind of more than 20 knots
that kept two large flags in the facing grandstands flapping
vigorously.
   The basin was 230 feet long, 98 feet wide and only 27 inches
deep. Judo mats under the lining cushioned the windsurfers when
they fell, which was often.
   The competition, to conclude tonight, includes both slalom races
and a jumping event, using a ramp equipped with plastic rollers to
allow smooth passage for the boards.
   American star Robby Niash, recipient of the loudest cheers
during the introductions, had said following an afternoon practice
session that the jumping would be a ``bad joke'' because the
competitors had only a small fraction of the usual space they need
to pick up speed.
   But Niash looked happier after easily winning his first slalom
heat over three other racers, two of whom promptly capsized when
the race began with a slide down four side-by-side ramps.
   The competitors _ 10 women and 24 men _ came from throughout
Western Europe, as well as Canada, Australia and the United States.
   Plans for the event were first announced April 1 in a French
windsurfing magazine, and at the time roused suspicions that it was
an April Fools hoax.
   But skeptics underestimated the persistence of chief organizer
Frederic Beauchene, whose earlier exploits included a windsurf
across the English Channel and later, in tandem with a partner, a
trans-Atlantic crossing.
   Beauchene began contemplating the idea of indoor windsurfing
while running a weather-plagued world championship in France in
1982.
   ``We had enough wind only one day out of 10,'' he said. ``The
racers are frustrated, the spectators also. The sport is
inconsiderate.''
   The indoor alternative not only solves the wind problem,
Beauchene notes, but facilitates television coverage and makes the
sport accessible to people in inland cities such as Paris. He hopes
the Bercy competition will lead to a full-fledged international
indoor circuit that would include West Germany, Holland, Japan and
the United States.
   The German-made fans were switched on two-by-two, introduced by
the master of ceremonies with almost as much fanfare as the racers.
Marco Lebaron, the chief engineer, had said earlier that the surge
of power needed to switch all 20 fans on simultaneously could cause
an explosion.
   The volume of water in the basin is so vast that it cannot all
be pumped directly into the nearby Seine river in time for a horse
jumping show at Bercy on Wednesday. Instead, the water will be
allowed to flood several basement rooms, then removed gradually.
   Whether indoor windsurfing turns out to be a transitory gimmick
or a legitimate boost for an exciting but not widely followed
sport, only time will tell. But it certainly poses new challenges
for the competitors.
   A French sports magazine, Le Sport, quoted one unidentified
racer as saying this would be the first time he would be able to
hear boos if he did badly.

   Iustinian Dondera looked over his
wares _ five bars of soap, three videocassettes, two bags of coffee
and a toy car _ and contemplated the joys of capitalism.
   ``There are many more people selling, and better products,'' he
said, gesturing to vendors hunched over car hoods spread with goods.
   ``This is really business,'' he added, grinning.
   Dondera was one of hundreds of people selling blue jeans,
ladies' underwear, deodorant and other impossible-to-find items at
a weekend flea market on the edge of Bucharest.
   It is one of three weekly flea markets that have sprung to life
in the capital in recent weeks and the most obvious sign of free
enterprise to emerge since the December overthrow of dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``Before, the police would confiscate everything,'' added
Dondera's companion, who identified himself only as Dan. ``Now they
don't do that.''
   In the Ghencea neighborhood on the outskirts of Bucharest, the
government charges vendors 13 lei, the equivalent of 65 cents, to
set up a stand in the old dirt market area. But hundreds of other
people set up shop outside the market gates without paying, choking
a mile-long stretch of road.
   On car hoods or on blankets on the ground, sellers lay out U.S.
cigarettes, John Travolta record albums, Bulgarian chocolates and
car parts.
   One young man offered labels with the names of Italian
designers. ``To give clothes more value,'' he explained.
   The stalls were jammed by thousands of Romanians who must
normally wait in long lines for the few consumer items available in
shops.
   Gabriel Toma, 22, stood patiently as his girlfriend held up
blue-jean skirts from a selection on a car trunk.
   ``We don't find things in the stores so we are here,'' he said.
``But it's more expensive than it should be, of course, and the
quality is not always right.''
   Nonetheless, he held up a prize: a box of a dozen colors of eye
shadow, a rare find in Bucharest shops.
   Some vendors sold their old clothes or books. Others confessed
to having developed private channels to get the imported goods long
denied Romanians under Ceausescu's export-driven plans to pay off
the country's foreign debt.
   Mircea, a young man in a black sweater and red, silky
sweatpants, explained that he had driven to Turkey to buy blue
jeans, which he was now selling for 1,200 lei (about $60) a pair
out of his trunk.
   He said he and his partner earned a profit of $15 a pair.
   ``I must live,'' he said. ``In the factory I earn 2,500 lei
($125) a month. That's nothing.''
   Down the road, 27-year-old Manuela Brenner was ordering a
potential customer to smell the Hungarian soap she was selling from
a cardboard stand.
   ``You won't find that in the stores,'' her husband Radu advised
the customer. The couple said they had driven to western Romania,
near the Hungarian border, to find toiletries they could sell to
supplement their incomes.
   ``If you only knew how I got hold of them. It was very
difficult,'' Mrs. Brenner admonished the customer as he tried to
negotiate a lower price.
   She told a reporter that people were adapting quickly to being
merchants, even though they had lived in a highly centralized
economy for four decades.
   ``Romanians have the idea of business in their blood,'' she
beamed.
   Recently, the centralized economic system has begun to crack.
The ruling Provisional Council of National Unity decreed last month
that private businesses could be established with up to 20
employees.
   The government has declared that it intends to introduce more
market forces to turn around a ravaged economy. However, major
measures are not expected before May elections.
   But at Sunday's market, capitalism was settling in well, with
vendors as excited as buyers.
   One man worked his way through the swarms of buyers thrusting a
single black lace bra into women's faces.
   ``Only 150 lei,'' he declared, about $7.
   Another man waved a yellow polyester blouse.
``One-hundred-percent cotton.'' He yelled. ``No, 1,000-percent
cotton.''
   Brenner interrupted a reporter trying to question the customer
examining the Hungarian soap.
   ``Business first,'' he said briskly. ``Time is money.''

   Twenty-nine coal barges broke loose and three
of them sank Monday after hitting the older of the two Greater New
Orleans Bridge twin spans over the Mississippi River.
   ``Twenty-six are floating free and being rounded up by five or
more tugs. So far, some have drifted down as far as the Industrial
Canal _ about 3| or four miles,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Bob Carson.
   He said the bridge and river remained open. Damage to the bridge
apparently was confined to the system designed to keep boats away
from the bridge, he said.
   ``I doubt that the actual bridge abutments were touched,'' said
Carson.
   The barges were under tow by the tugboat Lillian Clark when the
accident occurred about 7 p.m., Carson said.

<TEXT>
   The Congressional Budget Office says next
year's deficit will be twice what President Bush is estimating, but
the red ink will go down sharply in the next few years if Congress
adopts all of the president's proposals.
   A new report by the CBO, a non-partisan agency, predicts the
deficit for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 will be about $131
billion under Bush's plan, nearly $70 billion more than the White
House predicts.
   The administration budget is too optimistic in its forecast of
economic conditions and interest rates and it fails to include a
short-term cash infusion needed for the cleanup of the savings and
loan industry next year, the CBO said.
   As a result of the S&amp;L costs, the congressional agency estimated
Monday that the fiscal 1991 deficit will be $161 billion if no
deficit-cutting action is taken, up from $138 billion it estimated
in January.
   The White House said its program would reduce the deficit to
about $61 billion, far less than the CBO's $131 billion. But that
is based on its estimate of a deficit of only about $100 billion
before deficit-cutting action is taken.
   The administration, in its budget submitted in January, did not
include additional costs for the thrift buyouts.
   Barbara Clay, spokeswoman for the president's Office of
Management and Budget, said that cost would be factored into the
administration's midyear budget update in July. But OMB might not
agree with the $26 billion additional cost estimate of the CBO, she
said.
   The CBO said its estimate of the deficit-reduction value of
Bush's budget was about $31 billion, some $6 billion less than
claimed by the White House. One big difference is that the CBO
estimates the president's tax increase proposals are worth $9.4
billion, compared with $15.7 billion in the administration estimate.
   CBO Director Robert Reischauer said the $31 billion in deficit
reduction would put the government on a path toward a balanced
budget, even if not as quickly as Bush claims.
   ``By historical standards, that is a great deal more than we
have achieved in recent years,'' he said.
   The CBO projects the budget will be near balance by fiscal 1995,
two years later than the administration's forecast, if Bush's
program is adopted.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman law, Congress and the administration are
required to reduce the deficit in fiscal 1991 to $64 billion or
less. The administration produces the estimates that determine
whether that target is met. The CBO estimates are advisory.

<HEAD>Chicken Skin in McNuggets? Consumer Group Seeks Ingredient
Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you really want to know that your
cheeseburger contains 711 calories and there's chicken skin in your
McNugget, it may soon be easier to find out.
   Fast-food companies are under pressure from a consumer group
insisting that four large chains honor a 1986 nutrition disclosure
agreement.
   Consumers need to know that McDonald's and Burger King fry their
potatoes in beef fat, says Michael Jacobson, executive director of
the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   They need to know that McDonald's Chicken McNuggets contain
ground-up chicken skin, that Burger King's Whopper with cheese
contains 711 calories and that milkshakes often contain artificial
colorings, said Jacobson, whose group is enlisting help from
officials in three states.
   ``This is the first complaint that we've received,'' Burger King
spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said after learning that product
information brochures were available at only six of 14 outlets
surveyed by the Washington-based center.
   ``We certainly believe our consumers should know what they're
eating,'' she added. ``We provide guides to all of our restaurants.
We certainly will go back and take a look ourselves and, if they
are not being given out, remedy the situation.''
   The center, a nonprofit health advocacy group with 200,000
members, outlined its complaints on Monday against Burger King,
McDonald's, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   In letters to the attorneys general of California, New York and
Texas, Jacobson said the chains are violating a 1986 agreement to
give customers on-the-spot information about ingredients and
nutrition and make sure customers know the booklets are available.
   The agreement worked out with the three state officials was
supposed to apply to outlets nationwide, according to the center.
   ``We are sorry to report ... that, after initial compliance, the
voluntary program has broken down,'' Jacobson said in the letter.
Based on a survey of eight states and the District of Columbia, he
said, only Jack in the Box appears to be honoring the agreement.
   Jacobson urged the attorneys general to consider prosecuting the
companies if they don't fully comply within 60 days.
   The four chains have been invited to meet with Texas Attorney
General Jim Mattox and talk about the problem.
   ``We want them to continue providing nutritional information,''
said Mattox spokesman Ron Dusek. ``Whether or not the states would
be inclined to sue over the violations of this agreement, I don't
know.''
   ``We are dismayed that the fast food companies have chosen to
drop this policy and we'd like to see it returned,'' said Leslie
Gersing, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Robert Abrams.
But she added, ``This is something we'd like to do without having
to resort to legislation.''
   Denny Lynch, a spokesman for Wendy's, said the company has not
discontinued a policy of offering menu information, although none
was available at any of the 14 outlets surveyed by the center.
   ``They might have run out of them,'' Lynch said. ``That's easily
fixed. We'll just remind our restaurant operators that the
ingredient and nutrition brochures are available and ask them to
have a supply on hand.''
   Only three of 13 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in the survey
had nutrition pamphlets on hand. Spokesman Dick Detwiler said that
was because a new, updated booklet was being published at the time
of the survey. He said the pamphlet has been distributed to
company-owned stores and those franchises that want to provide it.
   Terri Capatosto, a spokeswoman for McDonald's, said her company
never agreed to anything except a one-year distribution of
nutrition information in New York in 1986.
   However, she said McDonald's current national policy is to have
complete product information available and booklets are sent to
restaurants regularly. The center found brochures available at
eight of 18 outlets and concluded that the policy ``is being
ignored by many of their stores.''
   The consumer group reached its conclusions after surveying
restaurants in Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio, Wyoming, New Mexico,
Texas, California and New York in addition to Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>House Democratic Leader Proposes First Direct US Aid to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is time for the United States to begin
providing direct aid to the Soviet Union to encourage political and
economic change and to abandon President Bush's ``timid posture,''
House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt said today.
   ``America must think creatively and act boldly,'' the 1988
presidential candidate said in a speech prepared for a meeting of
the liberal Center for National Policy.
   ``We should be investing in our own self-interest. And
stability, democracy and a market economy in the Soviet Union are
in America's strong self-interest,'' he said.
   The proposal seemed certain to spark debate on Capitol Hill,
where lawmakers have been pressing for increased aid to other
countries emerging from the shadow of Moscow's domination but have
not ventured to propose immediate direct aid to the Soviet Union
itself.
   Gephardt, D-Mo., proposed starting with a ``Food for Freedom''
program to send U.S. food aid to the Soviets.
   The United States also should waive trade restrictions with
Moscow, including those on high-technology exports, and provide
guarantees for businesses that want to invest in the Soviet Union,
he said.
   Gephardt noted an appeal by President Vaclav Havel of
Czechoslovakia, made in a Feb. 21 speech to Congress, to help his
country by helping the Soviet Union continue on its reformist road.
   If Havel, who was imprisoned by the communists, can call for aid
to the Soviets, ``the least we can do is listen,'' Gephardt said in
a speech that also contained his harshest criticism to date of
Bush's policy toward Eastern Europe.
   ``A stronger Soviet economy will facilitate the process of
peace,'' said Gephardt. ``How can the Soviets pull Red Army troops
out of Eastern Europe if they have no jobs and no homes for them to
return to in Russia?''
   Direct U.S. aid is possible now because ``the Cold War as we
have known it for four decades is over,'' Gephardt said. While the
possibility remains that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
could be ousted or his reforms could fail, superpower competition
in arms and influence has changed in fundamental ways, he said.
   The United States since May 1985 has sold 20 million metric tons
of U.S.-grown wheat to the Soviet Union under subsidies worth
hundreds of millions of dollars, but has never provided direct aid
of the kind Gephardt proposed.
   The Bush administration, in its budget for the year that begins
Oct. 1, has proposed an additional $300 million in unspecified aid
to emerging East European democracies. Gephardt said the amount
should be at least $500 million, ``and that is only the beginning.''
   ``If we have the fortitude and the determination to seize the
day,'' he said, ``we can ensure that the days of the Cold War will
never return.''
   But he accused Bush of ``a lack of leadership in this most
crucial moment,'' throwing billions into the military budget to
defend against ``communists who don't want to be communists any
more'' while ignoring their economic needs.
   ``It's as though George Bush's Pentagon budget were written by
someone who hadn't read a newspaper in a year,'' Gephardt said.
Most of the administration's budget was drafted last year, after
the opening of the Berlin Wall but before many of the other
dramatic developments in Eastern Europe.
   ``I believe the answer lies in the president's lack of vision,''
Gephardt said. Americans seem reluctant to provide aid to Eastern
Europe ``because their president is not leading them,'' he said.
``He is not helping them understand the new world we live in _ its
challenges, its opportunities, its dangers.''
   Gephardt added: ``His timid posture may well create a
self-fulfilling prophecy that at best confirms the status quo and
at worst condemns the fragile new democracies to failure.''

   John Poindexter's low public profile compared
with that of Oliver North is making it a relatively simple task to
select a jury for the former national security adviser's
Iran-Contra trial.
   Seventeen women and four men were sent into a pool of
prospective jurors in the first day of jury selection Monday. Only
six people were disqualified, largely because they had too much
familiarity with the Iran-Contra scandal.
   At North's trial last year, it took more than a week to select a
jury, primarily because so many prospective jurors had been exposed
to North's televised testimony to Congress in which the former
White House aide admitted many of the activities that eventually
led to criminal charges against him.
   Like North, Poindexter gave public testimony to Congress under a
grant of immunity, but some prospective jurors could not recognize
him in the courtroom Monday.
   ``He's the handsome man here with the glasses and moustache,''
defense attorney Richard Beckler told a potential juror at one
point, beckoning toward his client seated across the room.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene took care of the problem of
exposure to Poindexter's immunized testimony before jury selection
began. The judge excused 76 potential jurors who said on a
questionnaire that they had been exposed to Poindexter's testimony.
   Those 76 came from a total of 206 potential jurors. In the North
case, all but 16 of the first 54 potential jurors indicated they
had some familiarity with North's testimony on Capitol Hill.
   Twelve jurors and six alternates will be drawn for the
Poindexter trial from a pool of at least 40.
   Greene included in the jury pool a former Bush campaign aide who
years ago had been babysat by one of Poindexter's attorneys.
   ``Just because counsel babysat for her doesn't cast any doubt on
her,'' the judge said.
   Among the six who were disqualified was a Food and Drug
Administration employee who said he had heard that North's
secretary, Fawn Hall, shredded documents in the scandal. Hall is
expected to testify at Poindexter's trial.
   ``If someone is shredding documents, they don't want me to know
about it,'' said the man. ``If they don't want me to know about it,
I want to know why they are shredding.''
   Others sent into the jury pool include a postal employee who
recalled Poindexter's name from North's trial last year; a retired
police officer who said he would treat former President Reagan's
testimony the same as that of any other witness; and a registered
nurse who said she understood Poindexter had been indicted on
charges of defrauding the government in connection with arms sales.
   Poindexter actually is under indictment on charges of
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements. The charges relate to Poindexter's alleged
coverup of North's secret resupply network to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua and to Poindexter's alleged lies concerning a November
1985 shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   Reagan gave videotaped testimony for Poindexter's trial Feb.
16-17 and Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay it in court.

<HEAD>Jewish Leader: Bush Not Ruling Out Jewish Residents in East
Jerusalem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is offering assurances that he
is not adopting a new policy that would rule out Jewish residents
in the eastern half of Jerusalem, a U.S. Jewish leader says.
   Seymour Reich, a New York lawyer who is president of B'nai
B'rith and head of the Conference of American Jewish Organizations,
said Monday night that Bush ``did acknowledge that it might have
been unfortunate for him to have referred to East Jerusalem in the
same reference to settlers on the West Bank'' at a news conference
last Saturday.
   Reich spoke with Bush by telephone for 25 minutes on Monday.
Afterward, the White House issued a statement urging American
Jewish leaders to help promote a pre-election dialogue between
Israelis and Palestinians as soon as possible.
   ``This remains the surest path available to promoting a peace
that would ensure Israeli security and the legitimate political
rights of Palestinians,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said.
   Members of Reich's conference were disturbed by Bush's comment
Saturday that, ``We do not believe there should be new settlements
in the West Bank or in East Jerusalem.''
   Reich, interviewed by telephone, said, ``Any suggestion that
East Jerusalem can be compared with settlements in the West Bank
was very disturbing.'' The word ``settlement'' had never before
been used in connection with Jerusalem, he said.
   The West Bank and East Jerusalem were captured from Jordan in
the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem has been united with the
rest of the city, which Israel made its capital, but the West Bank
has been administered separately, with Jordan paying the salaries
of local government employees there until 1988.
   ``There are no settlements in Jerusalem,'' Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir said Sunday, though 120,000 Jews now live there.
   Negotiations on the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
captured from Egypt in 1967, between Israel and Palestinians have
been a longtime aim of U.S. policy.
   The White House statement said Bush ``also reiterated that U.S.
policy toward Jerusalem is unchanged,'' with the United States
supporting ``a united Jerusalem whose final status is determined by
negotiations.''
   Reich called attention to the next sentence in the White House
statement:
   ``The president also made clear the U.S. support for Jews, as
well as others, to live there in the context of a negotiated
settlement.''
   ``The implication is that East Jerusalem is different from
settlements in the West Bank,'' said Reich.
   The United States has long opposed Israel's policy of settling
Jewish families in the West Bank.
   Fitzwater said the United States would oppose any efforts to
frustrate the right of Soviet Jews to move to Israel.
   Bush indicated again that the United States will back a $400
million loan guarantee for housing the Soviet refugees ``provided
the United States and Israel can work out assurances that satisfy
the United States on settlement activity,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States has said it will not help out if the Israeli
government settles immigrants from the Soviet Union in the West
Bank.
   Shamir and his governing Likud Party have been divided over
whether to accept the U.S. proposal for peace talks between
Israelis and Palestinians.
   The Likud ministers in the Israeli Cabinet gave conditional
approval Monday to going ahead. The chief condition was that the
positions of the Likud and its political rival and coalition
partner, the Labor Party, be coordinated in any talks with
Palestinians in Cairo.
   A new complication arose when Palestinian leaders in the
occupied territories said Monday no one would serve on a delegation
to negotiate with israel unless the Palestine Liberation
Organization chose the delegation. Israel refuses to deal with the
PLO on the grounds that it is a terrorist organization bent on the
destruction of Israel.

<HEAD>US Ambassador Recalled From Guatemala</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. ambassador to Guatemala is in
Washington, called back temporarily to signal U.S. dismay with the
government's failure to stop a mounting wave of political killings.
   Ambassador Tom Stroock arrived Monday for one week of
consultations with Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other
officials. When he returns to Guatemala City he will be carrying a
message to President Vinicio Cerezo, said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   ``We are highlighting ... today by what I believe is a very
strong, forthright statement'' of U.S. concern with the stalled
investigations of the killings, many of which were directed at
left-wing activists, she said.
   ``We believe that these investigations should be given the
highest priority and that all investigative-type resources should
be directed toward bringing to justice those individuals who are
guilty,'' Ms. Tutwiler added.
   The FBI has sent forensic experts to Guatemala to help in the
investigations.
   While the United States has ``provided substantial assistance to
increase the investigative capacity of the police and the judicial
system, the perpetrators have still not ... been subjected to the
rule of law,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``Given this situation, the secretary of state has requested
that Ambassador Stroock return to the United States to review the
situation.''
   Guatemalan government spokeswoman Claudia Arenas Bianchi said in
a telephone interview in Guatemala City: ``There is no temporary
withdrawal of Ambassador Stroock. He only left for meetings at the
Department of State.''
   Cerezo and his Christian Democrats blame a rightist campaign to
destabilize the government, including two coup attempts last year
by army officers. But foreign diplomats and government critics
blame Cerezo for incompetence and say he is paralyzed by fear of
right-wing violence.
   The United States wants an investigation into last summer's
killings of five university students and several left-wing
activists, including one American.
   Many of the 77 politically motivated killings listed by human
rights groups since last summer have been attributed to right-wing
activists. Some foreign diplomats say the methods in some of the
killings point to involvement by state security forces.
   But Ms. Tutwiler said the United States does not know who is
responsible.
   ``Guatemala's democracy continues to be challenged by acts of
terrorism and human rights abuses perpetrated by extremists who
seek to undermine the democratically elected civilian government,''
the spokeswoman said.
   ``The United States government condemns these acts in the
strongest terms and reiterates its fundamental support for the
government of Guatemala and for the peaceful transition through
open and free elections to a new civilian government next year,''
she said.
   The violence in Guatemala has dimmed hopes that a working
democracy can take root in the central American country.
   Guatemala returned to civilian government in 1986 after three
decades of military rule in which an estimated 100,000 people died
and 40,000 disappeared. The country's previous experience with
democracy ended in 1954 with a CIA-backed coup against reformist
President Jacobo Arbenz.
   ``The Guatemalan people deserve nothing less than what so many
other nations of the hemisphere have achieved: an open, democratic
system in which the rule of law is enforced and the rights and
liberties of all Guatemalans are protected,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Lenders to Offer Cross Between Fixed-Rate and ARM Mortgages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many lenders will soon offer a new type of
mortgage designed to appeal to home buyers who expect to move
within seven years but want the security of a fixed-rate mortgage
in case they don't.
   The loans, called two-step mortgages, are a cross between an
adjustable-rate loan, where the rate can change every one, three or
five years, and a traditional 30-year mortgage, where the interest
rate does not change for the life of the loan.
   In the first step of the new mortgage, borrowers pay an interest
rate up to three-eighths of a percentage point lower than on a
30-year, fixed-rate loan. After seven years, the rate is reset at
2.25 to 2.5 percentage points higher than the rate on 10-year
Treasury notes.
   On a typical mortgage of $83,000, home buyers currently would
save $23 a month, or $1,932 over the first seven years. However,
the rate for the remaining 23 years of the mortgage likely would be
somewhat higher than on a new 30-year loan taken out at
readjustment time.
   For instance, if the rate on a 7-year-old, two-step loan were
readjusted now, it would be 10.75 percent to 11 percent _ one-half
to three-quarters of a percentage point higher than fixed 30-year
mortgages.
   But in this case, unlike a refinancing, the borrower would pay
no additional fees or charges at readjustment time.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said
it would begin buying two-step mortgages from a handful of lenders
today. It said it expected them to be widely available later in the
spring.
   ``It's a mortgage designed for the 1990s,'' said Fannie Mae
President Roger E. Birk. ``In this mobile society, homeowners move
and, therefore, repay their mortgages about every seven years.''
   Birk said two-step mortgages are aimed at military families,
people transferred regularly by corporations and first-time home
buyers who expect to buy a better home within seven years.
   ``Very clearly this is marketed at people who expect to move but
want to be protected in case they don't,'' Fannie Mae spokesman
Gene Eisman said.
   The loans likely will be particularly popular in California,
where people move frequently and home prices are among the highest
in the nation, Eisman said.
   Fannie Mae is a congressionally chartered, but shareholder
owned, company that helps finance about one of every eight home
mortgages in the nation. It buys mortgages from lenders. It
packages some into securities for resale to investors and buys and
holds others.

<HEAD>Things Looking Up for Hog Producers, USDA Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog producers are enjoying some relatively
good times and further improvement may be on the way, says an
Agriculture Department analysis.
   ``Returns have been on the upswing since last summer and could
rise further during the second quarter as hog prices approach their
seasonal peak,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
   Market prices of slaughter hogs ``may reach the middle to upper
$50s per hundredweight before the end of June, the highest in
nearly three years,'' the agency said in the March issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine. ``So far, prices in the first
quarter have mostly been in the high $40s.''
   On Monday, top barrows and gilts were quoted at $50.50 to $51
per 100 pounds, with some heavier weights ranging down to $46 and
$47.
   ``A relatively low rate of hog slaughter this spring is expected
to support prices,'' the report said. ``Based on the size of last
fall's pig crop, second-quarter slaughter could be down 7 percent
from a year earlier, the smallest for the spring quarter since
1987.''
   Most hogs grow to market weights in five to seven months, so
pigs farrowed in the fall usually make up most of the marketings in
the second quarter.
   ``The reduced supply of market hogs this spring could create
difficulties for the packing industry,'' the report said. ``Last
year, while hog producers were paring herds, pork packers were
expanding their slaughter capacity.''
   Consequently, the spread between hog prices and fresh pork
prices narrowed in 1989, and these packer margins will narrow
further through the first half of this year.
   Looking at cattle, the report said Choice-grade steers at Omaha
_ quoted at $76.50 to $77 on Monday _ ``may continue in the upper
$70s per hundredweight through late winter but drop to the
low-to-middle $70s in the spring'' as fed cattle marketings rise
from year-earlier levels.
   Analysts said Choice retail beef prices set a record all-cut
mark of $2.74 per pound in December, typically a month of low beef
demand.
   ``The retail price for Choice beef will continue strong through
the first quarter of 1990 despite beef price features in February,
the national meat month,'' the report said.
   Meanwhile, with outdoor cooking just around the corner, broiler
producers will probably boost production about 7 percent this year.
   As a result, wholesale and retail prices broiler prices ``will
likely decline considerably'' this year, the report said. On an
annual average, wholesale prices may be in the range of 49 to 55
cents per pound, compared with 59 cents in 1989.
   Wholesale turkey prices have dropped since December, and
producer returns ``are currently below break-even,'' the report
said. ``However, lower feed costs this year have compensated for
some of the price weakness.''

   Nine of the top 10 foreign markets for U.S.
agricultural products spent more last year than they did in 1988,
says the Agriculture Department. The exception was the European
Economic Community.
   Japan, the perennial leader, imported $8.15 billion worth of
U.S. products in the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30, up 12
percent from 1988.
   The EEC followed at $6.54 billion, down 13 percent from the
previous year, according to AgExporter magazine.
   ``New export records were set for seven of the top 10 export
markets for U.S. products _ Japan, Canada, Mexico, the Soviet
Union, Iraq, South Korea and Taiwan,'' the report said.
   Overall, 1988-89 exports were valued at $39.7 billion, up 12
percent from the previous year. A number of factors contributed to
the gain.
   ``Drought sharply reduced yields for most major bulk commodities
in the United States and Canada in 1988, which resulted in a
drawdown in stocks and higher prices,'' the report said.
   ``In addition, Asian economic affluence and growing demand for
Western-style foods has pushed this region to the top spot as a
market for U.S. agricultural exports,'' it added.
   Others in the top 10 included: Soviet Union, $3.19 billion, up
71 percent; Mexico, $2.77 billion, up 60 percent; South Korea,
$2.45 billion, up 9 percent; Canada, $2.19 billion, up 11 percent;
Taiwan, $1.59 billion, up 1 percent; China, $1.48 billion, up 142
percent; Egypt, $930 million, up 20 percent; and Iraq, $770
million, up 6 percent.

   The Agriculture Department has announced that
flue-cured tobacco farmers and buyers each will be assessed one
cent per pound for the 1990 crop.
   The total of two cents per pound will be assessed, down slightly
from last year's total of 2.24 cents. The No-Net-Cost Tobacco
Program Act of 1982 requires that the program operate at no net
costs to taxpayers.
   Officials said Monday they consulted with the Flue-cured Tobacco
Cooperative Stabilization Corp., the producer-owned association
that handles the support program, before determining the 1990
assessment.

<HEAD>House Chairman Rebuffs Pentagon Request to Shift Funds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon isn't getting much sympathy in
the House for its request to avert an expected massive layoff of
military personnel by taking $852 million from other accounts.
   The Defense Department made the request after deciding last year
not to ask President Bush to exclude personnel from Gramm-Rudman
budget cuts and after the administration chose not to seek an
exemption as it had done previously.
   But House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., with the
backing of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., declined to
bring the request up before his panel, dooming the Pentagon's
appeal.
   Such reprogramming of funds must be approved by the House and
Senate armed services committees and the House and Senate
appropriations panels.
   ``This is a disaster about to happen,'' Vice Adm. J.M. Boorda,
deputy chief of naval operations for manpower, personnel and
training, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
   Boorda predicted that without the ability to transfer funds, the
Navy will again be a hollow force. ``You'll have a Navy that looks
like 1979 and you'll have it by September,'' he said.
   Other personnel service chiefs said they will be forced to lay
off people, freeze promotions and take other drastic management
steps if Congress fails to give them the authority to move the
funds. The Defense Department has said it faces the dismissal of
tens of thousands of men and women by October.
   The Bush administration could have exempted the military
personnel accounts from the across-the-board cuts. Last week, Aspin
said, ``Putting weapons before people was their decision and now
they're stuck with it.''
   On Monday, Aspin indicated that he won't back down from his
decision.
   ``Reprogramming is going to be a useful exercise,'' Aspin told
Army officials who appeared before his Armed Services panel.
   Democrats on the House committee warned Army Chief of Staff Gen.
Carl Vuono and Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone that Congress is
looking at slashing $8 billion from Bush's $292 billion fiscal 1991
defense budget and they should draw up contingency plans for troop
reductions.
   Earlier Monday, the assistant secretary of defense for force
management and personnel told a Senate subcommittee that the
Pentagon did not recommend to the president that military personnel
be excluded from across-the-board cuts.
   Christopher Jehn said the Pentagon realized that excluding
military personnel would have left the armed services with ``a full
complement of people but not enough money to allow them to train
and to exercise at the levels we thought appropriate.''
   ``The tradeoff was whether we should protect personnel accounts
and wind up with what amounted to an imbalanced budget,'' Jehn told
the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on manpower and personnel.
   Questioned by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, the panel's chairman,
about the type of imbalances, Jehn said there would be ``extreme
shortages of things like spare parts, fuel to support flying hours
and steaming hours.''
   ``We made the sacrifice of people for spare parts,'' Glenn
interrupted.
   ``We did not make the sacrifice of people,'' Jehn answered.

   ``The Hunt for Red October'' surfaced with a
huge $17.2 million at the box office, making it the No. 1 film in
the nation.
   According to figures released Monday, the high-tech submarine
thriller starring Sean Connery and Alec Baldwin averaged $14,010
per screen over the weekend, an impressive take for a film playing
in more than 1,200 theaters.
   Paramount Pictures said the film had the biggest opening weekend
outside of the summer or Thanksgiving season.
   In the film based on Tom Clancy's best-selling novel, officers
of a Soviet nuclear missile-firing sub piloted by Connery plan to
defect. Baldwin plays a CIA agent who wants to bring the Soviet
captain in from the cold.
   Sme had feared that glasnost would torpedo the film, with its
Cold War theme.
   In second place was the Academy Award favorite ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' which netted $5.1 million, according to figures compiled
by Exhibitor Relations Co. Third with receipts of $4.2 million was
the Steven Seagal movie ``Hard to Kill.''

couple entertaining impossible house guests, landed in fourth with
ticket sales of $3.1 million. Fifth was director Oliver Stone's
``Born on the Fourth of July'' with $2.1 million.

   President Bush is convinced _ along with
national PTA President Ann Lynch and Chrysler Chairman Lee Iaccoca
_ that parents hold the key to greater student achievement.
   ``Education is a national mission that must include parents,''
Bush told about 250 Parent Teacher Association leaders who met at
the White House for a briefing Monday on the national education
goals.
   ``After all, a school program won't kiss away the pain from an
injured knee. A school program won't calm the fears of a child
about to get a first shot. And a school program alone cannot
instill a lifelong love of learning. But parents can spark the
flame of curiosity by reading to their children, every night,'' the
president said.
   Before the White House meeting, Lynch released a survey showing
that most parents are not getting involved in their children's
schools. ``Many parents are doing only half their job when it comes
to getting a good education for their children,'' she said.
   ``I'm convinced if we get more adults dropping into the schools,
the kids will stop dropping out,'' Iacocca said in a message
accompanying the survey.
   The survey found that fewer than half of the parents, about 44
percent, had visited their children's schools to participate in a
back-to-school night while 46 percent attended parent-organization
meetings during fall 1989.
   ``Too many (parents) sit at home and complain about the schools
without ever setting foot through the doors to find out how they
can help,'' said Ms. Lynch.
   The most common reasons for visiting schools included attending
a scheduled parent-teacher conference, which 71 percent had
attended, or class or school program, which 64 percent had attended.
   The survey, commissioned by Newsweek Inc. for the national PTA
and Chrysler's Dodge Division, was based on a national sample of
parents in 538 households with children enrolled in kindergarten
through 12th grade. Ninety percent of the children were in public
school with 10 percent in either private or parochial schools.
   Dr. Ernest Boyer, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, suggested that parents be given at least a
day or two off from work, with pay, to consult with teachers and
spend time with their child at school.
   ``If society sees value in giving employees release time for
jury duty and to vote, surely allowing parents time to be engaged
in the education of their children is in the public interest,''
said Boyer.
   While the survey showed that parents' school involvement often
was low, most parents said they were very active in their
children's education at home. Two of every three, 69 percent, said
they discussed school topics with their children nearly every
school day. More than half, 58 percent, helped with homework at
least two to three times a week, and 52 percent read to or with
their children at least once a week.
   More than half, 57 percent, said their own role was ``extremely
influential'' in their children's learning. However, 53 percent of
the parents surveyed were not involved in any kind of parent group.
Many of those parents cited lack of time or work commitments.
   Among parents who are involved in parent groups, a large
majority are more likely to help with fund raising, 80 percent, and
extracurricular events, 72 percent, than to volunteer in
classrooms, 52 percent, or participate in curriculum or policy
making, 33 percent.
   The survey was conducted by ICR Survey Research Group in Media,
Pa. between Dec. 29 and Jan. 7. The margin of error is plus or
minus 4.5 percentage points.

   Donny Osmond flashed his perfect teeth,
autographed pictures and even sang a little for an Arizona Senate
committee. But the lawmakers weren't singing his song when they
voted to require warning labels on risque records.
   The Judiciary Committee approved the measure 8-1 Monday.
   The recording industry opposes the bill, and Osmond, who
acknowledged his ``goody-goody'' image, was the industry's star
witness.
   Osmond, wearing a black leather jacket and cowboy boots, said he
always had strict morals but had written lyrics that probably would
qualify for the warning labels, especially if sung with a different
intonation.
   The committee's audience included teen-agers with T-shirts
promoting controversial groups, and many groaned at first when the
pop singer got up to testify.
   But they laughed when he said, ``I'm a little out of my
element.'' And they applauded when he finished testifying for their
side after breaking into song.
   The bill's supporters countered with Steve Clifford, an
insurance executive who said he had founded the heavy metal group
Icon.
   Heavy metal ``is a destructive lifestyle,'' Clifford said,
testifying in businessman's suit and neat haircut. ``It got me into
drug abuse, alcoholism. I thought about suicide. I tampered with
Satanism.''

   A scriptwriter became the second man in a
week to file a lawsuit accusing actor Eddie Murphy and Paramount
Pictures of stealing the screenplay for ``Harlem Nights.''
   Hafiz Farid of Newark, in a lawsuit filed in federal court
Monday, claimed he sent copies of a screenplay titled ``Going
Straight'' to Murphy, Paramount and actor Richard Pryor as early as
1989.
   Farid said many of his ideas were used in the 1989 ``Harlem
Nights,'' starring Murphy and Pryor, but he received no credit or
payment.
   Paramount spokeswoman Deborah Rosen rejected the claim.
   ``We have never heard of Mr. Farid,'' she said. ``We know of no
similarity to anything Mr. Farid may have written.''
   Last week, Michael Greene of Hempstead, N.Y., claimed his
screenplay, ``A Halloween to Remember,'' was the real source of the
movie. Greene said he submitted his script to Murphy last year but
was told it had been rejected.

   A woman who said she was romantically linked
with Ben Vereen asked for a restraining order against the
song-and-dance man after he allegedly broke into her apartment and
assaulted her.
   Christine Rich filed a petition in Superior Court on Friday,
alleging that Vereen, shouting profanities, kicked in her apartment
door Thursday, grabbed her arm, neck and clothing and threw her to
the ground.
   Ms. Rich said she dialed 911 and police arrived. Police Sgt.
Roger Belding confirmed Monday that Vereen was arrested for
investigation of a misdemeanor assault and released on his own
recognizance after about two hours.
   A hearing on the restraining order was set for March 19.
   Michelle Marx, a spokeswoman for Vereen, said the entertainer
had no comment about the allegations.
   Vereen battled alcohol and drug problems after the death of a
16-year-old daughter in 1987 and has become an anti-drug activist.

   Bob Hope, unable to attend a charity
event, bought five raffle tickets at $1,000 apiece to help out _
and one of them won him the grand prize, including a $50,000 car.
   When host Jimmy Stewart picked Hope's name Sunday, he said,
``You're not going to believe this. It's Bob Hope.''
   The prize was a luxury BMW, a set of luggage and a trip to
Germany.
   ``Isn't that amazing? I never win a thing,'' Hope said from his
desert home Monday.
   Hope was performing Friday night in Texas and couldn't appear at
the Beverly Hilton Hotel's ``An Evening of Elegance.'' He bought
five of the 100 tickets sold for the benefit for abused and
neglected children.
   It would seem the globe-trotting entertainer wouldn't need
luggage or a free trip to Munich. He's made dozens of overseas
trips to entertain U.S. troops over Christmas, including visits to
Germany.
   ``You think you're kidding, don't you? I can use the luggage,''
Hope said. But he said he didn't know what he would do with the car.

   Authors Studs Terkel and Kurt Vonnegut were
among about 350 authors, editors, literary agents and sympathizers
who staged a noisy protest accusing Random House of wrecking a key
subsidiary for financial reasons.
   The protesters Monday charged that Random House owner Samuel I.
Newhouse had effectively killed the subsidiary, Pantheon Books, by
forcing the resignation Wednesday of its longtime editorial
director, Andre Schiffrin.
   Terkel, clutching a plastic coffee cup in near-freezing weather,
was among a number of Pantheon-published writers who turned out for
the demonstration.
   Vonnegut, although not a Pantheon client, said he was
``disturbed that a great American institution like this should be
destroyed.''
   Random House chairman Alberto Vitale said he was ``absolutely
puzzled'' by the reaction to Schiffrin's resignation.
   ``It's not Random House who is hurting anything,'' Vitale said
in a telephone interview. ``Random House has kept Pantheon going
all these years.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Bank, biggest source of loans to the
Third World, said today it is planning to double its lending on
education to $1.5 billion a year.
   Bank President Barber B. Conable announced the plan in a speech
prepared for a week-long world conference on education being held
at Jomtien, a seaside resort in Thailand. Copies of the speech were
made available by World Bank headquarters in Washington.
   Conable estimated that 100 million Third World children are not
enrolled in school.
   ``Education... is an indispensable segment of the bridge over
which the poor can cross the gulf from misery to hope,'' he said.
``It is crucial to the empowerment of people.''
   The World Bank, owned by 152 countries, lends more than $21
billion a year. Conable said that since 1963 it has lent about $10
billion for education, more than $2 billion of it for basic
education, in 100 countries.
   Conable said that less than 50 cents of every $100 of
international aid now goes to primary education.
   ``Clearly, the donor community cannot expect to be an effective
partner in the efforts which flow from this conference unless there
is a dramatic change in aid flows to basic education,'' he said.

   George Washington could not tell a lie, but
he apparently could leave behind a whopping debt.
   An ancestor of Jacob DeHaven, who lent Washington $450,000 worth
of gold and supplies in 1777, is looking for repayment of the loan.
   With interest, the bill comes to $105.3 billion.
   ``If I owed the government this money, I would be expected to
pay the principal, interest and any penalties that might have been
incurred,'' said Carolyn Cokerham of San Antonio.
   Ms. Cokerham is one of nearly 2,000 living descendants of
DeHaven, who made the loan to Washington to help defeat the British
in the Revolutionary War.
   After the war, the government offered to repay DeHaven's loan in
continentals, the then-worthless currency of the fledging country.
But DeHaven refused and later died penniless.
   Ms. Cokerham and his other descendants have tried unsuccessfully
to get the money repaid throughout the years.
   Jo Beth Kloecker, an attorney handling the case, said the U.S.
Claims Court in Washington last month dismissed the lawsuit because
the debt is more than 6 years old. She appealed to the U.S. Court
of Appeals.
   Ms. Cokerham claims her grandmother once had a contract signed
by Washington promising repayment and 6 percent interest compounded
annually. She said she'd like to receive some money, but she really
wants her day in court.
   ``I want the government to admit that this was a debt of honor
made by a patriotic man,'' she said. ``I hope it will be addressed
in my lifetime, but it has been 213 years.''

   News flash: Walt Disney doesn't
operate in Florida.
   That's what Walt Disney Co. lawyers say in response to a lawsuit
by Mary Costa, the voice of Sleeping Beauty. She wants a cut of the
$29 million she says the entertainment giant has earned on the 1986
videotape version of the tale.
   ``The Walt Disney Co. is not qualified to do business in Florida
and does not do business in Florida,'' said Disney Vice President
Doris Smith said in papers filed in state court.
   But what about Walt Disney World near Orlando, which has been in
operation since 1971 and draws millions of visitors every year?
   ``Of course (Walt Disney Co.) owns subsidiaries that are present
and do business in Florida,'' Disney lawyer Luis Bustamante said in
court papers. But he said, ``To uphold this (state court) order
would be to declare that (Walt Disney Co.) can be sued in any state
where people can buy Disney videocassettes or Mickey Mouse
sweatshirts.'' The company wants the case heard in California.
   The argument didn't sway the Palm Beach County Circuit Court,
which ruled in favor of Ms. Costa, a Palm Beach opera singer.
   But Disney isn't giving up: It will try to persuade an appeals
court in West Palm Beach that Walt Disney doesn't operate in
Florida.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
attend independence ceremonies this month in Namibia on an African
trip that could thrust him into negotiations to dismantle racial
segregation in South Africa.
   So far, the State Department is giving few details on what could
turn out to be a nine-day trip to a half-dozen countries.
Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler announced on Monday only his stop
in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.
   But preparations were under way for possible visits to Senegal,
Zaire, Botswana, Zambia, Ivory Coast and South Africa, where the
white minority government last month ended a 30-year ban on the
African National Congress and released black leader Nelson Mandela
from prison.
   Baker is going to Windhoek to join with other world leaders as
the former South African colony gains independence and Sam Nujoma,
a former guerrilla leader who spent 30 years in exile, is sworn in
as president.
   Nujoma helped found the South-West Africa People's Organization
in 1960 and led it through a 23-year bush war against South African
rule of Africa's last colony.
   While representing President Bush at the ceremonies, Baker will
have a chance to meet with South African President F.W. de Klerk
and Mandela, but he is unlikely to turn the occasion into a
substantive session about dismantling apartheid in South Africa,
said a U.S. official, who spoke on condition on anonymity.
   Rather, the official told The Associated Press, it is ``highly
likely'' that Baker would have those discussions in Cape Town and
Johannesburg, South Africa, where he would meet with a wide range
of government and opposition leaders.
   The Bush administration has praised de Klerk for the steps he
has taken toward racial reconciliation, while urging him to move
faster. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions designed to punish South Africa
for apartheid remain in place.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler said the Windhoek stop was the only one
scheduled so far. She said she did know when Baker would leave
Washington or return home.
   ``We don't know anything other than the announcement I just
made,'' she said. ``It could be the only stop he makes, it could be
that other steps are added.''

   The Senate debate over cleaning up the
nation's air is moving from behind closed doors to the Senate floor
with consideration of compromise legislation that is endorsed by
the White House.
   As the bill, representing the first tightening of federal
air-pollution laws in 13 years, came up for discussions late
Monday, it promptly came under attack as being too expensive and
burdensome to industry.
   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
does not intend to see the legislation languish. He called it the
best package that could be fashioned in nearly three weeks of
closed-door talks with the Bush administration.
   ``We're going to stay with this bill until we complete it,
sooner or later,'' said Mitchell. He said Congress has grappled
with clean air legislation for a decade and ``rarely has there been
legislation so thoroughly considered, so long debated, so much
discussed.''
   The way for floor action was cleared last week when Senate
leaders and the White House agreed on curbs on toxic industrial
chemicals released into the air, smog-causing pollutants from
automobiles and the compounds that cause acid rain.
   It's uncertain how long the debate over the compromise
legislation might last. Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader,
last week urged Mitchell to allow ample time for discussions and
amendments that might be brought up.
   After brief opening remarks by Mitchell and several senators
Monday, the discussions were recessed and were not expected to
resume until later today.
   But even before the revised legislation was brought to the
floor, the compromise came under attack from both critics who said
it was too tough on industry and senators who called it too weak to
clean the dirty skies over the nation's cities.
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, who was the only member of the
Environment and Public Works Committee to vote against an earlier
version of the legislation last November, said the compromise
represented little improvement over the committee bill.
   It's the ``big long arm of the federal government intruding into
the lives of the American people,'' said Symms. ``I'm not sure we
need this bill right now.''
   Mitchell snapped back that Symms ``has opposed every effort to
improve the quality of America's air in the past 10 years.''
   At a news conference, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the
legislation fails to require the auto emission controls needed to
clean the air in seriously polluted areas such as the major
metropolitan areas of the Northeast.
   ``Americans are choking on dirty air, and the clean air bill
coming to the Senate floor just won't get the job done,'' said
Lautenberg. He promised to seek some changes to the bill in the
coming days.
   But the two floor managers of the bill _ Sens. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., and John Chafee, R-R.I., _ said the bill represented a
significant step forward in achieving cleaner air, including new
controls on sulfur dioxide emissions from power plant and other
boilers, a major precursor of acid rain.
   Among other provisions, the bill calls for annual sulfur dioxide
emissions to be cut by 10 million tons or a bit less than half by
the year 2000; tougher auto tailpipe controls and new curbs on
industrial pollution to reduce urban smog in urban areas; and a
requirement that industry use the best available technology to
reduce toxic chemical releases.
   While the legislation moves to floor debate in the Senate, a
similar clean air bill remains in a House committee.

problem. The Los Angeles area is allowed 20 years.
   _Areas must show annual progress, ozone reductions of 4 percent
a year for the first six years and 3 percent annually thereafter. A
waiver may be granted if the costs of the annual reductions exceed
$5,000 per ton of ozone-forming pollutants.
   Reductions are to be attained through cuts in automobile
emissions and smog-causing releases from industrial plants. Small
business emitting less than 100 tons are exempt.

   _Automakers must reduce tailpipe emissions of smog-causing
pollutants with all cars covered by new emission controls by 1995.
Hydrocarbons _ unburned fuel _ would have to be cut by 22 percent
to 0.25 grams per mile and nitrogen oxides by 60 percent to 0.4
grams.
   A second round of tailpipe controls would go into effect in 2003
cutting emissions another 50 percent if 11 cities now with
``serious'' pollution problems fail to meet air quality standards.
Cities with even more serious problems would have to use
cleaner-burning fuels such as methanol or specially formulated
gasoline.

using clean coal technology may delay initial compliance until 1997.
   Dirty plants, primarily in the Midwest, also received extra
pollution control allowances, which may be sold to recoup some of
control costs. Western states also receive additional bonus
allowances to provide cushion for growth.

   College students prefer periodic tests
or term papers to big final exams and learn more from teachers who
give them substantial, immediate feedback, a Harvard University
study found.
   For example, a ``one-minute, low-tech, no-cost'' technique is to
ask students at the end of each class for a quick, one-paragraph
summary of what they learned, said Richard J. Light, author of the
three-year study issued Monday.
   The study concludes that modest shifts in academic policies can
create major improvements in college classrooms.
   Light, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and
Kennedy School of Government, based the study on in-depth
interviews with 360 Harvard undergraduates _ conducted by their
fellow students _ and seminars that included faculty and
administrators from Harvard and about 20 other institutions.
   Among the conclusions of ``Explorations with Students and
Faculty about Teaching, Learning and Student Life'':
   _Students said they learned the most in classes with periodic
tests, oral presentations and papers that let them know how they
were doing ``mid-course,'' rather than a big exam at the end of the
course.
   In particular, students indicated they preferred opportunities
to rewrite term papers after ``red-penciling'' by faculty.
``Students said they learned more from doing the fourth draft than
by doing the first draft,'' Light said.
   _Students found small study groups of up to six people meeting
outside the classroom particularly effective. Light said teachers
should encourage formation of such groups.
   _Students in outside activities such as athletics or clubs, jobs
or volunteer work for up to 35 hours a week ``are by far the
happiest students,'' Light said. He said teachers should urge
students to ``get involved.''
   While only Harvard students were involved in the study, Light
said the in-depth questionnaires and the information from the
seminars made the results applicable to other institutions,
including high school and graduate school.
   Light said he was surprised by some of the differences found
between male and female students.
   For example, although there is no substantial difference between
the grades of male and female students, 39 percent of the females
said they were not happy with their academic performance, compared
with 19 percent of men, he said.
   Also, although both groups indicated that study groups were
effective, males were more likely to join one or form one, Light
said.
   Twelve undergraduate and graduate students were trained by Light
and other colleagues before they conducted interviews with the 360
randomly selected Harvard students. They used a 23-page
questionnaire that included many open-ended questions. Follow-up
interviews were done five to six months later.
   R. Eugene Rice, senior fellow at the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, said the Harvard study ``confirms a lot
that we know about learning, in fact, just about human work in
general _ the importance of feedback, its regulation and its
timing.''
   Rice said he hoped that faculty heeds the study's
recommendations, but he noted that universities must then ``reward
faculty for putting their time into this kind of teaching which
take away time for work on research.''

<HEAD>Chamorro Representatives Seek US Aid for Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nicaragua is shopping for international aid
for its incoming democratic government, and U.S. officials say
they'll have a proposal ready to send President Bush within two
weeks.
   Representatives of President-elect Violeta Chamorro, declaring
their intention to seek aid from Japan and Western Europe, said
Monday the Soviet Union has agreed to continue the economic
assistance it gave to the Sandinista regime of President Daniel
Ortega.
   Pedro Chamorro, son of the newly elected Nicaraguan leader, told
reporters at the State Department: ``The Soviets assure us that
they are going to help Nicaragua; they are going to honor their
commitments.''
   Commenting after a meeting with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and other ranking officials, Chamorro said that while
Soviet arms are no longer needed or wanted, continued imports of
Soviet oil are vital to Nicaragua's recovery.
   Chamorro and other political and economic advisers to Mrs.
Chamorro plan further talks with government officials and with
representatives of international lending institutions.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, said a package of recommendations will be sent to Bush
within the next two weeks, spelling out what the United States can
do to help.
   The U.S. economic embargo imposed against the Sandinista regime
likely will be lifted before Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration as
president on April 25, Aronson said.
   A senior State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that to clear the way for U.S. aid to Nicaragua,
Congress must agree to waive a law barring new assistance to a
nation already in debt to the United States.
   He said there will be concerns about setting a precedent but
added: ``I think there is a general recognition in both houses of
Congress and in both parties that Nicaragua needs some immediate
help.''
   Chamorro and two other advisers to the new government _ Alfredo
Cesar and Francisco Mayorga _ said no requests were made for a
specific level of U.S. aid. Dollar figures will be discussed later,
they said.
   Chamorro and Mayargo said the situation is complicated by the
fact that the Sandinista government held economic data as a state
secret. As a result, the full dimensions of Nicaragua's needs may
not be known for some time, they said.
   Mayorga said, however, that ``hundreds of millions of dollars''
will be sought from all sources, including the United States.
   ``We expect the entire international community to contribute,''
he said.
   The Bush administration made clear that it also expects
substantial help for Nicaragua from the international community,
including Japan and Europe.
   ``The aid question is being worked on currently,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``We have optimism that the
European allies, as well as the Soviet Union and Japan, are willing
to help.''
   Mrs. Chamorro's government _ which defeated Ortega and his
leftists at the polls on Feb. 25 _ will replace the Sandinistas,
whose overthrow the United States was unable to accomplish with
military support for Contra rebels.
   Although the administration has pledged meaningful U.S. aid
levels for Nicaragua, the final scope of the assistance package
likely will be dictated by budget constraints and the needs of
other fledgling democracies emerging in Eastern Europe.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chairman of the House Appropriations
subcommittee that handles foreign aid, told reporters: ``There is a
long line forming outside the door on that score. ... We need to be
cautious about the kind of direct financial investments we are
going to be asked to make at a time when we have limited
resources.''

   A woman was charged in the death of her
5-year-old son, who allegedly was given 10 ounces of bourbon and
told to ``drink it like a man'' by a friend of his mother's.
   Patricia Griffin, 31, was jailed on $10,000 bail on charges of
causing injury to a child by gross negligence in the death
Wednesday of Raymond Thomas Griffin II. Anthony Jimerson, 21, was
previously jailed on $100,000 bail on a charge of injury to a child.
   Witnesses have told police that Jimerson wanted the boy to go to
sleep at a neighborhood gathering March 2 so he could be alone with
Mrs. Griffin, said Police Chief Roger Larm.
   Larm said Monday that Ms. Griffin was negligent because the boy
did not receive immediate medical attention. The offense carries 10
years in prison and a fine of up to $10,000.
   ``An ambulance wasn't called until 16 hours after the original
consumption of alcohol, and 12 hours after he started being
seriously ill,'' Larm said.
   Doctors said the boy suffered irreversible brain damage after
drinking the bourbon and some beer and had a blood alcohol level of
.55 percent, five times the legal definition of intoxication in
Texas. He died at a hospital.
   A hearing was scheduled today to decide whether to keep the
boy's 2-year-old brother in a foster home.

<HEAD>US Officials Warn of US Retaliation Against Japanese Trade Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is pressuring Japan to
buy more American products or face the threat that ``festering
frictions'' over Japan's huge trade surplus could result in U.S.
retaliatory actions.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said Monday the Japanese
``risk having our market closed or at least gravely limited'' if
they fail to dismantle their barriers to U.S. goods.
   She said President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki
Kaifu agreed during a weekend summit that there was considerable
urgency in reducing America's $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   But at a congressional hearing Monday, two key senators
expressed disappointment that the summit produced no trade
breakthroughs. Administration witnesses were questioned closely on
why there has been no progress despite six months of talks aimed at
removing Japanese trade barriers.
   ``Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States is rising fast,''
said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. ``Japan has a choice. It can either
follow the lead of the rest of the world and open its markets or it
can keep its markets closed and have the rest of the world follow
its lead.''
   In a pointed reference to the expanded retaliatory tools
Congress gave the administration two years ago, Sen. John Danforth,
R-Mo., said, ``If we didn't go far enough in 1988, believe me, we
can go further.''
   Hills, answering questions following a speech, said there would
be ``tremendous political pressure'' in the United States to
retaliate if the Kaifu government does not move promptly to attack
the trade imbalance.
   ``There's no question that Japan has gained its economic
well-being from worldwide trade and worldwide investment,'' she
said. ``If it fails to open its markets to the same extent to our
entrepreneurs, they risk having our market closed or at least
gravely limited and therein risk killing the goose that laid their
golden egg as well as ours.''
   In Tokyo, Kaifu defended his summit meeting with Bush against
critics who demanded to know what types of commitments Kaifu had
made in response to U.S. pressure.
   ``The United States is willing to have a dialogue with us. Do
you really believe dialogue is bad?'' Kaifu asked during
parliamentary debate.
   The dispute between the two nations involves so-called
structural impediment talks aimed at attacking economic
shortcomings in both nations that have been blamed for the trade
imbalance.
   American negotiators have demanded that the Japanese reform
their distribution system to allow the sale of more imported goods
and tighten enforcement of anti-monopoly laws to prevent Japanese
companies from freezing out foreign firms.
   Following the two-day summit, Bush said the United States would
do its part by reducing the federal budget deficit, improving
education and worker training and increasing savings and investment.
   At Monday's hearing by the Senate Finance subcommittee on trade,
Undersecretary of State Richard McCormack said U.S. negotiators
will be looking for significant progress at the fourth round of
negotiations, scheduled for April 2-3 in Washington.
   But administration officials conceded they have no assurance of
any breakthrough either in April or before a final report is due in
July.
   ``The basic question is whether the Japanese side sees this as a
damage control exercise _ public relations _ or whether they see it
as one requiring substantive effort,'' said Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative S. Linn Williams. ``On that point the jury is still
out.''
   J. Michael Farren, the Commerce Department's undersecretary for
trade, said the U.S. trade deficit, which totaled $108.6 billion
last year, has improved with Japan by only 15 percent since 1987.
During the same period, the U.S. deficit with Germany was cut in
half and it was reduced by 29 percent with Korea, Taiwan and other
East Asian countries.
   ``There is an all-but-explicit underlying assumption that the
Japanese surplus must be maintained ... as a hedge against
anticipated oil price increases,'' Farren said. ``American workers
will continue paying the insurance premium with the price being
American jobs and a diminishing U.S. standard of living.''

<TEXT>
   A former gynecologist accused of performing
genital surgery on women without their knowledge to enhance their
sexual responsiveness is suing CBS for $250 million over a ``West
57th Street'' broadcast.
   CBS said it stands by the story on James C. Burt, who alleged in
the lawsuit filed Monday in federal court that he was defamed by
the program.
   Burt, 68, faces about 50 malpractice suits for his
self-described ``love surgery,'' in which he altered the genitals
of his patients, allegedly without their consent. He said the
surgery was designed to enhance their responsiveness.
   Burt sued over a 1988 broadcast of the news show that contained
interviews with several former patients. The program is no longer
on the air.
   The show's ``ludicrous and horrendous programming of the segment
concerning `The Love Doctor and his Love Surgery' started a chain
reaction of talk shows, magazine articles, media reports that have
since totally destroyed my personal life, my profession as
physician, loss of property, loss of income, my family,'' Burt said
in a statement.
   Also named as defendants were two past or present CBS employees,
a patient and another doctor.
   ``We believe the report was entirely fair and accurate, and CBS
News stands by it,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.
   In 1989, Burt surrendered his medical license just days before a
disciplinary hearing.
   The board had charged that the surgery caused sexual
dysfunction, emotional distress, infection, chronic pain and the
need for corrective surgery in some patients.
   ``This has been the biggest hoax that TV has ever seen,'' Burt
said. ``I have never operated on anybody without informed consent.''

<HEAD>Ethiopia's Leader Wants Capitalism, Says Marxism Failed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam has
declared a failure the Marxist economic system he and fellow army
officers imposed after overthrowing the late Emperor Haile Selassie
in 1974.
   In a speech Monday to the Central Committee of the ruling
Marxist Workers' Party, Mengistu said he wants a return to
capitalism.
   The embattled president is fighting two bitter guerrilla wars
simultaneously and facing cuts in aid from his principal
benefactor, the Soviet Union. He appears to be wooing foreign
investment.
   The Central Committee must approve Mengistu's recommendations,
but there appeared to be little chance that it would not go along
with his plans for a drastic overhaul of the country's shattered
economy.
   In recent months, Mengistu has taken many small, seemingly
half-hearted steps to attract foreign investment and encourage
domestic production, but his speech Monday appeared a near total
capitulation to capitalism.
   He conceded that economic central planning had been a failure.
   Among the specific reforms Mengistu mentioned were:
   _ Allowing the private sector to take part in all sectors of the
economy with no limit on capital investment. Ethiopia has had a
$250,000 ceiling on all types of private investment.
   _ Giving government-owned land on a concessional basis to
private commercial firms for construction of industries, hotels and
a wide range of other enterprises.
   _ Allowing developers to build houses, apartments and office
buildings for rent or sale. At present, all land and commercial
deeds are held by the government.
   _ Putting the government's myriad of state-owned industries and
businesses on a profit basis, with those continuing to lose money
to be sold or closed.
   _ Giving peasant farmers legal ownership of the land they till
and the right to sell their produce to private wholesale and retail
outlets. Ownership of the land has been held by the state, with
purchase of crops handled by government marketing boards.
   Mengistu also told the Central Committee that Ethiopia's
strategic Red Sea port of Massawa has been ``paralyzed'' by renewed
fighting between the government and the secessionist Eritrean
People's Liberation Front.
   He did not, however, acknowledge a rebel claim that the port had
been captured.
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting the government for 28
years for independence for Ethiopia's northernmost province, a
former Italian colony. They launched a new offensive in February
after an almost year-long, de facto cease-fire.
   Mengistu did say another major rebel group, the Tigre People's
Liberation Front, had recaptured the vital garrison town of Debre
Tabor, cutting off government access to much of Gondor Province.
   The town fell to the Tigrean rebels shortly after they also
ended a long cease-fire with an offensive in August. The government
managed to take it back in January, but the rebels claimed to have
captured it once again last month.
   The Tigrean rebels seek the overthrow of Mengistu and the
replacement of his government with one patterned after that of
Albania, the last hard-line Stalinist regime in Eastern Europe.
   In recent years, Ethiopia has been the Soviet Union's staunchest
ally in Africa. The Soviets, however, have been pressing Mengistu
to negotiate with rebels and end the costly war in an effort to cut
Soviet aid to Ethiopia. Moscow sent $600 million in arms to
Ethiopia last year.

   Ann Richards just won't say no _ or yes _
to whether she's ever misused drugs, jeopardizing her run for
governor.
   With the Democratic primary election a week away, the state
treasurer Monday blasted her opponents _ former Gov. Mark White and
Attorney General Jim Mattox _ saying they have ducked questions
about their personal finances.
   But Ms. Richards wouldn't say whether she's ever used an illegal
drug, a question raised at two debates, the first of them two weeks
ago. The question has dogged her ever since.
   At a news conference, Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, said
she never knowingly committed a felony and repeated a statement she
has made before: ``I haven't had a mood-altering chemical for 10
years.''
   On the Republican side, three contenders are trying to keep
multimillionaire oilman Clayton Williams from winning the
nomination outright without a runoff.
   After pumping more than $4 million of his own into a slick TV
campaign, the colorful Williams stood at 45 percent in a Dallas
Morning News-Houston Chronicle poll published Feb. 25. If he wins
50 percent in the March 13 balloting, he avoids a runoff election
for the GOP nomination to succeed retiring Republican Gov. Bill
Clements.
   Among the Democrats, Ms. Richards had been front-runner since
entering the race in June, until White pulled ahead in the Feb. 25
poll, which showed him with 34 percent to Ms. Richards' 31 percent.
Mattox was third at 17 percent.
   Richards, who captured national attention at the Democratic
National Convention two years ago by describing George Bush as
having been born with ``a silver foot in his mouth,'' hasn't
displayed a silver tongue on the drug issue, observers have said.
   Her tack Monday was to attack her opponents.
   ``I have been sober for 10 years,'' Ms. Richards said. ``Have
Jim Mattox and Mark White been honest for 10 years?''
   White and Mattox have said they never used illegal drugs, and
both on Monday denied any financial improprieties. They said her
charges reflect Ms. Richards' fall in recent opinion polls after
being the front-runner for months.
   ``I feel sorry for Ann. Sorry that she is so desperate that she
feels she has to lash out this way with such ridiculous and
outrageous charges,'' White said.
   ``She's desperate. Her campaign's in a tailspin,'' said Kelly
Fero, press secretary for Mattox's campaign.
   On the drug issue, Ms. Richards said, ``I feel very sincerely
that the continuing dialogue is very destructive. It is destructive
for me. It is destructive for other people out there who might seek
treatment. The important thing in this time is to put principle
above politics.''
   Ms. Richards, who has made public income tax returns for all
years she has been treasurer, criticized White for releasing only
his 1988 return and Mattox for keeping all of his confidential.

   Cheating appears to be on the rise among
college students, according to researchers who say the trend may be
a sign of today's ``make it'' mentality.
   Studies indicate about 20 percent to 30 percent of students
cheat. Some copy from classmates' work, others plagiarize term
papers or use crib sheets during exams, while others take advantage
of computer technology.
   ``One student who was caught couldn't understand what he'd done
that was so wrong,'' said Arthur Levine, chairman of Harvard
University's Institute for Educational Management.
   ``His argument amounted to: `Everyone cheats and as long as I do
it well, I won't get caught and will succeed in society.'''
   Forty-three percent of 5,000 professors nationwide responded
``yes'' when the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching asked: ``Are today's undergraduates more willing to cheat
in order to get good grades?''
   ``Perhaps the most discouraging side of the survey data is the
portrait faculty paint of students, both in the classroom and
beyond,'' the Princeton-based foundation's president, Ernest L.
Boyer, wrote on releasing the study in November.
   Getting ahead any way you know how is sometimes perceived as
part of playing the game of survival, college administrators said
Monday.
   ``Students read the newspaper and look at television and see
plenty of examples of dishonesty in society,'' said Timothy F.
Brooks, dean of students at the University of Delaware in Newark,
Del.
   ``It's a massive problem and a disturbing reflection of our
society.''

   Carlos Kleiber conducted Verdi's ``Otello'' at
the Metropolitan Opera for the first time. The audience heard
something much different from the usual ``Otello.''
   The emphasis Monday was on the entire evening as one piece of
music, telling a story.
   Met audiences probably have never heard so much soft singing in
``Otello.'' Arias weren't done as set pieces that stopped at the
end for applause. Understatement ruled, and when a loud outburst
came, it was very dramatic.
   Placido Domingo sang Otello, Katia Ricciarelli was Desdemona and
Justino Diaz was Iago. Miss Ricciarelli, who hasn't been at the Met
since 1982, probably came off best singing softly. She floated some
lovely pianissimos. Her voice sounds right for the part, secure but
sweet.
   Domingo was splendid, continuing to display more dept in his
characterization and in his dramatic tenor the more he sings Otello.
   Diaz has a wonderful tone and, as a bass instead of a baritone
Iago, can insinuate even more of that low, evil sound as Iago
infects Otello with jealousy. With a boyish haircut and singing
softly much of the time, Diaz took more a snake-in-the-grass
approach than rough or devilish one.
   This production, new in 1972, has always had Iago carrying books
hither and yon while singing his ``Credo.'' That's one aria we'd
like to have the singer stand and deliver.
   On Monday, there were several solos instead of all choral
singing when people bring flowers to Desdemona in Act 2.
   And there have been changes in staging. Instead of climbing the
stairs to their castle while singing love music, with bright stars
behind them, at the end of Act 1, Otello and Desdemona nestle down,
singing, on the Cyprus dock, with only a few subdued stars.
   This is a subtle and subdued reading of ``Otello,'' with dynamic
range and great musical beauty.

<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. is recalling 24,000 packages
of its Microwave Chunky Beef Soup because it could contain harmful
organisms.
   The soup was made in the company's Maxton, N.C., facility and
distributed to retail stores in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Some of the 24,000
packages also were distributed to the military.
   The soup was packaged in paper cartons, each containing one
9{-ounce microwavable plastic bowl with a ``metallized sealed
lid,'' an Agriculture Department announcement said Monday. The
suspected product is identified by a three-line code stamped on the
side panel of the package.
   Only packages with the code ``Dec90, Est4R, CO9J'' are being
recalled.
   The problem was reported to USDA after company officials
discovered that one day's production was not sterile and ``could
allow the growth of organisms that cause illness, if those
organisms were present,'' the agency said.
   Consumers with questions about the recall may call the toll-free
USDA hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Monday
through Friday. In the Washington metropolitan area, the number if
447-3333.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Hutton Ordered to Pay More Than $1 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitration panel has ordered Shearson
Lehman Hutton to pay damages totaling more than $1 million to three
Oklahomans who claimed their broker made unauthorized trades and
churned their accounts.
   An arbitration panel of the National Association of Securities
Dealers ordered Shearson to pay $994,766 in compensatory and
punitive damages and lawyers' fees to Temple, Okla. farmer Walter
Earl Cox and his wife, Ardenia F. Cox.
   In a decision late last month, disclosed Monday, the panel also
awarded separately a total of $60,694 in damages and fees to Mrs.
Cox and her mother, Cuba E. Read, of Comanche, Okla.
   The treble compensatory damages stemmed from claims made by the
Coxes under the civil provisions of the federal racketeering laws.
   Both awards came in response to claims made against one-time
Shearson registered representative Lindy Kent Ridinger of Wichita
Falls, Texas.
   The Coxes' lawyer, Frank Lewis, of Phoenix, Ariz., said the
decision was the first he knew of where both punitive and treble
damages were awarded as well as attorney's fees.
   Shearson denied the accusations and Ridinger, who was fired June
2, 1986, never responded to the charges, according to documents of
the NASD.
   Ridinger was formally censured by the NASD, barred from
associating with its members ``in any capacity'' and fined $50,000.
He was not reachable for comment.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar ended lower against the Japanese yen
today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell back after
early gains.
   The dollar closed at 149.50 yen, down 0.45 yen from Monday's
149.95-yen finish. It opened at 148.97 yen and ranged between
148.50 yen and 149.55 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 33,791.08, down
54.12 points, or 0.16 percent. It had lost 212.36 points Monday.
   Dealers said the index started falling in the afternoon session
as market players sold electrical issues following a rumor that the
business performance of some electrical companies, including Fanuc
Ltd. and Amada Co., had deteriorated. The rumors turned out to be
false, said Kazuyuki Suzuki of Daiwa Securities.
   Government bond prices edged up as market players were reassured
by the yen's recovery against the dollar. The price of the
benchmark No. 119 10-year government bond rose to 87.08 in late
afternoon, up 0.08 from Monday's close of 87.00. Its yield fell to
7.105 percent, down 0.025 from Monday's 7.13 percent.
   The dollar's lower opening in Tokyo followed its fall against
almost all major currencies overnight as central banks engaged in
coordinated dollar-selling.
   The central banks of Japan, the United States, Britain, France
and West Germany bought their own currencies in an effort to push
the dollar down, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with
New Japan Securities Co.
   But the dollar strengthened slightly after the release of the
Bank of Japan's quarterly economic report, which market players
interpreted as indicating there would be no increase soon in the
bank's official discount rate, the interest it charges for loans to
commercial banks.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told reporters today that the
framework of international cooperation remains strong and
coordinated action will continue to ensure stability in foreign
exchange markets.
   He said U.S. concern over current dollar-yen exchange rates was
made clear at the weekend summit between President Bush and
Japanese Prime Minster Toshiki Kaifu in Palm Springs, Calif.
   In recent days, the dollar has been at its highest level since
mid-June last year. With a few pauses, it had gained 5.43 yen since
Feb. 19 before today's fall.
   The Bank of Japan was seen selling ``a couple billion dollars''
in today's trading to check the dollar's rise, traders said. The
central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities.
   Kanai said many market players reduced their dollar-holding
positions in case the Bank of Japan raises its discount rate
Wednesday. The bank's governor, Yasushi Mieno, leaves for Europe
Wednesday and there had been speculation the bank would raise the
rate before he leaves.
   Japanese market players had been expecting a discount rate
increase since after nationwide elections last month, to stem
inflationary pressure. After three increases last year, the
nation's key lending rate stands at 4.25 percent, still the lowest
among the group of seven advanced industrial nations.
   Growing uncertainties about the interest rate began discouraging
stock investment and yen-buying, and on Feb. 26 the Nikkei took its
second-largest plunge one-day ever, 1,569.10 points.

<HEAD>Whitney Museum Board Fires Director</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 15-year director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art has been fired amid complaints about his leadership, a
proposed expansion project and exhibitions a scholar derided as
contemporary schlock.
   The board's dismissal Monday of Thomas N. Armstrong III was
announced by museum president William Woodside.
   Woodside, in a statement, commended the director for having
``enlivened and invigorated'' the museum but said the board saw a
need for new leadership appropriate to the ``changing climate''
facing private cultural institutions.
   Armstrong declined to comment Monday.
   His dismissal came after months of speculation that the board
was dissatisfied with him.
   His critics said the museum lacked direction under him and cited
what they saw as trendy exhibitions, his failure to hire a strong
chief curator and his alienation of some donors.
   Woodside had asked Armstrong to resign late last year but
Armstrong refused and sought support from board members, art
dealers and donors. Supporters praised him in a petition signed
last week by more than 200 people.
   Some reports said he had made some anti-Semitic remarks, but one
board member, Robert W. Wilson, told The New York Times last month
the alleged remarks were being excluded from any consideration of
Armstrong's future.
   A scholar in American art told the Times in December that the
museum had exhibited ``too much contemporary schlock and too many
superficial exhibitions of meaningful American artists.'' The
scholar declined to be identified.
   Another problem concerned a proposed $37.5 million addition that
would double the museum's size. The plan, unveiled in 1985, drew
criticism because it proposed to wrap the new structure around the
original museum, which was designed by modernist architect Marcel
Breuer. The plans were revised.
   Woodside said a search committee will choose a new director.

<HEAD>Illinois GOP Fights Over Abortion, Taxes in Primary for Governor</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JOHN DOWLING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion and taxes are dividing
Republicans in a primary battle as the party desperately seeks to
hold onto its last major political bastion in Illinois _ the
governor's mansion.
   The embattled front-runner in the March 20 Republican primary is
Secretary of State Jim Edgar, a pro-choice moderate who is the
near-unanimous choice of the state GOP hierarchy to succeed
retiring four-term Gov. James R. Thompson.
   His chief opponent is Steven Baer, a 30-year-old conservative
political organizer who is attacking Edgar as a ``tax-and-spend
liberal'' and pro-abortion extremist.
   The contest has conservative stalwarts like Phyllis Schlafly and
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in opposing camps, and puts the national
party in the position of backing a candidate whose stand on
abortion and taxes bears little resemblance to its 1988 platform.
   But many elected Republicans and party leaders say victory is
more important than ideology in this race.
   ``We just can't afford to lose a governorship in a state like
Illinois in an off-year election,'' said Republican National
Chairman Lee Atwater. ``It's absolutely critical that we have the
strongest candidate, and that's Jim Edgar.''
   Edgar, 43, has been a rising star of the state GOP for nearly a
decade. Appointed by Thompson in 1981 to fill a vacancy in the
patronage-rich secretary of state's office, he won re-election
twice. He seemed to have scared off potential gubernatorial
opposition within his party last summer with a long list of
endorsements and a campaign bankroll that now stands at $3.2
million.
   Edgar declared that the state should make permanent a two-year,
20 percent state income tax increase approved by the Legislature in
June. He also bluntly stated his support for abortion rights,
including lifting the state's near-total ban on Medicaid-funded
abortions.
   Those stands brought to a boil the conservative discontent that
had simmered under Thompson, a moderate who vetoed anti-abortion
legislation on constitutional grounds and spent much of his current
term pushing for tax increases.
   ``Thompson was pro-abortion, but he wasn't as up-front about it
as Edgar,'' said Mrs. Schlafly, who is supporting Baer. ``Edgar
starts out his speech by saying he's pro-abortion.''
   Baer pledges to be ``a governor who can read our president's
lips'' and oppose higher taxes. He has put that message on
thousands of videotapes mailed to grass-roots Republicans, church
groups and anti-abortion activists.
   Baer argues that his anti-tax stance is an effective strategy
against the likely Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Attorney
General Neil Hartigan, who is pro-choice but has taken a
wait-and-see stance on extension of the tax increase.
   ``The Republican Party in Illinois can have its cake and eat it,
too,'' Baer said. ``We can win and still be able to sleep at
night.''
   Edgar said his views on abortion coincide with those of most
Illinoisans and added that his party should have learned a lesson
from the victories of pro-choice Democrats in recent New Jersey and
Virginia gubernatorial races.
   He said he has moved to win broad support within his party by
calling for curbs on government spending and assembling a
Conservatives for Edgar committee headed by Hyde, who acknowledges
that politics took precedence over philosophy in his endorsement.
   With Democrats likely to retain control of the Legislature in
the fall election, the gubernatorial race is the GOP's best hope
for gaining leverage in the legislative and congressional
reapportionment that begins in 1991.
   ``We don't control the Legislature, we don't control the mayor's
office in Chicago, we don't control a United States Senate seat,''
Edgar said. ``If we lose the governor's office, the Republican
Party is going to be a very distinct minority in Illinois.''

<HEAD>Reality of Rare Ritual Cloaked in Mystery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rare ritual of exorcism, practiced twice by
the New York Archdiocese in a year, is cloaked in mystery even for
those most familiar with it. But priests say the movie ``The
Exorcist'' depicted it pretty well.
   ``A lot of people think they know the answer, but my experience
is nobody really does,'' said the Rev. John Nicola, a priest with
the Washington Archdiocese who assisted at four exorcisms in Rome
from 1973 to 1975.
   He added, ``Even psychiatrists who have no belief in the
supernatural will tell you about cases.''
   Catholic theologians expressed surprise Monday that Cardinal
John J. O'Connor reported the two New York exorcisms. He made the
disclosure during a Sunday sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
which he said, ``Diabolically instigated violence is on the rise.''
   The cardinal said the exorcisms were approved by the
archdiocese's vicar general and appeared to be successful, but he
gave no details. He also said the novel ``The Exorcist'' is a
``gruesomely authentic'' portrayal of demonic possession.
   Nicola agreed. Being there, Nicola said, ``is quite scary.''
   Typically, said the Rev. James T. Burtchaell, theology professor
at Notre Dame University, an exorcist must be a ``very
self-possessed, consistently holy man'' to survive the experience.
   ``It involves a great deal of self-abuse, bodies being flung
around the room, excrement, assumed voices _ it's pretty vile
stuff,'' he said.
   ``The darn movie is going to be the image everybody has. But, I
must say, events in the movie are very faithful to stories I've
read'' about real exorcisms.
   Exorcisms are confidential; no figures are kept on the number
performed in the United States, said Bill Ryan, spokesman for the
U.S. Catholic Conference in Washington.
   But Nicola estimated investigations result in only one exorcism
every two years in this country. In Europe, some dioceses might
have five or 10 a year. In parts of Asia, Africa, South America and
Mexico, ``it might be an everyday thing.''
   Pope John Paul II recently increased the number of exorcists in
Rome and in Turin, where there are a reported 40,000 devil
worshipers, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in December.
   The Rev. Simon Harak, a Catholic priest and theology professor
at Fairfield University in Connecticut, said the church's book of
rituals recognizes exorcisms for people ``who are no longer in
charge of their own will.''
   Exorcism existed before the time of Christ, and Harak said it
may gain prevalence in times or places of satanic worship.
   ``In the gospels, there's quite a bit of reference to Jesus not
only healing people of diseases but freeing them from diabolical
possession,'' said Burtchaell. ``Ever since then, there have been
outbreaks of similar behavior.''
   Besides the most radical form of exorcism, there are ceremonies
dealing with evil spirits, including a baptismal prayer, more
common in the Roman Catholic Church.
   ``It's not like, `Oh, my goodness, William Peter Blatty's ``The
Exorcist.''' It's a recognition that there are good spirits,
angels, and bad spirits, devils,'' Harak said.

   State bar examiners decided not to grade
the afternoon session of the bar exam taken Feb. 28 in fairness to
Southern California applicants who were forced out of the test
center by an earthquake.
   The quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, forced about 800

test site.
   The would-be lawyers had about one hour and 15 minutes left in
testing time when the quake struck. It caused minor damage and
injuries in the region.
   An estimated 4,100 California applicants took the Multistate Bar
Examination last month, about 2,800 of them in Southern California.
   The Committee of Bar Examiners decided in emergency session it
would be unfair to grade the afternoon session for any of the
applicants.
   They said they will score each applicant based on the morning
session and then use a national sample of those who took the
Multistate to come up with an overall score.

<HEAD>South African Troops Try To Restore Order In Tribal Homeland</HEAD>
<HEAD>By BARRY RENFREW</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South African paratroopers
attempted today to end massive rioting and looting in the Ciskei
homeland that left at least 20 people dead and more than 550
injured in the wake of a military coup.
   South African forces set up road blocks around the Ciskei
capital of Bisho and sent out patrols as senior officers planned
the deployment of more troops, officials said. There were no
reports of any clashes involving South African forces, but looting
was continuing in some areas, they said.
   Doctors at hospitals in Ciskei and nearby East London in South
Africa said at least 20 people had been killed and more than 550
injured in two days of rioting and looting. They said most had
suffered gunshot and stabbing wounds.
   Rioting erupted after the Ciskei army ousted the nominally
independent homeland's authoritarian president in a bloodless coup.
   Sunday's coup was widely acclaimed by most Ciskeians, who
opposed the old government because of its authoritarian rule and
repression of anti-apartheid activists.
   President Lennox Sebe, 63, was on a trade mission in Hong Kong
when the military seized power. He had been in power since 1981.
   The coup leaders said they favor returning Ciskei to South
Africa. Many blacks accuse South Africa's white minority government
of creating such homelands to try to restrict blacks to the most
isolated and underdeveloped parts of the country.
   Ciskei, a 3,600-square-mile territory of about one million
people on the southeast coast, is one of 10 black homelands. None
is recognized as sovereign by any country other than South Africa.
   The jubilation over the coup turned to horror Monday when
thousands of people began looting and burning stores and factories.
More than 50 factories, many of them owned by Israeli and Taiwanese
firms, were burned as drunken mobs went on the rampage in several
towns.
   ``It was a drunken orgy of violence. It looks like a war zone.
Dozens of buildings were gutted,'' said local journalist Louise
Flanagan.
   South Africa sent in the troops at the request of Brig. Gen.
Oupa Gqozo, the coup leader and head of the new military
government. The Ciskei army, cheered by the rioters, made no
attempt to stop the lawlessness, eyewitnesses said.
   ``We didn't expect the jubilation of the people to turn into
such turmoil, but seeing that has happened we have asked for
further reinforcements from South Africa, and they have responded
positively,'' Gqozo told reporters.
   South Africa initially declined to intervene, but sent troops
into Ciskei after angry crowds menaced government buildings in
Bisho.
   Protesters initially attacked and looted shops belonging to
officials of the ousted Ciskei government. But the crowds began
attacking all businesses and hundreds of buildings, shops,
factories and vehicles were torched, witnesses said.
   Rioters, many of them drunk, broke into shops, removed goods
then set buildings ablaze with firebombs, the witnesses said.
Looters used wheelbarrows to haul away stoves, refrigerators and
other items, officials said.
   Foreign-owned factories were burned because the old government
attracted overseas investment by providing workers at wages of $50
a month or less. Working conditions reportedly were very harsh.
   Gqozo received a rousing cheer Monday when he told thousands of
people at a stadium in Bisho that the African National Congress and
other anti-apartheid groups would be free to engage in political
activity in Ciskei.
   The ANC is the main black group fighting the South African
government. President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC last month,
but some homeland leaders do not allow the group to operate in the
territories they control.
   Gqozo made the announcement following meetings Monday with the
ANC-aligned United Democratic Front.
   South Africa established the homelands in the 1960s in an
attempt to create separate, tribal-based states for blacks while
whites would retain control of national politics and the economy.
   Gqozo said he would like to see Ciskei relinquish its nominal
independence and return to South Africa. The Transkei homeland is
considering a similar plan. The South African government has not
taken a position on homelands that want to return to South Africa.

<HEAD>Report: $1 Million Runaway Fund Used for Loans to Board Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Bruce Ritter denied any wrongdoing in
setting up a trust fund of nearly $1 million for runaways that also
was used to make loans to two Covenant House board members and
Ritter's sister, The New York Times said today.
   Officials of Covenant House, built by Ritter into the nation's
biggest network of shelters for runaways, told the newspaper the
loans from the tax-exempt fund were made without the knowledge of
most members of the board.
   It was not known whether the loans were illegal, the newspaper
said; that would depend partly on what information was provided to
the Internal Revenue Service and the state attorney general.
   Ritter, who resigned last week as president of Covenant House
amid allegations of sexual misconduct involving young runaways,
confirmed the loans and said he did nothing wrong.
   ``I thought I was doing a good thing to take care of the kids,''
the Roman Catholic priest said.
   Ritter said he created the fund in 1983 out of his salary to
support Covenant House programs that the charity otherwise could
not afford. Covenant House later made contributions directly to the
fund, the newspaper said.
   The fund received tax-exempt status in 1984, said Edmund J.
Burns, its trustee.
   ``It was my salary,'' Ritter said. ``God help me, I earned it,
seven days a week, year-round.''
   Two board members who benefited from trust loans _ James J.
Maguire and Dr. James T. Kennedy _ recently resigned, the Times
said.
   Maguire in 1988 borrowed $100,000, which is still outstanding.
   Separately, in 1986, Maguire sold the trust five acres of
undeveloped land for $80,000. In 1989, the trust sold the land to
Kennedy for $120,000. Kennedy paid $30,000 cash and the trust gave
him a 10 percent mortgage on the balance, the Times said.
   In another instance, the trust made a 1987 loan of $131,000 to
Ritter's sister, Cassie Wallace, of Trenton, N.J., who was moving
to North Carolina and was having trouble selling her house, the
Times said.

<HEAD>Report: Soldiers Were Carrying Cocaine Out of Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. soldiers took payoffs of up to $10,000 from
Colombian drug suppliers to smuggle cocaine in their duffel bags
aboard military flights to the United States, CBS reported.
   The smuggling ring was broken up recently in Panama, the network
said Monday. Citing unidentified military sources, CBS said at
least seven Colombians and two Americans were arrested.
   One serviceman confessed that he recruited soldiers to smuggle
cocaine aboard the flights home, CBS said.
   The Pentagon referred questions about the report to the U.S.
Southern Command in Panama City. A spokesman there, Marjorie A.
Boggs, said, ``We are coordinating with investigative agencies to
see if there is anything to'' the report.
   The network said officials investigating Friday's grenade attack
on a Panama City discotheque in which a U.S. soldier was killed are
looking into the possibility the bombing was connected to the
breakup of the smuggling ring. The attack wounded 15 other American
servicemen and 12 Panamanians.
   It was the first such attack on U.S. soldiers in Panama since
the Dec. 20 invasion that ousted dictator Manuel Noriega.
   Military officials checked for drugs in the baggage of the
13,000 soldiers returning from the invasion, but the deployment was
so large it was almost impossible to conduct thorough searches,
officers told CBS.
   Witnesses to the bombing said two men yelling ``Long live
Noriega!'' threw a grenade through a glass wall of the disco, then
sped away in a car. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on drug charges in Miami, where he was
taken after the U.S. invasion.

<HEAD>Kaifu Urges Top Priority For Reform To Fight Trade Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu today told Parliament
that land prices must be driven down and government spending
increased if Japan is to reduce its huge trade surplus with the
United States.
   Low wages and expensive housing have kept Japanese from buying
more imports, making it difficult to cut into the $49 billion
surplus.
   ``Our corporations are wealthy and strong, but this wealth has
come at the expense of long working hours and a low standard of
living. It is time to redress this imbalance,'' he said.
   ``We intend realistic efforts to carry out structural reforms.
That means we must carry out reforms of our land use policies and
improve the standard of living,'' Kaifu said during questioning by
opposition legislators in the upper house of Parliament.
   Kaifu's opponents, led by the Socialists, the No. 1 opposition
party, dominate the upper house and are likely to obstruct action
on a number of trade-related issues facing Parliament.
   These include plans to provide more land for housing and cut
inflated real estate prices; and to spend more on roads, parks and
sewers to improve the general quality of life.
   Washington says such changes are needed to eliminate
``structural'' trade barriers behind the chronic U.S. trade deficit
with Japan.
   A key barrier U.S. officials have targeted is a law that they
say tends to prevent foreign firms from expanding their sales in
Japan. Today, trade ministry officials said they were considering
changing or abolishing that law.
   Minister of International Trade and Industry Kabun Muto,
reversing himself on the issue, told Japanese reporters bolder
steps might have to be taken if the United States is not satisfied
with plans to ease the law's enforcement.
   U.S. trade negotiators contend it hinders foreign retailers who
are trying to open stories in Japan as well as discourages the
opening of large Japanese stores that are more likely to sell
foreign-made goods than traditional mom-and-pop shops.
   Kaifu promised President Bush to do his best to carry out
substantial reforms during a California summit last week. But he is
fighting his government's tendency to become bogged down in
domestic disputes.
   Japan's Parliament was embroiled in battles over a bribery
scandal and over a controversial sales tax and has accomplished few
trade-related reforms during the past year.
   Parliament must first deal with a revised version of the 3
percent sales tax and a national budget by the end of this month. A
revision of the sales tax exempting food, school entrance fees and
welfare in response to widespread criticism was scheduled to go
before Parliament today.
   Kaifu is urging Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi and
other opposition leaders to abandon their attacks on the sales tax,
given the comfortable majority his party won in Feb. 18
parliamentary elections.
   Opposition parties unsuccessfully based their campaigns in last
month's lower house election on calls to abolish the sales tax,
which along with a series of sex and money scandals eroded public
support for the governing party and contributed to its loss of
control of Parliament's upper house in July elections.
   While analysts are skeptical about Kaifu's chances of following
through on his promises to Bush, the reforms are widely supported
by major business organizations and the media.
   Joining other business groups, the Kansai Economic Federation in
western Japan urged the government Monday to raise taxes on
farmland in major cities to the same level as residential taxes to
encourage development of suburban farmland.
   It also called for measures to narrow the gap between prices in
Japan and overseas.
   Japanese officials, however, have expressed concern that Kaifu,
who lacks clout in his own party, will have problems gathering
support for reforms soon enough to satisfy the United States.
   Tokyo is under pressure to show it will implement promised
reforms before early April, when trade negotiators are to issue an
interim report on the U.S.-Japanese talks. A final report is due in
July.
   Also today, a top Japanese defense official said Japan is ready
to consider increasing funds for maintaining U.S. forces in Japan,
if such a request is officially made by the United States.
   ``If the U.S. side makes a request in concrete terms, we will
consider'' increasing expenses for U.S. troops in Japan, Yozo
Ishikawa, director general of the Defense Agency, told a news
conference.
   But Ishikawa, who assumed the agency's top post Feb. 28, said he
has heard nothing ``official'' about the request yet.
   Ishikawa was referring to a statement by U.S. Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney during a television interview Sunday that he wants
Japan to assume ``100 percent'' of the cost of maintaining U.S.
military bases in Japan.
   Japan is currently paying $2.4 billion of the $6 billion annual
cost of maintaining U.S. forces in Japan, a defense agency official
said. Such costs include the salaries of the 22,240 Japanese
employees at U.S. miltary facilities across Japan.
   About 50,000 U.S. military personnel are based in Japan and
their salaries and other costs are not included in the maintainance
equation.

   Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, the newspaper heiress
who died last week, left controlling interest of The New York Times
to her four children.
   Her 19-page will was filed Monday for probate.
   Mrs. Sulzberger, who died Feb. 26 at age 97 in Stamford, Conn.,
executed the will Jan. 24. The terms of her father's will had
required that her controlling interest in the Times pass to her
children after her death.
   A part owner of the Times, Mrs. Sulzberger left all of her stock
in the newspaper and the Times Printing Co. equally to three
daughters and a son: Marian S. Heiskell of New York; Ruth Holmberg
of Chattanooga, Tenn.; Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger of New York, and
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger of New York, the Times' publisher.
   ``They will, I am confident, continue to carry out the policy
which was initiated by my father and strengthened by my husband,''
Mrs. Sulzberger said in her will. ``By doing so they will be
preserving and advancing the best interests and the finest
traditions of the great property which they will inherit.''
   Mrs. Sulzberger's will provides numerous cash bequests of
varying amounts to many relatives, including grandsons and
granddaughters.
   Several organizations were left $100,000 each, including Barnard
College, Columbia University, the New York Botanical Gardens and
the New York Public Library. Among other bequests, the United Negro
College Fund got $50,000.

   A man was sentenced to four years in
prison for setting a fire that destroyed a historic black church
founded by escaped slaves during the Civil War.
   Circuit Judge Edward C. Ferguson imposed the sentence Monday on
James Russell Calvin, 21, of Alton, who had pleaded guilty to arson
in the 1988 fire.
   The attack was the second in a year against the New Bethel
African Methodist Episcopal Church in Godfrey. It was rebuilt a
second time after Calvin's arson attack.
   The congregation's 25 members are descendants of the escaped
slaves who founded the church in 1864.
   Calvin, who is white, maintained that the attack was not
racially motivated but resulted from his alcoholism and stress
caused by personal problems. At the time, he told police he
believed the church was used for devil worship.
   Defense attorney Jim Wallis said his client has ``suffered the
fire of hell in his remorse.''
   The prosecution had called for the maximum, seven years in
prison.
   ``He did that with malice in his heart,'' said State's Attorney
Bill Haine. ``This was an attack on an entire church congregation.''

   Scores of police officers in riot gear
helped calm hundreds of teen-agers who hurled bottles, looted a
store and vandalized cars during a protest against what they said
were racist school hiring policies.
   Six teen-agers were arrested and one minor injury was reported
Monday, said police Sgt. John Beerling.
   The demonstration was held in support of Hawthorne High School
Principal Ken Crowe, who recently announced his resignation because
he was going to be reassigned.
   Crowe, who is black, has accused the school board of failing to
support his attempts to rid the school of racial harassment.
   A racially mixed crowd of about 400 students from Leuzinger High
School in Lawndale left classes in the morning and marched more
than a mile to Hawthorne High School, 15 miles from downtown Los
Angeles. The schools are in the same district.
   ``During the march, the students became unruly and began
rioting,'' Beerling said. He added that damage was confined to a
few broken windows and dented fenders.
   ``We went there peacefully to try to stop the racism,'' said
Monica Fritsch, a 16-year-old Leuzinger student. ``Then the gangs
started fighting. ... We know the schools are cross-town rivals,
but we were trying to forget about that.''
   About 100 police officers herded many of the protesters onto the
school football field, where officials heard their complaints of
discriminatory hiring practices, Sgt. Mike Effler said. The
students were later bused back to their school.
   Officer Kathy Burnett said the students were arrested on
misdemeanor violations that included disorderly conduct and were
released to their parents.
   One merchant along the march route complained that students had
vandalized his shop. Ted Shin said more than 100 teen-agers rushed
into his convenience store and stole merchandise.

74.
   Merrill appeared in 42 films during a four-decade career.
   His first movie role was in ``Winged Victory'' in 1944. He went
on to ``Twelve O'Clock High'' in 1949 and had parts in ``Phone Call

   On television, he played the gruff but understanding Dr.
Gillespie in the ``Young Dr. Kildare'' series.
   He met Miss Davis in ``All About Eve,'' winner of the
best-picture Academy Award that starred Miss Davis in 1950. He
played her lover and they married in July of that year, the day his
divorce from his first wife became final.
   Their marriage ended in divorce in 1960. It wasn't until 1985
that she ended a 15-year silence by sending a note to Merrill after
he urged people not to buy ``My Mother's Keeper,'' a critical
biography of the actress written by her daughter.

   In cities of the Slavic heartland, voters
supported pro-democracy candidates who promise accountability over
Communist bosses who have long controlled municipal machines
through patronage, activists said.
   Even in Leningrad, traditionally a bastion of hard-line
Communists, pro-democracy candidates dominated Sunday's local and
republic-wide elections, said editor Yelena Velinksaya of the
official youth news agency IMA Press.
   Most of the 1,800 contests for seats in the legislatures of the
Russian federation, the Ukraine and Byleorussia remained undecided
and will have to be settled by runoffs expected in two weeks.
   But unofficial returns suggested that progressives made
substantial gains as voters rejected conservative Communist
candidates they associated with corruption and economic
mismanagement.
   Advocates of democracy could secure control several major city
councils.
   Heavy turnout appeared to favor reformers in the Ukraine and
Byelorussia, where 80 percent of registered voters went to the
polls, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said today.
   The newspaper said, however, that only 64 percent of registered
voters turned out in Moscow, capital of the huge Russian
federation. Turnout figures for the federation as a whole were not
yet available.
   Reformer Boris N. Yeltsin had no trouble winning a legislative
seat in the Russian federation, taking 72 percent of the vote in
his district of Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains. He defeated 11
other candidates, said Anatoly Moiseyev of the Russian Federation
Election Commission.
   Yeltsin has said he will seek the presidency of the republic,
which traditionally means a place on the Communist Party's ruling
Politburo.
   That could return the Communist maverick to the membership he
lost in February 1988 for advocating speedier change.
   Other reformers in the Russian federation also appeared headed
for victory, as did leaders of nationalist movements in the Ukraine
and Byelorussia, an outspoken television commentator in Leningrad
and a defiant editor in Moscow.
   ``We're so happy! Such success!'' said Irina Rozhenko of the
Ukrainian pro-democracy movement Narodny Rukh.
   Activists said strong showings in this round nearly guaranteed
victories in runoff elections for candidates who want to step up
the pace of reforms begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Margaret Tutweiler
said Monday that, ``While, for the most part, these were not
multiparty elections, there were, nonetheless, many hotly
contested, competitive regional and local races, offering voters a
clear choice of candidates and ideologies.
   ``This represents an important and, indeed, historic step
forward in the process of democratization in the Soviet Union,''
she said.
   In fact, the Communist Party is still the only legal political
party in the Soviet Union despite its agreement last month to end
its political monopoly and compete with other parties.
   So pro-reform candidates either had to run as Communists or on
slates of grass-roots movements.
   Defeat of old guard local Communist leaders probably would help
Gorbachev's liberalization. He has railed against functionaries who
hamper reform, and people hoping to exercise new economic freedoms
have told of crippling obstacles erected by local party officials.
   Zyanon Paznyak, leader of the Byelorussian People's Front, got
59 percent of the vote in his Minsk district, said spokesman Victor
Ivashkevich.
   He said activist candidates appeared to have carried cities but
that party apparatchiks, including Byelorussian party chief Yefrem
Sokolov, won rural districts.
   In Leningrad, Bella Kurkova, controversial commentator from the
public affairs program ``Fifth Wheel,'' appeared to be the only
first-round winner, said IMA Press.
   Ms. Velinskaya said pro-democracy candidates dominated the
elections in Leningrad and that just two of about 150 candidates
supported by the ultra-right nationalist group Pamyat survived the
first round.
   Vladislav Starkov, editor of the country's most popular
newspaper, Arguments and Facts, was reported the winner of a seat
to the Russian republic's parliament.
   Starkov ignored a strong suggestion from Gorbachev that he quit
last year after the paper printed results of a poll implying that
the late human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov was more popular
than Gorbachev.
   Unofficial reports said well-known dissident Sergei Kovalyov
also won a seat in the Russian parliament.
   Ukraine party chief Vladimir A. Ivashko, considered a moderate
protege of Gorbachev, qualified for a runoff against an opponent
backed by Narodny Rukh. Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, president of the
Russian republic, defeated a lone opponent in the city of
Krasnodar, winning 71.3 percent of the votes cast.
   Both are Politburo members.
   Narodny Rukh members said the movement's leader, poet Ivan
Drach, was elected in the first round along with several other
prominent activists.
   Official reports said 86 percent of the candidates in the
Russian elections and 80 percent in the Ukraine were members of the
Communist Party.
   Political tension has increased in some regions as direct
control from the Kremlin decreases. In recent weeks, Gorbachev has
prodded the Communist Party into giving up its monopoly on power
and pressed for a new, more powerful presidency.
   In Lithuania, candidates of the pro-independence Sajudis
movement swept earlier legislative elections and won more seats in
runoffs Sunday. Of the 25 candidates elected Sunday, 18 were from
Sajudis, according to reports from activists and the official news
agency Tass.
   Some activists in the Baltic republic want the legislature to
vote on secession from the Soviet Union before Gorbachev gets his
new powers, which would include the right to suspend the
legislature of a republic and send in troops.

<TEXT>
   Homeless people seized and moved into
federally-owned vacant houses in three cities, threatening to stay
until the government does more to provide affordable housing for
the poor.
   Activists with the Philadelphia-based Union of the Homeless on
Monday took over five houses in Philadelphia and one each in
Alexandria, Va., and Detroit, leaders said. Police in New York City
thwarted an attempt there to move into a house.
   Ronald Darnaby of the Philadelphia union said the coalition
checked with HUD's inventory to identify houses for sale, then
discussed the proposed seizures with community leaders.
   The two-story homes would house two families each. None of the
houses had utilities, Darnaby said.
   Inside one of the houses, protesters and homeless people wearing
coats huddled around kerosene heaters and sipped hot drinks while
about 20 other members picketed outside. ``We'll stay as long as it
takes,'' said Charles Thompson.
   Craig Gaskin, a spokesman for the homeless union, said the
squatters would stay until their demands are met or they are
removed by police.
   The coordinator for the homeless for HUD's regional office in
Philadelphia, Pat Mulligan, said his agency considered the seizures
trespassing but that officials had not decided how to respond.
   City officials sent in building inspectors but no police
officers. Lt. Ed Kachigian said the city would not act against the
homeless unless HUD requested it.
   In October, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said HUD would take 10
percent of its single-family inventory for affordable housing for
homeless people. But the union said it wants action immediately.
   ``We are sick and tired of empty promises,'' union President
Leona Smith said. ``The government is more committed to bailing out
mismanaged savings and loans banks than to saving and restoring the
lives of people who are homeless, chronically unemployed and who
are being pressed into a permanent underclass status.''
   The organization wants more money earmarked for remodeling or
construction of low-income housing and for rent subsidies.
   In Manhattan, about 30 members of the union were thwarted by
police in an attempt to take a house, said union member Renaldo
Casanova. He said two members of the group were arrested.
   Casanova said Monday's activities were a prelude to a May Day
event in which the union plans to have activists in 40 states
simultaneously occupy vacant, HUD-owned houses.
   Philadelphia Housing Commissioner Ed Schwartz offered to act as
a mediator between the homeless and HUD, a role he played two years
ago when the group seized several houses. HUD later sold those
houses to the homeless group.
   Mulligan said the agency gives priority to shelter groups when
selling houses and offers leases for $1 a year.

   Stiff desert winds slowed
efforts to prepare space shuttle Atlantis for a piggyback jet ride
back to Florida.
   Gusts to 45 mph also delayed an investigation into an apparent
leak of hydraulic fluid discovered before the shuttle landed here
Sunday from a secret, 4{-day mission during which it put a $500
million spy satellite in orbit.
   ``As far as the landing, it was not a safety issue,'' Conrad
Nagel, Atlantis processing director for NASA, said of the leak.
   Meanwhile, Discovery was towed Monday to an assembly building at
Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA spokeswoman Pat Phillips said.
   Inside, booster rockets and the external fuel tank will be
attached to Discovery, which is scheduled for launch April 12 on a
mission to put the $1.55 billion Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
   Atlantis was towed off its dry lakebed landing strip and into a
100-foot steel maintenance structure. But the wind prevented NASA
from hoisting the shuttle as planned Monday morning, slowing work
by about 16 hours, Nagel said.
   Nagel said the delay forced officials to postpone the trip atop
a modified Boeing 747 to Florida from Friday to Saturday.
   The possible leak of bright red hydraulic fluid was discovered
as Atlantis approached landing. Sensors showed a brief pressure
drop in the main hydraulic system.
   The system operates control surfaces that steer the spacecraft
under computer orders during re-entry, Nagel said.
   Overall, he said, the shuttle was in excellent condition. Only
one heat-shield tile may need replacement. About 20 other tiles
sustained ``dings'' up to an inch in size, while about 40 others
had nicks of a half inch or less.
   Atlantis is scheduled to fly again July 9 on another secret
mission.

<TEXT>
   A storm that dumped heavy snow in the upper Rockies threatened
to blanket the northern Plains today, and rain was to follow the
storm in the central Plains.
   Along a stationary front Monday, rain was scattered from
northern Texas to Nebraska and from the mid-Mississippi Valley to
the upper Ohio Valley.
   Moline, Ill., received a third of an inch of rain, and snow
extended from northern Illinois to the lower Great Lakes region.
   Dry weather prevailed across much of the nation Monday, with
fair skies covering most of a southern band running from the South
to the West. Calm skies also covered New England and upstate New
York.
   The storm crossing the Rockies left in its wake strong winds in
the mountains and desert areas of Southern California. Gusts of 55
mph were reported Monday at the Mojave Airport.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell in Snowbird and Alta by midafternoon
Monday, as a winter storm left parts of Montana, Wyoming and Utah
covered in white.
   Snow was predicted today for much of the Rockies, from the
northern highlands and mountains of New Mexico up through the
ranges of Colorado and into central and south central Montana.
   The storm was expected to enter western Nebraska and southwest
and south central South Dakota today.
   Temperatures in the Great Lakes and northern New England stayed
in the 20s and upper teens, while the northeast and north central
United States received highs in the 30s and 40s.
   Temperatures were in the 60s and 70s from the south central
Plains to the Southeast. Southern Florida and the lower Rio Grande
valley were in the 80s.
   Afternoon highs in the Southwest were mostly in the 60s.
   The high for the nation Monday was 88 degrees at Presidio, Texas.

   The dollar was mixed against most other major
currencies in European trading today. Gold prices were up.
   Dealers said the dollar still was smarting from Monday's heavy
central bank interventions to stem the dollar's rise.
   Despite the interventions, dealers said, the dollar still was
very well supported.
   ``The only people really selling the dollar are the central
banks,'' said Graham Leverton, corporate adviser at Bank of America
in London.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.45 yen to a closing 149.50 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 149.70 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _ 1.6975 West German marks, down from 1.7035
   _ 1.4969 Swiss francs, down from 1.4985

   In London, British pound rose to $1.6530 from $1.6390 late
Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $404.50 a troy ounce, up
from $403.75 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $404.80.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $405.00, up from bid $403.25 late
Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.29 to close at a bid $404.73.

<HEAD>Kohl Agrees On Parliament Treaty Resolution, No Concessions Asked
From Poles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has agreed to
formally state support for a treaty on Poland's western border
without asking for concessions from the Poles, his chief of staff
said today.
   The announcement followed a crucial meeting of Kohl's coalition
government, which was seriously divided over the chancellor's
previous handling of the border issue.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, said the coalition
partners had agreed to introduce a resolution in Parliament on
Thursday favoring a treaty recognizing the current borders with
Poland.
   Seiters said the resolution would not include Kohl's demands,
made Friday, that any such treaty be linked with assurances by
Poland to honor its 1953 decision not to seek war reparations from
Germany, and its pledge last year to guarantee the ethnic rights of
its German minority.
   It was not clear whether the resolution would state _ as Kohl
has many times insisted _ that only the government of a united
Germany can have final say on the border issue.
   Kohl's previous pronouncements on the border issue have angered
the Poles and resulted in severe criticism at home, even from his
junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats of Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   Genscher and Kohl failed to settle their differences in a
meeting on Monday. Leaders of Kohl's coalition government met again
today to try to reach a compromise.
   Seiters made the announcement following that meeting.

<TEXT>
   The uncertainties looming ahead with the
prospect of German reunification have given East Germans cold feet
and touched off a new political crisis in West Germany.
   East Germany's leading politicians on Monday called for a new
social charter to be adopted in both Germanys that would preserve
the protections they have enjoyed under socialism, like guaranteed
employment and affordable rent and food prices.
   The proposed social charter adopted at weekly negotiations
between the Communists and 15 other parties reflects just how
hesitant many East Germans are about plunging ahead with a merger
with capitalist West Germany and abandoning the life they've known
for 40 years.
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl fueled the controversy raging
over his refusal to unequivocally recognize Germany's border with
Poland.
   He told reporters Monday that Germans should be wary of Poland's
1953 pledge not to seek World War II reparations, contending Polish
officials have been pressing claims for the past three years for
compensation of forced labor by Poles under the Third Reich.
   But Kohl backed off the reparations issue today. His chief of
staff, Rudolf Seiters, said Kohl agreed to formally state support
for a treaty on Poland's western border without asking for
concessions from the Poles.
   The announcement followed a crucial meeting of Kohl's coalition
government, which has been seriously divided over the chancellor's
handling of the border issue.
   Seiters said the coalition partners agreed to introduce a
resolution in Parliament Thursday favoring a treaty recognizing the
current borders with Poland.
   It was not clear whether the resolution would state _ as Kohl
has many times insisted _ that only the government of a united
Germany can have final say on the border issue.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland has called on the
two Germanys to begin talks aimed at a treaty recognizing the
current border _ formed by the Oder and Neisse rivers _ as the
permanent boundary between Poland and a united Germany.
   About a third of modern-day Poland was German territory prior to
World War II, and Warsaw fears a united Germany might seek to
recover the regions.
   The chancellor's obstinance angered Poles, opposition Social
Democrats in West Germany, the World War II Allies who retain
control of Berlin, and even members of his own center-right
coalition government.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher had distanced himself
from Kohl on the border issue and warned him that reopening the
issue of war reparations for Poland could backfire.
   Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Union governs in
partnership with Genscher's liberal Free Democrats and with the
arch-conservative Christian Social Union of Bavaria.
   The Christian Social Union's chairman, Theo Waigel, last year
called for unification within the 1937 borders of Germany, which
would include the huge territorities of Silesia and East Prussia
lost to Poland and the Soviet Union after the Nazi defeat in 1945.
   The Christian Democrats and Free Democrats also appear to be at
odds over how unification should be accomplished, with Kohl's party
urging a unilateral decision by East German states to merge with
West Germany.
   A leading parliamentarian of the Free Democratic Party, Burkhard
Hirsch, contends no right of secession exists for that East German
states.
   The opposition Social Democrats oppose an immediate vote by a
newly seated East German Parliament to merge with West Germany,
calling instead for a convention to draft a joint constitution.
   The social charter adopted at the East German political talks
demands that the right to work and the right to housing be
enshrined in a new constitution for a united Germany.
   If adopted by the East German Parliament chosen in the March 18
election, the charter should serve as the basis for negotiations
with West Germany on monetary and social union, opposition minister
Gerhard Poppe said.
   The charter proposal illustrates the strong social democratic
leaning of East Germany's political forces. The country's Social
Democrats are expected to poll a majority in the election.
   East Germans have traditionally viewed their social security
programs as the paramount achievement of over 40 years of Communist
rule and are nervous about the prospects of a headlong plunge into
capitalism's cold waters.
   Once efficient Western methods are introduced to East Germany's
government-controlled industry, for example, the now-negligible
unemployment rate among the country's 9 million-strong workforce
could jump to as much as 15 percent. Rent prices are also likely to
surge.
   East Germans in general know little about West Germany's social
security system, viewed as one of Western Europe's most generous.
   The conservative Alliance for Germany, the East German political
grouping backed by Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, has appealed
to voters not to fear the switch to capitalism.
   Social Minister Norbert Bluem of West Germany appeared at a news
conference with leaders of the East German Christian Democrats and
noted that the Bonn government already spends about $410 billion
per year on social services, or more than $6,500 per capita.

   Racial tensions at a shopping mall should
be eased by an agreement to hire more blacks, promote black-owned
businesses and end racial harassment, officials say.
   ``I think when you hire people and give them economic
opportunity, it has a tendency to cut down on some of the racial
strife,'' state Sen. Kay Patterson, said Monday.
   The agreement calls for hiring and promoting more blacks by the
Columbia Mall management and encouraging stores to do the same, and
using more black contractors and suppliers. Management would also
would no longer use a segregation-era trespassing law to detain
blacks.
   Patterson, who led other black officials in calling for the
resignation of a sheriff who allegedly used a racial slur in
describing how crime at the mall could be reduced, said the pact
with the mall was ``long, long overdue.''
   Dr. William F. Gibson, national chairman of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the
agreement was the first of its kind, but the problems at Columbia
Mall were not unique. He urged other NAACP chapters to negotiate
similar agreements.
   Informal studies show blacks make up 30 percent to 40 percent of
the mall's 150,000 weekly customers, Gibson said.
   The agreement was reached in the ``spirit of cooperation'' but
is not legally binding on the mall, said George Forbes, an attorney
for the mall's owner, Jacobs, Visconi and Jacobs of Cleveland.
   ``The Columbia Mall does not, it has not and it will not
discriminate as regards to race, creed or color,'' added Forbes, a
longtime member of the NAACP.
   The pact stemmed from allegations that about 50 black teen-agers
had been detained last summer by mall security officers under a
1960s anti-trespassing law designed to maintain segregation. In
most cases, no criminal charges were ever filed.
   In December, two black teen-agers were shot inside the mall, the
latest of four such incidents.
   The mall discontinued its practice of detaining black youths
under the trespass law about a month ago, Jacobs said.

<HEAD>Actor Gary Merrill Dies of Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FALMOUTH, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gary Merrill spent his final years on the
Maine coast doing very little _ which suited the actor who died at
his home of lung cancer. He was 74.
   ``I've spent my life doing as little as possible ... And I
intend to keep doing exactly the same thing,'' Merrill told an
interviewer in 1981. He said he enjoyed being ``a hermit.''
   Merrill, who moved to Maine in 1965 and spent most of his time
playing golf and reading poetry in schools, died Monday at his
small cottage overlooking the ocean in the wealthy Portland suburb
of Falmouth Foreside.
   Merrill was best known for his supporting roles in the movies
``Twelve O'Clock High'' and ``All About Eve'' and for his stormy
marriage to actress Bette Davis. He also was a long time escort of
actress Rita Hayworth. His first movie role was in ``Winged
Victory'' in 1944.
   The colorful, spirited actor, whose penchant for skirts on hot
days was known in the Portland area, appeared in 42 films over more
than 40 years.
   He first appeared on stage in 1937 and went on to play the gruff
but understanding Dr. Gillespie in the ``Young Dr. Kildare''
television series and he narrated ``The Valliant Years'' series
about Winston Churchill.
   His last stage appearance was on Broadway in 1980 in a revival
of ``Mornings at Seven'' with Maureen O'Sullivan.
   Merrill's other movie roles included ``Phone Call from a
Stranger,'' 1953; ``Blueprint for Murder,'' 1953; ``Bermuda
Affair,'' 1956, and ``Around the World Under the Sea,'' 1966.
   His trademark, a deep, rich voice, was heard in commercials
after he quit acting, including eight years as the voice for a beer
company's ads.
   Merrill met Davis in ``All About Eve'' in 1950 and married her
in July of that year, the same day his divorce from his first wife
became final.
   The marriage with Davis ended in divorce in 1960. Davis ended a
15-year silence in 1985 by writing a note to Merrill after he
paraded outside a bookstore with a sign urging shoppers not to buy
``My Mother's Keeper,'' a critical biography of Davis by her
daughter.
   A native of Hartford, Conn., Merrill spent many childhood
summers in Maine, and he and Davis spent much of their 10-year
marriage in Cape Elizabeth, just outside Portland.
   In his 1988 autobiography, ``Bette, Rita and the Rest of My
Life,'' Merrill said his best times were spent with Davis and their
children in Cape Elizabeth.
   He insisted he had been only an ``adequate actor'' because he
``never worked at it. I had no drive, really. I just like to get by
and have fun,'' he said.
   The unabashed free spirit, when asked why he was wearing a skirt
in downtown Portland one summer day in 1984, said, ``I believe in
wearing no clothes at all, and this is the closest you can get to
it in public.''
   Merrill is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Margot; a
brother and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
   A Tehran newspaper close to Iran's
president said today that 1990 will be the last year of captivity
for the hostages in Lebanon, and resumption of U.S.-Iranian ties is
not a precondition for their release.
   In a second editorial, the English-language Tehran Times said
Syrian President Hafez Assad would visit Tehran soon, after an
expected trip by his foreign minister, Farouk Al-Sharaa. It also
denied reports that a trip by the brother of President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to the Syrian capital of Damascus last week was related
to the hostage question.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, with 40,000 troops
there.
   Both editorials in the government newspaper were excerpted by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia.
   Recent statements from Iranian newspapers saying the hostages
should be released, along with optimistic assessments by Syrian and
other officials, have fueled reports that a hostage release is
imminent.
   In Beirut today, the respected An-Nahar daily ruled out any
release soon, but quoted unidentified Lebanese fundamentalist
sources as saying Iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue.
   The sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct
contacts between Iran and the United States, but both were scouting
for what was described as a mechanism for releasing the hostages.
The report did not elaborate.
   An Assad visit to Iran was expected. Syria was Persian Iran's
only staunch Arab backer in its 1980-88 war against Iraq, the arch
foe of Damascus. Iran and Syria are also in frequent contact over
Lebanon, where they back rival Shiite Moslem militias.
   The Tehran Times statement said visits between capitals was ``a
very normal thing,'' noting that the sensation on the hostage issue
created by the Western media over such visits was ``much too
fancied.''
   For the second time in as many weeks, the newspaper said the 18
Westerners in Lebanon, believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
factions, should go free without preconditions.
   In the past, the paper has reflected the thinking of President
Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``Our own assessment indicates that this thorny issue can be
sorted out in the near future in a sincere spirit by sincere
people,'' the paper said, adding, ``1990 can and will be the last
year of the captivity of these hostages.''
   It said an effort was under way to free the hostages because
``Islam in no way allows or condones the idea that people should be
taken or held hostage.''
   In Washington on Monday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said there were no grounds for expecting an imminent release, but
said many people outside the U.S. government were involved in talks
to win their freedom.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who will mark his 5th
anniversary in captivity on March 16. Anderson is one of the eight
Americans in captivity along with four Britons, two West Germans,
two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Rafsanjani has indicated the desire to separate Iran from the
hostage issue as he seeks Western technology and financing to
rebuild Iran's troubled economy.
   But the factions holding the hostages are said to be more loyal
to radicals in the Tehran government who oppose Rafsanjani. They
viewing confrontation with the West as the wellspring of the
Islamic revolution.
   The Tehran Times said today that there were no direct talks
between Tehran and Washington on resuming relations, according to
the IRNA report, which was monitored in Nicosia.
   ``At this hour, Iran-U.S. relations are not under discussion and
such a move is also not supported by the leader of the Islamic
Republic and its top officials,'' said the paper.
   It reiterated its ground-breaking Feb. 22 statement that the
hostage ordeal should be solved without any preconditions, and
should not be related to resuming ties with Washington.
   Ties were broken following the 1979 attack on the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran that resulted in 52 Americans being held hostage for 444
days.
   The paper said the visit to Damascus by Mahmoud Hashemi had
nothing to do with freedom for the hostages.
   A Syrian source, who refused to be identified further, said
Sunday that the meeting between Hashemi, a foreign ministry
official, and Syria's Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa was to
coordinate efforts to gain the release of all the hostages.
   The source said Hashemi had arrived from Beirut, where he met
with senior Shiite Moslem figures on the hostage issue.

   David Rappaport, a dwarf who starred in the
series ``The Wizard'' and played a wily lawyer on ``L.A. Law,'' was
in stable condition today after trying to kill himself by inhaling
car exhaust, authorities said.
   Police officers said the 3-foot, 11-inch actor had stopped
breathing when they found him inside a car on Sunday night. The
engine was running and a hose connected to the exhaust pipe ran
inside the car, said Sgt. Albert Dravidzius.
   Officers used cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive him, the
sergeant said.
   Rappaport, 38, was taken to Queen of Angels-Hollywood
Presbyterian Medical Center.
   No other information was released at the family's request.
   In CBS's ``The Wizard,'' which was broadcast from 1986-87,
Rappaport starred as Simon Mckay, a good-willed inventor.
   The actor appeared on NBC's ``L.A. Law'' as a lawyer who bests
his opponents by playing up his short stature. He also appeared in
the 1981 movie ``Time Bandits.''

   Many of the 20,000 Communist Party
employees who lost their jobs when the party was dissolved are
having a hard time finding new work, some because of
discrimination, a newspaper reported.
   The provincial and local party secretaries, instructors,
drivers, clerical workers, porters and others employed by the party
were fired when the discredited Communist Party dissolved itself in
January.
   Trybuna, the newspaper of the Social Democracy party which
replaced the former ruling party, said Monday that most of those
dismissed have reported to labor offices in need of new jobs.
   ``The return to normal work is sometimes difficult,'' the
newspaper said.
   It implied that part of the problem was an ``anti-Communist''
bias fueled by local Solidarity leaders.
   ``A director of an enterprise, uncertain of his own future, is
not that eager to hire former employees of the party apparatus,''
the Trybuna article said. ``He is simply afraid that at some point
somebody might accuse him of maintaining contacts with the former
Communist Party.''
   ``As we can see, anti-Communist pressure is big. There are
enterprises ... where they say that in case of workforce
reductions, the first to be fired will be former Communist Party
members,'' the newspaper said. ``Such an attitude doesn't have much
in common with the government's promise that the only criterion
will be skill.''
   Discrimination against Communists would be a reversal of decades
of bias against opposition activists.
   After the 1981 martial-law crackdown to repress Solidarity, for
example, thousands of workers had to ``verify'' their loyalty to
the Communist government, and those considered politically suspect
lost their jobs.
   Former Communist bosses also often held significiant power in
the assignment of jobs and privileges on the local level, where the
party and the government were intertwined.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, taking charge of the East
bloc's first non-Communist government last fall, said there should
be no vengeful purge of party loyalists from central or local
governments, institutions or businesses.

<HEAD>Rulings Will Make It More Difficult for Criminals to Get Federal
Court Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new Supreme Court rulings will make it
much more difficult for convicted criminals, including many of the
nation's 2,200 death row inmates, to get help in federal courts.
   The rulings generally bar defendants from invoking new
constitutional decisions to attack their state court convictions
after they have exhausted their initial round of appeals.
   That means prisoners may not base their appeals on favorable
court rulings issued in other cases after their own convictions
become final in state appellate courts.
   By identical 5-4 splits, the court Monday upheld death sentences
for two men on death row in South Carolina and Oklahoma.
   In each case, the court's conservative bloc _ Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy _ joined to form
the majority.
   In each, the court's liberals _ Justices William J. Brennan,
Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens _
dissented.
   The court's new and stringent rule was announced in the case of
South Carolina death row inmate Horace Butler. It evoked a sharp
dissenting opinion by Brennan.
   ``After today,'' he wrote for the four dissenters, ``despite
constitutional defects in the state process leading to their
conviction or sentencing, state prisoners will languish in jail _
or others like Butler will die _ because state courts were
reasonable, even though wrong.''
   Brennan said that with the ruling in Butler's case, ``the court
has finally succeeded in its thinly veiled crusade to eviscerate''
federal laws passed by Congress to protect criminal defendants'
rights.
   Writing for the majority, Rehnquist said federal courts should
not review ``reasonable good-faith interpretations of existing
precedents made by state courts even though they are shown to be
contrary to later decisions.''
   In the Oklahoma case of Robyn Leroy Parks, the court said he is
barred from contending that a jury wrongly was told to ignore
``sympathy'' before it sentenced him to death.
   The court said Parks should not have been allowed to raise such
a constitutional argument in a federal court challenge after having
exhausted his direct appeals in state courts.
   The presiding judge told Parks' sentencing jury, ``You must
avoid any influence of sympathy, sentiment, passion, prejudice or
other arbitrary factor when imposing sentence.''
   The justices left unanswered whether such a jury instruction is
constitutional.
   In another death penalty ruling, the court struck down a key
portion of North Carolina's death penalty law, invalidating the
death sentences of most of the state's 84 death row inmates.
   And in a separate decision, the court upheld a California
killer's death sentence by ruling that the instructions given to
his sentencing jury were valid.

   A key prosecution witness whose disappearance
forced a postponement in the trial of four young whites accused of
killing a black teen-ager surfaced later in the day in Ohio after
three months on the run.
   John S. Vento turned himself in Monday night to FBI agents in
Dayton, Ohio.
   Vento is a witness in the slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, 16, who was
surrounded by a gang of about 30 whites and shot Aug. 23 after he
and three friends, all black, went to Brooklyn's Bensonhurst
neighborhood to look at a used car.
   Earlier Monday, the judge in the case reluctantly agreed to
delay the trial one month to give prosecutors time to find Vento,
who had vanished in December. The FBI last week issued an arrest
warrant for him as a material witness.
   ``He walked up to the door, came in and identified himself,''
said Bob Siller, the senior FBI agent in Dayton. ``He was alone and
unarmed and surrendered without incident.''
   The prosecution will have Vento ready to testify at the April 2
trial ordered by Judge Thaddeus Owens, said Pat Clark, a spokesman
for the Brooklyn district attorney.
   The slaying inflamed racial tensions in the city. For several
days after the slaying, hundreds of blacks marched in Bensonhurst
to protest the killing.
   Seven young men were charged in the attack. The remaining
defendants are to be tried later. Joseph Fama, 19, accused of
firing the fatal shot, is in custody; the other defendants are free
on bail.

<HEAD>Judge Takes Stand, Denies Charges In Racketeering Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge accused of using his office
to do favors for convicted felons testified that he called another
judge to ask to be a character witness in a case, not to sway the
judge's decision.
   In his first day on the stand Monday, U.S. District Judge Robert
Aguilar contradicted numerous prosecution witnesses _ and in one
case, apparently his own previous tape-recorded conversation _ in
fighting charges that could cost him his career and his freedom.
   He said he was unaware that his former legal secretary, Vera
Hoff, was a fugitive from a tax evasion sentence when he visited
her in Mexico in 1981 and 1982, or when he told deputy marshals in
1980 that he did not know her address.
   He also denied knowing about a wiretap that he is accused of
twice disclosing to its target, Abe Chapman, a co-defendant in the
case and a former relative of Aguilar by marriage. Aguilar appeared
to acknowledge knowing about a Chapman wiretap in a conversation
that was secretly tape-recorded and played for the jury last week.
   Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, is charged with eight felonies,
punishable by 55 years in prison and $2 million in fines. He also
could be removed from office by Congress, regardless of the verdict.
   Accusations that he tried to influence two fellow judges, aided
a fugitive and devised a coverup are combined in a charge that he
used his office as a ``racketeering enterprise'' to obstruct
justice. It is the first such charge against a federal judge.
   Aguilar testified Monday that he intended nothing improper in
January 1987 when he phoned U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti about
the case of Ronald Cloud, Aguilar's longtime friend and former law
client. Cloud, a former Nevada casino owner, was later convicted of
bank fraud in a jury trial before Conti.
   Aguilar said his only purpose was ``to ask him if he had any
objection to my testifying in his court as a character witness.''
He said he began by telling Conti that Cloud was ``a very sick man,
a very old man, and he's a friend of mine,'' and was about to ask
about appearing as a witness when Conti changed the subject.
   He also said he ``did not think it was improper'' when he later
wrote down several suggestions to pass along to Cloud's lawyer for
his appeal.
   The prosecution contended Aguilar was trying to use his
influence with Conti to aid Cloud's case, and showed his intention
by trying to aid Cloud's appeal.

<TEXT>
   Rock singer Ozzy Osbourne, who's been known to
bite the heads off bats and pigeons, chose to send a telegram when
faced with a righteous cardinal.
   ``You are ignorant about the true meaning of my songs,''
Osbourne wrote Monday to Cardinal John J. O'Connor, who in a sermon
singled out the heavy-metal musician as especially satanic.
   ``You have also insulted the intelligence of rock fans all over
the world, and I recommend you do a little research before making
your opinions in the future,'' Osbourne said.
   The former lead singer of Black Sabbath took offense when
O'Connor singled out Osbourne's ``Suicide Solution'' as typifying
the songs that lead to demonic possession and even suicide.
   ``If you want to discuss this matter with me personally, you can
call me any time and I will only be too happy to discuss this with
you in private. God bless you,'' Osbourne wrote.
   Osbourne was sued in 1987 by parents of a 19-year-old who
committed suicide while listening to another Osbourne song. The
lawsuit was later dismissed.
   The thrash rocker says that ``Suicide Solution'' was really
about the dangers of alcohol, which caused the death of his friend,
Bon Scott, lead singer of AC-DC.
   The song, Osbourne told The Associated Press in 1987, ``was
nothing more than a warning to people on the dangers of drinking
too much alcohol. ... The song was a warning to me as well as
everyone else. If I hear it enough maybe it will have an effect.''
   Osbourne acknowledges he still has a drinking problem.

   A man who allegedly sent 212 mostly
threatening letters and cards to ``Remington Steele'' star
Stephanie Zimbalist was arrested at a hotel after he arrived in
Southern California, the FBI said.
   Michael Lawrence Shields, 43, of Plymouth, Mich., was scheduled
to appear at a bail hearing today on three counts of mailing
threatening communications contained in an FBI complaint. He was
arrested Friday.
   Most of the letters sent to the 33-year-old actress were
threatening, authorities said Monday.
   ``In your efforts to avoid me, Miss Zimbalist, you'll win a
few,'' said an April letter. ``You'll perform in some small town,
and I won't know about it. But you must win every time! I only have
to win once, and I've got you again.''
   A Feb. 16, 1990, letter reads, ``Dear Stephanie, You can run but
you can't hide. Your Secret Admirer.''
   FBI agents found Shields because his last letter said he would
be coming to Southern California and gave his flight number and the
name of the hotel, said FBI agent Lawrence Lawler.
   Philip Minges, a spokesman for the actress, said she was
``obviously relieved'' that Shields was in custody.
   Miss Zimbalist played sleuth Laura Holt on NBC's ``Remington
Steele'' TV detective series which ran from 1982 through 1986.
   U.S. Magistrate Joseph Reichmann refused Monday to throw out the
complaint. Shields' lawyer contended the letters contained no
explicit threats.

<HEAD>Human Testing of Potential AIDS Vaccine to Begin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human testing of a potential AIDS
vaccine, the first to be approved by a state board without going
through the federal process, is scheduled to begin soon at two
California hospitals.
   The California Department of Health Services Food and Drug
Branch announced Monday that clinical tests of HGP-30 will start in
two or three months at San Francisco General Hospital and the
University of Southern Califorer in Los Angeles.
Researchers are seeking 24 healthy volunteers who test negative for
exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes
AIDS.
   This initial test is to nia Medical Centdetermine the vaccine's safety.
But
scientists also will watch to see if the volunteers' bodies make
protective antibodies against the vaccine, a hint that it might
someday provide protection against acquired immune deficiency
syndrome.
   ``It is a very limited, small study _ the first step in vaccine
development in humans,'' said Dr. James Kahn, who will conduct the
testing in San Francisco. ``It's not something that's going to cure
AIDS, and it is not intended as a cure or treatment for AIDS.''
   If it is proven safe, the next step would be to see if it can
prevent AIDS, and researchers say that only after safety and
effectiveness are proven, a process that could take many years,
would the vaccine be distributp. of
Alexandria, Va.
   Researchers hope the body, when exposed to the synthetic
protein, will be tricked into thinking it has been exposed to the
true HIV protein and will launch an immune response against it.
   ``Once successful immunization with HGP-30 is achieved, an
individual should be protected from all the various strains of the
AIDS virus,'' said Dr. Allan L. Goldstein of the George Washington
University School of Medicine, who led the team that discovered
HGP-30.
   Its manufacturer became impatient with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval process and began giving the vaccine to
British men last May. No results are yet available from this study.
   Under a new state law, a drug or vaccine can be tested in
California if it is made and approved in the state. This law was
designed to circumvent the lengthy FDA approval process, speeding
up availability of anti-AIDS agents.
   By the end of last month, the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had recorded 121,645 cases of AIDS in the United
States, with 72,580 deaths, or 60 percent of all cases.

   A state legislator said turnout today
holds the key to whether he survives a recall election forced by
opponents of spearfishing rights for Wisconsin's Chippewa Indians.
   Rep. James Holperin, a four-term Democrat, is Wisconsin's first
state legislator to face a recall since 1932.
   He was challenged by Sayner businessman Gene Ahlborn in today's
Democratic race. The winner meets Republican Brian Sherren in the
April 3 election for Holperin's Assembly seat.
   ``The turnout will be critical,'' Holperin said Monday. ``The
turnout in special elections have generally not been that good. If
turnout is low, I believe I will not do as well and will be
beaten.''
   The polls opened at 8 a.m. and Oneida County Clerk Dick
MacDonald said today that clerks are expecting a big turnout
because of the controversy.
   The vote to remove the 39-year-old legislator comes after years
of turmoil over the Chippewas' rights to catch walleye with spears
in northern Wisconsin.
   In 1983, a federal court ruled the Chippewas had the right to
spearfish, hunt, cut timber and gather food off the reservation
under 19th century treaties that ceded northern Wisconsin to the
U.S. government. The ruling is under appeal.
   Vilas and Oneida counties, which Holperin represents, have been
the scene of angry confrontations between non-Indians and Chippewa
spearfishermen in recent years.
   Organizers of the recall claimed Holperin lost touch with his
constituents over the issue.
   Opponents were especially critical of his support for Republican
Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's negotiated plan to pay the Lac du Flambeau
Chippewa band $50 million in cash and other aid over 10 years if
they curtailed exercise of their treaty rights. Tribal members
voted down the plan last fall.
   Recall backers noted that surveys indicated 70 percent of
Holperin's constituents opposed the plan.
   Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, a group that objects to allowing
Indians to spearfish _ something non-Indians cannot do _ gathered
more than 6,000 signatures to force the recall.
   ``These people ... are crying for representation,'' said
Ahlborn, 50. ``I will listen to the people. It is just that plain
and simple.''
   Holperin repeatedly has said he does not support court rulings
that upheld the Indians' treaty rights. He said the lease
settlement was a way to defuse the confrontations while the appeals
weaved through the courts.
   ``If (Holperin) loses, it is going to be a threat to anyone who
does anything that a special interest groups disagrees with,'' said
Gary Greenland, a professor of history and political science at
nearby Nicolet College.

   Lee Atwater, chairman of the Republican
National Committee, was undergoing additional hospital tests today
as doctors tried to come up with a diagnosis for his collapse
during a speech.
   ``He is in great spirits and spent the day yesterday with family
and friends,'' said RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.
   One source, who asked not to be identified, said Atwater
received calls at the hospital from President Bush and former
Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon.
   The Republican chairman was taken by ambulance to Holy Cross
Hospital in suburban Silver Spring, Md., on Monday night for a
special exam called magnetic resonance imaging, which provides
computer analysis of internal organs and structures.
   After the test, Atwater was seen propped up on a stretcher,
chatting with family members and aides and appeared in good spirits.
   Goodman said early tests ``were not definitive.''
   Atwater, 39 and a regular exerciser, fainted as he was speaking
to a group of GOP contributors Monday morning and was rushed to
George Washington University Hospital. He remained in the hospital
overnight.
   Atwater collapsed about 10 minutes into a breakfast talk to
about 100 longtime contributors to Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, at a
Washington hotel.
   An aide to Gramm, Larry Neal, said two doctors were in the room
and both came forward immediately.
   Ms. Goodman said Atwater regained consciousness before an
ambulance arrived at the hotel, and was out only briefly. Neal said
paramedics arrived in two or three minutes.
   Atwater, who was President Bush's 1988 campaign manager,
accompanied Bush late last week to several GOP fundraising events
in California and had been in Puerto Rico over the weekend on party
business.
   Earlier this year, the chairman went on a liquid diet in hopes
of losing a few pounds. He told a reporter last week, however, that
he had given up the diet and had actually gained, rather than lost,
weight.
   Strict liquid diets have been associated with a variety of side
effects, including fainting.
   However, aides said Atwater had been off the diet for several
weeks and had not followed the regime closely when he was on it.
   Atwater exercises up to 90 minutes daily and runs several times
a week, often for six miles, aides said.

   The Afghan defense minister and
Moslem guerrillas attempted to overthrow the Kremlin-backed
government in Kabul today but failed, Kabul radio said.
Pakistan-based guerrillas and diplomats said they had reports of
widespread fighting in Kabul.
   In Moscow, official Soviet sources said the palace of President
Najib was bombed by unidentified planes, and that there was
fighting around the Defense Ministry.
   Official Kabul radio, monitored in Islamabad, said Defense
Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai had plotted with guerrilla leader
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his fighters to overthrow the government.
   But the attempted coup was crushed, it said, and Tanai had
escaped. Security forces were searching for him and his backers.
   The radio appealed to Afghans to join the military and help
capture Tanai ``dead or alive.''
   A curfew was imposed at 7 p.m. in Kabul, the radio said.
   Hekmatyar, leader of Hezb-i-Islami, one of the most
fundamentalist of the seven resistance groups based in Pakistan,
said the guerrillas were broadcasting appeals on the Afghan army's
military frequency urging soldiers to help oust Najib and his
government.
   ``Now is the time for all Afghan people to join hands, topple
this regime and finish the fighting,'' Hekmatyar said at a news
conference in Islamabad.
   Najib has been president of Afghanistan since 1986. He has made
various offers to the guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic
holy warriors, to try to end the civil war that started when his
Marxist party seized power in a 1978 coup.
   Tanai is considered a party hardliner who opposes the peace
overtures. He was implicated in a December coup attempt but never
charged.
   Guerrilla sources based in Pakistan said they had reports from
their commanders of widespread fighting in Kabul.
   ``If Kabul radio says it (the coup) has been crushed, it doesn't
mean it has,'' said a guerrilla source.
   Tanai, one of the leaders of the revolution that installed the
Soviet-backed government, has reportedly had contacts recently with
the Moslem guerrillas.
   Guerrillas in the Pakistan frontier city of Peshawar indicated
they would give the general sanctuary. ``Probably,'' said one
guerrilla source when asked if the rebels would help Tanai evade
Afghan troops.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, quoting eyewitnesses, said
``unidentified planes bombed the presidential palace,'' and that
anti-aircraft guns returned fire. Shooting also was heard in the
vicinity of the airport and near the Defense Ministry, Tass said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters earlier in a news briefing that a coup attempt possibly
was under way.
   ``There is fighting at the airport. The situation is unclear, it
may be a coup attempt,'' he said. ``We must wait for information,
we don't know who is fighting who.''
   He said it was too early to say what action the Soviet Union
would take in the event Najib was overthrown.
   Western diplomats in Islamabad also reported street fighting,
aerial bombardments by the Afghan air force, tank movement around
the Soviet Embassy and fighting around the presidential palace.
They did not know if the tanks were being moved to defend the
embassy or to attack it.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they had
received their information from numerous sources but declined to
elaborate.
   Radio Kabul said Aslam Watanjar, the country's interior
minister, will replace Tanai.
   Tanai has been involved in at least three of five known coup
attempts since Najib became president in December 1986, Afghan
sources in New Delhi said.
   The most recent was in December, when at least 100 members of
the Khalqi faction of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
were detained, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Similar
accounts were given by Kabul residents.
   Tanai, thought to be in his mid 40s, has a reputation as an
ultra hard-liner, especially when it comes to making any
concessions to the mujahedeen or modifying the stand of his party.
Although its origins are Marxist, the party under Najib has sought
to portray itself as a defender of Islam and champion of a
free-market economy.
   Tanai is a member of the party's Politburo, which currently has
14 members, according to senior party members.
   Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan in February 1989 after
10 years of waging war against rebels trying to oust successive
Soviet-backed regimes.
   Guerrilla attacks intensified after the pullout and some
observers predicted Najib's days were numbered, but the guerrillas
were unable to secure major cities. Government troops repelled
attacks on such cities as Jalalabad and Khost.
   International operators in Moscow reported that telephone lines
to Kabul were damaged.

   The Justice Department said today it will ask
the Supreme Court to review a second federal judge's ruling that a
new law making it a crime to burn the American flag is
unconstitutional.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said government
attorneys intend to appeal Monday's ruling here by U.S. District
Judge June Green.
   The Justice Department has already filed a notice of its
intention to ask the Supreme Court to review a similar ruling Feb.
21 by a federal judge in Seattle.
   Both judges struck down the Flag Protection Act of 1989 and
dismissed criminal charges against defendants accused of flag
burning. The judges said the statute violates the First Amendment's
protection of free speech.
   ``It would be our expectation the court would consolidate those
cases,'' Runkel said.
   The law provides for direct appeal of district-court rulings to
the Supreme Court. Such rulings have legal effect only in the
geographical area covered by the district court.
   The ruling Monday gave opponents of the law their second victory
in less than two weeks. But it also gives proponents of a
constitutional amendment to ban flag burning more political
ammunition for their cause.
   President Bush endorsed the amendment route to undo last year's
Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas flag-burning law,
saying he was unsure that the statute Congress passed instead would
survive court challenges.
   In Monday's decision, Green held that flag burning is a form of
political speech protected by the First Amendment. She rejected the
Justice Department's contention that the law was enacted to protect
the flag, not regulate speech.
   ``However compelling the government may see its interests, they
cannot justify restrictions on speech which shake the very
cornerstone of the First Amendment,'' the judge wrote.
   ``For in protecting the flag for those who wish to wave it in
support of these causes, but preventing the defendants from burning
it in opposition, the government has created a regulation which
cannot be justified without reference to the content of the
defendants' message,'' she wrote.
   Green dismissed flag-burning charges against Shawn D. Eichmann,
David G. Blalock and Scott W. Tyler. The three were arrested last
Oct. 30 after they set several flags on fire during a protest
outside the U.S. Capitol.
   Conviction under the law carries a one-year sentence.
   ``The right to dissent is sometimes an albatross which burdens
our society with its offensive sounds. Yet, political dissent lies
at the heart of the First Amendment's protection,'' Green wrote.
   It ``would not be needed if the persons who exercise their right
of free expression by word and action were all pleasing, lovable
persons with whom the rest of the citizens agreed,'' she said.
   ``The First Amendment, of course, makes no invidious exceptions.
It provides protection for everyone, including the defendants.''
   William Kunstler, a New York attorney who handled both the
Washington and Seattle cases for the Center for Constitutional
Rights, hailed the ruling, saying: ``We have knocked out an
offensive statute in the area of the First Amendment.''
   But Kunstler predicted that there would be a long fight over
passage of a constitutional amendment if both the Washington and
Seattle rulings are upheld by the Supreme Court.
   ``We passed phase one, we are going into phase two,'' Kunstler
said. ``If we win, we go into phase three, which is this horrible
amendment, which the president is sitting back and licking his
chops over.''

<HEAD>Soviet Union, East Germany Say No to Nato Membership for Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN IAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of the Soviet Union and East Germany
said today that NATO membership for a unified Germany is not
acceptable and proposed a staged approach for the merger of the two
countries.
   At a Kremlin meeting, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and East
German Premier Hans Modrow also urged that Poland be included in
discussions between the United States, Britain, France and the
Soviet Union on unification.
   After the meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said Gorbachev ``dismissed the idea of a united Germany remaining
in NATO.''
   ``It is clear to us that it does make a difference if a united
Germany is to be a NATO member,'' Gerasimov quoted Gorbachev as
saying.
   President Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl have said
a unified Germany should remain a full member of NATO. In talks in
Washington late last month, Kohl said a neutral unified Germany
would be ``a false solution.''
   East German spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the leaders agreed
NATO membership for a unified Germany would be ``a continuation of
the Cold War in the present era.''
   Modrow came to Moscow to discuss German unification, economic
cooperation, Polish borders, and Soviet security after East
Germany's free elections on March 18.
   He returned to Berlin this afternoon.
   Until the hard-line Communist regime of Erich Honecker crumbled
last fall, East Germany was the Soviet Union's firmest ally in
Eastern Europe, and it remains the Kremlin's chief trading partner.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev saw a bright future for trade with
unified Germany. ``He was very optimistic about our future
relations if unification proceeded as it should, that is
stage-by-stage,'' Gerasimov said.
   He said both sides wanted a meeting of the four World War II
victors _ the Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain _
before the East German elections.
   ``All countries, except the United States, have given the
go-ahead,'' Gerasimov said.
   Gorbachev and Modrow agreed Poland should be included in the
unification process, spokesmen for the leaders said.
   ``The two sides are of the opinion that not a single question
concerning Poland can be considered without it (Poland),'' Mayer
said. ``The same applies to all neighbors of East Germany and West
Germany.''
   Germany's attack on Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, started World War
II. Poland lost territory to the Soviet Union but gained land from
Germany at the war's end and Poland has asked the German states for
a treaty that guarantees the Oder-Neisse river border as the
permanent frontier.

<HEAD>``60 Minutes'' Fourth In National Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Andy Rooney back after his controversial
suspension, CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was fourth in last week's national
Nielsen ratings and had its fourth highest rating this season, CBS
estimates showed today.
   Sunday's broadcast, in which Rooney discussed his abbreviated
suspension and denied he was a bigot, had a 22 rating and a 37
percent share of the national audience, easily beating ABC's
competing ``Life Goes On.''
   That series had an 8.9 rating and a 15 percent audience share,
trailed by NBC's Disney movie hour, which averaged an 8.3 rating
and a 14 percent share. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   On Feb. 8, Rooney was suspended for three months without pay
after a gay magazine quoted him as making a racial slur. He denied
he said it. CBS News president David Burke lifted Rooney's
suspension Thursday.
   The ratings of ``60 Minutes'' slipped during Rooney's three-week
absence, and the program on Feb. 25 dropped to 18th place in
ratings.
   Network analysts said the slippage was due primarily to ABC's
repeat broadcast of the premiere of its hit ``America's Funniest
Home Videos.'' That special, shown in the time period normally held
by ``Life Goes On,'' beat ``60 Minutes'' in the ratings.

<HEAD>Perrier Begins Resupply of Sparkling Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The producers of Perrier began resupplying their
distributors today, three weeks after ordering the worldwide recall
of 160 million bottles because traces of cancer-causing chemicals
were found in the sparkling water.
   The company said the new bottles _ marked ``New Production'' _
would be available Wednesday in French stores and in most of
Europe, Canada and the eastern United States by early April. They
will be available in the western United States by April 22, Perrier
said.
   The recall was announced Feb. 14 after traces of benzene, a
cancer-causing chemical, were found in Perrier samples in several
countries, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, the
Netherlands and Denmark.
   Benzene, a naturally occurring chemical used in cleaning
solvents, entered Perrier's bottling line after workers failed to
replace a filter, the company said.
   A spokesman for Perrier said an international team of experts
would ensure that the mineral water is now pure.
   The company said it has not yet been able to calculate the cost
of the resupply program.
   In France, unlike in other countries, the recall was voluntary.
Some supermarket chains cleared their shelves of the product, while
other shopowners continued to sell it.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia's first free
elections in more than four decades will be held on June 8 and 9,
Parliament announced today.
   The balloting for both houses of Parliament will be based on the
principle of proportional representation, said a parliament
statement carried by the official CTK news agency. Parties will
need 10,000 signatures to run a candidate and at least 5 percent of
the national vote for a mandate, CTK said.
   Czechoslovakia's peaceful revolution late last year toppled the
hard-line Communist leadership of Milos Jakes, ending more than 40
years of Communist rule and paving the way for the first free
elections since 1946.
   In keeping with a decision to streamline the country's
legislative body, the number of seats in the House of People, one
of Parliament's two chambers, has been reduced from 200 to 150
seats.
   Of those, 101 will go to candidates in the Czech lands, while 49
will be allocated to deputies from the country's smaller republic,
Slovakia, CTK said.
   In the second chamber, the House of Nations, the 150 seats were
divided evenly between representatives from the two republics.
   The decision to cut the number of seats came under a move to
transform the parliament into a less unwieldy, full-time
legislature. Under Communist rule the parliament was largely a
rubber-stamp institution for party policy that met only a few days
a year.
   In another development, the Czech National Council, the regional
Parliament, approved an amendment to the republic's constitution
Monday dropping the ``Socialist,'' from its name, ``Czech
Socicalist Republic,'' CTK reported.
   The Slovak National Council passed an identical law on Friday.
   Deputies of the Czech council also supported a proposal by
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel to drop the word ``Socialist''
from the country's formal name, making it the ``Czechoslovak
Republic.''
   The Czech and Slovak lands were united in Czechoslovakia in 1918
after the dissolution of the Austrian Habsburg monarchy in World
War I. The country was named the Czechoslovak Republic from 1918
until 1960, when the Communists added the definition Socialist.

   The Israeli navy captured a senior PLO officer
and an alleged ``terrorist'' collaborator when it seized a boat off
the Lebanese coast last month, the military announced Tuesday.
   The PLO officer was identified as Said Sanouna, and was about to
be appointed to a senior post with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat's
mainstream Fatah faction in Lebanon. The second person was not
identified.
   The Farah 7, en route from Cyprus to Lebanon, was stopped by the
navy during a routine patrol Feb. 23, and it was brought to Israel,
the military said.
   The boat and all those aboard except two _ Sanouna and a
``wanted collaborator with terrorists'' _ were freed Tuesday, the
military said.
   The Farah 7 had been stopped by the navy near Lebanon in April
1989 and several Fatah men were captured, according to a military
spokesman.
   The military did not say how many people were aboard the vessel
or where it had been registered.

   A range war has erupted in northern
Nigeria for the second time in four months, claiming 11 lives,
newspapers reported Tuesday.
   Fulani cattle herders clashed with Hausa farmers in Sokoto state
last weekend, the newspapers said. The farmers accuse the herdsmen
of letting their cattle graze on the farmers' crops.
   The latest fighting followed the release from jail of two cattle
herders who had been charged with killing a farmer. Angered by the
release of the two herders, relatives of the dead farmer attacked
the ranchers, the newspapers said.
   Fighting between the farmers and ranchers claimed nine lives in
Sokoto state since November.

   Archaeologists have unearthed a pink
pearl, believed to be 4,000 years old, stirring excitement on this
Persian Gulf island whose oil riches overshadow its former glory as
the land of the pearls.
   ``This is an excellent find, the most romantic find of the
decade,'' said Robert Killick, director of the joint London-Bahrain
Archaeological Expedition.
   Unlike gold or silver trinkets, ancient pearls are extremely
rare finds because their surfaces peel and they disintegrate, he
said.
   Killick said the pearl, which was four millimeters in diameter,
was from the Dilmun era _ 45 to 50 centuries ago when the island
thrived as a major trading center between Mesopotamia, now Iraq,
and the Indus Valley of west Asia.
   Killick said the pearl was believed 4,000 years old because his
expedition, which involves Bahrain's Ministry of Information and
the British Academy, was digging through an ancient town dating to
that time.
   Bahrain's pearling industry thrived in the past three centuries,
but tapered off with the advent of Japan's artificial pearl
industry and the vast wealth earned from oil.

<TEXT>
   Four Japanese mountain climbers
attempting a winter ascent of Mount McKinley's dangerous West
Buttress haven't been seen in nearly two weeks.
   Four other climbers have died on North America's highest
mountain during winter.
   At high elevations in winter, McKinley often has white-out
conditions with wind that can exceed 200 mph. The mountain is in
Denali National Park, the native American name for the mountain.
   The climbers and their equipment, including a 35-day supply of
food, were flown to a camp on the southeast fork of the Kahiltna
Glacier on Feb. 11, said Park Service mountaineering ranger Bob
Seibert. Since then, the weather on the 20,320-foot mountain
generally has been bad.
   Cliff Hudson, a bush pilot who flew the group onto the mountain,
said he was scheduled to check on them last week. But he said he
could not because visibility on the mountain has been close to zero.
   Hudson and Seibert said the group was last seen Feb. 22 at about
the 11,000-foot level by a plane flying overhead. There were no
apparent problems.
   Hudson said he would try to fly over the mountain as soon as
weather permitted. ``They have priority,'' he said.
   When the group left Talkeetna, outside the park, they gave March
15 as the ``last due out'' date, Seibert said. That is the day a
search would begin if they don't return.
   Hiroshi Oda, 37 of Osaka, is leading the 1990 Japan Winter
McKinley Expedition. With him are Takeyoshi Takatsuka, 47, of
Toyama; Osamu Tagaya, 34, of Akita; and Junji Saito, 25, also of
Osaka.
   All four are experienced mountaineers, Seibert said.
   Oda has successfully climbed Mount Everest and McKinley's West
Buttress during summer, and Takatsuka has scaled Everest and K2,
the two highest peaks in the world, Seibert said.
   If successful, they would be the first Japanese to successfully
scale the West Buttress in winter.
   Last March, three Japanese climbers were lost in a storm on
their way up the mountain during a storm that featured 200-plus mph
wind. A fourth member of that group returned to camp alone before
his fellow climbers were lost.
   In 1984, solo adventurer Naomi Uemura died on his way down the
mountain after planting his flag at the top. It is believed he also
died in a winter storm, Seibert said.

   Nearly 4,000 feet of film on Albert
Einstein that was part of the University of South Carolina's
Movietonews collection fell out of a delivery truck and has been
missing for a week, officials say.
   ``From a historical standpoint, it is absolutely
irreplaceable,'' said Don McCallister, assistant archivist for the
university's News Film Library. ``I can't really put a dollar value
on it. How do you put a dollar value on something that cannot be
replaced?''
   The film, which has historical value to researchers, shows
Einstein appearing at various events during the 1930s.
   The university was sending the film, which was packed in a
1-foot-square fiberboard carton, to Audio Plus Video International
in Northvale, N.J., so it could be copied onto videotape for a
French filmmaker, McCallister said.
   On Feb. 27, a delivery truck carrying the film left the Federal
Express office in Columbia. A few blocks down the road, the driver
realized the back door had opened.
   Federal Express workers searched the route but did not find the
package.
   ``We are doing everything we can to try to find this package,''
Sandra Munoz, a spokeswoman for Federal Express in Memphis, Tenn.,
said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   The SR-71 Blackbird spy plane ended its
last flight today, apparently shattering at least three air-speed
standards as it crossed the continent on its way to museum display.
Initial calculations put its flight time at 68 minutes and 32
seconds.
   The aircraft, to be displayed by the Smithsonian Institution,
touched down at Washington Dulles International Airport at 10:50
a.m. EST, said Jack Weir of the airport operations office.
   The aircraft had taken off in a fiery blast from its Mojave
Desert airfield at Air Force Plant 42 at 4:30 a.m. PST, or 7:30
a.m. EST. After flying over California for a time, it took on fuel
before officially beginning its flight, and landed at the airport
some 20 miles outside Washington, D.C.
   Weir said officials were still determining whether the spy
plane, which is being mothballed because of budget cuts, broke four
records as intended. ``They're still computing all that,'' said
Weir just after the landing.
   ``Unofficially, it set at least three records,'' Weir said. One
was fastest transcontinental flight, he said. It was not
immediately known what the other two were. Weir said the flight
time was initially determined to be 68 minutes, 32 seconds.
   ``It was awesome,'' said Air Force Col. Tom Hornung of the
liftoff. ``It was a fitting end to a great Air Force program.''
   Flying the ominous-looking black plane were pilot Lt. Col.
Raymond E. Yeilding and his reconnaissance systems officer, Lt.
Col. J. D. Vida.
   At speeds exceeding Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound,
the crew planned to attempt four speed records on the way.
   The crew was trying to best a world record from Los Angeles to
Washington, a world record from Kansas City to Washington, a world
record from St. Louis to Cincinnati and a national record from the
West Coast to the East Coast. Any records must be certified by the
Federation Aeronautique International.
   The Blackbird spy plane was a successor aircraft to the U-2 spy
plane, one of which was shot down on a spying mission over the
Soviet Union during the Eisenhower administration.
   The Blackbird, the world's fastest operational aircraft, has
never been shot down, although it has collected virtually tons of
raw intelligence data from world hot spots during its 25-year
service life.
   Pilots flying SR-71s already hold the world absolute records for
speed, 2,193 mph, and altitude, 85,069 feet.
   After congressional debate late last year, Congress decided to
go along with an Air Force request to mothball the Blackbird fleet.
The Air Force contended that the program was too expensive compared
to other budget priorities, such as the B-2 stealth bomber. It also
hopes to develop a new generation of fighter aircraft for the 21st
century.
   The Blackbird planes remained popular with congressional
intelligence committees and with other consumers of intelligence
such as the CIA and the State Department. The spy plane program has
been carried as part of the Air Force budget.

<HEAD>7,000 U.S. Troops May be Withdrawn from South Korea</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials said Tuesday they are
considering withdrawing 7,000 troops from South Korea by 1994, a
number that would reduce U.S. forces on the peninsula to the lowest
level since the Korean War.
   Also on Tuesday, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo warned North
Korea that the discovery of what Seoul officials describe as an
invasion tunnel across the 2{-mile Demilitarized Zone could lead to
the communist nation's ``self-destruction.''
   A reduction of 7,000 troops would leave roughly 36,000 U.S.
servicemen in South Korea. It was reported earlier that the United
States would be withdrawing about 5,000 troops.
   In the new proposal, about 2,000 air support personnel and 5,000
other troops would be evacuated, officials said. It has not been
decided whether units of the 2nd Infantry Division, key U.S. ground
troops deployed near the border, would be affected, they said.
   As part of a series of defense reductions Washington has asked
Seoul to increase the money it pays toward the upkeep of U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea, officials said.
   Other changes being considered could include the appointment of
a Korean to replace an American admiral as head of the United
Nations Command delegation to the Military Armistice Commission.
The U.S.-led command represents the 16 nations that fought
alongside South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War and help police
the armistice that ended the conflict.
   The 155-mile border separating North Korea from South Korea is
one of the most heavily fortified in the world and is sealed to
prevent communication, visits, mail or telephone calls from one
side to the other.
   Despite sporatic dialogue aimed at easing tensions, the two
nations remain enemies. The sweeping changes that have created new
political allignments in Eastern Europe show no sign of affecting
North Korea, one of the last hard-line communist states.
   The tunnel discovered Saturday was found 145 yards below the
surface, and is 2 yards wide and 2 yards high, large enough for
three fully armed soldiers to run abreast, officials said. They
said a regiment-size army could pass through in an hour.
   ``The North Korean leaders must know that they could face a
self-destructive, suicidal situation if they continue such
anti-national acts,'' Roh said in a speech at the Korea Military
Academy.
   Officials said the tunnel, which begins in the northern sector
of the neutral zone, crosses about 1,000 yards into South Korean
territory.

   A woman who told a judge, ``I will not
go to jail,'' swallowed a handful of pills as she was led away, and
was hospitalized Tuesday in critical condition.
   Carol Krzyzaniak of Spring Hill was in court Monday under orders
to come up with $2,000 or spend 179 days in jail in a guardianship
mismanagement case, said Circuit Judge Richard Tombrink Jr.
   When she said she could not pay and was led off to jail, she
started taking the pills.
   ``She took a large number of pills. But I don't know what
kind,'' said Tim Mossgrove of the city fire-rescue department,
which took her to Lykes Memorial Hospital, where she was in
intensive care.
   Ms. Krzyzaniak was found in contempt of court Jan. 25 for
failing to uphold her duties as legal guardian of the $130,000
estate of an 84-year-old man who died in June.
   Brooksville is in Hernando County, about 50 miles north of Tampa.

   Generations of tires have rolled along
the two-mile strip of McHenry Avenue where cruising has resisted
fading into nostalgia with sock hops, 45 rpm records and poodle
skirts.
   It was a world shown in the reminiscences of native son George
Lucas in his 1973 movie ``American Graffiti.''
   But like rock 'n' roll, cruising has evolved into something
wilder, argue police and some business owners who want to curb the
steady parade of teen-agers and cars.
   ``When people cruise McHenry, we see an increase in gang
activity, in alcohol and substance abuse, vandalism to businesses
and disrespect in the neighborhoods,'' said Mayor Carol Whiteside.
``We're not willing to be a magnet for everyone in northern
California who doesn't have anywhere else to go on Friday night.''
   Business owners, tired of removing trash and graffiti from their
property before opening Monday mornings, and police, concerned they
can't adequately patrol the car-clogged avenue, are pushing a pair
of anti-cruising ordinances to be considered March 27 by City
Council.
   Under the proposals, motorists would face fines if they pass
designated checkpoints more than twice in a four-hour period.
Pedestrians would risk loitering citations.
   Modestans may deny that cruising is a source of identity for the
central California city dwarfed by the San Francisco Bay area 90
miles to the west. But it's hard to find business owners or
customers along McHenry Avenue who didn't at some time cruise along
some thoroughfare.
   Perhaps it's the legacy of ``American Graffiti,'' along with the
annual Graffiti Night, which honors the cruising tradition in grand
proportions, that draws teen-agers to McHenry Avenue most Friday
and Saturday nights, sometimes 5,000 vehicles strong.
   ``We're not here to look for trouble. We're here to have a good
time. This is what gathers all different people,'' said 17-year-old
Robert Bennett, who drove 15 miles from Manteca.
   ``A lot of people do bring cars for show,'' said his companion,
Matt Meza, 19.
   Joe Hudson, 19, drove 30 miles from Tracy to find a group of
girls he'd met the week before. Not that the evening would be lost
if they didn't show _ ``There goes a Mustang with a blonde and a
brunette,'' he pointed out to two friends.
   Today's cruisers may have the same motives as their parents and
grandparents, but as car clubs give way to gangs, pranks to
violence and staticky radios to blaring stereo systems, some
residents wonder if it's time to let cruising pass into legend.
   ``Modesto is maturing. There is nothing wrong with cruising, but
it's not a part of the way of life anymore,'' said Kyle Barker, a
music store owner. ``I think we accepted it 10 years ago, one,
because I think it was more wholesome and, two, I think we were
more naive about the consequences.''
   In Lucas' day, a well-aimed water balloon may have gotten the
perpetrator's windshield smeared with shaving cream, but probably
wouldn't have drawn a knuckle sandwich.
   The consequences today may be far more serious, said police Sgt.
Gene Wilkinson.
   ``We may get somebody beat over the head with a baseball bat
because he hit someone with a water balloon,'' he said.
   Now, during a typical weekend along McHenry Avenue, 50-odd
citations are issued and half dozen arrests are made, Wilkinson
said.
   ``It's a different world than you had 25 or 30 years ago. We
have to address the problems of today,'' Wilkinson said.
   ``I can understand the complaints of nostalgia buffs. Maybe 30
years ago, it would have been an overreaction, but today all we're
trying to do is protect those we can.''
   McHenry Avenue today is the address of hundreds of businesses,
and some owners say they lose customers when the daytime commuter
corridor becomes overrun by low riders with rattling mufflers,
detailed pickup trucks and pastel colored VWs.
   ``Commerce is America. We have to earn a living. If it's in our
way, we have to stop it,'' said Raj Jariya, night clerk at the
Capri Inn.

   There are now a quarter-billion Americans.
   This nation started life with just under 4 million people, about
as many as now live in metropolitan Boston.
   On Tuesday it reached 250,000,000, according to estimates by the
Census Bureau.
   A more detailed total will be calculated following the national
head count to be taken April 1.
   The 250 million estimate represents a 10.4 percent increase from
the 226.5 million Americans counted in 1980.
   The U.S. population reached 50 million in 1880, doubled to 100
million by 1915, was 150 million in 1949 and climbed to the 200
million mark in 1967.
   Projections done by the Census Bureau indicate that the nation
could reach 300 million within 30 years.
   Current population growth is estimated at one new person every
14 seconds in the United States. That is based on a birth every 8
seconds and a new immigrant arriving every 35 seconds, balanced by
a death every 14 seconds and a departure every 3 minutes.
   The United States ranks fourth in the world in population,
following China, at 1.1 billion; India, at 833 million, and the
Soviet Union, at 289 million.
   Following the United States are Indonesia, 188 million; Brazil,
151 million; Japan, 123 million; Nigeria, 115 million; Bangladesh,
115 million and Pakistan, 110 million.

   Two more unlike months you could hardly find
in a single season. It was the warmest January on record in the
United States, following one of the coldest Decembers.
   The average temperature in January was 37.2 degrees Fahranheit
in the 48 contiguous states, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported Monday.
   That's the warmest January since uniform record collection was
started in 1895, according to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center
in Asheville, N.C.
   The relative warmth was felt most strongly in the region that
includes parts of Montana, the Dakotas, Wyoming and Nebraska, the
agency said. But readings were above normal across nearly all of
the nation Mx}ept the Southwest.
   That warmth came hard on the heels of the fourth coldest
December on record, a month when bitter cold was felt even in
Florida, the agency noted.

<HEAD>Billboards Will Tell Youths ``Addiction is Slavery''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black hand grips several vials of crack
cocaine. The message is simple _ ``Addiction is slavery.''
   The billboard, unveiled Tuesday by NAACP Executive Director
Benjamin L. Hooks, will soon appear in several thousand locations
nationwide, as will a companion anti-drug billboard aimed at white
youths.
   ``If anything today is slavery, it is drug addiction,'' Hooks
said. ``It determines when you wake up, when you go to bed, what
kind of job you have, what you think, what you do.
   ``It destroys lives, will, and purpose and nothing has been
deadlier, more dangerous, more damaging to this America than the
addiction to illegal substances,'' he said.
   The Outdoor Advertising Association of America is donating the
5,000 billboards in conjunction with the Partnership for a
Drug-Free America. The Eight-Sheet Outdoor Advertising Association,
which represents smaller billboards found mainly in urban areas, is
working with the OAAA on the anti-drug effort.
   ``I hope that it will help to wipe out the drug scourge in
America, and that young men and women can lift up their heads,
their eyes, their hearts and be able to walk down the street
knowing they are not slaves but that they are in control and in
charge of their lives,'' Hooks said.
   The ``Addiction is Slavery'' billboard targets the black
community. A companion billboard called ``cocaine gun'' shows a
young white boy with a gun pointed up his nose and is labeled
simply, ``Cocaine.''
   The ``Addiction is Slavery'' billboard was created by the
Harlem-based Patrick Agency and the ``Cocaine Gun'' billboard was
created by DDB Needham Worldwide.
   Kippy Burns, a spokeswoman for the Outdoor Advertising
Association of America, said the number of billboards being devoted
to the message has not been determined.
   The OAAA, which represents more than 80 percent of the billboard
industry, estimates the value of the advertising effort at $5
million, Burns said.

<HEAD>U.S. Jews Hope to Raise $420 Million to Resettle Soviets in Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Jews intend to raise $420 million
this year for ``Operation Exodus'' to help settle a flood of Soviet
Jews in Israel, fund-raisers announced Tuesday.
   The money will be used to transport immigrants from the Soviet
Union, to refurbuish absorption centers in Israel and to help in
the initial costs of the resettlement.
   The campaign, begun last week, is the largest special
fund-raising drive undertaken by the United Jewish Appeal, which
raises money for Israel and for Jewish communities in the United
States and elsewhere, said spokesman Raphael Rothstein.
   So far, more than $60 million have been pledged by wealthy
Jewish donors, he said at a news conference. The rest of the money
is expected to be pledged this year but contributors will have
three years to pay up, he said.
   Soviet reforms have opened the doors to an unprecedented wave of
Jewish emigration, most of it heading for Israel. In the first 15
days of February, some 4,600 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel _ more
than twice the number that came to Israel in all of 1988, the
appeal said.
   The Jews' departure has been speeded by fears of escalating
anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union. ``There's an urgency that may
become an emergency,'' Rothstein said.
   But the pace of emigration has been slowed by the Kremlin's
refusal to implement an agreement for direct flights from Moscow to
Tel Aviv. Rothstein said Jewish leaders are not hopeful that direct
flights will be allowed any time soon because of intense pressure
from the Arab world, which opposes the Jewish immigration to Israel.
   He said discussions were underway for ships to carry some of the
emigres from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Israel. Such a journey
would last 2{ days and would augment the flights from Bucharest,
Budapest and other transit points now used by Soviet Jews to reach
Israel.
   The fund raising is based on projections that 200,000 Soviet
Jews will arrive in Israel in the next few years, although Israeli
officials say the figures could fluctuate with changing
circumstances.
   The Israeli government will provide $3 billion for the
absorption of the immigrants, with the rest to be raised by world
Jewry.
   Israel has also asked the Bush administration to guarantee $400
million to build housing for the immigrants. The administration has
said it would support the guarantees if Israel promised not to use
the money for housing in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel has declined to provide such an outright pledge.
   The disagreement has raised tensions between Washington and
Israel, already exacerbated by Israeli stalling on a proposal by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for advancing peace talks
with Palestinians from the occupied territories.
   Rothstein said the political conflict has not spilled over into
the fund-raising campaign. ``There is no indication that political
considerations will affect people's generosity,'' he said.

   Official election returns trickling in Tuesday
appeared to bear out pro-democracy movements' claims of widespread
victories in the country's Slavic heartland, but they also showed
Soviet officialdom winning several key races.
   Communist Party and government officials who won seats in
Sunday's local elections included the Ukraine's prime minister,
Vitaly Masol, several chiefs of the Ukraine's Communist Party, and
the president and prime minister of Byelorussia, the state-run news
agency Tass reported.
   Among prominent pro-reform candidates named as winners by the
official press Tuesday were Tatyana Koryagina, a radical economist
who has warned of a conservative conspiracy against reform, and
Victor Shinkaretsky, a crusading consumer reporter on Soviet TV.
   The vast majority of the 1,800 parliament seats up for grabs in
the Ukraine, Byelorussia and the Russian republic parliaments must
be decided in run-off elections. Candidates were required to win 50
percent of the vote.
   Almost 450 out of 497 races for local councils will go to
run-off elections in Moscow, 330 out of 450 districts in the
Ukraine; and 43 out of 48 districts in the Byelorussian capital of
Minsk, Soviet media reported.
   The run-off elections are expected within two weeks.
   Activists from the Ukraine's Narodny Rukh, Byelorussian People's
Front and various other progressive movements have said strong
showings in this round nearly guaranteed victories in run-off
elections for candidates who want to step up the pace of reforms
begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has railed against functionaries who hamper reform,
and people hoping to exercise new economic freedoms have told of
crippling obstacles erected by local party officials.
   Deputies elected in Byelorussia included an unusually high
number of doctors, particularly in areas affected by radiation from
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, Tass said.
   Voter turnout was as high as 80 percent in the Ukraine and
Byelorussia, but only 64 percent of registered voters turned out in
Moscow, the newspaper Pravda said Tuesday.
   Byelorussia, the Ukraine and the vast Russian republic account
for 80 percent of the Soviet Union and more than two-thirds of its
290 million people.

   Firefighters on Tuesday finally
extinguished a blaze aboard the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Surf
City after a 12-day battle, the owners said.
   The vessel, in the Gulf of Oman 100 miles off Fujairah, will be
left to cool for 24 hours before being removed, according to a
statement issued by Chesapeake Shipping Inc. in the United Arab
Emirates port city of Dubai.
   A Feb. 22 blast and fire aboard the 81,283-ton oil products
tanker killed two of the 25-member U.S. crew. Four suffered
injuries.
   The Surf City was one of 11 tankers Kuwait registered in the
United States during the Iraq-Iran war to entitle them to U.S. Navy
protection.
   Kuwaiti officials, who established the U.S.-registered
Chesapeake company to operate the reflagged vessels, said an
electrical short circuit caused the explosion.
   The vessel will be towed to a safe position to conduct a
ship-to-ship transfer of the remaining cargo, the company said.
Eighty percent of the original gas-oil cargo and 60 percent of the
original naphtha cargo remained intact, it said.
   The blast, which occurred off the U.A.E. southern emirate of
Sharjah, started a fire that gutted the living quarters of the
700-foot vessel.
   A fleet of tugboats fought the fire, which repeatedly reignited.
The ship was towed from the gulf after four days because Sharjah
authorities feared new explosions.

<TEXT>
   The Senate today confirmed conservative civil
rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge,
brushing aside complaints about his record from some liberal and
senior citizens groups.
   The Senate had planned to take a roll call on the nomination but
changed course at the last minute and confirmed Thomas on a voice
vote.
   Thomas, 41, will be a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in the District of Columbia.
   As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over
the last eight years, he has been one of the most visible black
officials in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Thomas, a critic of quotas and affirmative action to fight
hiring discrimination, has been highly praised by conservatives.
But liberals have criticized his record.
   It became clear Monday night that Thomas' critics had failed to
muster enough support to defeat his nomination.
   ``I am prepared to concede that Mr. Thomas is going to be
confirmed,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a leading
critic.
   The only other opponent to materialize in the debate was Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging, who complained that the statute of limitations on 15,000
age-discrimination cases before the EEOC ran out without any action
being taken while Thomas was in charge.
   ``Those cases might as well have been sent to Beijing,'' Pryor
said. ``They might as well have been sent to Bulgaria. They might
as well have been sent to Romania. ... It's too much to overlook.''
   Pryor said, however, that Thomas was virtually guaranteed to win
confirmation and added that he wished the nominee well in his new
post.
   Danforth, Thomas' chief Senate supporter and former employer,
said he could vouch for the nominee's abilities as a lawyer.
   ``I hired him twice,'' Danforth said. ``People say, 'Don't you
ever make a mistake?' Well, yeah, but not twice.''
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., dismissed complaints that Thomas had
failed to cooperate with the Aging Committee several years ago when
former Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont., was chairman.
   Simpson said the panel's investigation of the employment
commission was flawed to begin with.
   ``They wasted a lot of time trying to nail Clarence Thomas,'' he
said.
   Thomas was born in poverty in rural Georgia, worked his way
through college and is a graduate of Yale Law School. Before
becoming chairman of the commission, he worked under Danforth in
the Missouri attorney general's office and in the Senate as well
for the Monsanto Corp.
   Civil rights forces have been divided over the nomination. The
Alliance for Justice, a liberal court-watcher group based in
Washington, and several senior citizens groups have been critical.
But the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
did not take a stand on the issue.

   President Bush welcomed Italian Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti to the White House today for discussions on giving
Italy a larger role in shaping a reunified Germany.
   ``We agree on the foundations of a new Europe,'' Bush said in a
speech on the South Lawn welcoming Andreotti to the White House.
The president stressed the ties between the United States and
Italy, to which 12 million Americans trace their descent.
   ``Our dialogue is constant, it is substantive, it is
productive,'' Bush said.
   Responding, Andreotti said Italy welcomed ``the dawn of
democracy'' in Eastern Europe. But without elaboration, he said the
new world that is emerging was ``fraught with problems'' and
challenges.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced
later that the United States has accepted a West German proposal
for ``a two-plus-four meeting of sub-Cabinet officials on March 14
in Bonn.'' Fitzwater said the officials would ``discuss the
procedures for future substantive meetings'' on German unification.
   The two-plus-four are the two Germanys and the four powers that
defeated Nazi Germany in World War II, the United States, Great
Britain, France and the Soviet Union. Fitzwater said later meetings
will be held only after the March 18 elections in East Germany and
after discussions between the two Germanys themselves.
   The State Department said the two-plus-four formula would not be
expanded to give a seat at the table to Italy, Poland or any of the
other smaller countries.
   Spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said the formula ``is designed
with the four because the four have special legal rights and
responsibilities since World War II. ... We have said as far as the
others, that we have definitely and are aware of all of their
concerns, and will listen to their concerns.''
   Andreotti technically speaks only for Italy as he asks Bush to
guarantee Rome a place in the U.S. formula for merging East Germany
with West Germany.
   But Denmark, Norway, and other small countries _ as well as
Poland and other victims of German aggression in Eastern Europe in
World War II _ have a stake in the outcome of Andreotti's talks
with Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   ``It's not a problem which belongs to Italy,'' Andreotti said as
he opened talks with Bush in the Oval Office. ``I think that all
the member countries of the Atlantic alliance must handle together
these problems,'' he said.
   Andreotti made an exception only of Berlin, the former German
capital which is under the control of the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain and France. ``The specific problems related to
Berlin must be handled by the four countries,'' he said.
   He stressed that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the
16-member alliance between the United States, Canada and 14
European countries, and the European Security Conference, a
grouping of 35 East, West and neutral nations, should be updated to
deal with changing circumstances.
   ``The Western alliance is ever more vital and necessary,''
Andreotti said.
   The ``two plus four'' formula would have the two Germanys make
most of the basic arrangements for unification. Afterward, the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _ the Big Four
allies of World War II _ would move into the planning to consider
security issues and the new Germany's place in Europe.
   Baker gained Soviet, British and French acceptance of the
approach at an ``Open Skies'' conference last month in Ottawa,
Canada. Last week, visiting Irish Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey
worked out an agreement with Bush for additional consultations with
the 12 nations of the European Community.
   Still, Andreotti, who heads Italy's 49th postwar government and
is in his sixth non-consecutive term as prime minister, is uneasy.
   Last week in Rome, he called for closer cooperation between
Europe and North America and urged Washington not to overlook its
allies in negotiating German unification and other important
political and security issues.
   Andreotti was quoted as saying that any breakdown in the
U.S.-Western European relationship at the close of the Cold War
would be ``truly absurd.''
   The prime minister said he did not fear a united Germany would
turn belligerent. But he registered concern that interest rates
could be driven up when West Germany tries to help East German
development.
   A senior U.S. official, in a White House session Monday with
reporters, said: ``From our perspective, Italy is a very key player
in European events. We have made clear that while we think the `two
plus four' mechanism is a very important mechanism, it is only a
first step, a step in this larger process of German unification.''
   The official, whose name could not be disclosed under rules of
the briefing, added: ``We believe that there should be full
alliance consultation on this process. And there should be full
involvement of all European nations concerned. And that, of course,
includes Italy.''
   At another point, the official described Italy as ``a very key
ally'' and said ``we attach a lot of importance to these regular
consultations.''
   After the meeting with Bush and lunch with Baker at the State
Department, Andreottiplanned separate sessions with U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady. He will be guest at a black-tie
dinner tonight at the White House.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Shelves Resolutions on German Border, Unification</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee on Tuesday shelved a resolution that would have called on
Germany to stick to its present borders, saying the rush of events
made the proposal unnecessary.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., withdrew his resolution after West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government indicated in Bonn it
would not lay claim to Polish land.
   ``I believe international pressure, including the pressure
generated by prospective action on my resolution, contributed to
Chancellor Kohl's decision to provide the necesary assurances on
the Polish-German border,'' Pell said at a committee hearing.
   Kohl's government agreed to introduce a resolution in Parliament
saying that a united Germany should sign a treaty promising it will
never seek to recover Polish land lost after the 1945 defeat of the
Third Reich.
   The Senate panel also postponed action on a separate resolution
that would have called for the leaders of Poland and Czechoslovakia
to be included in talks about German reunification.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said it would be premature to vote
on the measure before a group of senators had a first-hand look at
the tumultuous German situation.
   Lugar and members of an arms control observer group will travel
next week to East and West Germany and meet with Kohl.
   But Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who with Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md., introduced the second resolution, pushed unsuccessfully for
a vote. ``It's simply saying let's consult,'' he said.
   ``In fact, we are sending the wrong signal by objecting,'' said
Simon.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., sided with Lugar, saying the Senate
shouldn't be dabbling in ``things that we don't know anything
about.''
   Simon said he assumed Lugar was acting on behalf of the Bush
administration in holding up a vote on the measure. An aide to
Lugar, speaking on condition he not be identified, said State
Department officials told Lugar late Monday they hadn't studied the
resolution closely enough to have a final opinion.

   One musher in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race and his dogs were safe today after he had to kill an attacking
moose with five pistol shots.
   Defending champion Joe Runyan held the lead today after passing
four-time winner Rick Swenson in the 1,160-mile race.
   Lorren Weaver, holding 44th place among the 68 racers still in
the race and 78 miles behind Runyan, killed a moose that attacked
his dogs on the trail between Skwentna and Finger Lake, race
officials said.
   Searchers had set out on snowmobiles Monday after two bush
pilots reported seeing the moose attack a team of dogs.
   One dog was gashed across the head, but Weaver, 50, a physician
fron Knik, and his team were otherwise unhurt. They continued into
Finger Lake, checkpoint No. 7 and 193 miles from the start of the
race from Anchorage to Nome that started Saturday.
   Race spokeswoman Debbie Croutch said the moose was without
antlers, but there was no report on whether it was a bull or a cow.
Bulls often have dropped their racks this by time of year.
   Attacks by hungry moose plagued racers during training this
year, and some mushers carried rifles for protection. The animals,
which weigh up to 1,800 pounds, have become aggressive because deep
snow has made it hard to graze.
   Runyan and five other veteran racers overtook Swenson during the
sprint Monday from Rainy Pass to Rohn, 271 miles into the race. The
group passing Swenson included his archrival, Susan Butcher.
   Swenson is the only person to have won the race four times.
Butcher won in 1986, 1987 and 1988, and took second place last year.
   The Iditarod race runs from Anchorage to Nome, on the Bering Sea
coast, and crosses frozen rivers, treeless tundra and huge mountain
passes. Usually the race lasts 11 to 18 days or longer, depending
on weather and other conditions.
   Seventy mushers and dog teams left Anchorage on Saturday.
   The Iditarod, named after a ghost town along the trail,
commemorates the delivery by sled dog teams of a life-saving
diphtheria serum to Nome in 1925.

<HEAD>Communist Central Committee Headquarters to Go to University</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The successor to the now-dissolved Polish
Communist Party is ready to turn over to Warsaw University the
massive building that was party headquarters for four decades.
   The imposing building in central Warsaw, derisively dubbed the
``White House,'' has been at the heart of a nationwide debate over
regaining for the state treasury the vast holdings accumulated by
the Communists when they controlled the government.
   During a weekend meeting, the Social Democracy party, which
inherited the assets of the Communist Party when it disbanded in
January, agreed to hand over the Central Committee headquarters to
a government commission with the recommendation it be given to the
university, said Marek Siwiec.
   ``I don't have to hide our great joy,'' said Wlodzimierz
Siwinski, deputy rector of the university, which plans to use the
building as a library.
   The Social Democracy Party's Supreme Council made the decision
Saturday and representatives met Sunday with the commission
established by the Solidarity-led government to review the legal
status of Communist Party property. The turnover of the building
must be approved by all sides.
   ``Many of those who supported erection of the building wrote or
called us demanding that it should remain in the hands of the
Polish left wing,'' said Siwiec, editor of the Social Democracy
newspaper Trybuna.
   ``But we hope that the needs of culture and science will get
dominating respect and the building will go to the university,''
Siwiec said.
   Since the East bloc's first non-Communist-led government took
power last fall, the Communists have been under intense pressure to
return property no longer supported by membership or power.
   On Monday, General Secretary Leszek Miller reported the Social
Democracy Party had signed up 47,000 members and said he was
satisfied with its growth. The Communist Party claimed a membership
of 2 million.
   The government commission, set up by Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki to defuse public clamor to simply nationalize the
Communist holdings, has found that many buildings were not actually
owned by the party but had been loaned by city officials or other
organizations.
   During negotiations, party leaders have have agreed to turn over
1,600 buildings and offices nationwide.
   Not without glee, the newly independent press has devoted space
in recent weeks to speculation over new uses for the headquarters,
with a McDonald's restaurant one favored possibility.
   But the six-floor building, with 490 rooms and three conference
halls, appears well suited for the university library, woefully
short of funds, space and special facilities required to preserve
rare books, Siwinski said.
   The Social Democracy party will move its headquarters to one of
the buildings it retains following the talks with the government,
Siwiec said.

<DATELINE>AL ARUB, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Facing international pressure
to reopen Palestinian universities, Israel's army on Tuesday
allowed classes to resume at a West Bank teacher's college.
   The peaceful resumption of classes at the Arub Academy and the
planned reopening of other two-year schools were seen as tests for
a possible restart of universities that have been shut almost since
the start of the 26-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   But the army said soldiers closed two elementary schools and a
middle school Tuesday in the West Bank city of Nablus, raising to
27 the number of primary and secondary schools shut so far this
year for disturbances.
   Arab education officials were told the latest closures were
because pupils had stoned West Bank military commander Yitzhak
Mordechai's military jeep.
   The Arub Academy, a men's college that trains students to teach
English, Arabic, Islamic studies and geography, was the scene of
jubilant reunions Tuesday, with students kissing each other on the
cheeks in a traditional Arab greeting.
   ``It's one of the happiest days we have had,'' said Hamad
Sarsur, the headmaster.
   Hurrying for class with a notebook in hand, Yousef Asafreh said
that because of army closures, he has spent more than four years
trying to get a teaching certificate in Arabic that normally takes
two years.
   He and other students said the hillside campus, located near the
Arub refugee camp on the road to Hebron, would not be used for
political protests.
   ``It is our central demand that we be educated,'' said Asafreh,
25. ``Students understand that they cannot receive education with
riots. Riots and education cannot go together.''
   Arub had 82 students and 12 teachers before the uprising began
in December 1987, but only 55 students showed up for class Tuesday.
   Sarsur said he did not yet know if any students were in jail for
anti-Israeli activism.
   He predicted unrest would not start on the Arub campus, adding:
``The students are eager to return to their desks.''
   Army officials said if there was no trouble at the Arub college,
where classes were held peacefully Tuesday, then officials would
open the other 15 community colleges.
   ``It is going to be gradual,'' said one official who demanded
anonymity. ``If there is no incitement or security violations, we
will see all of them open and functioning in a short time.''
   He and other officials declined to make specific pledges but
suggested a peaceful reopening of junior colleges would pave the
way for universities to resume operation.
   The army has kept six Palestinian universities with about 21,000
students and 16 junior colleges and vocational schools with about
5,000 students shut for 26 months.
   Officials say the campuses are potential rallying points for
anti-Israeli violence, but Palestinians contend the closures are an
unjustified collective punishment.
   A leaflet issued by the pro-PLO underground leadership of the
uprising Tuesday called for rallies near college campuses Saturday
to demand the opening of universities and the freeing of jailed
students.
   Israel is being urged by European countries and the United
States to allow universities to resume. In January, the European
Parliament imposed a freeze on scientific cooperation with Israel
until the universities were reopened.
   There was also a call by the Israeli Parliament's education
committee to open one campus to test whether it was safe to resume
classes at other institutions.
   Elsewhere, police spokesman Mordechai Bareket said a 35-year-old
Arab woman who had a police record as a prostitute and drug addict
was killed in Hebron. Her body was found in the yard of her house
with the head smashed and bloodied.
   Arab reports described her as a collaborator with Israeli
authorities, but police said she was not known as a collaborator.
   The death brought to 192 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs during the uprising, most for alleged collaboration or
drug involvement. Some 659 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis, and 43 Israelis have also died.
   In Nablus, the army used bulldozers to destroy the home of
Mohammed Hawwash, whose son Jaber, 20, was arrested last Nov. 8 and
charged with being a member of the Red Eagles, an underground group
blamed for killing alleged collaborators. Six people lived in the
three-room house.
   Also Tuesday, the uprising leaders issued an order allowing
stores in the occupied territories and Arab east Jerusalem to open
for five hours daily, adding two hours to the schedule shops have
kept for most of the uprising.
   A leaflet announced the move, which marked the first easing of
the strict discipline that the rebellion's leaders have tried to
maintain on Palestinians.

<HEAD>Republicans Will Push Repeal of Income Penalties for Older
Americans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional Republicans said Tuesday they
will try to force votes this year on a bill allowing some older
Americans with higher incomes to work without losing a part of
their Social Security pension.
   ``By penalizing seniors who wish to enhance their income and
remain active members of the American work force, current law
actually makes it tougher for many seniors to support themselves,''
said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
   ``Our bill gives senior citizens a choice of whether they want
to work or retire,'' said Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., chief House
sponsor of the legislation.
   The bill has been signed by 181 of the 435 members of the House.
   ``The Senate ... will act'' on the bill this year, predicted
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. If the Democratic-controlled Finance
Comittee fails to approve the measure, he said, ``we are going to
vote on it over and over and over again'' on the Senate floor.
Eighteen of the 100 senators have voiced support for the bill.
   A person who is at least 65 but under 70 may earn $9,360 this
year without losing any Social Security benefits. For each $3
earned above that amount, the worker loses $1 of pension. A person
62, 63 or 64 gives up $1 in benefits for each $2 earned above
$6,840. There is no earnings limit on those 70 and older.
   Republicans have tried for a quarter century to repeal the
earnings limit, contending it effectively imposes the nation's
highest tax burden on older citizens. The Bush administration has
not supported repeal.
   The House approved a significant reduction in the earnings limit
last year, as did the Senate Finance Committee. But the measure was
dropped in the Senate as part of a deficit-reduction agreement.
   The House Ways and Means Committee estimates that repealing the
earnings limit would benefit only the best-off 10 percent of people
between 65 and 70. About one of every five Americans in that age
groups earns an income.
   Hastert cited a study predicting that if the limitation were
repealed, 700,000 older people who do not now work would rejoin the
labor force, creating $132 billion in economic output. He said
repeal would cost the treasury $7.2 billion in federal tax revenues
but $3.2 billion of that would be made up in tax collections on the
new income.

<HEAD>Conservative Thomas Easily Gains Approval as Federal Appeals Judge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday confirmed conservative
civil rights official Clarence Thomas as a federal appeals judge,
brushing aside criticism from senior citizens and liberal groups.
   Senate opposition to Thomas, which once appeared powerful, all
but dissolved as the vote neared. In the end, the critics did not
even request a roll call on the nomination and Thomas was approved
on a voice vote.
   Thomas, 41, becomes a judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in the nation's capital, sometimes called the nation's second
highest court because of the heavily spotlighted cases that come
before it.
   As chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,
Thomas has been one of the most visible blacks in the Reagan and
Bush administrations.
   He was praised by conservatives for his outspoken criticism of
affirmative action programs and quotas as a means of fighting
hiring discrimination, but liberals have chafed under his tenure.
   Born on a poverty ridden farm in rural Georgia, Thomas worked
his way through college and graduated from Yale law school.
   Supporters, led by Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., stressed
Thomas' achievement in climbing the ladder the hard way as well as
what they called his demonstrated legal ability.
   Thomas had worked for Danforth both in the Missouri attorney
general's office and in the Senate. He also was an attorney with
the Monsanto Corp.
   Despite the criticism from senior citizens and some civil rights
leaders, it became clear Monday that opponents had failed to muster
anything resembling the forces needed to defeat the nomination.
   ``I am prepared to concede that Mr. Thomas is going to be
confirmed,'' Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a leading critic,
said Monday when the Senate debated the nomination for about 90
minutes.
   The only other opponent to materialize in the debate was Sen.
David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging.
   Both Metzenbaum and Pryor aimed their criticism at Thomas'
handling of age discrimination cases at the EEOC. Pryor said the
statute of limitations on thousands of such cases lapsed without
action while Thomas was in charge, calling it ``too much to
overlook.''
   Thomas blamed state and local fair-employment commissions for
the lapses.
   ``Mr. Thomas' testimony reveals a fundamental lack of
understanding of both the laws he has been charged with enforcing
for the past eight years and the regulations and procedures of the
agency he has chaired,'' the American Association of Retired
Persons said in a letter to top Judiciary Committee lawmakers after
that hearing.
   However, the AARP neither supported nor opposed confirmation.
The Alliance for Justice, a liberal court-watcher group based in
Washington, campaigned hard to block confirmation.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Legalize Private Ownership, Employment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beset with a sinking economy and rising
discontent, Soviet lawmakers made a drastic break with Communist
orthodoxy Tuesday by voting to allow private citizens to own small
factories and hire their own workers.
   Applause swept through the Kremlin chamber as the Supreme
Soviet, by a 350-3 vote with 11 abstentions, passed the Property
Law, which the official Tass news agency described as ``the main
plank'' of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for economic
reform.
   The law permits Soviets for the first time in nearly seven
decades to privately possess ``means of production,'' an approach
at odds with classic Marxist thinking, which sees in private
ownership the roots of the capitalist exploitation wiped out by the
Russian Revolution 72 years ago.
   Deputy Premier Leonid I. Abalkin said the law, to go into effect
July 1, will enable private citizens to own workshops, garages for
automotive repairs, farm enterprises and other small-scale ventures
to supplement the notoriously ineffective state-run economy.
   Also, subject to restrictions from legislatures in the 15 Soviet
republics, the law permits one citizen to hire another for pay, a
practice that currently is illegal and was a key target of the
Russian revolutionaries.
   In the early 1920s, Vladimir I. Lenin and his Bolsheviks
temporarily retreated from their drive to implement communism and
allowed private ownership of the means of production under the New
Economic Policy, or NEP. The policy was ended under Lenin's
successor, Josef Stalin.
   Tuesday's vote was hailed by supporters not as a tactical move
backward but as a great advance toward a more just and prosperous
society. It again showed Gorbachev's bent for pragmatism, even when
it runs counter to policies pursued by his predecessors for decades.
   Abalkin stressed to reporters that new appoaches were needed to
wrench the country from its economic quagmire, which he said was
deepening. ``Either we speed up the reforms, or we ship things
using military transport,'' he said.
   He revealed that Soviet economic performance had worsened in the
past two months, with industrial production slipping 1 percent.
``There is a crisis of confidence, of confidence in the
government,'' he added.
   Although the Property Law conserves large economic monopolies
for the state-run sector, it declares all forms of ownership
juridically equal, including property owned by individuals, the
government and collectives, and says society gains by competition
among them.
   ``This is an enormous step forward because it lays down the
principle of pluralism in the forms of ownership and the basis of
their equality and their protection from the government,'' said
progressive lawmaker Alexei Yablokov.
   In another sign of the new economic thinking, a
government-sponsored preamble offered by Abalkin proclaiming
``socialist property'' to be the foundation of the country
officially named the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics failed to
pass the 542-seat legislature.
   ``The preamble would turn the law into a propaganda slogan,''
objected deputy Konstantin D. Lubenchenko, a senior lecturer in
Moscow State University's law faculty.
   Despite its new stance on property rights, the law continues to
skirt the socialist aversion to private property by referring
instead to ``the property of citizens.''
   ``It's unfortunate that there is no mention of private property,
but the principle is there,'' Yablokov said. Soviets long have been
permitted to own cars, summer homes and other personal property,
and the new law won't change that.
   Abalkin said a key provision of the 23-page document orders
state-owned factories and other businesses to allocate a share of
after-tax profits to workers.
   By providing them with a material stake in their enterprise's
profitability, the law will presumably encourage Soviets to work
harder, a problem Gorbachev's leadership has said is crucial to
raising the often abysmal rate of productivity.
   Abalkin cautioned that the law was ``just a piece of paper'' and
by itself won't bring about an economic miracle.
   ``We need to change the stereotypes of behavior, and peoples'
psychology,'' he said, apparently referring to the widespread
Soviet hostility toward any form of private enterprise.
   Laws on taxation as well as price reforms, long postponed but
now promised by Jan. 1, also are necessary for a ``decisive step
towards a market economy,'' Abalkin said. The Kremlin keeps the
prices of bread, meat and other foodstuffs artificially low at the
cost of billions of rubles in subsidies.
   The Property Law preserves a government monopoly on the main
pipelines for natural gas and other products, the electric power
grid, space systems, nationwide communications and information
networks and defense industries.
   Neither the law nor a companion bill passed Feb. 28 by the
Supreme Soviet allows the unrestricted buying and selling of land,
as many progressives had wanted, although the Law on Land allows
peasants to bequeath the plots they till to their children.
   The Supreme Soviet also voted to incorporate traditional Marxist
rhetoric into the Property Law outlawing the use of any form of
property ``for the exploitation of one man by another,'' over loud
objections that such wording was a sneak attack on private property.
   ``The most basic exploitation of man and man comes from the
government,'' said Moscow deputy Mikhail A. Bocharov, director of a
pioneering construction materials plant where workers lease the
premises from the state.
   The Supreme Soviet voted separately on each of the bill's six
parts, with the private property section passing 354-0 with 13
abstentions, and then on the bill as a whole.
   The draft, under discussion since fall, came back before the
legislature two weeks ago but was returned to committee because of
ambiguities.
   After voting, the legislature adjourned until it parent body,
the Congress of People's Deputies, meets Monday. The 2,250-member
Congress must give final approval to the Property Law since it will
require amending the Constitution, whose Article 10 still declares
that ``the foundation of the economic system of the U.S.S.R. is
socialist ownership of the means of production.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior Democrats on the Senate Finance
Committee on Tuesday ridiculed President Bush's revenue proposals
and said the administration shows little interest in reducing the
budget deficit.
   Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, and Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., goaded Kenneth Gideon, the assistant treasury
secretary for tax policy, to offer some alternative tax proposals.
Gideon didn't bite.
   ``I am here to defend our revenue proposals,'' Gideon said.
   ``It looks to me like they are a mile wide and an inch deep''
and heavy with gimmicks, Bentsen said.
   He was especially critical of a provision in the Bush budget
that, the administration says, would raise $2.5 billion just by
improved management of the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``I find it very hard to accept the idea that ... by rearranging
a few desks over there ... you are going to have any serious
increase in revenue,'' Bentsen said.
   ``You ought to come before this committee with respectable
proposals,'' Moynihan told Gideon. ``I am embarrassed for your
situation and I suspect you are, too.''
   Bentsen asked why the administration can propose raising the tax
on aviation fuel and defend it as a user fee but oppose a higher
tax on gasoline or automobiles.
   ``We tried to be consistent with our proposals,'' Gideon
replied. ``We think a significant increase in gasoline taxes raises
real problems'' because of disproportionately high use of fuel in
rural states.
   Moynihan was especially upset because three of the revenue
raisers in Bush's budget would further the practice of using Social
Security taxes for deficit reduction.
   ``You don't want to deal with the deficit,'' Moynihan said.
``The deficit is a mode of social discipline.'' The administration,
he said, is happy to argue against increased social spending by
pointing to the size of the deficit.
   The administration, while saying it's proposing no tax increase,
is asking Congress to vote an additional $15.7 billion in new
revenues for the budget year that begins Oct. 1. After subtracting
$1.8 billion worth of targeted tax reductions, that would leave a
net revenue gain of $13.9 billion.
   Those proposals range from raising the tax on airline tickets to
requiring all state and local government employees to pay for
Social Security hospitalization coverage.
   Bentsen told Gideon that congressional authorities say Bush's
proposals would cut the deficit by only $9.4 billion, not $13.9
billion. There is no way to raise $13.9 billion without raising
taxes, Bentsen said.
   Gideon spent a good deal of his time at the hearing defending
Bush's proposal to cut taxes on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of investments. The administration contends a
reduction would provide such an incentive to the economy that it
would increase tax collections.
   Congressional leaders reject that point. Their analysts say the
capital-gains cut would lose $11.4 billion over five years.
   However, the Treasury Department says it would gain $12.5
billion _ a difference of $23.9 billion.

   As Afghanistan's defense minister, Maj.

guerrillas. Instead, he may have plotted with them against
President Najib.
   The attempted coup Tuesday illustrated the simultaneous
challenges Najib faces in trying to pacify enemies in his own party
and end the 12-year-old civil war.
   Kabul radio said Tanai, who became defense minister about 18
months ago, plotted with fundamentalist guerrilla leader Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar. Such an alliance would one of convenience, not ideology,
given Tanai's long advocacy of harsh methods against the guerrillas.
   By linking Tanai to Hekmatyar, the government may be trying to
set the stage for the defense minister's final disgrace.
   In recent months, Najib increasingly has presented Hekmatyar as
the personification of evil while depicting other guerrilla leaders
and field commanders as more rational and welcome to join his
Soviet-backed government.
   Hekmatyar has become increasingly estranged from his fellow
guerrilla leaders, rejecting their political leadership and killing
some of their followers.
   Najib has promoted Tanai, both in the government and Communist
Party, even though the general has a reputation for active
opposition.
   It's become a familiar scenario since the party took control by
coup and assassination in April 1978: Give your enemies power in
hopes of buying obedience, then try to keep them from overthrowing
you.
   Afghan sources from both sides of the party and civil war say
Tanai has been involved in at least the last three of five known
coup attempts since Najib became president in December 1986. The
two most recent ones occurred in July and December.
   Tanai is from the party faction called Khalq, or ``masses,'' and
Najib represents the Parcham, or ``flag,'' faction. Parcham
generally is less hawkish than Khalq, especially when it comes to
making political overtures to the guerrillas.
   Najib loyalists say the president has begun an effort to change
the party, even its name, to make it more acceptable to the
insurgents, the Afghan people and such foreign critics as the
United States. The party's official name is the People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan.
   Such overtures generally have been lost on the Islamic
fundamentalist guerrillas, who refuse to deal with a ``godless''
party.
   Tanai, believed to be in his mid-40s, is known as a foe of any
concessions to the insurgents or modification of the party's
Marxist origins. Najib recently has sought to portray the party as
a defender of Islam and champion of a free-market economy.
   The general comes from the Tanai district near Khost in southern
Afghanistan, and takes his surname from his home region.
   He is a member of the party Politburo, whose membership is said
to be 14. Tanai became defense minister sometime in 1988, but as
often happens in Afghanistan, his appointment apparently was not
announced.
   When Najib changed his Cabinet in February 1989, after Soviet
military forces were withdrawn, Tanai remained in his post.
   An Afghan source in New Delhi said travelers arriving in the
Indian capital Monday reported that Tanai had installed his
ministry in the Darulaman palace on Kabul's southwestern outskirts,
and that it bristled with big guns and antennas.
   He said the travelers spoke of widespread rumors in Kabul over
the weekend that Tanai was planning a coup. The source, like the
others, spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Najib's official residence and office complex, Arg Palace, is in
the heart of Kabul. Both palaces were used by King Zahir Shah, who
was overthrown in 1973 by former Prime Minister Mohammad Daoud, his
cousin.
   Daoud was overthrown and killed in the 1978 coup that brought
the Communists to power.

   Raymond Buckey today pleaded innocent to
eight revived charges in the McMartin preschool molestation case
during a hearing in which his lawyer made an extraordinary motion
to halt dismissal of a sex count.
   ``I am innocent, your honor, not guilty,'' Buckey told Superior
Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg. The judge formally dismissed four
unresolved charges against Buckey and held in abeyance one
contested charge.
   Defense attorney Danny Davis told the judge he wanted to keep in
the case the allegation of sexual misconduct involving the son of
Judy Johnson, the mother whose complaints triggered the McMartin
Pre-School investigation.
   ``It seems a little strange that the defense would be moving
against a dismissal of a count, but I am willing to hear the
motion,'' Weisberg said. An afternoon hearing was scheduled on the
motion.
   There were 13 counts unresolved by jurors in the McMartin trial,
which lasted nearly three years and cost taxpayers more than $10
million. Jurors were leaning to acquittal on the charges involving
the three youngsters in the new trial.
   ``I don't know why they're doing it,'' Buckey said outside
court. ``They've got three of their weakest witnesses. Now I'm
facing a mini-McMartin trial.''
   The district attorney last month dropped a troublesome
conspiracy count against Buckey, 31.
   Buckey spent nearly five years in jail without being convicted
until his release on $1.5 million bail in February 1989.
   When Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, finally came
to trial in 1987, what had originally been hundreds of counts of
child molestation was pruned to 64 counts and a shared count of
conspiracy, and five other defendants had been dropped from the
case. The 41 children once said to have been abused came down to 11
alleged victims.

<HEAD>Newspaper Editors Protest Censorship of Immigration Data</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Editors of four leading daily newspapers on
Tuesday criticized military censorship of reports about Soviet
immigration, arguing the measure hurt Israel's image and violated
press freedom.
   Their protest came a day after U.S. State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler urged Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to reconsider
the censorship order he issued Friday.
   The order, which prohibited publication of how many immigrants
arrived in February, was announced last week after officials
predicted up to 230,000 Soviets would arrive this year.
   Israeli officials said the restrictions that barred publication
of figures and travel routes taken by Soviet immigrants were needed
for security reasons. They cited recent Arab protests about the
influx and fears that immigrants might be attacked.
   The army censor routinely reviews articles pertaining to
military affairs before publication, but coverage of immigration
has rarely been applied.
   Editors and legal experts protested in newspaper editorials,
saying Israeli leaders, not journalists, were to blame for the Arab
anger that followed Shamir's suggestion Israel needed occupied land
to settle Soviet immigrants.
   Moshe Vardi, editor of the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot
daily, accused the government of tarnishing Israel's image at a
time when anti-democratic measures were increasingly unpopular.
   ``In the free world and even beyond, censorship is simply an
incomprehensible term in 1990. It is a vestige of the past,'' he
wrote.
   Vardi and other editors sought a meeting with Shamir. They urged
the government to seek an understanding with editors rather than
impose blanket censorship on the Soviet immigration story.
   Such an unwritten agreement existed during the 1984 airlift of
Ethiopian Jews when self-censorship kept the story secret for
months.
   Other editors and legal experts questioned the government
contention that the flow of Soviet immigration was endangered by
reports about how many were arriving.
   ``The Soviet Union has not conditioned giving exit visas to
keeping it secret, so publicity to the immigration does not
endanger it,'' the liberal daily Haaretz said.
   The paper said the ban contravened the public's democratic right
to know, especially when Israeli leaders have said citizens may
have to pay more taxes to handle the influx of immigrants.

<HEAD>Japanese Prime Minister Urges Higher Standard of Living</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu told Parliament on
Tuesday that Japan must improve living standards to help ease trade
frictions with the United States.
   Expensive housing, high savings and poor public facilities have
kept Japanese living standards low and limited imports, hindering
reduction of the $49 billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan, Kaifu
said.
   ``Our corporations are wealthy and strong, but this wealth has
come at the expense of long working hours and a low standard of
living. It is time to redress this imbalance,'' he said.
   Responding to opposition questions in Parliament's upper house,
Kaifu urged lawmakers to cooperate in changing Japan's economic
structure for the sake of the Japanese people as well as to ease
growing tension with the United States over trade imbalances.
   ``We intend realistic efforts to carry out structural reforms.
That means we must carry out reforms of our land use policies and
improve the standard of living,'' he said.
   Actions by two Cabinet members Tuesday improved the chances for
pledges made by Kaifu at last week's California summit with
President Bush.
   Minister of International Trade and Industry Kabun Muto ended
opposition to changing a retail stores law that U.S. officials say
tends to prevent foreign firms from increasing sales in Japan.
   U.S. trade negotiators and domestic business circles say the law
hinders foreign retailers from opening outlets and slows the
opening of large Japanese stores that would more likely sell
foreign-made goods.
   Ministry officials said they were considering changing or
abolishing the law. Muto had told Japanese reporters that bolder
steps might have to be taken if easing its enforcement is not
enough to satisfy the United States.
   Washington also says Japan should provide more land for housing,
cut inflated real estate prices and spend more on roads, parks and
sewers to improve the general quality of life.
   Such spending is seen as likely to create more demand for
foreign products while reducing the dependence of Japan's economy
on exports.
   Meanwhile, Japan's top defense official said Tokyo would
consider paying more for the 50,000 U.S. armed forces members in
Japan if the United States officially makes such a request.
   But Yozo Ishikawa, director general of the Defense Agency, said
at a news conference that he had heard nothing ``official'' about a
statement on the matter by U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in a
television interview Sunday.
   Cheney said he wants Japan to assume ``100 percent'' of the cost
of maintaining U.S. military bases in Japan.
   Japan pays $2.4 billion of the estimated $6 billion annual cost
of basing U.S. forces in Japan, the Defense Agency says.
   At their summit, Kaifu promised Bush to do his best to carry out
substantial reforms and increase Japan's contributions to regional
security. But he faces strong opposition from other parties.
   Kaifu's opponents, led by the Socialists, the No. 1 opposition
to his Liberal Democratic Party, dominate the upper house and are
likely to obstruct action on trade and defense-related issues.
   The Socialists and some other opposition parties oppose
increasing defense spending and are highly critical of Japan's
security relationship with the United States.
   Parliament also has been bogged down in battles over a bribery
scandal and a new sales tax, preventing debate on trade-related
reforms in the past year.
   Kaifu is urging Japan Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi and
other opposition leaders to abandon their attacks on the sales tax,
given the comfortable majority his party won in Feb. 18 lower house
elections, to enable Parliament to act on other pressing issues.

   The Pomona Valley quivered again Tuesday
as the number of measurable aftershocks from last week's rumbling
earthquake reached an estimated 400 to 500.
   The aftershock at 10:01 a.m. measured 3.1 on the Richter scale
and was centered four miles northwest of Upland, said Bob Finn,
spokesman for seismologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It was very mild,'' said Michael Guerin, spokesman for the
state Office of Emergency Services in Ontario, about five miles
from the epicenter. ``We're at the point now where we don't even
look up from our computers.''
   The Feb. 28 quake, centered three miles northwest of Upland,
measured 5.5 on the Richter scale, causing some minor injuries and
more than $12 million in damage, Guerin said.
   Finn said that by midday Tuesday, seismometers had detected 400
to 500 aftershocks, but only about three dozen measured at least
magnitude 2.3, large enough to be felt.
   Many people reported feeling what they thought was another quake
early Tuesday, but Finn said it was the sonic boom from an SR-71
Blackbird spy plane looping over northern Los Angeles County. The
retired spy jet made a record 68-minute flight from Palmdale to its
new home at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.

<HEAD>Prelate Hopeful of Papal Visit to an Independent Lithuania Soon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's Roman Catholic cardinal was quoted
Tuesday as saying he hopes the Soviet republic will achieve its
independence by next year and that Pope John Paul II will be the
first visitor to the country.
   In an interview in Kaunas with the Italian Catholic daily
Avvenire, Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius suggested the pope could
combine the trip with a planned return to his native Poland, which
adjoins Lithuania, in June 1991.
   ``He would be the first and most welcome guest of a free
Lithuania,'' the cardinal was quoted as saying.
   Sladkevicius told the newspaper the church supports the cause of
independence for the Baltic republic ``with all its heart'' and
urged Western nations to do the same.
   Lithuania, an independent country before World War II, was
occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. An estimated 2.5 million
people, or 80 percent of Lithuania's population, are Roman
Catholics.
   In elections last month, Lithuanians elected a legislature that
is expected to push Soviet authorities for independence this year.
The Lithuanian Communist Party has also joined the call for
independence.
   John Paul has disclosed that he twice had been barred from
visiting Lithuania. At a meeting at the Vatican in September,
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev invited the pope to the Soviet Union
but John Paul made no commitment.
   Sladkevicius said if the pope were to go first to Moscow and
then to Lithuania ``it would demonstrate that we are part of the
Soviet Union. I don't think John Paul will do something like that.''
   ``There is another hypothesis,'' the cardinal was quoted as
saying. ``If Lithuania becomes independent soon, let's say next
year, the pope could come here from Warsaw, combining the visit to
Lithuania with that planned for Poland in June 1991.''

<TEXT>
   Not to be outdone by McDonald's, Time Warner
Inc. announced plans Tuesday to open American-style,
multiple-screen movie theaters next year in Moscow and Leningrad,
where audiences will be allowed to eat popcorn in their seats for
the first time.
   The two ultramodern theaters are expected to open in late 1991
at a cost of $28 million, and will offer the Soviet Union's avid
moviegoers a total of 19 new screens and 7,400 new seats to enjoy
popular foreign and domestic films, U.S. and Soviet officials said.
   The theaters will feature state-of-the-art projection and Dolby
stereo sound systems, computerized ticket booths, concession stands
in marble and neon lobbies, restaurants, souvenir shops and video
game arcades _ with parking lots out front.
   American popcorn, a novelty to Soviet audiences, will be sold
along with candy and soft drinks. And in a break with Soviet
tradition, moviegoers who formerly were required to consume
refreshments at buffet counters in theater lobbies will be able to
carry them to their seats in the new theaters.
   ``Hooray for Hollywood and Leningrad and Moscow, too,'' said
Time Warner President N.J. Nicholas Jr. at a news conference at the
Soviet Embassy where Ambassador Yuri Dubinin toasted ``the healthy
future of this Soviet-American child.''
   The project is a joint venture between Time Warner, a worldwide
publishing and entertainment conglomerate whose Warner Bros.
International Theaters Co. subsidiary will own 60 percent of the
theaters, and the official Soviet film agency, v@o Sovexportfilm,
which will own 40 percent.
   The announcement came less than two months after McDonald's
opened its first fast-food restaurant in the Soviet capital Jan.
31, serving an opening-day record of 30,000 meals to hungry
Muscovites.
   Plans for the two new theaters doubtless will be good news to
Soviet moviegoers, who see an average of 14 films a year compared
to the four seen by their American counterparts, according to
industry estimates.
   ``They'll have every auditorium completely filled every hour of
the day,'' predicted Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America.
   The largest of Moscow's more than 100 movie theaters, the Russia
Theater, contains a 1,200-seat auditorium for feature films and a
500-seat room for documentaries.
   By contrast, the new Warner multiplex in the Soviet capital will
boast 10 screens and 4,000 seats. It will be built on Novokirovsky
Prospekt near a major railroad and subway terminal. The Leningrad
theater, also near a subway station, will have nine screens and
3,400 seats.
   Oleg A. Rudnev, the jowly, bushy-browed general director of the
Soviet film agency, said the new theaters will be free to show
potentially controversial American movies such as ``The Hunt for
Red October,'' the newly released, pre-glasnost tale of a Soviet
submarine commander who defects to the United States.
   ``There is no censorship anymore,'' Rudnev said through an
interpreter. ``It is probably not possible to surprise the Soviet
viewer any longer.''
   Time Warner officials said ticket prices won't be decided until
American films are test-marketed in Moscow and Leningrad to
determine what Soviet viewers are willing to pay.
   Embassy officials said movie tickets in Moscow average about 50
kopeks, or eight cents, under the unofficial exchange rate for
foreign visitors. Prices are cheaper for matinees and more costly _
about 25 cents _ for lengthy, popular feature films in more
luxurious theaters.

<TEXT>
   All sides in Northern Ireland,
from the IRA to Ian Paisley, are talking about peace, but not to
each other as yet.
   With Catholics and Protestants both unhappy with the status quo,
feelers sprout from many directions: from Irish Prime Minister
Charles Haughey, the Protestant leaders of the Unionist parties,
the main Roman Catholic parties, and the British government.
   The contacts continued Tuesday as Peter Brooke, the top British
official in the province, met with three Unionists.
   ``We didn't expect there would be any startling development,''
said Ken Maginnis, a member of Parliament from the Ulster Unionist
Party. Maginnis, whose goal is the creation of a provincial
government to end 18 years of direct rule from London, said no one
should expect a sudden breakthrough.
   ``I want to see a devolved government ... but I want to see
something that people will feel confident with, not something that
becomes just another millstone around our necks,'' Maginnis said.
   The ``millstone,'' as Unionists see it, is the Anglo-Irish
Agreement signed by Britain and Ireland in the Northern Ireland
village of Hillsborough in 1985.
   The treaty guaranteed Ireland an advisory role in Northern
Ireland affairs and pledged the two governments to cooperate

<BYLINE>Mandela Arrives to Tumultuous Greeting in Tanzania

<DATELINE>DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela on Tuesday brought
his crusade for black majority rule in South Africa to Tanzania,
the home of thousands of exiled black compatriots.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, was
met by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, the first African
leader to offer the ANC guerrilla training camps outside of South
Africa.
   ``How are you, teacher?'' Mandela asked Nyerere in Swahili as he
stepped off a special Air Zimbabwe flight from Harare.
   Mandela and Nyerere last met in early 1962, when Mandela came to
Tanzania to ask the former president to establish training camps in
this East African country.
   Thousands turned out at Dar es Salaam's international airport
and waited through an hour-long rainstorm to greet the 71-year-old
Mandela, who was freed from a South African prison four weeks ago.
   As Mandela emerged from his plane, the crowd raised a roar of
``Viva ANC!'' After inspecting an honor guard, Mandela was escorted
to a group of exiled ANC members.
   ``I am so glad I have seen him at last,'' said a bearded South
African who refused to give his name but said he had fled his
country in 1964.
   Mandela was to address a rally in Dar es Salaam and fly to
Zanzibar, an island republic of Tanzania, on Wednesday, and visit
the ANC camps about 100 miles west of Dar es Salaam on Thursday.
   He planned to address many of the 3,000 ANC exiles who live in
Tanzania. Most are due to return home by the end of this year.
   Before ending his three-day stay in Zimbabwe, Mandela said he
had learned a lesson.
   ``Zimbabwe's reconciliation is an experience from which we want
to profit,'' Mandela said, referring to President Robert Mugabe's
policy of reconciliation between whites and blacks.
   Until independence from Britain 10 years ago, Zimbabwe was the
white-ruled colony of Rhodesia. But after a seven-year guerrilla
war the black majority assumed power under Mugabe.
   Mandela views Zimbabwe as a role model for his own country,
where 5 million whites wield economic and political power over 28
million voteless blacks.
   The ANC leader said he wanted to discuss ways of steering the
country towards black majority rule with all political movements in
South Africa, including the rival Pan-Africanist Congress.
   On whites' demands for guarantees for their future, Mandela said
the ANC was still examining the question but hoped to allay the
minority's fears.
   Mandela was freed from 27 years imprisonment on Feb. 11 by
President F.W. de Klerk after the ANC, the PAC and the South
African Communist Party were legitimized for the first time in 30
years.
   The release heralded the beginning of negotiations between the
white-run government and anti-apartheid movements towards a new
political framework.
   Mandela is expected to hold his first talks with de Klerk this
month after returning from Sweden.

<HEAD>Japan Successfully Tests Advanced Rocket Engine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan successfully tested one of the world's most
advanced rocket engines Tuesday and officials said the engine will
have the capability to launch large, sophisticated satellites.
   The LE-7 engine ``burned normally'' during a four-second firing
test, the National Space Development Agency said. The sophisticated
engine is to power the first stage of a new Japanese rocket, the
H-2, on which Japan has pinned many of its hopes for future space
exploration.
   The current mainstay of the Japanese space program, the H-1
rocket, can lift only 1,210 pounds into geostationary orbit, making
it incapable of launching large, sophisticated communications
satellites.
   Development of the Japanese-designed H-2 also will also free
Japan from U.S. veto power over commercial launches of
third-country satellites, imposed as a licensing condition for U.S.
technology used in previous Japanese rockets.
   The H-2 is slated to go into service in March 1992 and will
match the two-ton geostationary payload capabilities of current
U.S., Soviet and European rockets.
   The LE-7 engine, powered by liquid hydrogen and oxygen, uses a
high-technology propulsion system similar to that on the U.S. space
shuttle.
   Tuesday's success followed a string of development problems that
technicians attributed to the extremely high stresses inside the
high-performance engine.
   The first stage of the current H-1 rocket is based on
25-year-old U.S. Delta rocket technology licensed from McDonnell
Douglas, but the second stage is designed in Japan and also will be
used as the second stage of the H-2.
   McDonnell Douglas officials recently asked Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries to supply it with the new second stage to update the
Delta rocket, Japanese officials say.
   On Feb. 22, a European Ariane 44-L rocket carrying two Japanese
communications satellites exploded shortly after liftoff,
destroying both satellites, reportedly worth $600 million. Analysts
say the accident is likely to further encourage Japan to develop
its own space capabilities.
   Despite a late start, due in part to a post-World War II ban by
U.S. occupation authorities and low budgets, Japan's space program
has progressed steadily and achieved an enviable success record.
   A Japanese satellite, Muses-A, is due to reach the moon on March
18, making Japan the third nation after the Soviet Union and the
United States to reach Earth's closest neighbor.

<HEAD>SEC, Soviet Bloc Officials Discuss Emerging East European Stock
Markets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street's watchdog, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said Tuesday that it wants to help advise the
emerging free economies of Eastern Europe on how to keep their
infant stock markets orderly and honest.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who met recently with
high-level financial officials from the Soviet Union, Hungary and
Poland, said the agency would form an Advisory Committee on
Emerging Securities Markets in Eastern Europe.
   ``The SEC's expertise in this area hopefully can assist in a
successful transition to efficient private capital markets with
necessary oversight and supervision,'' Breeden said.
   The committee will recommend what action the SEC and the
financial industry can take to help create organized securities
markets in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Breeden said there ``is no more fitting manner'' for the United
States ``to aid the process of economic development in Eastern
Europe and in the Soviet Union than by assisting in the creation of
free capital markets in these countries.''
   Breeden and other SEC officials met Feb. 21 with a high-level
delegation from the Soviet government that was reviewing the
operation of U.S. banking and securities markets.
   Breeden has held similar meetings with delegations from Poland
and Hungary, including one with President Bush and the leader of an
effort to expand the small Hungarian securities exchange.
   The SEC anticipates eventually receiving additional requests for
assistance from several other governments in creating securities
markets.
   No one has been named to the panel, but SEC officials hope to
include leaders of U.S. securities companies, other financial firms
and senior representatives of self-regulatory organizations such as
securities exchanges.
   Breeden said he hoped the advisory committee's first meeting
could be held in April.

<HEAD>Will the Pentagon Disappear Under Its Mountain of Supplies?</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon increased its stockpile of
unrequired spare parts and supplies by $4 billion over three years,
creating a system that ``is like opening the door to Imelda Marcos'
closet,'' a lawmaker said Tuesday.
   The General Accounting Office released three reports describing
widespread problems in the Defense Department's management of its
$103 billion supply system, including excessive purchases of
unnecessary items and storage space devoted to obsolete items.
   Officials from the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, told
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that in 1987 the
department had a $30 billion inventory of unrequired items. Three
years later, the stockpile costs $34 billion.
   The GAO said it based its report on Pentagon estimates.
   ``Although we found no dominant reason that caused inventory
growth, we believe the growth results from a tendency to stock far
into the future,'' said Frank C. Conahan, assistant comptroller
general. ``This is fostered by a management philosophy that rewards
obligating funds and filling orders.
   ``There is no corresponding emphasis on economy or efficiency,''
he said.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood told the Senate panel
the Pentagon has moved to implement reforms proposed in last year's
Defense Management Review.
   If the Eastern bloc nations could turn toward democracy in a
single year, said Atwood, ``I don't see why we can't reform the
Defense Department.''
   According to the GAO, the Navy had 53 reactor assemblies for a
sonar system. But 51 of them, totaling $160,000, were not needed.
The agency said neither the Navy's item manager nor the branch
chief had records or knew why the items were unrequired.
   By definition, required items are supplies for future wars and
two years or more of peacetime operations. Unrequired are those
beyond the necessary stockpile.
   The GAO also found an inventory manager increased the
requirement for shirts from a six-month supply to a five-year
supply. The Defense Logistics Agency later found itself with
379,000 shirts and 1,078,000 on order when the requirement only
called for 424,000.
   The excess totaled a seven-year supply for $8.7 million.
   The reports prompted outrage from members of the Senate panel.
   ``Looking into the Pentagon supply system is like opening the
door to Imelda Marcos' closet. You see excess _ staggering
excess,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., referring to the former
first lady of the Philippines known for her buying sprees.
   ``The Defense Department's tens of billions of dollars in
unrequired inventories, unwisely purchased during the Reagan years,
continue to grow,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the
Senate panel.
   ``It's warehouses are gorged with the overflow and are filled
beyond capacity.''
   The GAO also warned the problem may be worse than their
estimates because it found a number of cases where the Pentagon
added or planned to add unnecessary requirements for supplies.

   The new military rulers of the
Ciskei homeland declared a state of emergency Tuesday in a bid to
end looting and rioting following their coup that has left 27
people dead and 550 injured.
   There were reports of more looting despite the presence of South
African troops, who were sent in to quell the violence at the
request of the new rulers in Ciskei.
   Dissident army officers led by Brig. Gen. Oupa Gqozo staged a
bloodless coup Sunday that ousted Ciskei's President Lennox Sebe
while he was in Hong Kong on a trade mission.
   Ciskei, a 3,600-square-mile territory of about 1 million people
on the Indian Ocean coast, is one of 10 black homelands in South
Africa. They are recognized only by the Pretoria government.
   South Africa established the homelands in the 1960s to try to
create separate, tribal-based states for blacks while whites retain
control of national politics and the economy.
   Looting and rioting erupted Sunday evening, and more than 50
stores and factories, many owned by Israelis and Taiwanese, have
been destroyed.
   Doctors at hospitals in Ciskei and nearby East London in South
Africa said 27 people had been killed and more than 550 injured in
violence following the coup. Most of the dead and injured suffered
gunshot and stabbing wounds, the doctors said.
   The military rulers announced the state of emergency Tuesday
evening. Gqozo told the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
that his government had begun to release political prisoners held
by Sebe, and he said the new government would investigate charges
of corruption against the ousted president.
   Human rights groups say Sebe's government detained hundreds of
dissidents.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha, speaking to Parliament
in Cape Town, said additional South African troops had been moved
into the area as a reserve force.
   South Africa's pro-apartheid Conservative Party criticized the
South African government for not intervening sooner in Ciskei to
prevent the chaos.
   ``These little stone-throwing, looting arsonist (criminals) are
probably a precursor to the new South Africa,'' said Tom Langley, a
member of Parliament for the Conservatives.
   Botha said he was informed Friday of a possible coup attempt in
Ciskei and passed the information on to Sebe, who ignored it and
left for Hong Kong the same day.
   The deposed president apparently did not inform his wife, who
remained at the official residence in Ciskei. She was taken from
the residence Tuesday in a car bearing South African diplomatic
license plates.
   Sebe, meanwhile, was expected to return Wednesday to South
Africa. His plans were unclear, but it appeared doubtful he would
try to return to Ciskei.
   South Africa has neither formally recognized the new military
rulers nor given any indication that it opposes them. The South
Africans recognize the military government in the neighboring
Transkei homeland that came to power in a 1987 coup.
   The coup appears to have wide support in Ciskei. Many residents
opposed Sebe and considered his rule oppressive and corrupt.
   But the jubilation over the coup quickly turned violent as
drunken mobs rampaged in several towns.
   ``It was a drunken orgy of violence. ... Dozens of buildings
were gutted,'' said journalist Louise Flanagan.
   Gqozo received a rousing cheer Monday when he told thousands of
people at a stadium in Bisho that the African National Congress and
other anti-apartheid groups would be free to engage in political
activity in Ciskei.
   The ANC is the main black group fighting South Africa's
white-run government. South African President F.W. de Klerk
legalized the ANC last month, but some homeland leaders do not
allow the group to operate in the territories they control.
   Gqozo said he would like to see Ciskei relinquish its nominal
independence and return to South Africa. The Transkei homeland is
considering a similar plan. The South African government has not
taken a position on homelands that want to return to South Africa.

   The government of Chad continues to detain, torture
and summarily execute political prisoners despite the adoption of a
new Constitution guaranteeing human rights, Amnesty International
said Wednesday.
   President Hissene Habre has direct knowledge of some of the
abuses, and many of the several hundred political detainees had
been held within 50 yards of the presidential office, the human
rights organization said.
   Chad has been ``a catalogue of horror'' since Habre gained power
in 1982, said Amnesty International representative Jamal Benomar,
speaking at a news conference Tuesday. He said Habre's government
had refused to respond to Amnesty International's allegations and
refused to disclose any information about the fate of political
prisoners.
   ``The authorities have never admitted that these detainees
exist,'' Benomar said.
   According to the Amnesty International report, some prisoners
were arbitrarily detained because they belonged to a particular
ethnic group suspected of anti-government activities. Others were
detained solely because of relatives' activities, the report said.
   In December, the government adopted a new constitution that
guarantees basic individual rights, as well as freedom of speech
and assembly. But Amnesty International said there had been no
perceptible change in the government's treatment of political
prisoners.
   Benomar said torture of political prisoners in Chad has become
routine, with increasing use of electric shocks. Women prisoners
have been forced by soldiers to serve as slaves and prostitutes,
the report said.
   ``Prisoners are held incommunicado and denied medical
attention,'' the report said. ``No one sees the detainees except
the security personnel guarding and interrogating them.''
   Habre became president in 1982 after driving a Libyan-backed
rival out of the capital, N'Djamena, during a civil war. In
December, his government claimed voters in a referendum gave
overwhelming approval to the new constitution and to a new,
seven-year term for Habre.
   He said the election introduced Chad to ``an era of democracy,''
but has allowed no opposition political activity.
   Benomar said some opponents of the government have crossed the
border into Sudan and are taking up arms against Habre.

   The U.N. Human Rights Commission on Tuesday
demanded the immediate release of all hostages worldwide and issued
a special appeal to respect the work of the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
   In Beirut, the Red Cross appealed to captors holding two of its
workers to release them or let them write to their families.
   The resolution adopted by the 43-nation commission censured the
actions of all hostage-takers, ``whatever their motives'' and
expressed alarm at the number of kidnappings worldwide.
   ``As long as there is one hostage left in the world, the
international community must state and restate its disapproval,'' a
French delegate said, introducing the U.N. resolution.
   The text was similar to measures approved by the commission in
previous years but added the special appeal to respect
International Red Cross workers.
   Elio Erriquez, 23, and Emmanuel Christen, 32, orthopedic
technicians at a Red Cross artificial limb center in south
Lebanon's port city of Sidon, were abducted five months ago. No
group has claimed responsibility and international appeals have
drawn no response.
   ``We will spare no effort to ... find a solution to this
problem,'' said Angelo Gnaedinger, a Red Cross official, in his
message to the captors.
   He said that over the past five months the Red Cross has
contacted political and military leaders in Lebanon who pledged
support in trying to win their release.
   Christian and Erriquez are among 18 Westerners held hostage in
Lebanon. The others are eight Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.
   Held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The U.N. resolution was sponsored by France, Belgium, Britain,
Colombia, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Soviet Union and West
Germany. Switzerland and Togo joined as non-voting observers.

   President Bush, an avid baseball fan and
father of a major-league team owner, checked his swing Tuesday when
pitched a question on baseball's labor dispute.
   ``I was tempted,'' he allowed.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later that the administration
would not get involved the three-week owners' lockout that's
threatening the 1990 season.
   ``He's concerned about the fans and the game of baseball. He
would like to see the issue resolved. But he has no intentions to
intervene,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president, who was first baseman and captain of his 1948
Yale University baseball team and whose son, George W. Bush, is
part owner of the Texas Rangers, fielded the baseball question
during a picture-taking session with Italian Prime Minister Giulo
Andreotti in the Oval Office.
   ``Do you think anything should be done about the baseball
strike?'' a reporter asked.
   Bush laughed and told Andreotti: ``There's a strike on, and our
son owns one of the teams or is the managing owner or managing
partner of one of the baseball teams.
   ``She's asking me about the strike knowing that I won't take
questions at a photo opportunity. However, she got close to
something I might answer. She got very close there. I was
tempted,'' Bush said.
   Although the president and reporter both called it a ``strike,''
Bush's son and the rest of the baseball owners actually have locked
the players out of spring training in the dispute over major league
baseball's basic bargaining agreement.
   The dispute has already forced cancellation of half of the
scheduled pre-season exhibition games and was threatening the April
2 opening day.
   Fitzwater was asked if Bush had spoken to his son about the
walkout.
   ``I don't know whether he's talked to George privately about it
or not. He doesn't have any plans to weigh in publicly,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Asked about whether the president would deal with ``economic
dislocations'' to spring-training states such as Florida and
Arizona, Fitzwater laughed and said: ``Well, there's a bargaining
process set up to resolve this issue and that's the appropriate
forum.''

   The Bush administration and fellow congressmen
on Tuesday lauded a plan by Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., to designate
the route of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery voting rights march as a
national historic trail.
   Three weeks before the March 1965 protest, Lewis led a group of
525 demonstrators onto the Edmund Pettys Bridge in Selma, Ala., for
a planned march to Montgomery.
   The group was attacked by state troopers; Lewis was severely
beaten. Television accounts of the attack brought thousands of
people to Selma for the subsequent march, which resulted in
congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act.
   Testifying for the bill, Herbert Cables, deputy director of the
National Park Service, told the House interior subcommittee on
national parks and public lands, ``The fact that citizens shed
their blood to demonstrate their right to vote should never be
orgotten.''
   Cables told Lewis the nation owes him ``a debt of gratitude ...
for what you did 25 years ago.''
   The park service official said the adminstration supports Lewis'
bill to authorize a one-year study to determine if the march route
qualifies for designation as a national historic trail.
   Edwin Bearss, chief historian of the park service, said the
agency normally will not consider a historic designation until 50
years after an event. But the Selma to Montgomery march, he said,
is ``transcendental.''
   Lewis said designation of the march route as a national historic
trail would ``serve as a reminder of the right and responsibility
to vote'' and will recognize the sacrifices of those who fought to
ensure that right for all Americans.
   ``Congress may have passed the Voting Rights Act,'' he said,
``but the law was written by the marchers on the road from Selma to
Montgomery.''

<HEAD>Testimony: South African Military Approved ANC Disruption Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military approved plans in
1985 for undercover agents to go abroad to disrupt operations of
the exiled African National Congress guerrilla movement, an army
general testified Tuesday.
   Maj. Gen. Joep Joubert said the proposal was approved by Magnus
Malan, who has been defense minister since 1980. However, Joubert
did not specify any actions that have been carried out in the past
five years.
   Several prominent ANC officials outside South Africa have been
assassinated or have had attempts on their lives in recent years.
   The ANC, the main group fighting the white-run government, was
legalized last month by President F.W. de Klerk. It has offices in
more than 30 countries, but most of its estimated 15,000 exiled
members are expected to begin returning to South Africa shortly.
   Joubert testified on the second day of a judicial inquiry into
allegations that the military and police participated in death
squads.
   Much of the testimony has focused on a shadowy military unit
known as the Civil Cooperation Bureau, which South African Police
say they suspect of involvement in the killing of government
opponents.
   The bureau, which employed former police officers and other
civilians, was set up to carry out operations that could not be
traced to the military or the government, according to other
generals who testified Tuesday.
   Malan said Monday he didn't know until November 1989 that the
bureau existed.
   Activists, meanwhile, have alleged that the police and military
have been involved in the unsolved killings of some 60 activists in
the past decade.
   Maj. Gen. Jan Klopper testified that the Civil Cooperation
Bureau grew out of other covert units and was formally established
in 1986.
   The military has said the secret bureau had 139 members, an
annual budget of $ 11 million and was engaged in highly sensitive
intelligence gathering operations in South Africa and abroad.
   Yet top military and government officials have claimed they had
no knowledge of the bureau until recently.
   De Klerk and Deputy Defense Minister Wynand Breytenbach have
said they learned of the unit's existence in January.
   Meanwhile, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu responded with humor
Tuesday following revelations that the bureau had planned to send
him a baboon fetus.
   ``We used to think (soldiers in the bush) were looking for
so-called terrorists,'' said Tutu. But, he added, ``all they were
looking for was pregnant baboons.''
   Gen. Rudolph Badenhorst, head of Military Intelligence,
testified Monday about the baboon plot, but said he didn't know the
reason for the plan, which was never carried out.
   Badenhorst acknowledged that the Civil Cooperation Bureau blew
up a Pretoria store owned by an anti-apartheid activist and bombed
a community hall in a mixed-race township near Cape Town.
   No military officers have been charged in connections with the
activities of the bureau, but two men have been detained for
questioning and police are searching for several others.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin
will travel to North Korea in mid-March in his first trip outside
China since assuming his office in June, it was reported Tuesday.
   Jiang will make the goodwill visit at the invitation of North
Korean President Kim Il Sung, according to the official Xinhua News
Agency.
   Jiang's visit accentuates the close ties between the two
hard-line Communist states, particularly at a time when North
Korean relations with its other main ally, the Soviet Union, have
been strained by Soviet reforms and ideological changes.
   North Korea also needs to bolster its ties with China as East
European nations and the Soviet Union move toward official
relations with South Korea.
   China does 3 billion U.S. dollars worth of annual trade with the
South and sanctions non-official ties, but insists it will not
normalize relations with the Seoul government and continues to
support the North on all Korean issues.
   Jiang's trip follows an unannounced three-day visit to Beijing
by Kim in November. The 77-year-old Korean leader reportedly sought
to reaffirm the two countries' longstanding socialist ties amid
upheaval in Eastern Europe and head off any tendency toward
increased China-South Korean contacts.
   Jiang's predecessor, Zhao Ziyang, also visited Pyongyang last
April, when student-led pro-democracy demonstrations were filling
the streets of Beijing and conservatives such as Premier Li Peng
were consolidating a hard-line position toward the students.
   On June 24, three weeks after the military crushed the democracy
campaign, the party accused Zhao of supporting the demonstrators
and ousted him from all his posts. It named Jiang, then party chief
of Shanghai, to head the 48 million-member party.

<DATELINE>JOUNIEH, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian warlord Samir Geagea said
Tuesday he believes the latest truce in his confrontation with
renegade Gen. Michel Aoun will endure.
   ``Nothing can be solved by war. I think this cease-fire will
hold,'' said Geagea, who was interviewed at a forward militia
command post in Jounieh, north of Beirut.
   The truce began Friday and ended more than a month of fighting
between Lebanon's two top Christian leaders that left 750 dead and
2,088 wounded.
   Geagea said the Vatican and France were instrumental in
convincing Aoun to accept the truce.
   He said French and Vatican officials said they would not hinder
a Syrian military intervention if Aoun did not end the
intra-Christian fighting.
   ``They told Gen. Aoun if you want to continue the war in east
Beirut, we shall consider ourselves unconcerned (with what's
happening) and we believe big events could happen as a result,''
Geagea said.
   The cease-fire was called by Maronite Catholic Patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Sfeir had threatened to excommunicate Aoun, Geagea and their
followers if they did not stop the shooting.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronites, the Christian sect that has
dominated Lebanon since independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun initiated the intra-Christian confrontation by demanding
the disbanding of Geagea's Lebanese Forces, the main military
challenge to his claim as sole authority in the Christian enclave.
   But Tuesday, Geagea again said merging his Lebanese Forces with
Aoun's army ``is out of the question.''
   ``Only when the civil war ends and a strong state based on
certain foundations emerges will that happen. We shall then be the
first to disband our militia,'' he added.
   Geagea said his forces have had contacts with U.S. officials and
that Iraq helped mediate between his militia and Aoun's army
through its embassy in East Beirut.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab foe, was Aoun's primary backer during
the general's failed six-month war of liberation to evict the
Syrians last year. It was also a major arms supplier for the
militia.
   Geagea refused to clearly state whether he recognized the
Syrian-allied government of President Elias Hrawi. Hrawi was
elected in November in line with an Arab-brokered peace accord to
end Lebanon's 15-year-old war civil war.
   Aoun has rejected the peace pact and the government of Hrawi,
which dismissed Aoun as army commander. Aoun has criticized the
peace plan for not laying out a timetable for a complete withdrawal
of Syrian forces.
   Syria has 40,000 troops in about 70 percent of Lebanon.
   Geagea refused to take a clear position on the Lebanese peace
pact.
   ``There are good things in it and bad things,'' he said without
elaboration.
   Hrawi is on a tour of Arab states for talks on ending the bloody
intra-Christian dispute and to push through the Lebanese peace pact.
   He left Saudi Arabia for Algeria Monday, ending two days of
talks with King Fahd, who promised military aid, sources said.

<HEAD>Bush Names Treasury Official to Top Thrift Regulatory Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday named Assistant
Treasury Secretary Salvatore R. Martoche as acting director of the
the Office of Thrift Supervision, the agency that regulates the
nation's savings and loan institutions.
   Martoche immediately promised to ``provide stability and
leadership'' to the government's oversight of the troubled S&amp;L
industry.
   The interim appointment fills the vacancy created by the
resignation last December of M. Danny Wall, who quit under
criticism from members of Congress for his handling of the S&amp;L
crisis in his 2{-year tenure.
   Martoche, a former U.S. attorney from Buffalo, was named by Bush
to serve ``until a new director is in place.''
   Administration officials said the search for a permanent
successor to Wall is continuing. Sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the Treasury Department planned to forward its
recommendation within several days.
   Congressional Democrats have been pointing to the Bush
administration's failure to recruit a permanent successor to Wall
as evidence that the S&amp;L bailout was falling into disarray.
   Because the Martoche appointment is an interim one, it does not
require Senate confirmation.
   When speculation surfaced that Jonathan Fiechter, senior deputy
in charge of policy at the agency, might be named as interim
director, S&amp;L industry officials raised questions over the legality
of any actions taken by an acting director who was not confirmed by
the Senate.
   Martoche's appointment was expected to alleviate that problem
because he has already been through the confirmation process in his
current Treasury post.
   Martoche said in a statement he would ``seek to provide
stability and leadership to the agency during the transition.'' He
also said he would appoint Fiechter as his principal deputy
director.
   Martoche takes over the reins of the agency overseeing the
restructuring of the troubled S&amp;L industry, and will preside over a
growing list of lawsuits against savings industry executives
accused of illegal lending practices.
   Wall, criticized in Congress for underestimating the S&amp;L crisis
and acting slowly against the California-based Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association, announced Dec. 4 he would resign as soon as the
administration found a replacement.
   However, as the months passed, Wall indicated he was anxious to
leave soon.
   Martoche is currently assistant secretary of the Treasury for
enforcement, overseeing the Secret Service, the Customs Service and
the agency's drug-intervention programs.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision, formerly known as the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, was extensively overhauled last year as part
of the 10-year, $150 billion S&amp;L rescue legislation.
   The measure placed the agency under the control of the Treasury
Department and removed many of its previous powers. Under the
legislation, a new agency, the Resolution Trust Corp., is charged
with selling or closing hundreds of insolving S&amp;L associations.
   At the time of his resignation, Wall denounced a ``steady stream
of one-sided information'' from congressional hearings on the
collapse of Lincoln. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of
the House Banking Committee, wrapped up his investigation of
Lincoln Tuesday.
   Gonzalez, in a statement, said he was encouraged Bush had named
an acting director but criticized him for waiting so long and for
leaving other regulatory positions vacant.
   ``Leaving a resigned and discredited ... director in office in a
lame-duck status for three months has been extremely poor public
policy that has struck at the heart of the agency's morale,'' he
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Says Soviets May Violate Treaty With Missiles in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States wants early talks with the
Soviet Union on reports that Soviet medium-range missiles remain in
East Germany in apparent violation of the 1987 treaty banning such
weapons, the State Department said Monday.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said the
United States wants to learn if the weapons sighted in East Germany
last week were prohibited SS-23 missiles and missile launchers.
   ``At this point we do not want to speculate on what we may or
may not find,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   ``We expect to discuss this subject with the Soviets at a very
early date,'' she said, adding the time and place have yet to be
set.
   The Washington Times in its Tuesday editions quoted unnamed Bush
administration officials as saying U.S. Army officers traveling
through East Germany photographed six SS-23 launchers and a dozen
missiles.
   The newspaper quoted administration missiles as saying existence
of SS-23 missiles in East Germany would violate the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces, or INF, treaty.
   They said presence of the missiles in East Germany would
complicate negotiations to reduce U.S. and Soviet strategic
intercontinental missiles because new doubts would be raised about
verifying Soviet compliance.
   Under the terms of the treaty the Soviet Union was to dismantle
all of its declared 239 SS-23 launchers and 108 SS-23 missiles.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Army Killing of Schoolgirl</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Thousands of students marched
through the northern port city of Gonaives on Tuesday to protest
the army's killing of an 11-year-old girl during unrest in another
town, radio stations said.
   Most schools were closed in Gonaives, 100 miles north of
Port-au-Prince, according to independent Radio Haiti Inter.
   According to a resident who spoke on condition of anonymity,
more than 5,000 students marched to demand the ouster of Haitian
ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, chanting ``Avril murderer!'' and
``We're fed up with Avril!''
   Roseline Vaval was fatally wounded by a stray bullet Monday as
she sat on her front porch in Petit Goave, about 30 miles southwest
of Port-au-Prince. The bullet was fired by soldiers dispersing a
protest, Haiti Inter said.
   Seven prominent critics of Avril were arrested and forced into
exile in January during a government crackdown on political
opposition. Fifty activists were arrested and allegedly beaten.
   Opposition to Avril has been building since the crackdown. On
Monday, 18 political parties and civic groups joined to demand his
resignation and the establishment of a provisional civilian
government headed by a Supreme Court justice.
   The leftist Confederation of Democratic Unity and five other
small radical groups threatened a ``popular uprising'' unless Avril
resigned.
   Radio Metropole, another independent station, said the Petit
Goave demonstration was to protest the arrest of a youth, but gave
no further details. The town's schools and shops closed during
Monday's protest, in which three people were wounded.
   Avril, who came to power in a September 1988 soldiers' revolt
that ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, has pledged to turn over power
to a civilian government in elections this year. Virtually all
parties and unions have vowed to boycott any elections held under
Avril.
   Namphy had assumed power after a popular uprising forced former
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier to flee to exile in France in 1986.

<HEAD>TMI Officials Begin Plant Shutdown After Leak Detected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant began shutting down the Unit 1 reactor Tuesday after plant
monitors detected higher-than-normal amounts of radioactivity being
vented into the atmosphere.
   State, federal and plant officials said there was no danger to
the public. The releases were not detected by radiation monitors
located off the island, which is about 10 miles south of Harrisburg.
   Also Tuesday, the Unit 3 reactor at the Peach Bottom nuclear
power plant in York County, near the Maryland border, was shut down
because of a mechanical problem with the system's generator,
officials said. Unit 2 had been shut down last week for maintenance.
   GPU Nuclear Corp., which operates TMI, said officials believe
the problem stemmed from a small water leak between the nuclear and
non-nuclear sides of the plant. Under federal license requirements,
TMI must shut down if there is a confirmed leak of more than 6
gallons per hour.
   Although the leak appeared to be at a rate of 1 gallon per
minute, GPU officials said they decided to immediately shut down
the plant instead of going through a process to confirm the actual
rate. The plant could have continued to operate until the leak was
confirmed to be 6 gallons per hour, they said.
   ``The shutdown is a precautionary measure and no emergency
condition exists,'' said Mary Wells, a GPU spokeswoman.
   The higher-than-normal levels of radiation were detected by a
monitor in the plant's steam system. Radiation left the plant
through a vent on that system.
   Doug Bedell, a GPU spokesman, said only a fraction of one
millirem of radiation was released over a three-hour period. He
said a chest X-ray would equal about 10 millirems of radiation. A
millirem is a unit of measurement.
   Karl Abraham, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
said the leak at TMI, at a rate of about 1 gallon per minute, was
detected shortly before 8:30 a.m.
   Workers began shutting the reactor down shortly after 9 a.m.,
plant officials said.
   Susan Woods, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Resources, said the agency had not detected any
above-normal radiation levels off-site.
   ``The plant is going into normal shutdown; they are doing it
manually,'' she said. ``If there was a serious problem, it would
have automatically shut down.''
   The plant had been operating at 75 percent capacity. It was
recently out of service for two months for maintenance and to
replenish its nuclear fuel.
   ``We don't know when it will be up again,'' Bedell said. ``We
need to determine the nature and source of these leaks before we
would consider starting up the plant.''
   TMI 1's sister plant, Unit 2, was the site of the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident, in 1979. A combination of human and
mechanical errors led to the draining of protective cooling water
from the plant's radioactive gases were released into the
atmosphere. Unit 1 was undamaged in the accident.
   A spokesman for Philadelphia Electric Co., which owns Peach
Bottom, did not immediately return a phone call for comment.

   Rain and above-normal temperatures continued
to boost winter wheat prospects in the central and southern Great
Plains, but dry conditions remained in northern areas, the
government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday.
   ``In Kansas, crop condition was good except in the central and
north-central area, where soil moisture was still short,'' the
facility said in its report for Feb. 26-March 4. ``Insect and
disease problems were very light.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of Agriculture and
Commerce. Weekly reports cover wheat and crop conditions but don't
include production forecasts.
   Relatively warm weather and ample moisture supplies hastened
wheat growth in Oklahoma, while the crop's condition was reported
good in Arkansas and fair-to-good in Missouri. Rain also helped the
Texas crop.
   But the report added: ``The northern Great Plains remained dry.
In Nebraska, winter wheat was fair-to-poor. Wind damaged fields in
the northern and western areas.''
   Wheat was ``breaking dormancy'' in eastern and southeastern
areas of Nebraska but were under stress from lack of moisture.
   ``In Montana, winter wheat was fair-to-good,'' the report said.
``Growth was good in California,'' although the numbers of Russian
wheat aphids continued to increase in the Sacramento Valley.
   Crop conditions were reported good-to-fair in Washington, while
in Oregon winter wheat was said to be fair in the east and
good-to-excellent in the western part of the state.
   ``In the Corn Belt and Southeast, winter wheat was fair-to-good,
with adequate moisture supplies,'' the report said. ``The crop was
breaking dormancy in portions of the Corn Belt.''

<HEAD>Mitterrand Tells Dubcek International Accord Needed on Border</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand on Monday told
Czechoslovakia's leading lawmaker, Alexander Dubcek, that an
international accord is needed to assure that a unified Germany
would not seek to regain prewar land.
   A French official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity
said the French president would repeat the position Friday when
Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelkski and Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki make a one-day visit to discuss the issue.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is being criticized
increasingly for refusing to guarantee that the current border
between Poland and East Germany, known as the Oder-Neisse line,
would be kept by a united Germany.
   Kohl says such a commitment can only be made by a united German
parliament, but he appears to be under pressure from rightists who
want to reclaim territory lost to Poland after World War II.
   Dubcek was Czechoslovakia's Communist leader during the ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement of 1968, which Soviet troops crushed. He
returned to public life as speaker of the Federal Assembly late
last year after the peaceful revolution that forced the Communists
to give up their monopoly on power.
   The country replaced its hard-line Communist government with one
acceptable to the opposition and elected former dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel as president.
   Dubcek's two-day visit to Paris continues Tuesday with meetings
with Premier Michel Rocard and National Assembly Speaker Laurent
Fabius and a news conference.
   The French official briefing reporters said Dubcek told
Mitterrand that Czechoslovakia does not oppose German reunification
so long as it takes place in a European framework, and that
Czechoslovakia supports Poland's position on the Oder-Neisse line.
   Polish leaders say they want to be included in international
talks on German reunification that deal with Poland's border.
   Current plans for what are known as ``two-plus-four'' talks call
for East Germany and West Germany to make plans for reunification,
with the victorious World War II powers _ France, Britain, the
United States and the Soviet Union _ taking part on issues with
international consequences.
   Foreign affairs officials from the Germanys will meet next week
to start discussions on reunification, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dieter Genscher told his European Community colleagues Monday
in Brussels, Belgium.
   Irish Foreign Minister Gerard Collins, chairman of the EC
council of ministers, relayed Genscher's announcement to reporters.
   The German minister gave no dates nor locations for the
meetings, Collins said.

   The opposition will have access to state
broadcast media during election campaigns, the National Assembly
announced Tuesday, amid preparations for the first free balloting
in more than four decades.
   Lawmakers adopted a new statute for radio and television, which
is responsible to the legislature and no longer to the government.
But it was unclear whether the measure would grant the broadcast
media more independence.
   In a marked departure from the past, when state radio and
television reflected the official view, the statute specified
``commentaries on radio and television represent the personal
opinion of the commentators.''
   Communists in Bulgaria, unlike those in other Soviet bloc
countries, have retained much of their clout in national politics.
Legislative elections are scheduled for June _ the first after 45
years of hard-line Communist rule.
   The duration of the election messages and other details were to
be included in an electoral law, which was among key legislation
held up by the suspension on Feb. 12 of talks between the ruling
Communists and the opposition. The talks broke down over the
Communists' refusal to agree on key political reforms.
   On Monday, the legislature enacted a law restoring the names of
the 1.5 million ethnic Turks and other Moslems forced to adopt
Bulgarian names in an assimilation campaign authored by the
Communists.
   Legislators said the media statute was modeled after similar
legislation in several West European countries. It stipulates that
``radio and television must be objective. They must not serve one
party or group.''
   According to the new law, the broadcast media will be controlled
by a committee of eight legislators and seven other leaders.
   The heads of state radio and television will be proposed by the
government and elected by the legislature. They cannot hold senior
posts within political parties. Workers in the media are not
entitled to engage in political activity, the statute said.
   The law also stipulated the state council president, the head of
the legislature and the prime minister should be given ``immediate
access to radio and TV on demand.''

   _Local communities must attain federal air quality standards
within five, 10 or 15 years, depending on the severity of the
problem. The Los Angeles area is allowed 20 years.
   _Areas must show annual progress, ozone reductions of 4 percent
a year for the first six years and 3 percent annually thereafter. A
waiver may be granted if the costs of the annual reductions exceed
$5,000 per ton of ozone-forming pollutants.
   Reductions are to be attained through cuts in automobile
emissions and smog-causing releases from industrial plants. Small
business emitting less than 100 tons are exempt.

   _Automakers must reduce tailpipe emissions of smog-causing
pollutants with all cars covered by new emission controls by 1995.
Hydrocarbons _ unburned fuel _ would have to be cut by 22 percent
to 0.25 grams per mile and nitrogen oxides by 60 percent to 0.4
grams.
   A second round of tailpipe controls would go into effect in 2003
cutting emissions another 50 percent if 11 cities now with
``serious'' pollution problems fail to meet air quality standards.
Cities with even more serious problems would have to use
cleaner-burning fuels such as methanol or specially formulated
gasoline.

   _Utilities must reduce in two phases annual sulfur dioxide
emissions by 10 million tons by the year 2000 and cap emissions at
1980 levels at that time. First phase begins in 1995, but utilities
using clean coal technology may delay initial compliance until 1997.
   Dirty plants, primarily in the Midwest, also received extra
pollution control allowances, which may be sold to recoup some of
control costs. Western states also receive additional bonus
allowances to provide cushion for growth.
   _Nitrogen oxide emissions by utilities must be reduced 4 million
tons by year 2005.

<HEAD>Storm Fronts Wreak Havoc On Southern Wyoming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER PETTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A storm moving out of the Rockies and onto the Plains blasted
Wyoming and Colorado with heavy, wet snow Tuesday, closing schools
and hundreds of miles of highway and shutting down the Wyoming
Legislature.
   Wyoming's Laramie Range near Granite Mountain had picked up 3 to
4 feet of snow and some mountain areas in Colorado got up to 2 feet
overnight. Earlier, the storm left 22 inches at Snowbird, Utah.
   Ahead of the advancing snow, freezing rain brought down power
lines in western Nebraska. New Mexico and western South Dakota got
snow and Kansas had strong thunderstorms.
   Jack Daseler, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
Cheyenne, Wyo., described the conditions responsible for the storm
as ``a classic,'' combining an upper level weather system near the
Four Corners area, where Colorado, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico
meet, and a surface system in southeastern Colorado.
   He said that during the night ``the upper and lower system will
coincide over east-central Colorado and sit there for 12 hours.''
   He predicted total accumulations of 15 to 18 inches in Wyoming's
lower elevations. Cheyenne had more than a foot by noon and
Wheatland had 18 inches.
   Pinewood Springs, Colo., in the foothills seven miles southwest
of Loveland reported 24 inches of fresh snow and Buckhorn Mountain
west of Fort Collins received 22 inches. In New Mexico, 9 inches of
snow had fallen by late morning at Chama and Brazos Lodge.
   Heavy snow hampered rescue efforts after a bank explosion at
Crested Butte, Colo., and delayed the arrival of ambulances from
Gunnison, officials said.
   Wyoming legislators decided to take a day off from their budget
session as the snow deepened outside and blowing snow made
buildings just a block away in Cheyenne start to fade out. About
4,000 state employees were told to stay home and at least 400 miles
of interstate highways were closed.
   ``Getting people home tonight is the concern,''said Senate
Majority Leader Diemer True. ``We could get staff and legislators
here, but getting them home tonight is the problem.''
   Neither House Speaker Bill McIlvain, with 18 years in the
Legislature, nor Senate President Russell Zimmer, a 16-year member,
could remember the Legislature ever closing because of the weather.
   Children in Cheyenne and Laramie got the day off, and the
University of Wyoming in Laramie canceled classes at 11 a.m.
   ``They're calling for another foot,'' university spokesman Bill
Young said.
   The University of Wyoming's Cowboys were stranded in Laramie by
road closures that kept them from making their flight from Denver
to the Western Athletic Conference basketball tournament in El
Paso, Texas.
   Rodney Barkell, manager at a 7-Eleven store in Cheyenne, said he
had almost no business. ``What we mostly get right now is walk-ins
_ people that are close enough to where they can walk'' to the
store.
   And some of those who did take their cars may have regretted it.
``We've had a bunch of people stuck in our parking lot,'' he said.
   Barkell added that he was 1{ hours late for work himself and he
only lives a mile away. ``I got stuck trying to get out of my
house, and a friend of mine tried to pull me out and he got stuck,
too,'' Barkell explained.
   The Wyoming Highway Patrol closed some 200 miles of Interstate
80 from the Nebraska line west to Walcott Junction, and about 150
miles of Interstate 25 from the Colorado line north to Orin
Junction.
   The closures piled up business at truck stops in Cheyenne.
   ``We're jammed,'' said Richard Fox, general manager of Little
America in Cheyenne. ``Everything is full. The truck parking lot is
jammed with trucks and all of our motel rooms are rented. We
probably have a couple of hundred people waiting around the coffee
shop and lobby.''
   In northern Colorado, Interstate 25 was closed by heavy snow
from north of Wellington to the Wyoming line. The Colorado State
Patrol also closed Highway 287 from Fort Collins to Laramie, Wyo.
   Denver's Stapleton International Airport reported delays in
arrivals and departures because of visibility problems. Spokesman
Richard Boulware said visibility was reduced to 1,000 feet at one
point in the morning.
   Colorado's Poudre Valley Rural Electric Association spokesman
Larry Graff said a major transmission line and five substations
were down, affecting 3,000 customers north of Fort Collins. Fort
Collins Light and Power also reported some outages in the city,
including radio station KIIX, which was temporarily off the air.

<HEAD>Graffiti Attacks on London Subway Decline after Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An experiment on the London subway to remove
graffiti quickly from trains, stations and other buildings is
producing good results, the system said Tuesday.
   ``We found that attacks increased for a time when the vandals
were faced day after day with clean surfaces, but then the number
of attacks fell away,'' said spokesman John Reed of London
Underground.
   ``We think the vandals get tired of seeing their individual
trademarks cleaned off and can't be bothered to keep going back to
renew their scribbles,'' he said.
   London Underground operates the 237-mile system and its 268
stations which Londoners call the Tube.
   Removing graffiti from trains, stations and other buildings on
the subway costs more than $3.2 million a year and some stations
suffer as many as 700 attacks a month.
   A cleaning company specializing in graffiti removal was hired in
August on a $656,000, one-year contract to work on a group of 15
stations at the northern end of the Metropolitan Line. Its cleaners
aimed to get rid of the daubing within 10 hours of staff reporting
attacks.
   The cleaned surfaces are then treated with easy-to-clean paint
and lacquer.
   Reed said vandals travel from all over Britain and even from
overseas to daub the subway.
   ``Some of them like to show they diced with death by crossing
electrified tracks and climbing up to bridges and other structures
to leave their personal logos,'' Reed said.
   The experiment includes photographing each graffiti attack and
passing details to the Transport Police in an attempt to identify
individual vandals, but that aspect has only just been publicized.
   ``Staff morale at the cleaned-up stations has improved and some
of the staff have asked to restart gardens which used to brighten
up our surface stations. We are also getting letters of thanks from
passengers,'' Reed said.
   Mike Scanes, managing director of the firm with the cleanup
contract, Graffiti Management, said: ``Graffiti is a social problem
which should be tackled by schools and parents. It amazes me that
any parent can let a child play on a Tube line carrying 650 volts.''

<HEAD>GOP Lawmakers Urge Renewal of Drive for Flag-Burning Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Republican lawmakers on Tuesday urged
renewal of the drive for a constitutional amendment to outlaw
burning the American flag, saying the statutory ban passed last
year appears certain to be overturned in the courts.
   ``Maybe it doesn't bother people around here a lot ... but out
there in the real world they're ready for a constitutional
amendment,`` Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., told a news
conference.
   A U.S. district court in the nation's capital ruled Monday that
the statutory ban on burning the American flag approved by Congress
last year is not a constitutional way to limit free speech. A
federal court in Seattle issued a similar ruling last month.
   The Justice Department said Tuesday that it would appeal the
rulings. But the Republican lawmakers said it appeared probable
that the Supreme Court would uphold the decisions and throw out the
statutory ban.
   Congressional sponsors of the measure offered it last year as an
alternative to a constitutional amendment. They said that imposing
the ban with a statute was better than adding restrictions through
changes in the document that guarantees Americans freedom of speech.
   The sponsors sought to avoid language that singled out
protesters.
   Instead, they fashioned what they called a simple, ``content
neutral'' ban on destruction of the flag, which they said had
nothing to do with freedom of speech. They hoped in this way to
survive a court challenge to the legislation.
   The Republican lawmakers reminded the news conference that some
of them had warned last year that the courts would not uphold the
statutory ban. They said Americans will demand a constitutional
amendment to settle the issue once and for all.
   ``I don't think there's anything that's going to get our
American people more excited than a bunch of jerks out there
trampling on the American flag and stamping on it,'' declared Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said support within the Senate is
now sufficient to pass an amendment. Also at the session were Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, as well as Rep.
Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.

<HEAD>Thousands Call for Unity of Czechs, Slovaks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Czechs
and Slovaks rallied to show anger at purported attempts by
Communists to sow discord among the country's two main ethnic
factions.
   ``Some people would like to see Slovaks fighting the Czechs as
another source of conflict,'' Slovak Interior Minister Vladimir
Meciar told the demonstrators in a nationally televised speech.
   ``Gentlemen, your times have gone, and you should go too,''
Meciar said in urging Communist deputies in the Slovak parliament
to resign.
   Slovakia, the eastern part of Czechoslovakia, has traditionally
been a stronghold of orthodox communism, and the new reform
movement that broke the Marxist's hold on the country appears
stronger in the Czech lands and particularly in Prague.
   Czechs outnumber Slovaks approximately two-to-one in the
country, which has a population of about 15.5 million people.
   The National Council, Slovakia's parliament, recently passed a
controversial proposal that would change the country's name to the
``Federation Czecho-Slovakia,'' an attempt to stress the equal
status of both nations within the country.
   The proposal would have to be approved by the federal
Parliament, and passage is unlikely.
   The move was considered by many moderate Slovaks to be an
unnecessary challenge to the Czech part of the country that could
inflame passions between the two groups.
   There have been charges that Communist deputies _ a minority in
the 150-member National Council _ had actively lobbied the majority
independent legislators to support the proposal.
   Jan Buday, leader of the Public Against Violence opposition
group that played the key role in Slovakia's peaceful uprising
against Communist rule, accused Communists of attempting to spread
discord in Slovakia by inflaming historic tensions between Slovaks
and the ethnic Hungarian minority.
   Buday, whose name sounds Hungarian but who says he is a Slovak,
accused the Communists of spreading rumors that he was Hungarian
and trying to impose that group's ethnic interests on Slovaks.
   ``I am first of all a citizen and also a Slovak of the kind who
does not have to be racist or chauvinist,'' Buday said.

   A barge carrying more than 4.2 million
gallons of fuel exploded in flames Tuesday on a waterway plagued by
oil spills this year, and at least one man was injured, the Coast
Guard said.
   The barge, anchored at a Citgo petroleum facility at Linden,
broke into two parts after the explosion and drifted across the
Arthur Kill waterway toward Staten Island, N.Y., officials said.
   Coast Guard officials said the fuel aboard the barge Cibro
Savannah was unleaded gasoline, but Citgo spokesman Kent Young said
the vessel had just finished taking on heating oil. It was unclear
if both materials were on board.
   Young, speaking from the company's headquarters in Tulsa, Okla.,
said the loaded barge had pulled about 150 feet away from the dock
when it exploded shortly before 1 p.m. He said there was a second
explosion about 15 minutes later.
   There was no damage to Citgo land facilities, he said.
   Linden Mayor Paul Werkmeister said two men on board jumped off
when the explosion hit.
   ``The man who jumped off the portside was taken to the hospital
and we know he's in shock,'' the mayor said.
   Donald Wright, the barge's captain, was treated for smoke
inhalation at Rahway Hospital and will be released, said hospital
spokeswoman Nancy Jackson.
   An unidentified woman who answered the telephone at Cibro
Petroleum Inc. in New York confirmed that the barge belonged to the
company, but said she had no details.
   Police blocked off the road to the plant while tugboats and
firefighters on land poured water and foam onto the barge, which
carried 100,500 barrels of gasoline. Each barrel carries 42
gallons, he said.
   ``It shook the world,'' John McCabe, who works at Auchter
Industrial, said as he watched the smoke rise thousands of feet
into the air.
   Ben Francesco, 59, of Staten Island, owner of an auto wrecking
yard about 1,000 yards from the scene, said he and his colleagues
felt the blast.
   The explosion forced the closing of the water channel for the
second time in two months.
   The Arthur Kill and connecting Kill Van Kull separate Staten
Island from New Jersey. This year it has been the scene of oil
spills from a broken pipeline, a punctured barge and broken
barge-loading equipment.
   The heavily industrialized waterway connects to New York Harbor.

   President Bush quoted from slain civil rights
leader Martin Luther King Jr. and the biblical Good Samaritan story
on Tuesday as he urged people to have the courage it takes to serve
their communities.
   Bush told a meeting of the Society of Association Executives
that they should set a goal of 100 percent participation in
community service among their employees and members.
   Expanding on one of his favorite themes, Bush recalled a speech
by King who said serving others often requires courage.
   The Good Samaritan, King told his listeners, helped a stranger
on the road after two other travelers passed him by. ``They didn't
stop because they were afraid,'' of being ambushed by robbers, Bush
recounted.
   The Good Samaritan asked himself what would happen to the man if
he didn't help him, while the other two focused on what would
happen to them if they stopped.
   ``Which question do we ask ourselves,'' Bush said. ``About going
down to the soup kitchen in that dangerous neighborhhod. About
stopping on a dark street to help a homeless man. About reaching
out to those desperate kids ... who have no home life, who're
hooked on drugs, who live a nightmare we can't begin to imagine.
   ``Doing any of these things isn't easy. Every one takes an act
of courage,'' Bush said.

   The American Soviet Youth Orchestra, made up
of 100 talented student musicians from both countries, will make
its second tour of the United States and the Soviet Union this
summer with concert debuts planned in Western Europe.
   The orchestra, a joint venture of the Oberlin College music
conservatory in Ohio and the Moscow State Conservatory, will give
24 concerts in 17 cities in the Soviet Union, Europe and the United
States in July and August.
   The conductors will be Leonard Slatkin, music director of the
St. Louis Symphony, and Alexander Lazarev, artistic director of the
Bolshoi Theater Orchestra in Moscow. Violinist Joshua Bell will
accompany the tour as American soloist.
   S. Frederick Starr, the Oberlin president and founder of the
orchestra, said the $1.3 million cost of the tour will be split
between U.S. and Soviet sponsors. The U.S. share will be financed
mostly by private contributions, he said.
   The orchestra, which made its first tour in 1988, is composed of
50 American and 50 Soviet music students who are selected after
rigorous competitions in both countries. The 1990 tour was
announced during a reception Monday night at the Soviet Embassy.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl dropped his
demand for Polish concessions on a border treaty and moved closer
Tuesday to guaranteeing a united Germany would not claim land ceded
to Poland after World War II.
   His government proposed a parliamentary resolution, to be
introduced Thursday, saying a united Germany should sign a treaty
with Poland declaring that the right of Poles ``to live in secure
borders will not now or in the future be questioned by us Germans.''
   After a Cabinet meeting where ministers discussed disagreements
over his handling of the border issue, Kohl said: ``The things that
burdened us are cleared away.''
   In Warsaw, the Polish Foreign Ministry said there had been
``clear progress,'' but talks were needed about a border treaty.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev welcomed the ``corrections'' in Kohl's
position, the Soviet news agency Tass quoted the Soviet president
as saying after meeting in Moscow with Hans Modrow, the Communist
premier of East Germany.
   Kohl had been criticized for his reluctance to state clearly,
presumably in an effort to preserve the conservative vote in
ecember elections, that a reunified Germany would not question
Poland's western border.
   He had insisted repeatedly that only the leadership of a united
Germany could make such a promise about Polish territory, roughly
one-third of which was part of Germany before the war.
   The chancellor's pronouncements caused unease in Poland, the
Soviet Union, United States and elsewhere as Kohl sought
international support for bringing East and West Germany together
into a single nation.
   His statements also created trouble at home. The Free Democrats,
his coalition partners, joined the opposition Social Democrats in
saying his position jeopardized the chances of unification.
   On Friday, he exacerbated the problem by demanding that any
treaty recognizing Poland's current borders be linked to pledges by
the Poles to honor a 1953 decision to waive any war reparations,
and to a renewal of Poland's 1989 promise to guarantee the rights
of its German minority.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and his Free Democrats
agreed with Poland that Kohl must clarify his position on the
sensitive border issue.
   After a meeting Tuesday between Kohl and Genscher, their second
in two days, Free Democrat official Torsten Wolfgramm said the
chancellor had abandoned his demand that Polish assurances
accompany a border treaty.
   ``It is completely clear,'' he said. ``A treaty would contain
only the border question.''
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, also indicated a treaty
would concern only the border.
   Silesia and East Prussia were awarded to Poland and the Soviet
Union, respectively, at the Potsdam conference of 1945. That led to
the expulsion of 12 million Germans, and at least 2 million died in
the process.
   Genscher was born in what now is East Germany. The foreign
minister has made clear he and his party are willing, in return for
reunification, to give up all claims to the territory lost to
Poland.
   Seiters said the parliamentary resolution would recommend
declarations of respect for Poland's western border by the
parliaments of both Germanys, to be made after the East German
elections March 18.
   Once Germany was united, he said, the government would make a
treaty with Poland guaranteeing its borders.
   Gorbachev warned against any attempt by a reunited Germany to
change borders drawn at the end of World War II.
   ``Naturally, the inviolability of postwar borders is the main
issue in this respect,'' he said in Moscow. ``To use German
reunification to reanimate revanchist plans would be to pursue an
irresponsible policy fraught with very serious consequences.''
   The Bonn newspaper Die Welt quoted President Wojciech Jaruzelski
of Poland as saying prolonging the border debate could ``create an
atmosphere which overshadows everything, and which can complicate
everything positive for our relations.''
   It quoted Jaruzelelski as saying, when asked whether he feared
German reunification: ``Yes and no. I worry as a Pole and European
because of historical experiences. The position of a mighty power,
a dominance, could lead to this position being somehow used at the
cost of others.''
   On the other hand, Jaruzelski said, he believes ``the Germans
themselves, the big powers and all European peoples, especially the
Poles, will do everything so that a united Germany will be a
constructive element in Europe.''
   Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, began World War
II.
   The newspaper telexed excerpts of the interview to other news
organizations in advance of publication, scheduled for Wednesday.

   America's premier spy plane _ the SR-71
Blackbird _ came in from the Cold War after a quarter century of
supersonic snooping, setting a transcontinental speed record
Tuesday before retiring to a museum home.
   In a final fling for the history books, one of the black,
dagger-shaped aircraft flashed from coast to coast in 68 minutes,
17 seconds, arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport
outside the nation's capital to the cheers of hundreds of onlookers.
   The old record was 3 hours, 38 minutes, set in 1963 by a Boeing
707.
   The Blackbird took a running start, refueling over the Pacific
Ocean at 60,000 feet before heading east from the California
coastline and crossing its finish line near Salisbury, Md., said
Malvern Gross, president of the National Aeronatics Association.
The Blackbird then refueled before cruising in to Dulles Airport.
   The flight also set three other speed records certified by the
National Aeronautic Association.
   ``It's bittersweet,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Bruce Liebman, who
flew Blackbirds for the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Beale
Air Force Base, Calif., in the 1970s. ``I'm happy it set the record
but sad that it has been put to bed.''
   ``Bye-bye, Blackbird,'' said Ben Rich, the Lockheed Aeronautical
System Co. executive who helped design the Blackbird: ``I cannot
honestly say this is a happy day for me.''
   The Blackbird model No. 17972 was donated to the Smithsonian
Institution, which plans to display it at a Dulles Airport wing of
the National Air and Space Museum.
   Against overcast skies, the spy plane ended its flight by
dipping as low as 200 feet above the runway as it whistled past an
official greeting gate, balls of fire trailing its huge engines as
the pilot suddenly pointed the pencil-shaped fuselage toward the
heavens.
   It was one of the few public displays of a Blackbird. And
despite the rush to publicize this final run, most details of the
plane's design and capabilities are still top secret. The Air Force
won't even say how many of the planes exist.
   Maj. Suzanne Randle of the Strategic Air Command's headquarters
at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., said nine Blackbirds are going to
museums, three are being mothballed at Palmdale, Calif., and three
will be used by NASA for research. Ms. Randle said she could not
say whether that accounted for all the planes.
   The first flight of a Blackbird was in December 1964. It
regularly flew missions over heavily defended North Vietnam and
provided intelligence in many other regions, including the Middle
East and China. In 1982 its photographs revealed the presence of
Soviet MiG fighters in Nicaragua, touching off an international
dispute.
   The Air Force officially retired the Blackbird fleet in January,
saying they were too expensive to keep in the air despite their
technological prowess. Technological advances also enable
satellites to do similar work more cheaply.
   Critics argue, however, the planes should be kept in service
because they are more versatile than satellites, which are locked
into specific orbits and can take longer to pass over a trouble
spot.
   The Blackbird can outrun the fastest fighters and has never been
shot down in 25 years of spying. It remains the fastest and
highest-flying jet aircraft in the world.
   Built to withstand temperatures of more than 800 degrees
Fahrenheit, its skin is a titanium alloy instead of the aluminum
used on most airplanes. Powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney turbojet
engines, it can sustain a speed of Mach 3, or three times the speed
of sound. Its maximum speed is classified.
   On Tuesday's flight, the plane set separate speed records of
2,153.24 mph between Los Angeles and Washington; 2,242.48 mph
between St. Louis and Cincinnati and 2,200.94 mph between Kansas
City, Mo., and Washington. Sonic booms were reported in various
communities along the flight path as the plane completed its race
across the continent.
   The pilot was Lt. Col. Ed Yeilding, and Lt. Col. J.T. Vida was
the reconnaissance systems officer.
   The decision to scrap the Blackbirds still worries some members
of Congress and clearly irks airmen who flew the secret aircraft on
its 65 million miles of spying.
   ``You might ask, `Why retire it'''? said Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., at the Dulles arrival ceremony. ``This is a very vivid
example of what America will go through to scale back defense
spending.'' Later he added, ``This is one of the first victims'' of
the rush to reduce the military as a result of lessened East-West
tensions.
   The Blackbird's retirement has special meaning for the pilots.
Brig. Gen. Harold ``Buck'' Adams, who flew the same Blackbird on a
record-setting speed run from London to Los Angeles in September
1971, appeared to be fighting back tears as he stood several yards
from the plane in addressing the Dulles crowd.
   ``She is a truly magnificent machine, and she's retiring a
winner,'' he said.

   An aide to President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro of Nicaragua said Tuesday that Contra rebels
based in Honduras told him they are willing to disband, but that no
deadline has been set.
   ``All sides have the good will to achieve demoblization. ... But
we have not come here to demand anything of anybody. We're just
beginning a dialogue,'' said Jaime Cuadra, a representative of Mrs.
Chamorro.
   Cuadra talked with reporters at the Presidential Palace here
after meeting with President Rafael Callejas.
   Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega's leftist
Sandinista party in Nicaragua's national elections Feb. 25, will
take office April 25 for a six-year term.
   The date for demobilization of the U.S.-supported Contra rebels,
estimated at 10,000 in Honduran camps along the Nicaraguan border,
has emerged as a major stumbling block on the way to a peaceful
transfer of power in Nicaragua.
   The Sandinistas, who lost the elections to Chamorros's 14-party
United National Opposition coalition, have demanded the Contras
demobilize before they hand over power to the new administration,
saying that otherwise the ruling party cannot assure a peaceful
transition.
   Contra rebel commanders have insisted they will not disarm or
demobilize until after the transfer of the presidency, the
Sandinista-run army and the Interior Ministry, which controls the
police.
   ``If the Sandinistas don't hand over the army and the Interior
Ministry, they aren't handing over anything. The people rejected
the Sandinistas on Feb. 25, and we will not lay down our arms until
the people's will is respected,'' said a top Contra commander who
called himself only Wilmer.
   Wilmer, who refused to disclose his real name, made the
statement Monday in an interview with The Associated Press at
Yamales, the main Contra camp, 85 miles east of Tegucigalpa.
   Asked about a specific plan for demoblization and a deadline, he
said: ``There is no plan and no established deadline.''
   The United States, which helped form the Contras in the early
1980s and sustained them financially through the decade, said last
week that immediate measures should be taken to achieve the
Contras' demobilization.
   But the State Department also said the rebels must enjoy ``full
guarantees'' regarding personal and economic security at home
before disbanding.
   Honduras has been a reluctant host to the Contras in recent
years. Callejas said last week the rebels should leave as soon as
possible.

   Three people linked to a scheme to use U.S.
soldiers to smuggle cocaine from Panama to this country were
ordered held after appearing before a magistrate, authorities said
Tuesday.
   The soldiers allegedly were hired by Colombian smugglers to
bring cocaine in duffel bags aboard military flights to the United
States, CBS News reported Monday night.
   CBS reported on a smuggling ring broken up recently in Panama.
The network, quoting unidentified military sources, reported that
at least nine people, including two Americans, were arrested.
   The three who appeared before the federal magistrate in Fort
Lauderdale on Monday are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine.
   The three, identified only as John Doe III, John Doe VII and
Jane Doe II, are linked to an investigation of the soldiers,
government sources said on condition of anonymity.
   Federal documents said the cocaine smuggling involving the three
went on from Oct. 1, 1989, to Feb. 19, 1990.
   If convicted, the three could be sentenced to at least 10 years
in prison. Documents related to their court appearance before U.S.
Magistrate Lurana Snow were ordered sealed by the U.S. attorney in
Miami.
   Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office, said
that several sparse documents released Tuesday were the only
information being released.
   A federal official familiar with court policy said it is
allowable in some circumstances to seal documents related to a
court appearance to prevent the release of details of an ongoing
investigation.
   Doug Tillett, a Justice Department spokesman, referred all
questions to the U.S. attorney's office in Miami. A Pentagon
spokesman also declined comment on the case.
   The CBS report said U.S. soldiers took payoffs of up to $10,000
from Colombian drug suppliers to bring cocaine home.
   One serviceman confessed that he recruited soldiers to smuggle
cocaine aboard the flights home, CBS said.

<HEAD>Violence Reported in Jamaican Local Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Beatings, ballot-box thefts at gunpoint
and other irregularities marred local elections in urban areas
Tuesday, but voting was peaceful in the countryside, police and
state radio said.
   Police said a Kingston voter, 32-year-old Robert Anglin, was
attacked by several men and stabbed repeatedly. He was hospitalized
in serious condition.
   Witnesses and the state-owned Jamaican Broacasting Corp. said
thugs beat up a polling station chairwoman at a Kingston grade
school and splashed her with ink, and reported several cases of
hoodlums and gunmen stealing ballot boxes.
   Elsewhere in the capital, toughs invaded polling stations,
intimidated voting officials, marked ballots and stuffed them in
the boxes, witnesses said.
   No reports of irregularities or violence came from rural areas.
   The government deployed 6,500 police and 4,000 soldiers across
this Caribbean island to prevent violence.
   The elections were for 13 city mayors and parish councils. Ten
of the city governments now are controlled by the governing
center-left People's National Party and three by the opposition
Jamaica Labor Party.
   Witnesses and state radio said all ballot boxes were stolen at
the Chetolah Park Primary School and Kingston Parish Church voting
stations in Kingston and ballot boxes were also stolen at three
voting stations in St. Catherine Parish.
   Prime Minister Michael Manley on Monday night urged Jamaicans to
refrain from violence. Elections here traditionally have been
marred by clashes between militants from the two main parties.
   Businesses closed and government offices worked half the day to
allow employees to vote, but polling officials reported a low
turnout.
   Results will be announced this week. Polling hours for the 6,000
voting stations were 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.
   Manley's party campaigned on the platform of decentralization by
promising to turn over certain powers from the central government
to local authorities.
   Manley defeated Labor Party leader Edward Seaga in a lopsided
electoral victory in February 1989.

<TEXT>
   The draft guidelines for conducting the U.S.
Census are ``a cruel joke on American cities,'' New York Mayor
David N. Dinkins said Tuesday in threatening to sue the Commerce
Department.
   ``By issuing these draft guidelines, the Commerce Department has
sent a signal to the Census Bureau that it wants a political
census, not an honest one,'' Dinkins said at a news conference.
   ``But the draft guidelines are a joke _ a cruel joke on
America's cities that depend upon a fair census for political
representation, for a fair share of federal funding, for our
constitutional right to equal protection under the law.''
   If the department has not made some changes when it issues the
final guidelines March 10, ``we'll see them in court,'' Dinkins
said.
   The city is seeking an adjustment to the 1980 census, which it
says undercounted the population by 6 percent, or 450,000 people.
The undercount, it said, lost the city hundreds of millions of
dollars in state and federal aid, based on a population formula,
and curtailed its political representation in Washington and Albany.
   Dinkins' major complaint with the draft guidelines was that
there will be no adjustment unless there is ``overwhelming''
evidence of an undercount.
   ``Even if that evidence is produced, an adjustment would occur
only if it would not be too politically disruptive and the
explanation for it could be `clearly and simply stated in a way
that is understandable to the general public,''' Dinkins said.
   Plus, he said, the draft guidelines make the assumption that the
1990 undercount won't be any worse than the 1980 undercount.
   ``This to me is as bad as the early days of our country when the
government said we will count African-Americans _ slaves _ as
three-fifths of a human being,'' Dinkins said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Tuesday he was unable to judge reports suggesting that American
hostages in Lebanon will be freed soon but added that the existence
of such speculation is encouraging.
   Baker, asked if the administration had reason for optimism about
the hostages, replied, ``I don't know. I mean, you're asking me if
all the smoke out there means there is a fire.''
   He added, ``We certainly hope that the hostages will be
released. We'd like to see anybody that could have influence in
that regard weigh in.''
   Baker commented at the State Department about the latest in a
string of reports in Iranian newspapers, as well as optimistic
assessments by Syrian officials, suggesting that the long hostage
ordeal may be ending.
   The Tehran Times, a newspaper close to Iran's president, said in
an editorial that 1990 would be the last year of captivity for the
hostages.
   The report also said resumption of U.S.-Iranian ties was not a
precondition for the hostages' release.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, commenting on
speculation about the hostages, said, ``I don't know why this many
rumors are out here. I don't have an explanation for that.''
   Baker, asked by reporters if he were encouraged by statements
from Iran, said, ``We don't have any better way of judging that
right now, frankly, than you do. We see what is coming across here,
and we are encouraged by the fact there is speculation. Let's see
if that speculation proves out.''
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``We see a lot of stuff going on.
   ``It's kind of like watching a lot of action under a blanket,''
the official added. ``We're not quite sure who's doing what to
whom.''
   The official said, ``We're hopeful. We don't know enough to be
optimistic.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the
latest Tehran Times report, said, ``It's just pretty hard to judge
it. We certainly hope it's true.''
   Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over Hezbollah,
the umbrella group for radical Shiite Moslems believed to be
holding some of the hostages. Syria is the main power broker in
Lebanon, with 40,000 troops there.
   While saying there is nothing to suggest an imminent release of
the hostages, the administration says there are a lot of talks
going on behind the scenes by officials outside the U.S. government.
   Eighteen Westerners, including eight Americans, are being held
capitive in Lebanon.
   The longest-held hostage is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who will mark his fifth
anniversary in captivity on March 16.
   The Tehran Times, in a second editorial, said said Syrian
President Hafez Assad would visit Tehran soon, after an expected
trip by his foreign minister, Farouk Al-Sharaa. It also denied
reports that a trip by the brother of Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani to the Syrian capital of Damascus last week was related
to the hostage question.
   In Beirut, the respected An-Nahar daily ruled out any hostage
release soon but quoted unidentified Lebanese fundamentalist
sources as saying Iran was prepared to tackle the hostage issue.
   The sources were quoted as saying there had been no direct
contacts between Iran and the United States, but both were scouting
for what was described as a mechanism for releasing the hostages.
The report did not elaborate.
   The Tehran Times, for the second time in as many weeks, said the
hostages should go free without preconditions. In the past, the
paper has reflected the thinking of President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   ``Our own assessment indicates that this thorny issue can be
sorted out in the near future in a sincere spirit by sincere
people,'' the paper said, adding, ``1990 can and will be the last
year of the captivity of these hostages.''
   It said an effort was under way to free the hostages because
``Islam in no way allows or condones the idea that people should be
taken or held hostage.''

<HEAD>Junk Dealer Appears Before Federal Grand Jury</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A junk dealer appeared Tuesday before a
federal grand jury investigating a series of mail bombings in the
South that killed two people.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, of Enterprise, and his attorney, Paul
Harden of Evergreen, did not disclose the nature or extent of any
testimony.
   The federal grand jury that convened in Birmingham last week is
investigating the mail bombings that killed federal appeals court
Judge Robert S. Vance of Birmingham and lawyer Robert Robinson of
Savannah, Ga., in December.
   Vance was killed by an exploding package at his home on Dec. 16.
Two days later, a similar mail bomb killed Robert Robinson, an
NAACP attorney who served as a city councilman in Savannah, Ga. Two
other bombs were spotted and defused, one at 11th Circuit offices
in Atltanta, the other at NAACP offices in Jacksonville, Fla.
   A source familiar with the case told The Associated Press that
the grand jury may not be conducting a full investigation but may
compile testimony for use later, possibly by another grand jury.
   O'Ferrell said Monday he had not been subpoenaed to appear
before a grand jury, but that he had discussed testifying with his
attorney.
   FBI special agent Tom Moore said he was prohibited from
commenting on any grand jury proceedings concerning O'Ferrell.
   The special grand jury handles cases investigated by the
Organized Crime-Drug Enforcement Task Force, and federal
prosecutors assigned to the task force in Birmingham have been
working the mail-bomb investigation, officials have said.
   O'Ferrell came under scrutiny after investigators discovered
that the type in letters he wrote years ago to Vance's court, the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, appeared to match
the type in letters linked to the mail bombs.
   More than 100 investigators flocked into Coffee County and began
searches of O'Ferrell's New Brockton home and Enterprise business
on Jan. 22. They dug up his septic tank and sent divers into a
nearby lake to look for possible evidence.
   Investigators found several typewriters in the salvage store but
none that had type matching the letters, according to federal
agents.
   O'Ferrell speculated he could have had the typewriter and used
it to type his letters but then sold it to an unknown buyer.

<HEAD>Baker Urges Israel To Accept Proposal For Talks With Palestinians</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged
the Israeli government on Tuesday to approve his terms for talks
with Palestinian Arabs or run the risk of a dead end in Mideast
peace efforts.
   ``Without a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians we can
never move forward to peace,'' Baker said as the two leading
political parties in Israel clashed over his formula for talks.
   ``They are trying to resolve some fairly thorny problems that
they have within their government,'' Baker told reporters. ``I
think they are working hard and in good faith to resolve those
problems and we certainly hope they are successful.''
   Baker stopped just short of involving himself in the political
dispute in Israel over his terms for the talks. But he left no
doubt about the outcome he seeks from Jerusalem.
   ``What we would like to see is for them to give us a positive
answer so that we can move forward toward a dialogue between
Israelis and Palestinians,'' Baker said.
   The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler,
meanwhile stressed that Baker would continue to press for Israelis
and Palestinians to meet in Cairo.
   ``He will stay engaged as long as there is hope, as long as
there are genuine efforts on the part of all parties,'' she said.
``And he today sees no reason to give up that hope or to
disengage.''
   On Monday in Jerusalem, leaders of the Likud coalition, headed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, voted to send an Israeli team to
Cairo for talks with Palestinian delegates, but only if East
Jerusalem Arabs were excluded from negotiations.
   Also, the Likud leaders said they would quit the talks if the
Palestine Liberation Organization tried to direct the discussions.
   This raised the possibility of a breakup of the government's
ruling Likud-Labor coalition. Labor, the junior member, had
threatened to walk out unless U.S. terms for negotiations were
accepted by Wednesday.
   The Bush administration sought to avoid involvement in the
dispute.
   ``We are not going to have a comment on that,'' spokeswoman
Tutwiler said of the Likud moves. ``That is an area which we have
refrained from getting into.''
   The U.S. official read from a prepared statement that skirted
the current political dispute by saying the Bush administration
wanted a decision from the Israeli government itself.
   ``We posed questions to the government of Israel, and we have
not yet received an answer from the Israeli government,''
spokeswoman Tutwiler said. ``Positive answers to the questions will
make it possible to go forward.''
   She acknowledged Israel was facing a dilemma. The U.S. proposal
is known to call for placing on the delegation at least one
Palestinian deported from the West Bank during the insurrection
against Israeli control.
   ``We have said these are very difficult decisions,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``We understand that.''
   But in expressing U.S. pressure, she said `'the ball is in
Israel's court'' and ``the time to act is now.''

   The House Banking Committee closed its
investigation of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and mapped
plans Tuesday to broaden its probe to include spectacular thrift
failures in Texas, Colorado and Florida.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, promised anew to examine the
failure of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of
Denver. President Bush's son, Neil, served on the thrift's board.
Regulators have said the younger Bush had questionable business
ties to Silverado borrowers.
   The committee will hold a March 26 hearing on the failure of
CenTrust Savings Bank of Miami. A month ago, CenTrust became the
first S&amp;L to fail because of junk bond losses. It was also known
for spending deposits on a museum-quality art collection, lavish
salaries, a yacht and limousines.
   On May 2-3, the committee will look at Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. and what Gonzalez called a ``daisy chain'' operation in which
junk bonds were shuffled around the country among institutions _
including Lincoln, Silverado and CenTrust.
   Gonzalez plans field hearings April 11-12 in Dallas to examine
thrift collapses in Texas. He said he hoped to subpoena the former
executives of Vernon Savings and Loan Association and Sunbelt
Federal Savings and Loan Association.
   The panel will also look at the government's 1988 bailout sale
of American Savings and Loan Association, Stockton, Calif., to
Texas financier Robert Bass, Gonzalez said.
   Tuesday's hearing, the seventh by the committee focusing on
Lincoln, scrutinized the web of interlocking land deals involving
Hidden Valley and Estrella, which were to be a massive residential
developments in the desert 20 miles southwest of Phoenix.
   Chris Seefer, an examiner in the Office of Thrift Supervision's
San Francisco office, complained that political appointees in the
agency's Washington headquarters blocked field examiners from
scrutinizing the projects, after meeting with Lincoln owner Charles
Keating Jr. in September 1987. He estimated that caused $200
million of Lincoln's $2 billion loss.
   Gonzalez had invited Charles H. Keating III, son of Lincoln's
owner, to testify, but he did not appear.
   The younger Keating, while still in his 20s, drew a $1 million
annual salary from Lincoln's parent company, American Continental
Corp., for handling many of his father's real estate ventures.
   ``The absence says much about the cavalier attitude'' of the
Keatings, Gonzalez said. He had intended to subpoena the younger
Keating, but had not been able to gather the majority of his
51-member committee needed to vote on the action.
   For the most part, the hearing covered old ground, examining a
land deal between Lincoln and Ernest C. Garcia, a Tucson developer
and stockbroker. Lincoln was able to manufacture profits by lending
Garcia $19.6 million, which was never repaid.
   Garcia used the money to buy the Hidden Valley land through a
straw buyer, Fernando R. Acosta.
   The transaction has been examined in detail in public hearings
before U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin, who is to decide
on a motion to dismiss Keating's lawsuit seeking to reclaim
Lincoln. The S&amp;L was seized by the government in April.
   Garcia, who had been subpoenaed by the committee, appeared but
refused to answer questions, asserting his constitutional right to
avoid self-incrimination.
   Acosta testified briefly, saying he acted as a straw buyer in
the Hidden Valley sale as a favor to Garcia and did not consider
his actions improper. He disclosed he had been questioned by the
FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission about the transaction.
   Gonzalez told reporters his committee would release its report
on the Lincoln failure soon, possibly in a week.

   In addition to regular news reports on Tuesday's
events in Afghanistan, the English-language service of the official
news agency Tass carried this dispatch, which was not presented as
a commentary:
   Serious concern is caused by fighting between separate units of
the government forces, also with the use of aviation, that broke
out in Kabul on March 6. At a time when national reconciliation is
gaining momentum and the prospects for a political settlement to
the Afghan conflict have become more tangible, an attempt has been
made to stage an armed coup against Afghanistan's lawful government.
   These actions can blight the hopes for an early establishment of
peace in Afghanistan.
   Soviet people who are sincerely interested in the well-being of
the Afghan people and who wish that there should be no more loss of
life in neighboring Afghanistan, our friend, cannot remain
indifferent to the events in Afghanistan. It is noted with
satisfaction that the government takes vigorous steps to normalize
the situation.
   What is needed above all in this hour of trial for the Afghan
people is unity of all patriotic forces to protect Afghanistan's
national interests and the resolve to prevent developments that may
lead to tragedy.
   People in the Soviet Union are confident that the road to a
future peaceful and prosperous Afghan state is through national
reconciliation and the ensurance of Afghanistan's independence and
sovereignty. This road is favored in the Soviet Union and
throughout the world.

   The town meeting had all the makings of a
low-budget soap opera: a bitter, 12-year feud between families, a
battle over selling booze and a question about who should govern.
   First and foremost, voters went to the polls Tuesday to decide
whether the town's only general store, M.H. Sherman's _ owned by
Marion and John Pelton _ should be allowed to continue selling beer
and wine.
   A rejection could force residents to travel six miles or more to
buy beer and wine, making Rupert one of only six dry towns in
Vermont. Rupert, which borders New York in southern Vermont, was a
dry town until voters narrowly approved the sale of beer and wine
in 1981.
   Rupert is not the only New England community grappling with
change.
   In Vernon, neighbors of Vermont's only nuclear power plant voted
Monday to support a low-level radioactive waste site near the
plant. Vermont is the only state with a nuclear power plant that
has no place to put its low-level radiactive nuclear waste.
   In addition, voters in many Vermont towns were asked whether
they support asking the state's congressional delegation to back a
5 percent cut in defense spending and redirect it to domestic needs.
   In the coastal Maine town of Penobscot, residents considered a
plan Tuesday to abolish local property taxes and finance town
services instead through voluntary payments and user fees. The
town's budget is $1.2 million a year.
   In Rupert, with a population just over 600, many feel the real
issue on the ballot has more to do with the local family feud than
the issue of wet versus dry.
   ``It's really just a grudge match,'' said Rupert Selectman Jay
Wilson, Jr., adding that the feud began about 12 years ago when
John Pelton charged that Wilson's son, now town road commissioner,
and several of his friends were taking gasoline from the town
garage for personal use.
   Wilson, who has served on the board of selectmen for 32 years,
and some of his family have reportedly not been in Pelton's store
since then.
   Wilson also is struggling to keep his seat on the Board of
Select. He is being challenged by Dan Nardi, who supports keeping
the alcohol laws intact.
   The battle over alcohol sales in town has been contentious, with
Wilson accusing Pelton of selling alcohol to minors (which Pelton
denies), and a recent selectmen's meeting erupting into a fist
fight over the issue.
   ``It's Wilson again Pelton,'' said one resident, who asked not
to be identified. Added another, ``We've got a lot of `family'
problems around here.''
   Pelton is not the only one feuding with the Wilson clan. Edward
Lewis says his road is the last to get plowed by the road
commissioner, Wilson's son, after every snowstorm because he has
challenged the elder Wilson for the selectman's seat several times.
   Rev. Paul Mychack, of the Church of Christ, says some residents
have ``been against me mindlessly'' because he took another of
Wilson's sons to court 11 years ago.
   ``It's unbelievable how divided the town is,'' said Mychack.
``I'm so upset about the violence. Before this is over, I'm afraid
someone will get hurt.''
   M.H. Sherman's, located two doors down from the post office, is
an unlikely battle field. The small store is crammed with
everything from Blue Seal livestock feed to disposable diapers and
displays a bulletin board touting an upcoming chicken and biscuit
dinner to benefit the fire department.
   ``This is a nice store ... it's almost like a community center
here,'' said Andrea Lenhardt, a clerk at Sherman's. ``When the
power goes out in town, the first place people come to is this
place.''
   Lenhardt echoes her bosses' denials that they sell beer and wine
to minors. ``We are very careful, especially if it is someone we
don't know. Sometimes we tell people don't even take it (beer or
wine) out of the cabinet unless they have i.d.''
   But some residents, including Wilson's daughter-in-law Lisa,
complain that too often residents gather at the store not to mingle
with neighbors, but to get drunk.
   ``You get more obnoxious people,'' said Lisa Wilson. ``They sit
at the store and get drunk and hassle people.''
   Traditionally the first Tuesday in March, Rupert's town meeting
allows residents to decide issues crucial _ often whether to buy a
new snow plow or raise selectmen's salaries _ with a show of hands.
State offices and schools are closed for the day.

<HEAD>East German Parliament Approves Strike Right</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday adopted a labor law
that recognizes the right to strike for the first time in East
Germany's 40-year history, while forbidding employers from locking
out workers.
   The embrace of one capitalist tactic and rejection of another
highlights the indecision gripping East Germans as they begin
considering how to merge their nation with West Germany.
   Members of Parliament praised the new labor code that mixes
market-style reforms with traditional socialist protections, but
conceded it probably will stir protest among West German investors
and employers eyeing unification.
   The labor law easily won approval from the 385 lawmakers present
for what is expected to be the last session of the 500-member
People's Chamber prior to the nation's first competitive elections
on March 18. Only six voted against the measure, with 53
abstentions. Debate was minimal.
   The future of the new labor law may rest with the new,
400-member Parliament. Many labor principles embodied in the law
require implementing legislation that will have to be tackled after
the new legislative body is seated.
   The strike clause, however, is among changes to take effect next
week.
   Lawmakers hailed the no-lockout clause as a workers' right not
enjoyed in West Germany.
   Because the law is likely to be seen as imbalanced by West
German industries seeking to build plants or engage in joint
production operations in East Germany, it may serve to slow the
investment considered essential to turning around the flagging
economy.
   The law comes in the form of a constitutional change. It permits
unions to call strikes if arbitration fails to resolve
labor-management differences in negotiations.
   Strikes have been forbidden in East Germany and most socialist
states. Labor unions traditionally were powerless to challenge
policies handed down by Communist authorities, who dominated all
social and economic matters until last fall.
   The government now will have the right to intercede and stop a
strike only if the walkout is deemed a threat to public well-being.
   The law provides that ``no one can reduce or hinder unions in
their rightful occupation.''
   Communist lawmaker Kaethe Niederkirchner said such a broad
protection was likely to disturb the capitalists next door. He
quoted West German employers association president Klaus Murmann as
describing the law as a ``hindrance'' to inter-German economic
cooperation.
   Parliament also adopted additional measures on election
procedures, including extending voting rights to foreigners who
have lived in East Germany for two years or more.

<HEAD>Gourmet Brownie Company Sues Bakery Goliath</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gourmet brownie maker is claiming in a federal
lawsuit it was burned by a 71-year-old baking giant in Minnesota
that allegedly stole a recipe and sold it under a new name.
   The Boston Brownie Co. alleges McGlynn Bakeries of Eden Prairie,
Minn., took the batter recipes for Boston Brownies and marketed
them, with a few minor changes, under the name Classic Brownie
Batter. McGlynn denies the allegations.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit filed last last month cites an
agreement between the two companies in which McGlynn would
manufacture the batter for Boston Brownie, and for its own store in
Minneapolis. The agreement said the recipes were a trade secret and
that McGlynn would protect them, the lawsuit contends.
   Boston Brownies, which has one store in the Faneuil Hall
marketplace, makes ``gourmet brownies'' in 20 flavors. In addition
to the traditional fudge and fudge nut varieties, offerings include
rocky road, mint, toffee, amaretto, kahlua, white chocolate
macadamia nut and chocolate chip.
   ``It's my recipe, my process, my logo, and all of that,'' said
Laura J. Katleman, the owner and inventor of Boston Brownie, which
has sales of about $400,000 annually.
   The Classic Brownie Batters, which McGlynn has marketed for
about two years, also come in flavors such as rocky road, toffee,
mint and amaretto, as well as chocolate, chocolate pecan, cherry,
white chocolate chunk, and blond chocolate chip.
   ``Have you ever heard of amaretto brownies? Where did he get
those flavors?'' Katleman asked Monday. What's more, she said,
``the fudginess, the ingredients, they read the same as mine. My
chemist says for McGlynn to have come up with these formulas it
would have been a miracle.''
   Katleman said she was appalled by what she called McGlynn's lack
of honor in allegedly fudging things so her brownies were sold
under his name. McGlynn Bakeries is run by Michael J. McGlynn.
   What made her particularly angry, she said, was ``the way he
wooed me. He invited me to his home, I met his family. He was so
warm and sweet, and to find out he was doing this.
   ``Maybe I am naive about the workings of big business, but his
conduct in this whole matter was just appalling to me.''
   Sales at McGlynn, which has retail bakeries and manufactures
frozen dough and pre-baked foods, totaled about $100 million in
1989, McGlynn said in a telephone interview. He said the sales from
Classic Batter Brownies comprised ``less than one-quarter of one
percent'' of total business.
   McGlynn declined to comment on any aspect of the suit, but a
lawyer for McGlynn Bakeries, Jim Harlow, said the company denied
all of the suit's allegations.
   ``We think the allegations of the complaint are groundless and
the company intends to vigorously defend against them,'' said
Harlow, who declined further comment.
   Katleman said McGlynn first approached her after he had sampled
some of her brownies on a pass through Faneuil Hall.
   ``He was just enamored of the whole concept of gourmet
brownies,'' said Katleman.
   McGlynn wanted to lease the Boston Brownies recipe for franchise
stores, but they could not agree on terms, Katleman said. Instead,
they agreed to have him manufacture her batter, of which she needs
``a couple of thousand pounds a week,'' she said.
   Last December, Katleman discovered the Classic Brownie Batters
in a McGlynn catalogue, which she saw in the offices of another
batter maker.
   ``The guy started to read down the list, Chocolate Amaretto,
Rocky Road, and he asked me `Are you sure he hasn't ripped you
off?' I was just blown away,'' Katleman said.
   The lawsuit seeks to restrain McGlynn from any use of Boston
Brownies batter, recipes, products, formulas and processes. It also
seeks damages, but Katleman said she could not name a specific
amount.

<TEXT>
   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt said
Tuesday the United States should offer direct aid to the Soviet
Union to ensure that its reforms succeed.
   ``We should be investing in our own self-interest,'' Gephardt
said. ``And stability, democracy and a market economy in the Soviet
Union are in America's strong self-interest.''
   The proposal brought immediate criticism from some quarters, and
a presidential spokesman said the Soviets don't want direct aid.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., also said that the Soviets haven't
requested U.S. help and that, if they did, it would be wasted
without economic reform. ``Unless they reform the economy, it's
going down a rathole,'' Bradley said.
   Others on Capitol Hill said that while they thought Gephardt's
proposal would spark a useful debate, the idea would fall on
disapproving public ears.
   ``If you're going to start giving foreign aid to the hated
commies of 70 years' worth, you've got a real sales job to do in
the United States,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   ``Gorbachev needs us a lot more than we need him,'' said Senate
Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``We ought to extract a fair
price'' for any support, including a requirement that the Soviets
stop aiding client states from Cuba to Afghanistan.
   ``If Gorbachev needs some ready cash, he can ask for a refund
from Castro'' and the others, Dole said in a speech released by his
office.
   Gephardt noted an appeal by Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel,
in a Feb. 21 speech to Congress, to help his country by helping the
Soviet Union continue on its reformist road.
   If Havel, who was imprisoned by the communists, can call for aid
to the Soviets, ``the least we can do is listen,'' Gephardt said in
a speech that also contained his harshest criticism to date of
Bush's policy toward Eastern Europe.
   He accused Bush of ``a lack of leadership in this most crucial
moment,'' throwing billions of dollars into the military budget to
defend against ``communists who don't want to be communists any
more'' while ignoring their economic needs.
   ``It's as though George Bush's Pentagon budget were written by
someone who hadn't read a newspaper in a year,'' Gephardt said,
drawing applause. Indeed, most of the administration's budget was
drafted last year, after the opening of the Berlin Wall but before
many other dramatic developments in Eastern Europe.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the
charges ``general old political stuff'' and added, ``The Soviet
Union doesn't want direct aid.''
   But others, while saying the Soviet Union should have to meet
certain conditions before receiving U.S. help, acknowledged that
events have moved so rapidly that aid is no longer out of the
question.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he agreed with Gephardt.
``It's a dramatically different circumstance from a few months
ago,'' Foley said, noting local elections that have taken place in
the Soviet Union and the existence of competing political parties.
   ``Those changes are coming on very fast, and we have a stake in
this country in supporting those changes,'' Foley said.
   Gephardt, a 1988 candidate for the Democratic presidential
nomination, proposed the idea of direct aid in a speech to the
liberal Center for National Policy and acknowledged that it would
be difficult politically.
   ``There are votes to be lost in taking a risk for peace, in
appearing insufficiently tough on the Soviets. And there are votes
to be lost in calling on the American people to make some changes
to adapt to the changing world,'' the Missouri congressman said.
   Speaking to reporters later, Gephardt added:
   ``We live in a paradox. We now face the prospect of giving
assistance and support to people who've oppressed people for 45
years.''
   But he said that during a trip to Eastern Europe two months ago
``I was embarrassed that we are not being as strong and as
courageous as they are. Can't we do something to help?''
   Specifically, Gephardt called for a ``Food for Freedom'' program
to send U.S. food aid to the Soviets; the lifting of trade
restrictions, including those on high-technology exports, and
guarantees for businesses that want to invest in the Soviet Union.
   ``A stronger Soviet economy will facilitate the process of
peace,'' said Gephardt. ``How can the Soviets pull Red Army troops
out of Eastern Europe if they have no jobs and no homes for them to
return to in Russia?''
   Direct U.S. aid is possible now because ``the Cold War as we
have known it for four decades is over,'' Gephardt said. While the
possibility remains that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
could be ousted or his reforms could fail, superpower competition
in arms and influence has changed in fundamental ways, he said.
   The United States since May 1985 has sold 20 million metric tons
of U.S.-grown wheat to the Soviet Union under subsidies worth
hundreds of millions of dollars, but has never provided direct aid
of the kind Gephardt proposed.
   Some of Gephardt's colleagues also questioned the propriety of
the suggestion and his motives.
   ``He's got the burning bosom syndrome to be president of the
United States,'' Simpson said.
   ``Of course there's a major question of how we react to the
startling developments in the Soviet Union,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill. ``But Mr. Gorbachev has got to stop subsidizing their
imperial designs regionally around the world. Let him tell Mr.
Castro he's on his own'' in Cuba.
   ``Then they might be entitled to look to us for concrete
assistance,'' Hyde said. He added, ``I know Mr. Gephardt is anxious
to make a mark for himself, but we should speak with one voice on
these very delicate questions.''

<HEAD>Romanian Exile Leader Says Chances of Free Elections Are Nil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Romanian exile leader told Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and members of Parliament Tuesday that chances of
free elections in Romania are nil because Communists control the
government, media and economy.
   Ion Ratiu said the National Salvation Front has taken over the
old Communist Party structure and is using it to help win the May
20 general election. The front took power in the December
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ratiu, 72, who arrived from Bucharest Tuesday and planned to
return Wednesday, is president of the World Union of Free
Romanians. He was granted asylum in Britain in 1940 and became a
wealthy businessman. He now hopes to run for Parliament in Romania
as a candidate of the National Peasants Party, the largest
opposition group.
   After meeting Mrs. Thatcher, he told an all-party meeting at the
House of Commons that the Western news media and Western embassies
in Romania were perpetuating the view that the opposition parties
``are incapable of producing a coherent government.''
   Ratiu said many of the 47 political parties formed since the
revolution ``are phantom parties subservient to the front.''
   He said that nonetheless, if free and unfettered elections were
held and the result was a plurality for the opposition, a coalition
of non-front parties ``would form a government that is very
credible and very capable.''
   Ratiu said he doubted there will be free elections.
   ``In the country, at large, the entire structure of the
Communist Party, with small exceptions, is now active as the front.
The chances of free, fair and unfettered elections are nil under
these circumstances,'' he said.
   ``Effectively, the front still has control of the media, economy
and the government infrastructure and all its members have a vested
self-interest in victory for the front party.''
   Ratiu chided French President Francois Mitterrand and Premier
Michel Rocard for receiving Prime Minister Petre Roman and not
arranging a single ministerial meeting for Corneliu Coposu,
president of the Peasants Party who has been in Paris this week.
   ``I do not wish to see the front recognized as a legitimate
government,'' he said.
   Ratiu said Romania's interim President Ion Iliescu agreed last
week to allow the World Union of Free Romanians to publish an
independent newspaper and new radio and television stations.
   A printing press will be delivered next week and Ratiu said he
expects to start publication in two weeks. Equipment for the TV
channel is in Bucharest and ``we can start it at once, within two
days,'' he said.
   He said the exile group would send 100 tons of paper to Romania
for the election campaign, and it would be offered equally to all
parties, including the front.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Tuesday the
reunification of Germany should proceed slowly and NATO membership
for the new nation was ``absolutely out of the question.''
   Gorbachev spoke after meeting with Hans Modrow, the Communist
premier of East Germany. His remarks were carried by Tass, the
official news agency.
   President Bush and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said
last week they had agreed a united Germany should be part of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Soviet Union, which has
more than 300,000 soldiers in East Germany, has said the new
country should be neutral.
   Tass said Gorbachev was asked Tuesday what he thought of a
United Germany becoming part of NATO and replied: ``We cannot agree
to that. It is absolutely out of the question.''
   Modrow's spokesman, Wolfgang Meyer, said East Germany also found
NATO membership unacceptable.
   A ``step-by-step'' approach to reunification is needed,
Gorbachev said, and condemned what he called tendencies to treat
the process ``high-handedly.''
   Modrow's talks in Moscow also concerned future relations. East
Germany is the Soviet Union's main trading partner.

   All nations in the former Soviet bloc
except Romania will have trade agreements with the European
Community by the end of April, a senior official of the community
said Tuesday.
   Frans Andriessen, commissioner for trade and foreign affairs,
said accords with East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia would
be concluded before the EC summit on Eastern Europe is held April
28 in Dublin, Ireland.
   Agreements were signed in 1988 and 1989 with Hungary, Poland and
the Soviet Union. The scope of an agreement Czechoslovakia signed
in 1988 is being widened.
   Andriessen said the ``first generation'' agreements would be a
basis for more extensive commercial relations. He said a pact could
not be signed with Romania because its government was more of a
caretaker administration than the others.
   ``Second generation'' agreements to be negotiated later are
intended to be ``a model ... we can use for the construction of a
greater Europe,'' Andriessen said.
   The official said those agreements would deal with establishing
a free trade zone, political cooperation, common projects in
sectors such as transport and the environment and financial deals
like a $1.2 billion loan arranged for Hungary.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force is paying for a $100,000
study to determine how low-flying F-4 Phantom fighter jets may
affect the health and behavior of pregnant horses kept near
military bases.
   Simulated bursts of jet noise will reverberate through barns for
nine months to determine their effect on eight pregnant,
thoroughbred and saddlebred horses, researchers at the University
of Florida said Monday.
   Another control group of eight pregnant mares will not be
exposed to the flyover din.
   ``Heavily pregnant mares may be more susceptible to the stress
of aircraft noise,'' said Dr. Michelle LeBlanc, a veterinarian.
``One of the common complaints the Air Force receives is that
abortions seem to occur more often in mares subjected to low-flying
aircraft.''
   LeBlanc, associate professor at the University of Florida's
Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, said about 50 studies
on the effects of aircraft noise on animals have been conducted
since the arrival of sonic boom in the 1950s.
   ``But because many studies weren't considered scientifically
valid, the Air Force sought additional research with domestic
animals,'' she said.
   The study is funded by the Air Force's unit of noise and sonic
boom impact technology, she said.
   ``The reason for the research on domestic animals is to provide
data on general and potential damage claims incurred by the Air
Force as a result of farm or ranch overflights,'' said Maj. Michael
Thompson, project manager of Air Force studies on sonic booms.
   LeBlanc said stress may affect the quantity and quality of
antibodies produced in the mares' first milk, or the ability of
foals to absorb the antibodies.
   ``Foals rely on these antibodies for protection against
infectious diseases during the first few weeks of life, and they're
only capable of absorbing these antibodies during their first 18
hours of life,'' she said.
   Each randomly timed noise burst will last three seconds,
increasing about 50 decibels per second until it peaks at 120
decibels, comparable to the noise of a jackhammer, she said.
   Ultrasound will be used in monitoring the horses' heart activity
and fetal movement, while video cameras record behavioral reactions
to the sounds.
   LeBlanc aims to pinpoint the threshold of noise that prompts a
frightened horse to bolt. The Air Force could use that information
to determine when their aircraft should fly higher to diffuse the
noise, she said.
   ``The horses in the study might get a little upset over the jet
sounds at first, but they should adjust to it quickly,'' LeBlanc
said.
   Next year, with the help of real Air Force jets, LeBlanc will
continue the study using authentic flyover experiments, she said.

   Guerrillas opened fire on a
military helicopter Tuesday, killing a soldier and wounding nine of
the people aboard, including four Salvadoran journalists, the army
reported.
   Solicitor General Mauricio Eduardo Colorado was in the U.S.-made
UH1H helicopter but was not hurt, an army news release said.
Leftist rebels riddled the chopper with automatic weapons fire in
Chalatenango, a northern province.
   Colorado was returning from Guancorita, a small town 55 miles
north of San Salvador, where he investigated allegations that the
air force had bombed and strafed the area, killing or wounding many
civilians.
   The helicopter pilot and co-pilot, Capt. Sergio Calix Molina and
Lt. Douglas Tochez Artiga, were wounded but managed to land in
Guarjilla village and the wounded were taken to a San Salvador
hospital, the army said.
   It did not identify the dead soldier or the other wounded.
   The journalists were identified as Samuel Arias, a television
reporter for TCS Noticias; his cameraman, Manuel Diaz, and sound
man, William Madrid, and Antolin de Jesus Herrera, a photographer
for the newspaper Diario de Hoy.
   One of the journalists was in serious condition, the army said,

<HEAD>`60 Minutes,' With Andy Rooney Back, Returns to Top 10</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sparked by the return of suspended
commentator Andy Rooney, ``60 Minutes'' jumped to fourth place last
week in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, according to figures released
Tuesday.
   Helped by Walter Matthau's first appearance in a television
movie and the Miss USA beauty pageant, CBS finished in second place
for the week.
   But it was the re-emergence of ``60 Minutes'' _ beaten the week
before by an hour's worth of ``America's Funniest Home Videos''
repeats _ that was probably the best news for the struggling
network.
   Sunday's broadcast, in which Rooney discussed his abbreviated
suspension and denied he was a bigot, had a 22 rating, easily
beating ABC's competing ``Life Goes On.''
   That series had an 8.9 rating, trailed by NBC's Disney movie
hour, which averaged an 8.3 rating. Each ratings point represents
921,000 homes.
   On Feb. 8, Rooney was suspended for three months without pay
after a gay-oriented magazine quoted him as making a racial slur.
He denied he said it. CBS News president David Burke lifted
Rooney's suspension Thursday.
   The ratings of ``60 Minutes'' slipped during Rooney's three-week
absence, and the program on Feb. 25 dropped to 18th place in the
ratings.
   For the week, NBC was first with an average prime-time rating of
14.4 to CBS' 13.1 and ABC's 12.4
   Here are the Top 10 shows: ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; ``America's
Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC; ``A Different World,'' NBC; ``CBS
Sunday Movie _ The Incident,'' CBS; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC;
``Empty Nest,'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC.
   ``The Incident'' starred Matthau as a small-town lawyer who
defends a Nazi prisoner of war charged with murder. ``The 1990 Miss
USA Pageant'' was No. 20 for the week with a 15.9 rating.
   On the other end, ABC's ``H.E.L.P.,'' about an elite rescue
squad of New York, premiered at No. 79 for its Saturday, 8 p.m.
time slot. ``Nasty Boys,'' in its second week for NBC, was tied for
52nd place with ABC's ``Elvis.''
   ABC captured first place among the evening news shows for the
eighth week in a row. Peter Jennings' ``World News Tonight'' had an
average rating of 11.1, Tom Brokaw's ``NBC Nightly News'' was 9.8,
and Dan Rather's ``CBS Evening News'' was 9.7.
   An NBC News special, ``A Day In the Life of the White House,''
featuring interviews with President and first lady Barbara Bush,
was No. 62 with a 10.0 rating for Wednesday night.
   A repeat of ``The Simpsons'' was No. 36 and the highest rated
Fox show for last week.

   A missing prosecution witness in the trial of
seven young whites accused of killing a black teen-ager who
ventured into their predominantly white neighborhood surrendered
Monday in Ohio.
   The witness, John S. Vento, gave himself up to FBI agents in
Dayton, said Paul Mallett, who heads the bureau's operations in
southern Ohio.
   Vento, who had been missing since December, is a key witness in
the slaying of Yusuf Hawkins, 16, who was surrounded by a group of
30 whites and shot to death Aug. 23 when he went to the Bensonhurst
section of Brooklyn to look at a used car.
   The FBI last week issued an arrest warrant for Vento as a
material witness in the case.
   Earlier Monday, the trial judge reluctantly agreed to delay the
start of proceedings until April 2 to give prosecutors time to
locate Vento.
   The prosecution will have Vento held as a material witness and
ready to testify in time for the April 2 trial ordered by Judge
Thaddeus Owens, said Pat Clark, a spokesman for the Brooklyn
District Attorney.
   Seven young white men are charged in the slaying _ six with
second-degree murder and one with first-degree assault.
   Joseph Fama, 19, accused of firing the fatal shot, is in
custody; the other defendants are free on bail.

   A pair of pet pigs found themselves in
the pokey for promenading down a street and stopping the traffic.
   Police took four hours to round up the pigs, and a goat that
joined them, and took them to the pound Monday after officials at
Homestead Elementary School complained they were blocking traffic.
   Officer Terry Simpson said she decided to rein in the trio
because owner Marge Lampert had been ticketed a dozen times for
failing to control her animals, and allegedly had not paid up.
   Lampert, an equipment operator at Elmendorf Air Force Base, said
she bought the pigs at a state fair last year and her children
named the cute and cuddly things Joseph and Miss Piggy. Now that
they're grown, they've become too hard to hold, she said.
   ``I had hoped to confine them well and let the kids in the
neighborhood experience farm animals without offending anyone,''
she said. ``I seem to have offended everyone.
   ``I'm not a real organized person, so sometimes I get more than
I can handle,'' she said.
   She also owns four dogs, a cat and 15 tropical birds.

   Yelena Bonner, widow of Andrei Sakharov, said
Tuesday the Soviet action against ethnic unrest in the Caucasus
cost more lives than the Chinese army crackdown on pro-democracy
protesters in June.
   She is visiting Rome as a guest of the Socialist Party and
commented during a news conference at party headquarters.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev will go down in history ``not as the father
of perestroika, but as the instigator of genocide,'' Bonner said.
   Trouble began between the neighboring Caucasus republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan two years ago over Nagorno-Karabakh, an
enclave in Azerbaijan whose population is predominantly Armenian.
   Soviet troops stormed Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, on Jan.
13 to stop ethnic fighting, and Soviet officials say more than 170
people died in the crackdown. Bonner did not say how many people
she believed were killed.
   Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of demonstrators were killed in
June when the Chinese army crushed pro-democracy demonstrators in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Bonner also criticized Gorbachev's political reforms, suggesting
the mass of Soviet people had lost faith in their president. ``I
say this with sadness and regret,'' she said.
   Sakharov, a physicist largely responsible for the Soviet
hydrogen bomb, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 because of his
long campaign for human rights. He died in December.

<HEAD>State Permits Human Testing For AIDS Vaccine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human testing of a potential AIDS
vaccine was approved Monday by state health officials, but
researchers cautioned that development of a true vaccine will take
years.
   The approval was the first for human trials of HGP-30 in the
United States, according to the companies that developed the drug.
   Clinical trials will be held at San Francisco General Hospital
and the University of Southern California Medical Center in Los
Angeles, said Dr. James Kahn, who will conduct the San Francisco
tests. The trials will begin in two to three months, he said.
   ``This is just a very preliminary stage,'' said Kahn, who called
HGP-30 a ``candidate'' vaccine. ``It's the first step, but it's not
something that's going to cure AIDS, and it is not intended as a
cure or treatment for AIDS.''
   The trials were approved by the state Department of Health
Services' Food and Drug Branch, said Tom Hazlet of the branch.
   In the tests, 24 healthy people who test negative for human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, will receive
escalating doses of HGP-30 and be monitored for at least a year.
   Doctors will try to determine the vaccine's toxicity and see if
it causes the body to produce antibodies to the virus, Kahn said.
   Another potential vaccine for the incurable disease is being
tested at the National Cancer Institute in Washington, D.C., Kahn
said.
   Experts in the field say tests of a potential vaccine for an
AIDS-like disease in monkeys also shows promise for the development
of a treatment that could prevent AIDS in humans.
   HGP-30 targets for destruction a core protein of HIV. The
vaccine is designed to trigger antibodies to the protein, which is
found in all strains of the AIDS virus, according to Alpha 1
Biomedical Inc. of Washington and CEL-SCI Corp. of Alexandria, Va.,
which developed the vaccine.
   HGP-30 is the first potential vaccine to be tested in humans
where the active component is a completely synthetic molecule, the
companies said in a news release.
   Because the vaccine lacks live or dead virus, there is no chance
that HGP-30 could cause AIDS infection, the companies said.
   Kahn, assistant professor of medicine at the University of
California-San Francisco and a member of the AIDS-Oncology Division
at the university-affiliated San Francisco General, said most
researchers believe it will be five to 10 years before an effective
AIDS vaccine is developed.
   By the end of last month, the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had recorded a cumulative total of 121,645 cases
of AIDS in the United States, with 72,580 deaths, or 60 percent of
all cases.

   Outgoing President Daniel Ortega
criticized the United States and Honduras on Tuesday for failing to
help demobilize the Contra rebels.
   ``Why has the government of the United States delayed ordering
the transfer of humanitarian funds to the United Nations or the
Organization of American States to speed up demobilization and
repatriation of the Contras?'' Ortega said in a speech.
   ``Why is Honduras delaying a decision to expel the Contras from
its territory?'' he said.
   There are an estimated 4,000 Contras inside Nicaragua and
thousands more in camps in southern Honduras, just across the
border from Nicaragua.
   Ortega, whose leftist Sandinista government has been fighting
the U.S.-supported Contra rebels during eight of its 10{ years in
power, spoke before U.S. and Latin American publishers at a meeting
of the Inter American Press Association.
   Also on Tuesday, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who defeated
Ortega in elections Feb. 25, traveled to the Costa Rican city of
Liberia for talks with President Oscar Arias.
   It was her first trip abroad since she was elected, and she
praised Arias for a plan he devised in 1987 that earned him the
Nobel Peace Prize and eventually led to the Nicaraguan elections.
   Mrs. Chamorro asked Arias to endorse her proposal that Central
America declared a demilitarized zone.
   ``I want your valued support, as winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize, for my proposal that the presidents of Central America sign
an agreement declaring Central America demilitarized, to be signed
by the six countries of the isthmus and endorsed by all Latin
American countries,'' she said.
   The Sandinistas have recently taken a harder line against the
Contras, saying they will not permit the dismantling of the
Sandinista Army unless the Contras are demobilized before Chamorro
takes office April 25 for a six-year term.
   But Contra leaders have balked at the idea of breaking up their
forces immediately, saying they will hand over their weapons to
Mrs. Chamorro's government only after it takes office to ensure
they won't be harassed by the Sandinista military.
   The government declared a ceasefire following the elections, but
Contra groups have been moving among the population in several
towns in the interior and there were firefights this week with the
Sandinista Army near the northern city of Matagalpa.
   ``The strengthening of the democratic process in Nicaragua will
depend on the maturity of the U.S. government, of those who govern
and those who are governed here, and on the attitude of the
government of Honduras,'' Ortega said.
   Ortega urged the United States to assume a ``responsible
attitude,'' and accused the Contras of being ``bent on revenge.''
   ``They think the time has come to collect dues, to chop heads,''
he said.
   As one of his last acts in office, Ortega said he was sending a
bill to the national assembly abolishing a decade-old news
censorship law that will also permit the establishment of private
television stations _ both by the Sandinistas and sympathizers of
the 14-party coalition headed by Mrs. Chamorro, the United National
Opposition.
   On Monday, Ortega had warned of renewed fighting if Chamorro's
government enrolls former guardsmen or Contra rebels in Nicaragua's
armed forces, controlled by Sandinista militants.
   ``A national war will break out,'' said Ortega at a rally of
hundreds of students in Managua inaugurating the scholastic year.
   Both Ortega and Mrs. Chamorros have been calling on the Contras
to disband immediately. The United States has also urged such
demobilization, saying the little nonlethal aid it now provides
them is about to end.
   In Tegucigalpa, Honduras, Foreign Minister Mario Carias Zapata
on Tuesday said repatriation talks were continuing.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge accused of using his office
to do favors for convicted felons testified Tuesday that he lied
when he told a lawyer he had disclosed a wiretap to its target.
   In his second day on the stand, U.S. District Court Judge Robert
Aguilar also accused a series of prosecution witnesses of lying or
being mistaken in saying they had held conversations or meetings
with him.
   The witnesses included a former lover, a former secretary, a
friend who was secretly cooperating with the FBI and a deputy U.S.
marshal.
   The judge denied every accusation against him: that he had tried
to influence criminal cases by approaching fellow judges; that he
helped his former secretary remain a fugitive; that he twice
disclosed a wiretap to its target; that he lied to the FBI; and
that he told a witness to lie to a grand jury.
   Aguilar, 58, of San Jose, is charged with eight felonies,
including a charge that he used his office as a ``racketeering
enterprise'' to obstruct justice, the first such accusation against
a federal judge.
   A judge since 1980, he faces a prison sentence of up to 55 years
if convicted. He also could be removed from office by Congress,
regardless of the verdict.
   In asserting that he had lied in the past, Aguilar was seeking
to defuse potentially damaging prosecution evidence: a secretly
made tape recording of a luncheon meeting in which he said he had
relayed word to Abe Chapman, an elderly relative by marriage, that
he was being wiretapped.
   Aguilar is charged with twice revealing the tap to Chapman, in
August 1987 and February 1988. On Monday, he denied knowing that
Chapman was being wiretapped.
   But in May 1988, attorney Ed Solomon, a friend and former
classmate of Aguilar's, agreed with the FBI to wear a tape recorder
to two meetings with the judge. On one of the tapes, Aguilar said
he had relayed word to Chapman about a wiretap so that he would
call on pay phones in the future.
   That ``was not a true statement,'' Aguilar testified Tuesday.
   ``I was bragging to Ed Solomon ... trying to make him feel
better,'' the judge said, recalling that Solomon had appeared
distraught about an FBI investigation. ``What I've said here under
oath was absolutely the truth.''
   Aguilar also testified about his involvement in the case of Rudy
Tham, a former Teamsters leader who was represented by Solomon in
seeking a new trial on a 1980 embezzlement conviction.
   Aguilar testified that he and Solomon had never discussed Tham's
case.
   Aguilar is accused of trying to influence U.S. District Judge
Stanley Weigel to rule favorably in the case. The prosecution
contends he told Solomon to lie to the grand jury about their
discussions on the case, and that he lied when he denied to the FBI
that he had discussed the case with Solomon.
   ``I have never discussed the Tham case with Ed Solomon, never
discussed the merits of the case,'' Aguilar said. He said their
conversations involved only procedural aspects of the case, such as
how to file a motion for a hearing.

   The pool of prospective jurors for John
Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial grew to 35 Tuesday, including a
woman who campaigned for Jesse Jackson and another familiar enough
with the case to know former President Reagan had refused to turn
over his personal diary.
   Eleven people were disqualified, including a retired CIA
research analyst who conceded the agency had made mistakes, ``but
not very many.''
   On the second day of the jury selection process, U.S. District
Court Judge Harold Greene said, ``I think we can do with 45
people'' before proceeding with choosing a panel of 12 jurors and
six alternates. He said he expects to fill the pool by midday
Wednesday and have opening statements on Thursday morning.
   Of the 35 accepted so far, 27 are women and eight men.
   Under questioning by the judge, the secretary who has campaigned
for Jackson said she could be impartial, adding that she had once
sent a get-well card to Nancy Reagan when she was sick.
   An employee at the University of the District of Columbia, she
had seen Poindexter aide Oliver North on television testifying
about shredding documents.
   ``I knew he (North) had a secretary and she sneaked out with
documents on her person,'' said the woman. But she added that she
``wasn't familiar with Mr. Poindexter.''
   A bridal consultant who became part of the jury pool said she
recalled that Poindexter was North's boss, but little else.
   She said she heard that Reagan had refused to turn over to
Poindexter his ``diary or private letter book and a video was
offered instead.''
   Reagan's videotaped testimony taken Feb. 16-17 will be shown at
Poindexter's trial, said Richard Beckler, lawyer for Reagan's
former national security adviser. Reagan and the Bush
administration invoked executive privilege in refusing to turn over
36 of Reagan's diary excerpts to Poindexter. Greene is expected to
rule on the question at some point.
   Also sent into the jury pool was a retired Defense Department
employee who got the Watergate scandal mixed up with the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The prospective juror, a woman who worked at the Army Materiel
Command in Alexandria, Va., said Oliver North's trial last year was
``abot the tapes. He had so many tapes he did erase, Oliver North
and secretary.''
   During Watergate, then-President Nixon's secretary Rose Mary
Woods said she might have accidentally erased a portion of one
taped conversation. The tape in question was of a conversation
between Nixon with his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, about how to
handle the spreading FBI investigation of the Watergate scandal.
   Disqualified from the pool was a retired CIA research analyst
who spent 25 years at the agency and said she didn't want to
discuss her work. She said she has ``no firm opinions about''
whether ``right and wrong'' was done in the Iran-Contra affair.
   Asked whether she could be impartial if there was evidence at
the trial that the CIA had done something wrong, the woman said,
``The CIA has made mistakes'' over the years, ``but not very many.''
   Another potential juror was disqualified after saying she
thought Poindexter had been involved in ``doing something that he
shouldn't have done.''
   ``I didn't think it was right; in fact, I knew it wasn't,'' said
the woman, a retiree who had worked for the U.S. Air Force.
   Poindexter's low public profile, compared with keen public
awareness of North, is making it a relatively simple task to select
a jury for Poindexter's trial. It took more than a week to select a
jury last year for North's trial because so many prospective jurors
were familiar with testimony he had given Congress in 1987 under a
grant of immunity from prosecution.
   Poindexter is under indictment on charges of conspiracy, two
counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements. The charges relate to allegations that Poindexter's
covered up North's secret resupply network to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua and to allegations that Poindexter's lied concerning a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk antiaircraft missiles to Iran.

<TEXT>
   In votes without precedent in U.N. history, two
reform-minded East European countries sided with Western
delegations on resolutions dealing with the human rights situation
in Cuba and China.
   A U.S.-initiated measure critical of practices under President
Fidel Castro was passed 19-12 in the U.N. Human Rights Commission,
with Hungary and Bulgaria among those voting in favor while the
Soviet Union cast a dissenting ballot.
   Poland and Czechoslovakia, attending as non-voting observers,
added to the Havana government's isolation by co-sponsoring the
text introduced by U.S. chief delegate Armando Valladares, a former
Cuban political prisoner,
   Hungary and Bulgaria also joined the West in opposing a proposal
by Pakistan that no action be taken on a mildly worded resolution
on China. The resolution included a guarded reference to last
June's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing.
   However, the Pakistani motion narrowly carried, the result of
intensive Chinese lobbying among Third World members of the
43-nation organization.
   The U.S. resolution on Cuba had been gradually softened
following consultation with other Western delegations. Valladares
hailed its approval as a ``victory for the fight for human rights
around the world.''
   It expresses ``concern'' at reports that witnesses who testified
before commission members visiting Cuba on an unprecedented
fact-finding mission in 1988 were subsequently subject to arrest,
harassment and other reprisals.
   Cuba is called upon to honor its guarantees not to take any
action against these witnesses and to provide the commission ``with
a response to unanswered questions'' put to the Cuban authorities
by mission members.
   The resolution asks U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar to provide the commission with results of contacts he
promised to maintain with Cuba on the issue.
   The 1988 mission, which had been invited by Cuba, compiled a
largely noncommittal report listing allegations of gross violations
together with denials by Havana and claims of a clean record.
   Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Raul Roa Kouri, addressing the
commission before the rollcall vote, said the resolution was
``totally unacceptable.''
   He branded it ``yet another U.S. attempt to obtain through
pressure what it could not obtain through aggression by
mercenaries, terrorist infiltration, murder attempts on our leaders
and economic blockade.''
   Valladares told reporters that Cuba now would have to give
comprehensive answers to questions on basic freedoms, as well as to
allegations of torture and other abuses involving hundreds of
people.
   He said the U.S. move obtained a majority because ``no one wants
to be associated with Cuba'' after what happened to Nicolae
Ceausescu, the Romanian Communist dictator who was overthrown and
executed last December.
   ``Romania could happen all over again in Cuba, but even worse,''
he said. ``I am very optimistic, I think the days of Latin
America's last dictatorship are numbered.''
   Czechoslovakia's Zdenek Pagac told the meeting before the vote
that some may call his country's support for the resolution a
``historic moment but our position is not surprising.''
   He said defense of human rights was ``free of ideological
aspects'' under the new Prague government, which is led by
non-Communists. The Soviet delegate limited his comment to voicing
regret at ``politicizing'' the issue.
   At Tuesday's session, U.S. Ambassador Morris B. Abram denounced
a 15-year-old General Assembly resolution equating Zionism to
racism as a ``disgrace'' and urged it be scrapped.
   He told the commission Zionism ``has been a model for all
honorable national liberation movements'' and said Zionism and
racism are ``total contradictions.''
   Abram, who has held high posts in American Jewish organizations,
said the sponsors of the 1975 resolution tried to ``classify ...
Jewry and the Jewish state as infected with criminality, and thus
to replay Hitler's themes'' that led to the Holocaust.
   ``The United Nations was founded in the wake of the defeat of
Hitler's crimes. It would be an awful twist of history if the
United Nations became the executor of Hitler's prophecy,'' Abram
said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Organization of American States will keep
a team of observers in Nicaragua until Violeta Chamorro takes over
as president from Daniel Ortega on April 25, OAS Secretary-General
Joao Baena Soares said Tuesday.
   Baena Soares praised Nicaraguan political parties for their
cooperation with OAS observers in the country's Feb. 25 election
and reported to the organization that results were ``within what
the OAS polls anticipated.''
   A preliminary report by Nicaragua's Electoral Council gave
Chamorro 55.2 per cent of the votes against 40.8 for President
Daniel Ortega, the standardbearer of the Sandinista Front.
   Baena Soares told the OAS Permanent Council that the 31-nation
organization had sent 433 observers to 4,391 polling places as part
of a highly sophisticated system of on-the-spot checks and computer
tabulation that included an electric power plant to be use in case
of a black out in public services.
   The OAS team, the largest to verify the election, ``received the
full cooperation of all the Nicaraguan competing parties and all
nations of the hemisphere, which provided us with realiable
specialists in each aspect on an electoral process,'' he said.
   The OAS team is being scaled down to about 50 until the transfer
of power, he added.
   Baena Soares said the information he gave to the OAS Council
will be follow up by a more detailed, written report.
   The OAS, in a joint operation with the United Nations, also is
pushing for the dismantling of the U.S.-backed Contras, which have
been resisting mobilization.
   The peace process supported by the OAS called for both free
elections and the dismantling of the Contras.

   A partnership of the nation's largest
corporations used an endangered tax credit last year to invest $77
million in low-income housing for 2,000 families, advocates of the
tax break said Tuesday.
   That investment was used by non-profit, community-based
corporations as a lever to start providing $200 million in rental
housing in 15 cities, the National Equity Fund said. The fund
invested the money, which came from 35 corporations.
   Representatives of the Chicago-based fund were joined at a news
conference by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, Sen.
John Danforth, R-Mo., and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   Mitchell and Danforth have introduced legislation to make the
Low Income Housing Tax Credit permanent. Rangel is a sponsor and
prime mover behind the original legislation in the House.
   ``Tax policy has had a negative effect by and large in the
1980s,'' said Danforth, referring to the impact of tax-policy on
low-income housing programs. ``It's time to turn it around.''
   The credit was made part of the 1986 tax reform. It was extended
last year was extended to the end of 1990. The Bush administration
has proposed adding another year.
   NEF is an affiliate of the Local Initiatives Support
Corporation, a private, non-profit group dedicated to community
development. The LISC was created by the Ford Foundation in 1979.
   The first partnership created under the auspices of NEF invested
$14.25 million from 13 corporations to create 857 units of housing.
NEF said it raised $51 million from 40 corporations last year to
develop over 2,000 units of housing worth over $150 million.
   According to NEF, the credit creates 100,000 units of low-income
housing each year. The credits are awarded over 10 years.
   The 1989 fund covers projects in Boston; Cincinnati; Hartford,
Conn.; Healdsburg, Ca.; Indianapolis; Kalamazoo, Mich.; Kansas
City, Mo.; Los Angeles; Miami; Minneapolis; Newark, N.J.; New York;
Philadelphia; Raleigh, N.C.; and St. Paul, Minn.

<HEAD>Protests Disrupt Council Meetings in England; 21 Arrests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested 21 anti-tax demonstrators outside
a community council meeting in Bristol on Tuesday, and protests
brought council business to a halt in Norwich and Maidenhead.
   Councils deliberating their assessments under the new community
tax also were disrupted in Bradford, Birmingham, Exeter and
Worcester, according to Press Association, Britain's domestic news
agency.
   Four constables were injured during five hours of protests in
Bristol, police said. Scuffles broke out as the crowd learned that
the council had set one of the highest taxes in England.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government introduced the new
tax, which is assessed against every adult, to replace the property
tax. The tax is intended to make it clear to voters whether their
local council members are frugal spenders.
   The average English household will pay $280 more under the new
tax than under the property tax, an increase from $837 to $1,112,
British Broadcasting Corp. radio reported Tuesday.
   However, the charges vary widely from community to community.
   ``The lesson will be learned that it is the Labor (opposition
party) authorities which are the high spenders and it is the
Conservative ones which look after their constituents,'' Mrs.
Thatcher told the House of Commons on Tuesday.
   However, Mrs. Thatcher's popularity has suffered because of the
new tax and many people have joined the revolt.
   The council in Norwich abandoned its meeting when about 200
people in the public gallery shouted abuse, tossed rubbish and tore
up council agendas. ``The council chamber looked like it had been
covered in snow,'' said council member Chris Wright.
   An estimated 2,000 demonstrators outside chanted ``No Poll Tax''
and ``Thatcher Out.''
   It is called a poll tax after a tax levied on individuals in the
Middle Ages.
   The Maidenhead council also halted its meeting when a crowd of
about 700 stormed the building. Police reported two arrests.
   At least 40 protesters forced their way into a reception area,
and television coverage showed them flinging documents out the
windows.
   ``It is a night for the people. We have occupied the council
chamber,'' said Graham Roberts, leader of the Maidenhead Against
the Poll Tax group. ``The tumbrels of the people are coming to
sweep them away.''
   In the northern city of Birmingham, a Conservative party council
member and two teen-age aides held doors shut to keep demonstrators
out, according to Press Association. There were no arrests.
   Hand-clapping protesters disrupted a hearing in Bradford, where
teachers also walked out Tuesday to protest spending cuts made to
keep taxes down.

   Vice Premier Shimon Peres on Tuesday threatened
to bring down the government unless Israel's Cabinet gives
immediate approval to U.S. proposals for starting a dialogue with
Palestinians.
   The decision-making inner Cabinet is scheduled to meet
Wednesday, with Peres' center-left Labor Party and Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc still at odds over the U.S.
plan.
   Peres read an ultimatum after a 45-minute meeting of Labor
Cabinet ministers at his office in Tel Aviv. He demanded a Cabinet
meeting to decide whether to accept the plan, which the parties
have been squabbling over since October.
   ``Labor ministers demand ... a discussion and decision on a
positive answer to the questions U.S. Secretary of State (James A.
Baker III) presented to Israel,'' it said.
   Peres told reporters he would consider a tie vote in the inner
Cabinet, which has six members of each party, as a negative
response that would ``bring an end to the government.''
   ``We demand a vote and a decision tomorrow,'' he said.
   Baker urged Israel to approve his terms for talks or run the
risk of coming to a dead end in Mideast peace efforts.
   He told reporters in Washington on Tuesday, ``Without a dialogue
between Israelis and Palestinians we can never move forward to
peace.''
   Baker said he believed Israel was ``working hard and in good
faith to resolve those problems and we certainly hope they are
successful.''
   In an interview on Israel Television, Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens of Likud declined to say if the issue would come to a vote
Wednesday or even be discussed.
   But he said in an Israel radio interview, ``I don't see any
reason for dismantling the government. I think, I hope and I expect
that we can unite around the positions presented by Likud
ministers.''
   Baker has presented proposals aimed at meeting Palestinian
demands that exiled Palestinians and Arabs from east Jerusalem be
eligible for the negotiating team sent to Cairo.
   The key issue is Likud's refusal to accept any Palestinian who
lives in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, home to 140,000
Palestinians. Shamir claims such respresentation would threaten
Israel's claim to sovereignty over the unified city.
   The PLO has demanded that east Jerusalem be the capital of an
independent Palestinian state.
   On Monday, Likud demanded that Labor approve its call for the
exclusion of all east Jerusalem residents. It also insisted on
Labor's support in abandoning the talks if the PLO was found to be
involved in negotiations in any way.
   Labor's statement Tuesday reaffirmed the party's commitment to
``the status of Jerusalem as the sovereign and united capital of
Israel,'' and stressed that ``in accordance with the government's
guidelines, Israel will not conduct negotiations with the PLO.''
   But the ministers said they ``completely reject any attempt by
Likud'' to deviate from the original May 14, 1989, peace plan,
which made no mention of barring East Jerusalem residents.
   In calling for a showdown, Peres was backed by Labor's No. 2
man, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose hawkish views are often
closer to Shamir's positions.
   Labor said it would convene a meeting of its Cabinet ministers
immediately after the inner Cabinet session Wednesday. A decision
to leave the government would have to be approved by the party's
bureau and then by the meeting of its central committee, set for
March 15.
   If the Cabinet approves the Baker proposals, the United States
would be expected to invite the foreign ministers of Israel and
Egypt for a meeting to prepare for the Cairo talks.
   Among the outstanding tasks would be naming a Palestinian
delegation, a contentious issue since Palestinians insist that the
PLO pick the negotiators.
   The Cairo meeting would discuss Israel's plan for elections in
the occupied territories, the scene of the Arab uprising in which
659 Palestinians and 43 Israelis have been killed since December
1987. Palestinians would be elected to negotiate a limited autonomy
scheme for their 1.7 million brethren in the occupied lands.
   Both ideas are a compromise with Palestinian demands for a clear
PLO role in peace talks and an independent state in the occupied
territories with east Jerusalem as its capital.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Tuesday that he
and six members of his new Cabinet had received more than $300,000
in donations from Recruit Co., the information service conglomerate
at the center of an influence-peddling scandal.
   ``All of these donations had been received before the Recruit
Co. became the target of public criticism,'' Kaifu said during
questioning by opposition legislators in Parliament. ``They present
no problem in terms of the (governing Liberal Democratic) Party's
internal standards, either.''
   Last spring, two prime ministers resigned over their ties to the
company, and a major election loss by the ruling Liberal
Democratics was blamed in part on voters upset with politicians'
receipt of funds from Recruit.
   Three Cabinet members also resigned who were linked to the
scandal, and the party's senior leaders were forced to adopt a low
profile, clearing the way for the rise of Kaifu, who came to office
with a clean image and promises of political reforms.
   Kaifu told a Socialist Party questioner that seven ministers in
his Cabinet, formed last Tuesday, had received a total of $325,300
in donations from Recruit, which has been accused of trying to buy
influence, mainly with sales of cut-price stock to influential
politicians and businessmen.
   Kaifu listed himself as the largest recipient, with $96,000,
followed by Director General of the National Land Agency Moriyoshi
Sato, who had received $93,300.
   Donations to Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto, Finance
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Labor Minister Shunpei Tsukahara,
Transport Minister Akira Oho and Director General of the Hokkaido
and Okinawa Development Agencies Tamisuke Sunada ranged from $4,000
to $59,300, he said.
   Sakamonto told a news conference all the donations were legal.
   ``Our party decided last year that we did not have to disclose
ordinary political donations and the purchase of fund-raising party
tickets,'' he said. ``As long as no one was asked to give favors
nor has given any, I think they should be treated as ordinary
donations.''
   Kaifu had sought to keep politicians linked to the Recruit case
or other scandals out of his administration. In forming his new
Cabinet, after his party's Feb. 18 election victory, he showed
unexpected assertiveness in resisting pressure from party elders to
give Cabinet posts to two such men.
   In connection with the stock deals, which involved shares not
yet offered for public sale, 12 politicians, public officials and
Recruit executives have been indicted on bribery charges.

   President Bush and Italian Prime Minister
Giulio Andreotti on Tuesday discussed the emerging new order in
Europe and reaffirmed that the German-Polish border and all current
borders must be respected.
   Andreotti, who has urged a larger role for all the NATO allies
in discussions leading to German unification, hailed what he called
``the dawn of democracy in Eastern Europe.''
   ``New balances lie on the horizon, full of promise, yet also
fraught with problems,'' the Italian leader said after Bush
welcomed him to the White House with military honors.
   ``By updating and reviving the spirit and the model of NATO and
Helsinki, we must all together seize the challenges that are facing
us,'' Andreotti said.
   Bush said the United States and Italy agree ``on the foundations
of a new Europe'' and look to the 35-nation Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe ``to play a greater role in Europe's
future, particularly in guiding the economic and political
transformation of the rising democracies in Eastern Europe.''
   Later, the White House announced the United States had accepted
a West German proposal for a ``two-plus-four'' meeting of
sub-cabinet officials to discuss procedures for more substantive
talks on German unification. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
meeting may be held March 14 in Bonn, but that the date and
location were not definite.
   The two-plus-four are the two Germanys and the four Allied
powers that defeated Nazi Germany in World War II _ the United
States, Great Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
   The two-plus-four formula, agreed to by the four powers'
ministers in Ottawa last month, has stirred concern in Rome and
other capitals left out of the equation.
   Andreotti told Italian reporters after his White House talks
that established institutions such as NATO should not be replaced
by what he called a ``directorate.'' He said he favors convening
the 16-nation NATO alliance before its customary meeting in May.
   A spokesman for Andreotti, Pio Mastrobuoni, said Bush assured
the prime minister that the aim of the four powers' meeting would
be to put an end to their special rights over Germany.
   Asked by a reporter at the outset of the Oval Office talks with
Bush whether the two-plus-four formula gave Italy a sufficient
voice in German unification, Andreotti said:
   ``It's not a problem which belongs to Italy. I think that all
the member countries of the Atlantic alliance must handle together
these problems.
   ``The specific problems related to Berlin must be handled by the
four countries'' that won World War II, he said.
   The State Department said the two-plus-four formula would not be
expanded to include Italy, Poland or any of the other smaller
countries.
   Raymond Seitz, the assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian affairs, told reporters that Bush and Andreotti
``discusssed the question of borders and the need in an emerging
European order that all borders are accepted.''
   Seitz said Bush made ``abundantly clear ... that the
two-plus-four mechanism is not regarded in any fashion as a
substitute for a legitimate discussion of alliance concerns in
NATO.''
   Andreotti had lunch with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
at the State Department and later returned to the White House for a
black-tie state dinner, where Bush said, ``I can think of no time
in modern history when our strong transatlantic partnership was
more crucial.''
   Andreotti, toasting Bush in return, called for ``a new
solidarity ... between the United States and Europe.'' He
reiterated his call for ``a broader framework for cooperation''
based upon the Helsinki formula and NATO to deal with a Europe
where ``ideological and military confrontations wane.''
   He was to address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday and
receive an honorary degree from Catholic University before
departing Thursday for Latin America and stops in the Dominican
Republic, Chile, Argentina and Brazil.
   Andreotti became prime minister in July for the sixth time,
leading Italy's 49th postwar government. Italy will assume the
presidency of the 12-nation European Community this July.
   Andreotti said in Rome last week that he did not fear that a
united Germany would turn belligerent, but was concerned that
interest rates could be driven up when West Germany tries to help
East German development.
   Andreotti also met with U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, shelved a resolution calling on Germany to
stick to its present borders, saying the rush of events made it
unnecessary.
   In Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government moved
to still the border controversy by unveiling a proposed
parliamentary resolution saying a united Germany should sign a
treaty with Poland guaranteeing it would not try to recover
territory taken away after the war.

   Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood
probably was drunk when his tanker ran aground and triggered the
nation's worst oil spill, a toxicologist testified Tuesday.
   Richard Prouty, chief forensic toxicologist with the medical
examiner's office in Oklahoma, said he calculated that Hazelwood's
blood alcohol level would have been .14 percent at 12:05 a.m. on
March 24, when the oil tanker ran aground on a reef in Prince
William Sound.
   The legal limit in Alaska for operating a motor vehicle is .10
percent.
   The U.S. Coast Guard has a limit of .04 for operating a
commercial vessel, but jurors were not told of the regulation
because federal law is not involved in the state charges against
Hazelwood.
   The question of whether Hazelwood was drunk has been described
by his lawyers as the keystone of the case, because it reflects on
whether he acted recklessly as captain of the ship. The defense
contends Hazelwood wasn't drunk.
   Assistant District Attorney Brent Cole asked whether Prouty
would consider a person with a blood alcohol level of .14 to be
impaired in reasoning and making decisions.
   ``It is my opinion they definitely would be impaired,'' Prouty
said.
   Prouty was called as the final witness in the prosecution's case
against Hazelwood, but his cross-examination was put off until
Wednesday.
   Earlier, Hazelwoods' attorney suggested that an expert witness
designed calculations to show the tanker would capsize, drawing a
heated response from the witness.
   ``I did not contrive the calculations to show the ship would
sink,'' said William Vorus, a professor of naval architecture at
the University of Michigan.
   Hazelwood, 43, is charged with criminal mischief, reckless
endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent
discharge of oil. The seaman from Huntington, N.Y., faces up to 7\
years in prison and $61,000 in fines if convicted.
   The Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of Alaska
crude, devastating the rich wildlife in Prince William Sound.
   The most serious charge against Hazelwood is second degree
criminal mischief, which involves acting recklessly in disregarding
a known risk. Cole has focused on Hazelwood's behavior after the
grounding to prove this charge, with witnesses saying the skipper
ordered the engines turned on and the ship pointed forward.
   Some witnesses have said taking the ship off the rocks would
cause it to capsize or sink.
   But in a brief filed with the judge Monday, defense attorney
Dick Madson argued there was no risk that the ship would come off
the reef and Hazelwood could not have disregarded a risk that
didn't exist.
   Vorus acknowledged he did not figure into his calculations any
actions the crew of the stranded tanker might have taken to prevent
sinking if the ship got off a jagged reef that hung it up and
ruptured its tanks.
   ``There was no indication the crew was doing any of the things
you indicated,'' he told attorney Michael Chalos.
   ``And there was no indication the vessel was coming off the
reef, either, was there?'' asked Chalos.
   ``Under a slightly different situation, the vessel could have
come off the reef,'' said Vorus.
   But like other prosecution experts who testified before him,
Vorus agreed the ship was stuck solidly on Bligh Reef and the
scenario he created in which the ship was refloated and sank was
hypothetical.
   ``Do you agree it couldn't come off the reef?'' asked Chalos.
   ``Obviously, it didn't come off and that's as good a proof as
any that it wouldn't come off,'' Vorus said.
   Before he concluded his testimony, Vorus attempted to make a
strong protest of the defense attorney's implications that the
witnesses' calculations were scripted by the prosecution.
   ``I object to the accusations that are being put forth here,''
declared the witness. ``I think the state conducted itself most
properly in this case.''
   Chalos objected that ``the witness is making a speech,'' but
Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone allowed the comments to stand.
   Vorus earlier was allowed to give jurors an elaborate account of
a computer simulation of the grounding. The witness, who said his
engineering firm was being paid $40,000 by the state for its work
on the Hazelwood prosecution, gave a scholarly account about how a
ship stays afloat. He calculated that the Exxon Valdez would have
capsized 75 minutes after grounding if it was freed from the reef
in 10 minutes.

   Ron Kovic, the disabled Vietnam veteran whose
life was chronicled in the film ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
said Tuesday he will not run for Congress.
   Kovic gave no explanation for his decision against challenging
conservative Republican Rep. Robert Dornan of Garden Grove, saying
only in a statement released by an assistant: ``I've decided not to
run.''
   Kovic, 43, nominated for an Oscar for co-writing the screenplay
for the Oliver Stone film, was recruited by Democrats to run for
the seat held by conservative Republican Robert Dornan of Garden
Grove.
   The filing deadline for candidacy is Friday afternoon.
   The first word that Kovic was not running came in a telephone
call he made Tuesday morning to Tim Carpenter, an organizer for the
group Peace Politics who helped with Kovic's exploratory campaign
for the Orange County congressional seat.
   ``He said, `I'm sorry, but I'm not going to do it,''' said
Carpenter. ``I said, `I wish you would. But I look forward to
working with you sometime in the future.'''
   ``I'm real disappointed,'' said county Democratic Chairman
Michael Balmages, who had not talked to Kovic but was told by ``two
good sources'' that Kovic was not running.
   Balmages said he would be talking to two or three other possible
candidates who had been staying out of the running while Kovic was
a possible candidate. Balmages would not offer any names.
   Dornan, whose strong support of defense projects earned him the
nickname ``B-1 Bob,'' was not immediately available for comment.
   Tom Cruise, who played Kovic in ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
had intended to help Kovic campaign had Kovic decided to seek the
position.
   Dornan took the possible Kovic challenge seriously, sending out
20,000 fund-raising letters that portrayed Kovic as a draft card
burning ultra-liberal.
   Dornan wrote that ``Born on the Fourth of July'' offered a
number of reasons to vote against Kovic. The film, based on a book
by Kovic, traces his life from being a strong supporter of the
Vietnam War to a disillusioned, anti-war activist.
   ``The movie shows Kovic in a panic and mistakenly shooting his
corporal to death in Vietnam, visiting prostitutes, abusing drugs
and alcohol and cruelly insulting his parents,'' the letter said.
``And this is a person the liberals want in the U.S. Congress. No
way.''

   About 5,000 friends, family members and
classmates gave basketball star Hank Gathers a final, thunderous
ovation Tuesday on the same court where he played his last game.
   ``Every time I pick up a basketball for the rest of my life,
Hank will be there with me,'' said Bo Kimble, Gathers' friend and
teammate at Loyola Marymount University. Gathers died Sunday after
collapsing during a game.
   ``It's so difficult right now to be here speaking of my beloved
friend and brother,'' Kimble said during the memorial and Mass at
the Catholic university. ``Hank, I love you so much, you mean the
world to me. I know Hank would want to hear one more cheer here in
his house.''
   The crowd at Loyola Marymount's Albert Gersten Pavilion then
rose to their feet, cheered and applauded for several minutes.
Gathers' mother, Lucille Gathers, rushed to the front and hugged
Kimble.
   Less than 72 hours earlier, Gathers had collapsed on the court.
He was pronounced dead less than two hours later in a nearby
hospital.
   Gathers, who fainted during a game on Dec. 9 and was diagnosed
as having an irregular heart beat, was 23. The cause of death has
not yet been determined.
   Gathers was remembered by the Rev. Thomas Higgins as a stirring
player who battled to overcome an impoverished and disadvantaged
background.
   After reciting a passage from Hamlet, Higgins turned the words
to fit Gathers.
   ``What a piece of work was Hank,'' Higgins said. ``Hank was a
very bright, intelligent man. He didn't have many educational
advantages. It took courage to go to class, but Hank was a hero
every day.''
   Higgins led the crowd in a chant which grew louder and louder,
``We love you Hank, we miss you Hank, we commend you to God.''
   The memorial, with Gathers' body in a silver casket draped with
red and white flowers, was attended by Gathers' mother, his two
brothers, his sister and his aunt.
   Lucille Gathers sat through much of the service being comforted
by the Rev. David Hagan, a family friend who had been Gathers'
mentor as a youngster in Philadelphia.
   Hagan said he hoped a memorial would be set up for Gathers'
family and that the gym would someday bear Gathers' name.
   ``He broke his body and gave his blood for this university,''
Hagan said.
   Said Loyola coach Paul Westhead: ``For all of us to go on, that
is the task. For Hank, the decision would be simple. `Clear the
floor.' He would play today.''
   During the Mass, Gathers' teammates presented the player's
family with his scarlet and white jersey, No. 44, and a photograph
of him making a slam dunk.
   After receiving the jersey, Gather's brother Derrick walked
slowly up the aisle holding the jersey aloft.

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted
bail to Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the opposition leader who was
arrested in connection with December's bloody coup attempt, but it
delayed ruling on the validity of a charge against him.
   The decision appeared to be a setback for President Corazon
Aquino's government, which accused Enrile last week of ``rebellion
with murder.''
   The court said bail was granted because the chances were
``fairly remote'' that Enrile would flee the country. But the panel
said it made no determination on whether rebellion and murder could
be charged together.
   Enrile's lawyers argued that a 1956 Supreme Court decision
nullified the joint charge. One justice, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the court would meet in a few weeks to review the
1956 ruling.
   Lawyers for Enrile said they expect the court to decide on the
dual charge within the month.
   Late Tuesday, Enrile's lawyers presented his release order to
authorities and he walked out of the suburban Northern Police
headquarters, where he has been jailed since last week.
   ``Like a jailed bird that has just been set free, I'll fly away
happily,'' Enrile said while signing autographs for police officers
before boarding his bulletproof van.
   In a radio interview Wednesday, Enrile called the case against
him ``unbelievable.'' He said the court's decision to release him
without deciding the merits of the charge was done so as not to
embarrass the government.
   ``I am praying for our president for enlightenment,'' Enrile
said. ``She is in a very difficult situation because ... she does
not know everything that is happening around her.''
   After a three-hour hearing Tuesday, 10 justices voted in favor
of granting $4,650 bail each to Enrile and two co-defendants, hotel
owner Rebecco Panlilio and his wife. Four other justices voted to
deny bail and one abstained.
   Rebellion is punishable by six to 12 years in prison, and
defendants are eligible for bail. Murder carries a life sentence
and bail is not allowed.
   Enrile and six others were indicted Feb. 27 in the Dec. 1-9 coup
attempt, in which at least 113 people were killed and more than 600
injured. Enrile denies any role.
   Some of Enrile's colleagues in the Senate criticized how the
government handled the case.
   Sen. Ernesto Maceda, a lawyer, said Enrile should have been
charged only with rebellion.
   ``Then maybe there would not have been any problems in turning
Enrile into a martyr and a hero. The result of the administration's
decision to file a complex case is really bad,'' Maceda said.
   Enrile was charged after witnesses claimed they saw former Lt.
Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a rebellion leader, at Enrile's
home on the first day of the coup attempt. The Panlilios were also
allegedly at the Enrile home on Dec. 1.
   During the hearing, about 200 Enrile sympathizers gathered
outside the courthouse carrying signs reading ``Justice for
Enrile.'' A group of anti-Enrile demonstrators rallied at another
gate, and hundreds of armed police stood guard in the building and
nearby streets.
   Inside, one of Enrile's lawyers, former Supreme Court Justice
Serafin Cuevas, argued that the detention of the opposition senator
is illegal and unconstitutional.
   ``We say so because the information under which he was charged
and sought to be prosecuted is for an offense that does not exist
in our law books,'' Cuevas added.
   Solicitor Gen. Francisco Chavez argued that the law does allow
for a dual charge ``if a single act involves two or more grave or
less grave felonies.''
   He recommended that the court reconsider the 1956 ruling.
   ``What we have here is ... disgruntled members of the armed
forces, military adventurists, plain and simply power grabbers.''
   As defense minister, Enrile led the February 1986 mutiny that
precipitated the ``people power'' revolution that swept Mrs. Aquino
to power. He was fired nine months later after a failed coup by his
followers.
   Among those indicted with Enrile was suspended provincial Gov.
Rodolfo Aguinaldo. On Sunday, officials tried to arrest Aguinaldo
in Tuguegarao, 250 miles north of Manila.
   But Aguinaldo's forces seized a hotel, taking government
representative Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo hostage and trapping
several officials on the upper floors. Florendo was slain during
fighting to retake the hotel and Aguinaldo fled during the clash.
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered troops to
capture Aguinaldo ``at all costs.''

in Cash</HEAD>

   The Internal Revenue Service has served summonses on criminal
defense attorneys around the country demanding that they reveal the
names of clients who paid large lawyer fees with cash, an IRS
official confirmed Tuesday.
   Lawyers argue that such disclosures would violate the
fundamental right of attorney-client privilege.
   The attorneys were told to bring their financial records to IRS
offices, according to Miami attorney Neal Sonnett, president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. One lawyer served
said an IRS agent told him that 900 lawyers were to receive
summonses.
   ``We have heard from enough lawyers around the country to
recognize that it appears to be a nationwide assault upon criminal
defense lawyers,'' said Sonnett, whose organization knows of 12
lawyers who were served. ``... I think there's hundreds of
attorneys who will go to jail for this.''
   In October, the IRS sent letters to about 940 criminal defense
attorneys requesting information on clients who paid them more than
$10,000 in cash, Sonnett said.
   The letter, signed by Christopher J. Lezovich, an IRS official
in Detroit, was sent to attorneys around the country giving them 30
days to identify the clients. It also included a warning that
non-compliance would result in summonses.
   Tax collectors are acting under a disclosure law passed by
Congress in 1985. The law, initially widely ignored, was aimed at
exposing tax evaders, including major drug dealers who often
transact business in cash.
   The original penalties for failure to disclose were only
misdemeanors. But a year ago, Congress reclassified violations as
felonies punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
   The summonses received by lawyers on Tuesday were signed by
local IRS agents, Sonnett said.
   Lezovich said Tuesday night that the Detroit IRS office within
the past 10 days wrote to field offices to advise them that agents
might want to serve summonses against the lawyers who received the
letters in October.
   ``We got some back, some provided the information, some didn't.
Of those, some were selected for the first wave'' of summonses, he
said. The Detroit IRS office is one of the agency's main computer
centers, and it processes Form 8300, which among other things
requests that filers list cash sums of at least $10,000 they have
received.
   ``We anticipate that was just a first cut. This isn't going to
be the end of it,'' Lezovich said of the summonses.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said his department
took part in discussions last year with the IRS and lawyers' groups
on the issue.
   ``It's very clear what the issue is here ... it grows out of
concerns about drug payments,'' Runkel said.
   Sonnett said the summonses request that attorneys bring all
their financial records, including bank statements and payment
records, and not just bookkeeping related to the federal 8300 forms.
   ``I cannot conceive of a summons that is more blatantly a
fishing expedition, which in effect asks the lawyer to turn over
all his financial records to the IRS to roam through,'' he said.
   John Wesley Hall, a criminal defense lawyer in Little Rock, said
revenue agent John W. Prather Jr. of Little Rock indicated that a
nationwide move by the IRS was under way against 900 lawyers who
refused to reveal the names of clients.
   Hall said he would not comply with the demand of the summons.
   The summons served on Hall directed him to bring all his bank
records from 1987 to 1989 to the IRS office in Little Rock on March
27.
   ``Talk about over-reaching,'' Hall said, adding that he has had
two clients pay him more than $10,000 each during the last three
years. The summons involves one of them, he said.
   The privilege of the lawyer-client relationship is not only
granted in state law, but also is a constitutional privilege, Hall
said.
   ``I believe I am duty-bound not to provide the requested
information,'' Hall said.

   Saudi Arabians gave $2 million in two
donations to Nancy Reagan's war on drugs, providing more than half
of the money raised for her anti-drug fund, according to a report
published Wednesday.
   Saudi King Fahd gave $1 million in 1985 and another $1 million
came later from Mouaffak al Midani, a Syrian-Saudi businessman, The
Washington Post said in its Wednesday editions. The newspaper said
its report was based on documents and interviews with the people
involved.
   The donations came at the same time the Saudi royal family was
helping to finance the contras in their war against the Sandinistas
in Nicaragua and as the administration was considering a weapons
sale to the Saudis, the newspaper said. The Saudis were permitted
to buy some, but not all, of the weapons they wanted.
   James Rosebush, who was chief of staff to the first lade at the
time, said the Saudi donations were not intended to influence her
or President Reagan.
   ``That it why we set up this arms's length fund,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Mrs. Reagan's fund raised another $1.6 million from smaller
contributions and some tennis tournaments.

<TEXT>
   A jury on Tuesday convicted Lebanese-born Charles
Yacoub on two charges arising from his hijacking of a New
York-bound bus to Parliament Hill last April and holding police at
bay for eight hours before surrendering.
   All 10 hostages on the bus eventually were released unharmed.
   After more than 17 hours of deliberations, the jury convicted
Yacoub, 33, of forcible confinement, which carries a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison, and use of a weapon to commit an
offense, which carries a minimum sentence of one year in prison and
a maximum of 10 years.
   He was acquitted of charges of hostage-taking, which could have
brought a sentence of life in prison; intimidation of Parliament
and aggravated assault.
   Yacoub, who sat without emotion in court while the jury rendered
the verdict, was held in custody to await sentencing.
   In his closing arguments in the Supreme Court of Ontario Monday,
defense lawyer Michael Kastner contended that while Yacoub was
responsible for the incident, he had no criminal intent because of
his mental state.
   Psychiatrists described Yacoub as suffering from hypomania, a
reaction to depression in which people are driven by uncontrollable
thoughts to do irrational things.
   Justice Jean-Charles Sirois reminded jurors that some passengers
testified they were terrified during the incident.
   ``I suggest to you that acts of violence were committed and that
all passengers were traumatized by their confinement,'' Sirois said.
   Yacoub, who came to Canada from Lebanon in 1976 and lived in
Repentigny, Quebec, near Montreal, used a .45-caliber pistol to
pull off the hijacking.
   Kastner said that while he would have preferred a complete
acquittal, the verdict was a victory because Yacoub was acquitted
of the most serious charges. The lawyer indicated he will appeal
the verdict and will also request bail.
   ``He's not a terrorist, '' Kastner said outside the courtroom.
``He's a jeweler from Montreal and was in a state of irresistible
impulse when he committed this.''
   The court was told Yacoub hijacked the Greyhound bus to bring
attention to the fighting in war-torn Lebanon, his homeland.
   He commandeered a bus bound for New York City from Montreal at
about noon on April 7 and forced the driver to take it to Ottawa,
where it wound up on the front lawn of Parliament Hill. Initially
nine passengers and the driver were held as hostages.
   Yacoub was demanding withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon,
the court was told.
   Crown attorney Julianne Parfett said Yacoub was a terrorist and
should have been convicted of all charges against him.

   Many lenders will soon offer a new type of
mortgage designed to appeal to home buyers who expect to move
within seven years but want the security of a fixed-rate mortgage
in case they don't.
   The loans, called two-step mortgages, are a cross between an
adjustable-rate loan, where the rate can change every one, three or
five years, and a traditional 30-year mortgage, where the interest
rate does not change for the life of the loan.
   In the first step of the new mortgage, borrowers pay an interest
rate up to three-eighths of a percentage point lower than on a
30-year, fixed-rate loan. After seven years, the rate is reset at
2.25 to 2.5 percentage points higher than the rate on 10-year
Treasury notes.
   On a typical mortgage of $83,000, home buyers currently would
save $23 a month, or $1,932 over the first seven years. However,
the rate for the remaining 23 yearsof the mortgage likely would be
somewhat higher than on a new 30-year loan taken out at
readjustment time.

   Opponents of a new federal law making it a
crime to burn the American flag scored another victory when a
second federal judge ruled that the statute runs afoul of the
Constitution.
   But Monday's ruling by U.S. District Judge June Green here also
gives proponents of a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning
more political ammunition for their cause.
   President Bush endorsed the amendment route to undo last year's
Supreme Court ruling that struck down a Texas flag-burning law,
saying he was unsure that the statute Congress passed instead would
survive court challenges.
   So far, Bush and other supporters of a constitutional amendment
have been proven correct.

   College students prefer periodic tests
or term papers to big final exams and learn more from teachers who
give them substantial, immediate feedback, a Harvard University
study found.
   For example, a ``one-minute, low-tech, no-cost'' technique is to
ask students at the end of each class for a quick, one-paragraph
summary of what they learned, said Richard J. Light, author of the
three-year study issued Monday.
   The study concludes that modest shifts in academic policies can
create major improvements in college classrooms.
   Light, a professor at Harvard's Graduate School of Education and
Kennedy School of Government, based the study on in-depth
interviews with 360 Harvard undergraduates _ conducted by their
fellow students _ and seminars that included faculty and
administrators from Harvard and about 20 other institutions.

   The rare ritual of exorcism, practiced twice by
the New York Archdiocese in a year, is cloaked in mystery even for
those most familiar with it. But priests say the movie ``The
Exorcist'' depicted it pretty well.
   ``A lot of people think they know the answer, but my experience
is nobody really does,'' said the Rev. John Nicola, a priest with
the Washington Archdiocese who assisted at four exorcisms in Rome
from 1973 to 1975.
   He added, ``Even psychiatrists who have no belief in the
supernatural will tell you about cases.''
   Catholic theologians expressed surprise Monday that Cardinal
John J. O'Connor reported the two New York exorcisms. He made the
disclosure during a Sunday sermon at St. Patrick's Cathedral in
which he said, ``Diabolically instigated violence is on the rise.''

   Instead, she walked a picket line Monday while tourists at 11

<TEXT>
   Texaco's 50-year love affair with the
Metropolitan Opera is being celebrated on both radio and television
in concerts highlighting memorable moments from past performances.
   On radio, a live gala will take the place of the regular
Saturday afternoon opera broadcast March 10 on the
Texaco-Metropolitan Opera Radio Network. More than a dozen singers
and six conductors will perform arias, ensembles and overtures that
have been favorites during the 50 years of Texaco sponsorship.
   On television, the Public Broadcasting Service is offering
``Great Moments from the Met,'' culled from the nearly 50 operas
televised since 1977, thanks to funding from Texaco. The show is
being made available to PBS stations for use anytime during the
March 1990 pledge drive.
   ``Great Moments'' is packed with as much vocal talent as anyone
could ask for: Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo are
represented (twice each) and so are Kathleen Battle, Jessye Norman
and Samuel Ramey. All are in excellent voice as they perform arias
or duets from favorite roles.
   But, somehow, the whole adds up to considerably less than the
sum of its parts.
   Part of the problem is that we can't appreciate these artists
fully just hearing snippets of their work. Worse, even the snippets
are interrupted by voice-overs as the performers give us their
mostly superfluous views on what the characters they are portraying
are all about.
   ``I'm going to do this opera until I can't,'' Pavarotti tells us
eagerly, but uninformatively, about Donizetti's ``L'Elisir
d'Amore.'' Miss Norman, discussing the title role of Strauss'
``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' discloses the surprising news that ``I
always empathize with all of the characters that I sing.''
   The unquestionable highlight of the telecast is Leontyne Price's
farewell performance in 1984 of Aida's third act aria ``O patria
mia.'' Not only was the soprano in unusually fine voice, her
comments about the occasion, made in an interview during the last
year, are deeply moving.
   ``For the rest of my life, whenever I view the tape of that
final performance, I can't possibly be unhappy,'' the soprano says,
tears welling in her eyes. ``... I really get goose pimples just
thinking of it now.''
   The other singer who comes off well is Teresa Stratas, heard in
two wildly differing roles _ the gentle, tragic Mimi of Puccini's
``La Boheme'' and the hardbitten prostitute Jenny in the Kurt
Weill-Bertolt Brecht ``Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.''
   Miss Stratas is worth listening to even when she's not singing.
She brings a rare insight and intensity to her discussion of the
operas.
   The program ends with another maddeningly incomplete excerpt,
part of the farewell scene from Act Three of Wagner's ``Die
Walkuere,'' sung by Hildegard Behrens and James Morris. This, as
host F. Murray Abraham reminds us, is but a tease for the upcoming
complete telecast of the Met's Ring Cycle on four consecutive
nights in June.
   The Texaco radio concert can't match the TV production's star
power, but it will have the advantage of being live and
spontaneous. It's so spontaneous, in fact, that the final program
was being nailed down a week before the broadcast.
   ``Originally, we were going to have recorded highlights and
interviews, but as the anniversary season became more and more
important, we decided to have the live concert,'' explained Charles
Sheek, the Met's associate press representative.
   So what was printed on the season schedule as a performance of
Gounod's ``Faust'' instead became a special event. The cast was
assembled mostly from singers already in town for performances or
rehearsals.
   ``We tried to choose artists in roles they became well known
for, and some operas that have an important broadcast history,''
Sheek said.
   The concert will open with Met artistic director James Levine
conducting the overture to Mozart's ``Le Nozze di Figaro,'' the
very first Met opera broadcast under Texaco sponsorship in 1940.
   Other likely highlights:
   _ Marilyn Horne singing from Rosina's aria from Rossini's ``Il
Barbiere di Siviglia,'' an opera the great mezzo is retiring from
her repertory.
   _ Carol Vanness singing Fiordiligi's aria ``Come scoglio'' from
Mozart's ``Cosi fan tutte.''
   _ Dolores Ziegler, a recent Met debutante, singing the
composer's aria from Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos.''
   _ Kurl Moll in Daland's ``Lobst du mein Kind'' from Wagner's
``Der Fliegende Hollaender.''
   _ Ashley Putnam, Francisco Araiza and Samuel Ramey in the final
trio from ``Faust.''
   _ Dawn Upshaw singing ``No word from Tom,'' from Stravinsky's
``The Rake's Progress.''
   The ever-present Placido Domingo will be taking part in this
concert too _ but not as a singer. He's one of the six conductors
who will take turns leading the Met orchestra.

<HEAD>Cable, ``Santa Barbara'' and Coproductions Part of New Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In television ratings talk, the numbers are
down _ way down _ for communism in the East bloc, and liberated
audiences are ready for their first glimpse of ``Santa Barbara''
and other bourgeois decadence.
   Expatriate Soviets, American television executives _ including
``Garfield's'' animator _ and a cable company headed by a Polish
concentration camp escapee are among those trying to grab a piece
of the new marketplace.
   Others aren't sure Eastern European and Soviet audiences are
worth the stretch for commercial television.
   ``They have no money, so it will be quite some time before it
approaches a meaningful market,'' warned Colin Davis, the head of
MCA Television International. ``Some have taken the approach of
giving them a show and then sharing in advertising revenue. But
there isn't much advertising because there isn't much in the way of
consumer goods.''
   Conduit Internationale Films has offered ``The Wonder Years''
and the soap opera ``Santa Barbara'' to newly established Polish
commercial television Channel 2.
   The shows will begin airing this month, while Conduit tries to
drum up international advertising. One prime-time minute on Polish
television sells for $6,500, with the revenue to be split between
Conduit, the program supplier and the Polish television firm.
Conduit claims 10,000 television households in Poland.
   Robert Spinner, head of Conduit's advertising push, said he
believes the television and consumer markets will grow
simultaneously in Poland.
   ``I don't see it as a great market for BMWs, but for low-cost
items such as cosmetics, soap, cold remedies and soft drinks, its a
good market,'' Spinner said.
   While Conduit will seek to program standard airwave channels,
another American company, Chase Enterprises of Hartford, Conn., is
installing television cable lines in Poland and Hungary.
   Headed by Polish-born David Chase, who survived four World War
II concentration camps including Auschwitz before escaping, the
media company recently signed a deal giving it 70 percent of the
Polish cable franchise, with 30 percent under control by a
government consortium.
   ``In all likelihood, there will not be an immediate gold mine,''
conceded Arnold Chase, David's son. ``There are still problems to
be overcome, and there are still changes going on, but the changes
are for the positive.''
   The son estimated the cost for cabling Poland at $900 million.
The company last week also entered into a similar cable agreement
with Hungary roughly estimated to cost $250 million.
   Soviet television has had a few experimental broadcasts of
American programming, and Russian media experts in the United
States predict there will someday be a market for commercial
American shows in their country.
   But the current effort to establish Western television in the
Soviet Union involves co-productions bringing American and West
European cash in exchange for low-cost Soviet talent and studios.
   Film Roman, the Burbank, Calif.-based animation studio that
turns out the ``Garfield'' cartoon series and specials, has signed
an agreement with the Soviets establishing a 10,000-square foot
studio outside Moscow.
   The move is the latest quest by American animation studios to
find cheaper labor outside the country. In recent years, said Film
Roman chief executive officer Phil Roman, film animation
contracting has traveled from Japan to Korea to Taiwan.
   The Soviet animation artists will do backgrounds, ink, paint and
camera work, with post-production, such as adding character voices
and sound effects, handled back in the United States.
   ``They offer very high animation at a very reasonable price.
They get paid two or three times what they are normally making and
the cost is still below what it is for us in the Far East,'' said
Roman. ``They want to be recognized outside the Soviet Union, and
their country needs the hard currency.''
   Television movies and miniseries planned for filming in the
Soviet Union by American companies such as MGM@UA Television and
Fries Entertainment are coordinated by a recently established USSR
Film Service in Los Angeles.
   Efforts targeted for this year include a production on the
Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster and a miniseries on a joint
U.S.-Soviet space flight to Mars.
   Yuri Spilny, who left the Soviet Union in 1972, heads the USSR
Film Service office, making sure American producers get what they
need from the Soviet Union's 39 studios. He believes American shows
will find a way to Soviet viewers.
   ```Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' _ now, that would be like
a fantasy night for Soviet television,'' Spilny joked.
   ``It's just a question of time. They have a huge audience there
... An American film could be seen there by 200 million television
viewers,'' said Ilmar Taska, who will produce the presentation of
the best foreign film Oscar from Moscow for the 62nd annual Academy
Awards.
   ``The same way as McDonald's has crossed over, American
television will come to the Soviet network as well.''

<HEAD>Inventors Often Find Uphill Battle in Marketing Ideas</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is on vacation.</NOTE>

   Entrepreneur Chris Graff wants the world to
know he can build a better bedframe. But his trademarked
Bedfellows, at first glance a collection of oddly twisted metal
tubes, doesn't look like a bedframe.
   He believes that's his problem.
   Graff finds that largely indifferent manufacturers, sales reps
and customers are suggesting he give the idea a rest. The path to
his office door at Geste Corp. hasn't been beaten smooth.
   ``It's been pretty cold all across the board,'' he says.
   So it often goes when inventors and business venturers attempt
to sell the public a new twist on an old idea, say patent attorneys
and marketing experts.
   Customers are reluctant to change. Marketers are slow to see the
new product's brilliance _ at least from the inventor's point of
view. Those whose fortunes are tied to conventional products may
battle the upstart competition.
   ``With a lot of innovative products, regardless of their
performance and the benefits they provide, that is the wall the
innovator keeps running up against,'' says Scott Jessup, who
teaches entrepreneurship at the University of Notre Dame.
   In the world of sponsored research, each patentable idea may
cost at least $5 million, Purdue University figures show. A
corporate portfolio containing hundreds of patents may include only
a few that actually make money.
   It's tough for the big fish, and even harder for the small fry.
   More than 40 years ago, Preston Tucker introduced an automobile
that bore his name and offered motorists a four-door fastback with
a rear engine and headlights that turned with the steering wheel.
Only 51 cars were produced and Tucker's dream died, mired in
Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges that ended in an
acquittal.
   Detroit inventor Robert W. Kearns developed intermittent
windshield wipers in the 1960s only to discover automakers weren't
interested. He went to court in the 1980s after the wipers became
standard equipment and recently won a judgment against Ford Motor
Co.
   Graff bought the patent rights to Bedfellows last year, and so
far has sold little more than 250 sets for under $30. His chief
competition is the standard Hollywood bedframe that sells for about
the same price. There the similarities end.
   The bedframe doesn't look remotely like one. It more resembles
sets of bicycle handlebars put together and fastened to the
underside of a box spring mattress. Its advantages over a
conventional frame, says Graff, are considerable.
   Bedfellows for a full-size boxspring weighs about six pounds,
one-fourth the weight of a standard frame. That cuts into the
considerable costs of shipping, and eases the chores of storage and
store display, says Graff.
   Customers get a break, too. The assembled frame is easier to
move, even with mattress and box springs, because the weight is
distributed on eight points, instead of four.
   Its odd configuration eliminates exposed rails and legs _ ending
the age-old menace of stubbed toes and barked shins. ``I've bumped
my toe enough times in the middle of the night to realize there
some merit there,'' Graff says.
   Jessup, president of an investment banking firm, concedes he's
nearly lost a few toes on conventional bedframes himself. ``But
would I go out and buy that? It would take a pretty significant
experience to take that leap of faith.''
   Disappointed expectations arise sometimes from unrealistic
hopes, say patent and marketing experts. Some inventors wildly
inflate the value of an idea that makes a product only marginally
more salable.
   But Graff persists, looking for new marketing outlets.
   ``I've lost money so far, but you don't plan on making money
this far into the project,'' he says. ``I'm convinced it's a good
product. And once the consumer gets ahold of it...''

<HEAD>Moneychangers Thrive in Post-Revolutionary Bucharest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners tell of the tourist who
visited Dracula's castle in Transylvania and was awakened the first
night by a caped figure.
   He was terrified. He trembled as the figure approached, its
mouth open, fangs dripping blood.
   It spoke: ``Change money?''
   Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu imposed harsh penalties on
money-changers, but they thrive on the flood of journalists and
other foreigenrs who have arrived since he was overthrown and
executed in December.
   One dollar buys 20 lei at the official rate, but 70 on the black
market, and rates of up to 160 have been reported from the
countryside.
   Most foreigners stay at the Intercontinental Hotel, which used
to be off-limits to the average Romanian and crawling with agents
of the Securitate, Ceausescu's hated secret police.
   Now it crawls with money-changers, who have a much easier time
of it than during Ceausecu's 24 years in power.
   All Romanians were required to report contacts with foreigners
and strict limits were put on possession of hard currency. They had
to deposit all hard currency in special accounts and explain where
they got it.
   Since the revolution, money-changers appear wherever there is a
demand. The unofficial exchange of currency remains illegal, but
the authorities are choosing to ignore it, at least for the moment.
   Money-changers seem a sign of the new times, like Bucharest's
first privately owned businesses _ a clothing store and photography
shop that opened in February.
   They pursue their trade in hotels, taxis, restaurants, on the
street, and occasionally diversify.
   One approached a Canadian reporter in a hotel lobby and offered
to sell an antique Russian icon. Later, he offered an American a
gold French cigarette lighter.
   Two others tried to peddle a gold watch they claimed had been
Ceausescu's.
   ``You have to make a living,'' said one, who identified himself
as Velentin. ``Around here, where a manager makes maybe 4,200 lei a
month ($60 at the black market rate), you starve if you don't find
all kinds of ways to make money.''
   There have been reports of money-changers trying to cheat
foreigners by offering what appear to be large rolls of money _
100-lei notes on the outside and toilet paper on the inside.
   Another common trick is for the money-changer to stop a
transaction suddenly, explaining that the rate has changed or
someone is watching, then try to return a $1 bill instead of the
$50 or $100 the foreigner was exchanging.
   One Sunday, protesters forced their way into the government
headquarters in Victory Square, ransacked it and trapped Gelu
Voican, the deputy prime minister, in his office for several hours.
   Several foreign reporters and about 20 soldiers were in a group
that joined Voican in the office.
   A photographer pointed to a tall, dark man and said, ``He's
familiar.''
   In a few minutes, the man edged up to a reporter and said:
``Change money?''

<HEAD>At the Movies: `Bad Influence'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A few decades ago, Errol Flynn was charged with the rape of a
pair of teen-age girls (he was acquitted), and Robert Mitchum was
busted for smoking marijuana (he served time).
   The scandals seemed capable of destroying the stars' careers,
but their studios put them in heroic roles and Flynn and Mitchum
became more popular than before.
   That brings us to ``Bad Influence,'' starring Rob Lowe. Yes, the
Rob Lowe who got in a jam by videotaping sex between a couple of
young women in an Atlanta hotel room.
   Far from being a hero in ``Bad Influence,'' Lowe plays a totally
immoral figure capable of deceit, robbery and murder. In the film
he videotapes sex between two of the other protagonists and uses
the tape for a shocking purpose. In a later scene he lands in bed
with two nubile and eager beauties.
   Exploitive? Some may think so. A new furor may arise, perhaps
obscuring the fact that ``Bad Influence'' is a crackerjack suspense
movie.
   The great Hitchock comes to mind. He loved outlandish
situations, such as the chase across Mount Rushmore in ``North by
Northwest.'' In ``Bad Influence,'' two brothers try to dispose of a
body in Los Angeles' famed La Brea tar pits. The film's theme is
basic Hitchcock: Normal citizen finds himself enmeshed in a deadly
game.
   James Spader is a marketing analyst successful in his work and
engaged to the rich, beautiful Kathleen Wilhoite. His life is
well-ordered until an encounter in a beach bar with Lowe, a
ruthless charmer who takes over Spader's life, teaching him to
outfox his office rivals and introducing him to a dangerous beauty,
Lisa Zane.
   Lowe introduces Spader to fast living, drugs and Los Angeles'
undergound nightlife, then to criminal acts. Spader restores his
senses and tries to escape, but to his horror he becomes involved
in murder.
   ``Bad Influence'' might have been just another exercise in the
destructive fast-lane life of Los Angeles. But David Koepp has
fashioned a screenplay filled with unexpected turns and shocks, and
Curtis Hanson directed in taut style, aided immeasurably by Robert
Elswit's stunning photography.
   Spader (``sex, lies and videotape'') draws an impressive
characterization of a man in a quagmire. Lowe, whose previous work
has seemed vapid and colorless, corrects that impression this time
out. He is profoundly evil as the protean drifter.
   Steve Tisch directed the Epic Production, which bears a
well-deserved R for nudity, sex, violence, drugs and language.
Running time: 110 minutes.

   ``25 x 5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones'' (CBS
Music Video. VHS, $19.98. No Rating)
   
   ``It was image that counted,'' Keith Richards recalls in the
video documentary ``25 x 5: The Continuing Adventures of the
Rolling Stones.''
   ``We were very hip to image and how to manipulate the press.''
   Richards was referring to the mid-1960s, when the Stones were
presented as the dangerous alternative to the lovable Beatles, even
though, as Mick Jagger points out, ``They were just as cynical as
we were.''
   Visits to children's hospitals were kept secret, such headlines
as ``Would You Let Your Daughter Marry a Rolling Stone?''
encouraged hostility.
   ``What mood do we have today?'' Richards says of those times,
speaking like a seasoned campaign manager.
   Image still counts. Call this video ``Beat the Press: The
Continuing Adventures of Rock 'n' Roll Spin Doctors.'' Like so many
authorized biographies, ``25 x 5'' is a documentary of selective
candor. The truth is told, but never the whole truth. Good times,
bad times, the Stones get the last word.
   You'll learn what kind of car Bill Wyman owned in 1966, and how
former manager Allen Klein bullied executives into giving the
Stones the best contract in the world. You'll also learn that
Jagger would be happy to resume his acting career, if, of course,
he received ``the right part.''
   There's not a word about classic albums such as ``Aftermath''
and ``Let It Bleed,'' but there are highlights from the weddings of
Richards, Wyman and Ron Wood (with only Wyman including an oath of
fidelity), and lectures on the importance of family.
   Jimmy Miller, who produced ``Beggar's Banquet,'' ``Sticky
Fingers'' and ``Exiles on Main Street'' among others, is ignored.
Chuck Berry gets a single mention. The lowest point comes when
Jagger brushes off the tragic 1969 concert at Altamont _ during
which a young fan was murdered by Hell's Angels _ with the comment,
``It still doesn't sully the tour for me.''
   As the Stones tell it, the real secret to their success was
manager Andrew Loog Oldham, who boasted of their nasty habits, and
Klein, who pushed them ahead financially.
   ``I just wanted to get the point of view from the guys'
perspective,'' explained producer Andrew Solt, whose previous
credits include ``Imagine: John Lennon,'' ``This Is Elvis'' and the
acclaimed ``Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll.''
   ``They really were hip to the press,'' Solt said. ``The press
was critical to this process. They were bad boys to an extent, but
they certainly weren't as bad as they were supposed to be.''
   The press falls for it. ``Let's get down to brass tacks,'' a
reporter asks an obviously delighted Jagger. ``Are you better at
what you do than the Beatles are at what they do?''
   ``Are you satisfied?'' another reporter asks Jagger.
   ``Sexually, satisfied. Financially, not satisfied.
Philosophically, trying,'' is the response.
   The more sophisticated Dick Cavett can come up with nothing
better to ask than will Jagger be performing ``Satisfaction'' as an
old man.
   The Stones look happiest on stage, and the video would work
better if the interviews were simply edited out. Just watch
Richards bob his head and grin as the band rips through ``Around
and Around,'' or Jagger step into ``Satisfaction'' and later prowl
the stage during ``Midnight Rambler.'' Wonderful clips of bluesmen
Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf, two major influences, are also
highlights.
   But the clips are usually just that; only a handful of
performances are shown all the way through. And after 1972, the
only adventures are touring, making videos and finding new ways to
keep the media on its toes.
   Even Solt got bored.
   ``I found it of less interest,'' he said. ``There were a few
important songs and moments and events, but it was more the drama
of the band. They really weren't on top of their form all the
time.''

   ``La Gioconda,'' opera in four acts by Amilcare Ponchielli, a
three CD album (CBS Records)
   
   What is one to make of ``La Gioconda'' anyway? It's a
``warhorse'' in the worst sense of the term, a clunky work with an
absurd plot, cardboard characters and some long strecthes of
third-rate music. Yet its big tunes are winners and given a strong
recording such as this one, the opera should win over plenty of
listeners to its crude but forceful charms.
   As the album notes by Barrymore Laurence Scherer point out, this
relic is about the only surviving specimen of Italian opera from
the long period when Verdi, late in life, temporarily retired from
composing for the stage. (That would span the period between
``Aida'' in 1871 and ``Otello'' in 1887. ``Gioconda'' premiered at
La Scala in 1876.)
   The title role of the anything-but-happy street singer is
powerfully sung here by Eva Marton. Like Ghena Dimitrova (who sang
the role at the Metropolitan Opera this year) she exemplifies the
stentorian, rather than the lyric, school of soprano singing.
That's fine, since subtlety seems beside the point in portraying a
character who, from the moment the curtain rises, barely stops
rushing from one crisis to another. In Act 1, she frets that her
blind mother will be burned at the stake; in Act 2, she tries to
murder her romantic rival; in Act 3, she turns around and saves the
rival's life; in Act 4, she finally stabs herself to avoid the
sexual advances of the villain.
   As Enzo, the nobleman-in-disguise whom Gioconda loves, tenor
Giorgio Lamberti is no Pavarotti, but he sounds at least decent,
and better than that in his big Act 2 aria, ``Cielo e mar!''
Baritone Sherrill Milnes enthusiastically throws what remains of
his once impressive voice into the role of the evil Barnaba, but he
can't avoid sounding frayed and occasionally flat.
   Mezzo Livia Budai is imposing as Laura; contralto Anne Gjevang
does nicely by the lovely Act 1 prayer Ponchielli composed for La
Cieca, Gioconda's mother; and bass Samuel Ramey is wasted in the
silly and entirely uninteresting part of Alvise.
   The late Giuseppe Patane conducts the Hungarian State Orchestra
with the verve and smoothness for which he was renowned.

   ``Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop'' (Epic) _ Jeff Beck
   
   It's tough these days being a guitar hero. Every heavy metal
band has at least one, leaving few riffs unturned.
   How can a guy attract some attention with so much competition?
Jeff Beck, who first won fame as a guitar pyrotechnician in the
1960s, decided to make studio gadgetry the cornerstone of the
mostly instrumental ``Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop.''
   Bad idea; the result is high-tech but no-soul. This music
contains a little rock, a little jazz and a lot of microchips.
   Beck filters his guitar through every gizmo money can buy, and
he jumps from one timbre to another for no good reason. The
synthesizers of Tony Hymas only reinforce the cold 21st century
ambience.
   The music works best when Beck settles on one setting and just
plays, which he does a few times. The slow ``Where Were You''
features a pretty melody but ends abruptly; ``Sling Shot'' is
propelled by reckless, scorching licks; and ``Day in the House''
offers a great guitar break and even a political point of view in
concise terms.
   But most of the rest is Beck dreck. Nothing here approaches his
fine '70s fusion albums, ``Blow by Blow'' and ``Wired,'' or his

<TEXT>
   Rob Lowe doesn't think anyone had a worse
summer than he did, except maybe the Dodgers.
   Lowe was trying to add lightness to a grim subject: his
involvement in a sex scandal and his efforts to resume his film
career.
   ``You have to have a sense of humor about it,'' he said. ``You
have to look at things in the long run. I knew that when this movie
came out, people would be reminded of who I am and what I do. That
is, that I'm an actor and I do have a private life, and everybody's
private life gets out of control at one time or another.
   ``We're all human. We all make mistakes. I made my mistakes, and
it got away from me for a bit, no different from anyone else. As
I've said before, I made a mistake, and I tried to live up to it. I
don't try to pretend that it never happened. It did happen, and we
all go on.''
   Every watcher of the scandal sheets and their television
counterparts knows what happened. While attending the Democratic
National Convention in the summer of 1988, Lowe made a videotape of
sex involving himself and two young women in his Atlanta hotel
room. Claims and counterclaims rebounded, and Lowe agreed to do 20
hours of community service to avoid prosecution for allegedly
seducing one of the women, then a 16-year-old. Her mother's suit
against Lowe is pending.
   The scandal is returning to the spotlight with the release of
Lowe's new movie, bearing the wry title of ``Bad Influence.'' He
portrays a charming drifter who invites a humdrum businessman,
James Spader, into Los Angeles' fast-lane life of drugs and
lawlessness. Lowe videotapes Spader in a sex episode, and Lowe is
seen in bed with two women.
   ``This is due to the totally coincidental nature of life
imitating art and art imitating life,'' declares Steve Tisch, the
movie's producer. ``It's almost life and art having a head-on
collision.''
   Lowe tried to minimize the coincidence of the two sequences:
``They work so well to further the story. They are plot devices.
The videotaping in the movie is to capture what happened in order
to get somebody. If (the story) had taken place 70 years ago, I
would have found a diary. Fifty years ago, it would have been the
audio recording. In today's society, it's videotape.
   ``It's used so widely as a device in movies today. Sure, I had a
videotape controversy, but when you consider all the movies where
videotape is used, it's not really that big a deal. If it had been
an elaborate sequence, we might have thought twice about removing
it. But then what would I use to trap him, if not that?''
   Curtis Hanson, director of ``Bad Influence,'' commented that the
sex scene with Lowe and the two women was necessary, ``because
through most of the picture, Rob is the force who causes things to
happen; we needed to see him as a participant.''
   Lowe was originally cast in the Spader role, but he opted to
play the evil Alex, fashioning him after classic villains from Iago
to Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko in ``Wall Street.'' The actor
usually creates his own ``back story'' of his film characters, but
not this time. ``Curtis told me you can't apply the usual
principles to someone like Alex; he is totally unredeemable.''
   ``Bad Influence'' was in pre-production when the Atlanta scandal
broke. Lowe was attending the Cannes Film Festival and returned
immediately to confer with Tisch about continuing with the film.
Lowe never considered withdrawing.
   ``We had to do the movie,'' he said. ``Everybody was committed.
It was still as viable a piece of material as it was before.
Nothing had changed as far as the movie was concerned.
   ``So I never looked back in that sense. It only made us more
concerned that we couldn't let what was going on in my personal
life affect my professional life. The set was the place to work. We
didn't want any distractions, or for me to be distracted. ... I
know that the performance would not be what it is without the
emotional ammunition I got in going through such a tough summer.''
   Whether ``Bad Influence'' succeeds or not, it's likely that Rob
Lowe's persona, both on and off screen, will never be the same.
During his brief film career, his striking good looks often cast
him as a somewhat wimpish yuppy. In his personal life, he was known
as a supporter of environmental and liberal causes and companion of
such beauties as actress Melissa Gilbert and Princess Stephanie of
Monaco.
   Lowe was born in Charlottesville, Va., and grew up in Dayton,
Ohio, where he surprised his lawyer father by announcing at 9 that
he intended to become an actor. He appeared in 30 stage plays by
the age of 12, then his family moved to Los Angeles. At 15 he
appeared in a TV series, ``A New Kind of Family''; at 18, he was
picked by Francis Coppola for ``The Outsiders.''
   ``St. Elmo's Fire'' provided his first adult role, as a
burned-out sax player, then came ``About Last Night'' and ``Square
Dance,'' which won him a Golden Globe nomination as a mentally
disabled young man.
   ``My only consolation in losing was that Sean Connery won (for
`The Untouchables'),'' he remarked.
   Unlike his co-star, Spader, who shuns the media, Lowe faced a
series of interviews for the film's opening and responded to all
questions. He was asked if his looks had been a drawback in winning
some roles.
   ``I'm sure it's possible,'' he replied. ``There are a lot of
movies being made today with guys who look like they could be
delivering your paper, just average guys.
   ``For better or worse, I have a distinctive look. I was born
with it; there's nothing I can do about it. I personally don't give
it a thought, other than when people ask me about it in interviews.
If I had a different face, they might be asking, `If you were only
five inches taller ...'
   ``As Gilda Radner used to say, `It's always something.'''

<HEAD>The Artists: Ancient Chinese Art Exhibit Wins and Loses</HEAD>

   Art patrons battling red ink and bad press
over an exhibit of priceless imperial Chinese art believe the
investment in prestige and tourism potential was worth the loss of
millions of private and public dollars.
   The ``Son of Heaven: Imperial Arts of China'' exhibit attracted
500,000 visitors during a five-month stint in Seattle in 1988 and
672,000 during it's eight-month show in Columbus last year. It was
the largest exhibition of historic Chinese art and artifacts ever
seen in the United States.
   The show, which opened here last March and closed in September,
featured objects from the palaces of Chinese emperors and kings who
collectively ruled over a 2,600-year period. The works were
primarily lent by museums in Beijing and eight Chinese provinces.
   The pieces included life-size terra-cotta horses and warrior
sculptures from the tomb of China's first emperor, 2,500-year-old
cooking vessels and temple bells, delicate scroll paintings from
the 15th century and a 2nd century jade burial suit.
   Some of the items were found in recent archeological digs in
China. ``Son of Heaven'' was China's term for its emperors,
believed to be the human link to heaven.
   ``Unequivocally, yes, it was worth it. To use a sports analogy,
maybe the score didn't come out quite like we thought and maybe the
plays weren't executed precisely as we'd hoped, but we won,'' said
David Baker, director of the Ohio Department of Development. ``And
we'd play the game again.''
   Despite publicity heralding the $66 million display of 225
artifacts spanning 26 centuries of Chinese history, sponsors in
both cities who had predicted respectable profits reported stunning
financial losses.
   Elling Halvorson, chairman of the Seattle-based Son of Heaven
Inc., said his organization lost $2.3 million, leaving creditors
and two charities that had pledged $1 million to the show, with the
debt.
   In Columbus, the show lost nearly $1.7 million _ almost exactly
the amount the state and city had pledged to guarantee creditors in
case the exhibit lost money.
   Baker blamed the loss on the high cost of renovating a former
high school to house the exhibit.
   The loss prompted some Ohio newspapers to delve into the
financing of the exhibit. It also focused more attention on plans
for ``AmeriFlora '92,'' the city's multimillion-dollar 1992
commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus'
arrival in the Americas. One local columnist already has dubbed the
1992 event ``Grandson of Heaven.''
   It also surprised Ohio legislators and controllers, who said
they never approved Baker's promise that the state would guarantee
$1 million if the show lost money. The State Controlling Board,
which approves many state contracts that are not competitively bid,
has delayed payment on the advice of Ohio Attorney General Anthony
J. Celebrezze Jr. He said such a deal was illegal.
   The city has paid much of its $750,000 guarantee.
   Baker contends that ``Son of Heaven'' paid off in other ways.
   ``My department's calculations show that more taxes were paid to
the community of Columbus and the state of Ohio as a result of `Son
of Heaven' than all the public dollars going into it,'' he said.
``That's not the way we intended to pay for this, but we're net
ahead on this. We're not behind.''
   But James Kraft, assistant director of the Whitney Museum of
American Art in New York, said he would have been surprised had the
shows made money.
   ``You can't do something like this for the first time and expect
it to be a success,'' he said. ``Look at it as a business _ very
few companies make money in the first two or three years of
operation. You have to do it once a year or once every two years to
make it work.''
   David Milenthal, a spokesman for Columbus Together Inc., the
organiztion that managed the exhibit in Columbus, said other cities
looking to build tourism and economic development by subsidizing
the arts should not be disuaded by the ``Son of Heaven'' losses.
   ``If it hadn't been for the renovation of the high school at a
cost $2.3 million for the exhibit, this thing would have made
money,'' he said.
   ``But other things we got from this can't be measured. We've got
a beautiful high school that's ready for the next show. We had
people come here from all 50 states and 50 countries, people who
wouldn't normally come here. There were hundreds of articles
written all over the world about the exhibit and Columbus and Ohio
_ all of them positive. You can't buy that kind of advertising.''
   Nonetheless, Milenthal, who is president of an advertising
agency, said that because of the controversy from the exhibit,
which was managed by his wife, Bonnie, he will think twice the next
time such an event is proposed.
   ``I enjoyed every minute of the exhibit and working with it, but
when you've been slammed as badly as some of us involved have been
slammed in the pasty few weeks, I just don't know if I'd do it
again,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Crammed into John Flansburgh's basement
apartment in Brooklyn are film reels, old framed portraits, brand
new Polaroids, used rugs, a box of punk 45s and a pharmaceutical
typewriter.
   A small statue of Chiang Kai-shek is perched on the
refrigerator. On the stove rests a large, scratched espresso pot.
The answering machine that activates the ``Dial-a-Song'' telephone
message for his rock group, They Might Be Giants, lies on the
kitchen floor, next to a shiny silver trash can.
   No gold records hang from the walls, but a used copy of the
group's first LP can be found slouched atop an old cabinet in the
crowded living room-studio that's squeezed between the kitchen and
bedroom.
   Flansburgh's lived there for years, near fellow Giant John
Linnell. They first moved in when the two-man band was just getting
started, playing to crowds that could fit comfortably into these
tiny rooms.
   But Flansburgh, 29, and Linnell, 30, are no longer college age
and They Might Be Giants is no longer just a college band. Sales
for their second album, ``Lincoln,'' neared 100,000, and they
should do even better with their new record, ``Flood.''
   The group is now signed with a major label, Elektra Records,
which, Flansburgh recalled in a recent interview at his apartment,
rejected They Might Be Giants three years ago because ``they had no
melodies.''
   ``Some of the songs are incredibly old and some of them were
incredibly new, and some were medium. It's your classic third album
syndrome,'' Flansburgh said with a laugh.
   ``There's this sort of obsessive of melodic thing,'' Linnell
said. ``We try and come up with a set of words that would be
interesting to use with that melody.
   ``I think we're really into our kind of music. There's a small
range of stuff that we feel we're actually good at. I definitely
wouldn't say we're making a point.''
   So don't look for duets with labelmate Anita Baker, or jam
sessions with Elektra's heavy metal stars, Metallica and Motley
Crue. ``Flood'' is more of the same, or the different _ catchy
melodies, quirky arrangements and lyrics both sublime
(``Letterbox'') and ridiculous (``Hearing Aid'').
   There is one change. Four of the songs are produced by Clive
Langer and Alan Winstanly (Elvis Costello, Madness), the result of
what Linnell reluctantly calls ``a compromise.''
   ``We wanted to produce it ourselves,'' Linnell said, ``and we
had never produced a record before by ourselves. Elektra said, `OK,
produce the record, but for the single we want to get somebody to
do it with you.' We went through a lots of producers and those were
the guys we liked best.''
   Flansburgh and Linnell both grew up in the suburbs of Boston but
didn't write songs together until 1981, when they happened to move
into the same building in downtown Brooklyn.
   Commercials nearly preceded commercial success. The two Johns _
as friends call them _ were on their first tour, at that ``tender
rock moment'' after quitting their day jobs, when they learned
Crazy Eddie's wanted to make use of their song ``I'm Insane.''
   ``You're in a van and you're making $75 a night, and you need
$80 a day to stay alive,'' Flansburgh recalled. ``Our manager said,
`What difference does it make? Take the money, it'll be fun.'
   ``We definitely wanted the money. We really had basic needs to
fulfill. That was very difficult to actually to go like `no' to.
But then we said `no' and they did this song that was based on it.
They pulled it right away.''
   Sponsors stayed away, and so did radio. But thanks to heavy
exposure on MTV _ ``Whitney Houston, us, Whitesnake, us'' was how
Flansburgh described it _ and a live act that featured pre-recorded
backing tracks and a most memorable stick, They Might Be Giants
built an audience, two minutes at a time.
   ``When we first started out, all our songs were fairly short,
had a verse, a chorus kind of thing happening, and there was always
a middle section to break it up,'' Linnell recalled. ``The middle
section was always the free range part of the song. I think 90
percent of all our songs still follow that format.''
   With enough money in the bank, Flansburgh and Linnell calmly
turned down the hamburger chain that recently approached them. They
can even afford to look back, reflecting on success that thankfully
didn't occur overnight.
   ``We get letters that say, `I'm starting a band and you guys
make me feel like you can start a band.' It's been a bumpy ride but
the cart has kept moving,'' Flansburgh said.
   ``We've been going for seven years doing this thing, and every
month has been a little better than the previous month, by some
small increment,'' Linnell said. ``We never had the frightening
`wake up and suddenly your lifestyle is totally different'
experience.''

<TEXT>
   Socialism has come full circle in 70 years, a
human life span, so a personal memoir may be just the right medium
for recounting its history.
   Heberto Padilla, Cuba's leading dissident intellectual, has
produced such a recollection in ``Self-Portrait of the Other,'' a
book he calls a ``moral evaulation of myself.'' It is also an
evaluation of socialism.
   In it, Padilla recalls his involvement with the Cuban
revolution, how his enthusiasm soured and how the revolution
punished him when he began to complain.
   Along the way he describes, with a condensed and powerful style,
some memorable encounters with figures of the day _ Jean-Paul
Sartre and Albert Camus, Che Guevara and Fidel Castro _ and
provides warm and respectful epitaphs for friends whom the
revolution mistrusted _ among them the poet Jose Lezama Lima and
the playwright Virgilio Pineira.
   Padilla's complaints led in 1971 to his imprisonment, beatings
and a public ``self-criticism'' session; the ``Padilla case'' was a
key juncture in the Cuban revolution and an axiomatic event in the
history of communism.
   Just as Stalin's show trials stripped many Western intellectuals
of their faith in Soviet communism in the 1930s, Padilla's
treatment disabused liberal followers of Castro of the notion that
his tropical communism was blessed with a special saving grace.
   A legion of prominent left-leaning writers _ among them Sartre,
Alberto Moravia and Susan Sontag _ signed a protest letter to
Castro.
   More importantly, the episode drove a wedge into the virtually
unanimous support that Castro had enjoyed among Latin
intellectuals. Among the defectors was author Mario Vargas Llosa,
who since has drifted steadily to the right; today he is a
conservative party's candidate for president of Peru.
   Padilla's generation was raised to view revolution as
inevitable, and to pursue it with ecclesiastic zeal, as if Leninism
were the Holy Grail. Most of the influential Hispanic writers
described in ``Self-Portrait of the Other'' had at least a brief
courtship with a communist party.
   Now that a more pantheistic array of ideas has sprung from the
shrouds of Leninism, the ``new generation of Latin American poets
are freer than we, who believed that communism was the only hope
for humanity,'' Padilla said in an interview from Princeton, N.J.,
where he has made his home since 1980.
   ``We had all those old communist poets from the 1930s _ Nicolas
Guillen, (the Chilean Pablo) Neruda, (Spaniard Rafael) Alberti _
riding on our backs. But those people aren't very influential
anymore.''
   From the beginning, Padilla spurned the lush, baroque imagery
associated with Neruda for a more lean poetics such as those of
Robert Lowell and St.-John Perse.
   Ideologically, however, he was keen on revolution. After
Castro's triumph he helped edit the literary supplement ``Lunes de
Revolucion,'' then went abroad, working as a correspondent for the
official Cuban news agency and as a commercial diplomat.
   A prolonged stay in Moscow quashed his hopes for socialism and
sharpened his sense of the pathetic, both in himself and others.
   In ``Self-Portrait,'' he describes being ignored by Castro
during the latter's visit to Moscow: ``We should have realized
right then and there the kind of objects we were: small animals of
history which someone superior knew how to make use of and then
discard.''
   Yet he manages a kind of sympathy for Anibal Escalante, a
hard-line communist who had lost out in a Cuban power struggle and
was consigned to a posting in the Soviet Union: ``When snow covered
Moscow, he seemed to cringe inside his black overcoat, like a
turtle in his shell. ... Fidel Castro had decreed his extinction,
and he was never able to bring himself back to life.''
   Padilla returned in the mid-1960s to Havana, and his book of
troubled verse, ``Out of the Game,'' won a national prize in 1968.
However, the authorities found fault in Padilla's sarcasm and
bitterness.
   In the grim state security proceedings that followed his arrest
in 1971, Padilla's aesthetic judgments were put on trial. The Cuban
government was announcing that it no longer tolerated the personal
criteria of its artists and wanted them to glorify the
self-sacrifice required by the fatherland.
   Padilla never spells out whether he regrets having made the
``confession,'' in which he also indicted more than 20 friends. The
reader is left to infer that he faced death or long imprisonment
had he refused to do so.
   Under constant police surveillance, Padilla worked as a
translator _ like the Soviet writer Boris Pasternak in an earlier
time _ until Castro permitted him to emigrate in 1980.
   Padilla hopes some day to return home, and with walls falling
around the world, he predicts that the one isolating Cuba also will
tumble.
   ``It will be sudden, like with Ceausescu,'' he said, referring
to Romania's deposed leader. ``I think it is inevitable.''

   What Johnny Carson is to NBC, Ralph
Emery is to cable.
   For the past seven years, Emery has been host of ``Nashville
Now'' on the Nashville Network. The live, 90-minute show reaches 48
million households.
   Like Carson, Emery sits behind a desk interviewing guests.
   But there's more music on Emery's show and much of it is country
entertainment. Virtually every country music star has performed on
the program, which is broadcast from Opryland USA theme park
9-10:30 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.
   Emery has never met Carson but respects him as a professional
and consistently good entertainer.
   ``I like him a lot,'' Emery said in an interview in his office
suite a few miles from the cable network studio. ``He's always been
one of my heroes.
   ``He's totally in command of every situation and I've seen
people try to trap him and nobody can do it.
   ``He has built that all important element, credibility, and
consistency. Carson can always be counted on to be entertaining. I
can't say that about every entertainer. Having guest stars on is
great, but you've got to be pretty good yourself every night,'' he
said.
   Like ``The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,'' Emery has a
live band, stand-up comedians and some audience participation
(cards from the studio members). He even occasionally does a
monologue.
   ``We do a little talk and a lot of music and that's the big
difference,'' Emery said. ``Our show has at least seven songs a
night and sometimes eight, and with interview segments under three
to four minutes each.''
   Emery also admires the exuberance of another talk show host,
Arsenio Hall of the Fox Network.
   ``He's very good. He has a very animated face, a great smile,
great eyes and lots of energy and obviously good writers,'' Emery
said.
   Emery and Pat Sajak worked together for a Nashville TV station
before Sajak moved to Los Angeles and became host of ``Wheel of
Fortune'' and his own late night talk show on CBS.
   ``I remember he was very glib and he was a big Chicago Cubs
baseball fan,'' Emery said. ``His personality reminded me of Johnny
Carson. I thought with his charm and personality, he would be an
ideal host for that situation.''
   On radio, Emery has had various syndicated shows since 1968. His
current five-minute country music radio program is on more than 430
stations. In the 1960s, his all-night country music radio show on
WSM in Nashville reached 38 states.
   For two years, beginning in 1981, he was host of a live country
music show on SuperStation WTBS, ``Nashville Alive.'' From 1974 to
1979, he was host of the syndicated TV show ``Pop Goes the
Country.'' He also is host of a live, 90-minute early morning
country music-news show on WSMV-TV.
   Last October, Emery was inducted into the Disc Jockey Hall of
Fame. In 1986, he was voted favorite cable personality of the year
in a reader's poll conducted by ``Cable Guide'' magazine. And he
has his own fan club with more than 5,000 members.
   One of his more celebrated guests on ``Nashville Now'' was
George Bush, who appeared in 1988 when he was vice president.
   ``He was very affable and charming and not stuffy,'' Emery
recalled. ``(Entertainer) Jimmy Dean was on the couch and cracked
jokes and made everything loose and light.
   ``When it was over, he took pictures with the TNN brass and with
me. And then he did an interesting thing. Just before he walked
out, the crew was just standing around. He said he wanted to have a
picture made with them, so he did. It's still hanging on the
bulletin board backstage. I thought it was a nice gesture.''

   Forty eight of the world's most gifted young
ballet dancers will be introduced to the New York dance world for
the third New York International Ballet Competition.
   Four rounds of competition begin June 2 with the Peasant Pas de
deux from ``Giselle'' at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall.
   The competition's first two weeks are devoted to repertoire
study by the 17- to 23-year-old dancers who will come to New York
from around the world. They learn three pas de deux that are
announced upon their arrival. They also rehearse a pas de deux
designated by the competition _ this year the Peasant Pas de deux.
   A gala performance and awards ceremony on June 25 cap the
world's only competition that requires the participants to stay for
the entire event. Even after a dancer is eliminated, he or she
continues to take classes, attends performances and plays an active
role in the final evening's festivities.

   Two key senators made similar comments Monday, suggesting a

   The negotiators said it is too soon to predict whether President

   Sales of cars and light trucks made in North
America slumped 7.9 percent in late February compared with last
year when consumers rushed to showrooms to snatch up expiring
incentives.
   For the entire month, automakers said Monday, sales of domestic
and imported automobiles and light trucks were down 4.7 percent,
reflecting sagging interest in cash rebates and low-interest
financing that were the rage in January and February 1989.
   The incentives in early 1989 turned many spring car buyers into
late winter purchasers.

   He's known as the father of financial futures.
But after 23 years as a leader of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
Leo Melamed says he's stepping down to spend more time with his
real family.
   ``They've always taken short change in my obligations and
responsibilities, and they always get left behind,'' Melamed said
of his wife, Bette, and three grown children.
   The 57-year-old chairman of the Merc's executive committee made
the surprise announcement Monday, telling a news conference he
wanted to ``smell the flowers along the way while I can still smell
something.''
   His resignation becomes effective at the end of the year. The
Merc board has not yet named his successor.
   The Polish-born Melamed, a tireless innovator and cheerleader
for the futures industry, said he was not retiring for health
reasons or because of the continuing federal investigation of
trading fraud at the Merc and the larger Chicago Board of Trade,
the world's two biggest futures markets.
   He said he planned to continue trading, to devote more time to
his trading firm, Dellsher Investment Company Inc., and to do more
writing. Melamed published a science-fiction novel, ``The Tenth
Planet,'' in 1987 and said he has finished a sequel.
   Melamed also said he expects the Merc to launch its Globex
electronic trading system, one of his pet projects, by June 30.
   Implementation of Globex, originally slated for the spring of
1989, has been delayed in part because of trouble in getting
approval from the Japanese government for Japanese companies to
trade on the system.
   ``It's going to create a real vacuum,'' John Damgard, president
of the Futures Industry Association, a Washington-based trade
group, said of Melamed's pending departure.
   Under the leadership of the charismatic and outspoken Melamed,
the Chicago Merc pioneered trading of financial futures that allow
investors to hedge bets on the future prices of currencies and
stock indexes.
   Before Melamed, futures exchanges were best known for trading
agricultural commodities _ eggs, livestock and pork bellies, in the
Merc's case. Futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and
financial instruments in the future at prices agreed upon when the
contract is bought.
   With the help of Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate in economics,
the Merc introduced the first foreign currency futures in 1972.
They gave investors the chance to bet on future values of the West
German mark, the Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar and the Japanese
yen.
   The contracts fueled explosive growth in the industry and
brought futures greater respectability in the financial world.
   Financial products such as currency, bond and stock-index
futures accounted for more than 60 percent of the 267.4 million
futures contracts traded last year in the United States. In 1970,
U.S. futures trading volume totaled 13.6 million contracts.
   The growth also brought controversy, though. Many investors
blamed computerized trading strategies that use stock-index futures
for accelerating the plunge of the stock market during the October
1987 crash.
   Melamed was one of the staunchest defenders of stock-index
futures, and his lobbying helped fend off Congressional efforts to
impose curbs on the market.
   Melamed was chairman of the Merc from 1969 until 1971, when he
stepped aside to become chairman of a new affiliate set up to trade
financial futures, the International Monetary Market.
   In 1976, the IMM merged with the Merc and Melamed became
chairman of the combined institutions.
   A year later, the Merc board created the office of special
counsel to the board and named Melamed to the position and to the
position of chairman of the executive committee.
   Melamed began working as a runner at the Merc in the early 1950s
while working his way through law school. He became an exchange
member in 1954 and a member of the exchange's board of governors in
1967.

<HEAD>American Express Takeover Gives Shearson Room To Cut in Private</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co.'s decision to acquire all
the common stock of its Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. subsidiary
gives it room to make broad cuts at the nation's second-largest
securities firm in private, analysts said.
   The shakeout continued Monday as Shearson said it is closing up
to 50 retail brokerage offices nationwide by April 1. Sources said
the firm also is trying to sell an ailing real estate subsidiary.
   Wall Street observers wondered why American Express would go to
the trouble of buying the remaining publicly held shares of
Shearson when it already had pumped $1 billion into the brokerage
and owned about three-quarters of its shares.
   ``The only thing they really said was it gives them greater
flexibility in solving Shearson's problems, though if you already
own 75 percent, how much flexibility do you need?'' said Lawrence
Eckenfelder, an industry analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   The decision amounted to a complete reversal for American
Express, which as recently as last month had planned to decrease
its stake in Shearson from 61 percent to under 50 percent to remove
the brokerage from its balance sheet.
   American Express has seized total control in an attempt to turn
around a firm that expanded wildly in the 1980s but has suffered
because of overcapacity and excessive spending during an industry
recession.
   It ousted former chairman Peter A. Cohen in late January and
replaced him with an American Express executive, Howard L. Clark
Jr.; agreed in the past three months to pump $1 billion into the
firm to shore up the its credit rating, and finally decided to take
over Shearson entirely.
   Analysts said the latest move, which involves exchanging $350
million worth of American Express shares for the 28 million
publicly held Shearson shares, does not eliminate the possibility
that the travel card company might sell all or part of Shearson.
But it ended for now talks on merging Shearson with Smith Barney,
Harris Upham &amp; Co., the brokerage owned by Primerica Corp.
   ``We're doing it to make crystal clear our very strong
commitment to Shearson for the long term and to enable us to work
with Shearson in using the capital we're providing most effectively
and efficiently,'' an American Express spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said ownership of all
common stock was ``the most prudent course of action in the current
environment'' but declined to elaborate.
   While American Express will own all of Shearson's common, Nippon
Life Insurance Co. will retain preferred stock that gives it a 13
percent voting stake in the brokerage.
   Taking Shearson private _ at about $12.50 a share compared to
$34 a share at the brokerage's first public stock offering in 1987
_ will reduce public scrutiny of the firm's finances. American
Express also said it will gain some tax benefits.
   Shearson insiders said the firm would be able to cut departments
and negotiate with potential buyers more freely than if the firm
were publicly held.
   ``It may be more geared toward when they want to get rid of this
thing,'' Eckenfelder said. ``Even if the business starts to
recover, I still think the idea long term is to sell.''
   If Shearson does not rebound quickly in an industry still
hurting from the October 1987 stock market crash, American Express
will have to absorb all of the firm's losses. But if Shearson
rebounds, American Express will have gotten a good deal in the
cheap stock, analysts said.
   Shearson is engaged in a broad review of its businesses. The
firm last week said it was laying off 2,000 of its 35,500 workers
by the end of the month.
   Sources at Shearson said the firm was cutting back much of its
real estate activities, including making attempts to sell its
Balcor subsidiary, which had 145 loans worth about $1.1 billion
outstanding last Nov. 30.
   According to federal filings, Balcor had $114 million in
nonperforming assets, including loans and about $22 million in
directly owned real estate. The subsidiary has just $10 million in
reserves to cover its portfolio of loans to real-estate
partnerships and client companies.
   A Shearson spokesman, Steven Faigen, declined to comment on
whether Shearson was seeking a buyer for Balcor.
   Shearson also said 45 to 50 retail brokerage offices would be
closed or consolidated with other offices. It said there would be
no disruption to client accounts.
   Shearson is the nation's second largest retail brokerage with
about 10,000 brokers at 600 branches nationwide.

   Despite a 7.9 percent drop in late-February sales
of North American-made cars and light trucks, the industry may be
stronger than some have forecast, automakers and analysts say.
   In fact, sales during the first two months of 1990, a year
forecast to be weaker than last year, are running just about even
with the 1989 pace, automakers reported Monday.
   ``All our business is doing great,'' said Frank Bartolo, general
sales manager of Celozzi-Ettleson Chevrolet-Geo in Chicago. ``It's
just what I expected. I think it will be strong from here into
October.''
   The nine companies making cars and trucks in the United States
reported Monday they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate
of 42,688 in Feb. 21-28, compared with 46,336 in the same time last
year.
   Car sales fell 6.7 percent during the period and truck sales
were down 10 percent.
   Automakers and some analysts have predicted sales this year
would be weaker than the 14.8 million cars and trucks that left
dealer lots last year. But that may be changing.
   ``Looking at the first two months of the new year, sales are not
only much improved from the fourth quarter but somewhat ahead of
the pace we anticipated when establishing our industry forecast for
14.5 million units in 1990,'' said Robert Rewey, Ford Motor Co.'s
vice president for North American sales operations.
   Auto analyst Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San
Francisco said she expects the 1990 sales pace to be roughly the
same as last year's, and Monday's figures, while for only two
months, back that prediction.
   ``I guess it's good news in the sense that there were some
people who were concerned that the trend for 1990 was established
by the sales rate of late 1989,'' she said. ``The market in the
last quarter of 1989 was very weak.
   ``The overall market in 1990 is going to be stronger than that.
I think auto sales are going to rebound at about the trend that was
established last year.''
   Domestic and imported car and truck sales for January and
February seem to indicate that. Automakers said sales during the
first two months of this year were down 0.8 percent from last year,
with a 0.6 percent increase in domestic vehicle sales offset by a
5.4 percent decline in imports.
   Normally, March and April are good car and truck sales months as
Americans shake off the winter and get ready for spring and
summertime road trips. That pattern was disrupted last year when
attractive incentives in January and February turned potential
springtime buyers into actual late-winter purchasers.
   Fred Voelkel, sales manager of Brown and Brown Chevrolet-Geo in
Mesa, Ariz., said he expects his new-car inventory to swell from
its current 75-day level to about 90 days in anticipation of a
springtime buying blitz.
   But Garretty said she wasn't so sure that would happen.
   ``I throw up my hands as to what the car-buying cycle is
anymore,'' she said. ``Incentives have changed things so much it is
really hard to go pick a time for increased sales.''

   Here are sales results for the nine major U.S.
automakers for the third reporting period in February 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were seven selling days in the period this year and seven
selling days last year.
   For the month, there were 24 selling days this year and 24
selling days last year, and for the year so far, 50 selling days
this year and 49 selling days last year.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and
appear in this table. Subaru began producing cars and light trucks
in September at a joint venture plant in Lafayette, Ind.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Hutton Ordered to Pay More Than $1 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An arbitration panel has ordered Shearson
Lehman Hutton to pay damages totaling more than $1 million to three
Oklahomans who claimed their broker made unuathorized trades and
churned their accounts.
   An arbitration panel of the National Association of Securities
Dealers ordered Shearson to pay $994,766 in compensatory and
punitive damages and lawyers' fees to Temple, Okla. farmer Walter
Earl Cox and his wife, Ardenia F. Cox.
   In a decision late last month, disclosed Monday, the panel also
awarded separately a total of $60,694 in damages and fees to Mrs.
Cox and her mother, Cuba E. Read, of Comanche, Okla.
   The toltal compensatory damages of $213,864 were trebled by
claims made by the Coxes under the civil provisions of the federal
racketeering laws.
   Both awards came in response to claims made against one-time
Shearson registered representative Lindy Kent Ridinger of Wichita
Falls, Texas.
   The Coxes' lawyer, Frank Lewis, of Phoenix, Ariz., said the
decision was the first he knew of where both punitive and treble
damages were awarded as well as attorney's fees.
   The NASD, which oversees the over-the-counter stock market, also
supplies the majority of arbitrators for brokerage-client disputes:
more than 3,600 case last year, compared to 1,100 handled by the
New York Stock Exchanges and about 100 by other groups.
   The three customers alleged in a complaint first filed in August
1988, that Ridinger and Shearson ``engaged in unauthorized trading
of their accounts; that their trading accounts were churned and
that the trades placed in their accounts were highly speculative in
nature.''
   Shearson denied the accusations and Ridinger, who was fired June
2, 1986, never responded to the charges, according to documents of
the NASD.
   Churning, which is illegal under Securities and Exchange
Commission rules, is unnecessary trading in a client's account,
which increases the broker's commission.
   Ridinger was formally censured by the NASD, barred from
associating with its members ``in any capacity'' and fined $50,000.
He was not reachable for comment.
   ``While we don't agree with the decision in this particular
instance, it has done nothing to shake our confidance in the
arbitration process which we feel is an equitable and efficient
manner to resolve disputes of this nature,'' said Steve Faigen, a
Shearson spokesman in New York.
   Many brokerage houses _ like Shearson _ require customers, upon
opening accounts, to sign agreements that they will take disputes
with the house to arbitration rather than court.
   Last year the U.S. Supreme Court, in cases involving Shearson,
upheld the legality of compelling customers to sign arbitration
agreements as the price of doing business.
   Several members of Congress have criticized the practice as
unfairly restrictive.
   ``What's important about this award,'' said Deborah Masucci,
director of arbitration for the NASD, ``is that it shows
arbitrators are willing to make such awards where the conditions
are egregious.''

   Under different circumstances, Rosalinda Caoili
would have been cleaning hotel rooms for tourists who provide
Hawaii with its No. 1 industry and help sustain her family of six.
   ``I love working for the people,'' said Caoili, a housekeeper at
the Sheraton Waikiki hotel for the past 14 years.
   Instead, she walked a picket line Monday while tourists at 11
hotels dealt with making their own beds and doing without prompt
room service during the biggest hotel strike in Hawaii history. Up
to 7,500 workers are on strike for better pay and benefits.
   ``We have to make a living,'' said Caoili, who makes about $8.50
an hour. ``If we don't do something, there will be a time when
these people cannot afford to live here.''
   Nearby, Joe and Jill Cody of Atlanta said that although they are
enjoying their stay, this has not been the Hawaiian honeymoon they
were expecting.
   ``The biggest problem is having to make our own bed,'' Jill Cody
said. ``They say they're going to try to clean the rooms every
other day.''
   Not all was bad, though: The hotel gave them a 20 percent
discount. Despite having to walk past lines of chanting strikers,
they said they are enjoying the palm trees and beaches that make
Hawaii a dream vacation destination for millions of tourists each
year.
   The walkout began Saturday after negotiators for Local 5 of the
Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union rejected a management offer.
Talks were to resume today at the behest of Gov. John Waihee, said
federal mediator Frank Shoeppel.
   The strike affects about one-fourth of the 37,000 hotel rooms in
Waikiki, the state's prime tourist destination, and one-seventh of
the 70,000 hotel rooms in the state, according to the Hawaii
Visitors Bureau.
   The hotels were using non-union staff and temporary hires to
maintain limited operations.
   Jeanne Park, director of public relations for Hilton Hotels in
Hawaii, said she has helped clear tables, clean ashtrays and
dispatch housekeeping services since the strike began.
   ``Nobody wins in this situation,'' Park said. ``When I see my
buddies out there on the picket lines, I feel bad for them and I
feel bad for us.''
   The union turned down a four-year contract that includes what
management calculates as a wage-and-benefit package of 7 percent
annually, but which the union said is more like 4 percent a year.
   Hotel workers who do not receive tips average $9.22 an hour;
tipped workers earn an average of $4.87 an hour.
   ``We can't afford to go on the way things are now,'' said
Roberta Bennett, a restaurant hostess at the Sheraton Waikiki who
makes $8.20 an hour.
   Bennett said she, her husband and their baby live in a studio
apartment for $600 a month. With her hotel job, a second job making
T-shirts and her husband's job with a tugboat company, she said
they barely meet expenses.
   Some tourists were unsympathetic to the strikers. Others tried
to pay them no mind.
   ``It's almost contradictory. They're yelling, `Scabs go home.'
But it's those `scabs' who are doing the jobs that bring the money
here,'' said Bill Carlile of Alexandria, Va., a guest at the Ilikai
Hotel.
   ``On a scale of 10, right now I'd give my vacation a seven,''
said Terry Klein of Victoria, Canada. ``They really don't bug me.
And if they've got a just cause, go for it.''
   Economists say the strike could badly damage Hawaii's economy if
it is long and if news reports give the impression the state's
tourist industry is paralyzed.
   Hotel officials stressed that all hotels are operating.
   ``Anyone planning a Hawaii vacation can be assured of receiving
the usual Hawaiian hospitality,'' said William Crawford, executive
director of the Council of Hawaii Hotels.

<HEAD>California Doctors Vote Down Ban on Medfly Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Medical Association has
rejected a ban on aerial spraying of the Medfly pesticide malathion.
   ``To date, there is no documented evidence malathion is
injurious to public health,'' said Dr. Richard Karlan, a Beverly
Hills surgeon at the CMA's annual conference, at which the measure
lost in a voice vote Monday of 450 delegates.
   ``We're using common sense here _ we'll be the first to respond
if we think there is a danger.''
   The state is spraying the pesticide to protect California's $14
billion farm industry from the crop-destroying pest.
   Residents of many Southern California communities receiving
almost weekly dousings of the pesticide have staged emotional
protests, some communities have gone to court and Pasadena banned
low-level helicopter flights at night.
   Dr. H. Rex Greene of Pasadena, who introduced the measure,
disagreed with Karlan and others that voting down the ban served as
an endorsement of malathion. ``I think CMA really doesn't want to
take a position,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, a Federal Aviation Administration official warned
communities against banning helicopter spraying of malathion. FAA
regional administrator Jerry Chavkin said Congress gave his agency
sole authority to regulate the skies.
   ``Actions which interfere with the flight of any aircraft,
including helicopters engaged in efforts to eradicate the Medfly,
represent a serious threat to aviation safety,'' he said.

<HEAD>Sharp Develops Color Fax Machine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Sharp Corp. has developed a desktop
facsimile machine that can transmit photograph-like full-color
images, the company announced Tuesday.
   The company said the fax machine is the first made for general
office use that can transmit full-color pictures, although some
newspapers use very expensive fax equipment to send page layouts
from one printing plant to another.
   The machine can send a photograph the size of a standard sheet
of typewriter paper over a regular telephone line in three minutes,
and can reproduce subtle color shades, Tsutomu Muroi, a company
official, said.
   The transmission time can be cut to about 20 seconds if the fax
is sent over digital communications lines, which are used by some
companies for telephone calls and data communications, he said.
   For each page, the cost for paper and a multicolor ribbon is
about 300 yen, o about $2 at current exchange rates, the company
said.
   In a public test between two Japanese cities Tuesday, the
transmitted copy of a photograph closely matched the original,
except the colors were slightly darker, Muroi said.
   The machine also can send and receive regular black and white
faxes, he said.
   The machine will go on sale in Japan in the fall for about 3.5
million yen ($23,000) and overseas sales are expected next year,
Muroi said.
   ``But that price is likely to drop quickly in the future, the
same way that prices for regular fax machines fell rapidly,'' he
said.
   Previously, manufacturers were unable to develop fax equipment
that could send color images in a moderate amount of time because
of the large amounts of color data involved.
   The new machine uses an advanced color scanner developed by
Sharp and digital image-processing technology to compress the image
information, Muroi said.
   Sharp also developed a way to cut transmission time by checking
only a sample of about one-tenth of the information sent rather
than the entire transmission, he said.
   An international standard does not exist for color facsimile
transmissions, and compatibility problems could occur if other
manufacturers introduce different systems in the future.
   But Muroi said Sharp is working on a worldwide standard for
color faxes similiar to current ones for black and white facsimiles.

<HEAD>Scarlett and Rhett Back Together to Sell Wine in Japan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a marketing marriage sure to make film purists
wince, a Japanese company is putting Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett
Butler on a bottle of wine.
   It's not the first time the characters from ``Gone With The
Wind'' have appeared outside of the printed page or silver screen,
and most U.S. fans of the Old South epic probably will never see a
bottle of ``Gone With The Wind'' wine.
   The new line of wines is to be sold only in Japan, under a
license granted by the owners of the movie, Atlanta-based Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., to the Japanese media conglomerate
Fujisankei Communications International Inc.
   Still, some people in the land of cotton wish this wine would
soon be forgotten.
   ``Don't you think it cheapens the book and the movie?'' asked
Hal Clarke, the lawyer for ``Gone With The Wind'' author Margaret
Mitchell's estate.
   For Fujisankei officials, the wine represents a chance to cash
in on Japan's love of American popular culture and the nation's
ever-increasing affection for wine.
   Katherine Melchior Ray, senior account manager with Fujisankei,
said the ``Gone With the Wind'' tie-in was a natural.
   ``We're always looking for high-quality, unusual American
products to sell in Japan,'' she said Monday. ``We see a demand in
Japan for more beers and wine. With the interest in fine wines and
beer and interest in all American media, we figured why not put the
two together?''
   The line of California wines was to be unveiled today at a
reception at New York's 21 Club. The wine label features the
familiar ``Gone With the Wind'' movie poster, with stars Clark
Gable and Vivien Leigh embracing against a backdrop of Atlanta
burning.
   Ms. Ray said TBS officials initially were reluctant to slap
``Gone With the Wind'' labels on wine bottles. TBS agreed, she
said, because ``we took a lot of care to show this was going to
maintain the prestige of the movie and encourage the beauty of the
scenes in `Gone With The Wind.'''
   TBS receives ``several calls a month'' from people wanting to
use ``Gone With the Wind'' in some way, said Lois Sloane, TBS' vice
president for licensing and merchandising.
   The requests are screened carefully and only those that properly
honor the film are granted licensing agreements, Ms. Sloane said
Monday from her New York office.
   ``We care very much about `Gone With The Wind,''' Ms. Sloane
said.
   Most of the products approved for licensing are geared to
adults, she said _ things such as commemorative plates, stationery
and figurines. Items such as toys and hard liquor have been
rejected, she said.
   TBS Chairman Ted Turner's fondness for ``Gone With The Wind'' is
well known. It is shown daily at the movie theater at Turner's CNN
Center in downtown Atlanta.
   Terms of the deal with Fujisankei were not disclosed.
   Attorney Clarke said the appearance of ``Gone With The Wind''
wine was unexpected. ``This came as quite a surprise to us,'' he
said.
   Clarke said he intended to examine the agreement to make sure
``it's on firm ground,'' but doubted he had any legal grounds to
oppose it. He said the estate has not objected to marketing schemes
when they ``promote the sale of the movie or the book.''
   The wine will go on sale in Japan May 1 and will cost between
$11 and $17 a bottle, compared to about $8 a bottle for most
California wines sold there. Currently most wine sold in Japan is
French.
   About 10,000 cases of ``Gone With the Wind,'' to be distributed
by Sanraku, are being shipped initially.
   Atlanta historian Franklin Garrett, who knew Miss Mitchell as a
young writer, expressed amusement at the idea of a ``Gone With the
Wind'' wine.
   ``I don't know _ `Gone With the Wind' wine sounds pretty good,
though it probably hasn't got the remotest connection to `Gone With
the Wind,''' Garrett said.
   ``I guess it's a compliment to the book,'' he added. ``But if
you get to using it too much for things other than the book, it
might lose its distinctiveness.''

<HEAD>Environmentalists Seek Tax To Pay For Repainting</HEAD>

   An environmental group is calling for an
excise tax to pay for repainting up to 2 million homes and
apartments and rid them of old lead-based paint that it says poses
a health risk to millions of children.
   In a report Monday, the Environmental Defense Fund said more
than 3 million preschool children suffer from lead poisoning from
paint in their homes, although such paint has not been sold for
more than a dozen years.
   The group said toxic levels of paint are found in many
youngsters under age 6 because an estimated 2 million apartments
and houses still have lead-containing paint on the walls.
   It has been estimated that the cost of ridding homes of lead
paint could be $2,000 to $10,000 per house, and the environmental
group said Congress should pass an excise tax on domestic and
imported lead to help pay for the work.
   ``We have built up an accumulation of lead from past uses that
will not go away. ... Lead does not decay,'' Ellen Silbergeld, a
senior toxicologist for the environmental group, said at a news
conference.
   In an analysis based mainly on government statistics, the
organization said children in scores of cities have lead levels in
their blood of more than 15 micrograms per deciliter of blood. That
is the level at which the Environmental Protection Agency and other
authorities believe childrn suffer some damage.
   High levels of lead can cause serious brain damage. But health
experts say that even low levels of exposure can cause decreased
intelligence, short-term memory loss and underachievement in school.
   Ms. Silbergeld said that while children's exposure to lead from
paint often was thought to come from eating paint chips, it is
widely believed now that paint dust, normally released from paint
as it ages, poses the greatest threat to children.
   The defense fund study said the greatest problem from lead paint
is in older cities and is particularly acute among black children,
who often live in older housing in inner cities.
   While nationally about 17 percent of preschool children are
believed to have elevated lead levels in their blood, ``almost 70
percent of urban black children from poor families are estimated to
exceed that level, as are 35 percent of white children in similar
circumstances,'' the report said.
   The group used national figures on exposure provided by the U.S.
Public Health Service and separate statistics on the age of houses
to produce an estimate as to what cities are likely to have the
worst problem with children exposure to lead from paint.
   This analysis showed 10 urban areas with roughly one-fourth or
more of the preschool children having elevated levels of lead that
exceeded 15 micrograms per deciliter of blod.
   The 10 areas and the percentage of children with those levels of
lead were: New York City-New Jersey metropolitan area, 33.8
percent; Newark, N.J., 30 percent; Jersey City, N.J., 29.3 percent;
Cleveland, 27.4 percent; New Orleans, 26.6 percent; Philadelphia,
26.4 percent; Chicago, 25.5 percent; Baltimore, 24.9 percent;
Patterson-Clifton-Passaic, N.J., 25 percent; and Trenton, N.J.,
24.5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Japan's Mitsubishi Industrial Group and
Daimler-Benz AG, West Germany's largest industrial conglomerate,
are exploring the possibility of expanding their business ties,
Mitsubishi officials said Tuesday.
   An announcement by Mitsubishi said the areas explored in recent
discussions included ``high-growth industries such as aerospace,
electronics and the service sector that would benefit from
development on a global scale and make effective use of the skills
of both groups.''
   Executives from subsidiaries of the two industrial groups held
talks in Singapore over the weekend.
   ``There was a far-reaching exchange of ideas about ways to
expand the relationship beyond the automotive sector where Mercedes
Benz and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have enjoyed close ties,'' it said.
   The announcement said senior managers from Mitsubishi and
Daimler-Benz ``expressed pleasure at having gained greater
familiarity with each other and agreed to hold further meetings in
due course.''
   Mitsubishi spokesman Kyosuke Mori, asked when they would meet
again, said they had agreed to meet once a year and he expected the
next meeting would be in 1991.
   The big Japanese and West German companies both make motor
vehicles and electronics equipment and are active in the aviation
and space fields.
   Mori pointed out that the four Mitsubishi companies and the four
Daimler-Benz companies whose executives participated in the
discussions were roughly comparable.
   Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes-Benz make motor vehicles;
Mitsubishi Electric and AEG make electrical systems and components;
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Deutsche Aerospace make aircraft
and aerospace equipment; and Mitsubishi Corp. and Daimler-Benz
Inter Services are in trading and investment services.
   Mori said the weekend meeting evolved from a meeting last
November in Europe between Shinroku Morohashi, president of
Mitsubishi Corp., and Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz.
Morohashi was in Europe to mark the offering of Mitsubishi shares
on the London and Paris stock exchanges, Mori said.
   Morohashi and Reuter led their companies' executives at the
Singapore meeting, the spokesman said.
   Mitsubishi Corp. is the core company of the giant Mitsubishi
Group of related firms and is Japan's largest trading company, with
transactions in the last fiscal year of $118 billion.

<HEAD>Japan's Finance Ministry Approves Merger Of Mitsui Bank, Taiyo
Kobe Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Finance Ministry Tuesday approved the
merger of Mitsui Bank Ltd. and Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., paving the way
for the establishment in April of the second largest bank in Japan
as measured by deposits.
   Masaaki Tsuchida, head of the ministry's Banking Bureau, handed
the letter of approval personally to Mitsui Bank President Kenichi
Suematsu and Taiyo Kobe Bank President Yasuo Matsushita.
   The new bank, to be called the Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank Ltd., will
be the second largest following Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. when it
opens for business on April 1.
   Since announcing the merger plan in late August last year, the
two banks have been thrashing out details.
   Suematsu and Matsushita, in a joint statement, said the new
bank, ``capitalizing on its broad networks in Japan and overseas,''
will try to maximize the effectiveness of the merger for the
benefit of its customers.
   Taiyo Kobe maintains the greater number of local branches in
Japan, totaling 363 at the time of the merger announcement last
August, while Mitsui has 228.
   The merger will help Mitsui Bank improve retail banking activity
in the country. Taiyo Kobe, on the other hand, can take advantage
of Mitsui's strong overseas network of 86 bases of operation
located in 30 countries, which include 16 branches, one sub-branch
and 24 representative offices.

<NOTE>EDs: SUBS graf 4, The foul-up..., to elaborate on paper returns</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   A human error has delayed tax refunds for
53,000 taxpayers who took advantage of the Internal Revenue
Service's much-publicized electronic filing system, the IRS said
today.
   Electronic filers affected by the foul-up who elected to have
refunds deposited directly into their bank accounts should receive
those refunds by March 12, rather than Feb. 26, said IRS spokesman
Frank Keith. Those choosing to take a paper check should have it in
hand by March 16, rather than March 2.
   ``Obviously this is an inconvenience to taxpayers and we regret
that,'' Keith said. He noted, however, that before this glitch, the
IRS had been processing returns at a record pace and certifying
refunds from paper returns in about five weeks.
   The foul-up affected only a portion of electronic returns filed
into the IRS service center in Cincinnati from the Southeast and
central states plus 250,000 other records, including some paper
returns filed from the central states, Keith said. He said the
error occurred at the IRS's Martinsburg, W.Va., facility, to which
computer tapes containing tax-return files are shipped by the 10
regional processing centers once a week.
   Keith said the problem was caused by an employee who delayed
running one day's work at the Cincinnati center through the
Martinsburg computer.
   More than 2.5 million couples and individuals have filed their
returns electronically this year in response to an IRS campaign
promising refunds within as little as two weeks. Nationwide
electronic filing is available this year for the first time,
although it still can be used only by taxpayers who are due a
refund.
   Under this process, a taxpayer completes his or her own return
or hires a professional to do it, and it then is transmitted via
telephone directly into an IRS computer. This dramatically reduces
the number of errors and saves the IRS time and money by
eliminating clerical work.
   The foul-up involving 53,000 electronic returns ``points up once
again the fact that our computer system is antiquated,'' Keith said.
   Under an eight-year, $8 billion plan now being implemented, the
agency's 1960s technology will be replaced by a computer system
that will allow IRS computers across the country to communicate
directly with each other. That will mean the agency will no longer
have to ship computer tapes by truck from regional offices to the
West Virginia center.

<HEAD>Va. Power Will Buy Electricity From Mitsubishi Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an effort to increase its output and meet
rapid growth in electricity demand, the Virginia Power Co. has
received federal permission to buy electric power from a $400
million plant that a subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. plans
to build in central Virginia.
   The deal was approved last week by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, according to today's editions of The Washington Post.
   Several industry experts call the deal the first of its kind in
this country: a full-size conventional power plant built and
operated by an independent company that is in the business of
manufacturing electricity for the wholesale market.
   The plant will burn natural gas supplied by a new 120-mile, $65
million pipeline that will link gas lines in Loudoun County and the
Tidewater, Virginia area.
   Traditionally, utility companies have built their own plants. In
addition, for the past decade federal law has required power
companies to purchase power generated by small independent
producers burning renewable fuels, but the Mitsubishi project was
negotiated outside the scope of that law, the newspaper reported.
   While the Mitsubishi plant falls outside the normal channels of
state-regulated utilities, the rate it proposes charging for the
power does not. Virginia Power and Mitsubishi have agreed on a rate
equivalent to what it would cost Virginia Power to produce the
electricity in a plant it had built.
   Officials said the deal should not effect the bills of Virginia
Power retail customers.
   Mitsubishi has agreed to bear the cost if it is forced to pay
more to produce the power than its sales contract allows it to
recapture from Virginia Power. The company is willing to take the
risk because it gains entry to a new area of business.

   The Soviet parliament today overwhelmingly
approved legislation that will allow people to own factories and
hire workers for the first time in nearly 70 years.
   In the early 1920s, Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin and his
Bolsheviks retreated from their drive to implement communism and
allowed private ownership of the means of production under the New
Economic Policy, or NEP.
   Today's vote by the Supreme Soviet was hailed by supporters as a
great step forward. It is one of the key elements of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform package.
   ``This is an enormous step forward because it lays down the
principle of pluralism in the forms of ownership and the basis of
their equality and their protection from the government,'' said
deputy Alexei Yablokov.
   After a section-by-section vote on each of the bill's six parts,
the legislation was given final approval by a margin of 350-3.
Eleven deputies abstained.
   The joint meeting of the Supreme Soviet's two houses broke into
applause as the total was announced.
   The section on the property rights of Soviet citizens, which
includes the right to own factories and other means of producing
goods, passed 354-0 with 13 abstensions.
   A Western diplomat watching the session said it would be the
first time since the New Economic POlicy that private individuals
would be allowed to own industrial plant.
   People have traditionally been allowed to own cars, summer
homes, and other personal property.
   The law also gives individuals the right to hire others to work
for them as long as their pay and benefits are in keeping with
Soviet law. Both the private ownership of factories and hired labor
are regarded in classic Marxism as exploitation of workers, and
were one of the key targets of Lenin's revolution.
   Despite its strong stand on property rights, the bill continued
to skirt the socialist bugaboo of private property. It makes no
mention of private property, but refers instead to the property of
citizens.
   ``It's unfortunate that there is no mention of private property,
but the principle is there,'' Yablokov said.
   Noted political commentator Fyodor Burlatsky, also a deputy,
said the bill was a good start but still inadequate to pull the
Soviet Union from its economic quagmire.
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, who chaired the joint
meeting of the Supreme Soviet's two chambers, urged the legislature
not to drag its feet on the bill, which is to become law on July 1.
   ``We need this law to go into effect fast,'' he said.

   Stock prices drifted higher in moderate trading
this morning as the market appeared to be looking for direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.91 to 2,659.46 in

   Trading in bonds and the dollar was flat this morning, providing
little direction for the stock market. On Monday, a declining
dollar and drop in bond prices weighed on stocks.
   ``Nobody knows what to do. People are nervous and looking for
direction,'' said Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at
Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``The market is suffering from a lack of enthusiasm on the part
of the institutional investor community,'' he added.
   The government reported this morning that orders to factories
fell 5.4 percent in January. The figure was in line with analysts'
estimates and had little market impact, traders said.
   In early NYSE trading, General Motors was unchanged at to 45},
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up &lsqb; to 40 and American Express
was down &lsqb; to 27&rsqb;.
   American Express closed down 1~ on Monday. Over the weekend, the

   They are only a tiny fraction of the prison
population, but their jobs are a distinct departure from the days
when inmates did laundry and made license plates or tilled the
prison farm. Now the focus is computers, and possible big bucks
when they get out.

   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   SOMERS, Conn. (AP) _ Most are doing hard time for crimes such as
manslaughter and rape, but for some inmates at Somers State Prison
``hard time'' means working with software.
   Eight to 10 hours a day, seven days a week, inmates in the
prison's computer class can be found hunched in front of terminals,
writing sophisticated programs that have saved the state thousands
of dollars and piles of paperwork.
   They have automated virtually everything that can be automated
at the prison, from school attendance records to pay schedules for
the 1,400 inmates.
   Their conversations are laced with terms like ``dBASE,'' ``XT''
and ``PC.'' They read all the computer literature they can get
their hands on, write articles of their own about the field and
share their expertise with other inmates.
   ``In prison it's important to fill your day, and if you can fill
it with something productive it's all the better,'' says Peter
Schickler, 45, the only one of the 16 inmates in the program with
extensive computer experience. ``I'd say 80 percent of the people
that come through will get a computer job, which, when you think
about it, is a whole different world from what most people in
prison are able to do.
   ``You'll find with a programmer, he's judged by how good a
programmer he is and not by his personal background,'' adds
Schickler, who is serving 20 years for manslaughter.
   The computer school at Somers was started in 1982. But under the
tutelage of Department of Correction teacher Carl Gabbert, it has
grown from a few small, unsophisticated computers to 15
IBM-compatible personal computers, all with the latest software.
There's a waiting list to get in.
   ``Nobody turns their life around until they've made a decision
to,'' says William E. Flower, a Department of Correction spokesman.
``But once they've made a decision to turn their life around, then
they need a vehicle. That's what this program provides.''
   A mainframe consultant before his 1984 conviction, Schickler
could be ``in the top one-hundredth of 1 percent'' of the computer
field in the United States, says Carey Prague, assistant director
of corporate finance at Travelers Cos. and a volunteer adviser to
the program.
   For 25-year-old Douglas Lavigne, computers have meant a focus,
an eventual career and a source of pride that he never had when he
was free.
   At 17, Lavigne was sentenced to 20 years for manslaughter in a
drug-related shooting and stabbing when he was still a high school
senior. While his classmates went off to college, Lavigne went to
prison.
   The Parole Board recently reduced Lavigne's sentence to 18
years, which means a possible release within a few years. Lavigne
is hoping for college and a computer career.
   ``I'm young enough. I got a second chance and I took advantage
of it,'' the soft-spoken Lavigne said as he demonstrated a
class-devised program that tracks health records at another prison.
   ``I got more hours on a computer than anybody else my age _
that's for sure. I can compete. I just got to get the old formal
education and then I'm all set.''
   William ``Toby'' Wright, who had a 10th-grade education and
worked for a dry cleaner and carpenter before he was convicted of
manslaughter eight years ago, landed an interview as a progammer at
Aetna Life &amp; Casualty when he became eligible for parole recently.
Parole was denied so it never went any further, but Prague said
Wright and the others will have no problem finding lucrative jobs.
   In fact, Prague, the author of 23 books on computers and a
consultant for Ashton-Tate Co., says some of the inmates _
Schickler and Lavigne in particular _ are so good they could easily
make annual salaries that top $100,000.
   Prague thought he would volunteer as a teacher, but, ``I found
they knew more than I did.'' Now he advises them on their futures.
   Most of the schoolwork has gone to computerize various aspects
of the prison, but Gabbert's class has also done work for the
outside. The class recently signed on as a test site for
Ashton-Tate, testing the software giant's newest products. It is
ideally suited because the work is rigorous and time-consuming.
   When correction officials decided in 1988 that the prison's
pharmacy system was obsolete, they turned to the computer class.
   Computer vendors had told the department that the equipment to
make the pharmacy efficient would cost up to $60,000 or more. The
inmates were able to do it for $13,500, and they trained the staff
to use the low-cost system without outside help. The computer
processes 300 prescriptions a day, produces labels, tracks medical
histories and maintains an inventory of 1,200 drugs, serving two
other institutions.
   All is not trust. The class instructor watches out for mischief
as well.
   For the computer whizzes at Somers, money is clearly not the
draw. The most they can make in prison is $1.40 a day.
   ``The word I keep going back to is `self esteem,''' Schickler
says. ``The whole reason that we're in here is to pay a debt, you
might say. I kind of feel good when one of the guys, someone who
has never touched a computer before, gets a job or a letter of
commendation. Knowing that I was a part of it gives me a lot of
satisfaction.''
   For Lavigne, computers may be the way he can restore the faith
he believes his family lost in him eight years ago.
   ``I put them through hell and back again, and I have to try to
do some making up there,'' he says. ``They stuck by me through this
whole thing, so hopefully they'll be proud of me some day.''

<HEAD>Pinnacle West's Board Rejects Revised Offer by PacifiCorp</HEAD>

   PacifiCorp said it will continue its courtship of
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. despite the Arizona company's rejection
of a sweetened $1.7 billion takeover offer.
   Pinnacle West announced Monday that its board had rejected the
offer by PacifiCorp, saying it was subject to a number of
conditions which sharply reduced its value.
   PacifiCorp's offer to exchange 0.88 of its new common shares for
each of Pinnacle West's 86.7 million outstanding shares of common
superseded two previous offers, including one in December for $8 a
share, or a total of $693.9 million.
   PacifiCorp's shares fell 37{ cents on the New York Stock
Exchange Monday to $22.12{. At that price, its offer valued
Pinnacle West at $19.47 a share or $1.7 billion. Pinnacle West
stock fell 25 cents Monday to $11.75.
   ``The board unanimously determined that PacifiCorp's proposal is
inadequate and not in the best interest of Pinnacle West and its
shareholders,'' said Pinnacle West Chairman Richard Snell.
``PacifiCorp's proposal is highly conditional and faces regulatory
hurdles.''
   A PacifiCorp spokesman said the company is studying its options
and that no decision had been made on what the company will do
next. The spokesman said the company is still interested.
   PacifiCorp said it had intended its offer to be friendly and had
left the door open for a complete restructuring of arrangements,
including a cash purchase of Pinnacle West's largest unit in place
of the proposed merger.
   Pinnacle West's subsidiaries include Arizona Public Service Co.,
Arizona's largest electric utility. PacifiCorp. is a Portland,
Ore.-based electric utility whose service territories cover seven
states.
   PacifiCorp has said it hopes to acquire Arizona Public Service
because APS' summer high power needs would complement the winter
high power needs of PacifiCorp's existing utility operations in the
Northwest.
   PacifiCorp's previous offers were made in November and December.
The first was approximately $1.7 billion for just APS while the
second was for about $2 billion for all of Pinnacle West minus
MeraBank, a troubled thrift which since has been seized by the
federal government.
   Pinnacle West never responded to the first offer, and its board
on Dec. 14 rejected the second, which was made Dec. 1.
   In rejecting the offer, Pinnacle West said it was conditional on
various terms, including the equity of APS, liabilities of other
subsidiaries and several regulatory matters.
   ``Our board strongly believes that the best course for Pinnacle
West is to continue as an independent company and allow our
shareholders to benefit directly from any improvement in the
company,'' Snell added.
   PacifiCorp said its latest offer represented a premium of 75
percent above market value. The company had put the premium of its
Dec. 1 offer at 52 percent.
   ``We increased our offer to reflect Pinnacle's resolution of its
MeraBank obligations, refinancing of its debpt and additional
analysis of the benefits of merging PacifiCorp Electric Operations
with Arizona Public Service,'' PacifiCorp Chief Executive Officer
Al Gleason said Monday in a statement.
   PacifiCorp spokesman Ed Grosswiller said the $1.7 billion of the
latest offer includes $2.1 billion for APS and $850 for two other
Pinnacle West and the Arizona company's debt of $1.2 billion, he
said.
   Pinnacle West last month reported a $551.4 million loss for last
year. The company said the loss was due mostly to discontinued
operations at MeraBank and Malapai Resources Co., a uranium
subsidiary.
   ``As to Pinnacle West's foreseeable future, I see a company
focused on a recovery plan that won't be accomplished overnight but
one certainly moving in the right direction,'' Snell said.

<HEAD>Pan Am Objects to Proposed Sale of Eastern's South American Routes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. has formally objected to Eastern
Airlines' proposed sale of its prized Latin American routes to
rival American Airlines, saying the deal would hurt airline
competition.
   Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest airline, said Monday it had
filed its objection with the Department of Transportation in
Washington. Pan Am asked the department to conduct a hearing on the
proposed $471 million sale.
   The transaction must be approved by the department and federal
bankruptcy court in New York, where Eastern filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors last March after pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists struck the Miami-based airline.
   ``In order to preserve the competitive balance in Miami, certain
specific routes that are a part of the proposed transfer (to
American) should instead be awarded to Pan Am,'' New York-based Pan
Am said in a statement. Pan Am asserted that it, rather than
American, should be awarded service from Miami to Guayaquil and
Quito, Ecuador; Lima, Peru; and Bogota, Colombia.
   Pan Am also said it should be given the Miami-Toronto route,
also included in Eastern's agreement with American.
   Pan Am said it objects to ``the wholesale acquisition of a
comprehensive network of valuable restricted routes, giving
American in one fell swoop an entrenched position at Miami.''
   American, the nation's largest carrier, agreed in late December
after months of haggling to buy the Latin American routes from
Eastern. The sale would reduce Eastern to about two-thirds its
pre-strike size.
   The transfer would ``convert Miami from a three-carrier,
competitive hub...to a two-carrier hub that eventually may be
dominated by American Airlines,'' Pan Am said.
   Eastern's other Latin American destinations include Guatemala
City; Panama City; San Jose, Costa Rica; Asuncion, Paraguay; Cali,
Colombia; and La Paz, Bolivia.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Trial to Determine if State Can Punish Amtrak for
Dumping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has scheduled an April
30 trial to determine if Florida can enforce state pollution laws
against Amtrak and its practice of flushing toilets along the
tracks.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton has set aside three days
for the nonjury trial in Jacksonville.
   The trial will decide whether Amtrak and its officials can be
sentenced in a state criminal case the railroad lost in December in
Palatka.
   The state charged that Amtrak illegally dumped raw sewage from
its trains, and that some entered creeks and rivers. A circuit
court jury found Amtrak guilty, but Melton issued an injunction
halting a Jan. 18 criminal sentencing.
   Amtrak's attorneys contend the rail service is exempt from state
environmental law and that the state laws interfere with interstate
commerce.
   The case stems from a Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission investigation into Amtrak dumping in November and
December of 1988 and May of 1989. Amtrak was charged with dumping
wastes into Rice Creek and the St. Johns River.
   State Attorney John Tanner, who took Amtrak to court on the four
felony charges because the specific dumping occurred in his
northeastern Florida judicial district, has said he will not seek
to jail any Amtrak officials in the case, but wants the dumping
stopped.

   The producers of Perrier sparkling water began
resupplying their distributors today, three weeks after ordering
the recall of 160 million bottles worldwide.
   The company said bottles marked with the words ``Nouvelle
Production'' would be available Wednesday in French stores and
throughout most of Europe, Canada and the eastern United States by
early April.
   The new bottled water will be available in the western United
States by April 22, Perrier said.
   U.S. importers plan to spend $25 million on a marketing campaign
aimed first at building anticipation of the return of the drink
that became a status symbol in the 1980s and then to rebuild sales
of the top-selling imported bottled water brand in the United
States.
   Ads scheduled to run Wednesday in 22 major-market or national
newspapers will use the theme ``Perrier. Worth Waiting For.''
   A companion radio campaign also will be used in the 15 biggest
markets that takes a humorous approach, using the format of the
Perrier News Network detailing reported sightings of Perrier in
various locations.
   A new advertising campaign is being prepared for use when the
beverage is in wide circulation across the country.
   Ronald V. Davis, president and chief executive of The Perrier
Group of America, told a news conference in New York that he
expects the first bottles of the new Perrier to start appearing in
New York in early April.
   He said the beverage will begin showing up in other U.S. markets
over the next 60 to 90 days. He said it will take until the end of
summer to make all varieties of Perrier available throughout the
United States.
   Davis declined to estimate what the cost of the recall has been,
but said Perrier normally could have expected sales of $30 million
during the four months it will have been either off the market or
in limited distribution.
   But at the same time, he said retailers have given about half of
the shelf space that Perrier would have occupied to other brands
distributed by Perrier Group, including Poland Spring, Arrowhead
and Calistoga.
   The recall was announced Feb. 14 after traces of benzene, a
cancer-causing chemical, were found in Perrier samples in several
countries, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, the
Netherlands and Denmark.
   Benzene, a naturally occurring chemical used in cleaning
solvents, entered Perrier's bottling line when workers failed to
replace a filter, the company said.
   Perrier said today that an international team of experts, using
``extremely sophisticated techniques,'' would ensure that the
mineral water henceforth was pure.
   ``Our task now is to serve the consumer, whoser patience,
confidence and understanding has deeply touched us,'' said
Perrier's president, Gustave Leven, who founded the company in 1948.
   The company said it had commissioned a survey in France,
Britain, the United States and Canada indicating that four out of
five Perrier drinkers would start buying the sparkling water again
as soon as it became available.
   The company said it had not yet been able to calculate the
worldwide cost of the resupply program.
   In France, unlike other countries, the recall was voluntary.
Some supermarket chains cleared their shelves of the product, while
other shopowners continued to sell it.

   Some drivers hired by Greyhound Lines Inc. to
replace strikers in the sometimes violent, 4-day-old nationwide
walkout have quit.
   ``There have been a few of them that have left, and we are not
surprised by that,'' Greyhound spokesman George Gravley confirmed
Monday after sources who refused to be identified said some
replacement drivers have walked off the job.
   In the company's central region, covering the northern third of
the country roughly from Pittsburgh to Denver, 32 replacements have
quit, the sources said.
   Unions representing 6,300 drivers and 3,000 maintenance workers
began the strike Friday.
   Gravely estimated that about 8 percent of the replacement
drivers had quit, or 56 of the 700 first hired, but he said the
departures occurred in the first two days of the strike and have
not caused the company to reduce service.
   An internal message sent to Greyhound reservations and district
officials said the company is being forced to lower its level of
service in the central region partly because of the loss of newly
hired drivers.
   But Gravley said the change was forced mainly because fewer than
expected replacements were hired.
   As for those who quit, he said, ``They knew what they were
getting into. These people were recruited and they were told
honestly and forthrightly ... the nature of the work. We told them
that there could be times when they might be intimidated.''
   Shots have been fired at a bus in Chicago, a striking driver was
killed when he was crushed by a bus backing up to get around a
picket line in Redding, Calif., and vandalism of buses been
reported around the nation.
   Chairman Fred G. Currey has said Greyhound can withstand the
strike in part because more than 6,500 people have applied to be
permanent replacements for the drivers. Greyhound maintains it will
be at full service before the end of March.
   Currey said 350 union drivers are at work and the company is
providing about 29 percent of its normal service, though that rate
is as high as 50 percent in the Denver area. The union said only 95
members have crossed picket lines.
   The strike began over wages and job security Friday when
contract negotiations collapsed. No full scale talks have been held
since.
   In another development, a judge in Portland, Ore., on Monday
barred strikers from interfering with replacements.
   ``The potential for someone to be injured or killed is
tremendous,'' Circuit Judge Robert W. Redding said. Six other such
orders have been issued nationwide.

<HEAD>South African Diamond Giant To Split Into Two</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., the huge South
African diamond mining concern, said today it would split itself in
two and base one of the newly formed companies in Switzerland.
   The move appeared to be an attempt by the company to minimize
its exposure to potential political turbulence in South Africa,
where a newly energized black majority has vowed to nationalize
major industries if it wins power from the white minority.
   But De Beers Chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson denied that there
were political reasons for the company's split, saying it reflected
the international nature of De Beers and the diamond business and
that it was in the interests of shareholders and the industry. He
also said the company's earnings jumped 37 percent last year.
   Thompson made his comments at a Johannesburg news conference to
which London reporters were hooked up.
   De Beers' shares jumped 1.80 pounds, or $2.97, to 13.63 pounds,
or $22.49, on London's Stock Exchange today after Thompson spoke.
   The South African company will continue to be called De Beers
Consolidated Mines. De Beers' foreign businesses, which accounted
for 80 percent of De Beers' 1989 net profit, will be grouped under
a Swiss company to be called De Beers Centenary AG, it said.
   De Beers said it would split itself by giving existing
shareholders one share in the Centenary company for each De Beers
share they already own.
   Ogilvie Thompson also denied that the decision was linked to the
failure of Minorco SA's failed hostile takeover bid for the British
mining company Consolidated Gold Fields PLC last year. That bid by
Minorco, which is controlled by De Beers and the Anglo American
Corp., was seen as a move by the gold and diamond mining empire to
diversify away from South Africa.
   Ogilvie Thompson said the plan had been under active discussion
since last year.
   De Beers said its earnings for 1989 came to 2.87 billion rand,
about $1.1 billion at current exchange rates, vs. 2.09 billion rand
in 1988. Revenue rose 31 percent to 4.2 billion rand from 3.2
billion rand.
   The company didn't break out quarterly or six-month results.

<TEXT>
   Raising the cost of postage isn't like
stamping a new price on cereal or changing the sticker on a car.
   Congress, which once had final say on stamp prices, surrendered
that authority in 1971 when it established the quasi-independent
U.S. Postal Service.
   But it set up a lengthy and complex system for rate changes when
they do occur.
   As in any business, postal managers keep track of their costs
and income and decide when they are losing money and a rate
increase is needed. There's no longer a taxpayer subsidy to pay the
difference.
   The first step is to go to the Board of Governors, a
presidentially appointed panel that supervises the post office
operation.
   If the board agrees with the managers, it votes to request a
rate increase and sends that plan, along with a detailed
justification, to the independent Postal Rate Commission.
   The commission, a separate presidentially appointed board, has
10 months to consider the request. It solicits comments from
individuals and businesses, holds hearings and conducts studies
before sending a series of recommendations back to the board of
governors.
   If those recommendations are the same as the original proposal,
or close enough that the board finds them acceptable, the governors
can set a date for the new rates to take effect.
   If the governors disagree, they can ask the commission to
reconsider, come up with a new set of proposals themselves or, if
they vote unanimously, can overrule the commission and put the
original proposed rate into effect.

   News writers for CBS radio and television
stations in four cities have ratified a three-year contract giving
them two 5-percent raises over the life of the pact.
   The agreement covers 325 news writers, editors, desk assistants,
researchers, promotion writers and graphic artists of the Writers
Guild of America, East and West, in New York, Washington, Chicago
and Los Angeles.
   Employees will receive an immediate 5 percent wage increase and
another 5 percent raise in September 1991, as well as increases in
various fees for special work, union spokesman Martin Waldman said
Tuesday.
   The increases will raise the average news writers' salary to
$951 by the end of the contract, Waldman said.
   CBS also agreed to provide special screens or hoods for all
video display terminals, and where possible, space the VDTs at
least three feet apart, Waldman said.
   The agreement was ratified late Monday night by a vote of 87.2
percent for and 12.8 percent against, Waldman said.
   Those covered include staffers at ``CBS News With Dan Rather,''
``CBS Morning News,'' WCBS-TV and WCBS radio in New York, WBBM-TV
and WBBM radio in Chicago and KCBS-TV and KNX radio in Los Angeles.
   The new contract is retroactive to last Friday when the old
three-year agreement expired.
   The guild ratified a new three-year contract with Capital

   The six Gulf Cooperation
Council member states are considering a plan to produce only
lead-free gasoline by 1995, GCC officials said Tuesday.
   The plan would involve the Persian Gulf states of Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates,
according to oil industry officials attending a three-day meeting
of petroleum refiners.
   ``Gasoline consumed in the U.A.E. will be lead-free by the year
1995,'' said Mohammed Abdullah al-Ojeil, head of the United Arab
Emirates team.
   Mahmoud Sayar of the GCC secretariat said that, ``All GCC states
now have their own plan to produce lead-free gasoline.''
   Qatar is to start producing lead-free gasoline by the year 1993.
Saudi Arabia has started producing methyl tertiary butyl ether,
widely known as MTBE, a substance which compensates for the lower
octane level of unleaded gasoline.
   Lead has long been used as an additive to improve the
performance of automobile engines, but studies have shown that it
is highly polluting and that in concentrated doses it can cause
brain damage and mental retardation, especially among children.
   Unleaded gasoline was introduced in the United States in the
1970s and has more recently been distributed in European countries
as well.
   The 11-member Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries, an all-Arab group of oil producers, has made the issue
of air pollution one of its primary concerns.
   Oil ministers of the GCC countries, which also belong to OAPEC,
have formed a working team to discuss the issue.

   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. lost $56 million in the first 20 days after filing on
Jan. 15 for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the companies
reported.
   In a monthly financial statement required as part of their
bankruptcy reorganization, the retail firms headquartered in
Cincinnati reported $236 million in sales in those 20 days.
   Federated had sales of $158.6 million over that span but lost
$37.04 million. Allied had sales of $77.3 million and lost $18.9
million, the statements released Monday reported.
   In financial statements filed with the bankruptcy court,
Federated and Allied stated their combined bankruptcy expenses in
those 20 days totaled $1.72 million.
   The operating loss before interest and taxes at Federated was
$55.5 million. That includes an operating loss of $45.4 million
from its 132 department stores, including Bloomingdale's, Lazarus,
Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdines and Rich's.
   Federated and Allied listed a total of $7.7 billion in assets
when they sought protection from creditors in order to reorganize
their finances, the biggest bankruptcy filing in retailing history.
   The companies were struggling partly because of billions of
dollars owed in connection with the Campeau Corp.'s debt-financed
takeover of Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   The unaudited results by division showed:
   _ Bloomingdale's had sales of $44.4 million and an operating
loss before interest and taxes of $11.2 million;
   _ Lazarus and Abraham &amp; Straus had sales of $59.1 million and an
operating loss of $20.1 million;
   _ Rich's had sales of $26.2 million and an operating loss of
$7.3 million;
   _ Burdines had sales of $28.8 million and an operating loss of
$6.7 million;
   The operating loss for Allied's 128 stores was $22.4 million.
Among Allied's retail units, which include Jordan Marsh, Maas Inc.
and The Bon Marche, only Stern's reported an operating profit _
$121,000 on sales of $17.2 million. In the other units:
   _ Jordan Marsh reported sales of $19.7 million and an operating
loss of $12.8 million;
   _ Maas reported sales of $21.7 million and an operating loss of
$5.9 million;
   _ The Bon Marche reported sales of $18.6 million and an
operating loss of $3.9 million.

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance in
European trading Tuesday, with a late surge against the yen and the
West German mark.
   Gold was higher.
   The dollar had eased through much of afternoon in Europe, but
dealers said it moved higher on a spurt of buying largely pegged to
speculative interest in testing central bank resolve to hold the
dollar down.
   The dollar closed at 1.7005 marks, down from 1.7035 marks late
Monday.
   The U.S. currency closed in Europe at 149.75 yen, up from 149.50
yen at the earlier close in Tokyo. The Tokyo quote was down 0.45
yen from the previous day.
   Bank of Japan intervention in Asian dealings had pushed the
dollar lower. Though dealers noted that even though the U.S.
Federal Reserve was spotted in the European market, selling dollars
for yen late in the day, the impact was minimal.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.4985 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.7450 French
francs, down from 5.7515; 1.9105 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9155;
1,254.75 Italian lire, down from 1,255.00; and 1.1866 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1904.
   In London, British pound was quoted at $1.6495, up from $1.6390
late Monday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $405 a troy ounce,
up from $403.75 late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $405.50 dollars per troy ounce, up
from $403.25.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.29 to close at a bid $404.73.
   Silver traded at a late bid price of $5.15 per troy ounce, up 2
cents from late Monday.

<HEAD>Trading Reform Tops Futures Industry's Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The panic in the pits has passed but not the
ensuing push for commodity market reform, a sensitive subject that
is foremost on the minds of futures brokerage executives meeting
this week in Florida.
   Last year's Futures Industry Association meeting was a tense
affair despite the traditional tropical setting as brokerage and
exchange officials fretted over the revelation two months earlier
of a trading fraud investigation at the Chicago Board of Trade and
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Since then, 48 people have been indicted and 16 have pleaded
guilty to federal charges of cheating customers, and FIA leaders
say the futures industry has stabilized.
   ``I think it's much more relaxed this year,'' said David Vogel,
chairman of the New York-based trading company LIT America Inc. and
vice chairman of the FIA, a trade association headquartered in
Washington with about 270 member firms.
   The 1,200 people attending this year's FIA annual meeting in
Boca Raton, which begins Wednesday, expect to hear from lawmakers,
federal regulators and exchange officials on their progress toward
restoring public confidence in the futures markets.
   Despite its problems, Vogel said the futures industry is
healthier financially than the layoff-riddled securities industry.
   Futures are contracts to buy and sell agricultural commodities
and financial instruments at a price agreed upon before the
delivery date.
   FIA Chairman David Ganis said talk about congressional
reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
federal regulator of futures trading, is likely to dominate the
meeting. At least 18 members of Congress, including some who have
proposed reform measures, are expected to speak at the convention,
most of them on Saturday.
   One of the most hotly debated reform issues in the
reauthorization process has been dual trading, the practice among
floor brokers of trading for their own accounts as well as their
customers. Critics contend the practice invites fraud; proponents
say it makes futures markets more efficient.
   Last year, the House of Representatives passed a CFTC
reauthorization bill that would sharply curtail dual trading until
futures exchanges demonstrate an ability to detect wrongdoing ``to
the greatest degree that is technologically and humanly possible.''
   The Senate is expected to vote on a similar bill this spring.
   CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm will address the convention on
Thursday and is likely to tout reform measures the regulatory
agency is pursuing on its own, including limits on dual trading,
tougher record-keeping rules and increased use of undercover CFTC
staffers in the trading pits.
   Leaders of the Chicago and New York futures exchanges also will
attend to discuss the progress they have made on electronic trading
systems that would supplement and possibly replace face-to-face
trading in commodity pits. Several exchanges also are working on
hand-held electronic devices that would replace the paper cards on
which traders record their transactions.
   Ganis, president of Chicago-based Northern Futures Corp., said
the Florida meeting will show there is no one-shot cure for
commodity fraud but that everyone in the industry is contributing
to a solution.
   ``We need to create an understanding that all of these actions,
not just a law here, a regulation there, but all of these actions
taken together will result in improved investor confidence in our
markets,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``That's the key
issue.''
   Exchange officials are likely to criticize the Bush
administration's budget proposal for an 11-cents-per-trade fee on
futures transactions, which they say will drive business away from
U.S. markets to cheaper exchanges overseas.
   Other issues likely to be addressed in Florida include proposals
to increase the margin, or down payment, on stock-index futures and
to transfer regulatory authority over stock-index futures from the
CFTC to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Both proposals stem from the perception that computer-driven
program trading techniques involving index futures inject harmful
volatility into the stock market. Futures exchange leaders say that
perception is erroneous.

   The U.S. Postal Service today began the
complex process of adding a nickel to the price of mailing a letter.
   With a record $1.6 billion loss looming in this fiscal year,
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank says the increase is necessary.
   The postal Board of Governors voted for increases averaging 19
percent and affecting virtually all classes of mail.
   The charge for first class is to rise from a quarter to 30 cents
next year, with each additional ounce increasing from 20 cents to
23 cents.
   Post cards would cost 20 cents rather than 15 to send. And rates
will also rise for advertising, magazines, parcels and other types
of mail.
   ``Even at 30 cents, postage is one of America's best buys,''
said Frank.
   That increase would be somewhat more than the rate of inflation,
said Frank, who promised to hold postal spending below the
inflation rate at least through 1995.
   Unlike a store manager, however, Frank can't simply slap a new
price tag on the goods.
   The proposal must go to the independent Postal Rate Commission,
which has 10 months to consider the request, hold hearings and
issue a report.
   If the commission agrees, rates can go up. If not, it's back to
the drawing board unless the postal service board of governors
votes unanimously to overrule the commission.
   Any rate increase would not occur before early 1991.
   But even though the process is only beginning, sides are being
chosen for the battle.
   Vincent R. Sombrotto, head of the 315,000-member National
Association of Letter Carriers, contends that stamps today are
cheaper than they were in 1971, if inflation is taken into account.
   Sombrotto held a news conference Monday to defend the rate hike
and to denounce critics of the post office, who have called for
private business to be allowed to compete in mail delivery.
   James C. Miller, who was federal budget director under President
Reagan, is spearheading the campaign in favor of private
competition. And consumer advocate Ralph Nader is trying to
organize opposition to the proposed rate increase.
   While first-class mail rates attract the most public attention,
new charges would cover all classes of mail. Groups representing
magazines, newspapers, advertisers and other large mailers will be
intensely interested in the proposals.
   Postal charges last increased in 1988. Frank has said he hopes
to have only one more price rise in this century.
   When the old Post Office Department was converted into the U.S.
Postal Service in 1971, it was directed to operate like a business
and break even over the long haul. The massive tax subsidy that had
been used to hold down postage rates was phased out.
   The postal service has posted five surplus years and five loss
years in the the last decade, finishing 1989 about $61 million in
the black. The agency had a $404 million surplus in the first
quarter of 1990, but rising costs are expected to push it well into
the red by the end of the year.
   Postal officials anticipate a $1.6 billion loss this fiscal
year, the largest ever for the agency.
   Contracts with the four largest unions representing more than
800,000 postal workers also expire this year, and negotiations for
new pacts are expected to lead to higher costs.
   Even at 30 cents for a first-class letter, American postal rates
will be the lowest in the industrialized world, officials say.
   First-class rates are the equivalent of 30.7 cents in Australia
and 32.5 cents in Canada. The rate amounts to 33.5 cents in
Switzerland and 33.9 cents in Britain. It is the equivalent of 40.5
cents in France, 42.8 cents in Japan, 56.4 cents in Italy and 59.9
cents in West Germany.
   Here is a rundown of the first-class rates in use since
universal rates were introduced in 1863:
   March 3, 1863, 2 cents per half-ounce.
   March 3, 1883, 3 cents per half-ounce.
   July 1, 1885, 2 cents per ounce.
   Nov. 3, 1917, 3 cents.
   July 1, 1919, 2 cents.
   July 6, 1932, 3 cents.
   Aug. 1, 1958, 4 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1963, 5 cents.
   Jan. 7, 1968, 6 cents.
   May 16, 1971, 8 cents.
   March 2, 1974, 10 cents.
   Dec. 31, 1975, 13 cents.
   May 29, 1978, 15 cents.
   March 22, 1981, 18 cents.
   Nov. 1, 1981, 20 cents.
   Feb. 17, 1985, 22 cents.
   April 3, 1988, 25 cents.

   Stock prices rose slightly today in light
trading as the market appeared to be looking for direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 11.49 to 2,661.04
at 2 p.m. EST.
   In overall trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed shares,
advancing issues led decliners by about 3 to 2, with 804 up, 570
down and 549 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 91.48 million shares.
   Trading in the dollar and bonds was flat today, providing little
direction for the stock market. On Monday, a declining dollar and
drop in bond prices weighed down stocks.
   Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said trading was quiet due to a
lack of market-affecting news.
   ``Nobody knows what to do. People are nervous and looking for
direction,'' he said.
   The government reported this morning that orders to factories
fell 5.4 percent in January. The figure was in line with analysts'
estimates and had little market impact, traders said.
   Among blue-chip issues on the NYSE, General Electric was down &lsqb;
to 61|, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up \ to 40&lsqb; and Philip
Morris was up 1 to 38&rsqb;.
   American Express was up &lsqb; to 27|, after losing 1~ Monday. Over
the weekend, the company announced plans to reacquire the publicly
held shares of its troubled Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage
through an exchange of stock.
   Texaco was up 1 to 60. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. upgraded the
rating on Texaco senior debt and preferred stock, citing Texaco's
continued improvement in financial performance.
   Pinacle West jumped 2&lsqb; to 13~. Pacificorp submitted a sweetened
takeover bid for the utility and financial company, but Pinacle
West rejected it. Pacificorp fell &rsqb; to 21}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.71 to 184.86. On the American Stock Exchange, the composite index
rose 1.43 to 358.11.

   The governors of the U.S. Postal Service voted
Tuesday to raise rates, including a nickel jump in the cost of
mailing a first-class letter, but there could as much as a year of
skirmishing before any increase takes effect.
   ``Even at 30 cents, postage is one of America's best buys,''
said Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, noting that U.S. postage
remains the lowest in the industrialized world.
   The proposal calls for the cost of a first-class letter to
increase from a quarter to 30 cents, with the price for each
additional ounce rising from 20 cents to 23 cents. Post cards would
cost 20 cents, also up a nickel, while Express Mail would go from
$8.75 to $9.75.
   Overall, rates will increase by about 19 percent on all types of
mail.
   ``We cannot ignore that increases in postal operating costs do
occur, just as they do in any business,'' Robert Setrakiam,
chairman of the board of governors, said after the vote.
   He estimated the increase would cost the average person between
$10 and $11 a year.
   Frank said the increases are needed because the post office
could face its biggest deficit ever this year, between $1.4 billion
and $1.6 billion.
   The governors' vote was the first step in a nearly year-long
process needed to increase mail rates.
   In addition to the first-class increase, the proposal would
raise the cost of mailing a typical weekly newsmagazine from 13.5
cents to 16 cents, while a heavier monthly publication would rise
from 29.7 cents to 37.4 cents.
   The parcel post rate for a 7-pound package would rise from $4 to
$5.06.
   Some rate cuts were included for specially prepared business
mail that requires little work on the part of the post office.
   The skirmishing over postal costs and efficiency began even
before the vote was taken.
   On Monday, Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the National
Association of Letter Carriers, contended that postage today is
cheaper than it was in 1971 when inflation is considered.
   But consumer advocate Ralph Nader is unhappy both with rising
rates and service.
   ``The people are going to have to save the post office from
itself,'' said Nader, who proposes setting up an organization of
people who use the mail.
   Business, which will feel increases most in terms of total
dollars, is also unhappy with the prospect of paying more. Tracey
Schreft of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce called the planned increase
``unreasonable and unjustified.''
   Robert Kamerschen, head of ADVO System Inc., the nation's
largest advertising mailer, said he was concerned that raising
rates would drive profitable mail out of the postal system when
it's needed most.
   The proposed increase would be somewhat more than the rate of
inflation, but Frank promises to hold rates below inflation at
least through 1995. He has expressed the hope that rates might have
to increase only one more time in this century.
   Increasing the cost of a postage stamp isn't a simple process.
   The proposal must go to the independent Postal Rate Commission,
which has 10 months to consider the request, hold hearings and
issue a repert.
   If the commission agrees, rates can increase. If not, it's back
to the drawing board unless the postal board of governors can
muster a unanimous vote to overrule the commission.
   At any rate, an increase will not occur before early 1991.
   While first-class rates attract the most attention, new charges
would cover all classes of mail.
   Groups representing magazines, newspapers, advertisers and other
large mail users are particularly concerned with any changes in the
discounts for large-volume mailers who do some of the work
themselves. For example, large mailers can get lower prices for
pre-sorting their mail, arranging it by ZIP code or even according
to the route walked by carriers.
   Postal charges last increased in 1988. Three years between rate
increases has been about average over recent years.
   When the old Post Office was converted into the U.S. Postal
Service in 1971, it was directed to operate like a business,
breaking even over the long haul. The massive tax subsidy that had
been used to hold down postage rates was phased out.
   The postal service posted five surplus years and five loss years
in the last decade, finishing 1989 about $61 million in the black.
The agency had a $404 million surplus in the first quarter of 1990,
but rising costs are expected to push it well into the red by the
end of the year.
   Contracts with the four largest unions representing the more
than 800,000 postal workers also expire this year, and negotiations
are expected to lead to higher costs.
   For comparison, postal officials report that first-class rates
in Australia are the equivalent of 30.7 cents and Canadians pay
32.5 cents. The rate amounts to 33.5 cents in Switzerland and 33.9
cents in England. It is the equivalent of 40.5 cents in France,
42.8 cents in Japan, 56.4 cents in Italy and 59.9 cents in West
Germany.
   Early in U.S. history the cost of mailing a letter varied
according to distance. At one time the price was paid by the
recipient, not the sender.
   When universal rates were introduced in 1863, they were for a
half-ounce. The rate was changed to a per-ounce basis in 1885.
   Here is a rundown of the first-class rates in use since 1863:
   March 3, 1863, 2 cents per half-ounce.
   March 3, 1883, 3 cents per half-ounce.
   July 1, 1885, 2 cents per ounce.
   Nov. 3, 1917, 3 cents.
   July 1, 1919, 2 cents.
   July 6, 1932, 3 cents.

   The board of governors of the U.S. Postal
Service voted Tuesday to raise postal rates. If approved by the
Postal Rate Commission, the new charges could take effect sometime
in early 1991.
   Here are some highlights of the rates being proposed:
   _First Class:
   First ounce rises from 25 cents to 30 cents, each additional
ounce rises from 20 cents to 23 cents.
   Post cards increase from 15 cents to 20 cents.
   Bulk first-class mail, presorted by ZIP code, increases from 21
cents to 26 cents for the first ounce. Bulk first class sorted
according to the route walked by the letter carrier increases from
19.5 cents to 24.5 cents for the first ounce.
   Discounts will be offered for bulk first-class mail that has
barcodes imprinted to allow the mail to be sorted by machine.
   _Priority Mail:
   Rates of $2.40 to $72.24 would increase to a range of $2.75 to
$85.75 depending on weight.
   A discount for presorting bulk Priority Mail would be
established, a pickup service provided and a new rate set for a
special Priority Mail envelope.
   _Express Mail:
   The price range of $7.75 to $89.05 would increase to a range of
$8.75 to $103.30 depending on weight. The letter rate would rise
from $8.75 to $9.75 and the 2-pound rate from $12 to $13.75.
   Volume discounts would be offered for the first time.
   _Second Class (newspapers and magazines):
   The regular rate, outside the home county, ranges from 12.4
cents to 30.2 cents per pound, plus 4.9 cents to 16 cents per
piece. That would change to 7 cents to 36.9 cents per pound plus
6.9 cents to 20.1 cents per piece.
   The rate for non-profit groups is lower, as is that for
materials circulating within the same county where they are
published.
   _Third class (advertising mail):
   Single pieces range of 25 cents to $1.50 would rise to between
30 cents and $1.77.
   Basic bulk rates of 16.2 cents to 16.7 cents would change to a
range of 14.4 cents to 22 cents, and a variety of discounts would
be available for extensive presorting of mail. The additional per
pound rate would increase from 48 cents to 53.7 cents.
   The basic non-profit rate of 7.9 cents to 8.4 cents would change
to a range of 7.2 cents to 12.5 cents, also with discounts for
presorting. The additional per pound rate would rise from 25 cents
to 33.1 cents.
   _Fourth Class:
   Parcel post's range of $1.43 to $26.61 would rise to a range of
$1.57 to $39.95.
   Printed matter's rates of 67 cents to $5.80 would rise to
between 86 cents and $5.74.
   The library rate of 64 cents for the first pound and 23 cents
for added pounds would rise to 65 cents and 24 cents.
   _Money orders would have a flat charge of 75 cents instead of
the current range of 75 cents to $1.
   _Post office boxes would cost between $25 and $200, up from a
range of $14 to $170.
   _Registered mail would be unchanged at $4.40, but the cost of
sending certified mail would go up from 85 cents to 90 cents.
   _The minimum collect-on-delivery charge would rise from $2 to
$2.50.
   _Insurance would rise to between 75 cents and $5.40, from the
current 70 cents to $5.
   _Special delivery would go up from $5.35 to $5.60.
   _Return receipts would increase from 90 cents to $1.

   Financially troubled Wang Laboratories Inc. said
Tuesday it will sell subsidiary InteCom Inc., a maker of
communication switching systems, to the French electronics firm
Matra S.A. for an undisclosed price.
   Proceeds from the transaction will further reduce the
financially troubled computer company's debt and increase its cash,
Wang officials said.
   ``We continue to make steady and deliberate progress in our
program to sell non-strategic assets to eliminate Wang's debt to
its bank group,'' said Richard W. Miller, president and chief
operating officer, in a statement.
   In mid-February, Wang's bank debt totaled $308 million,
spokesman Ed Pignone said. On Feb. 26 the company agreed to sell
its international lease financing operations. This sale will reduce
the bank debt to $93 million, Pignone said.
   The debt totaled $575 million last August.
   Pignone said Wang originally bought InteCom in a deal worth
about $238.5 million because the company believed that
technological trends in switching warranted such an acquisition.

   Futures prices for soybeans rose, while grains
were mostly steady at the close Tuesday on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   A rally in soyoil futures Monday, good soymeal business on
European cash markets and talk of Algerian interest in U.S. soymeal
helped send soybean prices higher, said Mickey Luth, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The rally in soybeans kept corn prices from falling
significantly, said Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations
for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Rainy weather improving the U.S. winter wheat crop kept futures
prices for that commodity from climbing higher, trader said.
   At the close, wheat was 2\ cents lower to 2{ cents higher, with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.82} a bushel; corn was \

   Stock prices rose today in light trading,
boosted by several waves of computer-driven buying, traders said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 24.10 to 2,673.65
at 3 p.m. EST.
   In overall trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed shares,
advancing issues led decliners by nearly 2 to 1, with 961 up, 507
down and 493 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.04 million shares.
   The currency and bond markets provided little direction for the
stock market. On Monday, a declining dollar and drop in bond prices
weighed down stocks.
   Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said trading was quiet due to a
lack of market-affecting news.
   ``Nobody knows what to do. People are nervous and looking for
direction,'' he said.
   The government reported this morning that orders to factories
fell 5.4 percent in January. The figure was in line with analysts'
estimates and had little market impact, traders said.
   In mid-afternoon, several waves of buying driven by computer
programs helped raise prices, traders said. The programs kicked in
when stock index futures jumped in price relative to the underlying
stocks.
   Among blue-chip issues on the NYSE, General Electric was up &rsqb; to
62&lsqb; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up { to 40&rsqb; and Philip
Morris was up 1&lsqb; to 38{.
   American Express, the most-active NYSE issue, was up &lsqb; to 27|,
after losing 1~ Monday. Over the weekend, the company announced
plans to reacquire the publicly held shares of its troubled
Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage through an exchange of stock.
   Texaco was up 1&lsqb; to 60&lsqb;. Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. upgraded the
rating on Texaco senior debt and preferred stock, citing Texaco's
continued improvement in financial performance.
   Pinacle West jumped 2 to 13}. Pacificorp submitted a sweetened
takeover bid for the utility and financial company, but Pinacle
West rejected it. Pacificorp fell &rsqb; to 21}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.45 to 185.60. On the American Stock Exchange, the composite index
rose 1.86 to 358.50.

   The president of General Motors Corp.'s European
division said Tuesday he hopes to reach agreements with
Czechoslovakia and East Germany this year to set up auto assembly
plants in those countries.
   Robert J. Eaton, in an interview with The Associated Press, said
talks are underway with both countries, but it was too early to say
whether an agreement can be reached by the end of the year.
   ``I hope so, but you never know,'' he said. ``We're early enough
in the discussions that it's just too early to predict how they
might come out.''
   He said the talks involve the possibility of establishing
assembly plants in both countries as well as producing automotive
components in Czechoslovakia.
   The negotiations are part of GM Europe's strategy to tap the
potential of Eastern European markets as the region embarks on
economic reform, Eaton said.
   GM Europe already has agreed with Hungary to establish a joint
venture there to produce 200,000 Opel Kadett compact cars annually,
starting in 1992.

<HEAD>Senator Says Administration Not Aggressive on Pension Enforcement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum said Tuesday the Labor
Department is not adequately policing the nation's $1.7 trillion
pension system and suggested white collar criminals are getting
preferential treatment.
   ``I'm concerned that our government isn't willing to prosecute
white collar criminals as aggressively,'' Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said
at a hearing on the government's pension investigations.
   But David Ball, who heads the department's Pension Benefits and
Welfare Administration, said several people have been convicted of
fradulent pension and gone to jail.
   Metzenbaum also complained about the Bush administration's plans
to fire the Labor Department's acting inspector general, Raymond
Maria, who has feuded with the department over its handling of
pension investigations and suggested changes to the system.
   ``You should have the administration cheering for you, not
seeking to remove you from your job,'' said Metzenbaum, chairman of
the Senate Labor and Human Resources subcommittee on labor.
   Maria, whose ouster is believed to be imminent, has said the
department improperly relies on civil instead of criminal remedies
in policing the nation's pension system.
   Maria also has said problems with the pension system rival those
blamed for the savings and loan crisis.
   But Ball called comparisons to the S&amp;L crisis ``inflammatory
rhetoric'' that was needlessly alarming millions of retirees.
   Ball said the pension system, with assets that have grown from
$290 billion to $1.7 trillion in 15 years, is a ``great success
story of the American economic system.''
   Metzenbaum called it ``a disaster waiting to happen'' and said
Ball's tenure at the Labor Department had been disappointing so far.
   ``I know nothing you've done except to speak out for the
business community to tell them pensions are going to be left
alone,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole has asked Congress to approve
funding for an additional 100 agents to police the pensions system
and is studying Maria's suggestions. She has also said private
citizens should be encouraged to sue pension officials who misuse
the funds.
   ``In effect, the secretary has thrown up her hands and said she
cannot do the job,'' Metzenbaum said. ``It is absurd for the
Department of Labor to say that they cannot protect workers'
pensions.''
   Ball defended the department's pursuit of civil remedies and
said criminal investigations are turned over to the Justice
Department, where he said they belong.
   Maria has asked Congress to, in effect, overrule a Justice
Department ruling from last year that prohibited inspectors general
from launching their own investigations.
   Maria is expected to be replaced by Julian De La Rosa, secretary
of the St. Louis Police Board.

   The currency and bond markets provided little initial direction

<HEAD>Kuwait Resists Moves To Raise OPEC Reference Price</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait is resisting moves by other OPEC members to
raise the group's crude oil reference price of $18 a barrel, the
Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabas reported Tuesday.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said ``intensive
contacts'' were taking place among members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries on the price issue ahead of the March
16 meeting in Vienna of the OPEC market monitoring committee. All
13 OPEC oil ministers are expected to attend the meeting.
   Iraq has suggested that OPEC should increase the $18 price to
account for world inflation. Libya also wants a price increase to
around $20 to $22, according to a report Monday in the
Nicosia-based oil newsletter, Middle East Economic Survey.
   The reference price, set by OPEC in the mid-1980's, was endorsed
at the cartel's last conference in November 1989. The cartel also
agreed on a 22 million barrel-per-day production ceiling for the
first half of 1990.
   Al-Qabas said Kuwait remains adamant in opposing any increase in
the reference price, preferring instead to see higher production
quotas and a higher overall OPEC ceiling.
   Oil ministers from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Iraq discussed OPEC
policy at a weekend meeting in Kuwait. A statement issued after the
meeting said the three were ``in complete agreement that their
countries should uphold OPEC's resolutions and its endeavors to
stabilize the oil market.''
   No other details were released.

<HEAD>Sell Insurance Division to Big Italian Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The BMA Corp. said Tuesday it has agreed
to sell Business Men's Assurance Co. for $285 million to an Italian
company that is one of Europe's largest insurers.
   BMA Corp. announced in October that it wanted to sell the
insurance subsidiary, saying it was too small to handle the
industry's falling profit margins.
   The sale to Generali-Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. should be
final in July pending approval of regulators and shareholders.
   The acquisition will give the Italian company a presence in the
U.S. life insurance market for the first time, said U.S.
representative Giorgio Balzer.
   Balzer spoke to employees Tuesday afternoon, assuring them the
company planned to keep operations in Kansas City, said BMA
spokesman Alex Matthews.
   ``He indicated that the company will be growing in Kansas City,
that they would be adding to the base that we have here now,''
Matthews said.
   The sale would leave the BMA Corp., which was formed as a
holding company in 1988, with interests in real estate, insurance
services and venture capital.
   It also owns 69 percent of Home Office Reference Laboratory, a
Lenexa, Kan., company that is one of the nation's largest
blood-testing firms for health insurance policies.
   Under terms of the sale, Generali will acquire 95 percent of
BMA's stock with an option to acquire the rest in four years. It
will pay the BMA Corp. $157 million and transfer about $128 million
in real estate investments and other assets from BMA to the holding
company.
   Generali will receive shares in Home Office and be represented
on its board.
   ``We believe this transaction is in the best interest of BMA
Corporation shareholders, both because of the attractive financial
terms and also because of Generali-BMA's continuing relationship
with HORL,'' said Tom Grant, president and chief executive officer
of BMA Corp. His father founded the insurance firm in 1909.
   He called the decision to sell the insurance division ``a
difficult one,'' but said policyholders would be well protected by
Generali's size and reputation.
   BMA sells life insurance and group health insurance in 48 states
and had more than $31 billion in life insurance written as of Dec.
31. It had revenues of $325 million in 1988 while the holding
company as a whole had revenues of about $500 million and profits
of $20 million.
   The company has about 800 employees in Kansas City and almost
1,000 nationwide, Matthews said. About 750 employees in Kansas City
work for the insurance division.
   The company sold its individual health insurance line and went
through a restructuring in 1988 because of shrinking profits.
   Generali, based in Trieste, Italy, has 56 subsidiaries in 40
countries. It had assets of $24 billion in 1988 and revenues from
premiums of $8.3 billion.

   New Coke, the reformulated, sweeter version of
Coca-Cola that inspired a consumer rebellion before sinking to the
bottom tier of soft drink sales, is trying out a new name and a
different look, its maker said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola Co. said it plans to test market new Coke under the
name Coke II. Spokesman Randy Donaldson said Coke II would be sold
initially in one city, which he would not identify, within the next
few months.
   The formula of the newly named drink will not be changed,
Donaldson said.
   Industry observers speculated that if the new name was adopted,
the company could return the Coca-Cola brand name to the original
formula, now called Coke Classic.
   Jesse Meyers, the Greenwich, Conn., publisher of the industry
newsletter Beverage Digest, said the Coke II test marks the first
big shot of the 1990s in the cola wars between Coca-Cola and
archrival Pepsi Cola.
   Meyers said he has seen the proposed packaging for Coke II, and
its red, white and blue design with blue lettering closely
resembles that of Pepsi. Coke's Donaldson said the Coke II can is
red, white and blue, but unlike Pepsi it has a red background with
white letters and a blue outline.
   The Coke II test comes as new Coke, regarded by some as one of
the great blunders in marketing history, nears its fifth
anniversary.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced in April 1985 that after
extensive taste tests it was changing the formula of Coke, the
world's best-selling soft drink. Consumer reaction against the new,
sweeter-tasting product was so strong that the company two months
later apologized and brought back the original formula under the
name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Coke Classic regained the position as the No. 1 soft drink. New
Coke also remained, but its market share now is a relatively tiny
1.4 percent compared to Coke Classic's 20 percent share.
   Coke officials always have maintained that new Coke, despite its
Coca-Cola label, essentially is a new product and that its sales
should be judged in that respect.
   Donaldson denied that the Coke II test means the company is
running up the white flag on new Coke.
   ``After five years, new Coke is no longer new, though it's still
called new Coke,'' he said. ``We just want to make it easier to
distinguish between Coke II and Coke Classic.''
   And he said there are no plans to change the name of Coca-Cola
Classic back to Coca-Cola. ``There are no plans to change anything
about Coke Classic at all,'' he said.
   But Meyers, a respected observer of the soft drink industry
said, ``The name Coke Classic may be on the way out.''
   Emanuel Goldman, who follows the soft drink industry for Paine
Webber Inc. in San Francisco, said the Coke II label, if adopted,
would remove the perception that new Coke is a failure.
   Coca-Cola is ``the premier brand name in the world,'' he said.
   ``You don't want something called Coca-Cola that doesn't work,
so you call it Coke II,'' Goldman said. ``I think it's not such a
bad thing to do. The name of the game is Coca-Cola.''
   Pepsi spokesman Tod MacKenzie called the Coke II test an
acknowledgement by Coke that Pepsi was a superior product.
   ``Whether it's Coke II or new new Coke, it's another validation
of Coke's interest in the great taste of Pepsi,'' MacKenzie said
from his office in Purchase, N.Y.
   ``This isn't the first time they've tried to imitate us, and it
likely won't be the last,'' he said.
   Coke's recent advertising has pitted diet Coke, rather than
Coca-Cola or Coke Classic, against Pepsi.
   Meyers said he expected Coca-Cola now wants to position Coke II
against its competitor.
   ``They've had a very subtle approach,'' he said. ``If this
approach works, they'll go to a gross all-out attack.''

<HEAD>Livestock Futures Higher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most livestock and meat futures rose strongly Tuesday on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, helped by short-term demand and
favorable shipping weather.
   On other futures markets, soybeans soared, grains were mixed,
while oil products, precious metals and coffee all dipped.
   A higher-than-expected cash market and a belief that Monday's
futures market was oversold pushed pork prices higher, said Phil
Stanley, a trader-consultant.
   Contract highs were set on live hog futures for delivery in
June, July, August, October and December.
   An improvement in weather conditions for animal movement in the
U.S. Midwest was credited for better cattle prices, said analyst
Paul Hare of Linnco Futures Inc.
   Cattle settled .05 cent lower to .27 cent higher, with the
contract for delivery in April at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .37 cent to .55 cent higher, with March at 81.35 cents
a pound; hogs were .25 cent to .85 cent higher, with April at 50.32
cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to 2.00 cent
higher, with March at 48.27 cents a pound.
   Futures prices for soybeans rose, while grains were mixed at the
close Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A rally in soyoil futures Monday, good soymeal business on
European cash markets and talk of Algerian interest in U.S. soymeal
helped send soybean prices higher, said Mickey Luth, an analyst
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The soybean contract for delivery in March was at a seven-week
high, closing up 7 cents.
   The rally in soybeans kept corn prices from falling
significantly, said Jerry Zusel, manager of CBOT floor operations
for Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Rainy weather improving the U.S. winter wheat crop and lack of
large-volume export business depressed futures prices for that
commodity, traders said.
   Wheat settled 3} cents lower to 2{ cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.81\ a bushel; corn was } cent
to 1{ cent lower, with March at $2.44 a bushel; oats were \ cent
lower to 1} cents higher, with March at $1.45} a bushel; and
soybeans were 5{ cents to 7{ cents higher, with March at $5.77} a
bushel.
   Oil products sank lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Peter Cardillo, commodity adviser with Josephthal &amp; Co., said a
build up of stocks, especialy gasoline, weighed on futures trading.
   Crude oil settled 12 cents to 28 cents lower, with the contract
for delivery in April at $21.30 a barrel; heating oil was .68 cent
to .98 cent lower, with April at 57.22 cents a gallon; and unleaded
gasoline was .45 cent to 1.51 cents lower, with April at 57.79
cents a gallon.
   Precious metals prices were down slightly on the Commodity
Exchange in New York.
   A slight rally early in the session was erased when the U.S.
dollar strengthened against foreign currencies, Cardillo said.
   Gold and the U.S. dollar prices normally in opposite directions.
   Gold settled 30 cents to 50 cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in March at $403.60 a troy ounce; and silver was .1 cent
to .2 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in March at $5.12
a troy ounce.
   Coffee futures closed lower after a volatile session on the
Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
   Prices whipped higher then lower on profit-taking and differing
views over supply. On Monday, March coffee had hit an eight-month
high.
   On Tuesday, coffee settled 1.75 cents to 3.83 cents lower, with
the contract for March at $1.01 a pound.

   World exports of coffee jumped by nearly 25
percent last year after international controls on sales were
abolished in July, the International Coffee Organization said
Tuesday.
   Exports to all destinations in the last half of 1989 totaled
39.6 million bags, compared with 31.9 million in the comparative
period of 1988, the organization reported.
   One bag equals 60 kilos or 132 pounds.
   The July-December exports brought total sales for 1989 to 73.2
million bags, up from 65.2 million in 1988, when the coffee
organization's system of export quotas was limiting supplies to
prop up prices.
   The quota system was abandoned on July 4 when producer and
consumer member governments failed to agree on the terms for its
continuation.
   In the sales free-for-all that followed, the wholesale price of
coffee collapsed and hit a 14-year low earlier this year.
   Brazil lifted its exports in 1989 to 18.269 million bags from
17.082 million in 1988 and Colombian shipments rose to 10.828
million from 9.784 million.
   Most other countries recording sharp improvements were Latin
American producers of the prized mild arabica variety of bean.
   Mexican exports last year rose to 4.427 million bags from 2.775
million in 1988, Guatemala's were up at 3.067 million from 2.479
million and Costa Rica's at 2.302 million from 2.019 million.
   Other export totals included Ecuador 1.747 million bags from
1.404 million, Peru 1.432 million from 825 million, Honduras 1.420
million from 1.263 million, Nicaragua 606 million from 549 million
and the Dominican Republic 530 million from 439 million.
   El Salvador was one of the region's few big producers to record
a drop in exports at 1.603 million bags from 2.051 million.
   There was little change in exports of the less popular robusta
coffee variety, apart from increased sales by Indonesia which
shipped 5.423 million bags, compared with 4.994 million.
   Ivory Coast shipments dropped last year to 2.623 million bags
from 3.660 million in 1988 and it was overtaken as Africa's biggest
exporter by Uganda, which shipped 2.937 million bags against 2.404
million in 1988.
   Exports by Cameroon fell to 1.317 million bags from 1.633
million, while Zaire was up at 1.372 million from 915,000.
   Other exports by leading producers included Kenya with 1.739
million bags from 1.383 million, Ethiopia 1.699 million from 1.408
million, Papua New Guinea 1.317 million from 748 million and
Tanzania 822 million from 613 million.

   The dollar was mixed Tuesday, closing mostly
higher in domestic trading after falling overseas in the absence of
any major developments to move the foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   The dollar declined in early going due to trader speculation
that an interest rate hike in Japan, which would bolster the yen
against the dollar, was imminent. When the increase never
materialized, the dollar recovered some ground in Europe, although
still closed down from Monday's levels.
   The dollar then moved higher against most currencies in New York.
   Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader with Bank of New
York Co., said the market shied away from testing the upper end of
the dollar's trading range, the point at which central banks,
including the Federal Reserve, would be expected to step in and try
to push the dollar down.
   The Bank of Japan intervened in Asian dealings overnight,
selling the dollar lower. Dealers said the Fed sold dollars for yen
late in the day in the European market, but the impact was minimal.
   The dollar closed in New York at 149.85 yen, up from Monday's
149.025 yen. In Europe, it closed at 149.75 yen after slipping 0.45
yen in earlier Tokyo trading to 149.50 yen.
   Ryan said traders generally were awaiting the Labor Department's
employment report for February, scheduled for release on Friday.
The market expected the nation's non-farm payroll to have expanded
by 225,000 jobs, indicating that the economy is stronger than many
have thought.
   Such a report is expected to move the dollar higher because the
Fed is less likely to nudge U.S. interest rates downward _ which
would diminish returns on dollar-denominated investments _ when the
economy shows signs of strength.
   The dollar fell against the British pound Tuesday. In New York,
sterling was quoted at $1.6475, up from $1.6445 late Monday, and in
earlier London dealings, it rose to $1.6495 from $1.6390.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.7035 West German marks, up from 1.6970; 1.5000
Swiss francs, up from 1.4970; 5.7565 French francs, up from 5.7330;
1,257.00 Italian lire, up from 1,252.00; and 1.18565 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.18905.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday's
prices, included: 1.7005 West German marks, down from 1.7035;
1.4985 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.7450 French francs, down from
5.7515; 1.9105 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9155; 1,254.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,255.00; and 1.1866 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1904.
   Gold fell in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for
current delivery fell 50 cents a troy ounce to $403.60, and
Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $403.45 a troy ounce,
down 85 cents from Monday.
   Gold traded earlier in London at a late bid of $405 a troy
ounce, up from $403.75 late Monday. In Zurich, the bid was $405.50
per troy ounce, up from $403.25.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.29 to close at a bid of $404.73 an
ounce.
   Silver was unchanged on New York's Comex, closing at $5.116 a
troy ounce. In London, silver traded at a late bid of $5.15 per
troy ounce, up 2 cents from Monday.

   The Associated Press erroneously reported March 2
that Ryder System Inc. Chairman M. Anthony Burns predicted the
company would post a first-quarter loss.
   Burns actually said the company's net earnings in the first
quarter likely would be lower than first-quarter net income in 1989.
   Also, the company sold off four subsidiaries in 1989, not three,
and the company's divisions did not post a loss for that year,
although their earnings were lower than the previous year's
earnings.

   Paramount Communications Inc. reported Tuesday
its first-quarter profit tumbled 69.4 percent from results a year
earlier that included a big contribution from a financial services
company that has since been sold.
   The publishing and entertainment giant said its earnings rose
81.2 percent in comparison with earnings from continuing operations
last year, excluding the results from The Associates financial
services unit.
   Paramount said it earned $21.2 million, or 17 cents a share, in
the three months ended Jan. 31 compared with earnings of $69.2
million, or 58 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The first-quarter 1989 results included $57.5 million, or 48
cents a share, from discontinued operations, mainly from The
Associates, which was sold in October for $3.35 billion to Ford
Motor Co.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 9.3 percent to $844.6 million from
$773.1 million a year ago.
   The latest results include net interest income of $37.9 million,
mainly from the investment of proceeds of The Associates sale.
   Martin S. Davis, chairman and chief executive, said he expects
the company will earn between $2.10 a share and $2.60 a share for
the year.
   The company said its operating income from entertainment was
lower despite a sharp gain in television operations, because
contributions from motion pictures failed to match strong results a
year ago.
   Gains in television results stemmed mainly from higher operating
income from home video operations, the success of ``The Arsenio
Hall Show'' and ``Entertainment Tonight,'' and increased
contributions from Paramount's 50 percent interest in USA Network.
   The company posted a larger operating loss in publishing than a
year ago, reflecting the impact of more conservative accounting
procedures adopted in the fourth quarter of 1989.
   Gains in higher education, consumer and international publishing
operations were more than offset by seasonal losses in school and
supplementary education operations, lower earnings in professional
information, lower royalty income related to the Silhouette romance
book line and higher operating expenses.

   Stock prices rose broadly Tuesday in quiet
trading, boosted by several waves of computer-driven buying and
strength in dollar-trading and the bond market, traders said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 27.25 to 2,676.80.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by more than 2 to 1
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 1,028 up, 489 down and 484 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Board volume totaled 143.64 million
shares, up from 140.11 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 175.55 million shares.
   The currency and bond markets provided little initial direction
for the stock market, and stock prices drifted slightly higher. But
in the early afternoon, the dollar strengthened, bond prices rose
and the buy programs kicked in.
   ``You had a bond market that waffled a bit and then came on
strong,'' said Austin George, head of equity trading for
mutual-fund operator T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.
   By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up
25-32 point, or $7.80 per $1,000 face amount. The dollar rose to
149.85 yen from 149.03 late Monday.
   Robert L. Kahan, manager of equity trading at Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco, said trading also was quiet until
early afternoon due to a lack of market-affecting news.
   The government reported that orders to factories fell 5.4
percent in January. But the figure was in line with analysts'
estimates and had little market impact, traders said.
   The buying driven by computer programs was launched when stock
index futures jumped in price relative to the underlying stocks.
   ``It just kind of touched the level (to activate the programs) a
couple of times,'' George said.
   Among blue-chip issues on the NYSE, General Electric was up | to
62&rsqb;, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was up } to 40| and Philip
Morris was up 1&rsqb; to 38\.
   American Express, the most-active NYSE issue, was down \ to 27\,
on top of losing 1~ Monday. Over the weekend, the company announced
plans to reacquire the publicly held shares of its troubled
Shearson Lehman Hutton brokerage through an exchange of stock.
   Texaco, another blue chip, was up ~ to 59~. Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp. upgraded the rating on Texaco senior debt and preferred
stock, citing the oil company's continued improvement in financial
performance.
   Among other most-active issues, Pinacle West jumped 2&lsqb; to 13~.
The utility and bank holding company rejected a sweetened takeover
bid from Pacificorp. Pacificorp fell &rsqb; to 21}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $33.350 billion, or 1.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.02 to 186.17.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.05 to 389.54, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 4.19 to 337.93.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.18 to 432.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 2.17 to 358.81.

   Regulating a securities firm like Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. without financial data on its parent company
is like being a doctor who can only examine part of the body, the
head of the Securities and Exchange Commission told a Senate panel
on Tuesday.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden used a budget hearing before the
commerce subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee as an
opportunity to lobby for additional authority.
   Questioned about the recent collapse of Drexel, Breeden said one
difficulty for the SEC was lack of data about the parent holding
company, which filed for bankruptcy code protection last month.
   The SEC regulates broker-dealers but not their parent companies,
which don't have to disclose their financial status.
   Legislation pending in both the House and Senate would give the
SEC access to such financial data.
   Breeden likened the limitations on such information to being a
physician ``who can only look at the right arm from the elbow to
the wrist. It's very unrealistic.''
   The Bush administration is seeking $192.4 million for the SEC in
1991, a 14 percent increase over the 1990 appropriation of $168.7
million.
   Breeden noted that Congress should be mindful that SEC revenue
production through filing fees ``have significantly exceeded its
appropriations.''
   He pointed out that in 1989, while receiving only $142.6 million
in appropriations, the SEC generated $213.8 million in fees.
   But Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the
subcommittee, asked why the administration was seeking to increase
SEC fees an estimated $80 million in 1991.
   ``Why are you increasing the fees when you got more than enough
to run the business? Did you recommend any (increases)?'' he asked.
   ``This proposal is not a commission proposal,'' said Breeden.
   ``Ahh, there we go,'' said Hollings, prompting laughter in the
cramped hearing room in the Capitol building.
   Hollings hinted that the fee increase might be an administration
move to cut the deficit but Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., noted that
the fee increase, approved by Congress last year, was only
temporary and the latest administration request would make it
permanent.

   A federal judge on Tuesday refused to bar a
former Philips Industries executive accused of insider trading from
selling more stock in the company, but froze about $1 million of
his assets.
   U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice approved a request by the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the temporary freeze on
Robert H. Brethen's assets being held in an escrow account. The SEC
sought the freeze to assure payment of any future damages.
   The SEC has asked the judge for a preliminary injunction to keep
Brethen, a former Philips vice chairman, from trading his Philips
stock. Rice refused to grant a temporary restraining order pending
a hearing.
   An SEC civil lawsuit against Brethen last week alleged he used
non-public information about unfavorable company news to avoid
$570,000 in losses in the stock market in January when he sold
109,733 shares for more than $2 million on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The SEC claimed Brethen would continue to violate securities
laws unless he is restrained from further securities trading.
   The judge had postponed a ruling on the temporary restraining
order from last week after the SEC alleged Brethen lied to the
commission and tried to cover up his access to inside information.
   The case is considered unusual because the government said three
attorneys and a stockbroker for Brethen have testified that they
advised him not to sell the stock because it may violate securities
laws.
   ``Brethen's violations are continuing,'' Jeffrey Zuckerman,
assistant regional administrator for the SEC, said in a letter to
the judge. ``Brethen was engaging in an ongoing violation in
January ... when he was caught in the breach by the commission.''
   ``Rather than cooperate with the commission, however, Brethen
compounded his violations by engaging in an attempt to cover up,''
the letter said.
   SEC attorney James Tyne said in court last week that Brethen may
be financially strapped because of a new business venture, Celstar
Group Inc., and might lose the $1 million he had earlier agreed to
place in escrow after the SEC launched an investigation.
   David Cupps, Brethen's attorney, said his client has cooperated
fully with the SEC, including giving voluntary testimony, and
should have his money returned ``to conduct his business.''
   Brethen, 63, retired at the end of last year from Philips, a
manufacturer or components for construction and recreational
vehicles. Previously he had been president and chief executive of
the compny.
   Cupps said Brethen no longer has access to inside information
and sold some of the stock only after an attorney assured him doing
so would be proper.
   But Tyne said there was a ``very strong likelihood'' of repeated
violations because Brethen still owns 100,000 shares of Philis
stock, misled the SEC and ignored the advice of at least three
lawyers not to sell the shares.
   The SEC alleged Brethen sold the stock while possessing
non-public information that Philips' earnings would be dramatically
lower than expected for the final quarter of 1989, which would have
an adverse impact on a proposed buyout of Philips.

   Department officials cautioned that these figures may not be

   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
took their biggest plunge in more than 15 years in January, the
government said Tuesday. Analysts described the 5.4 percent drop as
temporary and not widespread but said it still indicated an anemic
manufacturing economy.
   The Commerce Department said orders for durable and non-durable
goods fell to a seasonally adjusted $227.7 billion, the steepest
drop since they sank 7 percent in December 1974.
   A sharp 10.5 percent January decrease in durable goods orders,
to $117.8 billion, led the plunge.
   A 28.8 percent drop in transportation orders accounted for 85
percent of the durable decline, said economist Michael P. Niemira
of Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
   ``Obviously, if 85 percent of it is in transportation, that
doesn't say that it is widespread,'' Niemira said.
   Automakers laid off 90,000 workers in January while they
attempted to shave bloated inventories, but most workers have since
returned and, Niemira said, motor vehicle production increased 30
percent in February.
   ``That will feed directly into this report next month,'' he said.
   Also down in January were orders for aircraft, which had shown
huge increases the previous two months, and for defense goods. Both
sectors are volatile and Niemira said both the Boeing Co. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. already have reported increased aircraft
orders during February.
   ``Aside from those three sectors, basically industry is showing
a modest pace of growth,'' explained economist Priscilla Trumbull
of DRI@McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. ``Fairly small, but at least
it's growing.''
   Economic weakness has been concentrated in the manufacturing and
housing sectors since the Federal Reserve began its high-interest
policies to curb inflation. Both sectors are often sensitive to
interest rates since their products often are financed by loans.
   The Commerce Department reported the 10.5 percent decline in
durable goods orders last week, saying it was the biggest drop in
32 years of recordkeeping and surpassed the previous record of 9.2
percent set in February 1982 during the last recession.
   It followed a 1.2 percent gain in December, which was revised
down from 1.9 percent reported last month.
   Orders for non-durable goods rose 0.8 percent to $109.9 billion
in January after falling 0.5 percent in December. The December drop
was revised downward from a 0.3 percent gain reported last month.
   Defense orders fell 28.8 percent to $6.95 billion in January
after dropping 13.3 percent a month earlier. Excluding defense,
factory orders were off 4.4 percent.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods, a
barometer of business investment plans, fell 14.2 percent in
January to $38.1 billion, reversing a 14.1 percent gain in December.
   Shipments of manufactured goods dropped 1.9 percent in January
to $226.6 billion. Inventories rose 0.7 percent to $373.9 billion,
nearly offsetting a 0.5 percent decrease in December.
   If inventories increase without a corresponding gain in new
orders, it could signal production cutbacks in the future as
factories attempt to get rid of stored goods.
   Among the durable goods orders, electrical machinery was down
15.5 percent to $19.2 billion, most of which was in communications
equipment.
   Non-electrical machinery, including computers and a wide variety
of industrial equipment, rose 2.4 percent to $22.3 billion. Primary
metals were up 1.2 percent to $11.1 billion.

   Misubishi Corp. said Tuesday it was negotiating
with West Germany's Daimler-Benz Group to form a series of joint
ventures between the industrial giants in aerospace, electronics
and other fields.
   If completed, an agreement would unite Japan and West Germany's
two largest business groups, giving Mitsubishi a toehold in a
united European Economic Comunity in 1992 and Daimler-Benz access
to Japanese technology.
   Top executives from Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz held talks on
expanding their cooperation last weekend in Singapore, Mitsubishi
said in a statement Tuesday.
   Mitsubishi said the areas explored included ``high-growth
industries'' such as aerospace, electronics and the service sector
``that would benefit from development on a global scale and make
effective use of the skills of both groups.''
   Japanese newspapers reported Wednesday that the companies had
signed an agreement to pursue cooperation in many areas, including
mounting a challenge on U.S. dominance of aerospace technology.
   ``There was a far-reaching exchange of ideas about ways to
expand the relationship beyond the automotive sector, where
Mercedes Benz and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. have enjoyed close
ties,'' Mitsubishi said.
   The statement said senior managers from Mitsubishi and
Daimler-Benz ``expressed pleasure at having gained greater
familiarity with each other and agreed to hold further meetings in
due course.''
   Mitsubishi spokesman Kyosuke Mori said the executives had agreed
to meet once a year, and he expected the next meeting would occur
in 1991.
   The companies both make motor vehicles and electronics equipment
and are active in the aviation and space fields.
   Mori said the four Mitsubishi companies and the four
Daimler-Benz companies whose executives attended the meeting were
roughly comparable.
   They were Mitsubishi Motors and Mercedes-Benz in the automotive
sector; Mitsubishi Electric and AEG in electrical systems and
components; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Deutsche Aerospace in
aircraft and aerospace equipment; and Mitsubishi Corp. and
Daimler-Benz Inter Services in trading and investment services.
   Mori said the weekend meeting evolved from a meeting last
November in Europe between Mitsubishi Corp. President Shinroku
Morohashi and Daimler Benz Chairman Edzard Reuter. Morohashi was in
Europe to mark the offering of Mitsubishi shares on the London and
Paris stock exchanges, Mori said.
   Morohashi and Reuter led their companies' executives at the
Singapore meeting, the spokesman said.
   Mitsubishi Corp. is the core company of the giant Mitsubishi
Group of related firms and is Japan's largest trading company, with
transactions in the last fiscal year of $118 billion.
   Mitsubishi's 29 companies had total sales of about $82 billion
in 1988, while Daimler-Benz had sales of $37.3 billion.
