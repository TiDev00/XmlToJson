   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens, convicted last year
in a sex scandal involving a 16-year-old girl, will file petitions
as a GOP candidate but hasn't decided whether to seek re-election,
a spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``He has decided to file petitions because it leaves his options
open,'' said William Jarrell, Lukens' Washington press secretary.
The deadline for filing is Feb. 22.
   The Republican congressman was convicted last May on a
misdemeanor charge of contributing to the unruliness of a minor
after the Columbus girl alleged she had sex with him. Lukens has
appealed the conviction.
   Jarrell said Lukens would await a ruling on his appeal before
making a decision whether to run.

   The Navy has grounded nearly all of
its Bell TH-57 Jet Ranger training helicopters because of cracks in
landing-skid supports, officials said Wednesday.
   All 140 of the Navy's orange-and-white TH-57s are based at this
air station in the Florida Panhandle, the only installation where
the service trains new helicopter pilots.
   Only 25 TH-57s were flying as of Wednesday, said Lt. Tara
LaCavera, public affairs officer for Training Air Wing 5.
   ``No accidents have happened because of it,'' she said.
   Cracks were found in 123 of the aircraft, reducing flight
operations by 80 percent as of Monday, but repairs are being made,
said Petty Officer 1st Class Jon Gagne. He said the reduction is
expected to be down to only 10 percent by March 15.
   ``What caused it has not yet been determined,'' Gagne said.
   Aviation maintenance personnel from Bell and the Naval Aviation
Depot at the Pensacola Naval Air Station about 30 miles southwest
of here are investigating, he said.
   LaCavera said the defective parts are being replaced but it will
be mid-March before sufficient quantities will be available to
repair all of the helicopters. She said costs of the repair work
haven't yet been determined.
   The first crack was discovered during a routine maintenance
inspection Jan. 24 and all 135 TH-57s on the base were checked last
week, Gagne said. Five helicopters are away from Whiting for other
maintenance.
   In an effort to make up lost training time, the Navy will begin
conducting training flights on Saturdays and Sundays beginning Feb.
17 and continue operations seven days a week for an indefinite
period, LaCavera said.

<HEAD>Cranston Popularity Drops To New Low</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Despite an aggressive effort to bolster his
image, Sen. Alan Cranston's popularity has sunk to a new low among
California voters skeptical of his explanation of the Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan scandal, a new survey says.
   The results of the California Poll come after Cranston tried to
restore his reputation by attacking one of his main accusers in the
savings and loan debacle, former thrift regulator Edwin Gray.
   ``People aren't buying it,'' said Mervin Field, director of the
statewide poll. ``They've already made their judgment.''
   Californians said by 69 to 20 percent that they would not be
inclined to vote for Cranston were he to seek a record fifth term
in 1992. Cranston has said he will seek re-election.
   By 56 percent to 31 percent, Democrats in the poll said they
were not inclined to vote again for Cranston.
   The survey was conducted by telephone Feb. 2 to 10 among a
statewide cross-section of 754 registered voters. The sampling has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
   Cranston and four other U.S. senators are being investigated by
the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with federal regulators
on behalf of Lincoln after accepting more than $41.3 million in
contributions from Charles Keating Jr. , Lincoln's chairman.
   Cranston has said repeatedly that he did not impede regulators
and only asked them to make a decision whether to close Lincoln or
allow it to remain in business.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year after the Soviet Union
withdrew its soldiers from the war against U.S.-backed Moslem
guerrillas, President Najib's government points proudly to its
survival.
   But it is still a government under siege, militarily,
politically and economically.
   Najib, former chief of the dreaded KHAD secret police, has
confounded his most strident critics, notably those in the United
States, who predicted a bloodbath and a guerrilla victory within
months, if not weeks, of the Red Army's departure. But at best,
Najib and his Soviet-style People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan
are survivors, not victors.
   The capital today is best viewed from afar early in the morning,
when it glistens under a dusting of snow.
   Up close, it's a city of war-weariness and poverty where men,
women and children slog through slush and mud, many of them
sockless in cracked, second-hand shoes and plastic sandals.
   It's a city where a 13-year-old schoolboy like Ismail can earn
4,000 afghanis a month pulling a cart loaded with bags of flour
weighing three times as much as he does. His father is paid 3,000
afghanis a month as an office worker at the Culture Ministry.
   At the official exchange rate, Ismail's earnings are worth $72,
while his father's are worth $55. But at the more realistic black
market rate, Ismail makes the equivalent of $8 while his father
earns $6.
   Ismail competes with other young boys and old men for full-time
work during the annual November-February school vacation. He boasts
_ dubiously _ that because of his earnings, his family of nine can
afford a little meat almost every day.
   The afghani has become an almost meaningless currency. Its
dollar value has been cut in half in the past year, while fixed
wages have not changed. It's more appropriate to view earnings in
the context of meat, which costs between 800 and 1,000 afghanis per
2.2 pounds.
   Ismail's wages are worth about 11 pounds of mutton, his
fathers's 8.25 pounds _ hardly enough to feed a family of nine for
a month, let alone buy rice, bread and cooking fuel.
   Kabul salaries are especially sobering for the foreign visitor
who plunks down 3,000 afghanis to purchase a fistfull of notebooks
and a dozen batteries.
   Militarily, the Afghan forces have expanded their control, both
around Kabul and the countryside. But guerrilla rockets still hit
Kabul every day, although with less accuracy and fewer verified
deaths than a year ago.
   The government claims to have expanded its ``security belt''
around the city and pushed back the guerrillas since the Soviets
completed their withdrawal Feb. 15, 1989.
   ``Our defensive line extends between 65 kilometers (40 miles)
and 80 kilomters (50 miles) from the center of Kabul,'' Brig. Gen.
Gulbahar Salim told reporters.
   While visits to the front indicated those figures are
exaggerated, the government has indeed expanded its control.
   Not only did it defeat the guerrillas when they tried to capture
the eastern city of Jalalabad last year, it has re-opened key
highways leading east and south of Kabul toward the guerrilla
strongholds.
   Proof of this comes not only from the statements of the
government and foreign diplomats but _ perhaps more convincingly _
from the lush displays of oranges, tangerines and pomegranates
throughout Kabul.
   At this time of year, Afghanistan produces such fruit only in
the warmer climates near the Pakistani border, guerrilla turf since
the civil war started in 1978 between the Soviet-backed government
and the mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   Politically, Najib has spent the year attempting to convince the
world he is ready to share power. Through speeches and the
dispatching of envoys to both Eastern and Western Europe,
invitations have been extended to Afghan exiles,
   There have been no public takers.
   In Kabul, there is a sense of change in the People's Democratic
Party, which seized power nearly 12 years ago and initially but
unsuccessfully tried to impose Marxism on a tribalistic and
capitalistic society.
   Sources in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Najib
wants to rename the party to give it a less socialist-sounding
name. The party has long been denounced by the guerrillas as a
collection of ``godless Communists.''
   Such efforts by Najib appeared to have been hurt this week by a
change of leadership in the National Front, a purportedly
multiparty umbrella group set up about four years ago.
   The National Front, which the mujahedeen consider nothing but a
pseudonym for Najib's party and its followers, on Manday accepted
the resignation of its chairman, Abdul Rahim Hatif.
   Hatif, a non-party man, is Afghanistan's vice president and
technically the No. 2 man in government after Najib.
   The official explanation for his resignation was that Hatif, a
businessman in his late 60s, needed more time for his vice
presidential duties.
   More telling was the fact his successor is Farid Ahmad Mozdak, a
member of the Politburo and secretary of the central committee of
Najib's own party, still the only real player in Kabul politics.

<HEAD>Reagan-Bush Campaign Official, Partners, to Repay HUD $720,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUNSWICK, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The general counsel of Ronald Reagan's
presidential campaign and his partners in a Georgia housing
development are to pay back nearly $720,000 in misspent federal
money under an agreement reached Wednesday.
   Under the plan worked out between the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban development, the Brunswick City Commission and developers
of Cypress Mill Plantation, the developers will repay the money,
plus interest, over 20 years.
   The developers, partners in Brunswick Housing Development Group
Ltd., are Edward L. Weidenfeld, the Washington lawyer who served as
general counsel to the Reagan-Bush campaign; Michael E. Yates of
Savannah; and Stephen M. Botnick of Akron, Ohio.
   None of the three could be located for comment Wednesday.
   The developers received about $3.1 million in federal housing
money for the $6 million low-income project, a 152-unit complex
completed in 1987. HUD officials found financial discrepancies last
year and ordered an audit.
   Conducted by the agency's regional inspector general, the audit
said $757,667 of the federal financing allocated for the Cypress
Mill project was misused. The money was spent on expenses
ineligible under federal guidelines, including some development
costs related to Plantation Oaks, a sister project in Savannah, HUD
officials said.
   The audit followed an April report by HUD Inspector General John
A. Adams that alleged mismanagement within the agency and
influence-peddling by prominent Republicans to win housing
contracts.
   HUD officials said, however, the Brunswick audit was unrelated
to the influence-peddling scandal.
   The developers, the agency said, had failed to put enough of
their own money, a required ``equity injection,'' into the project,
instead improperly charging certain expenses against the grant.
   Subsequent review of the expense figures resulted in the final
HUD order for repayment of $718,605. With interest and a $54,000
fee, the total due HUD came to $920,088, according to HUD documents.

   The United States and the Soviet Union
will send home thousands of their troops stationed in Central
Europe under a new deal struck by the two sides.
   But the Kremlin may have a hard time finding a welcome mat in
the increasingly independent East bloc for the 195,000 soldiers
allowed under the agreement worked out by foreign ministers this
week in Canada.
   Even so, the European continent will still be crowded with
hundreds of thousands of soldiers, ranging from those who are part
of alliance forces to those in their own national armies.
   ``It's a very substantial reduction. (But) it's still a lot of
troops around by historical standards,'' said John Cross, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
   ``It will still be fairly densely populated with military,'' he
said.
   Under the agreement, the Soviet Union and the United States will
slash their troops stationed outside national territory to equal
ceilings of 195,000 in Central Europe. The region covers West
Germany, East Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Denmark.
   In a surprising concession, the Kremlin agreed to let Washington
maintain an additional 30,000 soldiers outside that zone, in
Britain and southern Europe. The United States wants the extra men
to reassure its allies and make up for the vast distance between
the United States and Europe.
   ``The presence of U.S. troops in Europe ... is at the express
wish of the allies,'' said Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``It is necessary due to the geographical distance from the
continental United States, and as a concrete expression of the
American commitment to Europe,'' he said in a statement welcoming
the accord.
   To meet the new levels, the Soviet Union will have to pare
370,000 soldiers from its estimated total of 565,000.
   The United States will have to trim 60,000 in Central Europe and
20,000 outside that region from a total of 305,000 troops in all of
Europe.
   Terms of the deal require that the units be disbanded.
   The agreement will be part of a final accord to be wrapped up by
year's end on reducing tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear arms
in Europe. The talks are between the 16 NATO nations and the seven
of the Warsaw Pact.
   In accepting the troop cuts, the Soviet Union recognized the
changing situation in Eastern Europe, where a wave of political
reform has ousted long-faithful Communist regimes.
   The Kremlin opened talks with new governments in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia after they demanded quick pullouts of troops sent
decades ago to keep them in line. Poland could also join the drive.
   ``The Soviets could well find themselves in due course in some
difficulty in maintaining 195,000 troops (in Eastern Europe),''
said Cross.
   Richard Fieldhouse, a military analyst for the Natural Resources
Defense Council in Washington, said, ``The Soviets are going to
make troop reductions with or without (an arms treaty).''
   The result, he said, might be ``very few Soviet troops in
Eastern Europe.''
   Some 10,000 Soviet soldiers already have left Hungary and
Czechoslovakia under a withdrawal plan announced in December 1988
by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   About 52,000 Red Army soldiers are still in Hungary, and 70,000
in Czechoslovakia. Poland has an estimated 40,000, and more than
380,000 are assigned to East Germany.
   Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, an adviser to Gorbachev, said in an
interview this week that the Kremlin had not received a formal
request from Poland to discuss troop withdrawals.
   ``Once we have ... such an initiative on the part of Poland,
this is not going to be a problem,'' he said. ``We are going to
engage in the talks and have our forces removed from there.''
   Analysts say Poland may see a contingent of Soviet forces as
protection, fearing possible designs on its territory by a
reunified Germany.
   Reductions of the Red Army in East Germany will depend on
security arrangements worked out for the reunification of the two
German states. But it would be unlikely that a huge number would be
allowed under any solution that joined the eastern sector to its
powerful western neighbor.
   West Germany has about 240,000 American soldiers on its soil.
Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands have sent more than
100,000 there.
   Even under the troops accord, there will still be a substantial
American presence in West Germany. Moreover, the agreement does not
affect the forces of other NATO allies.
   ``Germany is not going to be demilitarized of foreign forces,''
said Fieldhouse.

<HEAD>Passion Play Emphasizes Jewishness of Jesus, But Retains `Blood
Curse'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 3-century-old Oberammergau Passion Play is
eliminating some anti-Semitic stereotypes, but an ancient ``blood
curse'' still divides American Jewish leaders and villagers in the
small town in the Bavarian Alps.
   The script for the 1990 production _ expected to draw more than
200,000 American visitors _ emphasizes the Jewishness of Jesus,
drops horns from the heads of Jewish high priests and presents
Judas as confused rather than a cold mercenary figure.
   ``We have tried to ... show the Jewish tradition in a positive
light,'' said Otto Huber, one of the directors, in an interview
from his home in Oberammergau.
   But American Jewish leaders who have been meeting with village
officials are concerned the anticipated half-million spectators for
the play will still hear the passage from Matthew 27:25 that has
plagued Jews for 19 centuries: ``His blood be on us and our
children.''
   ``For 1990, we still have the same basic text with the blood
curse,'' said Rabbi James Rudin, national interreligious affairs
director for the American Jewish Committee.
   The Passion Play dates from 1663, when bubonic plague ravaged
the mountain valley where Oberammergau sits. When the Roman
Catholic villagers vowed to stage a passsion play every 10 years if
the plague abated, the epidemic vanished in what was considered a
miracle, according to historical accounts.
   The play, to be performed this year from May 21 to Sept. 28, was
last performed in 1984, when a special jubilee production attracted
470,000 spectators. Americans accounted for about 45 percent of the
visitors to the daylong production.
   Since then, leaders from the American Jewish Committee and the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith have sought to change
aspects of the play they believed maligned Jews and blamed them for
the murder of Christ.
   Among the changes for 1990:
   _ Jesus' identity as a Jew is emphasized, including having him
and his followers wear traditional prayer shawls. ``We have tried
to show Jesus really as a Jew coming out from Jewish tradition and
Jewish faith,'' Huber said.
   _ Jesus has a larger popular following among Jews, and there is
no longer a separation of Jesus and his followers and the rest of
the Jewish community in light and dark clothing. ``You had the good
guys and the bad guys in the 1984 text,'' Rudin said.
   _ There is no longer any connection between the temple merchants
and Jesus' persecutors. Rudin said that connection was ``one of the
worst stereotypes of the play,'' playing on anti-Semitic images
such as ``Shylock.''
   _ The Jewish high priests who presided at the trial that led to
the condemnation of Jesus will no longer have horns, an image
carried over from the Middle Ages.
   _ Pontius Pilate, who before 1984 was portrayed a noble Roman
and in 1984 was shown as ambivalent in sentencing Jesus to death,
is presented in the 1990 text as an unsympathetic, brutal character.
   _ Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, is portrayed
as a confused character who lost faith in Jesus, rather than as a
man motivated only by the 30 pieces of silver he received for
giving Jesus up.
   Rudin said Jewish leaders are sensitive to the efforts made by
the German village, but while there were many positive
developments, ``The retention of the `blood curse' is very
problematic.''
   The idea that Jewish people have collective guilt for the death
of Jesus has been devastating in its impact on Jews throughout the
centuries. Rudin said a new script should be written in light of
the Holocaust and advances in Jewish-Christian relations.
   Rudin said American Jewish groups are not urging a boycott of
the play, but plan to make available background materials on the
play and hold briefings for people planning to visit Oberammergau.
   Huber said the changes show Oberammergau is ``very conscious
about all the questions of anti-Semitism.''
   He noted the passage from Matthew was barely retained by an 11-9
vote of the text committee, and with certain provisions: that a
five-page explanation be included in scripts that tourists purchase
to follow the German-language play. The explanation says the
passage does not apply to one race and outlines the history of
anti-Semitism surrounding it.
   ``With all the changes, I think that anti-Semitism is not the
problem of the play in 1990,'' Huber said.

``Don Pasquale.''
   She was given a rapturous reception Monday night after her first
performance of the role in the comic work by Gaetano Donizetti.
   The Times of London called it an ``astute performance, with the
renowned Battle coloratura on full display with every note hit dead
center.''
   Miss Battle first appeared in Covent Garden in 1984 in Richard
Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos,'' and was the first American to win
the Laurence Olivier Award, an honor for best performance of a new

   Miss Battle, wonderfully lively in the footlights, keeps to

modern marriages.
   ``Sadly, for many of these marriages, reality fails to live up
to expectations. When that happens most couples discover and draw
on new reserves of love and strength,'' Diana said Wednesday. ``But
for many, their own resources are not enough.''
   The princess, patron of the marriage guidance organization

   The winners were Rico and Heather Gopaul, both 30, and children
Rico Jr., 7, Ryan, 6, Ricky, 3, and Rosita, 2. The mother and
father are nurses who care for mentally handicapped people.
   ``The award celebrates the victory of very simple values over
the very complex difficulties confronted by so many modern
marriages,'' said Diana, who married Prince Charles in 1981. The
couple has two sons.

   Transsexual Terri Pohrman is running
for mayor of this conservative town and making inroads among senior
citizens with the slogan, ``The Change Will Do You Good.''
   The former Las Vegas show girl was a regular entertainer at the
California Veterans' Home before she entered the race, but now the
home is a campaign stop _ more than 700 of the 1,800 registered
voters in this wine-country town live there.
   She visited the home last weekend wearing roller skates and a
tight body stocking with huge red cardboard hearts over her front
and back. Later, she donned a red sequined cocktail dress with a
plunging neckline.
   ``All the guys got a big kick out of her,'' said Gene Sockness,
61. ``She's really welcome up here and shows us a good time. So
what the heck, live and let live.''
   The big-shouldered blonde with spiky hair faces two opponents in
the April 10 election. Her ambitions have panicked some residents
of this town of 3,200 people, about 40 miles north of San Francisco.
   ``These people are scared,'' she said. ``They think I'll open a
bunch of massage parlors and adult bookstores.''
   Pohrman was a teen-age female impersonator before having a sex

officials said.
   The British rock star known for his outlandish outfits and
musical longevity will perform May 18-19 at the casino's 5,200-seat
Mark Grossinger Etess Arena.
   ``I want the biggest and the best to play at the Trump Taj
Mahal, and when Elton John takes the stage, the future of
entertainment in Atlantic City will never be the same,'' Trump said
in a statement Wednesday.

   People are clamoring for eight ``power''
puppies from a schnauzer owned by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and
fathered by a schnauzer belonging to Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., and
Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole.
   Thurmond's wife, Nancy, said the Doles will get the pick of the
black-and-brown pups and the others likely will go to people in
Thurmond's hometown of Aiken.
   ``A lot of people want them, and we are going to give them
away,'' said Mrs. Thurmond.
   The mother, Chelsea Marie, is a miniature schnauzer, and the
father is Leader, a schnauzer with suspect lineage. Leader was
rescued from a shelter when Dole was the majority leader.
   ``The Doles are known as the Washington power couple, so we
called Leader the power dog,'' Mrs. Thurmond said.
   Leader spent three weeks at the Thurmond home last fall.

   Despite an agreement on European troop
ceilings, the United States and the Soviet Union are still arguing
over combat aircraft and anti-cheating procedures for a 23-nation
treaty to reduce forces on the continent, Bush administration
officials say.
   The agreement, reached by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at an ``Open
Skies'' conference in Ottawa, Canada, on Tuesday, prompted U.S.
allies to begin preparing for a 35-nation summit meeting later this
year.
   The treaty _ now in negotiations in Vienna between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact _ would be signed
at the session which would be attended by the United States,
Canada, the Soviet Union, 31 European nations and the Vatican.
   Baker is scheduled to meet next with Shevardnadze sometime in
the first two weeks of April in Washington, a U.S. official said.
The talks in Moscow last week and the April meeting are in
preparation for Bush's summit meeting with Gorbachev in Washington
in June.
   The agreement on manpower provides a ceiling of 195,000 American
and Soviet troops in Central Europe and an additional 30,000 U.S.
soldiers in such countries as Britain, Italy and Spain.
   For treaty purposes, Central Europe is defined as West Germany,
Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands for stationing
American soldiers and East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Hungary for Soviet troops.
   Two Bush administration officials, at a background briefing for
reporters at the State Department on Wednesday, cautioned against
assuming the treaty is about to be wrapped up following the
agreement on troop ceilings and the start of summit preparations.
   For one thing, the United States and the Soviet Union are at
odds over combat aircraft. Baker said in a speech Monday in Ottawa
that Moscow's position would require NATO to add 2,000 planes to
reach an equal level.
   ``This is one of the major outstanding issues for everybody who
wants to get this treaty done,'' one of the U.S. officials said.
   He described the Soviet response to the U.S. position on
distinguishing combat aircraft from defensive interceptors, which
would not be subject to limits, as ``patently unreasonable.''
   The official said he could not predict the outcome of the
dispute. ``The positions are very difficult, and there is
substantial distance between them,'' he said.
   Among other difficult and unresolved issues, he said, is
verification _ or what measures to use to make certain the cutbacks
ordered by the treaty are implemented.
   ``As a matter of treaty drafting, verification is a tremendously
time-consuming and difficult task,'' he said. ``So there is a lot
of work to be done.''
   Under the treaty, ceilings would be set for troops, tanks,
artillery, armored personnel carries and helicopters from the
Atlantic across the vast expanse of Europe to the Ural Mountains in
the Soviet Union.
   Monitoring compliance ``is immensely more complex'' than dealing
with the U.S. and Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles that
were banned in a treaty in 1988, the official said.
   Bush on Tuesday called Soviet acceptance of his troop reduction
proposal as ``an important breakthrough'' that removes a major
obstacle to the treaty.
   ``Now, let's close the deal. That's what I want to do. Conclude
this CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe) agreement and get it done
and signed,'' he said.
   But Bush said, ``there's still some technical problems.''

<HEAD>Reports Circulate That Vietnam Involved Again in Cambodia Conflict</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnamese forces may be operating again in
Cambodia just five months after Hanoi reported all of its troops
had been withdrawn for good, according to reports reaching top U.S.
officials.
   The officials said Wednesday the reports indicate renewed
Vietnamese involvement in the conflict was the result of
battlefield setbacks suffered by the Hanoi-backed government in
Cambodia.
   Representatives of the United States and the four other
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council compared
notes on the issue on Monday and Tuesday in New York where they
discussed ways to advance the Cambodian peace process.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed a friendly
government after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime, which has been
held responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians
during almost four years in power.
   Under heavy international pressure, Vietnam gradually scaled
back its troop deployment and Hanoi officials announced in
September that the last of its troops had been withdrawn.
   The Vietnamese invasion touched off the formation of three
Cambodian insurgencies aimed at driving Hanoi's forces from
Vietnam. The United States and a number of other interested parties
have been attempting to end the conflict through a process ending
in free and fair elections.
   U.S. officials who briefed reporters Wednesday said the Chinese
delegate at the New York meeting and two others commented on the
purported Vietnamese military role in Cambodia.
   The officials, asking not to be identified, indicated they
considered the reports concerning the Vietnamese presence to be
accurate. One participant at the New York meeting, according to the
officials, said about 1,000 Vietnamese troops may be operating in
the area of Angkor, site of temples and other buildings of historic
significance.
   It was not clear to the officials whether the Vietnamese
soldiers had returned to Cambodia or whether they had never left,
if indeed the reports of their presence there are accurate.
   According to the officials, the army of the pro-Vietnamese
government of Cambodia has suffered setbacks in the most recent
fighting against resistance forces of the Khmer Rouge and of former
Cambodian Premier Son Sann. The fighting has tapered off recently
but could intensify before the end of the dry season this spring,
the sources said.
   In a bid to end the fighting, the permanent members of the
Security Council have been discussing proposals in which the United
Nations would provide a peacekeeping force once a cease-fire is
agreed to and to play an administrative role in the process leading
to free elections.
   The Bush administration has said prevention of a Khmer Rouge
return to power is a major policy objective. Nonetheless, the two
resistance groups which the United States supports have formed a
tactical alliance with the Khmer Rouge, prompting some critics to
warn that U.S. policy could be paving the way for a Khmer Rouge
comeback.
   The Khmer Rouge's main backer is China, which seeks to reduce
Vietnamese influence in Southeast Asia.

<HEAD>A Single Germany: No Fear of Jackboots, But Worries Nonetheless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Historians say the world need not fear that
German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some
still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _ a
step away from the integration of Europe.
   For the most part, the historians say an East Germany collapsing
into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united
German state.
   ``The West Germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic
fervor, but a perceived need to deal with a crisis,'' said Henry
Ashby Turner of Yale, author of ``The Two Germanies Since 1945.''
   ``There is no such a thing as indelible national character,''
Turner said. ``I don't think there is any chance that the young men
of Germany are going to slip out of their Adidas running shoes and
pull on jackboots and start running around saying, `Heil!''
   He was one of several experts in German history discussing the
implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the
four World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France and
the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they
divided 45 years ago.
   University of Chicago historian Michael Geyer, a native of
Germany, said he feared the creation of a ``strong, sovereign
nation in the center of Europe'' could reverse a more important
development _ the 40-year drive toward an integrated Europe in
which industries, banks, trade unions and even government
ministries have been collaborating across borders.
   ``The East German state is collapsing,'' said Geyer. ``So
something has to happen very dramatically. But they have a choice _
the Europeans and Germans and Americans. Do they want to opt for
the European card or for the German card? I think they are opting
for the German card.''
   ``I hear these days very little about what Gorbachev called `the
house of Europe,''' he said.
   The result of a dominant ``uncomfortably strong'' German state,
Geyer added, could be a setback to the diminishment of national
borders. It could also mean, he said, that American troops might
have to stay in Europe as a counterweight to Germany.
   ``If I had my druthers reunifications would have happened after
1992, after the integration of the West German economy into the
economy of Western Europe,'' said Charles J. Herber of George
Washington University, expressing similar concern.
   ``Then there would have been fewer chances for German
adventurers,'' he said.
   West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings,
said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented
reunification within the context of European integration. They
wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united Germany again dominating
Europe.
   ``Even if the history did not exist, there would be fears of
that kind,'' he said. ``We're dealing not just with rational
calculation but a whole host of emotional memories.''
   For all that, Breitman said, ``One Germany is not only
inevitable, but given the successful record of West Germany over
the last 40 years, my feeling is it is better than having a regime
in chaos.''
   ``The only alternative to reunification,'' added Turner, is an
East Germany in ruins, ``a basket case, a Bangladesh of Europe.''
   He said Germans have ``no significant interest in territorial
revisions. Those misgivings are misplaced.''
   Gerhard Weinberg of the University of North Carolina, considered
a leading historian of the Nazi era, cautioned that reunification,
if mishandled, could prove explosive.
   While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic
distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he
said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia,
he said.
   ``I don't think the Germans are heading for Moscow again, but we
have to give people _ and the Germans have to give people _ time to
think this through and get used to it. ... Mishandled,
reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into
starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it
would end.''
   Gordon Craig, emeritus professor at Stanford, said the division
of Germany has been the basis of a peace settlement ``which worked
pretty well'' but was ``abnormal and sooner or later had to be
corrected.''
   German reunification, said Craig, gives the world the chance to
build a new international system, one that ``will prevent the use
of international violence.''
   He added, ``We have to be careful that we don't fall back into
the kind of system that existed before the Second World War, a
Europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances,
rivalries, disputed frontiers, driven by what they considered to be
legitimate reasons but pitted against each other _ the sort of
things that gave rise to Hitler in 1933.''

<HEAD>Report Says Limited Contraceptive Choices Force Sterilization,
Abortions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A limited choice of contraceptives in the
United States is leading to increases in abortions and voluntary
sterilizations, according to a report by the National Research
Council.
   Called ``Developing New Contraceptives,'' the study released
Wednesday said Americans have fewer contraceptive choices than in
other countries due to government policies that discourage research
and product development.
   The contraceptive methods now available in the United States,
the report said, ``leave major gaps in the ability of people to
control fertility safely, effectively and in culturally acceptable
ways.''
   Contraceptives are used at some point in the lives of 95 percent
of the 54 million sexually active American women between ages 15
and 44, the report said. It said about 20 percent of this number
have been voluntarily sterilized.
   Among sexually active men with partners at risk of pregnancy,
about 15 percent have had vasectomies.
   ``Limited contraceptive methods force many women and men to make
difficult choices _ to have an abortion or to be sterilized at a
young age _ that could be avoided if additional safe, effective,
acceptable and affordable contraceptives were available,'' the
report says.
   The 193-page report said a greater availability and variety of
safe and effective contraceptives could ``significantly reduce the
frequency of abortion'' in the United States.
   One recent study, the report said, ``indicates that as many as
half of all unintended pregnancies resulting in abortion were the
result of contraceptive failure.''
   About one-third of American women at risk for unwanted
pregnancies use oral contraceptives, with about 3 percent of the
pill-takers becoming pregnant in the first year of use. Three
percent of women use intauterine devices, with 6 percent of these
having an unintended pregnancy in the first year.
   The report said condoms continue to be the contraceptive method
for 17 percent of the partners of women ages 18 to 49. But it said
about 12 percent of these women become pregnant accidentally in the
first year of use.
   For 4 percent to 6 percent of women, the diaphragm is the
contraceptive of choice, even though this method has been shown in
some studies to have failure rates of up to 23 percent, the report
said.
   Contraceptive sponges, which have a failure rate of 18 percent,
are used by 3 percent of the women, and vaginal contraceptives,
such as foams, jellies and creams, are used by 2 percent of women,
with a 21 percent failure rate, it said.
   The report said 44 percent of all American women who use
contraceptives and who are married for 15 years or longer have been
sterilized. Another 24 percent of women are married to men who are
sterilized.
   ``These figures confirm that at some point American women are
ready to stop childbearing,'' the NRC report said. ``These data
also suggest that there are problems with available temporary
(contraceptive) methods.''
   The report said regulations by the Food and Drug Administration
and the risk of product liability lawsuits have caused all but one
of the major U.S. pharmaceutical firms to stop contraceptive
research over the last 20 years. As a result, it said, many
contraceptive implants, devices and injectables that are available
in Europe cannot be sold in this country.
   Many of the techniques now in use in other countries, the report
said, are safer, longer-lasting and more effective than the methods
available to Americans.
   Rigid FDA safety regulations, which evaluate contraceptives by a
different standard than is used in Europe, keep products off the
market here. The report, for instance, noted the FDA blocked
marketing of an injectable contraceptive in this country because
the manufacturer could not prove that it was safe. In the United
Kingdom, however, the logic was turned around and the product was
approved after it could not be demonstrated that it was unsafe.
   Some companies have halted attempts to market contraceptives in
the United States because of stringent product liability laws that
can hold manufacturers liable for damages even if a product meets
federal food and drug standards.
   ``Product liability rules can be changed to remove most of their
undue negative consequences for contraceptive development without
increasing the health risks of contraceptive users,'' the report
said.
   The report was produced jointly by the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine. Both are affiliated with the
National Academy of Sciences, a congressionally chartered private
organization that does research for government agencies.

   A united Germany will have 77 million
people. The two German states now have more than 500,000 soldiers.
Within a few years, the economy of a single Germany could
overshadow that of any other European nation.
   Is the world really ready for one Germany?
   Friends and allies of East and West Germany say ``yes.'' But
many of them _including Britain, France and Poland _ have
apparently not overcome their unification jitters despite German
assurances.
   The French worry that plans for European unity could be
jeopardized and Poland is preoccupied that German conservatives
will demand some of its territory.
   Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, supports eventual
German unity but has recalled the Nazi past by saying Poland and
Britain have had experiences this century that ``we are determined
should not happen again.''
   Europeans are greatly concerned about the economic power a
united Germany would eventually wield, said Dominique Moisi, a
French specialist in international politics.
   ``In the short term there will be a slowdown of German
initiative and power as the West Germans digest East Germany,''
said Moisi, of the Paris-based French Institute for International
Relations. ``But in five to 10 years, economically, we will be
confronted with a very strong country.''
   In land area alone, a united Germany would be a sizeable
presence. Combining East Germany with West Germany would result in
a country of more than 137,600 square miles _ smaller than France
but still a considerable expanse at Europe's heart.
   Merging East Germany with West Germany would add 16 million
people to the West's population of 61 million.
   Unification is apt to cause many discomforts for Germans:
increased joblessness and factory shutdowns in the East, and a new
economic burden for West Germans.
   Experts say West Germany's rescue of East Germany will cost
billions of dollars. But they also say that because of West
Germany's financial muscle _ it has Europe's mightiest economy _
and East Germany's industrial potential, the transition may not
have to last too long.
   West German companies like Volkswagen are already launching
plans to bring their technical know-how to East Germany, and the
signs of giant West German concerns like Siemens could soon be a
common sight in the neighboring land.
   Peter Pietsch, an economist at West Germany's Commerzbank, says
there are excellent possibilities for investment in East Germany
once free-market economic conditions are established.
   Allies and friends of the two Germanys have come to accept the
inevitability of unification, since the only other option would
likely be East Germany's collapse.
   But fears about a united Germany's strength persist, along with
bitter memories of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Poland's prime minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, on Wednesday
demanded his country be included in the newly agreed talks on
German unification, which are to include the two Germanys and the
four victorious World War II allies _ the United States, the Soviet
Union, Britain and France.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France has thrown his support
behind German unification, but also has words of caution.
   According to French newspapers, Mitterrand said ``the Germans
must remember that we are bound together by certain commitments:
security in Europe, the future of the (European Economic) Community
and the balance of power in Europe.''
   Concerns about a united Germany's military stance also persist.
The Soviet Union says a united Germany should be neutral, while the
United States insists it should be a part of NATO.
   West Germany is one of the strongest NATO partners with nearly
400,000 troops. East Germany has about 200,000. Opposition
politicians in West Germany have begun calling for troop cutbacks
as unification nears. But a united Germany's military might is an
open question.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured the world that
German unity will present no foreign threat.
   Kohl says German unity will strengthen all of Europe and will be
a positive factor in the EEC's plans for a barrier-free internal
market by 1992.
   Moisi, the French political scientist, said European unity will
undoubtedly slow as West Germany focuses more on unification.
   Moreover, he believes that East Germans must learn a sense of
European identity, which he contends is shared more by budding East
bloc democracies such as Hungary and Poland.
   ``It is the duty of the West Germans as they swallow East
Germany to give them a sense of European identity. If they do so,
we will have a stronger Europe. If they don't, we will have a
strong Germany within a weak Europe,'' said Moisi.

   President Bush has stressed eradication and strict law
enforcement rather than education and treatment as the major U.S.
weapons in the war against drugs.
   But Bush was ready to show his three summit partners a national
survey showing a steady decline in illegal drug use among U.S. high
school students.
   He was expected to argue that the Bush administration is working
to reduce the demand for drugs, a major concern of Latin American
nations that produce much of the cocaine and other illicit
narcotics that are sold on U.S. streets.
   The president's safety was a major worry in advance of his
scheduled six-hour meeting with the presidents of Colombia, Peru
and Bolivia at a heavily guarded military base outside Cartagena.
There were fears that Colombian drug lords might try to attack
Bush's entourage.
   The drug war has been a major feature of Bush administration
policy, but his efforts have been criticized as inadequate because
the U.S. narcotics trade is still flourishing one year after he
took office.

<HEAD>VIRGILIO BARCO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Before President Virgilio Barco of Colombia began an all-out
assault against cocaine traffickers last August, most of his
countrymen considered him an unlikely commander in the drug war.
   An engineer and an economist by training, the bespectacled
Barco, 68, is a studious man with a halting speaking style often
ridiculed by Colombians.
   Barco was born into a family whose fortune was made in the
petroleum industry.
   A member of the ruling Liberal Party, Barco entered politics 45
years ago as a city councilman in Durania, a small town in eastern
Colombia. He was elected to the national congress in 1949 and over
the decades built a network of political contacts in Bogota, the
capital, as a legislator.
   Barco served as Colombia's development minister in the late
1950s, was named agriculture minister in 1963, and was mayor of
Bogota from 1966 to 1969. In 1986 Barco was elected president for a
four-year term ending this August.
   Polls have shown that while Barco has he has gained
international prestige for his hardline stance against drug
traffickers, many Colombians disapprove of his performance because
of their country's economic difficulties.

   Peruvian President Alan Garcia's trip to Cartagena was one of
the last major acts of his roller-coaster presidency before
Peruvians choose their head of state in elections scheduled for
April 8.
   Garcia vigorously condemned the U.S. invasion of Panama and said
he would boycott the summit if U.S. troops were still in Panama by
then. When Bush said U.S. troops would be reduced to pre-invasion
levels, Garcia agreed to go to Cartagena.
   The charismatic young leader came to power in mid-1985 and was
hugely popular in the first years of his presidency. Strongly
nationalistic, Garcia imposed limits on foreign debt payments,
pumped available dollars into Peru's languid economy and produced
three years of growth.
   But the economy faltered when the money ran out. Hyperinflation
sent prices skyrocketing and Garcia's popularity plunged. Many
blame his populist, free-spending policies for the economic slide,
which resulted in 2,775 percent inflation last year and a 10
percent drop in the gross national product.
   The violent Shining Path guerrilla movement expanded during
Garcia's presidency and has gone on the offensive in many parts of
Peru.

<HEAD>JAIME PAZ ZAMORA</HEAD>

   Bolivian President Jaime Paz Zamora came in third in the May
1989 president elections but took over as Bolivia's 76th president
last August with the support of the country's former military
dictator, Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez.
   Paz Zamora, leader of the social democratic movement of the
revolutionary left, had been jailed and exiled by Banzer's
government.
   Paz Zamora, 50, the son of a general, studied for the priesthood
in Argentina and was educated in Belgium. In the 1970s he was
considered a Marxist leader.
   Since he became president his government's main goal has been to
maintain economic stability.
   On the drug front, Paz Zamora has linked coca leaf eradication
to development aid in an effort to ease the disruptions of
switching from coca leaf production to other crops.
   The government says it needs several hundred million dollars to
wean farmers away from coca farming to other crops. Paz Zamora says
eradication must take place, but without leaving farmers and the
rest of the country poorer.
   He also expelled former Interior Minister Luis Arce Gomez in
December to face cocaine trafficking charges in Miami.

   A collector paid $55,000 for a letter by George
Washington in which the former president thanks an author for
dedicating a book to him, but _ since he cannot tell a lie _ admits
he hasn't read it.
   Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and autograph dealer,
said Wednesday that the letter was recently discovered in an attic
trunk in Cincinnati and sold Tuesday to Joe Maddalana of Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   In the two-page letter, which Washington wrote Aug. 15, 1798, he
thanks the Rev. Jonathan Boucher for sending him a copy of
Boucher's ``Causes &amp; Consequences of the American `Revolution'''
and for dedicating the book to him.
   But the man who supposedly admitted to chopping down his
father's cherry tree also admits he hasn't had time to read the
book.
   Here's how he breaks the news:
   ``I know not how it happened, but the fact is that your favour
of the 8th of Nov. last year is but received; and at a time when
both public and private business presses so hard upon me as to
afford no leisure to give the (book) ... a perusal.''
   Washington wasn't kidding. According to John Riley, a research
librarian at the Washington homestead at Mount Vernon, relations
between the United States and Napoleonic France were so tense at
that time that the old general was officially reactivated briefly.
   Washington alludes to those troubles, describing France as ``a
nation whose intermeddling &amp; restless disposition, and attempts to
divide, distract and influence the measures of other countries''
threatens peace.
   Washington writes that since he hasn't read the book ``it
follows of course that I can express no opinion with respect to its
political content'' _ an inhibition that, if widely shared, would
have severely curtailed cocktail party conversation in the years to
come.
   But he tells Boucher that ``there is no man in either country
(England or America) more zealously devoted to Peace and good
understanding between the two nations than I am. ... ``PEACE with
all the world is my sincere wish. I am sure it is our true policy.
And ... the ardent desire of the Government.''
   Washington's declarations of love of peace, Hamilton claimed,
are what makes the letter ``probably the most important Washington
letter still in private hands.''
   That's debatable, Riley said. He noted that peace is generally
popular, and he cited a 1789 letter still in private hands in which
Washington tells Secretary of War Henry Knox that his impending
inauguration as president makes him feel ``not unlike a culprit ...
going to his execution.''
   Dorothy Twohig, another Washington scholar, said the letter is
particularly interesting because Boucher was a well-known loyalist
who spent time in England during the revolution. She said that
although Hamilton sold the original, poor copies of the letter are
on file in some libraries.
   Hamilton said the letter was part of a Cincinnati man's
autograph collection that was discovered recently at the late
collector's house by his two elderly daughters. The letter was
framed and in good condition, he said, except for a small portion
which was nibbled away by mice.

<HEAD>Bush Sleeps Aboard Air Force One: `Not a Security Thing'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Question: How does frequent flyer George Bush
avoid jet fatigue when he has a pre-dawn flight?
   Answer: He sleeps on his plane overnight in a heavily guarded
airport hangar.
   That was the solution Bush chose in order to arrive refreshed in
Colombia today for a four-nation drug summit.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's unusual
sleeping arrangements had nothing to do with elaborate security
precautions surrounding the summit.
   ``It's a sleep thing, not a security thing,'' Fitzwater said.
``He feels it's the best way for him to get the most sleep without
having to wake up in the middle of the night.''
   Bush said he did the same thing a few times while he was vice
president.
   To reach Colombia by mid-morning, Air Force One had to take off
well before dawn.
   Bush decided to sleep aboard Air Force One in a hangar at
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., instead of waking up early to catch a
helicopter flight to the airport.
   Bush's stateroom on the plane is equipped with a full-size bed.
Fitzwater said experience has shown that Bush can sleep right
through takeoff.

<HEAD>Report Says Surveillance Used as Workplace ``Technological Whip''</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employers use electronic devices to keep tabs
on workers at an alarming rate that is increasing stress in the
workplace, according to a report released today by a workers'
advocacy group.
   Computers and other electronic equipment are used for several
types of worker surveillance, such as allowing employers to listen
in on phone calls, count keystrokes and gauge the amount of time
workers spend on transactions, said the report by a Cleveland-based
group called 9to5, Working Women Education Fund.
   Computer monitoring _ used to evaluate about 10 million American
workers, many times without their knowledge or permission _ has
become a ``technological whip'' for keeping workers in line, the
report said.
   Businesses contend monitoring is merely an extension of normal
supervision.
   ``Employer monitoring is a necessary tool for employers to
review work progress,'' said Roger Middleton, an attorney for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   He said monitoring is also used to train workers and promote
those who perform well. In addition, hidden video cameras serve
security functions, he said.
   Sharon Danann, research director for the group that conducted
the report, said a certain degree of monitoring is acceptable, but
managers rely too heavily on it to assess workers' efficiency.
   ``Supervisors seem to go berserk with this stuff. It becomes an
overboard effort at control,'' she said.
   The report included case studies of workers who had complained
about job surveillance to the group's ``Computer Spying Hotline''
that was established last year.
   The studies showed computers are often used by airlines and
phone companies to time how long workers spend on the phone with
customers. For ticket agents, the computers show how successful the
agent was at booking flights.
   Some hospitals require nurses to carry a small computer for
logging data so supervisors will know how much time they spend with
each patient, the report said. In addition, a growing number of
truck drivers are required to turn in printouts showing their
speed, the gears they use and the time and length of their stops,
it said.
   Surveys show that monitored workers are more likely than
non-monitored workers to describe their jobs as stressful, the
report said.
   Workers who complained to the hotline believed monitoring too
often ``sets up an atmosphere of suspicion and results in
heavy-handed and demeaning discipline,'' the report said.
   A woman who worked as a data entry operator for a manufacturer
in Minnesota said the firm used keystroke monitoring to track the
number of invoices processed, time per job, keystroke rate and the
number of errors.
   ``I don't think workers should be judged solely by the cold hard
data of a computer printout. As a worker, I want to be treated like
a human being, not a machine,'' the woman said.
   A software specialist who worked for a Georgia computer
manufacturer said managers could listen to any phone call without
notice and tracked the origin and destination of phone calls.
Hidden video cameras were in the ceiling and doorways of the work
room and in the lunch room, the woman said.
   Congress is considering a measure that would require employers
to give workers prior notice of the types of electronic monitoring
that would be used.

<HEAD>Ag Department Sees Farm Income on the Upswing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rise in farm income is helping financially
pressed rural banks and other lenders recover from the tough 1980s,
according to Agriculture Department analysts who forecast further
gains this year.
   ``Barring major weather problems, farm sector adjustments in the
last half of the 1980s indicate a more stable farm sector and
agricultural credit situation in the early 1990s,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said Wednesday.
   But the agency also cautioned that loan delinquency rates will
remain high by historical standards ``because farm financial stress
is still present, especially in certain areas adversely affected by
weather.''
   Farmers appear ready to take on new debt for expansion after
years of belt-tightening and paying off heavy debt loads that
persisted through much of the 1980s.
   ``The large paydown in farm debt held by major farm lenders
appears to be over, and debt is expected to grow $1 billion to $2
billion in 1990, or approximately 1 percent,'' the report said.
``Borrowing for both real and non-real estate loans should expand
in 1990, and creditworthy farmers should have ample access to
operating credit.''
   As a result banks and other commercial lenders are once again
focusing on competitive efforts to attract low-risk borrowers.
   The economic recovery in agriculture was also reflected in a
drop in agricultural bank failures last year to 24, the fewest
since 1983, the report said.
   Net cash income of farmers nationally in 1990 is currently
forecast at $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with an estimated
$53 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988. That is
money left over from gross cash income after paying cash expenses.
   However, another USDA method shows net farm income _ which takes
into account changes in inventory values, depreciation and other
factors during a calendar year _ may be in the range of $44 billion
to $49 billion, compared with last year's record of $48 billion.
   For hard-pressed farmers who may not be qualified for loans from
banks or other commercial lenders, the report said the Farmers Home
Administration could see demand for its direct loans exceed the
supply. But FmHA guaranteed loans made by commercial lenders
``should be relatively unchanged'' from last year.
   ``After steadily increasing throughout the decade, the FmHA's
direct farmer (loan) program delinquencies fell slightly to just
under $8.7 billion at mid-1989,'' the report said. ``Despite the
decline, the share of delinquent loan payments to outstanding loan
volume increased to 37.1 percent as loan volume dropped.''
   Only 35 percent of FmHA's $3.4 billion available for loan
guarantees was obligated in the 1989 fiscal year, reflecting weak
demand and greater lending authority, the report said.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has
created a new senior-level job to coordinate the Agriculture
Department's rural development efforts.
   Yeutter said Wednesday that Walter E. Hill, a former Oklahoma
state legislator will be assistant undersecretary for small
community and rural development. Since last July, Hill has been
special assistant to Roland Vautour, the undersecretary. The new
job pays $83,600 a year.
   Before coming to USDA, Hill served more than 10 years in the
Oklahoma House of Representatives. Hill, 47, was born in Liberal,
Kan.
   The Bush administration has been under pressure from many rural
advocates, including many in Congress, to push harder on rural
development, to help small towns and rural people acquire better
living standards.
   ``The key to development of our rural areas is the proper
coordination of programs and policies between local, state and
federal governments, and Walt's vast experience will make him a
valuable member of our USDA rural development team,'' Yeutter said.
   Hill has been manager and owner of a 2,000-acre irrigated farm
in Beaver and Texas counties since 1973. From 1984 until last year,
he also was chairman of the board of Added Assets Inc., an Oklahoma
City real estate firm.

   The National Farmers Union says drought aid
was the major agricultural accomplishment of Congress in 1989.
   Michael V. Dunn, the NFU's chief lobbyist on Capitol Hill, said
the $900 million disaster aid bill for farm losses due to last
year's drought was hindered by a dispute about whether the bill
should be limited to winter wheat losses or expanded to include
general crop losses.
   ``At the end, the comprehensive approach favored by NFU
prevailed,'' Dunn said in a review of 1989 legislation.
   But there were a number of setbacks, including the failure of
Congress to pass rural development legislation.
   ``It was the Senate which passed a good rural development bill,
but the House which failed to get the measure out of committee,''
he said.

<HEAD>Students Say They'll Take Environmental Concerns to Ballot Box</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

   College students say they are concerned about
the environment and many say it will be a factor when they vote, a
new survey shows.
   The National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest
conservation organization, announced the results of a poll of 500
undergraduates in four-year colleges and universities Wednesday.
   When asked what environmental issues they were familiar with, 96
percent named oil spills, with acid rain and smog in second place
at 92 percent.
   When asked what the most pressing environmental problem was, 23
percent named air pollution, 20 percent ozone depletion and 11
percent trash and garbage.
   Acid rain was one of the least frequently mentioned at 4
percent, followed by loss of tropical rain forest at 3 percent and
global warming at 2 percent.
   Three out of 10 students said they believed strongly that a
candidate's position on protecting the environment would be an
important factor in their decisions as voters and additional 41
percent said they felt ``somewhat'' that it would be.
   Tom Hughes, president of Hughes Research Corp. of Rockville,
Md., which conducted the survey, said, ``I think it's going to be
one of the issues of the '90's, if not the issue of the '90's.
   ``This is a large group of people,'' Hughes said. ``There are 8
million in four year colleges and 5 million in two-year colleges.
It is also a group with very, very strong concerns.''
   Three percent of the students said they were not at all active
on environmental issues, 32 percent somewhat inactive and 18
percent somewhat active. An additional 32 percent described
themselves as neither active nor inactive.
   However, 76 percent said they thought there was something they
personally could do to help protect the environment, such as not
littering, reducing their use of environmentally harmful products
and taking part in environmental organizations.
   Ninety-four percent said they would be willing to pay more for
products that are safe for the environment.
   ``We are tremendously encouraged by these results,'' said Jay B.
Hair, president of the federation. ``College students are
expressing a deep concern for the environment, and the overwhelming
majority are clearly willing to do something about it.''
   Sean Captain of Scranton, Pa., a student in the Georgetown
University school of foreign service in Washington, described
efforts to discourage use of Styrofoam cups on the Georgetown
campus.
   ``Everybody complains about Styrofoam, but they didn't have time
to get into it full time,'' he said. ``But when we organized a
program to see how we could get rid of it, how it could be done
economically and feasibly, we got support.''
   Three-quarters of the students said recycling of newspapers,
glass and cans should be required by all communities.
   Asked whether people should be willing to sacrifice
environmental quality for economic growth, 42 percent said they
disagreed strongly, 28 percent disagreed somewhat, 8 percent agreed
strongly, 18 percent agreed somewhat and 4 percent had no opinion.
   The survey was conducted in November. The students, ranging in
age from 17 to 24, were about evenly divided between men and women.
   The federation said the survey had a margin of error of plus or
minus five percentage points.

<HEAD>Deep Troop Cuts Save Little Money Next Year, Analysts Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dramatic cuts in the size of U.S. fighting
forces, phased in over the next five years, would do little to help
budget writers shrink next year's federal deficit, congressional
analysts say.
   The Congressional Budget Office said in its annual overview of
potential spending cuts and tax increases Wednesday that cutting
troop strength by one quarter by 1995 would save just $510 million
next year from the Bush administration's plans.
   That would be a small fraction of the $36.5 billion the
administration estimates it needs to save to reduce the fiscal 1991
deficit to $64 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law.
   The projection for the relatively small savings came as the
prospects for an armed confrontation with the Soviet Union and its
allies are dropping rapidly, and as Congress prepares to scrutinize
the Pentagon for budget savings.
   The CBO, Congress' budget analysis arm, examined 160 ways to
save money. These included a two-year delay in work on the
superconducting super collider, the research atom smasher planned
for Texas, for a savings of about $100 million next year; a $440
million gain by slightly raising the amount federal workers
contribute to their retirement benefits; and a $1.6 billion boost
by imposing a 50-cents-per-pound tax on water pollutants.
   In defense, CBO studied a scenario in which the U.S. military of
2.1 million forces would be reduced by 500,000 men and women by
1995. The first part of the reduction would occur in fiscal 1991 _
which starts Oct. 1 _ with a cut of 60,000 troops.
   The report said the reduction would save $70 billion over the
next five years when compared to the spending that would be
necessary to keep pace with the costs of inflation.
   But that total is probably unrealistically high, since the
diminishing threat from Warsaw Pact nations has put pressure on
President Bush and Congress to seek reductions in Pentagon
spending, rather than increases.
   The study acknowledged that making such steep reductions over
just five years ``could cause significant disruptions.'' The
authors said retirements and reduced enlistments would probably not
produce enough cuts, making layoffs of career soldiers likely.
   By reducing U.S. forces by 250,000 troops over the same five
years, CBO said $60 million would be saved next year from Bush's
current plans, and $38 billion over five years compared to
increases with inflation.
   In his 1991 budget released last month, Bush proposed reducing
troop strength by 38,000.
   The report said canceling further spending for the radar-evading
B-2 stealth bomber would save $1.1 billion from an inflation
increase.
   Limiting spending on Star Wars _ the proposed antimissile
research system _ to just research, rather than deployment, would
save $860 million from an increase with inflation. And retiring all
four Navy battleships in 1991, rather than the two the
administration plans to mothball, would save $75 million next year.
   The government would earn $2.8 billion next year by doubling the
16-cent per pack tax on cigarettes. Placing a one-time tax on motor
vehicles based on the sulfur oxides and other pollutants they emit,
averaging $250 per vehicle, would raise $1.9 billion in 1991.
   Of the 36 ideas for raising revenues CBO analyzed, none involved
cutting the capital gains tax rate, a favorite idea of Bush. In the
past, CBO has argued that the proposal loses money in the long run.
Bush says cutting taxes paid when real estate and other property is
sold would stimulate the economy and produce more revenue for the
government.
   CBO's options, which the agency studies but does not endorse,
usually share the same fate that awaits most plans to reduce the
deficit: they offend one constituency or another and rarely are
enacted into law.

   Placido Domingo and Shirley Verrett sang the
title roles in ``Samson et Dalila'' when the Metropolitan Opera
presented the Saint-Saens opera for the first time this season.
   Alain Fondary of Paris, who made his Met debut in 1988, sounded
rich and authoritative as the high priest before the capacity
audience Wednesday night.
   All three principals were singing their roles at the Met for the
first time in this production, which dates from 1964.
   Charles Dutoit conducted the orchestra, which performed well.
The chorus, which is so important in this opera, sounded fine.
   Domingo sang splendidly, making for a strong, heroic Samson. He
made final ringing phrases very stirring and acted effectively.
   Miss Verrett looked absolutely dazzling. However, the weakness
of her singing diminished the dramatic aspects of the tale. She was
so shaky that one wondered whether she could finish the opera. Some
of her singing wasn't audible. On the plus side, she wasn't shrill
and conveyed a honeyed, seductive tone, especially in the lower
part of her register.
   In Act 3, Zachary Solov choreographed a hot dance for a couple
in flesh-colored leotards. Kimberly Graves and Richardo Costa were
spellbinding, never looking silly. Costa caused gasps _ even from
people who'd seen the routine before _ when he swung Graves around
and dropped her from the Temple of Dagon altar into the arms of
other dancers.
   Michael Devlin of Chicago and John Macurdy of Detroit were
excellent as the Philistine commander Abimelech and the old Hebrew
who warns Samson against Dalila.
   But Samson, who had enjoyed a good look at her, paid no heed.

<BYLINE>Airline Industry: Only `Pockets of Problems'

<TEXT>
   Airlines are pleased with a study that finds
only ``pockets of problems'' in the industry, but there's concern
on Capitol Hill some travelers may be paying too much in cities
where there's little competition.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said the results of a
nine-month study of airline competition released Wednesday shows
deregulation of the industry a decade ago has brought more service
and lower fares.
   But the report also confirmed congestion and higher fares at
some key airports.
   ``Deregulation has worked and the study clearly points out that
competition in the airline industry remains strong ... with only
pockets of problems,'' Skinner told a news conference.
   The problems, he said, include increased congestion at some
major airports and 18.7 percent higher-than-average fares at eight
hub airports where a single airline dominates.
   ``If one lives in the pocket of a problem, it's serious,'' said
Steve Hilton, spokesman for Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., a strong
critic of decreasing airline competition.
   Hilton said Danforth believes the Transportation Department
study adds to evidence of excessive fares on routes where
competition is minimal and underscores the need for legislation to
increase competition.
   ``The report shows that deregulation is not delivering to the
traveling public fare benefits if you happen to live near a
non-competitive airport,'' said Hilton. He said Danforth believes
it is ``intolerable to have an industry that is neither regulated
nor competitive.''
   Several bills are pending in Congress to strengthen government
control over airlines and encourage competition. One would restore
some government authority to regulate fares and routes.
   Only about 10 percent of the total passenger hours flown are in
the higher fare markets, Skinner said. Passengers generally get
better service, including non-stop flights and more frequent
flights, for the higher fares, he said.
   ``Air travelers have benefited under deregulation through more
service at lower cost,'' the secretary said. ``How can you complain
when 90 percent of people in this country today are flying with
discount fares?
   The number of airlines increased from 30 to 38 between 1978,
when airlines were deregulated, and 1984, but there are only 29
large carriers, with eight of them providing 90 percent of the
service.
   The study, which analyzed data from 1979 to 1988, brought
criticism from a business travelers group and praise from the
airline industry.
   ``In terms of day-to-day operations and for people who are
really biting the bullet and out there flying, I think there are a
lot of problems in this report,'' said Margie Crace, president of
the National Business Travel Association.
   She said deregulation has brought delayed flights, lost luggage
and ``air fares that are increasing at a rapid rate.''
   American Airlines Chairman Robert L. Crandall said the study
confirms that deregulation has created ``a strong, vibrant and
dynamic marketplace in which to compete.''
   He said it has saved consumers over $100 million in 10 years
with a wide range of discount fares and has given smaller
communities ``air service they would get no other way.''
   Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
which represents major carriers, said the study underscores the
healthy competition among airlines and ``demonstrates that there is
no basis to reregulate the industry in any way.''
   A study conducted last year for the association concluded there
was no correlation between high fares and the reduced number of
airlines or the concentration of airlines around hubs through which
they feed most of their flights.
   The DOT study, however, said fares at eight airports where a
single carrier has established an operating hub averaged were
higher than fares at other airports. A more limited study by
Congress' General Accounting Office last year also found higher
fares in and out of hubs.
   Airlines set up hub operations to consolidate their operations
at one airport, saving administrative and maintenance costs.
   The most concentrated hubs are Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Dayton,
St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Memphis, Salt Lake City and Charlotte, N.C.
Fares also are higher for flights to larger cities between 250 and
1,000 miles from these hubs, the report said.
   Fares overall have increased 14 percent since deregulation, but
that represents a decline when adjusted for inflation, the study
said.

<HEAD>Oscar Voters Favor Predictable Over the Daring</HEAD>

   Oscar voters all but ignored
acclaimed, daring films like ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' and ``Do the
Right Thing'' and cast their lots for mainstream titles such as
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   At the same time, the voters overlooked the year's box-office
blockbusters ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' and
``Lethal Weapon 2.''
   The nominations by the more than 4,700 members of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences suggested that if independent
filmmakers were looking for praise from Hollywood, they were
looking in the wrong place.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' writer-director Spike Lee's fiery
account of racial confrontation in New York City, landed on 81 film
critics' top 10 lists, and took the best picture, best director and
best music awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.
   Yet when nominations for the 62nd Academy Awards were announced
Wednesday, ``Do the Right Thing'' could do no right, collecting
just two nominations _ supporting actor for Danny Aiello and
original screenplay for Lee.
   ``In a little way I'm happy, in a little way I'm disappointed,''
Lee said. ``We got jerked outta best director, best film, I think
my cinematographer ... did a great job, I think my editor did a
great job. ... I know in my heart that my father, Bill Lee,
deserved a nomination for best score.''
   While ``Do the Right Thing'' was financed and distributed by
Universal Pictures, the film's inventive style and rough tone ran
against the Hollywood grain. So did ``Drugstore Cowboy'' and ``sex,
lies and videotape,'' both made and distributed outside the studio
system.
   ``Drugstore Cowboy,'' a gritty examination of drug addicts on
the lam, was named film of the year by the National Society of Film
Critics. It collected no Oscar nominations.
   ``Sex, lies and videotape,'' the provocative character study
considered one of the decade's most successful independent films,
took the top prize at last year's Cannes film festival. Academy
voters gave it just one nomination, for best original screenplay.
   Among the more unconventional movies collecting multiple
nominations were ``My Left Foot'' with five nominations and ``Henry
V'' with three.
   The blockbusters _ ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and
``Look Who's Talking'' _ captured only five nominations combined.
``Batman'' co-star Jack Nicholson wasn't nominated, and music
composer Danny Elfman was shut out, too.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' focusing on a difficult Southern Jewish
widow and her black chauffeur, carried off the most nominations,
nine, including best picture and best actors for Morgan Freeman,
Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   Aykroyd's nomination was one of most unusual, as the actor has
rarely been taken seriously in the critical community.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to anti-war
protester after a Vietnam war wound that left him a paraplegic,
drew eight nominations, including best picture.
   Also nominated for top picture were ``Dead Poets Society,''
``Field of Dreams'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   ``My Left Foot'' best supporting actress nominee Brenda Fricker
said from Ireland that she was surprised, and her comments hinted
at the wide gulf separating the Academy from the critical community.
   ``I had won the Los Angeles Film Critics' awards, and thought,
well, in the film center of the world, the critics said you've done
something right. It never crossed my mind for one second I would be
nominated,'' she said.
   In the studio race, Universal led all comers with 17
nominations, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. had 11, Tri-Star
collected nine, Paramount and Disney had eight, Miramax seven,
Orion six, Columbia five, Samuel Goldwyn three and MGM-UA collected
one.
   For the second time in two years, voters did not nominate the
year's most acclaimed documentary. ``Roger &amp; Me,'' filmmaker
Michael Moore's satirical perspective on General Motors and the
people of Flint, Mich., was overlooked.
   In 1989, the Academy failed to nominate Errol Morris' ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' which led to freedom for Randall Dale Adams after more
than a decade on Texas' death row.
   The winners, selected by members of the academy, will be
presented March 26 and broadcast live by ABC-TV.

   Its unification drive bolstered by the Allied
agreement in Ottawa, West Germany is giving crippled East Germany
$3.6 billion in immediate aid to tide it over until free elections
next month.
   Another $1 billion will go to resettle some of the hundreds of
thousands of East Germans who have abandoned their homeland and
fled to the West.
   The amount of aid fell far short of what East German Premier
Hans Modrow had requested. West Germany made it clear it would not
commit more funds until after the March 18 balloting, the first
free elections for a country founded as a Communist state 40 years
ago.
   Though the money is earmarked for specific East German programs,
none of it will go directly to the government of the Communist
premier, who likely will be ousted by voters.
   Several East German Cabinet members who accompanied Modrow for
two days of talks in Bonn were displeased with how the delegation
was received; one described the tone of the talks as ``somewhat
condescending.''
   Modrow had requested $9 billion in immediate direct aid on
Tuesday but was turned down by the government of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   The two-day summit in Bonn, which ended Wednesday, was
overshadowed by the landmark agreement in Ottawa by the Soviet
Union, the United States, France and Britain that sets up a
procedure for formal talks on reunification.
   The agreement by the four World War II Allies that defeated and
divided Germany 45 years ago is the first step to a timetable for
unification and clear recognition that such a merger is inevitable.
   The talks will take place in two parts. The two Germanys first
will discuss merging their economies and other domestic issues. The
second phase, to include the four wartime powers, will deal with
the strategic and global implications of a united Germany,
particularly its military allegiance.
   During the talks between the Germanys, West Germany has a
commanding position because of its vibrant economy, which will be
needed to bail out the financially ailing eastern state.
   West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said Wednesday that the
government agreed at a Cabinet meeting to spend $2.4 billion to
modernize East Germany's aging factories, repair roads, install a
new phone system and other ``immediate measures.''
   The 1990 budget supplement also provides $1 billion to cope with
the costs of tens of thousands of East Germans resettling in West
Germany and another $1.2 billion for a contingency fund for
unforeseen expenses related to East German reforms.
   Officials said the funds were designated for specific projects
and would not be at Modrow's disposal to cover daily expenses and
the East German government's mounting debts.
   Modrow, whose interim government includes non-Communists and
opposition figures, lacked a consensus in his Cabinet to reach any
significant agreement on West Germany's plan to unify the two
countries' economies.
   Modrow and Kohl agreed only to set up a commission to study the
issue.
   Such a step would make the mighty West German mark East
Germany's currency. East Germans are concerned about protecting
their savings, social security benefits and subsidized rents, and
are also worried about massive unemployment expected to result form
such a move.
   West Germany has pressed Modrow's government to introduce
radical free-market reforms before pouring massive aid into East
Germany. The East German government, while making cautious moves to
free the economy, has resisted going further with capitalist reform.
   The main stumbling block to a unified Germany is expected to be
a decision on its military alignment. The Soviets want it to be
neutral, while the West expects it to be part of NATO, the Western
alliance that includes West Germany.
   Poland, twice conquered by Germany, has insisted that it be
allowed to take part in the reunification talks. Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki has called for a peace treaty recognizing the
present Polish-German border.
   German unification became more than an oft-spoken idea after a
popular revolution last fall ousted East Germany's hard-line
Communist leaders, opened the Berlin Wall and led to democratic
reforms.

<HEAD>Lawmakers to Consider Changes in Deposit Insurance Ceiling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is taking the first tentative step
toward considering changes in federal deposit insurance, an issue
regarded as too hot to handle in last year's savings and loan
bailout.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, scheduled a hearing on the subject Feb. 21, saying
Wednesday, ``Congress should not regard the $100,000 per account
insurance as a divine right.''
   The hearing, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.
William Seidman and General Accounting Office head Charles A.
Bowsher, promises to be the opening shot in the most explosive
financial industry question before Congress in the next few years.
   Many private experts say deposit insurance helped encourage the
risky behavior that created mammoth S&amp;L losses. But others fear
tinkering with the insurance could destabilize the entire financial
system, making banks much more prone to runs by depositors.
   Last year, Congress did not even consider changing the $100,000
limit, postponing the question by ordering the Treasury Department
and GAO to prepare comprehensive studies of the subject.
   Federal insurance of accounts up to $2,500 began in 1934. Over
the years, the limit was raised, with the last big step, from
$40,000 to $100,000, coming in 1980.
   Gonzalez said few people have bank accounts that large and
questioned ``the public policy of government guarantees for the
most affluent in the society.''
   Coverage of $100,000 ``was enacted under great secrecy ... in
1980 and was never fully examined,'' he said in a statement. ``Not
only do we need to examine the absolute limits of the coverage, but
to determine whether the multiple accounts maintained by some
depositors are unnecessarily increasing the risks to the funds.''
   Congress isn't expected to act until next year after completion
of the Treasury and GAO studies, but already the battle lines are
being drawn.
   Small banks, in particular, are opposing any reduction of
deposit insurance. They argue that, no matter what the rules, big
banks would continue to enjoy de facto protection because
regulators will bail them out rather than risk the collapse of the
banking system.
   Two weeks ago, budget director Richard Darman, in the
administration's 1991 budget, suggested consideration of several
sweeping reforms. Without endorsing any option, Darman listed a
range of possible changes, including:
   _scrupulously enforcing the existing $100,000 limit and forcing
big depositors and other creditors to accept some loss.
   _forcing all depositors to bear some loss through a deductible.
   _allowing insured deposits to be used for only a limited range
of safe investments.
   _charging banks with risky investments a higher deposit
insurance premium.
   _making the government the ``catastrophic'' insurer that steps
in only after the failure of private insurance.
   ``Darman has laid out the system he would like to see and it's
very different from the system we have now,'' said Kenneth A.
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of America.
   ``Financial confidence is a very fragile commodity and I really
think if you begin (changing) deposit insurance, you're undermining
the stability of our financial system,'' Guenther said.
   However, President Bush's economic report, issued last week by
White House economic adviser Michael Boskin, says deposit insurance
``can encourage excessive risk taking'' but also has ``worked very
well in preventing ... panics.''
   The only reform option mentioned by Boskin is charging higher
insurance premiums to banks posing a greater hazard to the
insurance fund.
   Last fall, in hearings conducted by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,
chairman of the panel's financial institutions subcommittee,
private analysts said the commercial bank insurance fund, although
solvent, is dangerously weak. Seidman, however, has said there are
enough reserves to cover foreseeable bank failures.

<HEAD>Study: Blacks More Susceptible than Whites to Tuberculosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black Americans suffer six times more tuberculosis
than whites do, and one important reason appears to be a genetic
susceptibility to the disease, according to a study today.
   The research found that when living conditions are identical,
black people are twice as likely as whites to get infected with the
TB bacteria.
   The relatively high rate of TB among blacks has traditionally
been blamed on crowded housing and other conditions of poverty.
While social factors undoubtedly play a central role, the study
suggests that innate susceptibility also contributes.
   ``We found that there is a systemic difference between whites
and blacks,'' said Dr. William W. Stead. ``Whites seem to be more
able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to
establish an infection.''
   Stead, a tuberculosis specialist at the Arkansas Department of
Health, discovered the racial difference while analyzing health
statistics from nursing homes and prisons.
   ``It's a very intriguing finding,'' commented Dr. George
Comstock of Johns Hopkins University. ``I never quite believe
anything until somebody replicates it. But I don't know of any real
holes in this one.''
   At the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
Dr. George Curlin called the findings ``plausible and provocative.''
   However, he added: ``I'm scared to death that people are going
to say this explains it all and forget everything else. Of the
total six times difference, what proportion is attributable to
biology and what to social factors? I would say that biology is
relatively minor.''
   Stead's study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine,
was based largely on a review of 25,398 elderly people who were
free of TB infection when they were admitted to Arkansas nursing
homes. When they were retested at least two months later, 14
percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites showed evidence of new
infections.
   Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black
inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the
bacteria while incarcerated.
   Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a
racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB
bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem to be more prone
to tuberculosis.
   About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the
United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths. In the population at
large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as
whites.
   An estimated 10 million Americans are believed to be infected
with the bacteria but not sick. The disease, which attacks the
lungs, has long been associated with poor, crowded living
conditions.
   Stead's study found that blacks got infected more readily than
whites, regardless of the race of the person who initially brought
the infection into the nursing home. In homes where the initial
source of the disease was white, 17 percent of blacks and 12
percent of whites caught the infection. When the primary source was
black, 12 percent of blacks and 8 percent of whites contracted the
bacteria.
   This phase of the study also suggests, however, that infected
whites are more potent spreaders of the infection than are blacks.
   Stead speculated that whites have evolved better defenses
against TB, because the bacteria has long been common in Europe and
parts of Africa north of the Sahara, but is traditionally rare in
sub-Saharan Africa.
   By contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites
to malaria, which is common in Africa.
   In the other study, Dr. Alfred Crowle of Webb-Waring Lung
Institute at the University of Colorado found differences in the
resistance of germ-eating blood cells called macrophages. In
blacks, these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections.
   ``This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to
tuberculosis than are white people,'' said Crowle.
   At the turn of the century, TB was the nation's leading cause of
death. The number of cases fell steadily in recent decades until
1984.
   Experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of
the emergence of the AIDS virus, which weaken the body's resistance
to TB bacteria. Others possible factors include homelessness and
immigration of people from areas where the disease is still common.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney promised
``unequivocal'' support for South Korea Wednesday while bracing for
a cooler reception in the Philippines. President Bush offered ``a
little free advice'' to Corazon Aquino, who has pointedly declined
to meet Cheney when he arrives this weekend.
   Cheney's trip to Seoul was the first leg on a two-week tour
designed to reassess the U.S. military posture in Asia and the
Pacific _ including talks on reducing the numbers of American
troops and getting the allies to pay more for their support.
   But with Cheney's visit to Manila still days away, Bush signaled
his displeasure with the Philippines president for saying she
wouldn't meet with Cheney after his arrival Monday.
   ``She clearly feels that a visit at this time might complicate
the status quo there today in the Philippines and that's her right
to see or not see who she wants,'' Bush said.
   ``My own view is that she can learn a great deal from Dick
Cheney about the way we view the very important United States
presence in the Pacific,'' Bush said in an interview with Newsday.
   Saying he would offer Mrs. Aquino ``a little free advice,'' Bush
said, ``Maybe you could learn from the man _ or he could learn from
you, Madam President.''
   Cheney arrives in the Philippines on Sunday after a stopover
Saturday in Hong Kong. He also will visit Japan before returning to
Washington Feb. 24.
   Upon arrival late Wednesday, Cheney hastened to reassure his
South Korean counterpart, Lee Sang Hoon, of America's intention to
help support the South against any threat from communist North
Korea.
   ``The U.S. commitment to Korea remains firm and unequivocal.
U.S. troops will remain in Korea as long as they are needed to
guarantee the peace and the Korean and American peoples and
governments want them to remain,'' Cheney said following a review
of a color guard by Korean troops at the Seoul air base.
   Cheney also offered assurances that there would be no ``drastic
reduction'' of the 43,000 U.S. troops that have been based in Korea
under a 1954 mutual defense treaty.
   Officials traveling with Cheney said he told South Korean
officials the Pentagon wants to slash its forces in Asia by 10
percent to 12 percent _ at least 12,000 troops _ over the next
three years.
   They said said some 5,000 of the troops would be pulled out of
South Korea, with an additional 7,000 to 9,400 being withdrawn from
the Philippines and Japan. There are 120,000 U.S. troops based in
the three nations.
   A senior Pentagon official told reporters the secretary and his
delegation also intend to ask South Korea to increase its $300
million annual contribution to the U.S. defense to around $700
million by 1993.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
expected the discussion to be ``a very difficult one'' for both
sides and that no resolution was anticipated during the secretary's
visit.
   The official said he thought a final decision on any increased
South Korean contribution may not be hammered out until another
round of discussions, scheduled for fall.
   The official said the delegation intends to suggest some numbers
to the South Koreans but he didn't expect a resolution until
October. The official said the Asian nations hosting U.S. forces
``are very sensitive to being pushed around about money.''
   ``The important thing is the trend. Are they moving in the right
direction?'' the official said, describing the negotiations as
``sort of a Kabuki,'' referring to the stylized Japanese drama.
   Cheney is slated to spend three days in Korea, meeting with U.S.
and Korean military officials as well as South Korean President Roh
Tae Woo.
   He is also slated to spend a day traveling north of Seoul to the
demilitarized zone to observe the barriers separating North and
South Korea.

   The chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee says the president's proposal to scrap federal spending
on crop insurance will force Congress to restructure the program
this year.
   ``I say the program as it now stands is dead, but not the
concept of crop insurance with federal involvement, restructured
hopefully in a better way,'' Rep. Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, said
Wednesday.
   De la Garza said a Bush administration plan to eliminate the
program was ``forcing our hand'' into enacting reforms.
   Although President Bush proposed scrapping federal participation
in the multimillion-dollar crop insurance program in his 1991
budget, the administration is now backing away from that
recommendation.
   ``President Bush does not necessarily favor elimination,''
Cooper Evans, the president's agriculture adviser, said Wednesday.
``This action was a good way to get Congress's attention'' to the
need for changes.
   ``There aren't too terribly many happy with the way it's working
now, including the administration, so it's probably just as well
that they used the budget so that kind of helped us to work and
come up with a better program,'' de la Garza said.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., chairman of the House Agriculture
subcommittee on conservation, credit and rural development, is
preparing to introduce legislation to restructure crop insurance,
an aide said.
   The federal government spends about $450 million to $500 million
a year for its share of the crop insurance program as Congress has
been approving almost yearly disaster relief legislation to bail
out farmers whose uninsured crops were destroyed by extreme weather.
   Bush's proposal to scrap the program appears to be unsettling
farmers as well as farm belt lawmakers.
   One complaint has been that the premiums are too high and the
coverage too low. The Bush administration and members of Congress
say farmers have also been wary of buying crop insurance because of
Congress' willingness to spend huge sums on disaster relief.
   Evans said the Bush administration's believes the government
can't continue to fund the expensive crop insurance program at the
same time Congress passes yearly disaster bills.
   ``It's fair to say on the administration's side that it isn't
clear to us how a pure crop insurance program can preclude the
Congress from doing disaster bills when it sees fit,'' Evans said.
   About half of all acres in production in 1989 were covered by
crop insurance, said Kellye Eversole, executive director of the
Crop Insurance Study commission, up from about 30 percent to 35
percent in 1988. But part of the increase was due to a requirement
that farmers receiving disaster aid in 1988 take crop insurance in
1989.
   Rep. Bill Sarpalius, D-Texas, said members of Agriculture
Committee have ``accepted the fact'' that the program must be
reformed.
   ``The question is, how do you pay for it,'' said Sarpalius.

<DATELINE>DRYDEN, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The slayings were horrifying _ a couple and
their two children bound hand and foot, shot in the back of the
head, doused with gasoline and set on fire in their suburban dream
house.
   The motive was heartbreaking.
   Robbery.
   The take: a pair of women's sneakers and some underwear, diamond
earrings, a television and VCR and $200 cash.
   With one suspect killed in a police shootout and another in
custody but not talking, police remain baffled by the brutality of
the slayings. But criminal justice experts say seemingly random
crimes are becoming more common in this country as a society
obsessed with feeling good becomes desensitized to violence.
   ``More and more we see criminals who are willing to use lethal
force if necessary,'' said James Alan Fox, professor of criminal
justice at Boston's Northeastern University.
   ``To a sociopath, even $5 could be more important than the lives
of four people.''
   State police allege that robbery was the motive that led Michael
Kinge and his mother to the large gray house in the affluent Ellis
Hollow community the night of Dec. 22.
   Credit cards and a bank access card taken from the home were
later used to make about $1,650 worth of purchases at malls in
suburban Syracuse and Auburn and to withdraw $200 from a cash
machine.
   But the robbers decided to leave no witnesses, Capt. Carl Shaver
said.
   Pillowcases were tied over the heads of Dolores and Warren A.
``Tony'' Harris and their 11-year-old son, Marc. Their feet and
hands were bound, and each was shot in the back of the head.
   The Harrises' 15-year-old daughter, Shelby, was found in a
different room. She had been sexually assaulted before being shot
in the head.
   Michael Kinge, who would have been charged with the family's
murders, died in a shootout Feb. 7 as police tried to arrest him at
his Dryden apartment.
   His 54-year-old mother, Shirley, a petite woman with
gray-streaked hair, was arrested and charged with arson, murder and
possession of stolen property. Police say she has told them little.
   The involvement of Mrs. Kinge, a cook and cleaner with no
criminal record, remains unclear. Police said her fingerprint was
found on a gasoline can at the crime scene, but they have not said
whether she took part in the killings or even if she was in the
house when they occurred.
   Dryden Town Judge Edwin Sweetland on Tuesday ordered Mrs. Kinge
held in lieu of $25,000 cash bail or $50,000 property bond on the
arson charge. But because prosecutors presented no evidence on the
murder and stolen property charges, Sweetland said Mrs. Kinge could
be released on her own recognizance on those charges if she raised
the bail for the arson charge.
   Michael Kinge had run afoul of the law before. The 33-year-old
sometime maintenance worker had a record of arrests for burglary
and robbery.
   After a 1982 arrest for weapons possession, Kinge told police he
regretted not ``shooting it out'' with the arresting officer and
killing as many police as possible, said state police
Superintendent Thomas Constantine.
   Jack Levin, a sociologist at Northeastern University and
co-author with Fox of a book on mass murder, said the brutality and
precision of the Harris slayings suggests a killer who took
pleasure in causing pain.
   FBI statistics show the incidence of violent crime _ rapes,
murders, robberies and aggravated assaults _ has climbed by 18
percent during the past five years. Local officials backed up those
statistics.
   ``We've seen more robberies, more injuries during the course of
robberies, and more violent homicides where the victims are
tortured,'' said Howard Relin, Monroe County district attorney.
   Much of that increase is drug-related, though police say drugs
apparently were not a factor in the Harris killings.
   Officials also blame other factors _ violence on television and
movies and the disintegration of societal restraints.
   Fox and Levin say the pop psychology messages of ``guilt is
bad'' and ``be assertive'' have led to a more sociopathic society
in which people feel little concern for others.
   ``For those who already lack the capacity for remorse, who lack
a strong moral sense of what is right or wrong, this is giving them
license to commit hideous crimes,'' Levin said.
   ``It used to be `I'm OK, you're OK,''' Fox said. ``Now it's `I'm
OK and you're dead.'''

<HEAD>Students Taking Longer to Finish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   College students are taking six to 10 years to
earn a degree, according to a study that says only 15 percent
complete a bachelor's degree four years after high school.
   ``The picture of the average American college student today is
not the picture that many of us have in our minds, based upon our
own experiences 15, 20 and 25 years ago,'' said Oscar F. Porter,
author of the study released Wednesday.
   ``It's clear that completing an undergraduate college degree in
four years is not the norm in either the public or independent
sector,'' he said.
   The National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities
said the survey showed that six years after high school graduation,
46 percent of the students had earned a degree.
   Counting both those who went straight to college and those who
took some time off after high school, 55 percent had either earned
a degree or were still working on one six years after high school
graduation.
   ``While students in the independent sector are more likely to
have completed their degrees in the traditional four years than
students in the public sector, the overall degree completion rate
offers little solace for either sector,'' Porter added.
   Among private colleges, 54 percent of students who enrolled
straight out of high school completed the degree in six years; for
public institutions, 43 percent finished in six years.
   The study noted a half-century of research has shown a
remarkable stability in the fraction of students starting college
who win a degree _ about 50 percent.
   But Institute President Richard Rosser said it took less time in
the 1950s and 1960s. However, he offered no figures from those
decades for comparison.
   ``The (completion) rates are historically still essentially the
same,'' said Rosser.
   ``We'll probably see many more students taking 10 years to
complete a degree,'' he added.
   The study drew its conclusions from the Education Department's
``High School and Beyond'' data base, a national survey of what
happened to 28,000 high school seniors in the class of 1980.

   The dollar closed higher agaisnt the yen Thursday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange surged.
   The dollar closed at 144.45 yen, up 0.10 yen from Wednesday's
144.35-yen finish. It opened at 144.58 yen and ranged between
144.42 yen and 144.75 yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 316.10 points, or 0.85
percent, closing at 27,471.99. It rose 48.86 points Wednesday.
   Dealers attributed the stock index's jump to opinion polls
released by major Japanese newspapers showing a probable victory
for the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's national
election.
   ``Reassured by the polls, many market players became quite
optimistic about the election results, which boosted buying,'' said
Kazuyuki Suzuki, a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co.
   The market's major concern has been whether the pro-business
governing party can maintain its control of the lower house of
Japan's parliament, which is up for grabs in the election. The
party lost its majority in the upper house last summer.
   In currency dealings, the dollar strengthened as market players
reckoned little fallout from the bankruptcy filing of Drexel
Burnham Lambert would hit Japanese financial markets, traders said.
   A Bank of Tokyo dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the U.S. currency's trend was not strong, as the majority of market
players stayed on the sidelines.

<HEAD>Death Penalty Extended for Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singapore intensified its anti-drug campaign
today by extending the death penalty to cover traffickers in
cocaine, opium and marijuana.
   Execution by hanging is now mandatory for those convicted of
trafficking, manufacturing, importing or exporting more than 1.06
ounces of cocaine, 17.6 ounces of marijuana, 7.05 ounces of hashish
and 2.6 pounds of opium.
   Under the new law, possession of those amounts is equated with
trafficking.
   ``We have contained the drug problem but it has not been
eradicated. Drugs are still quite readily available in the
region,'' said Poh Geok Ek, director the Central Narcotics Bureau.
   Before the law was amended, the death penalty applied only to
people convicted of trafficking in more than half an ounce of
heroin and more than 1.06 ounces of morphine.
   ``We recognize the potential of addicts going for substitute
drugs,'' said Poh. ``That is why there is a need for stiffer
punishment for cocaine, cannabis and opium offenses.''
   The drug law was amended Nov. 30 by Parliament, and it took
effect today. Since 1975, 37 people have been sentenced to death
under the law and 26 hanged.
   Home Affairs Minister Shunmugam Jayakumar said extending the
death penalty would cut the inflow of marijuana and help deal with
Singapore's drug problem.
   Narcotics experts said addicts in the country of 2.6 million
often start using marijuana before switching to heroin. Officials
estimate there are 9,000 addicts, about 85 percent of them using
smokeable heroin.
   By extending the death penalty to include other drugs, the
authorities also hope to deter international crime syndicates from
using Singapore as a relay point for shipments to other countries.
   Southeast Asia is the main supplier of heroin smuggled into the
United States and a leading supplier to Europe. Most of it comes
from eastern Burma, Thailand and northern Laos, a region known as
the ``Golden Triangle.''
   Opium use has a long history in the region, especially among
migrant Chinese laborers imported by the British, who controlled
the opium trade early in this century. There were about 75,000
registered opium smokers at the time it was outlawed after World
War II.

<DATELINE>TIMES BEACH, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Beach has been a boarded-up ghost
town since the federal government bought up all 801 homes and
businesses seven years ago and moved the people out after the
discovery of dioxin.
   Now, the government is finally close to building a huge
incinerator to clean up the highly toxic compound and heal the
deserted town, a grim reminder to former residents of lives turned
upside down by their evacuation.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency plans to burn all the
soil that was contaminated in the 1970s by dioxin-tainted oil
sprayed on unpaved streets to keep the dust down. The agency also
wants to treat contaminated soil from other sites in eastern
Missouri, leaving it almost 100 percent clean.
   It says the incinerator would be dismantled afterward, but a
vocal contingent of neighbors who fear for their safety is trying
to block the incinerator, which they say will become a permanent
fixture.
   ``It's spooky,'' said Eureka Mayor Otis Nelson. ``How would you
like to live next to it? How would you like to encourage
development next to it?''
   Nelson is so concerned he's advocating that his town annex the
neighboring wasteland of Times Beach to gain some leverage about
what happens there, even though it would mean increased liability.
   ``We have no choice but to take that risk,'' Nelson said.
   Former residents of the community, about 20 miles southwest of
St. Louis, just want the cleanup to begin, which all sides agree is
long overdue.
   ``If this cleanup doesn't take place, I'm afraid Times Beach is
still going to be sitting there like it is today, five to 10 years
down the road,'' said Marilyn Leistner, a former mayor. ``It's been
eight years. Something needs to be done.''
   Dioxin, an unwanted byproduct in the manufacture of other
chemicals, is suspected of causing disorders of the nervous system,
liver, kidneys and bladder. It also has been linked to cancer in
laboratory animals.
   Beth-ann Eichenser, an EPA spokeswoman, said the incinerator
plans were too far along to be threatened by last-minute opposition
from Nelson's Times Beach Environmental Task Force.
   Nelson said his group opposed the incinerator, to be built
alongside the Meramec River, because it would be vulnerable to
flooding and because of fears that the EPA might not dismantle it,
thus making Times Beach the nation's dioxin dump.
   ``We feel that once this incinerator gets here, it'll never
leave. There's no doubt in my mind that it'd be permanent,'' Nelson
said. ``Maybe they do need a permanent incinerator. But is St.
Louis County the place to put it? This makes no sense.''
   Nelson said he has received support from other municipalities
and residents. A rally is scheduled this month. Bills have been
introduced in the Legislature to prohibit the building of an
incinerator in a flood plain and within five miles of a school.
   Nelson's group wants the EPA to either bury the soil in a
permanent container or use a commercial incinerator that already
exists in Sauget, Ill., across the Mississippi River from St. Louis.
   Eichenser said work could begin as early as summer on the $118
million cleanup, which could take 10 years.
   ``I know that there are many residents in Eureka who say, `Well,
it's in our backyard.' But Times Beach is 400 acres of unpopulated
land. It's a viable, obvious location to do this project,''
Eichenser said.
   ``People view incinerators like Chernobyl,'' she said. ``They
think it's going to blow up and dirt will fly everywhere. This
would be safe.''
   The EPA said the so-called thermal treatment unit would
``roast'' the contaminated dirt, breaking the dioxin molecules into
carbon, oxygen, chlorine and hydrogen. Eichenser said the treated
soil would be 99.999 percent clean and could be turned back into
regular soil.
   Eichenser said the incinerator, which would process soil from
Times Beach and up to 27 other eastern Missouri sites, would be
surrounded by a levee to protect it from floodwaters.
   Flooding is a big part of Times Beach, which sprung up in the
1900s as a weekend retreat for St. Louis residents.
   The worst flood came at the end of 1982. Rain had fallen for
days, but many residents were caught by surprise and forced to flee
when the Meramec spilled it banks, reaching the second floor of
homes.
   Many residents never returned. Days later, the Centers for
Disease Control and the Missouri Divison of Health announced the
dioxin findings and recommended that the town be evacuated.
   The town officially ceased to exist when Times Beach's alderman
voted to disincorporate in 1985.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dial-a-porn services could transmit to adults
by telephone, with certain restrictions, under pending Federal
Communications Commission rules drawn to Supreme Court standards.
   The services would have to require credit card payments, issue
access codes, scramble their messages and ask telephone companies
to list 900 calls to their services on customers' bills.
   The FCC is seeking public comment by March 2 on the rules, which
the commission first adopted in 1987.
   Congress, concerned that the rules were not tough enough to
prevent enterprising youths from gaining access to the sex
messages, banned dial-a-porn services outright in April 1988 but
the Supreme Court overturned the ban, saying the statute could
apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene, not
merely indecent.
   The court said the technological safeguards proposed by the FCC
were enough to ensure that minors would not reach the dial-a-porn
services and, therefore, the government was left with no compelling
reason to ban such calls for adults.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug to Ease Symptoms of Reproductive Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
a new drug that relieves the symptoms of endometriosis, a disorder
of the reproductive tract that affects more than 4 million U.S.
women.
   The drug, Synarel, is the first drug of its class to be approved
for this condition. It will be marketed by Syntex Corp. The
approval announcement was made Wednesday.
   Synarel is administered as a nasal spray twice daily for six
months and works by stimulating and then suppressing production of
estrogen, which controls the growth of the endometrial tissue that
lines the uterus.
   Endometriosis occurs when this tissue, which usually is shed
monthly with menstruation, migrates outside the uterus, most often
into the abdominal and pelvic region, where it swells and bleeds
during menstruation.
   This tissue implants on the ovaries, the intestines and the
fallopian tubes, where it can cause blockage and infertility.
   Symptoms of endometriosis include severe menstrual cramps, pain
during sexual intercourse, painful urination and painful bowel
movements.

<DATELINE>MATAGALPA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega has
threatened to seize property owned by opposition leaders, including
the country's lone opposition newspaper, if his leftist Sandinista
party wins this month's elections.
   ``If we win, I say we will hand them a complete bill, so they
will be left without a newspaper _ La Prensa _ and the homes of the
candidate and the vice presidential candidate will be converted
into children's homes on the day after the elections,'' Ortega told
80,000 people at a campaign rally in Matagalpa, 75 miles north of
the capital, Managua.
   Also Wednesday, thousands of people turned out to hear his main
opponent, La Prensa publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, at two
rallies on the sparsely populated Atlantic Coast. The rallies in
Puerto Cabezas and Bluefields followed endorsements of her United
National Opposition by leaders of the Yatama Indians, who dominate
the region.
   Ortega's threat was in response to a recent speech by opposition
vice president Virgilio Godoy, who said if the 14-party opposition
coalition wins the Feb. 25 election, ``we are going to make the
Sandinistas pay the bills one by one'' for alleged violations of
human, civil and political rights.
   The Sandinista leader challenged the leaders of the U.S.-backed
opposition to repeat Godoy's words before international observers
monitoring the elections.
   Ortega repeated accusations he made Tuesday that the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels and opposition leaders were planning
to disrupt the campaign.
   After meeting with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Managua, Ortega told reporters late Tuesday
that about 2,000 rebels had infiltrated northern Nicaragua from
bases in neighborhing Honduras to disrupt the voting.
   Ortega also accused opposition leaders of planning to call the
elections fraudulent.
   ``Since they know they have already lost the elections, they
have this plan of saying there was fraud and the elections would be
invalid,'' Ortega said Wednesday. He also said the army was taking
action to neutralize any Contra infiltrators.
   About 1.7 million voters go to the polls Feb. 25 to choose a
president and vice president, a National Assembly, municipal
councils for 144 towns and two regional councils for the Atlantic
Coast.
   The United States cut off military aid to the Contras in
February 1988 but has continued to supply them with non-lethal aid
as a means of putting pressure on the Sandinistas so they stand by
their promise to conduct free elections.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Higher in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the yen today after a
three-day slide, while share prices surged on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 316.10 points, or 0.85
percent, closing at 37,471.99. It rose 48.86 points Wednesday.
   Dealers attributed today's rise to stability in the foreign
exchange and bond markets and newspaper poll reports that predicted
victory for the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday's
national elections.
   Investors had been wary about whether the pro-business party
could keep its control of the powerful lower house of Parliament
after losing its majority in the upper house in elections in July.
   ``Market players bought actively today, but I don't think it was
for real,'' said a dealer with Nikko Securities Co., adding,
``Volume is still very small.''
   An estimated 500 million shares changed hands on the first
section, up from 350 million the previous day.
   Other dealers said institutional investors remained on the
sidelines amid speculation of another discount rate increase after
the election. Following three increases last year in the rate
charged by the Bank of Japan for borrowings by commercial banks,
Japan's official discount rate now stands at 4.25 percent.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 144.45 yen, up 0.10
yen from Wednesday's 144.35-yen finish. It opened at 144.58 yen and
ranged between 144.42 yen and 144.75 yen.
   In the previous three trading days, the dollar had fallen a
total of 1.15 yen.
   The dollar opened higher today in Tokyo as market players
decided that little fallout from the bankruptcy filing of the
parent of U.S. securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert would hit
Japanese financial markets.
   But selling for profit-taking in the afternoon pushed it back
down, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan

   Six dockworkers' union locals sued for
racketeering by the federal government were likened to puppets
whose strings were pulled by the mob for more than 50 years.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court, says three
organized crime groups, including one allegedly led by John Gotti,
controlled the waterfront of New York and New Jersey.
   The puppet comparison was made the FBI, which called the
investigation ``Operation Marionette.''
   The lawsuit was brought under the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act to oust corrupt officials from the International
Longshoremen's Association.
   Organized crime has controlled the six ILA locals for decades
through murder, extortion, embezzlement of union funds and illegal
payoffs, according to the lawsuit, which also named 32 present and
former union officials, including the union's international
president, John Bowers.
   ``In response to this shocking pattern of criminality, ILA
officers have done virtually nothing,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Chad Vignola said in court papers.
   ILA spokesman Jim McNamara was unavailable for comment, his
office said.
   The 90,000-member ILA has been under a cloud for years due to
alleged mob domination. In 1953, it was expelled from the American
Federation of Labor for corruption.
   The lawsuit named the Gambino crime family and Gotti, its
reputed boss; the Genovese family and boss Anthony ``Fat Tony''
Salerno; and the Westies, a violent gang from Manhattan's West
Side, and Westies boss James Coonan.
   Salerno and Coonan are in prison.
   Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler, denied his client had anything
to do with waterfront corruption. ``They throw his name around just
to throw it around,'' Cutler said. ``It's a continuing vendetta.''
   Gotti, known as the ``Untouchable Don,'' was acquitted last week
for the third time in a criminal case.
   Instead of pursuing criminal charges, the government filed the
lawsuit in an attempt to remove from office ILA officers linked to
organized crime. It also seeks appointment of trustees to oversee
union elections and discipline ILA officials.
   The defendants also could be forced to pay back illegal profits.
   ``We're trying to take the ILA away from the mob and give it
back to the ILA rank and file,'' said James Fox, FBI agent in
charge of the New York office.
   According to the lawsuit, the Genovese family controlled the New
Jersey locals; the Gambino family controlled a local in Brooklyn;
and the Westies, through the influence of the Gambino family,
controlled the Manhattan locals.
   Leonard Newman, the executive director of the Waterfront
Commission of New York Harbor, said that despite numerous
convictions of ILA officials, the mob bosses were able to appoint
successors from jail.
   ``Out of office is not out of power,'' he said.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the lawsuit was
needed to attack corruption as ``a systemic problem.''
   The case is similar to one the federal government brought
against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters last year and a
failed lawsuit concerning alleged mob influence at at Manhattan's
Fulton Fish Market.
   The ILA suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Leonard B.
Sand, who will hold a hearing on the case Feb. 26.

   A high school's 22-year-old tradition of
a father-son banquet is getting a makeover _ mothers are now
welcome.
   The change came about after a quarterback at Mohawk Trail
Regional High School said he would boycott the event, which for
years was sponsored by the Friends of Mohawk Football, unless his
mother could attend.
   ``A lot of people supporting us through hard times were mothers,
but they couldn't come to our banquet,'' Quarterback Owa Brandstein
said. ``It was blatant discrimination and just plain wrong.''
   After Brandstein complained late last year, the banquet was
canceled. But a group of parents stepped in and arranged the new
event, scheduled for Saturday night with Boston College Coach Jack
Bicknell as speaker.
   ``In most cases, whole families _ mothers, fathers, sisters and
brothers _ are coming,'' said Stuart Eisenberg, Brandstein's
father. ``What we are trying to do is not be divisive, but
recognize that we are a football family. Even the coach's wife can
come.''

   Pun-lovers 341, killjoys 94.
   Voters faced with choosing between a time-honored slogan and
clean language have decided that this Livingston County village of
3,400 will once again greet motorists with signs that read ``Best
Town by a Damsite.''
   The village, 30 miles south of Rochester, had the slogan removed
from signs last summer after some residents complained that the pun
was distasteful. But after the new signs went up, other residents
said they missed the slogan and wanted it restored.
   In a vote Tuesday, slogan defenders defeated opponents who
wanted it removed by a count of 341-94.
   ``I think it belongs there,'' said resident Pat Crowley, who
voted to restore the slogan. ``It's been there for years and years
and years and years and what's wrong with saying `damn?' I say a
lot worse than that.''
   The nearby Mount Morris dam was completed in 1952 to control
flooding from the Genesee River.

   The challenge: How to save as many trees as
possible while clearing underbrush for a $13 million municipal
complex.
   The problem: Heavy machinery used to clear land often damages
root systems, which can kill trees.
   The solution: Betsy the mule.
   ``The mule doesn't make near the mess that a tractor does,''
said Wayne Mabry, the subcontractor responsible for clearing the
30-acre site.
   He borrowed Betsy from a Cherokee County sawmill where the
animal usually works to haul sled loads of underbrush from the
building site to a shredder at the edge of the property.
   ``I pondered on the thought of using manpower, but that would
have cost me a fortune,'' Mabry said. ``Being a country boy like I
am, I just decided to use a mule, because economics made it
feasible.''
   Renting a light tractor and buying fuel for it would have cost
about $2,000, Mabry said. Betsy works for $500 a month, and a
friend is providing room and board.

   Insurgents ambushed a train carrying
Mozambican miners and refugees home from South Africa, killing at
least 47 people and injuring more than 50, the national news agency
reported.
   The news agency, AIM, said the attack occurred late Wednesday
morning about 45 miles west of Maputo.
   A relief train brought the victims back to the capital, and
ambulances and trucks ferried the injured to a hospital, AIM said.
   Witnesses quoted by AIM said the attack began with the
detonation of a remote-controlled mine that knocked over two of the
passenger cars and derailed others. Guerrillas of the Mozambique
National Resistance then opened fire, looted the train and abducted
several survivors before withdrawing, AIM said.
   The rebels have been accused of several previous large-scale
massacres during their 13-year insurgency against the leftist
government.
   South Africa provided aid to the rebels for several years, but
has insisted that this assistance has stopped.

<HEAD>Two Satellites To Test Star Wars System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ground controllers readied two new
satellites for tests of a ``Star Wars'' plan to destroy ballistic
missiles with laser beams bouncing off orbiting mirrors.
   ``Both spacecraft are doing almost exactly what we expected them
to do,'' said Air Force Col. Tom Meyer, a project official, three
hours after the spacecraft were launched Wednesday by a Delta
rocket.
   Meyer said that after several days of checking out the satellite
systems, controllers will be ready for preliminary tests. Full
scale tests of both satellites should begin in a month or so.
   One satellite carried a mirror designed to reflect lasers fired
from a Hawaiian mountaintop back to a ground target to test the
accuracy of such a system.
   The other held sensors for measuring how successfully scientists
can correct distortions caused by dust, moisture and gases as the
laser beam shoots through the atmosphere.
   Meyer said the experiment was the most ambitious yet in the
Pentagon's program to develop a space-based shield against missiles.
   He emphasized the use of ground-based lasers, also called
directed energy, is just one part of the project. Also being
studied are space-based lasers and other weapons that would collide
with an enemy missile.
   A success in the current $313 million mission could help
preserve the $4.5 billion that President Bush is seeking for
research in budget year 1991 for the Strategic Defense Initiative,
or ``Star Wars.'' Some members of Congress want to cut that amount.
   In the missile-intercepting project called Relay Mirror
Experiment, two ground stations on Maui, Hawaii, will aim
low-powered laser beams simultaneously at the 2,300-pound satellite
orbiting 270 miles above Earth. The satellite holds a 24-inch
mirror designed to point a laser beam with an error of less than 57
millionths of a degree.
   The experiment will use the first two beams as signals to orient
its mirror. When an Air Force station atop Mount Haleakala aims
another beam at the satellite, the beam should reflect off the
mirror and strike a sensor target at the base of the mountain 12
miles away.
   The second satellite, called LACE for Low-Power Atmospheric
Compensation Experiment, will test a set of 210 laser-sensitive
sensors mounted on its side.
   The Mount Haleakala laser to be used on the 3,175-pound payload
has a special flexible mirror for distorting the laser beam on
Earth to compensate for atmospheric disturbances. The beam should
be sharp and powerful by the time it reaches LACE orbiting 340
miles high.
   LACE also carries an experiment to track the exhaust plumes of
rockets to determine which wavelengths are most useful in detecting
these plumes. Another experiment will measure neutron levels in
space to help scientists develop a means of distinguishing between
enemy warheads and decoys.

   The Minnesota Department of Health provides
bowls of condoms at pow wows with tribal medicine men to teach
Indians about AIDS.
   A computer software tax in Michigan brings in $4 million to $5
million a year for AIDS and public health education.
   In California, white cocktail napkins are printed with the
warning: ``Before you pick up a hot number, pick up a condom.''
   These were some of the creative touches being used by health
agencies around the country that were discussed at a Centers for
Disease Control-sponsored seminar on getting across the safe-sex
message.
   The four-day meeting ends today.
   Messages about a disease that is often transmitted sexually are,
of necessity, frequently graphic, state health officials said.
   A West Virginia health department poster shows photographs of
six rear ends clad in a variety of dress, from evening gown to a
pair of blue jeans. Above the photographs, the large black type
says, ``No ifs, ands or butts ...''
   Below, an admonition: ``Medical evidence PROVES that having anal
sex is the easiest way to infect your male or female partner with
the AIDS virus.''
   A health department poster from rainy Oregon shows a
good-looking man, apparently naked under a bright yellow slicker,
with the caption: ``Good boys always wear their rubbers.''
   Simple, explicit messages seem most effective, say state health
officials, although there isn't enough data available to know for
sure what works best.
   In Michigan, a well-financed educational program seems so far to
be working, said Jan Ruff, deputy chief for the Center for Health
Promotions in Lansing.
   ``Extensive evaluations indicate that 31 percent could identify
components of the AIDS campaign,'' she said.
   The department's television ads promote condom use and the use
of bleach to clean needles by intravenous drug users, a high-risk
group. The campaign includes slogans like, ``Are you a big enough
man to wear a condom?''
   ``It doesn't mince words,'' Ruff said. ``There are always people
who don't like it.''
   Minnesota's culturally sensitive work with American Indians is
entering its second year, so the success rate hasn't been
determined, said Roy Nelson, an information specialist with the
AIDS-Sexually Transmitted Diseases Services Section in Minneapolis.
   The department works with tribal medicine men and healers,
focusing on tradition and heritage.
   ``They have a certain way of saying things,'' he said. One theme
is ``Teaching our children well is the Indian way. Talk to them
about AIDS.''
   In Dallas, pocket-size packages containing a bright red condom,
instructions and an AIDS information telephone number are
distributed as safe-sex street kits.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   As of the end of January, the Atlanta-based CDC had recorded a
cumulative total of 117,781 cases of AIDS in the United States,
with 70,313 deaths.

   The non-Communist government, quadrupling
earlier estimates, now says nearly 10 percent of Poland's workers
will lose their jobs under the crash transformation from central
planning to capitalism.
   It also says prices rose nearly 79 percent in January, the first
month of the market-oriented reform program. It said the higher
prices, combined with smaller wage increases, produced a 43.3
percent drop in real earnings.
   The announcements Wednesday were the latest indications of the
mounting difficulties facing the Solidarity-led government in
trying to break with the damage wrought by four decades of
Communist rule and revive a moribund economy.
   There are frequent news reports of forced vacations as plants
suspend production, and the government anticipates that
unprofitable companies, kept functioning by Communist government
subsidies, will close.
   The previous forecast of 400,000 jobless was raised
substantially Wednesday by Labor Minister Jacek Kuron in a report
to a parliamentary committee, the official PAP news agency said.
   However, PAP said the new estimate of 1.7 million unemployed,
based on a World Bank assessment, includes a large group of
employees old enough to get pensions and farmers also working in
industry.
   The total workforce is about 18 million of Poland's 37 million
people.
   Last week, there were about 55,000 unemployed, the report said.
   The pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said Wednesday that
a survey of 500 enterprises in an industrial region of southern
Poland found 25,000 workers were expected to be dismissed in the
first half of 1990.
   The newspaper said the largest layoffs were planned in the
mining industry, and that several mines were considering bankruptcy.
   The new economic policies that went into effect Jan. 1 force
government-run enterprises to become self-sufficient while
absorbing huge increases in the prices of gas, electricity and
other costs no longer kept artificially low by subsidies.
   The price of food increased 79 percent and non-food articles by
72 percent during January, the statistics office said.
   A 149 percent increase in the price of services stemmed from
higher rents and increased charges for heat, electricity,
transportation and telecommunications, the report said.
   The statistics office of the 5-month-old Solidarity-led
government reported some leveling of prices, and even decreases,
were noted toward month's end as the drive continued to turn the
centrally controlled socialist economy into a market-driven system.
   Higher prices have forced down demand, which is causing a drop
in production.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has asked for the freezing of
the Polish debt to the governments informally represented by the
Paris Club, which totals about $30 billion of the nearly $40
billion owed to the West.
   Mazowiecki, who in August became the first non-Communist to head
an East bloc government, said the foreign debt burden is the most
critical factor in Poland's effort to emerge from economic crisis.

<TEXT>
   Coretta Scott King urged a peaceful dismantling
of apartheid. But an African National Congress leader at her side
warned of a struggle that would make the French Revolution look
like a ``children's picnic'' if negotiations with the South African
government fail.
   The comments came during a torch-lighting ceremony Wednesday at
the crypt of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., in
celebration of the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela.
   ``I hope and pray that the anti-apartheid movement in South
Africa will be able to adhere to the non-violent strategy that has
begun to produce the historic reforms we have witnessed in recent
months,'' Mrs. King said.
   ``If the South African people cannot come together, I'm afraid
to think of what is going to happen. The French Revolution would
look like a children's picnic,'' said ANC member Sifiso Makhathini.
   Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 along with
seven of his ANC colleagues for their role in a conspiracy to
overthrow the minority white government by force. Despite the
promise of negotiations with the government, Mandela continues to
support the ANC's ``armed struggle.''
   Asked how the ANC has managed to maintain Mrs. King's support in
light of her fierce opposition to the use of violence, Makhathini
said: ``They understand our history. They understand why we had to
take up arms. They know for decades and decades we were involved in
a non-violent struggle.''
   The activists, however, were in unanimous agreement that
stronger, stiffer sanctions should be enacted until the South
African government lifts the 3-year-old state of emergency and
releases all political prisoners unconditionally.

<HEAD>U.S. Delegation: Leads Must Be Pursued in Jesuit Slaying</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. congressional commission
contends the Salvadoran government has not yet fully investigated
``important leads and allegations'' in the November massacre of six
Jesuit priests.
   Rep. Joe Moakley, D.-Mass, commended President Alfredo
Cristiani's government for ``good police work'' in the technical
aspects of the investigation.
   But the commission led by Moakley said Wednesday that doubts
remain as to whether the people who planned the slayings have been
identified, even though a Salvadoran army colonel has been arrested.
   It also said some members of the armed forces may have conspired
to protect others implicated in the killings.
   ``The investigation is not over and important leads and
allegations remain to be fully investigated,'' said a three-page
statement read by Moakley at a news conference. The 14-person
delegation was on a four-day visit to El Salvador to evaluate the
government's investigation of the Jesuit killings.
   Before dawn on Nov. 16, five days after leftist rebels launched
their biggest offensive of the 10-year-old civil war, a contingent
of 30 soldiers from the elite U.S.-trained Atlacatl infantry
battalion raided the campus of the Jesuit-run Central American
University.
   The soldiers awakened the rector, Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, the
vice-rector, Rev. Ignacio Martin-Baro and four other
priest-professors, as well as the domestic servant and her
15-year-old daughter. Five of the six priests were taken to the
yard behind their residence, ordered to lay face-down and shot in
the head, according to accounts from witnesses and court documents.
   The sixth priest was killed inside, as were the housekeeper and
her daughter.
   An army colonel, three lieutenants and five soldiers have been
charged with murder in the case. Col. Guillermo Benavides, one of
the accused, became the highest-ranking Salvadoran soldier indicted
on a human rights-related charge.
   The Salvadoran Roman Catholic hierarchy and the Society of Jesus
have expressed concern that Benavides may be a scapegoat for other
high-ranking officers who might have been involved.
   In El Salvador, Jesuit intellectuals have for years been
considered subversives by the far right.
   Moakley said that a central question is ``whether the human
rights problems in El Salvador, including the Jesuit killings, are
the actions of a few renegade military figures or whether they stem
from attitudes and actions that go to the very heart of the armed
forces and other major institutions in this country.''
   ``Encouraging genuine change in these institutions remains the
greatest challenge facing El Salvador: a challenge that despite
enormous investments of money and effort, has not yet been fully
met,'' the U.S. official said.
   The United States has provided more than $4 billion in economic
and military aid to El Salvador in the past decade.
   Several senators have proposed legislation that would condition
further aid on improvement of the government's human rights record
and progress toward a negotiated peace.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told
South Korean officials the Pentagon wants to slash its forces in
Asia by 10 percent to 12 percent _ at least 12,000 troops _ over
the next three years, U.S. officials said today.
   Cheney said some 5,000 of the troops would be pulled out of
South Korea, with an additional 7,000 to 9,400 being withdrawn from
the Philippines and Japan, officials said. There are 120,000 U.S.
troops based in the three nations.
   ``We aren't going to move precipitously ... our commitment
remains strong,'' Cheney said at a news conference. ``The threat
remains undiminished.''
   Cheney is on a two-week tour of Asian nations that hosting U.S.
forces _ South Korea, Japan and the Philippines _ to respond to
congressional demands for a reassessment of the U.S. military role
in the Pacific.
   He met today with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and Defense
MInister Lee Sang-hoon to discuss U.S. troop cutbacks and increased
burden sharing for the upkeep of U.S. forces based in South Korea.
   Lee, speaking at the same press conference, said his country had
``accepted in principal the gradual cutback in troop strength'' of
the non-combatant U.S. forces. He pledged to work with U.S.
military officials to work out the precise numbers and details of
the drawdown.
   Cheney also said progress was made in the talks on the issue of
turning command of the joint U.S.-Korea military structure over to
a South Korean general. Operational control of the majority of
South Korea's 600,000 forces now is under the senior U.S.
commander, a four-star general.
   ``We talked about the U.S. playing more of a supportive role as
the R.O.K. (South Korea) takes the lead,'' Cheney said.
   The Korean minister, asked about a possible withdrawal of 5,000
U.S. troops, said the exact numbers would be determined by the
military commanders of both nations.
   The minister also pledged to give ``positive consideration'' to
increasing payments for sharing costs for the U.S. forces in Korea.
   Cheney did not personally refer to the 10 percent to 12 percent
U.S. troop reduction in Asia that was given earlier by U.S.
officials, but noted that the Republic of Korea was only one of
several nations being asked to increase its contributions,
primarily due to congressional pressure.
   ``Korea has by no means been singled out in this process,''
Cheney said.
   Cheney wants Seoul to nearly double its $300 million annual
contribution to support the 45,000 American troops over the next
three years, officials said.
   Prior to the news conference, an American official familiar with
the discussions said the Koreans ``reacted with horror'' to the
suggestion of a U.S. troop reduction.
   ``Mr. Cheney is laying out what we would like to see done,''
said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified by name. ``We're laying out goals. It's the first step
in consultations with the Korean government to see what we'd like
to have happen.''
   He said the Koreans were horrified at first because they believe
any cutback in American soldiers would be the first step in a total
U.S. troop withdrawal and ``the American security blanket is gone.''
   Cheney is telling the Koreans that Congress would make sharper
cuts if South Korea does not assume a greater role in its own
defense. Some lawmakers have suggested dropping the U.S. troop
level to 10,000 men and women.
   The Seoul government has balked at suggestions that it pay more
for such things as libraries, theaters and pool halls to make life
easier for U.S. troops because they provide none of those things
for their own 680,000 military personnel, the official said.
   U.S. lawmakers are unhappy that the United States spends around
$2.4 billion a year on U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula while
South Korea enjoys a trade surplus with the United States.
   The official in the Cheney party said he expected the Koreans to
raise their contribution by about $30 million this year, but that
U.S. officials hoped to put the Korean government on a path for a
``substantial increase'' over the coming years.
   The official said he wouldn't argue with reports that estimate
the United States will call for the Koreans to increase their $300
million contribution to nearly $700 million by 1993.
   By South Korean estimates, Seoul contributes nearly $2 billion
annually to the U.S. forces in South Korea; the Pentagon places its
contribution at around $300 million.
   The Koreans count such things as rent-free use of land for
military installations.

<HEAD>Newly Restored Superintendent Dismisses 86 High School Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the first acts of a school
superintendent reinstated after his suspension sparked racial
protests was to suspend 86 high school students for chanting civil
rights slogans in a school cafeteria.
   Norward Roussell, the superintendent, also said Wednesday he
would file a lawsuit against the white majority school board that
voted not to renew his contract in December.
   Roussell, who is black, said the lawsuit would allege racial
discrimination.
   Most of the black students who were suspended had taken part in
disruptive protests outside Selma High School on Tuesday, when all
11 public schools reopened for the first time since they began
closing Feb. 6, Roussell said.
   He was restored as superintendent that day. His dismissal a week
earlier led to protests, but his restoration failed to immediately
end the turmoil, as the student protesters called for a renewal of
his three-year contract, which ends in June.
   James Carter, an aide to Roussell, said attendance was 92
percent for the school system Wednesday. About 23 percent missed
classes when they resumed Tuesday.
   Students passed through a metal detector at Selma High, where
National Guardsmen, state troopers and Selma police provided
security and school officials worked to bring school operations
back to normal.
   Roussell said expulsions may be in store for some of the
students who began chanting during the first lunch period and
continued in the second period with a slogan they had used marching
to school Tuesday.
   ``The only way we're going to solve our problem in Selma is to
cut the rotten core out of the apple,'' city attorney Henry Pitts
said of the suspensions.
   Officials said 143 students, about 2 percent of the
6,000-student public school system, have withdrawn since classes
resumed Tuesday. The city is 52 percent black and its public school
system is about 70 percent black.

   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner urged advertisers to
take the high road in considering programs to sponsor, and accused
the three largest networks of being more concerned with audience
size than program quality.
   ``They don't take the high ground,'' said Turner, who operates
four cable networks, including CNN. ``They take the low.'' He
offered no examples of shows that would illustrate his accusation.
   Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System,
spoke Wednesday at a workshop of the National Association of
Advertisers.
   He urged the advertising community ``to take the high road and
to take the long-term outlook'' in shows they sponsor.
   Turner was ambivalent when asked how advertisers should respond
to viewer boycott calls.
   ``I'm not asking anybody to stand up to a boycott threat _
unless you want to,'' he said. ``That's everybody's individual
choice. I'm easy on it.''
   Turner said he could recall only one occasion when ads were
pulled from his programs.
   All 10 advertisers withdrew last summer from ``Rage Over
Trees,'' an Audubon Society special criticized by loggers and the
logging industry that was broadcast on TBS network.
   ``I really didn't feel too bad about it,'' he said.
   The show lost about $800,000 in advertising revenue because of
pressure from northwest loggers, a TBS spokesman said.
   Turner, who in 1985 tried to buy CBS, said he has been holding
``wide-ranging'' talks with that network about possible ventures in
news and sports projects, including joint newsgathering by CNN and
CBS News.
   Warren Littlefield, NBC's executive vice president for prime
time program, later made a jab at cable television in a separate
panel discussion.
   Littlefield _ who wasn'ex and violence.
   He proposed one solution for families with young children. ``If
you're a concerned parent, yank the cable out,'' Littlefield said.

<TEXT>
   The long-distance courtship of Toby the
robot by an infatuated doll named Jodi ended just before
Valentine's Day when Toby learned that Jodi had gone to the big
dollhouse in the sky.
   Toby's owner, Jim Barclay, a printer and handyman at a medical
clinic, said the last of a string of cards and letters arrived
Monday with the bad news that Jodi died in a head-on collision on
the way from Royal Oak, Mich., to the North Pole.
   ``I had tears in my eyes when I started reading that letter,''
Barclay said Wednesday. His wife, Margene, ``started crying, too,''
he said.
   Toby seemed to lose his juice.
   ``He is just standing over there with a blank stare on his face
with his black arm band on,'' Barclay said of the battery-powered,
18-inch-tall robot.
   Of the practical jokers behind the correspondence _ Mrs. Barclay
swears it isn't her _ Barclay said: ``Maybe now, somebody will come
forward.''
   The romance began when Barclay came to work one morning before
Christmas 1988 and found the gold-toned robot propped in his chair.
The note attached to Toby said he was a gift from Santa.
   Soon after, Jodi began sending Toby cards and letters,
expressing her longing for the time they would be reunited at
Santa's workshop.
   The missives arrived about once a month from across the country.
With each card, the Barclays and the 50 other employees at the
clinic became more curious about the identity of Jodi and of the
architect of the elaborate scheme.
   Interest hit a peak when the Barclays received a hefty ham this
past Christmas from Jodi and Toby. No one could figure out how the
lovebirds got the gift into Barclay's locked car.
   No one expected the romance to come to such a sad ending.
   ``I thought we would come in here someday and Toby would be gone
and then we would get pictures of them on the beach at Waikiki
wearing bikinis and grass skirts,'' Barclay said.
   While Jodi's death has brought an end to the romance, it
answered a few questions that had nagged at the Barclays.
   They had assumed that Jodi was a robot like Toby, but the death
notice included photographs that revealed her to be a red-haired,
bespectacled Cabbage Patch doll. She posed with the nutty
television alien ALF, her Cabbage Patch sister, Lori, a stuffed
pony, Corky, and a stuffed dog named Porky.
   The photos and letter were all sent by ``Jackie,'' described as
a friend of Jodi.
   Barclay dismissed bets by his co-workers at a medical clinic
that the correspondent would convince Cabbage Patch sister Lori to
pick up the romance where Jodi left it.
   Jodi's death means ``they are trying to bring it to an end,''
Barclay said.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Higher in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed slightly against most major
foreign currencies in early European trading today. Gold prices
also rose.
   Currency dealers in Milan, Italy, said investors were closing
positions and watching for the outcome of the West German
Bundesbank's policy-making Central Bank Council meeting later in
the day.
   While most analysts don't expect the central bank to raise West
German interest rates today, a cautious outlook has slowed activity
and put pressure on the mark, they said.
   ``Things are very calm right now, people are just twiddling
their thumbs and watching the Bundesbank,'' one trader said.
   Analysts said the dollar was also benefiting from expectations
that Friday's U.S. trade figures will show an improvement in the
trade gap.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.10 yen to a closing 144.45 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 144.50 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6778 West German marks, up from 1.6715
   _1.4940 Swiss francs, up from 1.4920
   _5.7055 French francs, up from 5.6845
   _1.8907 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8832
   _1,246.25 Italian lire, up from 1,242.25
   _1.2055 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2062
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6948, compared with $1.6963 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $416.90 a troy ounce, up
from $416.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $417.05.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $416.80, up from $415.52 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$415.33.
   Bullion dealers attributed gold's movement to speculative play
rather than any fresh fundamental or market-affecting news. They
said the metal was being supported by economic and political
turmoil, particularly in South Africa and Germany.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.35 a troy ounce, from
Wednesday's $5.32.

<HEAD>Gov't to Lift Some Emergency Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided to
partially lift emergency regulations, including a law that allows
security forces to dispose of bodies without inquest, a senior
minister said today.
   The announcement came hours after Amnesty International harshly
criticized the restrictions and said thousands of people had
disappeared or were murdered by the government forces and death
squads last year.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters six emergency
regulations imposed in June would be repealed at midnight. They
involve restrictions on publications, political parties and travel
on rail and public tranport.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa assured rival politicians on
Wednesday that he would revoke some of the emergency rules imposed
to try to quell a 2-year-old uprising by ultranationalist Sinhalese
extremists.
   More than 6,000 people have been killed in the fighting in south
and central Sri Lanka.
   A separatist rebellion by minority Tamils in the north and east
has cost 11,000 lives since 1983. Sinhalese militants began
attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government when it tried to make
peace with the Tamil rebels, contending it was making too many
concessions.
   The emergency regulations, which need the approval of Parliament
each month, give broad powers to security forces to search, arrest
or detain suspects for indefinite periods.
   Amnesty International said reports of killings increased sharply
after emergency regulations were introduced.
   In a report released today, the London-based human rights group
said also said Indian peacekeeping troops in Sri Lanka were
``reported to have committed extrajudicial executions and there
were numerous allegations of torture of prisoners by members of the
(Indian force).''
   Sri Lankan and Indian officials had no direct comment on the
report.
   Indian soldiers arrived in Sri Lanka 2{ years ago to supervise
an arms surrender by Tamil separatists under a pact signed in July
1987.
   Most groups gave up their weapons, but the dominant Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam reneged on the peace plan.
   The Indian troops, who were supposed to maintain law and order
in the strife-torn northern and eastern provinces, instead fought
the Tamil Tigers. At least 1,100 soldiers died in the fighting.
   The presence of the Indian troops and the peace accord sparked a
Sinhalese backlash. Indian forces started leaving Sri Lanka last
year and the last troops are to be gone by March 31.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of the population.

   The Air Force said the launch occurred at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday.
The payload was propelled 4,100 miles down the Western Test Range
toward the Marshall Islands.
   The launch was the first of a program to test the payload
component called the missile's Maneuvering System Technology, said
Capt. Tom DeSantis, an Air Force spokesman.
   The payload was aboard a Minuteman I booster, a three-stage
solid propellant ballistic missile that has been refurbished to

   Spiky-haired rock star Billy Idol underwent a
fourth operation for leg injuries suffered in a motorcycle crash,
his publicist said.
   The rocker, whose hard-driving hits ``White Wedding'' and
``Rebel Yell'' made him a star, was listed in fair condition.
   Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center performed skin grafts on
the singer's right leg, which suffered a compound fracture Feb. 6
when his Harley-Davidson hit a car. Doctors also worked to repair
muscle damage suffered in the accident.
   ``He is out of recovery and back in his own room,'' Idol's
publicist, Ellen Golden, said Wednesday afternoon.
   Police say Idol, 34, ran a stop sign and sideswiped a car while
driving home from a Hollywood recording studio where he had
completed work on a new album.

<HEAD>Kohl: Elections Key to Unification; No NATO Troops on East German
Soil</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-West Germany, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl told Parliament
today that unification will begin to take shape quickly after East
Germany's elections, and that no NATO troops should be stationed on
what is now East German soil.
   It was one of the stormiest parliamentary sessions in recent
memory, with Kohl accusing his political opponents of being too
close to the disgraced East Germany Communist Party in years past.
   The opposition Social Democrats responded with hoots and
shouting, and Parliament's president, Rita Suessmuth, harshly
admonished the lawmakers.
   West Germany is to hold national elections in December and the
Social Democrats decisively defeated Kohl's party in recent state
elections. The rival parties are also vying to win support among
the East German electorate.
   Kohl laid out to Parliament the results of his talks over the
weekend with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and on Tuesday
and Wednesday with Hans Modrow, East Germany's Communist premier.
   ``Never before since the division of our land ... have we been
so close to our goal _ the unity of all Germans in freedom _ as we
are today,'' Kohl told Parliament.
   He said he and Gorbachev had agreed on the singular importance
of East Germany's March 18 elections:
   ``I was able to underscore my firm belief that the result of the
elections will not only be a democratic and negotiations-capable
government, but also a government program with the clear goal:
`Unity as soon as possible.'''
   Kohl vowed that the security concerns of ``neighboring states''
will not be ignored on the road to German unification. He
reiterated his position that a united Germany must be a NATO member
and not demilitarized, and that Germany will remain committed to
European integration.
   ``The history of this century shows nothing is more detrimental
to European stability than a Germany that swings between two
worlds, between East and West,'' said Kohl, referring to World War
II.
   ``The imperative stability factor needed in the middle of Europe
is a free and democratic Germany as part of a secure alliance, and
a growing political and economic integretation within the European
Community,'' said Kohl.
   The chancellor seemed to be addressing concerns among many
Europeans that a united Germany could derail attempts to create
closer European unity, or seek to reclaim land ceded to Poland
after World War II.
   Kohl also said he favors keeping any NATO troops off the
territory of what is now East Germany.
   The Soviet Union has insisted that a united Germany be neutral,
a demand rejected by the United States and its alliance partners.
   Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the West German foreign minister, has
proposed that as a compromise NATO troops not be allowed on what is
now East German turf.
   Kohl's address was interrupted several times as he condemned the
Social Democrats for having close contacts with East Germany's
Communists during years past.
   ``You were allied with these people,'' said Kohl.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the Social Democrats, fired back by
reminding Kohl that his Christian Democrats are now supporting the
East German Christian Democrats, who for years were allied with the
Communists.
   ``Mister Chanceller, whoever supports the East CDU _ which for
40 years went along with everything (the Communists said) _ has no
right to point the finger at the Social Democrats,'' said Vogel.

   Precipitation in the form of snow, sleet, freezing rain and
thundershowers fell today in the Northwest and from the Plains and
northern Great Lakes into New England and New York state.
   A major storm system moved northeast out of the southern Rockies
and across the central Plains. The storm has already combined with
an Arctic cold front to leave snow from Arizona to Michigan,
including 3 inches in Flagstaff, Ariz., 6 inches in Beaver, Utah, 9
inches in Chicago and 5 in Battle Creek, Mich.
   Blizzard conditions were expected tonight in Minnesota. A band
of sleet and freezing rain 100 miles wide formed below the belt of
heavy snow.
   A windy snowstorm slapped northern Illinois with up to 10 inches
of snow Wednesday, closing O'Hare International Airport and
clogging traffic in Chicago. United Airlines, O'Hare's largest
carrier, cancelled more than one-third of its 800 flights Wednesday
because of the weather.
   Cold air behind the storm has filtered south across California
to the San Diego area. Frost and freeze warnings were posted for
the San Diego area this morning, and temperatures were expected in
the low to mid 20s.
   Showers and thunderstorms soaked areas from Texas to southern
New England. Warm air clashing with an Arctic air mass spawned
freezing rain across much of northern Indiana, northern Ohio, and
southern lower Michigan.
   Afternoon thunderstorms may develop today in parts of Missouri
and Illinois.
   A new Pacific storm system spread more snow into Washington and
Oregon. Locally heavy snowfall was expected across the western
parts of both states today. Winter weather watches for snow were
issued for Northern California and Nevada for snow tonight and
Friday.
   On Valentine's Day, rare hail and snow fell in Los Angeles and
San Diego, though the evidence melted soon after landing.
   The Southeast looked for highs today in the 80s and scattered
showers.
   New Orleans received 2.59 inches of rain in 6 hours Wednesday
afternoon.
   Several high temperature records were set on Valentine's Day on
the East Coast, including Warwick, R.I., 60; New York City, 62;
Beckley, W.Va., 63; Wilmington, Del., 67; Baltimore, Md., 70

<HEAD>House-to-House Fighting Reported in Massawa, Port Damaged</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House-to-house fighting was
reported today between Eritrean rebels and government troops
battling for control of the Red Sea port of Massawa.
   The state-run Ethiopian News Agency called the fighting
``ferocious'' and said both sides had suffered heavy casualties
since the Eritrean People's Liberation Front last week launched its
first offensive in more than a year.
   The agency gave no casualty figures for combatants or civilians,
but the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission, a government agency,
said the fighting had created ``a dangerous situation with a likely
massive loss of life'' in the northern provinces of Eritrea and
Tigre.
   Massawa, Ethiopia's main port, is the gateway for all goods
going to the two provinces. Hundreds of thousands of tons of
emergency relief food pass through it annually to feed people
threatened by famine caused by drought and aggravated by civil war.
   The United Nations hoped to ship 1.1 million tons of emergency
food through Massawa in the next few months to feed an estimated 4
million people, mainly in Eritrea and Tigre.
   The Eritrean rebels claimed capture of the port in a radio
broadcast Saturday, but a government official in Addis Ababa said
the rebels controlled only parts of the town.
   The news agency reported heavy shelling of Massawa by sea and
land, apparently by both sides. It said the shelling had damaged
many buildings and the port, where relief food is stored.
   The rebels claim to have sunk or captured 12 warships. If the
claims are true, that would be more than half of the Ethiopian
fleet of two frigates and 21 patrol boats listed by the
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government has
repeatedly accused unidentified Arab nations of turning the Red Sea
into a Moslem sea, inferring that they have been arming the rebels
with naval craft.
   Delivery of relief food from Massawa to the interior was halted
after the Eritrean secessionists began their offensive on Feb. 8,
officials say.
   The Relief and Rehabilitation Commission says 90,000 tons of
relief food are stranded in Massawa.
   The rebel offensive has virtually cut the provincial capital of
Asmara from the national capital in Addis Ababa, except by air.
   The Tigre People's Liberation Front, another rebel group, cut
the Asmara-Addis Ababa road when it took control of Tigre province,
Eritrea's southern neighbor, early last year.
   The two rebel groups claim to have killed at least 2,500
government troops since the Eritrean offensive began.
   The Eritreans took up arms in 1962 to press for independence of
their former Italian colony. Late last year, rebel and government
emissaries held two unsuccessful rounds of peace talks mediated by
former President Jimmy Carter in Nairobi, Kenya, and Atlanta.
   The Tigrean rebels, fighting since 1975, controls the province
Tigre and seek Mengistu's ouster.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge who declared a mistrial in
the first international drug prosecution brought jointly by Chinese
and U.S. officials says the case proves ``you can't meld'' the two
legal systems.
   U.S. District Judge William Orrick halted proceedings Wednesday
in the case against three men, accused in connection with $700,000
worth of heroin found inside dead goldfish, after a key prosecution
witness said he had lied under pressure and death threats from
Chinese officials.
   The witness, who is seeking asylum in the United States,
recanted his testimony and said he had been tortured in a Shanghai
prison.
   Orrick said the breakdown of the trial was ``proof positive you
can't meld the legal system in the People's Republic of China with
the legal system in the United States.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Swenson told reporters Orrick's
conclusion was valid for this case, but ``I'm still confident that
this type of problem does not have to affect future cases. ...The
legal system in China is almost identical to many of the western
European systems.''
   No decision has been made on a retrial, Swenson said.
   Federal drug agents charged that seven pounds of Southeast Asian
heroin had been put inside condoms that were sewed into the bodies
of goldfish and mixed into shipments of live goldfish from China to
the United States. Three men arrested in San Francisco, Leung
Tak-Lun, Chico Wong and Andrew Wong, were charged with possessing
heroin with intent to distribute.
   The witness, Wang Zong-Xiao, was arrested in Shanghai in March
1988 and held there for most of the time until last December, when
he was brought to San Francisco. He testified Feb. 1 that he took
part in the heroin shipment along with Leung.
   But Wang filed for asylum four days later, saying he had been
threatened with death by officials from Shanghai who had
accompanied him to the United States.
   He said in court papers that he had been coerced into confessing
and warned by the Chinese officials not to reveal the coercion or
the later beatings and electric shocks he received, nor to disclose
that students and workers were held and tortured in the Shanghai
prison.
   Wang returned to the witness stand Tuesday, without the jury
present, to describe his torture in China. He said he had lied in
testimony that implicated Leung.
   Orrick said Wednesday he was declaring a mistrial because of the
allegations of perjured testimony, and because the Chinese
government had not provided defense lawyers before the trial with
Wang's earlier statements, as the judge's order required.
   After those actions, any conviction in the case would surely be
reversed on appeal, he told the jury.
   Orrick also noted that two Shanghai officers who accompanied
Wang to San Francisco returned suddenly to China on Sunday after
the judge issued an order last week prohibiting U.S. officials from
returning Wang to China while his asylum application is pending.
   The officers had been accused of threatening Wang if he changed
his testimony.
   ``I don't think you'll be seeing them again,'' Orrick said.
   Cedric Chao, a lawyer appointed to represent Wang, said the case
for asylum is strong, and described Wang as ``at peace with
himself'' after his latest testimony.
   ``It would be unconscionable to send him back to China to face
certain death,'' Chao told reporters.

<HEAD>President Finds Pace of European Changes `Mind-Boggling'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The speed of change in Eastern Europe is
``mind-boggling'' and raises concern about continued stability in
the region, President Bush said in an interview published today.
   ``I never thought you'd see this rapid a change,'' Bush told USA
Today.
   One example, he added, was that ``two weeks ago, the Soviets
said they had a problem with our proposals (on troop reductions in
Europe). Less than a week later, it's accepted.''
   Despite the fast-moving pace of change, Bush said his concerns
about continued stability do not have him in a ``sleepless mode.''
   ``There's sometime when you wonder, `Is this going to be brought
to conclusion,' or `What's going to happen in terms of stability as
the change takes place in Eastern Europe,''' he said.
   ``There's worries, but not in the sense of a crisis
environment.''
   He said it is ``good'' that political reform is evolving within
the Soviet Union and ``no reason to lose sleep ... because our
thesis that democracy and freedom should be contagious is proving
to be correct. And I hope it proves to be correct in South Africa.''
   The president said he would not attempt to oust Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega, as he did Manuel Antonio Noriega in
Panama, even if he concludes that the leftist leader has stolen the
upcoming elections in Nicaragua.
   ``No,'' he relied in response to a question. ``There's a lot of
non-elected leaders around the world that can sleep comfortable.''
   Pressed on that point, Bush called the line of questioning ``too
hypothetical, but the answer is no. If you're talking about an
effort to protect American life or something, the signal should be
loud and clear: I'll do what's necessary to protect American lives.
But if you're saying I don't like the results of an election and
will be use military force, the answer is no.''

<HEAD>Charges Dropped Against Joyce Ann Brown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROD RICHARDSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The district attorney's office said it would drop
attempts to retry a woman whose conviction was overturned after she
spent nine years in prison for a 1980 fur store robbery in which
the owner was killed.
   Joyce Ann Brown said the decision Wednesday by the Dallas County
office was the ``best Valentine's Day gift in the world.''
   ``I really held my breath up until the last moment,'' Ms. Brown
said after state District Judge Ron Chapman accepted the
prosecutors' decision.
   Ms. Brown, 43, was sentenced to life in prison by Chapman in
October 1980 for aggravated robbery five months earlier that ended
in the death of Ruben Danziger.
   After her conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals in November, prosecutors said they would try Ms.
Brown again.
   But prosecutor George West said Wednesday there was
``insufficient evidence to proceed to trial,'' although the case
would remain open.
   West said the decision ``is one in which someone is going to be
pleased, someone is going to be upset, and there was no way out for
me. I'm going to have to face both of those.''
   He declined to give specific reasons for dropping the charges.
   Despite the lack of physical evidence linking Ms. Brown to the
crime, she was found guilty of being an accomplice largely because
of the testimony of two prosecution witnesses, including Danziger's
wife, Ala.
   Mrs. Danziger's attorney, David Vaughan, said justice was not
been served and that Ms. Brown was guilty.
   Ms. Brown said of Mrs. Danziger, ``I have to live with the fact
that she will probably go to her grave thinking they released a
guilty person and they didn't.''
   Ms. Brown was the third Texas inmate in a year to have a
conviction overturned amid national attention. Clarence Brandley, a
former janitor who was six days away from execution after nine
years on death row, had his conviction reversed in December. The
capital murder conviction of Randall Dale Adams, whose case was the
subject of the movie ``The Thin Blue Line,'' also was dropped after
he spent 12 years in prison.

<HEAD>Trump Met Actress Marla Maples at Church</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MONROE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Marla Maples, described as the other
woman in the Donald Trump divorce saga, met the billionaire real
estate developer at a venerable New York church.
   Trump and Ms. Maples sat together at Sunday services ``fairly
regularly,'' a source told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Trump
married his wife, Ivana, at the Marble Collegiate Church, but she
did not attend services with him.
   ``She is the reason the marriage broke up,'' New York Daily News
columnist Liz Smith told Larry King, who devoted a half-hour
Wednesday night to Trump vs. Trump on his Cable News Network talk
show.
   But rival New York Post columnist Cindy Adams told WABC-TV News
that Ms. Maples is nothing more than ``this week's toy'' for Trump.
   According to a prenuptial agreement made known Sunday, Mrs.
Trump gets custody of their three kids, a mansion in Connecticut
and $25 million _ less than 2 percent of Trump's estimated $1.7
billion fortune.
   Despite statements to the contrary, Trump reportedly expects to
settle for four times the agreement.
   ``He's going to pay $100 million'' for a fast settlement, a
Trump aide was quoted anonymously as saying in today's New York
Newsday.
   Smith, who broke the story Sunday, agreed, telling King: ``I
think Donald is negotiating right now probably to make Ivana an
offer a lot bigger than this $25 million settlement.''
   Mrs. Trump's lawyer says she deserves more. But Trump said in an
interview published today in The Washington Post, ``This prenuptial
agreement was signed by a sophisticated woman. They're virtually
impossible to break. They're sealed in gold.''
   Ivana Trump would not comment when confronted by a horde of
reporters Wednesday at her 41st birthday party.
   Several women shouted ``Get the money, Ivana'' and others
cheered as the fur-clad blonde alighted from her black Mercedes at
an expensive Manhattan restaurant.
   Reports indicated Ms. Maples, an actress who has had bit
television parts and a bikini-clad airline advertisement pinup, is
ready to marry Trump.
   About 14 months ago, Trump sought counseling from Dr. Arthur
Caliandro, the minister of the church, about whether to continue
his relationship with Ms. Maples, according to the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Caliandro was at a board meeting on Wednesday and did not
immediately return a phone call.
   Lisa Tolf, a church administrator, confirmed that Ms. Maples in
May 1987 joined the church, which is part of the Reformed Church of
America. Ms. Tolf said she doesn't know if Trump attends services
regularly but said of Ms. Maples: ``I've seen her at the church.''
   Asked whether Trump had sought counseling at the church, she
replied, ``I'm not the person to talk to about that.''
   There also were reports that Trump paid for a room for Ms.
Maples at the St. Moritz hotel, which he once owned. Not true, said
Ms. Maples' agent, Chuck Jones.
   ``She was just offered $250,000 by the National Enquirer to tell
her story but since there's no story to tell, she turned them
down,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Society photographer Norman Parkinson, who
specialized in photographing women and won fame for his pictures of
British royals, died today in Singapore at age 76, his family
reported.
   Parkinson collapsed on Feb. 2 with a brain hemorrhage in his
hotel room in Sabah, Malaysia. He had been working in the Malaysian
jungle with American model Debra Harris for the U.S. magazine Town
and Country.
   He was taken to a medical center in Sabah, but two days later
was flown to Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital, accompanied by
his friend Mohamed Al Fayed, one of the Egyptian brothers who own
the famous Harrods department store in London.
   His illness was complicated by bronchial pneumonia and heart
problems, hospital officials said.
   Twiggy, the pencil-thin model who found fame in the 1960s,
described Parkinson today as ``one of the great eccentrics of the
photographic world.''
   ``He was a perfect gentleman and an amazing creative
photographer,'' she said. ``We have all lost a great exponent of
the photographic art, he was just something really special.''
   Among his best known portraits are those of Princess Anne,
daughter of Queen Elizabeth II, for Anne's 21st birthday in 1971,
and the queen's mother, Elizabeth, on her 80th birthday in 1980.
   Parkinson said that when he photographed the queen he found her
a nervous and difficult sitter. He once described the queen's
mother and Princess Anne as ``the most royal of all the royals.''
   Friends and the many models he photographed for Vogue magazine
and other glossy publications around the world knew him as
``Parks.''
   Educated at London's Westminster School, his skill with a camera
won him a clientele that included empresses, movie stars, top
models and pop stars as well as the royals.
   His ``snaps,'' as he called his photographs, were often
exhibited at the state-funded National Portrait Gallery in London
and featured in several best selling publications, including
``Sisters Under the Skin.''
   An eccentric dresser who sported a military-style mustache, he
listed his hobbies in Who's Who as sun worshipping, bird watching,
breeding Creole racehorses and pig farming.
   His business interest in British pigs led him recently to start
selling his own brand of pork sausages to top London stores such as
Harrods and Fortnum and Mason. His home for much of the last 25
years was on the Caribbean island of Tobago.
   Parkinson was married for 42 years to model and biographer Wenda
Rogerson, who died in 1987. He is survived by his son Simon.

<HEAD>Priest, Lawyer Say They Got Man a False ID at Ritter's Behest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for the nation's largest organization
for runaways and a priest have acknowledged providing a false
identity to a 26-year-old man they believed was a 19-year-old
prostitute, a newspaper reported today.
   The two men have said they created a new identity for Kevin Kite
at the behest of the Rev. Bruce Ritter, founder of the Covenant
House shelter for runaways, The New York Times reported today.
   Kite has charged that Ritter gave him money and gifts in return
for sex. The 62-year-old Roman Catholic priest has vehemently
denied those charges and similar ones since made by three other
men. Ritter has been placed on leave of absence from running the
shelter pending an investigation by Franciscan leaders.
   The Rev. Michael Duval has told church superiors that he
obtained birth and baptismal documents to falsify an identity for
Kite, the newspaper said. Covenant House officials originally said
Kite had obtained the false identity himself.
   Duval and the attorney, Gregory Loken, declined to be quoted,
but officials of the Roman Catholic Church and the shelter told the
Times how they tried to help Kite, who purportedly was running away
from an organized crime ring.
   According to the Times account:
   When Ritter brought Kite to New York from a Covenant House
shelter in New Orleans in February 1989, he introduced him as his
nephew. However, Ritter's niece learned that someone was using her
brother's name.
   So Ritter discussed a new identity with Loken, who called Duval,
parochial vicar of St. James Roman Catholic Church in Jamestown.
   Duval found in church records that a Timothy Michael Warner died
of leukemia in 1980 at age 10. The priest filled out a blank
baptismal certificate with the names of Timothy and his parents,
dated it Dec. 27, 1970, and signed it with another priest's name.
   Duval also obtained a certified copy of Timothy's birth
certificate, which is illegal for a non-family member to do. It was
not clear which state agency issued the certificate. The documents
were given to Kite.
   Monsignor David Lee, communications director for the Buffalo
Diocese, told the Times Duval's actions were ``absolutely and
totally contrary'' to church rules.
   Duval took a leave of absence from the church in August. He
resigned last week from his job as a family services caseworker in
Paterson, N.J., the Times said.
   Loken and Duval have said they believed Kite needed a new
identity so he could start a new life.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of a jetliner that crashed
with 146 people aboard may have tried to manually override the
plane's sophisticated computer control minutes before the disaster,
newspapers reported today.
   At least 91 people were killed Wednesday when the 3-month-old
Airbus 320 jetliner operated by Indian Airlines crashed 150 feet
short of the runway at Bangalore airport in south India.
   A spokesman for the state-run domestic carrier tried to
discourage speculation in the media about the cause of the crash.
   ``All these stories are speculations. In cases like such
crashes, how can you say what happened without a proper inquiry?''
said the spokesman, who declined to be identified.
   Press Trust of India said firefighters had found the flight data
recorder in the fuselage of the wrecked plane.
   The Times of India newspaper, quoting unidentified aviation
sources, said the crash may have occurred because the pilot ``tried
to change the mode of control from computer to manual or
vice-versa.''
   ``The response time of the in-flight computer for doing this is
five to six seconds,'' which is too little to make the switch at
the final stage of the landing, the newspaper said.
   Another daily, The Hindustan Times, said there was a strong
possibility of a ``last-minute bid by the pilot to change over from
computer to manual control and thus losing a valuable few seconds,
leading to the crash.''
   One publication, Science Report, said the aircraft's technology
includes a pre-programmed ``software that tells the computer _ and
not the pilot _ to make judgments.''
   If the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid collision, the
report said, the system ``will not let the airplane respond beyond
a certain rate.''
   The New Delhi-based Hindustan Times said the plane's instruments
may have indicated the wrong altitude, which may have misled the
pilot to descend earlier than he should have.
   John Mancosky, 28, of Chicago, said the plane began to shake
about five minutes earlier and at he first he thought the pilot
made a hard landing.
   ``Then we heard a loud booming noise and soon we were enveloped
in a ball of flame,'' said Mancosky, who, like most of the
survivors, escaped through the aircraft's rear door. He suffered a
broken leg.
   The plane's bottom hit a wall while coming down for the landing
and it slithered on the rough ground before bursting into flames
and breaking into at least four pieces.
   Among the 146 people on board were the seven-member crew and
four infants.
   The pilot and co-pilot were killed in the fire that engulfed
most of the plane, leaving only the tail intact. Most of the 55
survivors jumped down from the rear door.
   The airline spokesman at least 17 foreigners had been on the
flight. They included seven Americans, a Frenchman, two Canadians,
three Japanese and a Hong Kong man, embassy and airline officials
said.
   A U.S. Embassy official in New Delhi said one American died, one
was missing and five had survived. The official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said their identities would not be released
until families had been notified.
   The airline spokesman said a four-member team from Airbus
Industrie, the European consortium that makes the aircraft, had
arrived in India to help investigate the cause of the accident.
   Wednesday's crash was the latest in a series of accidents that
have earned Indian Airlines the reputation of being one of the
worst-managed carriers in the world.
   Poor morale among the staff has led to frequent strikes, and
flight delays are endemic. Employees allege that pre-flight safety
precautions are often ignored.
   The A320, which had logged less than 400 flying hours since
Indian Airlines acquired it in December, was one of 14 purchased
last year to try to upgrade the carrier's fleet.
   The last Indian Airlines disaster occurred Oct. 19, 1988, when a
Boeing 737 crashed on final approach in the western city of
Ahmedabad, killing 113 people on board. An inquiry blamed pilot
error for the crash, the worst in the airline's 27-year history.
   Wednesday's crash is only the second accident involving an A320
and the first in commercial service. Three people were killed and
50 injured when an A320 crashed at an air show in eastern France in
June 1988.
   The twin-engined, narrow-bodied jet is the first civilian
airliner with a fully computerized flight control system. It
consumes 40 percent less fuel than similar planes.

   A mutilated body found in the Mississippi
River had been embalmed, authorities said, leading them to believe
they have a case of grave robbery and not murder on their hands.
   Police Chief Bill McCutcheon said Wednesday that the mutilation
of the body of an unidentified boy apparently was part of a
``religious group, a fanatical group.''
   ``It's sick. You can't say it any better than that,'' he said.
``I mean, think about it.''
   Prints from the boy's foot ruled out the possibility that the
body found Tuesday was that of 11-year-old Jacob Wetterling,
sending waves of relief through the abducted boy's hometown of St.
Joseph in central Minnesota. Jacob disappeared last October.
   A worker at a Mississippi River dam found the unclothed body
Tuesday floating near the dam, authorities said. The hands, feet
and head had been severed. McCutcheon said the feet were later
found nearby.
   The body was described as that of a boy between the ages of 9
and 13.
   Authorities stopped treating the case as a homicide when a
coroner found embalming fluid in the body, McCutcheon said. The
time and cause of death and how long the body might have been in
the river were not immediately determined.
   Investigators were consulting cult experts to determine what
kinds of groups may have performed such a ritual. ``We're
interested in knowing if there was a ceremony down by the river,''
McCutcheon said.
   They also were checking with cemeteries to see if there were
unreported grave robberies.
   Sandy Gallant, a San Francisco police officer who has studied
occult crimes in the United States, said there have been cases of
grave robbery and mutilation as part of some ritual. But she said
she knows of no cases where a body was stolen, mutilated and then
discarded.
   ``It would make more sense if the body was found somewhere, at
the center of a ritual scene. They usually leave the body where it
can be found,'' she said.

   Renegade Gen. Michel Aoun's forces
pounded residential districts of east Beirut today and launched
tank attacks against the strongholds of a rival Christian militia.
   Police said eight major fires blazed out of control in the
Ashrafiyeh district as Aoun's tanks blasted positions of the
Lebanese Forces militia in the low-income district of Ein Rummaneh.
   They reported several other fires in the districts of Nabaa and
Ein Rummaneh, controlled by Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia.
   A police spokesman said Aoun was concentrating his ground
offensive on Ein Rummaneh, on the southeastern edge of Beirut,
while his gunners hammered Ashrafiyeh and the Lebanese Forces'
third stronghold at Nabaa with howitzer shells.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said at least three people were killed and 12 wounded in the sudden
barrage against Ashrafiyeh and Nabaa.
   Stray shells also crashed into densely populated residential
districts in Moslem west and south Beirut, killing at least four
people and wounding 39, by police count.
   The casualties raised the overall toll from 17 days of Christian
fighting to 522 killed and 1,775 wounded.
   The figures include 31 people killed and 149 wounded in the
city's Moslem districts, which have not been involved in the
fighting for mastery of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Hassan Hallak, a Shiite Moslem resident of Shiyah, a district
bordering Ein Rummaneh, said the Christian area was burning.
   ``A huge cloud hangs over Ein Rummaneh. Smoke billows from the
whole district,'' said Hallak.
   Moslem and Christian radio stations interrupted regular
programming to broadcast reports of renewed hostilities. A relative
lull had prevailed over east Beirut since Monday.
   Aoun's command, in a communique, blamed the clash on the
Christian militia. It said Geagea has ``fired the coup de grace''
at attempts by a mediation committee to work out a settlement to
the power struggle for control of the estimated 1 million
Christians who live in the enclave.
   The command of Geagea's militia countered the charge, saying the
general's men ``surprised civilians with heavy shelling early in
the day.''
   A police spokesman said the barrage started around 5:30 a.m.,
just as a few civilians were venturing out of underground shelters
to buy bread from the few bakeries that operated in the besieged
districts.
   Maronite Catholic Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir went on radio to
appeal to both Geagea and Aoun to stop fighting.
   ``The people are on the brink of despair,'' Sfeir said.
``Monasteries, schools and hospitals are in bad need of supplies to
help the the wounded, patients and refugees.''
   Both Geagea and Aoun are from the Maronite community that has
dominated key government posts, the army command and judiciary
since independence from France in 1943.
   Heavy clashes renewed a few hours after Geagea reiterated his
rejection of Aoun's proposal to disband the militia and transform
it into a political party.
   ``We want all Lebanese potentials preserved, including our
military forces,'' Geagea said Wednesday.
   Aoun had said Geagea's militiamen should join his army.
   ``Lebanese forces militiamen won't join the army. Our militiamen
are politically minded fighters. The army doesn't have a cause,''
Gagea told a news conference.
   Aoun rejects the Syrian-backed Christian-Moslem government of
President Elias Hrawi and has vowed to drive out the Syrian forces
backing Moslem militias. But his latest attentions have been
focused on maintaining his hold on the Christian heartland.

   One man has been charged with murder and a
second is in custody after they allegedly snatched the purse of a
woman as they drove by in a van. The woman was killed when she fell
under the vehicle.
   Angel Hernandez, 27, of New York, was charged with murder and
robbery in the Jan. 10 incident, Manhattan Chief of Detectives
Ronald Fenrich said Wednesday.
   The other suspect, whose name was not released, was already in
jail. He had been arrested Jan. 17 on car theft charges, the chief
said. New charges against him are awaiting a grand jury hearing.
   The victim, Kim Stapleton, 59, of New York, was crossing a
street shortly after noon when one of the suspects leaned out the
passenger door of a passing van and grabbed her purse. Mrs.
Stapleton was dragged a short distance as the mugger wrested her
handbag away and fell under the van's rear wheels, police said.
   Tips from three people Hernandez allegedly told about the
killing led detectives to a hotel, where they arrested him Tuesday
after a brief struggle, Fenrich said.
   The two men are suspects in as many as 20 other drive-by purse
snatchings dating from November 1989, police said.

<HEAD>Man Freed After 8 Years in Prison for Robbery He Didn't Commit</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Brown Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent nearly eight years
jailed for a grocery store robbery he never committed walked out of
prison after being given a full pardon.
   The release Wednesday of Michael Anthony Woten, 36, marked the
sixth time since 1984 that an inmate's conviction in Dallas County
has been thrown out or reversed and the person freed after spending
years in prison.
   The most famous case was that of Randall Dale Adams, who served
13 years after being convicted of killing a Dallas police officer
but was freed last year after his story was told in the film ``The
Thin Blue Line.'' Also free Wednesday was Joyce Ann Brown, after
prosecutors decided against trying her again on a charge in
connection with the holdup of a Dallas fur store.
   Gov. Bill Clements signed the pardon at midmorning in Austin.
Shortly afterward, Texas Department of Corrections officials picked
Woten up at the Eastham prison farm for the drive to the Walls Unit
at Huntsville, where he was given a new Social Security card, $200
and his freedom.
   Woten said inmates, guards and prison officials cheered and
clapped when he drove away. ``It was like being at a football
match.''
   ``I don't think it's quite hit me yet, until a few hours ago,''
Woten said later. ``I was still incarcerated and did only what I
was told to do. It's going to take me some time to realize that I'm
free and I can start doing what I want to do.''
   Woten had been convicted in the April 1982 armed robbery of a
north Dallas supermarket and sentenced to 55 years in prison. Five
witnesses testified that he was one of two men dubbed the Cowboy
Bandits who robbed that store and another grocery.
   Woten insisted that at the time of the robbery he was
hitchhiking from Dallas to St. Louis. He said he got a ride with a
trucker he could identify only as Don and ``Kangaroo'' _ the man's
citizens' band radio nickname.
   The Dallas Times Herald launched a search for ``Kangaroo'' after
Woten got a statement from another inmate that the inmate and
another man had robbed the store. The paper succeeded, and the man,
Don Fainter of Claycomo, Mo., told authorities last month he had
indeed given Woten a ride the day the robbery.
   Woten said he plans to open a leather crafts shop, taking
advantage of the leatherworking skills he learned in prison. After
trading his white prison shirt for a blue one, Woten swore he would
never again wear white.
   ``Even if I become a painter, I'm going to wear plaid,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush expressed
irritation with the news media today as he flew to Colombia for a
four-nation drug conference, criticizing reports that he said
suggested he was secretive and deceptive. ``From now on, it's going
to be a little different,'' Bush asserted.
   The president vowed to hold fewer news conferences and to
restrict his sessions with reporters in the future.
   ``I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something
deceptive,'' Bush fumed.
   Bush aired his grievances with the news media in a chat with
reporters aboard Air Force One, shortly before he landed here to
transfer to a helicopter that would take him to Cartagena for a
drug summit with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru.
   What apparently riled the president were news stories suggesting
that he had sometimes said one thing, then done something else.
   For instance, his comments at a news conference on Monday that
he did not think it was time for a four-power conference on the
future of Germany came a day before a major agreement on German
reuinification was reached in Ottawa.
   ``When I told you ... that I didn't think there'd be a deal and
there shortly was a deal, then I'm hit for deceiving you,'' Bush
said.
   He said that at his news conference he did not know that an
agreement that would involve oversight by the four post-World War
II European powers _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ was at hand.
   The president expressed his testiness from the start of today's
exchange with reporters accompanying him here on Air Force One.
   Bush had slept aboard the plane in a hangar at Andrews Air Force
Base in the Maryland suburbs so that he would not arrive in
Colombia sleepy after today's pre-dawn flight, and he was asked if
he had enjoyed a good night's sleep.
   ``I had a very good night's sleep. I can't get into the details
of that because some will say it's too much sleep, some will say
it's too little.''
   Then, the president added, ``I think we've had too many press
conferences. It's not good. It overdoes it. It's overexposure.''
   Bush has had about a news conference a week on the average,
since he took office on Jan. 20, 1989.
   ``I'm taking no answers to questions. I'm not going to discuss
what I'm going to bring up,'' Bush said when asked about his agenda
for the day's drug conference.
   ``I'm not going to discuss whether there's any surprises or not.
This is a new thing. This is a new approach.''
   Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio
Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to
extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs,
Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no
comment on whether I know about it or not. I can't comment on
whether it's true or not.''
   ``So from now on, it's going to be a little different,'' he
added. ``We're going to have a new relationship. It will be
pleasant. It will be fun. But it's different.''
   ``I'm not going to be burned for holding out or doing something
deceptive.''
   Bush did not mention which news reports he was referring to.
   However, today's editions of the Washington Post, copies of
which were on Bush's plane, had a story on what it called ``the
debate between President Bush and the press over secrecy and
deception.''

   Leftist guerrillas threw bombs at the United
States and Panamanian embassies and an American-owned auto parts
company office, causing some damage but no injuries, police said
today.
   In separate, nearly simultaneous attacks, the bombs were thrown
from passing cars shortly before midnight Wednesday, police said.
   Authorities found flyers at the facilities linking the three
bombings to the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement,
police said.
   They said the flyers criticized President Guillermo Endara of
Panama and called for new elections in Panama.
   Endara took over as Panama's president after U.S. troops invaded
the country Dec. 20 to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose
handpicked candidate had defeated Endara in an election widely
believed to be fraudulent.
   The invasion was sharply criticized by Peru's president, Alan
Garcia.
   Police said the bomb at the U.S. Embassy caused little damage.
The main door and several windows at the Panamanian Embassy were
destroyed.
   Windows and doors also were damaged at the offices of the auto
parts company, Champion S.A., which sells automobile spark plugs.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement is Peru's second
strongest guerrilla group after the Maoist Shining Path. The Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement took up arms against Peru's elected
government in 1984.

   Housing starts, boosted by the warmest January
on record, rebounded 29.6 percent for their biggest gain on record
last month after falling to a seven-year low during December's cold
spell, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.63 million units in
January after slumping a revised 6.9 percent in December. Starts in
December originally were reported to be down 7.9 percent.
   The department said the January increase, which it attributed to
unusually warm weather, was the highest since housing starts first
were recorded in 1959. It topped the previous record gain of 29.3
percent reached in July 1982.
   Analysts had expected a big jump in starts during January
because of the contrast in weather from December.
   Some, like Michael P. Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank in New
York, suggested in advance of today's report that a truer picture
of housing activity could be drawn by averaging the starts for the
two months.
   Thomas Holloway, senior economist for the Mortgage Bankers
Association, also said the jump was weather-related.
   ``Levels like the ones we're seeing here would indicate a
housing boom and there is just simply no fundamental reason to
believe that is going on,'' he said.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said January
temperatures were the warmest for that month since the government
began keeping records 96 years ago. December was the fourth coldest
on record, it said.
   Many analysts also expect starts this year to total about the
same as 1989's 1.37 million units because of the sluggish economy.
Some, however, said rising move interest rates could slow starts
further.
   Construction of single-family homes rose 24.8 percent in January
to an annual rate of 1.14 million units after falling 9.8 percent
in December.
   The increase was the steepest for single dwellings since a 26
percent gain in March 1979.
   Apartment construction jumped 42.3 percent to an annual rate of
488,000 units after a revised 1.8 percent gain in December. The
December figure originally had been reported to be a drop of 2.4
percent.
   January's gain in apartment starts was the sharpest since a 56
percent advance in January 1985.
   The Midwest recorded the steepest jump in overall starts, up
42.6 percent, but the other regions also posted sharp gain. Starts
were up 38.6 percent in the Northeast, 24.6 percent in the South
and 23.1 percent in the West.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, jumped 26.7 percent, the highest gain since a 30 percent
jump in June 1980. Applications had risen 2.5 percent in December.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, distancing
himself from the government he helped create, said today that a
reunified Germany poses no danger to Poland and he wants Soviet
troops out as soon as possible.
   The Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki has adopted a more tolerant attitude toward Soviet
withdrawal, saying the 40,000 troops in Poland should leave only
after creation of a new security arrangement for Europe.
   But Walesa insted that the Red Army withdraws this year.
   ``I will continue activities so that the Soviet troops are
removed from Poland as soon as possible,'' Walesa told reporters.
   Referring to suggestions from President Wojciech Jaruzelski and
the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza that the Soviet troops
help ensure Poland's security in the face of a reunifying Germany,
the Solidarity union chairman said:
   ``I don't envision any danger on the part of Germany because
Europe has had too many bad experiences to allow the Germans that.''
   Walesa also seemed to depart from the government's insistence
that Poland be present at planned six-nation German reunification
talks involving East Germany, West Germany and the four post-war
occupying powers: the United States, Soviet Union, Britain and
France.
   ``What is important is what role would Poland play'' at such
talks, Walesa said. ``...I think Poland could not be very effective
there,'' he said.
   But others in Poland, conquered twice this century by a united
Germany and then abandoned by the Allies to the Soviets, says it
cannot risk being shut out of talks on the future of Germany.
   ``Nothing about us, without us,'' government spokesman Henryk
Wozniakowski said Wednesday, quoting a Polish proverb.
   ``Our stand is that our security matters cannot be settled by
proxy for us. We must be present,'' Mazowiecki told a news
conference in London.
   East and West Germany and the four powers that occupied Germany
at the end of World War II agreed Tuesday on a framework for talks
that will lead to German reunification.
   Some Germans, including West German Finance Minister Teodor
Waigel, say Germany still in theory exists within its 1937 borders
_ in other words, spreading over much of present-day Poland. West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday passed up an opportunity
to allay Polish fears, saying that decision should be left to the
future government.
   ``We are the only country in which the situation is unclear,''
said Wozniakowski.
   Poland is not seeking full membership in the talks, he said. But
it does insist on participating in those sessions that touch on its
``vital interests,'' primarily the question of German borders.
   Wozniakowski said Britain, the United States and the Soviet
Union were sympathetic to Poland's appeal and Mazowiecki
``certainly'' will press for East Berlin's support Friday when East
German Premier Hans Modrow visits.
   Resistance, however, was coming from West Germany.
   A Bonn government official said Poland or other neighboring
states had no reason to be involved in the negotiations.
   ``The unification proposal involves only the territory of West
Germany, East Germany and Berlin,'' he said on condition of
anonymity. ``There is no reason for fear in Poland.''
   Poles are sensitive to the issue because of past German
aggression and because right-wing German politicians have never
reliquished claims to the 40,000 square miles of territory Poland
was awarded from Germany at the end of World War II _ compensation
for an even larger area taken from Poland by the Soviet Union.
   The territory acquired after World War II comprises about
one-third of present-day Poland.
   Germans fled or were expelled after the war and millions of
Poles, mostly expelled from the Soviet-annexed territories, moved
in. Today, about 10.4 million of Poland's 38 million people live on
formerly German territory.
   Only about 1 million ethnic Germans live in Poland now.

<HEAD>Democrats Work to Raise California's Primary Profile</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts graf 9, Scott Scowry, with Republican comment</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party is changing its rules to
permit California to hold one of the first presidential primaries
of 1992, a move aimed at giving the nation's largest state more
influence in selecting the nominee.
   Party activists say other states may advance the dates of their
primaries as well.
   The Democratic National Committee's rules panel voted Wednesday
to allow most states to hold primaries or caucuses as early as the
first Tuesday in March, one week after New Hampshire holds the
first primary and one week earlier than previously allowed.
   The change is expected to be approved easily by the full DNC
next month.
   It means a proposal now in the California legislature to set its
presidential primaries on March 3, 1992, would be permissible under
national Democratic Party rules.
   The California assembly has approved shifting the state's
presidential primary from June to that early March date, and a
state Senate vote is expected.
   ``The obvious intention is to give California the chance to go
early and the opportunity to have more say in the process,'' said
Donald L. Fowler, cochairman of the rules committee and DNC member
from South Carolina.
   ``I anticipate other states will move up to that Tuesday,'' he
said. ``I don't think other states will let California have that
Tuesday to themselves.''
   Scott Scowry, deputy press secretary for the Republican National
Committee, said, ``We're delighted with the prospect'' of
California holding both parties' primaries in early March. He said
he did not believe any GOP rules would be affected by California's
change.
   The new Democratic rules still allow Iowa's caucuses to be the
first presidential delegate-selection event, followed eight days
later by New Hampshire's primary. A special provision would permit
Maine to begin its caucus process earlier too, but other states
would have to fall within the so-called ``window'' from the first
Tuesday in March to the second Tuesday in June.
   California, under this schedule, would become the first big
state to vote, holding its primary one week after New Hampshire's.
The so-called Super Tuesday round of primaries would follow a week
after California, and Illinois would follow a week later.
   ``It is important that a large state crucial to electing a
Democratic president weigh in early in the process,'' Brown said.
   California's June primary date in past years has placed it at
the end of the delegate-selection process, when the nominee was
already a foregone conclusion.
   ``California felt very strongly they wanted to be a player in
the process,'' said Alice Travis, a member of the DNC executive
committee from California. ``Coming last made it somewhat
irrelevant.''
   Some believe placing California so early in the primary season
will diminish the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire, by
tradition the two earliest states. With California following so
quickly, they reason, well-financed, well-known candidates may
concentrate instead on California, the state with the most
delegates.
   Party strategists hope that advancing primary calendar will
enable the party to decide on a nominee earlier in the year and
have more time to concentrate on the general election campaign.
   But Fowler cautioned there could be unintended consequences _
such as splintering the field and prolonging the selection of a
nominee.
   ``This is a mechanical adjustment, the political impact of which
is unknown and subject to various interpretations,'' Fowler said.
   Other changes allow the party to apply a new sanction against
states that violate national party rules by holding their primaries
or caucuses too early, or violate other delegate-selection rules.
The change would provide an automatic 25 percent reduction in the
state's total delegates.
   In the past, the only sanction available to the party was
refusal to seat a violating state's delegation _ a sanction so
severe the party often ignored violations.

   The Liberal Democratic Party is likely to hold on
to its majority in the lower house of Parliament following the
general election, according to public opinion polls published today.
   But from 30 percent to 40 percent of voters questioned remained
undecided, according to surveys by the Asahi Shimbun, the Yomiuri
Shimbun, the Mainichi Shimbun, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Kyodo
News Service.
   Also today, a shot was fired at a campaign car of a candidate,
slightly wounding one of the politician's assistants, a news report
said.
   The five nationwide surveys _ conducted in the past two weeks
and released three days before Sunday's election _ reached similar
conclusions.
   The Asahi survey of 103,200 eligible voters projected the
Liberal Democrats will end up with 271 seats in the House of
Representatives, down from their current 295 seats but well over
257 seats needed for a majority.
   The lower house names the prime minister and has the power to
adopt the national budget and treaties, even without approval of
the upper house, which can block legislation on other issues.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun put the Liberal Democrats' total at 260
seats, while Mainichi Shimbun estimated 265.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a financial daily, said the Liberal
Democrats may lose about 10 seats to the Socialists but that the
conservative party's new candidates ``are faring well,'' and will
offset some veterans' losses.
   Yomiuri questioned 100,000 voters; Mainichi 91,520 and Nikon
Keizai 52,000.
   Kyodo News Service, in a poll of 110,000 voters, said the
Liberal Democrats will win at least 259 seats and could get up to
285.
   The polls generally agreed the leading opposition group, the
Japan Socialist Party, will do well, reaching 120 seats from its
previous 85, according to the Asahi.
   Other major opposition parties _ the Clean Government Party with
54 seats in the last session, the Japan Communist Party with 26 and
the Democratic Socialist Party with 25 _ are all projected to lose
strength.
   The polls were done through interviews of a set number of voters
in each of Japan's 130 constituencies. No margins of error were
provided.
   Opposition parties are criticizing the Liberal Democrats for an
unpopular 3 percent sales tax instituted in April and for their
involvement with the Recruit Inc., a large conglomerate that tried
to influence politicians with contributions and cheap stock deals.
   Opposition candidates are calling for political reform to
prevent corruption and are seeking support among traditionally
conservative farmers by stressing their opposition to opening
Japan's agricultural markets to less expensive imports.
   Besides the apparent vulnerability of the governing party, the
other new wrinkle in this campaign year has been the level of
violence.
   Kyodo News Service said from Yamaguchi, 500 miles southwest of
Tokyo, that a shot was fired today from a pellet gun at a campaign
car of candidate Shinji Sato, a former transport minister and
four-term Liberal Democratic lawmaker.
   Sato was not in the car, but a woman campaign assistant was
slightly injured, the report said.
   On Tuesday, Liberal Democrat candidate Koichi Hamada, a former
vice minister of agriculture, was hit on the head with a club as he
was leaving a campaign rally in a city east of Tokyo. He suffered
moderate injuries.
   Police arrested a member of one of Japan's largest criminal
syndicates and said he told them he ``wanted to hurt'' Hamada
``because he has a bad personality.''
   On Wednesday, a male telephone caller warned that a bomb was
aboard an airplane carrying Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi
on a campaign trip. No bomb was found.
   On Sunday, a member of a rightist group walked into a campaign
office of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and fired three
shots at a television set, a campaign poster and a doll symbolizing
good luck, police said.
   Nakasone was out campaigning at the time and no one was injured,
they said.
   Nagasaki Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima was shot in the back on Jan. 18
as he was leaving city hall. The rightist charged in the shooting
told police he hated Motoshima because the mayor said the late
Emperor Hirohito shared some of the responsibility for World War II.

<HEAD>Soviet Lawmakers Debate Whether to Let Citizens Own Property</HEAD>

   Soviet legislators clashed today over a proposal
to restore private property rights in the Soviet Union, and one
Ukrainian lawmaker said such an idea is so radical that it should
be put to a national referendum.
   ``We have to ask the people,'' said lawmaker Leonid Sukhov of
Kharkov. ``The people know better.''
   While the 35-article property bill does not go as far as to use
the word ``private property,'' it does recognize the right for the
existence of diverse forms of property and says that citizens can
own property, including houses and apartments, for private use.
   The proposal does not clearly state whether land can be
privately owned. State ownership of all land is a fundamental
principle of Marxism.
   In another departure from orthodox dogma, which forbids
individuals to own factories and equipment on a large-scale, the
bill says citizens can now own the ``means of production'' for
farming and other labor activities.
   The bill also would allow foreigners to enjoy the same rights as
Soviet citizens in owning property. Citizens could own stocks and
bonds.
   Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin urged the legislature today
to consider the proposal with great care. Abalkin addressed the
packed legislature that had adopted a 22-point agenda, which
includes measures to strengthen the presidency now held by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   After its first reading before the 542-member Supreme Soviet
last fall, the bill underwent substantial revisions with at least
10,000 changes written into the lengthy draft, the Tass news agency
reported.
   During the initial debate, conflict arose over who currently
owns land and natural resources _ the national government or the
individual republics. That issue has been skirted in the draft in
favor of phrasing that says the land and its resources ``belong to
people living on a given territory.''
   The issue is critical because the legislature in Lithuania has
already adopted laws that allow the sale of land to individuals.
   In his report read at the start of the session today, Abalkin, a
noted Soviet economist who helped write the draft, told the
legislators that attempts have been made to reach a compromise
during the course of revision.
   But already today the bill aroused controversy at the Supreme
Soviet, which was meeting in a building in the Kremlin. More than
20 speakers asked to take the floor for a five-minute chance to
suggest changes or express approval.
   One speaker objected to the introduction of private property on
the ground that it would favor city dwellers with money rather than
collective farm workers who had spent their life on the land but
had no savings.
   Another speaker claimed that the language of the bill was too
vague and that it needed to be rewritten in a clearer fashion.
   At a news conference after the morning session, Abalkin
acknowledged that society had mixed feelings about the bill, but
that the important thing was that no option could be excluded in
the pursuit of economic reform.
   He said it was important that there should be complete freedom
for individuals in economic activity and that local authorities
should have greater responsibility in establishing property laws.
   Debate was continuing today.

<HEAD>Six Air Force Base Guards Suspended While Alleged Klan Activity
Probed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six Carswell Air Force Base security
police have been suspended from regular duty pending an
investigation into alleged ties to the Ku Klux Klan, a base
spokeswoman said.
   ``Their commander was notified of alleged Klan involvement, and
they were removed from normal security police duties,'' said Capt.
Barbara Carr.
   Membership in the Klan does not violate military rules, but
disciplinary action could be taken if it is determined that the
guards broke civilian laws while engaging in Klan activities, she
said.
   Ms. Carr said she doesn't know whether other base personnel are
being investigated.
   Only one of the six has been identified _ Sgt. Timothy Hall, 24,
who also worked for the Tarrant County Sheriff's Department. He was
fired from that job after the department learned he is the
``kleagle,'' or chief Klan recruiter, in Texas.
   Hall was suspended from his Air Force base job Saturday after he
was fired from the county job. Ms. Carr announced the suspension of
the five other Air Force guards Wednesday.
   Hall has acknowledged being a Klan official, but says his
personal beliefs have not affected his work in the sheriff's
deparment.
   ``Just because I wear a badge does not give me the right to
force those beliefs on the public at large,'' he said.
   Two other sheriff's department workers who were fired because of
alleged Klan ties, Charlyn Kay Moore and David White, have declined
to comment on the advice of their attorneys pending their appeals.

   A jury ordered a radio station and two disc
jockeys to pay $694,200 in damages to a news director whom they
referred to with risque jokes on a ``shock radio'' program.
   Liz Randolph, 32, claimed the jokes, which implied she was
promiscuous and mentally unstable, caused her to suffer panic
attacks and led her to seek psychiatric treatment.
   Disc jockeys Jim Quinn and Donald ``Banana Don'' Jefferson, and
EZ Communication, owner of WBZZ-FM, were found liable for
defamation and invasion of privacy and ordered to pay about
$260,000 in damages.
   Ms. Randolph won an additional $390,000 from Quinn and Jefferson
for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   In addition, the jury awarded Ms. Randolph $30,704 for medical
bills and $13,500 for lost wages.
   Ms. Randolph said she was glad she had endured a two-week trial
that made public much of her personal life, including details of
her psychiatric history.
   ``We knew it was going to be tough,'' she said.
   One of her attorneys, Samuel P. Kamin, said Wednesday's verdict
by the Allegheny County Common Pleas jury sends a message to
broadcasters about airing risque humor, especially jokes that
target co-workers.
   ``I think that's something the industry's going to have to think
twice about now,'' he said. ``The signal this sends is the
workplace is no place for abuse.''
   ``I think there's no question this will have an impact on the
kind of conduct you'll hear on morning shows,'' said Jeff Pollack,
a Los Angeles-based media adviser. ``It's clear this case will make
a lot of people think twice what they say to fellow workers on the
air.''
   Pollack said innuendo of the type used on Quinn and Jefferson's
show is common in morning radio talk shows around the nation. The
verdict could restrict creative freedom and make disgruntled
employees more likely to sue, he said.
   Jimmy Roach, part of the morning team at WMYG-FM in Pittsburgh,
said off-beat humor has its place in radio. But members of a
broadcast team should agree on jokes and comedy bits before they
are aired, he said.
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred C. Sikes has
been cracking down on ``shock radio'' since he took office in
August. Twelve stations have been cited for indecency since then.
   Ms. Randolph began working for WBZZ in May 1985 and walked off
the job Jan. 22, 1988, after Quinn and Jefferson aired a joke she
said shocked her.
   The disc jockeys and station management contended the remarks
were not meant to be taken seriously and said Ms. Randolph knew the
``absurdist'' format of the broadcast when she was hired. They also
said she did not complain about the jokes to the announcers or to
management.
   Quinn, 46, and Jefferson, 30, were not in the courtroom when the
verdict was announced and their attorney, Foster S. Goldman Jr.,
said no decision had been made about appealing the case.

<HEAD>First Guilty Plea in Noriega Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pilot who flew cocaine profits to Panama pleaded
guilty today to one count of illegally transporting funds, becoming
the first person indicted with former Panama dictator Manuel
Noriega to admit wrongdoing.
   But the attorney for Eduardo Pardo, 44, said he did not know if
his client would testify against Noriega and the other defendants
in the drug conspiracy case.
   ``That's all up to him,'' said lawyer William Meadows, a former
U.S. attorney in Miami, who said there was no plea bargain with the
government.
   The pilot pleaded guilty to making a flight with $800,000 in
drug money from Fort Lauderdale to Panama in 1983. Noriega, who is
still arguing with prosecutors over their right to prosecute him,
is accused of taking payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told Pardo he could face up
to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine on the charges.
   Attending Pardo's change-of-plea hearing were several attorneys
for the other five defendants either in custody or out on bond,
including Noriega's lawyer Frank Rubino.
   Federal prosecutors, who are under a gag order in the case,
refused to comment on the plea.
   Richard Sharpstein, attorney for defendant Brian Alden Davidow,
told The Associated Press that even without an agreement to testify
for the government, Pardo's plea made him a likely witness.
   ``Now that he's pleaded guilty, Pardo can be summoned before a
federal grand jury to testify, and cannot invoke the Fifth
Amendment against self-incrimination,'' Sharpstein said.
   At a hearing Wednesday, government and defense attorneys
wrangled over what the defense said was a failure of the
prosecution to turn over an inventory of materials seized in
Noriega's homes and offices in Panama.
   Noriega attorney Steven Kollin told Magistrate William C.
Turnoff: ``We haven't received the inventories and we feel we are
being stonewalled. I feel we are dealing with two governments _ the
military and the U.S. attorney's office.''
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P. Sullivan told Turnoff:
``We have supplied a partial inventory and we are continuing to
update all the time and they have been sent to Mr. Kollin.''
   Kollin said he had not received the partial inventory, but
Turnoff said that he felt the government was making a good faith
effort to comply with his orders.

<HEAD>Hackers Convicted of Selling Computer Codes to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CELLE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three West German hackers were found
guilty today of selling Western military computer codes to the
Soviet KGB and given suspended sentences ranging from 14 months to
two years.
   Dirk Brzezinski, Peter Carl and Markus Hess were arrested in
March after an investigation by U.S. and West German officials
revealed the three had obtained passwords and codes giving them
access to key military and research computers in the United States,
Western Europe and Japan.
   A fourth man, 30-year-old Karl Koch, who was also arrested in
the case, committed suicide in May.
   At the trial, which began Jan. 11, all three admitted guilt in
obtaining the codes to sell them to a Soviet KGB agent in East
Berlin.
   In today's decision, Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said the three
were given suspended sentences because ``it could not be proven
that substantial damage had been done to the Federal Republic (West
Germany) or its NATO partners.'' But Spiller also said the three
sold the computer codes for money.
   Carl was sentenced to 24 months, Hess 20 months and Brzezinski
14 months.
   All three men were freed on suspended sentences as long as they
stay out of trouble with the law for the duration of their terms.
   Carl, 35, told the court during the trial that he could only
identify the KGB agent he dealt with as ``Serge'' and said he did
not wish to reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court
for fear of reprisals.
   Court records show that Carl made at least 25 contacts with the
Soviets and received a total $54,500 for the computer information,
which was split among the hackers, amateurs who figure out ways to
access private computer systems.
   Brzezinksi, 30, told the court that Koch had the original idea
of selling the information to the KGB.
   According to Brzezinski, Koch claimed he had gained access to
the U.S. Defense Department general databank known as Optimus.
   U.S. and West German news media reported the hackers also gained
access to a NASA and a ``Star Wars'' research computer, and
computers linked to nuclear weapons and energy research in New
Mexico and the Fermi Laboratory in Illinois.
   However, U.S. officials said last year that although the hackers
obtained sensitive codes and passwords to enter the computers, they
were stopped short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviets by the hackers.

<HEAD>UMW To Go Ahead With Pittston Contract Vote</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers is proceeding with a
rank-and-file vote on a contract with Pittston Coal Group though
$64 million in strike-related fines have not been dropped, a UMW
official said today.
   The union's turnabout means that a vote to end the 10-month
strike against the nation's largest coal exporter could come as
early as Monday, according to Don McCamey, secretary-treasurer of
UMW District 28 in Castlewood.
   UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts plans to meet with local and
district union officials tonight at Castlewood High School to brief
them on terms of the contract, UMW officials confirmed.
   There also will be an emergency meeting of the UMW board in
Duffield tonight, they said.
   Roberts plans to meet Friday with Pittston's 1,700 union miners
on strike in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. UMW rules
specify that a 48-hour period must pass before a vote so miners
have time to study the terms of the contract.
   A settlement was reached New Year's Eve with the help of William
Usery, a special mediator appointed by Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, but terms have not been disclosed publicly. Sources familiar
with the agreement, however, said the union won concessions they
sought on the two biggest concerns: job security and health and
retirement benefits.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said on Jan. 1 that the union would
withhold a rank-and-file vote until all legal action connected with
the strike was settled.
   On Monday, Russell County Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin
refused to dismiss $64 million in fines against the union for
several hundred violations of court-ordered strike restrictions.
   McGlothlin rejected arguments by attorneys for the union and the
company, which joined in the motion to drop the fines, and he
refused the union's offer of 10,000 hours of community service.
However, he gave the attorneys 10 days to come up with another
proposal to clear the contempt-of-court fines.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams agreed to reduce
the fines he levied from $960,000 to $280,000 and Trumka responded
later in the day that the federal judge's decision to uphold a
nearly a third of the fines would not in itself hold up a contract
vote.

<HEAD>NASA Experiment Gets Galileo to Send Venus Photos Early</HEAD>

   NASA engineers were unwilling to wait
until October to see the Galileo spacecraft's photographs of Venus,
so they used an experimental method to get three of the pictures
sent to Earth early.
   One of the photos released Wednesday shows clouds as small as 25
miles wide as well as clouds rising from lower in the atmosphere.
It was taken Monday night when the Jupiter-bound Galileo was about
1 million miles past Venus, the second planet from the sun.
   ``You can see clouds, and you can see some very interesting
detail in the cloud patterns,'' said Neal Ausman, Galileo mission
director at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``The engineers and scientists are
exceptionally pleased.''
   Galileo is scheduled to go into orbit around Jupiter in December
1995 in a $1.35 billion mission to study the solar system's largest
planet. Just before 10 p.m. PST last Friday, the spacecraft swooped
about 10,025 miles over Venus so that planet could act as a gravity
slingshot to help hurl the spacecraft on its way to Jupiter.
   Most of the photographs and other data collected during and
after the flyby won't be sent back until October, when the
spacecraft is closer to Earth. Galileo's main antenna now is furled
to protect it from the heat of the sun. A smaller antenna, which
can transmit and receive information only at a very slow rate, is
being used almost exclusively to operate the spacecraft.
   But NASA engineers were able to get Galileo to send the three
photos back to Earth on Monday and Tuesday by transferring separate
batches of the computer data that make up each image for radio
transmission, Ausman said.
   NASA spokesman Jim Wilson called the technique ``experimental
and difficult.''
   Ausman said engineers also were able to get the spacecraft to
send back some infrared light measurements designed to study Venus'
lower atmosphere, as well as ultraviolet light measurements and
data from sensors designed to detect dust and magnetic fields in
space around Venus.
   By the time Galileo's fly-by of Venus formally ends Friday
night, the spacecraft's television camera will have taken about 80
pictures of cloud-shrouded Venus.
   Many other spacecraft have photographed Venus, some from much
closer than Galileo. But the new photos still should have
scientific value, Ausman said.
   Galileo was deployed from the space shuttle Atlantis last Oct.
18 on a looping 2.4 billion, six-year route that requires Venus and
Earth to be used as gravity slingshots to hurl the spacecraft to
Jupiter. It will fly past Earth on Dec. 8, then again on Dec. 8,
1992.
   Meanwhile, in the outer reaches of the solar system, the Voyager
1 spacecraft sent radio signals indicating it had successfully
snapped photographs to make up the first group portrait of the
solar system, according to JPL spokeswoman Mary Hardin.
   Voyager 1, which photographed Jupiter in 1980 and Saturn in
1981, was ordered to shoot the pictures Tuesday evening. But it
took five hours and 36 minutes for confirmation of the photographs
to travel the 3.7 billion miles to Earth, Hardin said Wednesday.

   A federal indictment charges seven people with
plotting to blow up a nuclear plant, airport, dam and other
installations to try to spring a jailed drug runner.
   The indictment was unsealed Wednesday after a four-year
investigation by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said U.S. Attorney Ray Rukstele.
   Five of those named were already in custody on drug and
racketeering charges, including the drug runner whose freedom was
allegedly being sought. The two remaining suspects were arrested
Wednesday, Rukstele said.
   The indictment says the seven planned to bomb a nuclear power
plant, an East Coast airport, power transmission towers, a dam and
a Navy ship in a scheme to barter the release of Jerry Allen
LeQuire of Maryville, Tenn.
   Rukstele declined to identify the intended targets.
   LeQuire, 46, was convicted last year in an Alabama federal court
of importing about 33 tons of cocaine to the southeastern United
States. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to be served after
a 36-year term he was already serving for other drug-related
convictions.
   Indicted with LeQuire Tuesday were Bonnie Sue Anders, 41, of
Corbin, Ky.; Michael Carl Jenkins, 40, of Greenback, Tenn.; Charles
Allen LeQuire, 26, William Michael LeQuire, 28, and James Thomas
LeQuire, 39, all of Maryville, Tenn.; and Gene Edward LeQuire, 42,
of Louisville, Tenn.
   Authorities would not comment beyond information contained in
the indictment, so it was not immediately clear how the other
LeQuires were related to Jerry Allen LeQuire.
   The seven are charged with conspiracy to violate federal
explosives laws, two counts of detonating explosives to destroy
property used in interstate commerce and illegally transporting
explosives across state lines. Jenkins also is accused of bombing
two transmission towers near Atlanta in 1985.
   The seven face possible 35-year jail sentences and fines of up
to $1 million if convicted.
   According to the indictment, the plot was supposed to work this
way:
   The group would acquire explosives and rent a house in Orlando,
Fla., where some of the explosives would be stored. An innocent
dupe of Latin American origin would be found to live in the house.
Jenkins was to carry out the actual bombings, the indictment said.
   After each bombing, The Miami Herald would be phoned and told
the bombings were in retaliation for American actions in Central
America.
   Jerry LeQuire then would offer, through his Latin American drug
contacts, to help ``find'' the bomber in exchange for his freedom.
He would produce the address of the house and the dupe would be
arrested.
   The indictment does not say if a dupe was found. It says the
plotting took place between June 1985 and January 1986.
   The two arrested in Knoxville, Tenn., Wednesday were Gene and
William LeQuire, Rukstele said.

   A strong eruption of Redoubt Volcano
this morning blew abrasive ash more than six miles into the sky and
across the Cook Inlet toward the port town of Homer.
   State Seismologist John Davies said the latest eruption began at
4:03 a.m.
   ``We've got reports from the Drift River (oil) Terminal that
there's a lot of lightning around the mountain,'' Davies said.
``They're packing up to evacuate.
   ``We also got reports from troopers in Homer that they can see
the ash clouds ... that the winds appear to be taking the steam and
ash plume in that direction.''
   The mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel and mail in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays because the airborne ash particles
can damage or shut down aircraft engines.
   The Federal Aviation Administration immediately issued new
flight restrictions today, warning aircraft to remain at least 20
miles from the mountain.
   An airline pilot en route to Anchorage reported an ash cloud
ranging from 31,000- to 33,000 feet today, Davies said.
   ``Winds at that flight level were about 91 knots (105 mph), and
they were blowing from the northwest,'' Davies said.
   ``Seismic signals from the mountain during the initial moments
of the eruption were as strong as any we've received since the
mountain became active several months ago,'' Davies said.
   The mountain began generating more earthquake activity a couple
of days ago, leading seismologists to believe another eruption was
coming, he said. ``We did expect one, but not this soon.''
   An state trooper dispatcher in Soldotna confirmed that ash was
falling in the Ninilchik area of the Kenai Peninsula. But she said
there were no immediate reports of any ash fall around Soldotna.
   Redoubt Volcano is 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   A KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Boeing 747 encountered an ash cloud
from Redoubt on Dec. 15, two days after the mountain began
erupting. The ash clogged all four engines and the aircraft fell
more than two miles before the engines could be restarted.
   It made a successful emergency landing at Anchorage
International Airport, but preliminary estimates of damage to the
three-month-old aircraft were $50 million.

   Nelson Mandela said today that his
guerrilla movement considers government installations to be
legitimate targets for attack and that civilians inevitably will be
caught in the cross fire.
   Mandela, released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, said there
has been no decision to suspend the armed struggle, which has been
largely dormant in recent months.
   ``Our objective is that the targets are government
installations,'' Mandela said in an interview from his home in
Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg. ``In a conflict
civilians must be caught up in cross fire.''
   Mandela helped launch the African National Congress' guerrilla
campaign in 1961, a year after the organization was outlawed. The
official policy always has been to limit attacks to government
facilities and personnel, although some ANC leaders have expressed
a desire to hit civilian targets.
   There have been numerous attacks on civilians in recent years,
but the ANC has said those were the results of guerrillas who had
not undergone proper training.
   President F.W. de Klerk legalized the ANC on Feb. 2, but the
group says its armed struggle remains one of its strategies to put
pressure on the government.
   Asked if the country's 5 million whites would have to change
their lifestyles under an ANC government, Mandela said: ``They are
already adjusting themselves to changes.''
   He cited recently integrated beaches, the fact that a few select
neighborhoods have been opened to all races and that some private
schools are integrated, although public schools remain segregated.
   ``Whites in this country are a very important section of the
community and without them, without their cooperation, we will have
immense problems,'' Mandela said. ``That is why we are so keen to
ensure ... that the changes we are demanding are not going to mean
domination of whites or blacks.''
   De Klerk wants to negotiate a new constitution that will include
the 28 million black majority in the national government. But he
opposes a one-man, one-vote system and outright black majority
rule. He envisions some mechanism that will give whites veto power
on major policy decisions.
   Earlier today, Mandela met Jesse Jackson on his final day of an
eight-day visit to South Africa.
   The former Democratic presidential candidate said South African
blacks still were not free and the United States and Western Europe
must put pressure, including economic sanctions, on the government
to end apartheid.
   ``We must not lower the standards of democracy or expectations
for democracy in South Africa,'' Jackson said.
   In the capital of Pretoria, supporters of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party held a rally to call for the removal of de Klerk
and new elections.
   ``Our people have kept a low profile up to now, but we have
fought for our own fatherland and that fatherland you will not take
away from us,'' Conservative leader Andries Treurnicht told a rally
Wednesday night in Bloemfontein.
   The opposition has denounced de Klerk for freeing Mandela and
legalizing the ANC and other black opposition groups in an effort
to start talks on ending the white monopoly on power.
   The Conservative Party wants South Africa split into separate
states for whites and blacks. It received 31 percent of the vote in
September elections, in which only whites could vote.
   Government officials said 1,000 army troops would be deployed in
Natal Province to help police quell fighting between conservative
and radical black factions. Police said protesters fired at police
vehicles overnight, and one officer was shot and wounded near
Durban.
   Mandela, in news interviews Wednesday, said the ANC is willing
to compromise with the white government on a post-apartheid
constitution as long as blacks are guaranteed full voting rights.
   The 71-year-old black leader, in his first interviews since his
release Sunday after 27 years in prison, also praised de Klerk,
saying that because of his flexibility and integrity, ``the
possibility of a settlement is always there.''
   Mandela was asked if the ANC was willing to negotiate over its
demand for a one-person, one-vote system that would lead to black
majority rule.
   ``Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population group
but the country as whole,'' Mandela told reporters.
   The ANC repeatedly has rejected any system falling short of
one-person, one-vote, but Mandela's comments indicated the movement
would at least be willing to let this be a topic for negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Streets were virtually abandoned and
fishing boats were kept away from Cartagena Bay docks today amid
unusually heavy security surrounded the convening of a four-nation
drug summit.
   ``First class. We've got the best, the best,'' President Bush
said of the extraordinary protective measures taken in his behalf.
   Security already had been heightened in Cartagena Bay by the
time the president arrived aboard Air Force One at Barranquilla, a
Caribbean port city some 60 miles northeast of the summit site.
   Naval authorities closed off Cartagena's bay to private boat
traffic and were guarding it with frogmen, frigates, high-speed
patrol boats and at least one submarine. Helicopters hovered above
high-rise luxury hotels, where guests were being required to submit
to fingerprinting.
   A Colombian frigate had stationed itself just off the coast of
the peninsula and small patrol boats were speeding along the shores
with machine guns pointed inland. Across the bay from the
peninsula, authorities had forced the fishing boats that normally
crowd Cartagena's docks to leave, and except for some decrepit
ships too damaged to move, the wharves were empty.
   Scores of troops also surrounded the convention center where
much of the international press watched Barco's welcoming speech
broadcast on a giant screen television from the guest house across
the bay.
   Soldiers wearing camoflauge uniforms and resting automatic
rifles on their hips were standing on the roof of the convention
center as military patrols roamed the sun baked streets below.
   Cartagena's streets, normally packed with traffic and
pedestrians in the early morning hours, were practically empty.
   Public and private schools were closed, and some residents said
they were staying home from work for fear that violence might
accompany Bush's visit.
   Bush was meeting with presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia,
Jaime Paz of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peru to sign an agreement
to combat cocaine trafficking.
   Already stringent security measures were wound even tighter
today as about 5,000 security agents from the four countries
represented at the anti-drug summit roamed the city and scouted the
Colombian naval base where the meeting was being held.
   The base houses the presidential guest residence where Barco and
Paz stayed Wednesday night. Bush and Garcia arrived today.
   The U.S. security forces have taken extraordinary measures to
guard Bush following a report in December that Colombian drug lords
had taken a $30 million contract on the president's life and
reports that surface-to-air missiles had been acquired to shoot
down his plane.
   Two U.S. warships, the Nassau and the Sampson, were cruising off
the Colombian coast. The Nassau carries a Marine amphibious assault
company that can be used in the case of an emergency.
   Colombian navy frogmen were checking the bay, apparently looking
for explosives near the Spanish fortification where the presidents
were meeting.
   Some Cartagena residents, saying they feared such an emergency,
told The Associated Press they were staying at home today to avoid
any trouble. The Colombians, all of whom asked not to be
identified, said they feared possible attacks by drug traffickers
as well as leftist guerrilla groups.
   The government estimates there are 10,000 rebel forces active in
the country.
   Colombians also said they feared protests over the Bush visit
like the student demonstrations at Bogota's National University on
Wednesday. About 100 hooded students threw rocks at police who had
fired tear gas to break up the demonstration.
   There were no injuries but several arrests were reported.
   Municipal officials decided to close area schools today. They
did not give a reason for their decision, but some parents said
they assumed it was because of the threat of violence.
   The largest U.S. school in the Colombian capital of Bogota, the
Nueva Granada school, also was closed as a security precaution.
   During a 1982 visit to Bogota, Bush escaped an apparent
assassination plot in which a load of dynamite was buried under the
lone runway at the Bogota airport. The explosives were found hours
after Bush's plane took off, and security officials discovered the
dynamite was connected to wires running to an electrical generator
300 yards away.

   Perrier has ordered distributors worldwide to dump
160 million bottles of its bubbly water because a toxic chemical
may be contained in some shipments. Officials say the move will
disrupt distribution for three months.
   In yanking shipments from distribution in 120 countries, Perrier
President Gustave Leven said officials ``don't want the least
doubt, as minimal as it might be, to weigh on the image of the
quality and purity of our product.'' Officials estimated the recall
will cost the company $35 million.
   Earlier this week, 72 million bottles of Perrier were withdrawn
from the U.S. market after benzene was detected in tests by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The recall was extended to
Canada, and a Japanese subsidiary said it would withdraw Perrier
from stores.
   Traces were also found earlier this week in samples from Denmark
and the Netherlands, prompting a recall there. Perrier's
distributor in Australia today ordered the recall of 40,000 cases.
   Leven told a news conference Wednesday that the company halted
distribution because ``half-measures were not possible.''
   Managing Director Frederik Zimmer said the benzene had passed
through a dirty filter and made it into some shipments.
   Benzene, a naturally occuring toxic chemical used in solvents,
entered the water in trace amounts when workers failed to change a
pipe filter at Perrier's natural spring at Vergeze in southern
France, company officials said.
   Perrier had known about the filter since Sunday but had waited
to assemble all the facts before publicizing the findings, Zimmer
said.
   French securities regulators, meanwhile, launched an
investigation into recent trading of Perrier stock.
   A spokeswoman for the Commission des Operations de Bourse said
the probe will attempt to determine whether insider trading took
place prior to the announcement the mineral water would be pulled
from shelves in North America.
   No indications have surfaced that insider trading took place,
the spokeswoman said, but she noted that options volume on the
company's shares was unusually high on Friday.
   Zimmer said the company is advising importers to to dump about
160 million bottles of the water on site and return the green
bottles to the company for cleaning and refilling.
   Distribution should return to normal within three months, Zimmer
said, with the new bottles showing the date they were filled.
Computer-controlled instruments will measure water purity to
prevent a benzene recurrence.
   The company will not issue a general recall in its home country
after a preliminary ruling by Health Ministry officials that it
poses no public danger, Leven said.
   French distributors will decide independently whether to pull
Perrier off the shelves and ask the company for fresh shipments,
Leven said.
   Zimmer ruled out industrial espionage and said disciplinary
action has been taken against the workers involved. He didn't
elaborate.
   The water and the natural carbon dioxide gas that makes it
bubbly are normally separated underground then carried up separate
pipes to the bottling facility, Zimmer said.
   A filter on the gas pipe that cleans out benzene and other
impurities had not been changed in ``several months,'' Zimmer said,
which caused a malfunctioning and allowed benzene to seep through.
   ``We don't know exactly how long the filter had been there,
that's the problem,'' said Zimmer. ``It was complete negligence.''
   Toxicologists from the University of Clermont-Ferrand said that
the amount of benzene found in samples it tested would pose a
cancer threat only if consumers drank a liter per day for life.
   The samples exceeded U.S. standards of 5 parts per billion and
European standards of 10 parts per billion, Zimmer said.

   Residents in the capital of Tadzhikistan formed
civil defense groups and set up barricades to protect themselves
from rioters who have terrorized the city for three days, Soviet
media reports said today.
   Bread was in short supply because hooligans were looting supply
trucks and people were unable to go to work because of the
barricades, lack of public transportation and threats from
militants, the daily Rabochaya Tribuna wrote.
   But the capital was reportedly quiet today, one day after three
senior officials in the republic resigned. The resignations had
been demanded by protesters unhappy about joblessness and rumors
that ethnic Armenian refugees were being given preferential
treatment for housing.
   Officials denied Soviet TV reports that 37 people had been
killed in the violence in Tadzhikistan, which borders Afghanistan
and China. The Tadzhik Interior Ministry and Tass reported today
that seven more deaths had brought the toll to 18 dead and 200
injured.
   The republic is the latest of several to be torn by ethnic
strife since President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to power five
years ago. He has repeatedly said the turmoil threatens his reform
program and has had to send troops to put down uprisings in several
republics, including Tadzhikistan.
   An editor of the state-run television station in Dushanbe, which
has been plagued by riots for three days, said Wednesday night
passed without incident.
   The editor, who declined to give his name, said some factories
are working, public transport is operating partially and
self-defense units built barricades in the suburbs. Rabochaya
Tribuna said the units are trying to protect themselves ``from
pogroms.''
   A spokesman for the republic's Interior Ministry, which
supervises the police and internal security forces, said today that
bread was being sold but that lines of customers are very long.
   The army daily Krasnaya Zvezda said today that hoodlums had
ransacked a hospital, ravaging the emergency room and destroying
expensive foreign-made equipment.
   On Wednesday, Tass said villagers threw firebombs and acid at
troops protecting the Communist Party headquarters in Dushanbe, and
about 5,000 young men looted, set fires and attacked passers-by
``irrespective of nationality.''
   The republic's president, premier and Communist Party chief
agreed to resign during a meeting of party leaders and activists,
who are protesting housing shortages and the arrival of Armenian
refugees, said Orif Aminov of the Tadzhik branch of the state
television and radio agency.
   Rabochaya Tribuna said the activists demand measures to combat
unemployment. From 70,000-200,000 of the republic's 5 million
people are unemployed, it said.
   The newspaper said, without elaborating, that the activists also
demand resolution of youth problems and a ban on the sale of pork,
which Moslems, the predominant group in the republic, do not eat.
The activists also are pressing language demands, but Rabochaya
Tribuna did not detail them.
   More troops landed in Dushanbe, the capital, on Wednesday to
guard strategic points and restore order, Tass said. Soviet TV
showed hundreds of people facing a wall of troops carrying riot
shields with a barren stretch of street between the two tense
groups.
   The violence began Monday after rumors spread that ethnic
Armenians fleeing persecution in the Azerbaijan republic were being
moved into the Tadzhik republic, where housing is scarce.
   Dushanbe-based journalist Anatoly Larenok said the crowd outside
Communist headquarters demanded that victims of the three days of
violence be buried in the central square.

   With her historical origins unveiled,
Cinderella started living happily ever after with a prince in a
business suit and a missing glass slipper that turned out to be
made of plastic.
   A hilarious courtroom reunion between the hard-working fairy
tale wench and her suitor occurred during a just-for-fun court
session Wednesday to determine the origin of the classic story.
   The ``trial'' featured theories that Walt Disney had created
Cinderella to brainwash American women, and claims the Cinderella
marketed by Disney had appeared earlier in France, Italy, and ninth
century China.
   But the height of the courtroom drama came when attorney Frank
Winston jumped from his chair, waving a clear, high-heeled
sling-back.
   ``I think I have it! I think I have it!'' Winston exclaimed, and
dashing to the witness stand where Cinderella was testifying, he
slipped the shoe on her foot.
   ``Oh! Someday my prince will come!'' said Cinderella, alias
Municipal Judge Diane Elan Wick, who wore a blond wig, patched
dress, clogs and carried a basket with three stuffed mice.
   Municipal Judge George T. Choppelas ruled that while the tale
that has delighted children all over the world stems from the 17th
century story by French lawyer and writer Charles Perrault, Walt
Disney deserves credit as a folklorist for the American version.
   ``Perrault took the oral tradition and he changed it, he adapted
it to the times,'' Choppelas said at the 61st session of the Court
of Historical Review and Appeals. ``Disney took the written version
and made it an animated film. ... He changed it around just like
Perrault.''
   Representing the United States and Walt Disney was San Francisco
Supervisor Wendy Nelder, who termed Cinderella ``the typical
American rags-to-riches story.''
   Jo Anne Miller, vice president of the San Francisco Board of
Education, testified that the 1950 Disney film was a part of a
sinister plot to get women out of shipyards and factories and back
behind the stove and ironing board after World War II.
   ``We were told that only when the prince comes will you life
change. And of course, it doesn't,'' she said.
   Glass, or at least clear plastic, slippers also are American,
argued Nelder, who reminisced with Miller about the shoes they wore
as adolescents.
   ``They were great because you could clean them with Windex,''
Miller said. ``The last thing I have to say is if the shoe fits,
wear it.''
   Winston, while keeping his royal origins secret, called
witnesses to support his arguments that Cinderella didn't come from
Hollywood.
   ``We go back to 400 B.C. _ before Cinderella,'' he quipped.
   In ninth century Chinese stories, the heroine transforms herself
into a beauty with the bones of a dead fish. In a Neapolitan
version, Zezolla is an abused child who mrders her evil stepmother
only to be saddled with another.
   Gerald F. Uelmen, dean of the School of Law at Santa Clara
University, said most of the now-essential elements of the fairy
tale _ including the pumpkin turned into a coach and mice changed
into horses _ first appeared in Perrault's story, ``Cendrillon,''
published in the 1697 collection ``Tales of Mother Goose.''

<HEAD>Former Kentucky Fried Chicken Owner and Founder of Hospital Chain
Dies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on financial wire.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jack C. Massey, who helped build
Kentucky Fried Chicken Co. into an international success and
co-founded Hospital Corporation of America, died today of
pneumonia. He was 85.
   Massey died at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla, said
Mimi Scruggs, his secretary at Massey Investment Co. in Nashville.
Massey, who retired from the company in 1978, had been staying at
his winter home in Florida.
   From a chain of six drugstores, the Nashville businessman
founded Massey Surgical Supply Inc. in 1930. He sold that company
for about $1 million in 1961 with the intention of retiring but
soon found himself in other business ventures.
   In 1964 Massey and businessman John Y. Brown, who later became
governor of Kentucky, bought Kentucky Fried Chicken from its
founder, Col. Harland Sanders. The two built the company into the
world's largest commercial marketer of prepared food. They sold the
business to the Heublein Corp. in 1969.
   Massey founded HCA with Dr. Thomas F. Frist, and his son, Dr.
Thomas Frist Jr., in 1968. Within 18 months the company had 11
hospitals, and within 10 years had reached $1 billion in sales and
was country's largest owner and operator of hospitals.
   HCA had acquired more than 420 hospitals by the mid-1980s. It
has sold many, but still owns or operates 150 and is the country's
largest hospital management company, with revenues of about $4.5
billion. HCA management took the company private last year in a $6
billion leveraged buyout.
   ``He was a titan of a contributor to many causes, including
Belmont College (in Nashville) and the Tennessee Performing Arts
Center,'' Brownlee O. Currey II, chairman of the Nashville Banner,
said when he learned of Massey's death.
   Massey is survived by his wife, Alyne Queener Massey; a
daughter, Barbara Massey Clark, and three grandchildren. Funeral
services were scheduled for Saturday at Immanuel Baptist Church in
Nashville.

   Massachusetts Institute of Technology
biologist Phillip A. Sharp has been nominated to become MIT's 15th
president, a school spokesman said today.
   The final vote on Sharp's nomination will be taken March 2 by
the 96-member MIT Corporation, which governs the school. He was
nominated by a faculty search committee, a faculty advisory
committee and the MIT Corporation's executive committee.
   MIT spokesman Bob D'Iorio confirmed published reports of Sharp's
nomination this morning.
   Sharp, the director of the university's center for cancer
research, would be the first biologist to head MIT. His 1977
discoveries about DNA are credited with dramatically changing the
field of molecular genetics.
   Paul E. Gray, who has been MIT president since 1980, said last
year that he would step down as of this summer.
   Robert M. Solow, the Noble laureate in economics who headed the
faculty advisory committee, called Sharp ``a superb scientist, a
real ornament to MIT.''
   Sharp, 45, joined the MIT faculty in 1974 as an associate
professor of biology in the center for cancer research. He became
director of the center in 1985.

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Tehran newspaper Thursday called on
Britain to apologize to world Moslems for protecting British author
Salman Rushdie from a year-old Iranian death sentence.
   The daily Jomhuri Islami also said the British government should
condemn Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' as blasphemous
against Islam and hand over the Indian-born writer for execution.
   On Wednesday, Iranians celebrated the first anniversary of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's Feb. 14 ruling that Rushdie should be
killed for writing the novel.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted
the Farsi-language Jomhuri Islami as saying London could
``disentangle'' itself from the present controversy over Rushdie.
   This could be done ``by offering an apology to the Moslem world
for its past behavior in that connection, by condemning `The
Satanic Verses' and writer Salman Rushie and by surrendering him to
world Moslems,'' it said.
   Jomhuri Islami is considered aligned with the ``radical''
faction in Iran, which advocates preserving the purity of the
Islamic Revolution and opposes renewing contacts with the West.
   The Iranians have condemned London for not handing over Rushdie,
who is in hiding in Britain under police guard.
   Iranian Parliament Speaker Mahdi Karrubi said Wednesday that
``however much Salman Rushdie may be kept under guard, eventually a
Moslem will carry out the edict.''
   All 12 members of the European Economic Community briefly
recalled their ambassadors from Tehran last year to protest the
death sentence on Rushdie. Iran's relations were later normalized
with all the countries except Britain.

   Italian authorities posted avalanche
warnings throughout the South Tyrol region of northern Italy on
Thursday after nearly six feet of snow fell.
   Police said about 40 tourists were blocked by snow and strong
winds in one hotel.
   A huge snowslide shortly after dawn in the Venosta valley
damaged a chairlift and a restaurant at San Valentino alla Muta.
Police said nobody was hurt.
   Snow slowed down traffic along the Brenner highway and long
lines of trucks formed at Campo Trens, near the Italian-Austrian
border.
   Authorities in Bolzano said an avalanche hazard was likely to
continue for several days as a result of an expected rise in
temperatures, which would result in ground not frozen hard enough
to support the new snow.
   The snow that fell this week ended a long dry spell that had
hurt Italy's winter tourism industry.
   In the Alps of neighboring France, which also received heavy
snow recently, four people died in avalanches in the past two days.
   The victims were identified Thursday as skiers from Britain and
France, who died in avalanches in southeastern France. One victim,
a 17-year-old woman, was killed when an avalanche swept her car
from the road leading to the ski resort of Les Arc.
   Three other people were seriously injured when their cars were
swept off the road in the same incident Wednesday.

   A navy helicopter was used to
rescue 33 crewmen from an oil rig Thursday after it broke loose
from its anchor in heavy seas. The rig ran aground later, but
officials said it did not threaten the environment.
   Nobody was injured in the rescue operation, a Dutch coast guard
spokesman said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The rig ran aground late Thursday afternoon at Europoort,
Rotterdam's seaside deepwater port, the spokesman said. He said
attempts to get it floating again would be made during the next
high tide.
   The Dutch-owned Gilbert Rowe was anchored 11 miles west of Hook
of Holland when it got into trouble, according to the spokesman. A
Dutch navy helicopter picked up the crew while the rig was being
blown in the direction of the Dutch coast.

   A prisoner who starved himself for nearly a year
to proclaim he was innocent of drug charges feasted on soda
crackers, cheese and freedom after the Michigan Court of Appeals
ordered him released.
   Rene Acuna, 37, who had vowed not to eat until he returned home,
began trying to rebuild his health and his life after the court
wiped out a $100,000 appeal bond and set him free Tuesday evening.
   ``I am here and I don't believe it,'' he said Wednesday as he
sat on his living room couch with his daughter, Nuria, 2.
   The Cuban immigrant was convicted March 3, 1989, in Macomb
County Circuit Court of delivery and conspiracy to deliver more
than 2 pounds of cocaine.
   He was given two mandatory life sentences without parole and
began his hunger strike a short time later, subsisting on water and
coffee with sugar. He was force-fed for a time last fall and again
Monday and Tuesday when prison doctors concluded his life was in
danger.
   Prosecutors claim Acuna was a lookout for drug dealers, but
Acuna insists he was arrested in August 1988 only because he was a
Hispanic in a white neighborhood when undercover agents bought
drugs from other Hispanics.
   The appeals court overturned the convictions for lack of
evidence Jan. 23, but an appeal bond of $100,000 still stood. Acuna
continued to serve his sentences until this week when the appeals
court reduced his bond.
   Prosecutors are appealing to the state Supreme Court to get his
convictions reinstated. But Acuna said he believes the state
Supreme Court will uphold the appeals court's decision to throw the
convictions out.
   ``I have something inside my soul,'' Acuna said. ``When I pray
(to) God, I listened to the voice of God say, `You will be free. Be
patient, You will be free. I know that you are innocent. I am
here.'''
   ``I can't blame the American justice system, no. I can blame
some persons who represented the American justice system in the
wrong way.''
   Carole Murray, chief of the drug unit in the Macomb County
prosecutor's office, said after Acuna's release, ``My only comment
is I'm sorry to see that.''
   Murray said Macomb County prosecutors still believe there was
ample evidence to convict Acuna and his bond should have been
retained at $100,000 to prevent him from fleeing.
   ``There's always a concern when you have a large penalty that a
defendant is facing,'' she said.
   Acuna's face was gaunt, his cheeks sunken and his hair, which
had begun to fall out, had been shaved off. His weight was down
from 180 to about 105.
   ``I am happy, I am nervous. I feel like running. I feel several
emotions at the same time,'' he said.
   His lawyers marveled at Acuna's stamina during his 11-month
hunger strike.
   ``This guy is the most courageous person I've ever met,'' said
Paul Denenfeld, legal director for the Michigan chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   Denenfeld said Acuna's convictions and the mandatory life
sentences were symptoms of American hysteria over drugs.
   ``I never expected him to live to see his case reversed,'' said
Michael Schuck, attorney with the State Appellate Defender's
Office. ``It's extraordinary. He survived a good six months on pure
guts and the knowledge that he was innocent.''
   The longest hunger strike ever, according to the Guinness Book
of World Records, is a 385-day strike in 1972-73 staged by an
Englishman who said he was wrongly charged with rape. Like Acuna,
that man was force-fed by tube.

<TEXT>
   A suspect in a McDonald's holdup has
been charged with the murder of his three alleged accomplices even
though it was police who shot and killed them.
   In the rare application of state law, Alfredo Olivas, 19, of
Hollywood, was charged Wednesday with three counts of murder and
one of robbery in the holdup and shootout. He could face the death
penalty or life in prison without parole.
   State law allows a person participating in a crime in which
someone is killed to be charged with murder.
   ``It's somewhat different, but he can be charged and was charged
on a theory of vicarious liability,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Kenneth Barshop. ``I haven't seen it happen very often.''
   Police investigating a string of nine fast-food restaurant
robberies had followed Olivas and three other men to the McDonald's
Monday. While officers waited, the restaurant was robbed up of
several thousand dollars and its manager was tied up.
   Officers reported seeing one robber holding what appeared to be
a pistol and two others apparently reaching for something, and a
shootout began. Police said they fired 23 shotgun blasts and 12
.45-caliber pistol rounds.
   Olivas remained hospitalized in serious condition with gunshot
wounds.

<TEXT>
   Not even the prospect of a place to
frolic in the nude is luring buyers to a proposed condominium
project in Connecticut's slumping real estate market.
   PST Corp. of Westport tried to draw customers to its 42-unit Oak
Hill Condominium by offering a ``clothing optional'' recreation
area consisting of a clubhouse, sauna, pool and hot tub.
   ``You have to be creative in a slow market, but this idea is
dead,'' said Douglas Nelkin, a marketing consultant on the project.
   The complex would have been the first of its kind in New
England, although they are popular in California and some Southern
states, Nelkin said.
   PST has an option on the land and was trying to drum up interest
in condos selling for $179,000 to $199,000.
   Nelkin said about 1,000 brochures were sent to ``naturalist''
associations. ``Most people said it was a good idea, but they
weren't in the market for a new home,'' he said.

<HEAD>Florida Supreme Court Upholds Turtle Excluder Device Rule for
State Waters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court today
unanimously upheld a state rule requiring shrimp fishermen in
Florida waters to use devices designed to keep sea turtles from
getting killed in their nets.
   Turtle excluder devices are like trap doors that let sea
turtles, which need to surface to breathe, escape drowning in
shrimp nets. Some shrimpers argue that TEDs also let enough shrimp
out to put them out of business.
   The rule was approved by Gov. Bob Martinez and the Cabinet in
August as an emergency measure to help save endangered species of
sea turtles. The temporary rule the court reviewed expired last
week, but the governor and Cabinet also have approved a permanent
rule requiring the use of TEDs.
   The challenge to the state rule was brought by David Davis, the
first shrimper cited under it. He argued that the Florida Marine
Fisheries Commission had overstepped its authority in writing the
measure and that the state Legislature was the only body that could
properly make such rules.
   A Franklin County judge agreed with Davis on Nov. 27 and found
the rule invalid. The state appealed to the 1st District Court of
Appeal, which labeled the issue one of ``great public importance''
and passed it along to the state's high court.
   Charles Shelfer, general counsel for the state fisheries
commission, said officials will seek to have challenges to the
permanent rule thrown out as a result of today's decision.
   ``We are very pleased and feel in some respect vindicated by the
Supreme Court action,'' he said, adding that ``for Florida, this
pretty much settles it.''
   The federal government also has rules requiring shrimpers to use
TEDs, but Shelfer said that unlike the federal rules, the Florida
rule would require the use of TEDs year-round in all parts of
Florida. The federal rules require TEDs year-round in some Florida
waters, but only in certain seasons in other areas off Florida.
   Davis still faces trial on the charge, punishable by up to 60
days in jail and a $500 fine.
   ``I disagree with that, but they're the Supreme Court,'' said J.
Patrick Floyd, an attorney for Davis.
   ``I'm surprised and very disappointed because it appeared clear
that the marine fisheries commission's power does not include
dealing with endangered species,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush held security-shrouded
summit talks today with leaders of Latin America's three major
cocaine-producing nations, hoping for a ``fruitful and productive
exchange'' on intensifying their war against drugs.
   ``We shall move forward in spite of the sacrifices that we have
had to take,'' declared Colombian President Virgilio Barco, who
welcomed Bush and the presidents of Peru and Bolivia to the summit
site at a heavily guarded naval base.
   ``No, we will not weaken, we will not let the deaths of
thousands of Colombians be in vain,'' said Barco, whose country has
been ravaged by bombings, assassinations and other violence from
drug lords and leftist guerrillas.
   At midmorning, the four leaders strolled briefly in 85-degree
heat along the shore of Cartagena Bay, admiring the panoramic
skyline of the sun-drenched city in the distance, before they
entered the rugged old stone Fort Manzanillo to begin their talks.
   Moments before Air Force One landed safely in Colombia, Bush
told reporters that ``it's going to be a good meeting ... because
it's four countries cooperating in the fight against drugs.''
   Security was extraordinarily tight around the summit site.
Patrol boats sped along the shore with machine guns pointed inland,
and a Colombian frigate was stationed just off the peninsula.
Across Cartagena Bay, the wharves were empty, and the streets of
this resort city _ normally backed with traffic and pedestrians _
were virtually abandoned.
   Bush arrived in a swarm of five helicopters, possibly to thwart
the possibility of an attack. Later, while standing next to Barco,
Bush was asked if he were afraid. ``Afraid of what?'' he replied.
``Absolutely not, absolutely not.''
   In a statement issued after his arrival, Bush said the summit
would produce ``a broad, flexible framework which will guide the
actions'' of the four hemispheric countries in their battle against
drug traffickers.
   Barco said there was a need to provide ``viable economic
alternatives'' to those who grow coca plants _ the raw material for
cocaine. ``The only law that the narco-terrorists do not break is
the law of supply and demand,'' the Colombian president said.
   Before he left Washington at dawn _ after a night's sleep aboard
Air Force One parked in a hangar _ Bush said in a published
interview that the drug summit's success will be measured by a
reduction in cocaine production, and ``that's going to take some
time.''
   During the 4{-hour flight to Colombia, Bush refused comment on
an NBC report that Barco had promised not to extradite drug lords
to the United States if they agreed to turn their cocaine
laboratories over to the Bogota government.
   Bush landed without incident at the Caribbean port city of
Barranquilla and flew 60 miles southwest by helicopter with a small
group of top aides to a restored 17th century fort in Cartagena
where the six-hour summit took place.
   At Cartagena, Bush walked down a red carpet with Barco and shook
hands with his other summit partners, Presidents Jaime Paz Zamora
of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peru, who was accompanied to
Cartagena _ but not the summit talks _ by two coca producers whom
he invited along as observers.
   U.S. warships patrolled offshore and 5,000 Colombian troops
provided security for the summiteers. Bush pronounded the U.S.
security arrangements as ``first class. We've got the best, the
best.''
   Arriving in Cartagena, Garcia said he would seek a new era of
hemispheric cooperation in the drug war. ``We have come to make up
for lost time,'' he said.
   A Colombian radio report said police were investigating the
early morning explosion of an electrical transformer near the
Cartagena airport, which reportedly was left without electricity.
Such incidents occur occasionally in Colombia because of power
surges.
   The Latin-American leaders planned to seek expanded U.S.
economic aid to ease their farmers' shift from lucrative coca
plants _ used to produce cocaine _ to growing legal crops. But
White House officials hinted that any new U.S. offer would be
modest.
   One plan reportedly would include $30 million in assistance,
including technical advice from visiting U.S. teams of agricultural
experts. ``We don't have unlimited resources,'' said White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   In an interview published in today's editions of the newspaper
USA Today, Bush said reducing U.S. demand for drugs _ the strategy
stressed by the Andean nations _ was only part of the problem.
   As for coca-growing farmers in Colombia or Peru, Bush had this
advice: ``Grow another crop. Grow one that has a useful purpose and
not an immoral purpose in the world.''
   Some strains were evident before the summit began. Garcia had
threatened to boycott in protest of the U.S. invasion of Panama,
then invited a group of coca growers to attend with him, and
ultimately delayed his arrival until today. The Colombian and
Bolivian presidents arrived Wednesday.
   The Bush administration has said it will ask Congress to approve
$2.2 billion in aid to the three countries through 1995 to help
them fight drug traffickers, including a $206 million increase for
next year.
   ``Coca reduction in exchange for development _ that is our
premise,'' Paz Zamora said earlier this week.
   Garcia was quoted this week as saying ``massive economic
resources are needed'' to switch crops because coca ``is enormously
important to our economy.''
   The four leaders planned to issue a joint statement following
the meeting that officials said would include a U.S. pledge to help
track illegal export of U.S.-made firearms and crack down on
drug-related chemical shipments.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas E. McNamara said both the United States
and Colombia must act more aggressively to halt the flow into
Colombia of U.S. semi-automatic weapons, which are favored by drug
traffickers.
   ``I think we can do more to control the export of firearms and
Cololmbia can do more to monitor imports,'' McNamara told reporters
in remarks that appeared to conflict with Bush's opposition to
tighter export controls on such weapons.
   Two U.S. warships were cruising along Colombia's coast while
Colombian patrol boats, a Colombian submarine and a frigate were in
Cartagena Bay. Helicopter gunships flew continually over the
meeting site, and Colombian marines searched vehicles at roadblocks.
   Nonetheless, Bush was traveling with a sharply reduced staff
because of concerns for his safety, Fitzwater said. The purpose was
``to eliminate any excess personnel and for security reasons, to
simply not have any more people there than is absolutely
necessary,'' he said.
   In December, there was a report that Colombian drug lords had
taken a $30 million contract on Bush's life.
   Bush's visit was denounced Wednesday by Colombia's four main
labor federations, which condemned the U.S. invasion of Panama.
Workers marched in Bogota, the capital, and Medelin, home of the
powerful Colombian drug cartel.
   Meanwhile, two U.S. citizens remained in the hands of leftist
guerrillas who kidnapped them in the drug capital of Medellin on
Tuesday to protest the Bush visit.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson
submitted the resignation of his Social Democratic government today
after losing a vote in Parliament over an economic rescue bill.
   Five opposition parties, from communists to conservatives,
united to kill the plan calling for a two-year freeze on wages and
prices and restrictions on strikes. The government proposed the
bill to quell escalating wage demands and labor strife.
   The vote was 190-153 endorsing a committee resolution to reject
the government's plan. Six members were absent.
   Immediately following the vote Carlsson went to the chamber of
Speaker Thage G. Peterson to hand in his resignation, Swedish Radio
and the national news agency TT reported.
   The resignation set off what could be an extended period of
haggling to create a new government. If unsuccessful, an early
election will be required.
   Commentators said Carlsson was the only politician capable of
forming a new government, since his Social Democrats and Communists
together could block any non-socialist coalition.
   In an earlier speech, Carlsson said his plan was intended to
guarantee continued full employment, ``the basis of a fair
society.''
   ``If the five opposition parties together reject the Social
Democratic proposals, then Mr. Speaker, the government will
resign,'' Carlsson had said, winning applause from the packed
chamber and the spectators' gallery.
   The vote came after several hours of debate.
   All opposition parties said they objected to the measures. ``We
happily reject these proposals, which no one believes in,'' said
Carl Bildt, leader of the center-right Moderate party, daring
Carlsson to call an immediate election.
   Carlsson would remain head of a caretaker government while
Peterson consulted on the formation of another government.
   The assignment could be given to a coalition of center-right
opposition parties or Carlsson, himself, could be asked to try
again.
   If no one succeeded, an election would be called 35 to 90 days
after efforts broke down. The next scheduled election is in
September 1991.
   The Social Democrats, who have governed Sweden for 51 of the
last 58 years, unveiled the wage-price freeze last week to suppress
a convulsion of strikes.
   All Sweden's banks have been closed for nearly three weeks,
drying up retail business and threatening major industries with
liquidity and supply problems.
   A potentially crippling strike of pre-school teachers, nurses
and other municipal employees was suspended until next week.
   Carlsson said the labor chaos was throwing the economy off
balance, adding that Sweden cannot afford to meet the wage demands.
Salaries rose 28 percent over the last three years, while
production grew an average 2 percent, he said.
   The measures were designed to curb an inflation rate heading
toward 9 percent, about double the European average. Economists
have blamed the low unemployment of just over 1 percent for adding
inflationary pressures.
   Carlsson said the opposition is so splintered that Sweden's
economic crisis would be compounded by a political crisis if the
Social Democrats were forced out of office.
   ``A political crisis might be created that leads to paralysis,
uncertainty and insecurity, and that is the last thing Sweden needs
today,'' he said.
   The Social Democrats control 156 seats in the 349-member
Riksdag, usually working in cooperation with the 20-seat Communist
Party.
   The three center-right parties have a total of 152 seats, and
the balance is held by the Environment Party.

   A man stabbed his mother 24 times with a
butcher knife and then watched television as she lay dying on the
bathroom floor, pleading with him to call an ambulance, police said.
   Lawrexen W. Jones, 23, then left the house but returned at least
four times to see if she had died and to pick up some clothes,
Sheriff Allen Sloan said.
   ``This is the most heartless killing I've ever seen,'' Sloan
said.
   Jones was charged with murder Wednesday in the slaying of his
mother, Thomasina, 54. He was being held without bail.
   Mrs. Jones' body was found Tuesday in the bathroom of the home
she shared with her son. She was stabbed Feb. 8 after arguing with
him over unpaid bills, Sloan said.
   ``He dragged her into the bathroom, and she begged him to call
an ambulance,'' Sloan said. ``He went into the living room, turned
on the TV and debated for about 10 minutes whether to call the
ambulance.
   ``Then he got up, shut the bathroom door, pushed a dresser in
front of the door,'' the sheriff said. ``He cleaned off the butcher
knife, put it back in the kitchen and took off in her car.''
   Mrs. Jones' body was found by her estranged husband, Willie, and
a friend who went to the house after she failed to show up for work.
   Jones said his son had been in trouble several times over the
years, mostly for running up bills on Mrs. Jones' credit cards.

   Barbara Bush had a small cancerous growth
removed from her upper lip on Wednesday, her press office announced
today.
   ``No side effects or subsequent difficulties are expected,'' it
said in announcing the operation.
   She underwent the outpatient procedure at Bethesda Naval
Hospital in Maryland.
   Mrs. Bush was in New York today, visiting All Children's House,
a day care center for homeless children and other youths.
   In a one-paragraph statement, her press office said:
   ``At Bethesda Naval Hospital on Feb. 14, Mrs. Bush underwent a
routine outpatient medical procedure to remove a small basal cell
carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, from her upper lip. The
procedure was performed under local anesthesia by Bethesda's chief
of dermatology, Dr. Harry Parlette. No side effects or subsequent
difficulties are expected.''
   Mrs. Bush recently underwent radiation treatment for a
persistent eye problem stemming from a condition known as Graves
disease, which also had affected her thyroid.
   Jean Becker, a deputy press secretary, said the cancer was
discovered about a week ago. She was not sure whether Mrs. Bush had
undergone the same procedure in the past.
   Basal cell carcinomas are common skin cancers that occur most
often on the face or on other skin areas that have been exposed to
the sun. Light-skinned people, such as Mrs. Bush, are most
susceptible.
   The cancer grows slowly, usually is easily removed surgically
and only rarely re-occurs at the same site.

   A mother of four and her boyfriend were sentenced
today to life in prison for the torture-slaying of the woman's
4-year-old son and the beating of his brother, both of whom were
hung upside down in closets for hours.
   Alicia Abraham, 28, and Johnny Campbell, 40, were sentenced by
Cook County Circuit Judge Michael B. Getty, who had called the case
``the most heinous, brutally sadistic torture and murder ... that I
have ever heard in my 6{ years as a judge, my over 10 years as a
prosecutor, or indeed my 51 years on this Earth.''
   In sentencing them today to life imprisonment with no chance of
parole, Getty said Campbell is mentally ill and Ms. Abraham had not
participated directly in the death of her son, making them
ineligible for the death penalty.
   Assistant Cook County State's Attorney James Bigoness had argued
that death by lethal injection ``is the only, only just sentence''
for both defendants.
   Defense attorneys acknowledged the crimes were horrible, but
urged the judge to spare their clients' lives.
   Campbell's attorney, Allan Sincox, said Campbell is psychotic
and argued that sentencing him to death would be ``cruel and
unusual punishment.''
   Clyde Lemons Jr., Ms. Abraham's attorney, said she ``never
committed any of the acts'' that led to Lattie McGee's death.
   Lattie was starved, burned with a hot iron, stuck with pins and
needles, singed with cigarettes, beaten with a tree branch, hair
brush, belt and hands, scalded with steaming water, and tied up
with a clothesline, rope and tights for 2{ months in the family's
South Side apartment during the summer of 1987, court records
showed.
   A severe blow to his head on Aug. 14, 1987, was the eventual
cause of death, a pathologist from the county medical examiner's
office testified.
   Lattie's 8-year-old brother, Cornelius Abraham, testified that
Campbell had twice tied him up with a rope and hung him upside down
in the closet, once for two days.
   Cornelius said Campbell had taken a hot iron and ``put it on my
brother's chest and he put that iron on my butt.''
   The boy said his mother was ``in the living room watching TV''
at the time.
   He told of seeing Campbell tie Lattie's wrists to his ankles and
hang him upside down in the closet. Once, Cornelius said, his
mother helped tie up Lattie.
   Campbell, a Vietnam veteran, ex-steel worker and heavy drug and
alcohol user, pleaded guilty in December to first-degree murder and
aggravated battery. He said he beat the boys to curb what he
thought was homosexual behavior.
   Ms. Abraham pleaded innocent, contending that she never actively
abused the children.
   But prosecutors said she never tried to stop Campbell, and Getty
convicted her of the same charges Jan. 11.
   ``There can be no question that when a mother puts her child
into an alligator pit that the mother has condemned that child to
death,'' the judge said.
   The boys' father, Lattie McGee Sr., has custody of Cornelius.
Ms. Abraham's other two children, by another man, now live with
their paternal grandmother.

<TEXT>
   A couple who lost custody of their four
children for spanking them have been reunited with three of the
youngsters.
   Their two sons, 9 and 7, were returned to Stephen and Joann
DeCosta on Wednesday, six months after the four children were put
in foster care in a case that raised questions about parents'
rights to discipline their children.
   ``It's wonderful,'' Joann DeCosta said. ``They were ear-to-ear
grins.''
   The DeCostas regained custody of their youngest daughter, 3,

   Their oldest child, a 14-year-old, has not been reunited with
the family. She testified against her parents at hearings on
whether the children had been disciplined too harshly.
   After closed hearings, District Judge Edwin Kelly had affirmed
the removal of the children, ruling that the DeCostas had abused
them by frequently spanking them with paddles, switches and dowels.
   The DeCostas insist that the spankings were administered with
love in accordance with their Christian beliefs and that
authorities interferred with their rights to discipline their
children.

<TEXT>
   A senior NATO official suggested
Thursday that a united Germany remain in the alliance, but with
both Soviet and Western military forces stationed in its territory.
   The remarks by Henning Wegener, assistant NATO secretary-general
for political affairs, rankled a visiting delegation of Soviet
legislators.
   Valentin Falin, head of the Soviet delegation, proposed in
response that the Germanys be reunited within the Warsaw Pact and
asked Wegener, a West German: ``How would you like that?''
   The Soviet Union wants a future German state to be neutral, but
the United States and its allies want the reunified country in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``A united Germany should not only firmly remain in NATO as a
full member, but there must also be reassuring arrangements for
Soviet and East European security interests,'' Wegener told a
conference sponsored by the North Atlantic Assembly, made up of
legislators from the 16 NATO nations.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany has
proposed NATO membership for a single Germany, but with only West
German territory tied to its military structure and no NATO forces
in what is now East Germany.
   Wegener said officials of the Western alliance ``can very much
imagine a transitional model _ where the transition times could be
long _ of dual stationing of forces in the two halves of Germany,
one belonging to the Soviet Union and the other to the NATO
alliance.''
   ``All of Germany would be politically part of NATO and none of
its parts belonging to the Warsaw Treaty Organization,'' he said.
   His suggestion prompted discussion in the Soviet delegation,
which included Gen. Vladimir Lobov, chief of the seven-nation
Warsaw Pact's general staff.
   Falin said later it was ``improper to think beforehand that you
will be better (at) reading our own interests than we are'' and
asked Wegener:
   ``Would you like this option? The Warsaw Treaty Organization
includes politically the entire united Germany and takes on a
commitment not to place its own military forces on the territory''
of West Germany.
   ``How would you like that?''
   Wegener replied: ``I challenge you: Put it to the test with the
German electorate'' in each country, ``and later on in both of them
together, and then let's see what comes out of it.''
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, the top NATO commander in Europe, said
earlier there was ``definitely precedent for a nation staying
within the North Atlantic Alliance under special considerations.''
   He did not mention possible arrangements for a united Germany,
but noted that some NATO members have special status.
   Spain and France refuse to link their forces to the joint
military structure.
   Norway, one of two NATO nations bordering the Soviet Union, is
in the military structure but does not allow foreign troops to be
stationed on its soil or let alliance forces conduct maneuvers in
the extreme north, near the Soviet frontier.
   No NATO forces are stationed in Turkey, the other member on the
Soviet border.
   ``The point is there are many different arrangements that have
been made,'' Galvin said. ``I don't think we should forget that.''

   Snow and ice spread from Southern California to New England
today, cutting electrical service to thousands in the Midwest,
threatening crops and closing a major highway across the deserts of
southeastern Arizona.
   Hundreds of schools were closed across the Midwest and some
motorists were stranded in parts of Michigan, where the state House
canceled today's session.
   Only three runways were open this morning at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport and hundreds of flights had been canceled
after the airport was shut down Wednesday by snow.
   Gale-force wind heaved much of what remained from a
400,000-gallon oil spill onto miles of Southern California beaches.
   Temperatures hit record lows today in northern California, where
a second storm out of the Gulf of Alaska was expected. Sacramento
hit a record 30 degrees.
   Cold along the West Coast drove hundreds of homeless people into
shelters in Los Angeles, and in Seattle, King County opened its
administration building as a refuge for the homeless.
   The bad weather made traveling treacherous, causing numerous
accidents in many states, and abandoned cars in Michigan slowed
plows and salt trucks. Slick roads were blamed for crashes that
killed a man in Missouri and four people in Kansas.
   An ice storm knocked out electricity to more than 146,000
customers today across a wide area of northern Ohio, although most
service was restored today. authorities said. At least 4,000
customers lost power in Illinois. Outages also were reported in
parts of Indiana.
   Schools were closed in dozens of counties across Wisconsin,
Michigan, Indiana, northern Ohio, Kansas and Missouri.
   Snow and ice forced the closure for 10 hours until late this
morning of about 110 miles of Interstate 10 across southeastern
Arizona, from the New Mexico border to 20 miles east of Tucson.
   On Wednesday, an American Airlines jet skidded off a runway at
O'Hare, blocking the only runway then open. None of the 158 people
aboard was injured.
   Drifts closed runways almost as fast as the plows could open
them, and at 7:30 p.m. the world's busiest airport was closed. A
few planes took off late at night and airport officials hoped to
have all runways open later today, despite freezing rain and sleet.
   Heavy snow overnight in Wisconsin closed Mitchell International
Airport in Milwaukee. Officials planned to reopen the airport later
in the day after drifts of up to a foot were plowed from runways.
   Snowfall totaled 8 to 10 inches in much of northern Illinois
before the precipitation changed to sleet and freezing rain.
Southern Wisconsin got 4 to 6 inches. Up to 8 inches fell on parts
of Michigan. In the Northeast, up to 6 inches fell across New York
state.
   Icy temperatures in southern California sent citrus and avocado
growers scurrying to keep crops from freezing.
   ``They're predicting temperatures in some areas will go down to
as low as 22 degrees,'' said Gail Hutchings, who with her husband
manages 250 acres in San Diego County's Pauma Valley. ``We never
see temperatures here this low.''
   Heavier snow in the Rockies _ as much as 2 feet _ was a blessing
for ski resorts heading into President's Day holiday weekend.
   ``The timing is fabulous,'' said Mike Smedley, spokesman for the
Purgatory ski resort in Colorado. ``It really looks like Colorado
should look. It looks like winter and it looks like ski country.''
   People who fled colder climes for places like Southern
California and Arizona were dismayed.
   ``It's cloudy, it's windy and it hasn't been this cold in a long
time,'' said Loretta Taylor in Apache Junction, Ariz., outside
Phoenix, which had a low today of 32. ``People can't believe they
came out here for this.''
   Snow fell Wednesday and today in Phoenix suburbs and in Tucson
and other places in southern Arizona, with as much as an inch of
accumulation.
   ``We didn't really expect to find snow and ice,'' said George
Gonperts of Southport, Conn., stuck with his wife and hundreds of
other motorists at a mountain pass on Interstate 5 about 50 miles
northwest of Los Angeles.
   Gonperts and his wife were celebrating their 25th wedding
anniversary with a trip to Mexico and California.
   ``Next year we're going to Honolulu,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in Southern California, wind gusting to gale force
strength of 39 mph kicked up heavy seas that heaved much of the oil
remaining from a 400,000-gallon spill Feb. 7 onto miles of beaches
in the Huntington Beach area.
   Cold drove hundreds of homeless people into shelters in Los
Angeles and the city opened at least eight extra shelters.
   There was a rare snowfall in sections of San Diego and some
outlying areas early Wednesday, while hail and snow fell in
metropolitan Los Angeles, though it melted on contact.

   At least two people drowned
Thursday and 50 were forced to leave their homes after heavy rain
and snow caused flooding in the southwestern state of
Baden-Wuerttemburg, police said.
   The storms hit the state near its borders with France and
Switzerland in the Black Forest region, flooding highways and
streets and causing landslides in the area's steep wine-growing
hills.
   Police in the town of Aalen reported that a 41-year-old woman
drowned after a gust of wind tore her umbrella out of her hand and
she fell into a flooded creek trying to retrieve it.
   In the Black Forest town of Trieberg, at least one man drowned
when he accidently drove his car into a swollen stream and the
vehicle was swept away. Police said the car had not been found as
of late Thursday and that two passengers might also have been in it
when it was washed away.
   In the nearby district of Waldshut-Tiegen, 50 people were
evacuated from their homes because of flooding and were taken to a
local gymnasium for shelter, district official Bernhard Wuetz said.
   The Alp, Wehra and Wutach streams, all tributaries of the Rhine
river, caused widespread flooding in the region, Wuetz said in a
statement released to the news media. Residents in some towns used
boats to get around, he said.
   According to police reports, damage in the area was estimated in
the millions of dollars, and more flooding was expected from
melting snow. The Rhine river was rising at a rate of about seven
inches per hour, police said.
   Police said that two companies of the army and some 600
volunteers and firefighters had been mobilized to help clear roads
and carry out rescue work.

   Fishermen and others whose
business depends on a beautiful coastline fear the oil spill that
is coating the beach with gooey Alaskan crude will cost them their
livelihood.
   ``There's a lot of people who are going to sue,'' said Dan
McCafferty of the Dory Fleet, a cooperative of 20 fisherman at
Newport Beach. ``It's ruined our business. The fishing here will
never be the same as it was.''
   McCafferty and several others plan to seek compensation from
British Petroleum America Inc., which owned the oil and chartered
the American Trader, and the tanker's owner, American Trading
Transportation Co.
   A class-action lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Los Angeles, seeking
compensation for damage and economic losses caused by the spill and
the alleged failure to properly clean up the oil. Among the
defendants named were British Petroleum and American Trading.
   Fish sales in the Huntington and Newport Beach areas have come
to a virtual halt since the American Trader spilled 400,000 gallons
of crude Feb. 7 as the tanker tried to moor about two miles
offshore.
   ``People heard about the oil spill and immediately assumed we
were fishing in the oil,'' said fisherman Matt Breneman, 22.
   ``We've had the freshest fish for years,'' said Mike Steven
Long, a linebaiter with Dory Fleet. ``Now our reputation is
ruined.''
   Oil had washed ashore and percolated as deep as 3 feet into the
sand by Wednesday along about a 12-mile stretch from Bolsa Chica
State Beach to Newport Beach, according to cleanup officials.
   ``It's a sad thing because there's these little sand turtles
that the birds eat, and they're all dead,'' said Ralph Gray, 27, in
Balboa, about 10 miles south of Huntington Beach.
   Volunteers and others had found 153 dead birds at last count,
and wildlife rescue workers were trying to save another 329 oiled
fowl, said Tom Paulek of the California Department of Fish and Game.
   By evening, no oil was visible to Coast Guard boats at sea, said
Newport Beach police Sgt. Andy Gonis, but a sheen was visible on
coastline breakers.
   Many feared that a week of closed beaches had caused
irreversible damage.
   ``I lost my $750-dollar apartment in Costa Mesa in just four
days,'' said Newport Beach linebaiter Mike Steven Long. ``Usually,
in that time, I make enough to pay my rent. Now I'm on the streets,
living here where I work.''
   Trips to Catalina and whale-watching excursions were halted as
access to the ocean was cut off.
   ``What happens if the beaches stay closed?'' asked real estate
agent Dinah Lewis. ``Are my customers going to get their money
back?''
   Business improved for some beachfront restaurants because of the
influx of wrk crews, journalists and officials.
   ``I feel sort of like a vulture because my fishermen friends are
suffering,'' said Mike Leigh, owner of the Newport Sea Shack. ``But
it's been real good for us.''
   Cleanup workers also were benefiting from the spill, making
about $10 an hour, and more at overtime rates.
   One man capitalizing on the spill was Larry Sakhrani, owner of
Michael's Surf and Sport in Huntington Beach. For $12.95 each,
Sakhrani was selling white T-shirts with bold black letters that
read: ``Crude is Rude, Dude.''

underwent two emergency operations at a Warsaw hospital to control
the bleeding.
   Glemp, archbishop of Warsaw and Gniezno since 1981, is spiritual

   One of the nation's largest manufacturers of
car cleaning products Thursday recalled about 200,000 cans of a new
car wax because the containers may rupture and cause injury.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Connecticut-based
SIMONIZ recalled its ``Quick Gloss'' car wax after three incidents
in which container corrosion caused a build-up of pressure that
ruptured the cans. No injuries were reported.
   However, CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said various parts, including
the metal dome, may separate from the container and cause injury.
   The agency said approximately 200,000 cans of ``Quick Gloss''
were sold nationwide since February 1989.
   Consumers should spray the wax into trash cans away from any
open flame and immediately dispose of the metal containers, the
CPSC said, warning consumers not to puncture, incinerate or use a
trash compactor in disposing of the cans.
   Consumers should call 1-800-243-6400 for information on how to
receive a refund.

   At least 14 deaths and more than 1,200 cases of a
rare, painful blood disorder have been attributed to the health
food supplement L-tryptophan, the Centers for Disease Control
reported Thursday.
   The CDC said it has received reports of 1,269 cases of
eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the disorder first linked in
November to L-tryptophan.
   A total of 210 cases, including four deaths, have been reported
in California. The CDC studied files on 118 of those cases and
found that 89 percent were female and 94 percent non-Hispanic
whites.
   The median time between use of L-tryptophan and the onset of
symptoms was 152 days.
   The CDC report did not include individual figures for other
states.
   The disorder, marked by an abnormally high number of white blood
cells called eosinophils, causes severe muscle pain, or myalgia,
and can cause death.
   About two-thirds of the California patients also suffered
coughing and rashes. Other symptoms include arm and leg swelling
and fever.
   Most patients recover. In California, 29 percent of the patients
had to be hospitalized.
   Scientists with the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration are
investigating the outbreak. The FDA issued a recall request for
L-tryptophan on Nov. 17 and expanded it four days later to block
importation of the product, a protein component widely taken as a
nutritional supplement.
   Last month, the FDA cautioned consumers against buying
L-tryptophan products from a California company which, the agency
said, did not comply with the recall request.
   More than 300 other manufacturers, packers and distributors did
comply with the recall request, FDA officials said.

   The United States should do more
to control the export of semi-automatic weapons into Colombia that
end up in the hands of drug traffickers, U.S. Ambassador Thomas E.
McNamara said Thursday.
   McNamara acknowledged that the availability of these U.S.-made
weapons aggravates the drug problem.
   President Bush has voiced opposition to new laws controlling the
manufacture or export of semi-automatic weapons, claiming laws
already on the books are adequate.
   At the same time, he has acted to ban the import into the United
States of the same type of weapons.
   McNamara, speaking with reporters covering Bush's visit to a
four-nation drug summit in nearby Cartagena, said: ``I think we can
do more to control the export of firearms and Colombia can do more
to monitor imports.''
   He said that the problem of U.S. guns reaching Colombian drug
traffickers was mainly a ``smuggling operation.'' U.S. law
generally limits sale of such U.S.-made weapons only to other
governments, although there is a process under which others can
acquire the weapons by obtaining ``end use'' certificates from the
U.S. goverrnment.
   McNamara said Thursday's conference among Bush and the
presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru went beyond just symbolism.
   ``You have all four presidents sitting down for a day, talking
about the drug fight _ that's more than symbolism,'' he said. ``For
the first time, we'll have a coordinated strategy in the four
countries involved.''
   McNamara said the Colombians were ``taking pride in being able
to host a quiet, calm meeting.''

   Sophia Loren and husband Carlo
Ponti have found a new residence in this village after having to
quit the tiny apartment listed for tax reasons as their official
home.
   Their landlord, Alois Blaettler, confirmed Thursday he gave the
couple notice to leave the furnished two rooms plus kitchen and
bath because his daughter wanted to move in.
   ``They hardly ever saw the place anyway,'' Blaettler said.
Village secretary Ernst Minder said the couple easily found a new,
equally modest home in the village, which has a population of 4,000.
   Fan letters to the new address are unlikely to be answered
because their visits there are expected to be equally rare.
   The Zurich tabloid Blick said Thursday the couple set up base in
the low-tax Swiss canton of Nidwalden more than 30 years ago and
moved to Hergiswil six years ago.
   Blick said that Ponti pays about $33,000 per year in taxes under
a lump-sum deal negotiated with canton tax authorities.

   Houston Oilers nose tackle Doug Smith,
wounded in the knee with a hunting rifle during an argument outside
a nightclub, is expected to recover and return to his football
career, a doctor said.
   Smith, 30, was listed in good condition at Craven Regional
Medical Center on Thursday, two days after he was wounded in his
hometown of Mesic, N.C.
   George Credle, 40, of Mesic, was charged with assault with a
deadly weapon with intent to kill. Credle fired two shots at Smith,
hitting him once, as the football player tried to run away, said
Sheriff Leland Brinson.
   Credle was arrested a few miles away.
   ``The knee remains functionally intact,'' said Dr. Carl Hiller,
an orthopedic surgeon. ``Barring complications, Smith plans to
return to his football career.''
   The 6-foot-6, 286-pound Smith was a second-round draft choice of
the Oilers in 1984, but he opted instead to sign with the
Birmingham Stallions of the short-lived United States Football
League. He joined the Oilers in 1985.

<HEAD>Ortega Rebuked for Threatening Opposition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The State Department rebuked Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega on Thursday for threatening to seize
opposition leaders' property, including an anti-Sandinista
newspaper, if his party wins national elections this month.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher called on Ortega to commit his
leftist Sandinista party ``to respect the political, civil and
human rights of opposition parties.''
   ``If we win,'' Ortega told a campaign rally Wednesday night, ``I
say we will hand them a complete bill, so they will be left without
a newspaper _ La Prensa _ and the homes of the candidate and the
vice presidential candidate will be converted into children's homes
on the day after the elections.''
   Boucher expressed concern about the statement and said that
under international agreements signed by Ortega, elections are
envisioned as a first step in a national reconciliation process.
   Ortega's threat was in response to a recent speech by opposition
vice presidential candidate Virgilio Godoy, who said if the
14-party opposition coalition wins the Feb. 25 election, ``we are
going to make the Sandinistas pay the bills one by one'' for
alleged violations of human, civil and political rights.
   The opposition newspaper La Prensa is owned by the family of
Ortega's main rival in the election, Violeta Chamorro.
   About 1.7 million voters will choose a president and vice
president, a National Assembly, municipal councils for 144 towns
and two regional councils for the Atlantic Coast.
   Meanwhile, President Bush said in an interview with USA Today
that he would not try to oust Ortega, as he did Manuel Antonio
Noriega in Panama, even if he concludes Ortega has stolen the

   ``No,'' he said in response to a question. ``There's a lot of
non-elected leaders around the world that can sleep comfortable.''
   Pressed on that point, Bush called the line of questioning ``too
hypothetical, but the answer is no.''
   ``If you're talking about an effort to protect American life or
something, the signal should be loud and clear: I'll do what's
necessary to protect American lives. But if you're saying I don't
like the results of an election and will be use military force, the
answer is no.''

   About 5,000 teachers skipped school
Thursday, staging a rally on the Capitol steps, laying siege to the
House of Delegates and picketing the governor's mansion in their
battle for higher pay.
   State troopers were called in to patrol the aisles of the House
after teachers pounded on the doors of the chamber and chanted,
``Let us in.''
   At a rally on the Capitol steps, the teachers criticized Gov.
Gaston Caperton for not including teacher pay raises in his $1.5
billion budget proposal for 1990-91.
   Caperton said he was not surprised by their frustration, ``but
you can't pay people when you don't have the money.''
   The governor invited union leaders to meet with him Thursday,
but they refused, a spokesman said. Instead, the governor met
informally with about a dozen teachers allowed into the mansion
while hundreds of others stood outside.
   The union said West Virginia ranks 49th in the nation in teacher
pay. The average teacher's salary in the state is $21,904.
   Teachers are also upset with what they say is inadequate funding
of the teachers retirement system, which has a deficit estimated at
up to $3 billion, and with proposals to charge premiums for health
coverage.

<HEAD>Mouse Model For Human Leukemia May Help Fight Killer Disease,
Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers, using an intricate manipulation
of genes and transplantation of bone marrow, have produced a mouse
that suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving
scientists a new way to test therapies against the killer disease.
   In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science,
researchers at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research said
they have discovered a way to give chronic myelogenous leukemia,
CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of leukemia that usually
attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   ``With this new animal model, experimental therapies that might
otherwise be tried in human patients can now be tested in these
mice,'' said George Daley, lead researcher in the study at
Whitehead. ``You obviously can do more with the mice than you could
with human patients.''
   Daley said the study also proves that CML is initiated by the
fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes, a finding that had
been suggested by earlier studies in other laboratories. Those
parts have been identified as the so-called ABL gene from
chromosome 9 and a gene called BCR from chromosome 22.
   Cells containing this hybrid gene produce a protein, called
P210, that changes healthy cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said his study showed that transferring the BCR@ABL gene
into mouse bone marrow and then putting these infected cells into
healthy mice could produce CML in those mice.
   ``It answers a question of basic science, that is, what causes
the disease,'' said Daley. ``We now know that the BCR@ABL gene is
sufficient to induce the leukemia.''
   He said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.
   Dr. George Canellos, chief of medical oncology at the
Dana-Farber Institute in Boston, described the Whitehead finding as
``an important advance in understanding the disease.''
   He said the new animal model of the disease possibly may help
scientists find ways to block the action of the P210 protein
produced by the BCR@ABL gene, thus preventing the disease.
   Daley said that the mouse can be used to test ``biological
inhibitors'' that would prevent the P210 protein from transforming
normal cells into cancers. Such inhibitors formally could only be
tested on human patients, a process that could take years. With a
mouse model of the disease, experiments can be speeded up and can
be more extensive.
   To create the mouse model, Daley said he and his collegues
inserted the human BCR@ABL gene into a virus. Normal mouse bone
marrow cells were then exposed to the virus, which transferred the
gene into the marrow cells.
   Thirty healthy mice were then irradiated to kill their bone
marrow cells. The bone marrow carrying the BCR@ABL gene was then
transplanted into the 30 mice.
   Within five months, 13 of the 30 mice developed a blood disease
that mimicked human chronic myelogenous leukemia.
   CML in humans can be controlled by chemotherpy for 3 to 5 years.
This remission period usually ends with the sudden increase in
abnormal cells, a disease phase called ``blast crisis'' that
usually results in death. The only successful therapy now is to
kill the diseased bone marrow in the patient and replace it with
healthy bone marrow from a compatible donor, but even this
treatment often fails.
   Daley said that continued studies of the CML mice shows that
many of the laboratory animals develop the ``blast crisis'' phase
of the disease. This, he said, is further verification that the
course of the disease in the mice is similar to CML in humans.
   Co-authors of the study with Daley were Richard A. Van Etten and
David Baltimore, both of the Whitehead Institute. Science, which
published the study, is the journal of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Phoenix Mayor Resigns to Run for Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Terry Goddard resigned today to seek the
Democratic Party's gubernatorial nomination, creating a
front-runner in the race to fill the post being vacated by Gov.
Rose Mofford.
   Goddard said he was responding to the urgings of ``thousands of
Arizonans'' and agreed because ``Arizona needs effective
leadership.''
   Goddard, son of state Democratic Party chief Sam Goddard, a
former governor, was elected to his first term as mayor by a narrow
margin in 1983. He won re-election three times with only token
opposition, most recently against state Republican Party chairman
Burton Kruglick last October.
   During the campaign, Goddard accused Kruglick of endorsing a
whispering campaign labeling him as homosexual.
   ``For the record ... I'm not gay, I've never been gay and I'm
not bisexual,'' the 43-year-old bachelor told a campaign rally.
``But I've been accused of both.''
   Goddard, a lawyer and Harvard University graduate, first came to
political prominence when he led drives to repeal an unpopular
statewide gasoline tax and to scrap Phoenix's at-large system of
electing City Council members in favor of a district system.
   He was the first Democrat in 20 years to be elected Phoenix
mayor.
   Carolyn Warner, a former state school superintendent who is
considered Goddard's strongest potential Democratic opponent, was
in Hawaii and not available for comment, according to her
spokesman, David Bolger.
   The only other Democrat to have announced formally for governor
is Ray C. Brown, a Sedona lawyer.
   Mofford, a Democrat and longtime secretary of state who was
thrust into the governor's office after the removal of Republican
Gov. Evan Mecham, dropped out of the race last month. Chief Justice
Frank Gordon Jr. of the Arizona Supreme Court and Maricopa County
Supervisor Carole Carpenter also opted out.
   State law required Goddard to resign as mayor to run for
governor. City council members must choose his successor from among
themselves.

   Opposition leaders accused Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on Thursday of using the East German crisis to enhance
his political standing and secure a place in history as the man who
unified Germany.
   During a raucous, insult-filled Parliament session, Kohl in turn
accused the opposition of being allied with the old Communists who
ruled East Germany with an iron fist.
   The chancellor also came under fire in East Germany, where the
Communist-led government accused Kohl of exaggerating the country's
economic and political problems to speed reunification.
   The verbal brawl in Parliament gave West German voters a preview
of what is likely to be a bitter campaign for West German elections
in December, and the pivotal role reunification will play.
   The West German campaign is even influencing the campaign for
East Germany's first free elections March 18. In anticipation of
eventual reunification, West German parties have been aligning
themselves with, and in fact influence, the fledgling political
parties in East Germany.
   Kohl outlined to Parliament his weekend talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on reunification. He said both
agreed the March 18 elections _ when the Communist government
likely will be ousted _ were a key to reunification.
   ``I was able to underscore my firm belief (to Gorbachev) that
the result of the elections will not only be a democratic and
negotiations-capable government, but also a government program with
the clear goal: `Unity as soon as possible,''' said Kohl.
   Kohl said his talks ``set the course'' for unification.
   ``Never before since the division of our land ... have we been
so close to our goal ...'' Kohl told Parliament.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, head of the main opposition Social Democrats,
accused Kohl of providing too little financial help for East
Germany and of using unification for his own political benefit.
   ``You have talked, awakened hopes, set conditions ... and
meditated over your place in the history books. But there hasn't
been much help,'' said Vogel.
   Vogel also said Kohl was wrong to speak about a ``historic
breakthrough'' from his talks with Gorbachev and said that
Gorbachev already had said the Soviets supported Germans' right to
self-determination before the talks.
   ``If we are to speak about a historic breakthrough, then it was
this decision of Mikhail Gorbachev,'' said Vogel.
   Kohl's address was interrupted several times as he lambasted the
Social Democrats for having close contacts with East Germany's
now-disgraced Communists during years past.
   ``You were allied with these people,'' said Kohl, also charging
that the Social Democrats did not favor German unification until it
became politically expedient.
   Vogel reminded Kohl that his own Christian Democrats are now
supporting the East German Christian Democrats, who for years were
allied with the Communists.
   ``Mr. Chancellor, whoever supports the East (Christian
Democrats) _ which for 40 years went along with everything (the
Communists said) _ has no right to point the finger at the Social
Democrats,'' said Vogel.
   In East Berlin, East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer
also accused Bonn of overdramatizing the political and economic
situation in East Germany in an attempt to speed unification.
   The Kohl government has said that more than 2,000 East Germans
daily are fleeing West as the East German economy nears collapse.
   A key issue to reunification is whether a new German state would
be neutral. East Germany is a key member of the Soviet Warsaw Pact
and West Germany is a strategic component of NATO.
   Kohl and the United States want what at least is now West
Germany to remain in NATO, while the Soviets want a neutral Germany.
   Earlier this week, the Germanys and the four World War II allies
_ the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain and France _ agreed
to talks on reunification that will deal with the alliance issue.
   In East Berlin, government spokesman Wolfgang Myers attacked
Kohl for failing to assure Poles that a united Germany will not try
to reclaim large chunks of formerly German land was assigned to
Poland after Nazi Germany was defeated during World War II.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher rejected
Poland's request to be included in the talks, but he said the
discussions will address Polish concerns.
   Kohl, eager to garner the right-wing vote, has failed to give an
unequivocal rejection of any possible territorial claims.
   In the latest nationwide polls, Kohl was leading the Social
Democrats by about six points. A poll last August _ before the
historic developments in East Germany _ showed the left-leaning
Social Democrats and Kohl's conservative Christian Democrats nearly
even.
   But the Social Democrats overwhelmed Kohl's Christian Democrats
in recent Saarland state elections, and the chancellor's party is
still trying to recover from the defeat.

<HEAD>Quayle Says He's Changed His Views About the Soviet Union</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle, often the voice of
skepticism within the White House toward the Soviet Union, said
Thursday he has changed his opinion about the communist state.
   ``I would say anybody that has not changed their mind over the
last six or seven months is not thinking correctly,'' he said of
the fast-changing reforms that Mikhail S. Gorbachev has ushered in
in Moscow.
   ``Of course you change your opinion,'' Quayle said after a
reporter asked if he remained suspicious of Gorbachev's intentions.
   ``A lot of things have happened, and I have a different
assessment of where the Soviet Union is heading and where it may or
may not go than I did six months ago or a year ago.''
   Quayle spoke outside the Greater Southeast Community Hospital,
where he visited a ward filled with ``boarder babies'' _ infants
abandoned at birth by drug-abusing mothers.
   Quayle made the hospital visit on the same morning President
Bush was off at the drug summit in Colombia to dramatize what the
vice president called ``the end of the (drug) pipeline.''
   ``This is the end of the pipeline right here. As it comes out of
the fields in Peru or Colombia or Bolivia of elsewhere and comes
through the system, the end result is a baby that is born dependant
upon drugs,'' said Quayle.
   ``What I have just seen is the human tragedy of drugs. ...
Anybody that advocates the legalization of drugs, saying it is a
victimless crime, I suggest that they go up and tour this hospital
and see those boarder babies with me,'' he said.
   At the hospital, Quayle picked up 5-month-old Kevin and held a
19-month-old boarder baby, Dougie, who was rescued from an unsafe
home five months ago. The hospital has 11 boarder babies whose care
can cost up to $100,000 a year apiece. Most were born inheriting
their mother's addiction to cocaine or other hard drugs.
   Hospital officials voiced concern that they were having
difficulties making ends meet, especially due to cuts in the
Medicaid and Medicare programs.
   Quayle said, ``I reassured them of our commitment. Wouldn't we
like to do more? Of course we would, but we're dealing with a
strained budget environment.''
   Quayle, who has generally struck a skeptical and hardline view
toward the Soviet Union, said in a Dec. 4 newspaper interview after
Bush's summit with Gorbachev at Malta that, ``I don't think they've
changed much in foreign policy'' and ``you're still dealing with a
totalitarian government.''
   He later said that ``authoritarian'' was a more fitting
adjective than ``totalitarian'' to describe the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev this week agreed to Bush's proposal for dramatic
reductions in U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe, limiting both sides
to 195,000 troops in central Europe and allowing the United States
to keep 30,000 elsewhere in Europe.
   Quayle also visited Jacqueline Mitchell's home in a largely
poor, black neighborhood north of the U.S. Capitol where she and
other neighbors have banded together to keep drug dealers and
customers from the suburbs out of their street.
   After chatting in the Mitchell living room with members of the
neighborhood watch group, Quayle shook hands with residents out on
the street and advised three young men: ``Don't let (the
drug-dealers) in. Just keep them out.''

   The Agriculture Department said Thursday that
fertilizer prices are going up as spring planting approaches, but
probably won't be as high as a year ago.
   According to a preliminary report by the department's Economic
Research Service, fertilizer prices may be up 4 percent from last
fall. But despite the increase, spring prices may be down about 4
percent from year-earlier levels.
   ``Planted areas of corn and wheat, the major fertilizer-using
crops, will probably increase by 1 percent to 5 percent,'' the
report said. ``Decreases in planted acreage are anticipated for
soybeans.''
   Analysts said supplies of nitrogen, phosphate and potash should
be enough to meet 1990 requirements, although greater nitrogen
imports will more than make up for lower domestic production.
   ``Nitrogen prices will likely show the greatest increase since
last fall as domestic supplies tighten,'' the report said.
``Phosphate supplies should be sufficient to meet demand at
moderately higher prices than last fall, even with a slight
reduction in domestic production.''
   Potash inventories are expected to be available at ``stable to
slightly lower'' prices than last fall if price cuts initiated by
Canadian producers continue, the report said.

   Thousands of angry whites marched
through the city Thursday to demand the resignation of President
F.W. de Klerk's government for releasing Nelson Mandela and
legalizing black opposition groups.
   The opposition Conservative Party staged the rally to kick off a
drive to oust de Klerk and preserve the apartheid system of racial
segregation. Party chief Andries Treurnicht demanded immediate
elections and predicted de Klerk would lose.
   ``Hang F.W. de Klerk'' and ``Keep South Africa White,'' said
placards carried by marchers as they passed through the city
center. Police said some 15,000 people took part in the peaceful,
but boisterous march.
   De Klerk angered the Conservative Party by freeing Mandela on
Sunday after he had spent 27 years in prison and by legalizing his
African National Congress movement and other black opposition
groups. De Klerk has said he wants to negotiate a power-sharing
agreement with South Africa's black majority, which currently has
no voice in national affairs.
   The Conservatives have threatened to stage strikes to force an
election if de Klerk refuses to step down.
   ``F.W. de Klerk is a traitor to white South Africans!'' a leader
yelled at the start of the march. Many signs denounced racial
integration and called for creation of a separate white state.
   ``South Africa, South Africa,'' the crowd sang as they marched.
   Hundreds of uniformed stormtroopers of the neo-Nazi Afrikaneer
Resistance Party joined the march with swastika flags and signs
saying, ``Hang Mandela.'' Some of them hanged a small black doll
representing Mandela, and others marched with a severed black doll
head mounted on a stake.
   But most marchers were middle-class and working-class white men,
women and children.
   ``We want to stay a nation of whites. We're going to fight to
stay a nation on our own,'' said Ter Schumann, one of the marchers.
``We are going to stay a white nation.''
   A young white man, who would not give his name, said, ``South
Africa is for the whites. We will not tolerate F.W. de Klerk's
treason.''
   Thousands jammed City Hall afterward to hear Treurnicht denounce
de Klerk and the governing National Party as traitors to
Afrikaners, people of mainly Dutch descent who dominate white
politics in South Africa. Thousands of others stood outside,
listening to the speech relayed over loudspeakers.
   Treurnicht said the abolition of apartheid would not bring peace
to South Africa. He said de Klerk's reforms would put South Africa
under the rule of the ANC and the South African Communist Party.
   ``Our people have kept a low profile up to now, but we have
fought for our own fatherland and that fatherland you will not take
away from us,'' Treurnicht said.
   Ferdie Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the Conservative Party,
said de Klerk deceived whites by legalizing black opposition
groups. He said the great majority of whites do not support such
reforms.
   ``President de Klerk ... should resign,'' he said as the crowd
roared its approval.
   Local observers said the turnout was an impressive show of
strength for the Conservative Party, which won 31 percent of the
white vote in elections in September. Dozens of buses from
surrounding towns brought people into Pretoria for the march.

   U.S. food aid to the Afghan rebels has been
suspended for the second time in three months because some of the
assistance has been stolen, the State Department said Thursday.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said he expects that new
arrangements for monitoring the assistance will be in place soon
and that the suspension will be brief.
   Food shipments representing about 30 percent of total U.S.
humanitarian aid to the rebels were suspended in late November
because of difficulty in meeting government monitoring reqirements,
he said.
   He said the shipments were resumed in January but have been
suspended again.
   The Washington Post reported in Thursday's editions that the
suspension was ordered after members of Pakistan's military
intelligence agency, which supervises the distribution of the aid,
diverted 2,400 tons of the U.S.-supplied wheat.
   The U.S. humanitarian aid program is listed at $70 million for
the fiscal year 1990.

   The government said Thursday it would
have the flight data recorder of a crashed Indian Airlines jetliner
analyzed in a country other than France, where the Airbus A320 was
manufactured.
   At least 91 of the 146 on the 3-month-old jetliner were killed
when it crashed Wednesday, in clear weather, short of the airport
at Bangalore. Officials said there were no signs of an emergency on
board.
   The Times of India quoted unidentified aviation sources as
saying the sophisticated plane, which had logged 366 flying hours,
may have crashed because the pilot ``tried to change the mode of
control from computer to manual or vice-versa.''
   It said the ``response time of the inflight computer for doing
this is five to six seconds,'' and indicated that amount of time
could be crucial in landing.
   Another paper, the Hindustan Times of New Delhi, said the
instruments may have indicated the wrong altitude for the jet. Both
the pilot and the co-pilot died in the crash.
   Science Report said the A320 has a pre-programmed ``envelope
protection software that tells the computer _ and not the pilot _
to make judgments.''
   If the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision,
the report said, the system would ``not let the airplane respond
beyond a certain rate.''
   Aviation Minister Arif Mohammed Khan told a news conference in
Bangalore, southern India: ``Since the Airbus belongs to France, we
would like to send'' the data recorder ``to some other country for
decoding.''
   The plane was made by Airbus Industrie, a European consortium
based in Toulouse, France.
   Khan said preliminary reports on the cause of the crash would be
available within 36 hours, United News of India reported. He has
ordered separate inquiries by a high court judge and aviation
authorities.
   ``This kind of crash can happen either because of equipment
error, or human error or navigational error,'' Khan said. ``The
cockpit voice recorder is being sent to Delhi and its contents will
be known within 36 hours.''
   A U.S. Embassy official in New Delhi said one American on the
plane was killed, one was missing and five were known to have
survived. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
identities would not be released until their families had been
notified.
   John Mancosky, 28, of Chicago, said the plane began to shake
about five minutes before the crash and he thought at first the
pilot had made a hard landing.
   ``Then we heard a loud booming noise and soon we were enveloped
in a ball of flame,'' said Mancosky, who suffered a broken leg.
Like most of the survivors, he escaped through the rear door.
   This was the second accident involving an A320 and the first in
commercial service. Three people were killed and 50 injured when an
A320 crashed at an airshow in eastern France in June 1988.
   The twin-engined, narrow-bodied jet is the first civilian
airliner with a fully computerized flight control system.

   Private property was a hated concept for
generations of Communists, but Soviet lawmakers were asked by
government leaders on Thursday to legalize it, not condemn it.
   ``If we want to have a market economy and take part in the
international marketplace, then we need such a law,'' Justice
Minister Veniamin F. Yakovlev said in defense of a bill designed to
establish private property rights.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's nearly five-year tenure as Soviet leader
has led to numerous upheavals in politics and society, but few
official proposals have the ideological sweep of the proposed
Property Law submitted to the Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Citizens who were taught for generations that, in the words of
19th-century French philosopher Pierre Joseph Proudhon, ``property
is theft,'' are now being asked to accept private ownership along
with two other forms of property already in existence _ collective
and state ownership.
   Because of ideological squeamishness, the 35-article bill
debated on the second day of the Supreme Soviet's 1990 winter
session never uses the words ``private property'' outright.
Instead, it speaks of ``the property of citizens.''
   ``The words `private property' cause an allergy in us all,'' one
lawmaker acknowledged from the tribune.
   Fellow deputy Leonid I. Sukhov, a taxi driver from the Ukrainian
city of Kharkov, said the measure would provoke such a turnabout in
law and lifestyle that it should be put to a nationwide referendum.
   ``We have to ask the people,'' Sukhov said. ``The people know
better.''
   The driver said he would vote against the measure because it
would worsen the lives of average Soviets, already hard-pressed to
cope with chronic shortages of food and consumer goods, inadequate
salaries and inflation.
   In 1848, Marx and Engels, the ideological fathers of communism,
said they could sum up their theory in a single phrase: ``the
abolition of private property.'' For decades Soviet orthodoxy has
forbidden the private ownership of farms, factories or equipment on
a large scale, seeing in such ownership the roots of economic
exploitation.
   But the proposed Property Law legalizes individual ownership of
``means of production,'' without defining that term, and says
foreign firms, once scorned as agents of imperialism or
neo-colonialism, can own factories and buildings on Soviet soil.
   The bill would allow foreigners to enjoy the same rights as
Soviet citizens in owning property. Citizens could own stocks and
bonds.
   It follows last week's historic measures by the Communist Party
leadership to allow other parties to compete for power. The party
also laid the groundwork for the property bill by approving the
concept in its revised platform.
   The law is designed to spur the stagnating Soviet economy
through the greater productivity that private enterprise is now
recognized to offer over state-owned factories and businesses, and
by encouraging Western capital.
   A companion bill on the legislature's winter agenda, the Law on
Land, provides for the private ownership of land.
   After its first reading before the 542-member Supreme Soviet
last fall, the Property Law underwent substantial revision with at
least 10,000 changes suggested, the official Tass news agency said.
   Despite the revisions, the bill drew fire from 30 lawmakers who
demanded a five-minute chance to air their views.
   Vavil Nosov, a machine-operator from the Komi region of northern
Russia, said he feared that if the buying and selling of land is
allowed, the beneficiaries will be black marketeers with illegal
fortunes.
   A lawmaker from Soviet Central Asia worried aloud that if water
resources like rivers and lakes become the property of local
administrative bodies, water might be diverted from his parched
homeland.
   Conflict also arose over who now owns natural resources _ the
national government or the individual Soviet republics. The issue
was skirted in the draft in favor of phrasing that says the land
and its resources ``belong to people living on a given territory.''
   That issue is critical because the legislature in Lithuania has
already adopted laws allowing the sale of land to individuals.
   Debate was to continue Friday, with the Law on Land also on the
agenda.

   Imports accounted for an all-time high of 54
percent of the nation's petroleum consumption last month, the
American Petroleum Institute said Thursday.
   Although the record-high level was spurred in part by a bitter
cold snap across much of the nation in December that increased
demand for heating fuel, officials said they feared it could signal
a trend toward monthly imports of at least 50 percent.
   Imports last accounted for more than half of the country's
petroleum consumption in July, which marked the first time they had
crossed the 50 percent level in 12 years.
   The surge in petroleum imports last month comes during a
continued slowdown in domestic drilling activity, prompting a call
for congressional consideration of a plan to ensure that the United
States does not become dependent on foreign sources for more than
half its oil consumption.
   Monthly oil imports have exceeded 50 percent only four times _
last July, when they reached 50.4 percent, in March and July 1977,
when they hit 51.8 percent of consumption, and in May 1977, when
the level reached 50.5 percent.

case seeking Noriega testimony.</NOTE>

   A pilot admitted Thursday to flying $800,000 in
cocaine profits from Florida to Panama in 1983, becoming the first
of Manuel Noriega's co-defendants to plead guilty in the drug
trafficking case.
   Noriega's lawyers said their client had nothing to fear from
information the Panamanian pilot, Eduardo Pardo, might give
prosecutors.
   ``If he tells the truth, he can't hurt us,'' said Noriega
attorney Frank Rubino.
   Pardo, 44, was arrested by Drug Enforcement Administration
agents in Panama City after the U.S. invasion. His attorney,
William Meadows, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Sullivan said
there was no plea bargain in the case.
   Noriega and Pardo were among 16 people indicted in Miami in
February 1988 on charges of taking part in a conspiracy that made
Panama a way station and processing center for Colombia's Medellin
drug cartel.
   Shaken and occasionally close to tears, Pardo, who faces up to
five years in prison and a $10,000 fine at sentencing April 25 on a
single count of illegal travel, admitted to prosecutors' account of
the 1983 drug-money flight.
   Pardo and co-defendant Daniel Miranda flew a Lear jet fitted
``with secret compartments so that money could be hidden,''
Sullivan told the court. ``They were worried that the secret
compartment made the plane unsafe to fly, but they were assured it
was OK.''
   Pardo received $40,000 for the flight and knew it was drug
money, the prosecutor said.
   Meadows said he had no idea whether Pardo would testify against
Noriega or any of the other defendants.
   The defendant most immediately threatened by Pardo, should he
testify for the prosecution, appeared to be Miranda, who allegedly
accompanied him on the flight.
   But Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane, said his client did not
know the money came from drugs. ``I guess Pardo's guilty. That
doesn't mean that Miranda is,'' O'Kane said.
   Richard Sharpstein, attorney for Brian Alden Davidow, the only
defendant free on bail, said outside court that even without an
agreement to testify for the government, Pardo's plea made him a
likely witness.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from the
cartel. The Panamanian leader, who surrendered to U.S. troops after
the December invasion of his country, has disputed the right of a
U.S. civilian court to judge him.
   He and the other defendants, except for Davidow, are being held
in the Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami.
   In New Orleans, attorneys for crewmen of a Panamanian freighter
that carried 12,000 pounds of cocaine want Noriega to testify at
the crewmen's trial. The Coast Guard seized the freighter in the
Gulf of Mexico in October.
   The defense has argued that U.S. authorities didn't have the
permission of Panamanian authorities to board the ship; prosecutors
say Panama's President Eric Delvalle gave blanket authorization
before his term expired Sept. 1.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz Jr. has denied the request
for Noriega's appearance, but asked lawyers Wednesday for detailed
memos.

   Thirty-five million Americans report suffering
from arthritis and 6 million admit they haven't seen a doctor about
it, according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by the
Centers for Disease Control.
   ``People are seeing (pain-killer) ads on TV and treating their
arthritis themselves _ and very possibly doing damage to
themselves,'' said Steve Erickson, spokesman for the Arthritis
Foundation. The problem will probably get worse if pain relievers
are the only treatment, he said.
   Erickson said too few people are aware of the warning signs of
arthritis, such as joint swelling, early morning stiffness,
recurring joint pain or inability to move a joint that lasts for
more than two weeks.

   At least 14 deaths and 1,269 cases of a rare,
painful blood disorder known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome have
been attributed to the health food supplement L-tryptophan, the
Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   The disorder, marked by an abnormally high number of white blood
cells, causes severe muscle pain and can cause death. The median
time between use of L-tryptophan and the onset of symptoms was 152
days.
   The FDA issued a recall request for L-tryptophan on Nov. 17 and
expanded it four days later to block importation of the product, a
protein component widely taken as a nutritional supplement.
   Last month, the FDA cautioned consumers against buying
L-tryptophan products from a California company that did not comply
with the recall request.

   Researchers using an intricate manipulation of
genes and transplantation of bone marrow have produced a mouse that
suffers from a vicious form of human leukemia, giving scientists a
new way to test therapies against the killer disease.
   In a report to be published Friday in the magazine Science,
researchers said they have discovered a way to give chronic
myelogenous leukemia, CML, to laboratory mice. CML is a form of
leukemia that usually attacks adults and is only rarely cured.
   Lead researcher George Daley said the study also proves that CML
is initiated by the fusion of parts from two broken chromosomes, a
finding that had been suggested by earlier studies. Cells
containing the hybrid gene produce a protein that changes healthy
cells into cancer cells.
   Daley said it is still not known precisely what causes the two
chromosomes to break and create the hybrid gene, but a high
exposure to radiation is thought to be a factor.

   A study of airline-cabin environment found
that, even with the smoking ban that takes effect in 10 days,
passengers and crew still face a health risk from increased
radiation from the sun and stars.
   The study released Thursday by the Transportation Department
recommends that airlines schedule cabin crews in ways that will
reduce their risk to cosmic radiation, especially those crews who
regularly fly near the North Pole and South Pole or at higher
altitudes.
   The study found the risk of cancer death from cosmic radiation
comparable to the risk of death from exposure to smoke-filled
cabins, although estimates of cancer caused by cosmic rays had a
wider range because of uncertainty over the effects of low doses of
radiation.
   It also recommended a total smoking ban but was superceded by
congressional action banning smoking on all flights of six hours or
less beginning Feb. 25.

   The Communist Party newspaper Thursday accused
Chinese media of failing the party during the spring pro-democracy
movement and said in the future they must never veer from the party
line.
   The press was guilty of ``allowing the rotten ideology and way
of life of the bourgeois class to corrupt the soul of the people''
during the spring uprising, the People's Daily said.
   Hostile forces both at home and abroad continue to spread rumors
``to confuse the people,'' it alleged.
   ``Even during the most arduous period of our struggle against
the enemy, our media should advocate the leadership of the party,
the party line and general and specific policies and should
encourage people to continue the revolution despite all
obstacles,'' said the newspaper.
   Freedom of the press was one of the main demands of the
student-led democracy movement, and for a brief time in May the
official press, including the People's Daily, broke with party
ranks and published remarkably objective reports about the
political turmoil.
   Many reporters from China's main newspapers and radio and
television stations marched in demonstrations and expressed support
for greater press freedom.
   The People's Daily said that at a critical time, referring to
the period before and during the democracy movement, ``some papers
even revealed the dark side of the party and talked about our party
and socialist system as if they did not have any redeeming
features.''
   The media beautified capitalism, it said, and as a result some
people wondered ``how long the Communist Party's red flag would
survive.''
   The article said it is ``strictly forbidden to deviate from the
principles of the party,'' and that critical articles should be
secondary to positive reporting. ``Total control must be
maintained,'' it said.
   The government quickly regained control over the media after
martial law was declared in Beijing on May 20 and troops launched
their bloody attack on June 3-4 to crush the democracy movement.
   The chief editor of the People's Daily was replaced by the head
of the army propaganda department. Other editors were sacked,
Shanghai's outspoken World Economic Herald and other journals were
closed, and numerous reporters were arrested or fired.
   Since then, articles on party corruption, economic disasters and
crime have been allowed only if they illustrate how the party is
striving to eradicate such problems.

   Mayor Marion Barry, undergoing treatment in
Florida following his January arrest on a cocaine possession
charge, was indicted today by a federal grand jury on eight counts
of perjury and possession of a controlled substance.
   The 14-month probe began after Barry was discovered visiting the
hotel room of an associate, Charles Lewis, who later pleaded guilty
to conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine. Barry was said to
have told the grand jury that he had never used cocaine. Lewis had
testified to the contrary.
   The indictment comes four weeks after Barry was arrested on a
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge and on the same day that
President Bush and leaders of three Latin American nations met at a
drug summit in Colombia.
   Barry is undergoing treatment for substance abuse at a Florida
clinic and has turned over the day-to-day operations of the
district government to the city administrator.
   The lengthy investigation, conducted by the FBI and the internal
affairs department of the city police force, moved toward
indictment after one-time Barry girlfriend Rasheeda Moore agreed to
cooperate with authorities. Barry was videotaped in a hotel room
with Moore using crack cocaine, authorities said.
   Barry has steadfastly denied using drugs. ``I have never used
any illegal drugs, nor have I knowingly purchased or been given any
illegal drugs, nor have I knowingly been around anyone using
illegal drugs,'' Barry said last August after Lewis told
prosecutors that he had smoked cracked cocaine with the mayor.
   At an emotional appearance following his arrest Jan. 18, he
admitted having a problem with alcohol but said nothing about drugs.
   Since his arrest, Barry's political support in the city has
dwindled and several supporters have urged him not to seek another
term. There are four announced Democratic candidates for Barry's
job. Jesse Jackson, who moved to the city last year fueling
speculation that he would run for mayor, has said he would not
challenge Barry.
   The U.S. Attorney's Office said in a statement that the
indictment resulted from ``an ongoing investigation of public
corruption and illegal narcotics activity.''
   Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, was not immediately
available for comment.
   The indictment charged that during a Jan. 19, 1989, grand jury
appearance Barry lied under oath by stating he was not aware that
Lewis was involved with drugs and by stating that the two men had
not exchanged cocaine.
   Lewis, who also is cooperating with the investigation, was
recently sentenced to 15 months in prison on drug charges.
   Four charges against Barry involve alleged possession of cocaine
between Dec. 16-22, 1988, the period when Barry was with Lewis at
the downtown Ramada Inn.
   The fifth drug-possession charge stems from Barry's arrest at
the Vista International Hotel where he was videotaped with Moore.
   Each of the three felony false declaration charges carries a
five-year prison term and a maximum fine of $250,000. Each of the
misdemeanor possession charges carries a maximum sentence of one
year in jail and a fine of $100,000.
   The indictment gave the following description of Barry's
appearance before the grand jury:
   ``Have you ever seen Mr. Lewis with anything that indicated he
was involved in drugs of any sort?'' Barry was asked.
   ``No, I have not,'' the mayor answered. The indictment charged
that this statement was false.
   ``Have you ever talked to Mr. Lewis about drugs?'' the mayor was
asked. ``No, not to my recollection,'' Barry responded, in another
statement prosecutors alleged was false.
   In another count, Barry is charged with lying when he said,
``I've never given Mr. Lewis any cocaine or any other drug.''
   The prosecutor then asked, ``I believe it's safe to assume you
did not ever give Mr. Lewis any cocaine?''
   ``Cocaine. Absolutely,'' the mayor replied, according to the
indictment.
   Another count charged that Barry lied when asked ``Did Mr. Lewis
ever give you cocaine?''
   ``No.'' the mayor replied.
   ``Have you ever received cocaine from anyone at the Ramada?''
   ``No,'' Barry replied.
   The three-term mayor has been at a Florida substance abuse
clinic since Jan. 22, four days after his arrest on a misdemeanor
cocaine possession charge. He is scheduled to remain in the clinic
past the normal 28-day treatment cycle, according to top city
government sources.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens has said the investigation of
Barry began in December 1988 after city police aborted an attempt
to make an undercover drug purchase from Lewis at a downtown hotel
after learning that Barry was in the room.
   Lewis testified under oath that he supplied Barry with crack
cocaine.
   A district employee, Robert McWilliams, who was in Lewis' room
with Barry in December 1988, also has appeared before the same
panel.
   Barry, 53, told close advisers on the weekend of his arrest that
he was abandoning his bid for a fourth, four-year term in November.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be required to resign, and
City Council Chairman David Clarke would become acting mayor. A
special election would be held within 120 days of any resignation,
unless that date falls within 60 days of the Nov. 6 general
election.

   Two Navy jets collided over the
Atlantic on Thursday, killing one pilot and injuring the other,
authorities said.
   The planes were taking part in an exercise around noon when the
accident occurred 70 miles southeast of Jacksonville, the Navy said.
   The pilot killed was flying a single-engine A-4F attack jet from
Oceana Naval Air Station in Virginia, said Bert Byers, a spokesman
for Cecil Field Naval Air Station. The pilot's identity was not
immediately released.
   The other pilot, Cmdr. David R. Miller, 39, of Orange Park, was
rescued and was reported to be alert and talking at a hospital.
Miller was flying a twin-engine, single-seat FA-18 Hornet, a strike
fighter.
   The cause of the accident is under investigation.

   None of the four living former presidents
shows any interest in having the job again, according to an article
in the forthcoming issue of the Sunday newspaper supplement USA
Weekend.
   ``The time has come for younger people to serve the country,''
Gerald R. Ford, 77, told the magazine in an interview for its Feb.
16-18 issue.
   Ronald Reagan, 79, asked if he would like to president again,
said, ``I do not think so ... Nancy and I are happy in our new life
now and I like being back out there on `the mashed potato circuit'
talking with the people and, I hope, inspiring them to urge their
representatives to do some of the things we weren't able to
accomplish.''
   Jimmy Carter, 65, said he and his wife, Rosalynn, don`t ``miss
the pomp, ceremony and perks but we often remember how nice it was
to visit Camp David.'' He said he would not want to return to
office, but would ``be happy if one of my grandchildren becomes
president.''
   Richard Nixon, 77, asked if he would want to be president again,
replied only, ``Not if I have to answer such silly questions as
this one!''
   Reagan, Carter and Nixon responded to questions in writing. Ford
was interviewed over the telephone.
   All four said they do not believe former presidents should have
any formal role in government, such as a senator-at-large seat that
has sometimes been suggested.
   The magazine is publishing the interview in observance of
President's Day, which is Monday.
   Reagan and Ford both supported President Bush's decision to
invade Panama. Carter said he ``deplored the invasion'' but hoped
it will lead to ``freedom, democracy and economic prosperity.''
   Nixon said, ``I understand why President Bush acted as he did,''
but added that in general the United States should not directly
depose foreign leaders. ``When the United States decides by itself
who is going to run a country, it runs the risk of ending up
running the country itself,'' he said.
   Reagan said he goes to his ranch near Santa Barbara, Calif.,
once a month and still enjoys watching movies. Recent ones that he
has liked include ``Field of Dreams'' and ``Rain Man.'' He said he
has been reading ``Bicycle Days'' by John Burnham Schwartz and has
also recently read several Western novels by Louis L'Amour, an old
favorite, as well as essays on current events.
   Carter, commenting on the suggestion of some writers that he is
distinguishing himself more as an active ex-president than he did
in office, said it ``does not bother me, and I am grateful for the
more favorable attitude of the news media in recent years.''
   Nixon said he gave up golf because it was too time-consuming,
but walks three or four miles daily ``to keep fit and stimulate
thinking.'' He is re-reading ``The Coming Soviet Crash.''
   ``Most movies and TV today are so bad that I don't see them
much, except for an occasional mystery rerun such as `Barnaby
Jones,''' the former president said.
   Nixon's ninth book is scheduled for publication in April.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday rejected a request by
Imelda Marcos for reams of classified government documents for use
in her racketeering trial.
   The widow deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos had
asked to review papers from a U.S. government interagency task
force her lawyers claimed was assembled to investigate her and her
husband.
   But U.S. District Judge John Keenan ruled there was no such
wide-ranging investigation and therefore she had no right to see
any classified documents.
   Mrs. Marcos is scheduled for trial March 13 on charges she and
her husband embezzled more than $100 million from the Philippine
treasury to buy art and New York real estate. They also were
charged with defrauding banks of $165 million.
   Marcos died in exile in Hawaii on Sept. 28 at age 72.
   Mrs. Marcos had sought access to documents from more than a
dozen agencies, including the Departments of Justice, Defense and
Treasury; the offices of the president and vice president; the CIA,
FBI, National Security Agency, the Navy and the U.S. Embassy in
Manila.
   Prosecutors opposed the request, calling it a ``fishing
expedition.'' The judge noted that the prosecution had already
turned over to Mrs. Marcos about 350,000 documents, videotapes and
other items seized in its investigation.
   He said ``voluminous'' documents from the Internal Revenue
Service, the FBI, the U.S. Agency for International Development and
the Customs Service also were made available to the defense.

<HEAD>U.S. Panel Urges Cooperation Against Airliner Bombings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. presidential panel urged closer Western
cooperation Thursday to prevent airliner bombings and called for a
tough response to nations sponsoring such attacks.
   Ann McLaughlin, former U.S. labor secretary and head of the
commission, said at a news conference that a ``common purpose
exists to combat terrorism'' and called for more sharing of
information to protect travelers.
   President Bush created the commission on Aviation, Security and
Terrorism in August as a result of the Dec. 21, 1988 bombing of Pan
Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   The seven-member panel is traveling through Europe to sound out
anti-terrorism policies.
   At the news conference, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey
Democrat, urged Western governments to strike back at any state
proved to be involved in terrorist attacks on aviation.
   ``We have to let these states know we mean business,'' he said.
   Investigators have suggested there might be an Iranian
connection to the Lockerbie bombing, which killed all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground. The jet was bound for New York.
   In the Sept. 19 bombing of a French UTA jumbo jet over Niger,
investigators say they are convinced a Middle Eastern state was
involved. French press reports have said it could be Libya.
   Members of the commission said they did not go into specifics of
the UTA crash with French officials. But they said the fact that
both nations shared a similar tragedy made their conversations more
intensive.
   Another commission member, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York
Republican, said U.S. and French officials agreed that security at
African airports was a ``gaping hole'' that must fixed.
   France has announced a $20 million program to improve security
at African airports. The UTA flight, in which 170 people died,
originated in Brazzaville, Congo and stopped in N'Djamena, Chad.
   McLaughlin said it was too early to give any indication of what
recommendations the group would make to Bush. Their report is due
in mid-May.
   ``We'll come up with something or we will have failed,'' she
said. ``We can't leave the impression the terrorists are winning.''
   The group visited Charles De Gaulle airport to look at French
security measures, baggage handling and passenger check-in
procedures. They said they also discussed new technology aimed at
examining baggage to search for explosives.

<HEAD>Report Says Fathers Living Near A-Plants Could Cause Leukemia
Births</HEAD>

   A new study published Thursday said high rates of
leukemia in young people living near nuclear plants may be caused
by radiation doses their fathers received before they were born.
   The government said it was concerned and would refer the
findings to its committee of experts on radiation for urgent
consideration.
   Men who work at nuclear plants, particularly those who received
high radiation doses in the six months before their children's
conception, had more offspring with leukemia than men in other
jobs, said the study published in the British Medical Journal.
   One researcher, radiotherapist Michael Snee, said the radiation
probably caused a mutation in the fathers' sperm.
   The researchers' study, headed by Martin Gardner, professor of
medical studies at the University of Southampton, examined 52
victims of leukemia and lymphoma under 25 years old, born in the
West Cumbria health district and diagnosed between 1950-85. They
were compared with 1,001 control children.
   The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant, which has been
plagued by radioactive leaks, is in the district on England's
northwest coast. Government studies have found a 10-fold increase
in childhood leukemia a mile from the plant.
   One study, by the Medical Research Council and the Imperial
Research Fund, reported in November that an increased risk of
leukemia is not associated with exposure to radiation, with the
possible exception of the Sellafield plant.
   ``The main finding was of a raised risk for those children whose
fathers worked at Sellafield, in particular fathers with the
highest recorded exposures to external ionizing radiation before
their child's conception,'' Gardner told a news conference.
   ``The risk was raised by sixfold to eightfold for fathers who
had received total doses of over 100 millisieverts (msv).''
   One millisievert equals half an individual's annual dose from
natural radiation, or 50 times the dose received during a single
chest X-ray.
   When researchers focused on the village of Seascale near
Sellafield, they found that the fathers of four of the five victims
of leukemia and one lymphoma sufferer were employed at the plant
and had higher radiation doses before their child's conception than
all their matched controls.
   Gardner said other theories about concentrated high rates of
leukemia, such as viral infections, did not apply to the Sellafield
area.
   Junior health minister Roger Freeman said the government noted
the results with concern and ``recognizes the anxieties it must
cause to those who might be at risk.''
   He said the findings were referred to the govenment-appointed
Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment for
urgent consideration and advice.
   The Atomic Energy Authority, the government body responsible for
Britain's nuclear industry, said Gardner's study conflicts with
previous studies, and said more research is needed.
   ``We will need to study this detailed report with care ...
particularly as it does not seem to be emerging from other
studies,'' said Chairman John Collier. ``There are many leukemia
clusters distant from nuclear sites which cannot yet be explained,
so research must continue.''
   The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment
said in 1988 the high levels of leukemia might also be due to
exposure to chemicals, viruses or even chance.
   Martin Bobrow, a geneticist on the committee, called the latest
findings a ``very important step forward.''
   He said larger studies would be needed to confirm the results,
but the idea that a cancer-causing gene mutation could be passed
from father to child was theoretically possible.
   ``These children would then have a head start in terms of
developing leukemia,'' Bobrow said.
   British Nuclear Fuels PLC, which owns the Sellafield plant, said
Gardner's conclusions were unexpected, and backed the call for
further study.
   A spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said the conclusions conflicted with evidence from the
Japanese victims of the World War II atomic bombs. Gardner's
researchers attributed the conflict to the short but intense burst
of radiation at Hiroshima and Nagaski vs. the long-term radiation
experience by nuclear plant workers.
   Leukemia clusters _ occurrences of the disease statistically
higher than normal _ have also been found in southern England near
the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment, the Royal Ordnance
Factory and the Atomic Energy Authority.

<HEAD>Latvian Parliament Condemns Soviet Annexation Act of 1940</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Latvian parliament on Thursday condemned the
1940 declaration that made the Baltic republic part of the Soviet
Union, Tass reported.
   The parliament, or Supreme Soviet, said the declaration was
taken without making clear the will of the people and led to loss
of Latvia's independence.
   The vote was 177-40, with 33 deputies abstaining or absent, said
Valdis Birzens of the Latvian Popular Front newspaper Atmoda.
   The parliament also voted to restore the red-and-white flag and
the national anthem of independent Latvia, Birzens said. The
independence flag replaces one with the Communist hammer and sickle
emblem.
   The action follows a similar but stronger resolution in the
Parliament of neighboring Lithuania last week. Lithuanian lawmakers
declared ``unlawful and invalid'' the 1940 act that incorporated
their republic into the Soviet Union. They demanded talks with the
Kremlin on restoring Lithuanian independence.
   All three Baltic republics, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, say
they were forced to join the Soviet Union while occupied by the Red
Army.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, described the Lithuanian
action as a step toward full secession.
   The Latvian parliament also said Thursday that measures must be
taken to transform Latvia into a free and independent state in a
union of states, following a path of humane, democratic socialism
and building its own relations with other states on a foundation of
agreements, Tass said.
   Some Latvians want a completely independent nation. Others would
rewrite the treaty to allow the Kremlin limited powers in Latvia
while keeping most of the authority in Riga, the Latvian capital.
   Lithuanians enjoy an 80 percent majority in their homeland, but
immigration from other parts of the Soviet Union has left Latvia
with a population only half native Latvian.

<TEXT>
   More than 3,000 bottles of an antibiotic
distributed by Goldline Laboratories, doxycycline hyclate, are
being recalled because one bottle was found to contain a muscle
relaxant, federal officials said Thursday.
   Doxycycline hyclate is used to treat a wide range of infections,
including venereal diseases, acne and life-threatening pneumonia.
   The Food and Drug Administration said the mislabeled muscle
relaxant, carisoprodol, could harm patients because it would not
treat their infections and could impair their mental and physical
abilities, making it dangerous to drive a car or operate heavy
machinery.
   The recalled bottles of Goldline doxycycline hyclate 100
milligrams are in six lots. The bottles carry lot numbers 824039,
844059, 863069, 882079, 883079 and 919099.
   The carisoprodol tablets are white and round with the Bolar
Pharmaceutical Co. Inc. logo on one side _ a ``b'' over an inverted
``b'' _ and the number 0094 stamped on the other side.
   The FDA said patients who find that they have the mislabeled
product should stop using it, contact their physicians and return
the prescription to their pharmacy.
   The distributor, Goldline Laboratories, discovered the
mislabeled antibiotic and notified Bolar, the supplier, which is
voluntarily recalling the drug, according to the FDA.
   Bolar said more than 3,000 bottles may be in the hands of
pharmacists or consumers.
   The Copiague, N.Y.-based Bolar has been under fire for giving
false test data to the government. It has recalled many of its
products, including its largest seller, a generic version of the
anti-hypertensive drug Dyzaide.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the doxycycline recall did not
appear to be linked to Bolar's other problems with the agency.

<HEAD>Ag Department Announces Program to Curb Food-Poisoning Organism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department on Thursday
announced a stepped-up program to help curb the spread of a
food-poisoning organism in poultry flocks that produce table eggs
for consumers.
   Salmonella enteritidis, which has a number of strains, has been
identified with food poisoning in humans who have eaten improperly
cooked contaminated eggs.
   Assistant Secretary Jo Ann R. Smith said the $6.8 million
control program will focus on testing and certification of breeding
flocks that produce the table-egg layers, and on tracing and
testing commercial egg flocks if and when they are implicated in
human cases of salmonella enteritidis.
   The interstate movement of chickens, eggs and associated
articles from flocks infected or associated with the bacteria will
be restricted, she said.
   Smith said the organism is a growing problem in the nation's
$3.2 billion egg industry, ``and has emerged as a serious public
health concern as well.''
   Strains of the organism are entrenched in Northeastern and
Mid-Atlantic states and are expanding into the Midwest and
Northwest, she said.
   In humans, the bacteria can cause cramps, diarrhea, fever, and
sometimes nausea and vomiting five to 72 hours after eating
contaminated food. Smith said some people, such as the elderly or
those with poor immune systems, can suffer serious and
life-threatening effects from eating contaminated eggs or other
food.
   An interim rule will put the program into effect Friday, Smith
said. Public comments, accepted through April 17, may be sent to:
Chief, Regulatory Analysis and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room
866, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Md. 20782.

<HEAD>Telltale Sex Tape Found Inside Stolen VCR; Burglar Victim Jailed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of a homemade child-sex tape in
a stolen videocassette recorder led to the arrest of the VCR owner
on charges of molesting a 9-year-old neighbor girl, authorities
said Thursday.
   Ward Rafay, 28, was arraigned Wednesday on nine counts of child
molestation and one of possessing a kilogram of marijuana for sale,
and was being held on $50,000 bail.
   Two weeks ago, Rafay told police that a VCR was stolen from his
apartment in Downey, 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Deputy District Attorney Dean Shotwell said the thief sold the VCR
with the telltale tape inside.
   The buyer recognized the girl on the tape and arranged through
another party for the tape to be turned over to the girl's mother,
he said. Authorities do not know the identities of the thief or the
buyer.
   Rafay was arrested hours after the enraged mother contacted
police.
   ``The mother of the victim notified us Saturday that she had a
tape depicting immoral acts with her children,'' said Downey police
Detective Capt. Bob Williams.
   He refused to give other details of the case, saying, ``We don't
want to hamper the investigation. We have a possibility of possibly
three other victims.''
   The two-hour tape shows Rafay discussing sex with a child,
winning her cooperation and engaging in sexual acts with her,
according to police.
   If convicted of all charges, Rafay faces up to 25 years in
prison.
   The mother's identity wasn't revealed, but Shotwell said she
lives with her daughter in the same building as Rafay. The
prosecutor said there were no other suspects, but Williams said,
``We are looking at other people.''
   In addition to the tape taken with the VCR, police seized nine
other tapes from Rafay's apartment, Williams said. Shotwell said
those tapes didn't reveal any crimes but one contains some evidence.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano erupted anew Thursday,
sending a jet of ash and steam nearly seven miles high and
scattering grit that led authorities to cancel classes for 2,000
students.
   The ``moderate to strong'' eruption, the first significant
eruption since Jan. 15, began around 4 a.m. and was over in minutes.
   The ash cloud headed for the Gulf of Alaska, away from the more
populated Cook Inlet area, said Tom Miller, a spokesman for the
U.S. Geological Survey.
   The Federal Aviation Administration warned aircraft to stay at
least 20 miles from the mountain, which is about 115 miles
southeast of Anchorage.
   But Ken Burdette, manager of Anchorage International Airport,
said no airline had canceled or diverted flights because of the
ash, which can damage or shut down aircraft engines.
   ``Redoubt should not affect any carriers, international and
domestic,'' Burdette said. ``The cloud's going away from the major
airways that come and go into Anchorage.''
   Classes were canceled for health reasons at more than a dozen
schools from Nikiski southward on the Kenai Peninsula, which got a
``pretty good dumping'' of ash, said Dale Sandahl, superintendent
of the Kenai Peninsula Borough School District.
   The mountain was quiet for 25 years until a series of eruptions
began in mid-December, disrupting air travel in and out of
Anchorage during the holidays. Ash clogged all four engines of a
KLM Boeing 747 on Dec. 15, causing the aircraft to fall more than
two miles before the engines could be restarted.
   Redoubt showed more earthquake activity a couple of days ago,
leading seismologists to believe another eruption was coming, said
John Davies, state seismologist. ``But not this soon,'' he said.
   More than two dozen workers were evacuated early Thursday from
the Drift River oil terminal, a tank farm just a few miles from the
mountain.
   ``We got them out just before the eruption,'' said Larry
Duncanson, with Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co. which operates the storage
terminal.

   Foreign Minister Robert Ouko was reported
missing Thursday and the government media appealed to anyone with
information about him to contact the police.
   Ouko, 68, was last seen Tuesday at his farm in Koru, 215 miles
northwest of the capital, government radio and television said.
   The broadcasts quoted unidentified family members as saying Ouko
had said Monday night he planned to travel to Nairobi the following
day, but no one saw him leave.
   ``People are wondering how a full minister can disappear,'' a
senior government official said. ``At the moment we have no idea
what might have happened to him.''
   Cabinet ministers in Kenya are routinely assigned official
vehicles and drivers and their homes are always guarded by armed
policemen.
   In a three-paragraph statement, the official Kenya News Agency
urged Ouko to contact his family or the nearest police station. The
government-owned radio and TV broadcast an appeal from the
minister's family members urging Ouko either to contact them or
government officials.
   President Daniel arap Moi first appointed Ouko foreign minister
in 1979. Ouko served in other ministries before returning to the
renamed ministry of foreign affairs and international cooperation
in March last year.

   The last traces of oil from an
eight-day-old tanker spill washed ashore Thursday, but the
blackened coastline was still off limits to beachgoers and boaters.
   ``We don't want to paint too pretty of a picture,'' said Coast
Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall. ``We don't want to give the
impression we'll open up all these areas. I can't really say it's
done and over.''
   The 400,000-gallon spill, which occurred Feb. 7 when the tanker
American Trader apparently punctured itself on its own anchor, has
soiled a 12- to 14-mile stretch of beach. Cleanup crews were
focusing on the Huntington Beach and Newport Beach areas, where
concentrations were thickest.
   Warning signs remained posted along the sand, and booms placed
to guard against drifting oil continued to block entrances to the
Long Beach Marina, Newport Harbor and Santa Ana River, Hall said.
   With only a light sheen of oil remaining offshore Thursday,
experts considered reducing resources, said James L. O'Brien,
clean-up coordinator for British Petroleum America Inc., which had
leased the tanker.
   Equipment such as skimmers, which are useful only when oil is
thickly concentrated offshore, might be released, O'Brien said. He
said any such decisions would be made in consultation with local,
state and federal agencies.
   O'Brien, owner of an oil spill cleanup firm, declined to
estimate when work would be finished. ``This early in the game, it
would be bad for me to even try to predict,'' he said.
   About 36 percent of the oil, some 144,600 gallons, was recovered
through skimming, according to the Coast Guard. Forty-six percent,
or 184,800 gallons, was estimated to have evaporated or dispersed
in the ocean.
   A claims office was set up in Huntington Beach on Wednesday to
field calls from fishermen, charter boat owners and others whose
livelihoods have been disrupted by the spill.
   ``We've had the freshest fish for years ,'' said Mike Steven
Long, a line baiter with Dory Fleet, a cooperative of 20 fishermen
at Newport Beach. ``But now our reputation is ruined.''
   Wildlife experts said the environmental impact would be
short-lived.
   ``This is not an environmental disaster,'' said John Grant, a
marine biologist with the state Department of Fish and Game. Two
wetland areas populated by endangered species were protected from
the oil.

   A man was sentenced to life in prison Thursday
for the murder of his girlfriend's 4-year-old son, who was beaten,
burned, stuck with pins and forced to hang upside down in a closet.
The woman was sentenced to life for letting it happen.
   In sentencing Johnny Campbell and Alicia Abraham, Circuit Judge
Michael B. Getty said if he had let emotions dictate his actions,
the two would have received the death penalty for ``the vicious,
brutally sadistic torture and murder of Lattie McGee.''
   But he said he could not do so under Illinois law. The life
sentences carry no possibility of parole. The couple also received
30-year sentences for the abuse of Lattie's brother, Cornelius.
   Lattie, described as a quiet boy with dark eyes, died in 1987 of
a severe blow to the head, authorities said.
   In the last 2{ months of his life, Lattie was starved, burned
with a hot iron, stuck with pins and needles, singed with
cigarettes, beaten with a tree branch, hair brush, belt and hands,
scalded with hot water, and tied up with a clothesline in the
family's South Side apartment.
   Cornelius, now 8, testified that Campbell tied Lattie's wrists
to his ankles and hung him upside down in the closet. Once,
Cornelius said, his mother helped tie up Lattie. Cornelius, too,
was tied up in the closet, once for two days, he said.
   He told about seeing Campbell throw a screaming Lattie into a
bathtub of hot water, scrubbing the boy with a rag until his skin
started peeling off.
   Campbell, a 40-year-old former steelworker, pleaded guilty but
mentally ill in December. He said he beat the boys to curb what he
thought was homosexual behavior.
   Ms. Abraham, 28, contended she never actively abused the
children. Getty convicted her in a non-jury trial Jan. 11.
   Prosecutors had argued that death was the only just penalty for
the defendants. But Getty said the evidence that Campbell is
mentally ill and that Ms. Abraham had not participated directly in
the death made them ineligible for the death penalty.
   Clyde Lemons Jr., Ms. Abraham's attorney, called the sentence
unfair and said he would appeal. But Marijane Placek, Campbell's
lawyer, praised the judge for sparing her client's life and added,
``If you kill a sick person, you never find out why they did it.''
   Among the spectators was Lattie McGee Sr., the boys' father, who
lived with Ms. Abraham several years ago and now has custody of
Cornelius.
   ``I got justice today. I wish he did get the death penalty,''
said McGee.

   Price supports for peanuts grown under 1990
quotas will be $631.47 per ton, an increase of $15.60 from last
year, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Officials said the increase was mandated by law, which requires
annual adjustments in the national support level for quota-type
peanuts based on costs of production. As costs increase, so does
the peanut support level.
   Production of non-quota peanuts, which can be grown for peanut
oil and meal, and for export, will be supported at $149.75 per ton,
unchanged from last year.
   The Bush administration has asked Congress to eliminate the
escalator in the peanut support formula and put the program in line
with other farm commodity supports.

<HEAD>Study Says Most Targeted Companies Have Reduced Use of Animals in
Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most companies targeted by animal rights
groups for their use of animal testing in consumer product research
have significantly reduced their use of animals, according to a
private study released Thursday.
   However, a leading animal rights group said it wants
corporations to release internal information to back up the
findings.
   ``I would challenge the companies to substantiate the claims
that the numbers are down,'' said Susan Rich, special projects
director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the
nation's largest animal rights group.
   ``By looking at the figures of animal use in their in-house
laboratories does not give us the true picture,'' Rich said.
   The report by the Investor Responsibility Research Center
examines data submitted to the Agriculture Department by U.S.
companies reporting animal use in fiscal years 1986, 1987 and 1988.
   It also offers in-depth profiles of animal testing from 1984-88
of nine companies that introduced shareholder resolutions on animal
testing after being targeted by PETA.
   The study shows six of nine companies targeted by PETA cut
animal testing by 42 percent from 1986-88.
   Two of the companies _ Avon and Greyhound _ say they no longer
use animal testing for cosmetic and household product research, the
report said.
   Other companies highlighted in the study were American Home
Products, Bristol-Myers Products, Colgate-Palmolive, Gillette,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Proctor &amp; Gamble and Schering-Plough, which
produces Maybelline cosmetics.
   Only American Home Products showed no reduction in animal
testing during the period. Bristol-Myers had an increase from 597
to 743 tests between 1987 and 1988 after an earlier decline.
   The study said Gillette closed its in-house laboratory in March
1987 and declined to reveal how many animals have been used in
testing by contracted outside labs in 1988. Figures for 1988 also
were unavailable for Schering-Plough.
   ``We have not increased the number of animals just to increase
the animals,'' said Carol Emerling, spokeswoman for American Home
Products. ``The kinds of drugs and number of drugs that we're
testing dictates the amount of testing that we do.''
   She said most of the company's testing is for pharmaceutical
products where she said elimination of animal testing is not likely.
   The study said companies are turning to non-animal methods of
testing.
   Heidi Welsh, author of the IRRC study, said USDA reporting
requirements don't cover ``rats and mice _ an estimated 80 to 90
percent of all animal use _ and do not include animals uses at
contract laboratories.''
   Consumer product testing studied by IRRC included toxicity
testing of non-medical-related cosmetic and household products such
as soaps and eyeshadow.
   Over-the-counter and prescription drug testing was not included.
   Cosmetic and household testing account for ``less than 10
percent of the estimated 20-70 million laboratory animals'' used
annually in the United States, Welsh said.
   In a related matter, PETA on Thursday filed a $3 million lawsuit
against writer Katie McCabe for an article on animal testing in the
February issue of ``Washingtonian'' magazine. The organization
alleged that the story showed ``malicious intent'' to damage its
reputation.
   ``In 25 years of publication, we've never lost a suit for
anything we've published,'' said Washingtonian editor Jack Limpert.
``We're confident and we'll fight ... and win.''
   IRRC is a non-profit corporation established in 1972 to do
independent research for institutional investors interested in
proxy voting.

Czechoslovakia on Feb. 26 and an agreement on complete Soviet
withdrawal from Hungary may come within a month, officials said
Thursday.
   Gen. Anton Slimak, Czechoslovak chief of staff, said the Soviet
withdrawal would begin next week in Bruntal, 160 miles east of
Prague, the official news agency CTK reported.
   Later, however, CTK said Soviet and Czechoslovak delegations
meeting in Prague agreed the withdrawal would begin Feb. 26, the
day President Vaclav Havel starts his first visit to Moscow.
   Czechoslovakia had sought total withdrawal by the end of this
year, but Slimak said that would not happen. Moscow wants until the
end of 1991, and sources in Prague said earlier this week June 1991
was a likely compromise.
   No final date was agreed at Thursday's talks in Prague, but
talks will continue ``in the nearest future'' to nail that down,
CTK said.
   In Budapest, a senior Hungarian official was quoted as
predicting agreement within a month on ending decades of Soviet
military presence.
   Soviet soldiers arrived in Hungary to suppress the 1956
anti-Stalinist uprising and in Czechoslovakia to crush the ``Prague
Spring'' political liberalization of 1968.
   With their first free elections in more than 40 years nearing,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia are on the threshold of full democracy
and see removal of Soviet forces as a symbolic affirmation of
independence.
   Havel hinted Tuesday that a personal letter he received from
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev might help resolve the question
of how soon all 73,500 Red Army soldiers would be out of
Czechoslovakia.
   Talks on the withdrawal began in Prague in January. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Lubos Dobrovsky told journalists Tuesday a
deadline agreement could be reached by Sunday, which means Havel
could sign it when he goes to Moscow after a visit to Washington.
   Magyar Nemzet, a Hungarian daily, quoted Foreign Ministry
official Ferenc Somogyi as saying Hungary could ``count on working
out the agreement within a month.''
   Czechoslovakia has insisted the Soviets withdraw whatever the
results of East-West talks in Vienna on reducing conventional
forces in Europe, but Hungary has not.
   Officials on both sides appear confident of a Vienna agreement
this year, now that the Soviets have accepted President Bush's
proposal to reduce the number of U.S. and Soviet soldiers in
Central Europe to 195,000 for each side.
   Hungary wants all 50,000 Soviet soldiers off its territory by
early 1991, but Somogyi said compromise was possible because of
Kremlin concerns about transportation and providing facilities for
the returning soldiers.
   ``We have to take into account our negotiating partner's
position,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Slimak said withdrawal from Czechoslovakia could not be
completed by the end of 1990 for technical and social reasons.
   Both governments have mentioned the bottleneck likely to be
created by withdrawing large numbers of soldiers from neighboring
countries simultaneously through one Soviet border point, where
trains would have to be changed because of different track widths.
   Soviet officials also cite a lack of housing for most of the
16,000 families of Soviet soldiers and civil workers based in
Czechoslovakia, Slimak said.
   A preliminary agreement indicates about 35 percent of the
soldiers will be withdrawn by the end of May, along with 40 percent
of the tanks, 30 percent of other combat vehicles and nearly
one-third of helicopters and artillery, he said.
   Czechoslovakia has asked that a substantial part of the Soviet
forces be out before elections scheduled for June.

   ``The Donald'' wasn't talking, though the press
tried to catch him walking. And Thomas ``Hit Man'' Hearns made a
prediction Thursday you can take to the bank: a Trump will win in
Trump vs. Trump.
   Donald Trump experienced the same media crush his wife, Ivana,
was treated to on Wednesday when a pack of reporters and TV cameras
dogged her outside a fancy restaurant.
   Like Ivana, Trump said nothing. Surrounded by beefy,
serious-looking security men, the developer-casino operator-airline
owner was kept at arms length from the press before and after a
news conference at his Plaza Hotel.
   The topic was the April 28 Hearns vs. Michael Olajide fight at
Trump's new ``$1 billion baby,'' the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic
City, N.J., but it was obvious more than a few of those on hand
were boxing neophytes.
   Trump referred to the unusually large number of reporters,
telling Hearns, ``It's a great turnout for you, Tommy.''
   The dapper megabuilder said nothing specific about the breakup
of his 13-year marriage, though innuendos flew.
   Hearns' manager, Emanuel Steward, referred to Trump as ``The
Donald,'' Ivana's pet name for her husband, saying: ``I want to
thank `The Donald' for getting the crowd out for us today.''
   But the most profound statement came from Hearns, who was asked
who he thought would win in Trump vs. Trump, a battle with Trump's
estimated $1.7 billion fortune at stake.
   ``A Trump is gonna win somewhere,'' he said.
   Trump, 43, moved out of his penthouse apartment Sunday amid
reports he was involved with 26-year-old actress-model Marla
Maples, whom a source said he met at the church where the Trumps
were wed.
   Ms. Maples has not commented on the Trump split. but her agent,
Chuck Jones, denies she's involved.
   Maples' father, Stan Maples of Cohutta, Ga., said Thursday that
his daughter won't be hurt by all the publicity.
   ``This is not a big staging to boost her career,'' he also told
the Atlanta Journal, refusing to confirm or deny that his daughter
is involved with Trump.
   Rumors also have circulated that Trump was involved with skater
Peggy Fleming, but she angrily denied those reports. Fleming, 41,
convened a news conference Wednesday in Los Gatos, Calif., the
suburb where she lives with her husband and two children.
   ``I've been around Donald Trump four times in my life,'' she
said. ``We had a business relationship. I wouldn't even call him a
good friend.''
   A prenuptial agreement calls for Ivana to receive $25 million,
custody of the couple's three children and the mansion in
Connecticut. But Mrs. Trump wants more.
   New York Newsday quoted Trump associates as saying Trump planned
to up the ante to $100 million. That report was flatly denied by
Trump's lawyers, Jay Goldberg and Stanford Lotwin, who added in a
statement that the pre-nuptial is ``ironclad.''
   Mrs. Trump's spokesman, John Scanlon, was out of the office and
could not immediately be reached for comment.

   President Bush complained testily
Thursday about news accounts which he said portrayed him as
deceptive, declaring he would hold fewer news conferences and
initiate a ``new approach'' toward reporters.
   ``From now on, it's going to be a little different. ... So we've
got a new relationship,'' Bush told reporters traveling with him
aboard Air Force One to the four-nation Colombia drug summit.
   ``It will be pleasant. It will be fun. But it's different,''
said the president, who has averaged one question and answer
session with reporters each week since taking office 13 months ago.
   Later, Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said the
president was ``just kidding'' in asserting that he would have
fewer news conferences and in declining comment on a series of
questions.
   ``He was having fun,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president, who apparently read a wire service account of his
testy mood on the plane, protested to reporters later: ``I'm not
fuming.''
   Bush's pique apparently was triggered by an ABC-TV report
Wednesday night recapping instances in which Bush's words were
belied by subsequent events. The president was criticized on the
same score in a Feb. 26 article in The New Republic entitled, ``The
Deceiving Line.''
   Most recently Bush told a news conference on Monday that it
wasn't time yet for a conference among the United States, the
Soviet Union, Britain and France on the future status of Germany.
``Not at this juncture,'' he told the news conference.
   Yet, the next day, a major agreement was announced in Ottawa by
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on a German reunification
push that would include a summit among the four powers that
vanquished Germany in World War II.
   ``When I told you ... that I didn't think there'd be a deal and
there shortly was a deal, then I'm hit for deceiving you,'' Bush
groused Thursday.
   Bush, a onetime CIA director, has conducted much of his foreign
policy in secrecy.
   Two missions to China by national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft came despite a Bush announcement in the aftermath of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown that he was barring high-level exchanges
between the two countries. The president later insisted that
Scowcroft's trips to Beijing were ``visits'' and not ``exchanges,''
and thus not covered by the Bush edict.
   Bush, who usually maintains a bantering relationship with
reporters, said, ``I think we've had too many press conferences. It
overdoes it. It's overexposure.''
   By answering few questions directly, he said, ``I'm not going to
be burned for holding out or doing something deceptive.''
   The president, who slept the night before on Air Force One so he
would be well-rested for Thursday's pre-dawn flight here, even gave
a prickly response when asked if he had gotten a good night's sleep.
   ``I had a very good night's sleep. I can't get into the details
of that because some will say it's too much sleep, some will say
it's too little. ...,'' he said.
   Bush parried a series of questions from reporters, most of them
dealing with the drug summit.
   ``I'm not going to discuss what I'm going to bring up,'' Bush
said when asked about his agenda for the day's conference in
Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   ``I'm not going to discuss whether there's any surprises or not.
This is a new thing. This is a new approach.''
   He then said his non-answers were ``a trial run'' for later
dealings with the media.
   In fact, Bush, who answers reporters questions about once a
week, planned to finish his day in Colombia with yet another news
conference.
   Bush's comments with reporters came shortly before his jet
touched down here, where a U.S. press center was set up at the
airport. Bush flew by helicopter the 60 miles to Cartagena and was
returning here before flying home to Washington.
   Asked about an NBC-TV report that Colombian President Virgilio
Barco had made a deal with some drug lords in his country not to
extradite them to the United States if they turned over drug labs,
Bush snapped: ``I have no comment whatsoever on that. I have no
comment on whether I know about it or not. I can't comment on
whether it's true or not.''
   Bush did not mention which particular news reports had irked him
the most.
   However, Thursday's editions of the Washington Post had a story
on what it called ``the debate between President Bush and the press
over secrecy and deception.''
   And ABC-TV had a news report on Wednesday night by White House
correspondent Brit Hume on the same subject.
   Hume was one of several reporters invited to a recent off the
record lunch at the White House with Bush, at which the subject
reportedly came up.
   News accounts said that Bush told the reporters at the lunch
that he had undertaken no further secret diplomatic missions _ like
Scowcroft's clandestine visits to China.
   Then, the next day, it was disclosed that Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger had gone on a secret mission to London
to notify U.S. allies of Bush's latest plan to reduce troops in
Europe.
   Bush also gave what some have seen as misleading comments on his
surprise seaside summit at Malta in December with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The president in September had said that there were no plans for
a superpower summit before 1990, but he later revealed that the
session had been arranged as early as last July.

<HEAD>Defense in Murder Case Won't Dispute Defendant's Identity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A defense attorney has acknowledged for
the first time that his client, arrested seven months ago, is John
List, the subject of a worldwide manhunt after the 1971 slayings of
five members of his family.
   A prosecutor said Thursday that will make no difference in the
case against List, who was arrested on a tip after an ``America's
Wanted'' TV broadcast that included a plaster bust of how he might
look 17 years after the slayings.
   ``We've got to prove the identity anyway,'' said Assistant
Prosecutor Brian D. Gillet.
   List is charged with murder in the 1971 slayings of his mother,
wife and three children in their 19-room Westfield home.
   He was arrested in June in suburban Richmond, Va., but told
authorities he was Robert P. Clark. His second wife, Delores, said
her husband was a victim of mistaken identity.
   But investigators identified List through fingerprints from his
Army record.
   List's attorney, Elijah Miller Jr., said at a hearing Wednesday
that the defendant's identity was not at issue. ``The only thing we
said before was that they (the state) had to prove it was John
List,'' said Miller. ``Now they don't have to prove it.''
   The FBI and prosecutors maintain that List assumed a new
identity after the slayings, working as an accountant in Colorado
and Virginia. He remarried in 1983 and was known to neighbors as a
quiet, church-going man.
   The defense is seeking to keep prosecutors from using as
evidence a five-page letter in which List is alleged to have
confessed to his church pastor that he killed his family because
they were veering away from God.
   Miller contends the letter should not be allowed into evidence
because of the confidentiality that exists ``between priest and
penitent.''
   Jury selection begins March 20.

<HEAD>Survey Says Many Hospitals Lack Policy for AIDS Testing of
Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Preliminary results of a survey show that many
hospitals fail to protect patients' rights when trying to determine
whether patients are infected with the AIDS virus, researchers said
Thursday.
   ``If you are about to be admitted to a hospital, ask your doctor
what he intends to do with the blood he draws, and if he plans to
test for AIDS, what he intends to do with the results,'' said Dr.
Charles E. Lewis, who analyzed the results of the survey.
   Lewis, a professor of medicine, public health and nursing at the
University of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said
around 17 percent of hospitals don't have policies to protect
patients' rights on the AIDS issue, and of those that do, ``a
distressing proportion'' are inadequate.
   Lewis declined to say how many are inadquate or discuss some
other aspects of the study because his analysis of the data has not
been published.
   He and one of his co-workers on the survey, Howard E. Freeman,
who has a doctorate in sociology and is a professor at UCLA,
discussed some of their preliminary results at an AIDS conference.
   The survey of 716 hospitals, about 14 percent of the nation's
non-federal, short-term general hospitals, was conducted between
January and August of last year by Louis Harris &amp; Associates of New
York.
   Lewis said about half the hospital administrators surveyed were
unaware of the guidelines put out by the federal Centers for
Disease Control, which recommend that hospitals establish policies.
The CDC guidelines also recommend that if hospitals test patients
for HIV, they first get their consent.
   Freeman said the survey found that about 15 percent of hospitals
do not always inform patients they will be tested for the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS, and a third do
not always counsel a patient about the disease before they are
tested.
   About 4 percent of the hospitals surveyed don't always inform
patients of HIV test results, and two-thirds of the facilities put
the results in the patient's file, he said.
   In addition, about a quarter of the hospitals said they
sometimes or always transfer to another hospital patients
identified as being HIV positive, he said. Some hospitals say the
reason for transfer is that they are not familiar with HIV and AIDS
treatment procedures, and other say they are concerned about
transmission of the virus to hospital workers.
   Freeman said that while precautions must be taken to guard
against hospital workers becoming infected through contact with an
infected patient's blood, the chances of transmission are small.
   ``It has more to do with ... fright and fear of the virus,'' he
said.

   Rain, snow and freezing rain fell over much of the nation
Thursday, snarling traffic and weighing down power lines, and
temperatures hit record lows in the West and record highs in the
Deep South.
   Freezing rain over the central section of the Texas Panhandle
changed to snow over western sections of the Panhandle, and snow
extended across northeastern New Mexico, eastern Colorado, eastern
Wyoming, western Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and North Dakota,
the National Weather Service said.
   Snow was scattered over eastern Idaho, and reached from northern
Idaho and the Idaho Panhandle to the Washington and Oregon coasts.
Snow changed to rain at lower elevations along the northern Pacific
Coast.
   Freezing rain, ice and a mixture of rain with snow extended from
southern New England to northern New Jersey, northeastern
Pennsylvania, southern and central New York state, southern Lower
Michigan, northern Indiana, southern Iowa, northern Missouri and
northeastern Kansas.
   Winter weather watches extending into Friday were posted for
northern Maine, Upper Michigan, the northwestern half of Wisconsin,
northeastern Minnesota, much of Nevada, and the Sierra Nevada and
northeastern plateau of California.
   A warning of an overnight hard freeze was posted for the deserts
of southwestern and south-central Arizona.
   At midday, showers and thunderstorms extended from eastern
Louisiana to Mississippi, the northwestern half of Alabama, eastern
Tennessee and Kentucky.
   A tornado touched down east of Mere, La., damaging a mobile home
and slightly injuring three people.
   In Mississippi, hail about the size of nickels fell west of
Newton, half-inch diameter hail fell at Union and thunderstorm
gusts causes damage near Union, the weather service said.
   Showers reached across northern West Virginia, northern
Maryland, southern New Jersey, much of Pennsylvania, Ohio, much of
Indiana, southern Illinois, much of Missouri, northern and central
Arkansas, southeastern Oklahoma and north-central Texas.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to noon CST included
2.18 inches at Jonesboro, Ark.; 1.8 inches at Meridian, Miss.; 1.69
inches at Dyersburg, Tenn.; 1.43 inches at Fort Knox, Ky.; and 1.15
inches at Louisville, Ky.
   Temperatures dropped to record lows Thursday in northern
California: 25 degrees at Bakersfield, 24 at Fresno, 32 at Moffett,
29 at Sacramento airport, 30 at downtown Sacramento, 36 at San
Francisco, and 23 at Santa Maria. The previous record of 31 at
downtown Sacramento had been on the books since 1883.
   But the Gulf Coast basked in record heat, with 90 degrees at
Brownsville, Texas; 85 at San Antonio, Texas; and 83 at Shreveport,
La.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 2 below
zero at West Yellowstone, Mont., to 93 at McAllen, Texas.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 below zero at West
Yellowstone.

<HEAD>Strike Prompts Bulgaria to Halt Nuclear Plant Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist government on Thursday
ordered a halt to the construction on a nuclear power plant on the
Danube River after nearby residents staged a general strike.
   Also Thursday, Premier Andrei Lukanov met a delegation
representing 23,000 workers at Sofia's giant Kremikovtsi steel
plant who are threatening to walk off the job Monday in demand of
higher pay and better working conditions.
   The government news agency BTA said Lukanov planned to continue
the talks Friday at the plant, whose red smoke wafts across the
capital daily.
   The government ordered construction halted on the country's
planned second nuclear plant at Belene on the Danube, which is on
Bulgaria's northern border with Romania.
   The decision came after reports that Svishtov, a town 18 miles
east of Belene, was paralyzed by a general strike Thursday in
protest of a parliamentary decision to continue building the plant.
   Public protest has flared over Belene because it is in an area
believed susceptible to earthquakes.
   A parliamentary commission traveled to Svischtov, 125 miles
northeast of Sofia, to try to calm public fears, government-run
media said.
   The new openness in Bulgaria's media, since hard-line leader
Todor Zhivkov was forced from power in November, has produced a
series of articles about mishaps at the country's currently
operating but trouble-plagued nuclear plant at Kozloduy. The plant,
75 miles north of Sofia, also lies on the Danube.
   Construction work on Belene, which like Kozloduy is based on a
Soviet design, has just begun. About 9,000 people work at the site.

   Chicagoans danced a winter ballet Thursday amid
inhospitable weather that made the hardiest Midwesterners leap to
avoid slush puddles, shuffle to keep from slipping on ice and dive
to escape bus splashes.
   ``This is treacherous,'' John Peeples said as he failed in a
daring attempt to jump a slush puddle. ``I feel like I'm
maneuvering through an obstacle course.''
   Chicagoans, like residents of other parts of the Midwest, spent
much of their day digging out from up to 10 inches of snow that
began falling on Valentine's Day. The storm stranded many
commuters, knocked down power lines and briefly closed both major
city airports.
   Rain started falling Thursday afternoon.
   ``There's cold. There's snow. There's rain. And here's where I'm
going to stay today,'' said John Renier, pointing to his home in
the city's Lincoln Park neighborhood.
   Renier, a native of Arkansas, said this was his first winter in
Chicago in which snow forced him to shovel out his walk and his
car, both buried under a mountain of snow.
   ``I was really looking forward to the first time I would have to
shovel this,'' he said as a fine rain fell. ``I can see I haven't
missed much.''
   Farther down the block, University of Chicago law student Ken
Simpler frustrated many neighbors struggling to dig their cars out
of the snow when he jumped into his four-wheel-drive vehicle and
pulled right out.
   ``This thing is good two seasons of the year _ one, when it
snows like this, and then in the summer when I can take the top off
and enjoy myself,'' he said.
   The storm ended an unusually balmy six-week period, when
temperatures rose above freezing almost daily, occasionally
climbing into the 60s.
   Restaurant owners in the city and suburbs lamented the foul
weather that sent potential customers scurrying for the comforts of
home.
   ``It was more like the Valentine's Day Massacre,'' said Denise
Ellis, coordinator of the dining room at Kendall College culinary
school and restaurant in north suburban Evanston.
   ``It's normally one of our busiest days of the year and we had
only 17 couples all night,'' Ms. Ellis said in a telephone
interview. ``And I think we got lucky because we're near people's
homes. I'm sure the downtown (Chicago) restaurants did even worse.''
   Hardier Midwesterners, however, claimed the storm was just a
drop in the bucket compared to other bad weather.
   ``Now, the snowstorm in '67, that was something!'' said
Josephine Woods of Rogers Park as she stood on an elevated train
platform lecturing other morning commuters on the proper way to
dress in such conditions.
   ``There's nothing nobody can do about the snow, but you've got
to try to wear enough clothes to keep you warm,'' said Ms. Woods,
who pointed to the two jackets she wore on top of a full-length ski
suit and thermal underwear.
   Bill Lederer of Lincoln Park took the day off from work to enjoy
a little cross-country skiing after spending seven hours trying to
get home from work the previous evening.
   ``It's normally an hour drive,'' Lederer said, miniature icicles
hanging from his cap. ``But I don't think this is so bad.
   ``It relieves the monotony of winter and gives everybody
something to talk about.''

<TEXT>
   Presidents at the drug summit on Thursday
called anew for Latin American farmers who grow coca to switch to
other crops. But Bolivian authorities have tried that for years and
found it a tough row to hoe.
   It has been only recently that the program here showed signs of
progress.
   President Jaime Paz Zamora, who attended the meeting in
Cartagena, Colombia, says ``coca leaf must be reduced in exchange
for development.''
   ``It is not just a question of substituting one hectare of coca
for oranges or coffee, but the development of the country because
coca is an integral part of the economy.
   ``It means transforming Bolivia economically so that it will no
longer depend on coca-leaf farming and cocaine production for a
large share of its export earnings.''
   A hectare is slightly less than 2{ acres. Coca leaf is the raw
material that becomes cocaine after processing.
   In their communique on the war-on-drugs, presidents Bush, Paz,
Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Alan Garcia of Peru noted that
persuading Andean farmers to turn from coca production to legal
crops would have ``significant, immediate and long-term economic
costs'' on Colombia, Peru and Bolivia.
   It said Bush pledged to request an economic aid package from
Congress for fiscal 1991 to 1994 to help offset these losses.
   Bolivian farmers have begun in recent months to eradicate
significant numbers of coca plants, but only after increased drug
enforcement programs in Colombia and Bolivia led to a sharp drop in
coca-leaf prices.
   The United States believes the two policies must go
hand-in-hand: urging farmers to grow substitute crops, and cracking
down on the illegal drug trade itself.
   The Chapare is a tropical region in the heart of Bolivia that
produces an estimated one-third of the leaf used to make cocaine.
Past efforts to eradicate coca plants there failed. Farmers were
unwilling to switch to other crops that were not profitable and for
which markets did not exist.
   Before Colombia began its drug crackdown last August, farmers
destroyed an average of 200 hectares _ 494 acres _ of coca a month
under the Bolivian crop substitution program.
   But the overall area devoted to coca cultivation increased from
34,135 hectares in 1988 to 38,250 hectares in 1989, U.S. government
figures indicate.
   Farmers harvested four crops of coca leaf a year and had no
problem marketing their leaves to coca paste producers. Coca paste
is flown from the Chapare to northern Bolivia, Colombia or Brazil
where it is processed into cocaine base, which becomes refined into
pure cocaine.
   Following the crackdown in Colombia, however, and an intense
cocaine interdiction program in Bolivia, farmers have been unable
to sell their leaves to paste producers and traffickers. As a
result, coca-leaf prices have fallen and farmers are flocking in
increasing numbers to government agencies to sign up for crop
substitution programs.
   In December and January farmers destroyed 1,266 hectares of coca
in exchange for $2,000 for every hectare destroyed.
   In early February, 100 pounds of coca leaf was selling for $5 to
$8 while the cost of production is estimated at $30.
   The U.S. ambassador to Bolivia, Robert S. Gelbard, told The
Associated Press on Thursday:
   ``The fact that the voluntary eradication program has begun to
show significant progress in the last two months proves that
interdiction, eradication and alternative development programs are
three interdependent parts of an integrated strategy and must be
pursued simultaneously and with equal strength.''

   The president said the United States will provide $2.2 billion
worth of aid over a five year period to help underwrite the drug
war and to promote crop substitution in the Andean coca growing
nations.
   At his airport news conference, Bush said he had told the other
leaders that the United States is making headway in dealing with
drug demand at home. He said ``I'm not satisfied with it,'' but the
situation is improving.
   The president said he will work with the Latin American
coca-producing countries to encourage other crops. ``These
economies are hurting because of the kind of export problems they
are encountering,'' he said. But he said trade problems are not
one-sided, that they involve the United States as an importing
nation, too. Bush said none of that should be an excuse for growing
the illegal crop behind cocaine.
   Bush's security against the possibility of terrorist attack by
the drug cartel had overshadowed the drug meeting in the days
before it was held; the president said he'd had full confidence in
his safety all along. At his final appearance in Colombia, Bush
said he wasn't surprised that the journey and the meeting had been
secure and without incident.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina and Britain agreed Thursday to
restore full diplomatic relations nearly eight years after they
fought a 74-day war over the Falkland Islands.
   After two days of talks in Madrid, the announcement was read in
Spanish by Lucio del Solar, ambassador at large for Argentina, and
in English by Sir Crispin Tickell, British ambassador to the United
Nations.
   Britain agreed to lift a 150-mile military protection zone it
has enforced around the South Atlantic islands since a task force
sent by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher defeated Argentine
invaders in June 1982.
   New security arrangements for the archipelago 300 miles off
Argentina's southeast coast, which are home to about 1,900 people
and thousands of sheep, are to involve advance notice by both sides
of military maneuvers in the area.
   The presence of an estimated 2,000 British soldiers at Mount
Pleasant outside Port Stanley, the Falklands capital, was not
mentioned in Thursday's agreement, although Argentina had
previously called for a reduction.
   Argentina and Britain also agreed to consult on relations
between the European Economic Community and Latin America, and to
establish a Working Group on South Atlantic Affairs.
   In London, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said of the agreement:
``It underlines the fact that we have no quarrel with Argentina,
and this has been achieved without any sacrifice of sovereignty. So
it's a very good agreement and I hope it's a turning point and will
lead to a new relationship.''
   President Carlos Menem of Argentina told reporters in Buenos
Aires: ``Everything is resolved. Aside from having eliminated _
definitively, I believe _ the possibilities of an armed conflict,
it opens wide possibilities for us in the ... European Economic
Community.''
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, declared:
``I very much welcome the decision by both governments to
re-establish diplomatic relations. This immediately creates an
atmosphere of confidence.''
   The battle for the South Atlantic islands, which Argentina calls
the Malvinas, cost the lives of 712 Argentines, 255 Britons and
three islanders. Dissatisfaction over the war, which Argentina's
military government claimed to be winning until shortly before the
surrender, contributed to the end in 1983 of nearly eight years of
military rule.
   Thursday's agreement stiplulated that talks would continue on
fishing rights and that the International Red Cross would arrange
visits by Argentines to war cemeteries in the Falklands.
   Garcia del Solar called the accord ``very satisfactory,'' and
Tickell said the decision to end the military zone by the end of
March ``set a new base for relations between our two countries.''
   ``There is no secret understanding, no confidential
memorandum,'' he said. ``It's all here.''
   A breakthrough in October provide for renewed consular ties,
resumption of air and maritime links and moves toward lifting all
trade restrictions.
   By mutual consent, the latest talks did not touch on sovereignty
claims.
   Britain says it colonized the islands in 1766 when John MacBride
founded Port Egmont. Spain gained control but permitted the British
to remain until 1774, then abandoned the islands when it ceased to
govern Argentina in 1810.
   Argentina traces its claim in the Treaty of Tordesillas, which
assigned New World territories to Spain and Portugal in 1494. It
says the British occupied the islands by force in 1833 when Capt.
John Onslow expelled the Argentine population.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Doubts About Social Security Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of working American adults do not
believe Social Security will be able to pay them benefits when they
retire, according to a survey released Thursday by a private
research institute.
   The December survey of 1,001 adults found that 49 percent of
those who had not yet retired were confident Social Security would
be able to pay them benefits, 47 percent did not expect to get
benefits and 4 percent were unsure.
   The survey, conducted by The Gallup Organization, was
commissioned and released by the Employee Benefit Research
Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan research group.
   The institute's president, Dallas Salisbury, said the results
indicate people are ``unrealistically pessimistic'' about the
Social Security system, and that they have not been well educated
about how it works.
   Salisbury said confidence in Social Security could drop further
as public debate continues on a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to cut Social Security taxes to keep the
government from using Social Security revenue for general
government operations.
   The debate ``is bringing into question the ability of the system
to pay future benefits,'' Salisbury said.
   President Bush has criticized the Moynihan proposal and claims
that it could jeopardize benefits for future retirees.
   The survey found that confidence in Social Security benefits was
highest among those who were closest to retirement, with 76 percent
of those aged 55 and older expecting to receive benefits compared
with 46 percent of those aged 18-34.
   In other results, 50 percent of those who had not yet retired
planned to retire by age 62, and 11 percent said they planned to
retire by age 50. Just 29 percent were aware that the age at which
full retirement benefits are paid gradually will rise from 65 to 67
beginning in the year 2000.
   The survey also found that 53 percent of those who had not yet
retired planned to continue working after they begin collecting
Social Security benefits. However, 18 percent of those people
changed their minds after being advised that Social Security
benefits are reduced for workers whose earnings exceed a specific
threshold, $9,360 in 1990.
   The survey had a margin of uncertainty of about three percentage
points either way.

   Store owners in Israel, Australia and Switzerland
pulled bottles of Perrier sparkling water from the shelves Thursday
as a general worldwide recall got under way.
   But beverage industry analysts remained divided about whether
the tony brand in the distinctive green bottle will ever recover
its prestige.
   The recall affects 160 million bottles of the water in 120
countries and could cost the company up to 200 million francs, or
$35 million, officials said.
   Perrier President Gustave Leven announced the worldwide recall
Wednesday after traces of the cancer-causing chemical benzene were
found in recent weeks in some bottles shipped to the United States,
Canada, West Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.
   Premier Michel Rocard saluted Perrier's move to withdraw some
160 million bottles of its water from sale as ``a courageous
decision.''
   Marketing and beverage experts in the United States disagreed on
whether the brand will be able to recover.
   ``The answer is a qualified `Yes,''' said Neil Berlant, managing
partner of Water Research Associates, a Los Angeles-based merchant
banking firm specializing in investment in the water industry.
   The qualification, he said, was that ``they don't determine that
the problem is indeed with the spring.''
   Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark Inc., a management consulting
company based in Los Angeles, said the company's altered
explanation of what caused the contamination of some of its bottles
hurt chances for recovery.
   Company officials initially attributed the contamination with
benzene to cleaning equipment that had been cleaned improperly, but
later in the week said it resulted from a dirty filter that was
designed to remove benzene.
   ``We do a lot of work in the water business, and I don't know of
any single source with benzene in it,'' Pirko said. ``I think
Perrier has seen its day.''
   Jesse Meyers, who publishes the newsletter Beverage Digest in
Greenwich, Conn., said that barring any new negative surprises in
the recall story, the brand could come back stronger than ever.
   ``I think Perrier has done as much as any company could in
eliminating the problem,'' Meyers said.
   In another development, the investigative Commission des
Operations de Bourse announced that analysis of heavy options
trading volume in the company's shares last Friday turned up no
evidence of insider trading.
   Perrier bottles had been pulled from the shelves in the United
States, Canada, West Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands before
Wednesday's general recall. Bottles were also withdrawn in Japan as
a precautionary measure.
   On Thursday, thousands of bottles were taken off the shelves in
Switzerland and Israel when health officials in those countries
said traces of benzene had been found in test samples.
   The water's Australian distributor, Coca-Cola Amatil, withdrew a
further 960,000 bottles to comply with the recall, though tests for
benzene had not been completed.
   Benzene, a chemical used in cleaning solvents, turned up in
tests on Perrier water run by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
early this month and prompted a weekend recall of 72 million
bottles.
   Managing Director Frederik Zimmer of Perrier said Wednesday that
benzene entered the bottled water due to a dirty pipe filter at the
underground spring at Vergeze in southern France.
   The company separates the water from natural carbon dioxide gas
in the spring and both are piped separately to the bottling plant,
where the gas is reinjected into the water, Zimmer said.
   A filter on the gas line that cleans the carbon dioxide of small
amounts of naturally occurring benzene was not changed for several
months, Zimmer said, allowing traces of benzene to slip through.
   The filter should be replaced every six weeks, Zimmer said,
blaming negligence by workers. Zimmer said investigators found the
filter was the cause of the benzene traces on Sunday.
   Other company officials had said Monday that contamination
occurred when a worker used benzene solvents to degrease equipment.
Zimmer said that was false.
   The company waited three days to notify the public of how the
benzene entered the bottled water because it wished to run further
tests and be sure of its evidence, Zimmer said.
   Perrier has advised distributors to dispose of the water on site
and return the bottles to France, where they will be cleaned,
refilled with fresh water, dated and exported. The company hopes to
be back to normal on the global market in 2{ months.

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Barry Indicted on 5 Drug Charges, 3 Perjury
Counts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry was indicted Thursday on
eight charges of possessing crack cocaine and lying repeatedly to a
federal grand jury questioning him about drug use. ``I know that
when a trial is held I will be exonerated,'' Barry declared.
   Barry was undergoing treatment at a Florida substance abuse
clinic when the grand jury returned the indictment to a federal
magistrate. He enrolled in the clinic after his arrest last month
in what authorities say was a videotaped hotel drug sting.
   He said in a statement that the indictment ``represents a
continuation of the political lynching and excesses that the
Justice Department in this multi-year, multi-million dollar effort
to investigate me and the Barry administration.
   Barry said he had no plans to resign. His lawyer, R. Kenneth
Mundy, said Barry would return from Florida for arraignment within
10 days and plead innocent.
   Mundy said the charges ``aren't as devastating, as harsh as I
expected them to be'' but that a felony conviction would be
``disastrous'' for the mayor.
   In the face of rumors that have dogged him the past several
years, Barry steadfastly denied ever using drugs. In his statement
Thursday, Barry said he was undergoing treatment for ``the disease
of alcoholism.''
   Only one of the charges filed Thursday stems from the videotaped
hotel room encounter between Barry and Rasheeda Moore, a one-time
Barry girlfriend who is cooperating with investigators. The other
charges result from his association with Charles Lewis, who has
pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges.
   The 14-month investigation has focused on Barry's ties to Lewis.
   Barry has told top political aides he would abandon his hopes
for a fourth term, but sources close to the mayor have said he
would refrain from making any quick public statement about his
political future any time soon.
   The mayor has turned the day-to-day operations of the District
of Columbia government over to a top deputy.
   The felony perjury counts all stem from questions a grand jury
asked him about visits to Lewis' Washington hotel room in December
1988; four of the five misdemeanor possession charges result from
the same investigation. The fifth possession count represents the
formal lodging of a charge in connection with his Jan. 18 cocaine
possession arrest.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said of the perjury charges, ``Mr.
Barry falsely testified ... that he was unaware of any narcotics
activity by Mr. Charles Lewis, when he stated that Mr. Lewis had
never given him, Mr. Barry, any narcotics, and when he stated that
he, Mr. Barry, had never given any narcotics to Mr. Lewis.''
   Stephens would not take questionsafter reading a brief statement
to reporters.
   Each of the three false declaration charges carries a five-year
maximum prison term and a maximum fine of $250,000. Each possesion
charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in a jail and a fine
of $100,000.
   If convicted of a felony, the 53-year-old mayor would be
required to resign, with city council chairman David Clarke
becoming acting mayor. A special election would be held within 120
days of any resignation, unless that date fell within 60 days of
the regularly scheduled Nov. 6 general election.
   Clarke, one of four announced Democratic candidates vying for
Barry's job, described the legal developments as ``a tragedy for
Marion and for the city.''
   Jesse Jackson also has been considered a possible candidate for
the post but has said he will not run against Barry.
   Since his arrest, Barry's political support in the city has
dwindled and several supporters have urged him not to seek another
term. There also have been calls for his resignation.
   Council member Betty Ann Kane said the grand jury indictment
``certainly undermines all the excuses being made that this was
some sort of plot by the U.S. attorney to get the mayor,'' and she
said Barry's resignation ``might be in his best interests and the
city's best interests.''
   Stephens has said the investigation of Barry began in December
1988 after city police aborted an attempt to make an undercover
drug purchase from Lewis, a longtime friend of the mayor, after
learning Barry was in Lewis' room.
   Lewis, who pleaded guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges last
November, testified that he supplied Barry with crack cocaine. He
agreed to cooperate with the probe when prosecutors offered to drop
more serious drug charges against him.
   Rumors of Barry drug use have followed him for much of the past
decade.
   In one episode, convicted cocaine dealer Karen Johnson was
jailed in 1984 for eight months for contempt of court after
refusing to tell a grand jury whether she used drugs with Barry or
sold them to the mayor or other top city officials.
   Barry, who is married, acknowledged having a ``personal''
relationship with Johnson, but denied using drugs with her.
   Another woman, Maria McCarthy, of Greensboro, N.C., was jailed
for contempt of court on Tuesday after refusing to testify about
her relationship with Barry, according to her attorney.
   Throughout, Barry steadfastly, and sometimes angrily, rejected
all questions or suggestions that he was involved with drugs.
   When he announced that he was entering the Hanley-Hazelden
Clinic, the mayor only said that he was ``taking steps to heal my
body, mind and soul.''

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands marching against government
austerity measures fled in panic Thursday when police fired rifles
and tear gas after hooded youths smashed store windows. Three
people were injured, police said.
   The violence came 11 months after rioting left about 300 dead
following protests over subsidy cuts on food and public
transportation.
   About 8,000 union members and supporters marched in the capital
while thousands of others marched across the country in protest of
government reforms aimed at cutting a $34 billion foreign debt,
fourth-largest in Latin America.
   The march in Caracas was interrupted when a group of adolescents
overturned garbage cans and shouted insults at police. About 20 of
the youths began breaking windows in Simon Bolivar Center, a
complex on Plaza Caracas, where the march was to end.
   Police rushed in firing tear gas and shotgun blasts in the air.
Three people were injured in the brief confrontation, including
Rafael Calma, a photographer for a Caracas newspaper, hit by a
bottle thrown by a bystander in the crowd, said police.
   Police did not say how the other two people were hurt.
   ``It was the same group of troublemakers. A small group. We
acted responsibly,'' said metropolitan police sheriff L.B. Gomez,
standing his ground as protesters chanted, ``Police off our
streets! The streets are ours!''
   ``It's the fault of the government's economic package,'' said a
leftist congressman, Ricardo Guttierez, participating in the march.
   The march was called by the 4 million-member Confederation of
Workers, CTV, Venezuela's largest umbrella labor group.
   The CTV has called on President Carlos Andres Perez to back off
on austerity measures it says has hit poorer Venezuelans the
hardest.
   Labor leaders have planned protests this month after Perez'
year-old Social Democratic government planned to cut subsidies on
gasoline.
   The economy last year contracted by 8.1 percent and inflation
rose to 80 percent under the effects of the austerity measures.
Unemployment is about 11 percent, according to independent
estimates, up from 8.7 percent last year.

<HEAD>2. MITIGATION OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE FIGHT
AGAINST ILLICIT DRUG TRAFFICKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   As the Andean Parties implement or continue to develop effective
programs of interdiction of the flow of illicit drugs and of crop
eradication, they will need assistance of the fast disbursement
type to mitigate both small- and large-scale social and economic
costs. The Parties will cooperate to identify the type of
assistance required. The United States is prepared to provide
balance of payments support to help meet foreign exchange needs.
   The United States will also consider funding for emergency
social programs, such as the successful one in Bolivia, to provide
employment and other opportunities to the poor directly affected by
the fight against illicit drugs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>3. TRADE INITIATIVES, INCENTIVES TO EXPORTS AND PRIVATE FOREIGN
INVESTMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An increase in trade and private investment is essential to
facilitate sustained economic growth and to help offset the
economic dislocations resulting from any effective program against
illicit drugs. The Parties will work together to increase trade
among the three Andean countries and the United States, effectively
facilitating access to the United States market and strengthening
export promotion, including identification, development and
marketing of new export products. The United States will also
consider providing appropriate technical and financial assistance
to help Andean agricultural products comply with the admission
requirements.
   The Parties may consider the establishment of economic and
investment policies, as well as legislation and regulations to
foster private investment. Where favorable conditions exist, the
United States will facilitate private investment in the three
Andean countries, taking into account the particular conditions and
potential of each.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>B. UNDERSTANDING REGARDING ATTACKING ILLICIT DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Parties reaffirm their will to fight drug trafficking in a
comprehensive manner attacking all facets of the trade: Production,
transportation and consumption. Such comprehensive action includes
the following:
   Preventive actions to reduce consumption and therefore demand.
   Control and law enforcement activities against illegal
cultivation, processing, and marketing of illicit drugs.
   Control of essential chemicals for the production of illegal
drugs and the means used for their transport.
   Seizure, forfeiture, and sharing of illegal proceeds and
property used in committing narcotics-related crimes.
   Coordination of law enforcement agencies, the military,
prosecutors and courts, within the framework of national
sovereignty of each of the Parties.
   Actions to bring about a net reduction in the illegal
cultivation of coca.
   The Parties undertake to engage in an ongoing evaluation of
their cooperation, so that the President of the United States, as
appropriate, may request Congress to provide additional assistance
to the Andean Parties.
   Given that the Parties act within a framework of respect for
human rights, they reaffirm that nothing would do more to undermine
the war on drugs than disregard for human rights by participants in
the effort.

   The Parties undertake to support development and expansion of
programs in comprehensive prevention, such as preventive public
education in both rural and urban areas, treatment of drug addicts,
and information to encourage the public opposition to illegal drug
production, trade and consumption. These programs are fundamental
if the drug problem is to be successfully confronted.

<TEXT>
   The Parties recognize that prevention efforts in the four
countries will benefit from shared information about successful
prevention programs and from bilateral and multilateral cooperation
agreements to expand efforts in this field.
   To this end, the Parties undertake to contribute economic,
material and technical resources to support such comprehensive
prevention programs.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>2. INTERDICTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A battle against an illicit product must focus on the demand
for, production of and trade in that product. Interdiction of
illegal drugs, as they move from producer to consumer, is essential.
   The Parties pledge to step up efforts within their own countries
to interdict illegal drugs and to increase coordination and
cooperation among them to facilitate this fight. The United States
is ready to provide this fight. The United States is ready to
provide increased cooperation in equipment and training to the law
enforcement bodies of the Andean parties.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>3. INVOLVEMENT OF THE ARMED FORCES OF THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The control of illegal trafficking in drugs is essentially a law
enforcement matter. However, because of its magnitude and the
different aspects involved, and in keeping with the sovereign
interest of each State and its own judicial system, the armed
forces in each of the countries, within their own territory and
national jurisdictions, may also participate. The Parties may
establish bilateral and multilateral understandings for cooperation
in accordance with their interests, needs and priorities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>4. INFORMATION SHARING AND INTELLIGENCE COOPERATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Parties commit themselves to a greater exchange of
information and intelligence in order to strengthen action by the
competent agencies. The Parties will pursue bilateral and
multilateral understandings on information and intelligence
cooperation, consistent with their national interests and
priorities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>5. ERADICATION AND DISCOURAGEMENT OF ILLICIT CROPS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eradication can play an essential part in the anti-drug fight of
each country. In each case, eradication programs have to be
carefully crafted, measuring their possible effect on total illicit
drug production in each country; their cost-benefit ratio relative
to other means of fighting illicit drugs; whether they can be most
effective as voluntary or compulsory programs or a combination of
the two; and their probable political and social consequences.
   The parties recognize that to eradicate illicit crops, the
participation of the growers themselves is desirable, adopting
measures that will help them obtain legal sources of income.
   New economic opportunities, such as programs for alternative
deveopment and crop substitution, shall be fostered to help to
dissuade growers from initiating or expanding illegal cultivation.
   Our goal is a sustained reduction in the total area under
illegal cultivation.
   Eradication programs must safeguard human heath and preserve the
ecosystem.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>6. CONTROL OF FINANCIAL ASSETS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The parties agree to identify, trace, freeze, seize, and apply
other legal procedures for the disposition of drug crime proceeds
in their respective countries, and to attack financial aspects of
the illicit drug trade. In accordance with their respective laws,
each of the parties will seek to adopt measures to define,
categorize, and criminalize money laundering, as well as to
increase efforts to implement current legislation. The parties
agree to establish
   formulas providing exceptions to banking secrecy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>7. FORFEITURE AND SHARING OF ILLEGAL DRUG PROCEEDS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The parties pledge to implement a system for forfeiture and
sharing of illegal drug profits and assets, and to establish
effective programs in this area.
   In United States cases related to forfeiture of property of
illegal drug traffickers where Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru provide
assistance to the United States government, the government of the
United States pledges to transfer to the assisting government such
forfeited property to the extent consistent with United States'
laws and regulations. The Parties will also seek asset-sharing
agreements for Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru with other countries.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>8. CONTROL OF ESSENTIAL CHEMICALS USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF
ILLICIT DRUGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The control in the United States of the export of chemical
substances used in the processing of cocaine is vital. In addition,
there is a need for greater control of the import and domestic
production of such substances by the Andean Parties. Joint efforts
must be coordinated to eliminate the illicit trade in such
substances.

   The Parties agree:
   -- to step up interdiction of the movements of essential
chemicals that have already entered the country, legally or
illegally, and are being diverted for illicit drug processing. This
includes controlling choke points as well as establishing
investigative and monitoring programs in close cooperation with all
the Parties' law enforcement agencies.
   -- to further develop an internal system to track essential
chemicals through sale, resale and distribution to the end user.
   -- to cooperate bilaterally and multilaterally to provide each
other with information necessary to track domestic and
international movements of essential chemicals for the purpose of
controlling their sale and use.
   -- to support the efforts under the Organization of American
States (OAS) auspices to develop and implement a regional
inter-American agreement on essential chemicals.

<HEAD>9. CONTROL OF WEAPONS, PLANES, SHIPS, EXPLOSIVES AND
COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT USED IN ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Illicit drug trafficking is heavily dependent on weapons,
explosives, communications equipment, and air, maritime and
riverine transportation throughout the illicit cultivation and the
production and distribution process.
   The Parties agree: to strengthen controls over the movement of
illegal weapons and explosives and over the sale, resale and the
registration of aircraft and maritime vessels in their respective
countries, which should be carried out by their own authorities.
   The Parties agree to establish wihtin their own territory
control programs that include: the registration of ships and
aircraft; the adoption of legal standards that permit effective
forfeiture of aircraft and vessels; controls on pilot licenses and
training; registration of airfields in their respective countries;
development of control measures over communications equipment used
in illegal drug trafficking to the extent permitted by their
respective laws and national interests.
   The United States agrees to work with the Andean Parties to stem
weapons exports from the United States to illegal drug traffickers
in the three Andean nations.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>10. LEGAL COOPERATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Parties pledge to cooperate in the sharing of instrumental
evidence in forms admissable by their judicial proceedings. The
Parties also agree to seek mechanisms that permit the exchange of
information on legislation and judicial decisions in order to
optimize legal proceedings against the traffic in illicit drugs.
   The Parties recognize the value of international cooperation in
strengthening the administration of justice, including the
protection of judges, judicial personnel, and other individuals who
take part in these proceedings.

<HEAD>C. UNDERSTANDINGS REGARDING DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND PUBLIC</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   OPINION
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The scourge of illicit drug trafficking and consumption respects
no borders, threatens national security, and erodes the economic
and social structures of our nations. It is essential to adopt and
carry out a comprehensive strategy to promote full awareness of the
destructive effects of illegal production, illicit trafficking and
the improper consumption of drugs. Toward this end, the Parties
commit themselves to use all political and economic means within
their power to put into effect programs aimed at achieving this
goal.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>1. STRENGTHENING PUBLIC OPINION IN FAVOR OF INTENSIFYING THE FIGHT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   AGAINST ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Public awareness should be enhanced by means of active and
determined diplomatic action. The Parties pledge to strengthen
plans for joint programs leading to te exchange of ideas,
experiences, and specialists in the field. The parties call upon
the international community to intensify a program of public
information stressing the danger of drug trafficking in all of its
phases. In this regard, the Parties undertake to give active
support to Inter-American public awareness and demand reduction
programs, and will support the development of a drug prevention
education plan at the Inter-American meeting in Quito this year.

<TEXT>
   ABC News anchorwoman Paula Zahn, bound for ``CBS
This Morning,'' said goodbye on the air Thursday to her ``Good
Morning America'' colleagues, not mentioning CBS but saying, ``I
have a wonderful opportunity to go into.''
   Although CBS had no comment on reports she is joining CBS News,
her agent, Richard Leibner, confirmed she is headed there. He
declined to elaborate.
   ``After a few tiny details are wrapped up, there's no question
that she'll be at CBS,'' said Leibner, who handled negotiations for
Diane Sawyer when she left CBS last year to join ABC as co-anchor
of ``Prime-Time Live.''
   Zahn's ABC contract ended Thursday. A source close to her
contract talks said ABC hoped she would stay there but didn't make
a counteroffer to CBS' bid, a four-year pact paying about $1.1
million annually.
   Zahn, who joined ABC News in the fall of 1987, has been
co-anchor of ``World News This Morning'' and the news segments of
``Good Morning America'' since May 1988. The latter program is
produced by ABC Entertainment.
   A source familiar with negotiations for her services said that
Zahn would succeed Kathleen Sullivan as co-anchor of the
bottom-rated ``CBS This Morning'' and probably would start work
Feb. 26.
   Friday will be Sullivan's last day on the program, according to
a memo sent staff members by the show's executive producer, Erik
Sorenson, who said Faith Daniels would be her temporary replacement
next week.
   In a statement, ABC News President Roone Arledge praised Zahn's
work and said, ``We wish her all the best in her new assignment.''
   ``ABC was terrific to her, she loved it there'' and appreciated
what Arledge and others did for her, Leibner said. ``But an
extraordinary opportunity doesn't come down the pike that often.
It's a sad departure to a new adventure.''
   Zahn's move to CBS has been expected ever since Ron Konecky,
Sullivan's agent, said last week that CBS is taking Sullivan off
``CBS This Morning.'' Sullivan and Harry Smith have been co-anchors
of the show since it began in 1987.
   In her farewell to viewers and ``Good Morning America'' co-host
Charles Gibson and weatherman Spencer Christian, Zahn said that it
had been ``an absolute pleasure'' working at ABC News.
   ``I have a wonderful opportunity to go into,'' she said. ``The
details are being worked out at this moment, so we can't really
talk specifically what they are about. You can expect the
announcement soon.''
   No replacement for her has been chosen, an ABC spokeswoman said.
   Zahn, a native of Naperville, Ill., previously was an anchor and
reporter at Los Angeles TV station KCBS, where Sullivan began in
1977. Zahn started her career a year later at WFAA-TV in Dallas.
   Sullivan's CBS contract expires in November. Konecky said last
week that CBS had given no specific reason why they wanted to
replace her and had set no date for her to leave. He said he was
discussing other possibilities for her at CBS.
   When Sullivan leaves the program, it will mark the second time
this year that a network anchorwoman has been replaced on a morning
program.
   In a controversial shift last month, Jane Pauley, co-host of
NBC's ``Today'' for 13 years, was succeeded by Deborah Norville.
The move hasn't helped that show in the ratings.
   According to A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings, ``Today'' last week was
second to ``Good Morning America'' for the sixth consecutive week.
   ABC's show averaged a 4.4 rating and ``Today'' 3.7. CBS' show,
third in ratings since it began, although doing better in the
Nielsens than its predecessor, ``The Morning Show,'' had a 2.7.
   Each rating point represents 921,000 homes.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's news conference following the drug summit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, we depart Cartagena having forged an
unprecedented alliance against the drug trade. This afternoon, my
colleagues, President Barco and President Garcia, President Paz
Zamora and I, signed the Document of Cartagena, which sets forth
the principles of this alliance.
   In signing the document, we've committed ourselves to the first
common, comprehensive international drug control strategy. We in
fact created the first anti-drug cartel.
   The document, which creates a flexible framework under which the
four of us will coordinate our activities, covers the major issues
of economic assistance, demand reduction, expanded law enforcement
and interdiction activities, the involvement of military resources,
where possible _ appropriate; and the control of precursor
chemicals, automatic weapons and other key components of the
narcotics trade; the pursuit of profits and sharing of seized
assets, and a commitment on the part of all of us to continue to
gather regularly to coordinate our activities.
   In addition to signing this Document of Cartagena, we begin the
process of executing bilateral agreements in support of the
document today. Secretary of State (James A.) Baker executed the
agreements with Peru on tax information exchange, public awareness
and extradition, and with Bolivia on public awareness and the
export of defense articles. Director (William) Bennett (of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy) executed a bilateral
agreement with Bolivia on the control of precursor chemicals.
   Equally important, the four of us today had an opportunity to
discuss in total candor the problem that illegal drug trafficking
and use presents to each of our societies.
   I also had the opportunity to review with my colleagues the
greatly expanded counter-narcotics activities of the U.S.
government. The $2.2 billion, five-year program to which the United
States is committed to support our partners in this struggle was
discussed in some detail.
   In addition, I had the opportunity to explain our plans to
expand the $7.5 billion inside the United States on treatment,
prevention, and criminal justice support. I believe they were
impressed with the major increase in resources which we've
committed to reducing demand in our country.
   I must say I also listened very carefully to the challenges that
each of the three countries face, and have come away with the new
ideas worthy of consideration with a better personal understanding
and appreciation of the problems that my allies face in this
struggle.
   And I cannot leave this beautiful country, Colombia, without
once again emphasizing that President Barco, and all of his
citizens who have joined him in this brave fight against drug
trafficking, are an inspiration to me, and an inspiration to the
American people. I came here today to make the point as clear as I
could that they do not, and will, not stand alone. They will have
the steady and sustained support of the United States. I want to
try to help them in the multilateral institutions, help President
Barco in asset sharing, and opening up markets as best we can.

   The United Nations has recognized that the problem of drug
trafficking presents a grave threat to the security of the states
and economic stability. It has called for a Global Action Plan and
it has convened a Special Session, February 20-23, 1990, to discuss
the magnitude of this problem. Ths will be a proper occasion to
reiterate the need to bring into force as quickly as possible the
UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Pyschotropic Substances, which provides for energetic measures
against illegal drug trafficking, while recognizing the ancestral
and traditional uses of coca leaf.
   The Parties request that consideration by given during the
Special Session to the inclusion of the cooperative efforts
outlined in this document to develop concrete programs for
strengthening multilateral responses to the drug problem, as
recommended in Resolution No. 44-141 of the United National General
Assembly.

   I want to thank him and his many colleagues for the most
hospitable arrangements that we encountered here in Barranquilla,
and over in Cartagena. It was a great pleasure to be here, albeit
very, very briefly. So thank you again President Barco, and I offer
you my profound appreciation for your steadfast efforts in the
fight against narcotics.
   I'll take just a few questions, because we're scooting on. Yeah,
Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, how long do you think it will take to replace
the coca plant, and how much will it cost?
   A: Well, I know we did not go into replacement cost, and I
expect any program that tries to shape their economy, to move it
out of planting which is very difficult for those governments to
control, is going to take some time. And I can't give you a time
estimate on that.
   Terry. And then we'll go _
   Q: Mr. President, are you surprised that the narco-terrorists
didn't strike today, that there was no either attack on you or any
bombing in this country just to register displeasure with your
visit?
   A: Well, you know, I got a question at the press conference over
there on security, and I want to thank not only the security people
here, but our own security people, Secret Service and others who
were concerned with the security of the President, and I am not
surprised.
   Yeah, Britt?
   Q: Mr. President, I gather you chose to _ not to raise today
that rather ticklish question of a U.S. Navy radar net somewhere
off the coast here. Why not, sir?
   A: Well, there was no discussion of a radar net. There was so
much misunderstanding over what was intended in the first time _
first place that it's not timely to do that. However, there was
discussion of interdiction and my reasserting to those countries,
all three of them, my intention to interdict narcotics coming into
this country. But there wasn't the _ the stories on the U.S. task
force were so distorted that I felt it was better to keep talking
in general terms about our military interdiction efforts, rather
than asking for support from any one of the three countries.
   Q: Do you feel now, after this meeting, that your understanding
with these leaders may have been enhanced to the point where you
might soon be able to raise that topic again?
   A: Well, it depends what _ in what way _ yes. Well, in the first
place, I feel the understanding is enhanced, and it was a frank
meeting. I mean, they were very frank with us on things that maybe
they wanted me to do more of or disagreed with, but I think that
the idea of working cooperatively for interdiction is very
important. You heard President Barco's answer there in _ at
Cartagena on that question. So we're not going to push. We're not
going to do something of that nature without a cooperative effort,
but there are efforts in terms of interdiction on the high seas
that the United States will continue to do.
   Yeah, these three right here _ these three.
   Q: Mr. President, you acknowledged in the document today that
the U.S. has a responsibility to help these economies wean
themselves from the drug trade. Do you see that responsibility as
job-for-job and dollar-and-dollar?
   A: No. But I see us making every effort we can to help
them,because they do have some severe problems. And I mention now
trying to help Colombia, for example, in the multilateral agencies,
for example. There's a lot of ways to try to help, but I don't
think it is a job-for-job kind of approach.

   I don't think we can do that. I don't think there's a way the
United States can do it, or that any of the individual leaders can
do it. We had a long discussion about the supply and demand of
cocaine, how market prices affect what the farmers do in Peru or
Bolivia. So it isn't a job-for-job question.
   Q: Mr. President, any successful interdiction strategy would
require increased military-to-military cooperation. Is the U.S.
already installing a ground radar system in Peru, I mean in Bolivia
or _ Colombia, I'm sorry _ or in any way helping the Colombians now
to install a ground radar system?
   A: No, but I'd have to defer that question to someow nothing of it,
but I know there was a report that was written
up that proved to be totally inaccurate because I was just told
that there was a report saying there was some 200 people building a
ground rbody here. I
knadar station. But I simply don't know it if there is, and
I'd be surprised, frankly.
   Q: Do you know to what extent the U.S. and Colombia are in fact
cooperating militarily now, in terms of interdiction efforts?
   A: Well I _ yes, I know that.
   Q: Can you share that with us.
   A: No. Next?
   Q: Why not, sir?
   A: Because I don't feel like it, and because some of the things
we do with Colombia, if I shared it with you, maybe the drug
narco-traffickers wo _ a disease that affects millions of Americans,
including such notable and courageous individuals as former first
lady Betty Ford.
   I have derived great benefit from my stay here at the alcohol
rehabilitation center in Florida, and I know that recovery is a
lifelong process to which I have dedicated myself.
   But for now, as I go through this healing process, I want to
make sure that my wife and our son are psychologically and
emotionally comfortable, after all that we have through and will be
going through, as a family. I do not want them badgered and dogged
at every turn. They do not suffer from the disease, I do. Any
consequences should be mine to bear, not theirs.
   I am extremely proud of the way my management team, headed by
City Administrator Carol Thompson, has handled the affairs of
government in my absence. I know this budget period is a tough time
for Carol; my staff director, Maudine Cooper; Deputy Mayors Bob
Pohlman and Wylie Williams; Director of Special Services, Tina
Smith; and the agency directors who must explain the serious
realities of the city's financial picture during an election year.
   I know citizens need assurance that their needs will be met, and
that the same high quality government services will continue
uninterrupted in spite of the mean-spirited and calculating people
who would like to see us fail as a local government. I put a strong
management team in place, and I can reassure you that government is
operating smoothly, efficiently and effectively _ and under the
Barry philosophy of quality, compassionate, competent, and caring
service.
   I want to say to all that when I decided to go away to deal with
my health concerns, my political decisions were placed on hold and
will be determined within the next 60 days. Anita Bonds is the only
person designated and authorized by me to speak on political
matters.
   My lawyer, Kenneth Mundy, and I are now preparing to go to court
and win this case. I will have no announcement about my political
future at this point.
   I hope the media will respect my right to continue my recovery,
in private, and allow me to obtain the full benefit of treatment
for this disease. During my absence, I urge you to respect the
rights of my wife and my son to lead private lives as we go forward
during this highly political legal procedure. I ask that you
confine your questions about the legal case to my attorney. Any
other questions about me should be directed to my press secretary,
Lurma Rackley.
   To all of you who continue to remember me, my family, and this

   Q: Mr. President, how can we expect the Bolivians and Peruvians
not to grow coca if we block their exports of flowers, citrus,
sugar?
   A: Well, I don't know if you heard the question. The question
is: How can we expect them not to grow coca if we have other trade
problems? And you mention sugar and flowers.
   I think the leaders here recognize that growing coca for the
international drug market is immoral and wrong. And I think they
believe that, and so they need assistance. If we have a flower
problem, and we do, I think we take 80 to 90 percent of the cut
flowers from Colombia _ we've got to try to help on it. I don't
know that we can solve it.
   Coffee is a major problem for Brazil and the other countries,
and we're trying _ I mean, for Colombia and also Brazil and the
other countries with whom we met _ (aside) please, just one minute.
I'm not going to get to you, I don't think, because this may be the
last one.
   And so we have to work with them very cooperatively, but _ in
trying to get a coffee agreement.
   But what I did get from these people, and I think I knew it
ahead of time but had it reinforced, was that these economies are
hurting because of the kinds of export problems they are
encountering. I have a problem in trying to explain it to them that
there's, you know, consumers in the United States, the largest
market for coffee, they don't necessarily want to pay higher prices
for it.
   The same for flowers. So, we've got _ what we did on the flowers
is explain the procedures at the Commerce Department and say that
we would try to help in negotiating that. But the point is it
shouldn't be linked to whether _ to whether people, you know,
condone the growing of a crop that is illegal and that they're
trying to stop, as a matter of fact.
   Q: Will you _
   Q: Mr. President, will you address that?
   A: (Inaudible.)
   Q: (Off mike) _ Europe and Japan in future negotiations?
   A: You're the guy. Yes! We're going to talk about that at the
G-7 (Group of Seven economic summit meeting) in Houston, just as we
did in Paris last year. It's a very important agenda item for the
G-7, and the more they get involved, because they're user
countries, the better it will be.
   So, I'll give a full report to the G-7 and other European
countries on this ice-breaking meeting here, and you can be sure it
will be on the agenda at the G-7 summit in Houston.
   Listen, thank you all very much. It's been a long day.

<HEAD>List 10 Best Cities for Working Moms _ Minneapolis-St Paul Best</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quality child care, good public schools and
abundant job prospects are among the attractions that put
Minneapolis-St. Paul at the head of Working Mother magazine's Top
10 list of U.S. metropolitan areas.
   The magazine published the rankings in its March issue
distributed to newsstands Thursday, saying the list was based on
exhaustive research into every major city in the United States.
   Working Mother said the Minnesota Twin Cities region was
especially attractive because the local government and business
community take an active role in helping families, particularly
with child care.
   The magazine said that Minneapolis and St. Paul, with their
longstanding tradition of political progressivism, have become a
mecca of business and government support for working parents.
   The other metropolitan areas on the list, ranked in order, are:
Pittsburgh; Raleigh, N.C.; Milwaukee; Orlando, Fla.; Seattle;
Phoenix; Boston; San Jose, Calif.; and San Francisco.
   The magazine said the last three on the list were considered
models in terms of progressive attitudes toward families with
working parents, but that their high cost of living made them
unaffordable for many.
   It said the criteria for judging included affordable, accessible
child care and a quality school system, after-school programs,
parks and other leisure-time facilities and a cost of living low
enough to make it feasible to enjoy short-term pleasures and save
for long-term goals like college.
   In addition, the magazine said, the cities were ranked based on
an abundance of job prospects, decent salary levels and employee
benefits, opportunities for career advancement, and the ``almost
intagible'' involvement of the business community as well as state
and local governments in quality-of-life and work issues.
   Working Mother, a 10-year-old magazine based in New York, has a
circulation of about 460,000.

<HEAD>35 Million Americans Have Arthritis; 6 Million Won't See Doctor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-five million Americans report suffering
from arthritis, and 6 million admit they haven't seen a doctor
about it, according to a survey released Thursday by federal health
officials.
   ``This confirms our suspicions that people are seeing
(pain-killer) ads on TV and treating their arthritis themselves _
and very possibly doing damage to themselves,'' said Steve
Erickson, spokesman for the Arthritis Foundation, based in Atlanta.
   The highest incidence of arthritis was in Florida, 18 percent,
while the lowest was in Alaska, 9 percent.
   More than 3,000 people were asked in 1987 if they had
experienced various arthritic conditions in the past year, if they
had consulted a physician about the condition and if their
arthritis was limiting their work or their household lives, the
national Centers for Disease Control said.
   Nationwide, the survey found, 14.6 percent of the population
reported arthritis and 12.1 percent had consulted a doctor about
it, leaving 2.5 percent _ about 6 million people _ who hadn't.
   The feeling that nothing can be done for arthritis, beyond
taking over-the-counter pain medication, ``is a real big
misconception,'' Erickson said. ``There are a lot of things you can
do.''
   The problem will probably get worse if pain relievers are the
only treatment, he said.
   ``These findings indicate the need ... to determine why these
persons have not sought medical care, and to identify approaches
for overcoming barriers to care,'' the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   Women reported higher rates of arthritis than men, 18 percent to
11 percent. Women also were more likely to have seen a doctor about
their arthritis _ 15 percent to 9 percent _ and were more likely to
report limits in their activity _ 4 percent to 2 percent.
   Overall, 3 percent said arthritis was limiting their activities.
   There was little racial difference in arthritis reporting: 15
percent for whites and 14 percent for blacks.
   As might be expected, arthritis rates increased with age. Eleven
percent of respondents aged 35-44 reported arthritis compared with
23 percent of those 45-54; by the 75-and-over group, the rate was
53 percent, compared to just 3 percent in the under-35 group.
   The high rate of arthritis in Florida ``is due to its relatively
large population of elderly persons,'' the CDC said.
   Alaska's low rate can be attributed in part to its high Native
American and Pacific Islander populations, ``among whom the
prevalence of arthritic conditions is low,'' the report said.
   Erickson said too few people are aware of the warning signs of
arthritis, such as joint swelling, early morning stiffness,
recurring joint pain or inability to move a joint that lasts for
more than two weeks. People with those symptoms should see a
doctor, the Arthritis Foundation said.

<HEAD>Military Officers Demand Resignation of Ceausescu Brass</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officers demanding the firing of
military leaders who served dictator Nicolai Ceausescu protested
for a fourth day Thursday, joined by more than 2,000 civilians.
   The officers said they would continue until the dismissal of
Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru, Interior Minister Mihai Chitac
and others who were in the military hierarchy before Ceausescu was
overthrown and executed in December.
   Fifty-eight officers who spent three nights inside government
headquarters on Victory Square left the building early Thursday
after Premier Petre Roman agreed to investigate Militaru and Chitac.
   They continued their protest outside and about 2,000 civilians
joined them late Thursday, including Hihai Stanescu, Romania's
best-known cartoonist. The crowd dwindled when heavy rain began.
   Alexandra Marielise Popescu, a 34-year-old translator who joined
the crowd with several friends, said: ``The army helped us in the
revolution and we must help them.
   ``We think they're in danger because of the Securitate,''
Ceausescu's secret police. ``They are trying to penetrate into the
old structure again, and to hold positions.''
   Silviu Brucan of the National Salvation Front, which took power
during the uprising, told The Associated Press the officers ``are
almost 80 percent right, but an army without discipline is not an
army and all officers should understand this.''
   Official media said seven Securitate officers were sentenced in
Sibiu, central Romania, for ``complicity in genocide'' by trying to
crush the revolution.
   Col. Iulian Rotariu, Securitate commander in Sibiu, got a
20-year prison sentence and sentences for the others ranged from 15
to 18 years.
   Sibiu was governed by Ceausescu's son Nicu, who was captured
Dec. 22. Authorities have said he will be tried, but he has not
been seen by the public since his arrest.
   Officers in Victory Square said similar protests were under way
in the western city of Timisoara, where the uprising began, and the
Black Sea port of Costanta.
   The Bucharest protest, which began Monday, was the military's
first challenge to the revolutionary government it helped create.
   Many officers said they felt the people's victory was threatened
because former Communists in the military were trying to protect
their positions.
   Roman said the new commission would investigate the role of
individual officers during the revolution and reconsider military
appointments and promotions made since Dec 22, the day Ceausescu
was overthrown. He was executed three days later.
   Dr. David Vasile, who has the military rank of lieutenant major,
said: ``Rapid measures should have been taken immediately after the
restoration of democracy to change all the top people in the
army.'' Vasile was charged with insubordination under Ceausescu for
refusing to obey orders.
   He said most of the top brass were agents of the Securitate or
cooperated with the agency. ``The interest they have now is to
cover themselves,'' he said.
   The officers have accused Interior Minister Chitac of being a
``direct participant'' in repressive actions in Timisoara, citing
unconfirmed reports that a videotape exists showing Chitac shooting
demonstrators.
   They accuse Militaru, who came out of retirement to be defense
minister, of creating ``a state of tension in the army,'' and
demand he be replaced by a civilian.

<HEAD>Court Convicts German Hackers of Selling Computer Codes to Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CELLE, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court convicted three West German
hackers on Thursday of selling Western military computer codes to
the Soviet KGB secret police, and gave them suspended sentences
ranging from 14 months to two years.
   Chief Judge Leopold Spiller said sentences were suspended
because ``it could not be proven that substantial damage had been
done to ... (West Germany) or its NATO partners'' through the
hackers' actions. But he also said the three purposely sold the
computer codes for money to the KGB.
   Court records show one defendant, Peter Carl, made at least 25
contacts with the Soviets and received $54,500 for the computer
information, which he split with the others.
   Carl, 35; computer specialist Dirk Brzezinski, 30; and computer
programmer Markus Hess, 28, were arrested in March 1989 after an
investigation by U.S. and West German officials revealed they had
obtained passwords and codes giving them access to major military
and research computers in the United States, Western Europe and
Japan.
   Carl drew 24 months; Hess, 20 months; and Brzezinski, 14 months.
   A fourth man, Karl Koch, 30, was arrested in the case, but
committed suicide last May.
   U.S. officials said last year that the hackers were stopped
short of obtaining any highly classified information.
   Investigators said at the time of the arrests that codes and
passwords for computers in Japan, Britain, France, Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany were also obtained and sold to the
Soviet by the hackers.
   All three defendants admitted guilt in obtaining codes to sell
to a Soviet KGB agent in East Berlin.
   At the trial, which began on Jan. 11, Carl testified he could
identify the agent only as ``Serge'' and said he did not wish to
reveal anything more about the Soviets in open court for fear of
reprisals.

   A 13-year-old boy injured in the crash of a
sightseeing helicopter last weekend died Thursday without regaining
consciousness, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Robert Faller and his father, Bernard, were among five people
aboard the helicopter when it plunged into the East River on
Saturday. The boy, strapped in his seat, was underwater for 20
minutes before divers reached him.
   The others, all adults, were rescued quickly, and escaped
serious injury.
   Robert suffered a heart attack, and was put on a respirator at
Bellevue Hospital. Doctors never tested for brain activity
``because his condition was too unstable,'' said Karen Crowe, a
Bellevue spokeswoman.
   The boy died at 10:42 a.m. Thursday, she said.
   The pilot of the helicopter, a Bell Jet Ranger 206-L operated by
Island Helicopter Corp., said he believed a gust of wind swung the
aircraft into the water as it lifted off from a riverside heliport.

<TEXT>
   Colombian officials and the U.S.
Embassy on Thursday denied press reports that the United States
sent radar equipment and troops to the city of Bucaramanga to
establish a radar network for drug interdiction efforts.
   However, Columbia and the United States last year announced they
were setting up a radar station on the Colombian Caribbean island
of San Andres to monitor air traffic, and equipment for that
station began arriving two months ago, according to an embassy
spokeswoman.
   The United States is ready to help set up a series of radar
stations in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru to interdict the small
planes that fly tons of cocaine into the United States each year, a
U.S. diplomat in Bogota told The Associated Press last week.
   The diplomat spoke on condition that he not be identified by
name.
   The diplomat said the United States had begun preliminary
discussions with the Latin American countries about setting up the
net, but added that the plan was still at an ``embryonic'' stage.
It was not on the table for President Bush's summit meeting
Thursday with the presidents of Peru, Bolivia and Columbia, he said.
   Crates unloaded by U.S. soldiers at Cartagena were not radar
equipment, as reported by NBC News, but medical supplies, said the
embassy spokeswoman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   She said the medical supplies brought in by military cargo plane
on Monday were for an agricultural corporation helping peasants in
the northeastern state of Santander.
   The president of the corporation, German Enrique Corzo,
confirmed the shipment was medical supplies, as did Colombian
Defense Ministry spokesman Col. Eduardo Arevalo.
   Arevalo said members of the cargo plane's crew were the only
U.S. military personnel who had arrived in Colombia.
   At his news conference following the drug summit, President Bush
said he knew nothing of any such radar station being built.
   Asked to describe how the military services of the United States
and Columbia were cooperating to interrupt the drug traffic, Bush
declined, giving as his reasons: ``Because I don't feel like it,
and because some of the things we do with Colombia, if I shared it
with you, maybe the drug narco-traffickers would find out about it,
and I don't want to do that.''

<HEAD>State Drops Case Against Minister Accused of Meeting with PLO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUIS MEIXLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Yosef Harish said Thursday he
was dropping an investigation into charges that a cabinet minister
violated Israel's anti-terrorism law by meeting with PLO officials.
   In January, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir accused Science
Minister Ezer Weizman of meeting with PLO officials and forced him
to quit the 12-member Cabinet. It is unclear if Weizman will be
readmitted to the Cabinet.
   Harish said he was ending his review of secret material gathered
in a police investigation of Weizman's meetings because there was
``no acceptable evidence'' that the minister knowingly met with PLO
officials.
   An ammendment to Israel's anti-terrorism law makes it illegal to
knowingly hold unauthorized contacts with members or
representatives of the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization.
   In the occupied territories Thursday, Palestinian activists beat
and stabbed to death a fellow Arab on suspicion of cooperation with
Israel, Arab reports said.
   They identified the man as Saadi Ismail el-Lidawi, 27, a taxi
driver from Rafah, a town in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   His death raised to 183 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs since the start of the 26-month-old uprising against
Israeli occupation. At least 656 Palestinians have been killed and
43 Israelis have died during the rebellion.
   In a five-page official statement released by Harish, the
attorney general stated that: ``There is no acceptable evidence ...
that Minister Weizman has committed any violations.''
   The statement also pointed out that Weizman has parliamentary
immunity from prosecution.
   The statement said an investigation led by Chief of Police David
Krauss revealed that Weizman had met the PLO's representative in
Geneva, Nabil Ramlawi, in June. The statement also said in November
Weizman held a telephone conversation with Ahmed Tibi, an Israeli
Arab, who was visiting Tunis.
   Shamir had accused Weizman of passing cabinet secrets to PLO
leaders in Tunis during a telephone conversation.
   Harish said Weizman had not violated the anti-terrorism law
because he met Ramlawi by accident and did not know of his role in
the PLO. He also said Weizman's telephone conversation with Tibi
could not be considered illegal because Tibi is an Israeli citizen
and not a member of the PLO.
   ``I feel justice has been done,'' Weizman told The Associated
Press. ``I am very satisfied.''
   Weizman, 65, a former defense minister who defected to Labor
from Shamir's Likud refused to comment when asked if he would
demand to return to the inner cabinet.

   Jurors in Joseph Hazelwood's trial
heard a tape recording Thursday of the skipper's harried voice
reporting the tanker Exxon Valdez had run aground and that he was
``trying to steer off the reef.''
   The recording was of conversations between Hazelwood and the
Coast Guard in the minutes after the nation's worst oil spill early
last March 24.
   ``Exxon Valdez, over,'' began the first transmission of
Hazelwood's voice. He said, ``We should be on your radar. We've
fetched up hard aground ... evidently we're leaking some oil and
we're going to be here for quite a while.''
   The Coast Guard responded, ``You're about a mile north of Bligh
Reef?,'' to which Hazelwood said, ``That's correct.'' He promised a
status report.
   Within minutes, the captain of the port, Coast Guard Cmdr.
Steven McCall, was on the radio asking for more information.
   ``We're working our way off the reef,'' Hazelwood said. ``Right
now we're trying to steer off the reef.''
   McCall then urged Hazelwood to ``take it slow and easy,''
promising that help was on the way. He warned against doing
``anything drastic to try to get under way'' and told Hazelwood,
``I wouldn't do much wiggling.''
   Prosecutors allege Hazelwood tried a potentially hazardous
maneuver after the grounding which could have capsized the crippled
ship.
   Other witnesses have said Hazelwood ordered the engines of the
ship restarted about 20 minutes after the grounding and gave
commands to move forward. Hazelwood's lawyers maintain he was
trying to stabilize the tanker on the reef, not take the dangerous
action of trying to move off the reef.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. If convicted, the former tanker skipper
could draw up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Earlier Thursday, the vessel's chief mate testified he had
warned Hazelwood that the seaman who had the helm before the
disaster ``needed practice in steering.''
   James Kunkel, corroborating earlier testimony by another officer
in Hazelwood's trial, said he'd sailed with seaman Robert Kagan
four years earlier and on that voyage Kagan could not perform a
simple task such as painting a bulkhead without constant
supervision.
   He said he discussed Kagan's performance with Hazelwood before
the Exxon Valdez began its trip into Prince William Sound.
   ``I mentioned I'd sailed with him before and I thought he needed
extra supervision and extra practice in steering,'' Kunkel said of
his conversation with Hazelwood. ``His steering ability needed to
be watched.''
   Kunkel said that after sailing with Kagan in June and July 1985,
he wrote an evaluation that said Kagan needed special attention and
``tended to drift off'' while steering.
   He noted that when assigned to paint a bulkhead, Kagan was
unable to proceed unless someone watched him to make sure he used
the right paint and the right brush.
   Kagan was at the wheel of the Exxon Valdez when the tanker ran
aground on jagged Bligh Reef, spewing more than 10 million gallons
of North Slope crude.
   Kagan, who was under the supervision of Third Mate Gregory
Cousins, testified he had been ``timid'' about steering since a
previous journey when he had been reprimanded for oversteering.
   Cousins testified that Kagan understeered the Valdez, failing to
turn hard enough to avoid the grounding.
   Cousins said he thought Kagan didn't understand the steering
orders.
   Previous witnesses have said Hazelwood was unaware of Kagan's
problems, but Kunkel contradicted that.
   Kunkel, who was in charge of loading the 987-foot tanker with
oil, gave the first detailed description of the ship's computerized
oil measuring devices and of security systems designed to prevent
spills.
   He recounted racing to the cargo room after the tanker hit the
reef and seeing the oil gauges dropping. The smell of oil was
everywhere, he said.
   Kunkel said he sat down at a computer, entered some calculations
and received a message that ``the ship was no longer meeting
required stability ... the ship should not go to sea.''
   In the first few hours, he said, the Exxon Valdez lost about
138,000 barrels, and by the time the final calculations were made,
it spilled 260,000 barrels _ or 10.92 million gallons.
   Kunkel said he notified Hazelwood of what was happening and
discussed preparations for possibly abandoning ship. He said the
captain chose not to sound a general alarm immediately because he
feared panic among the crew.
   The prosecution contends Hazelwood endangered the lives of crew
members by not awakening them immediately after the accident.
Ultimately, it was not necessary for the crew to abandon the Exxon
Valdez.

<HEAD>Study: Up to $30 Million Wasted Each Year on Useless Hospital
Diarrhea Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are needlessly paying $20 million to
$30 million a year for useless hospital tests to detect organisms
that cause diarrhea, a new study says.
   Many doctors automatically order bacterial or parasite tests on
patients who develop diarrhea while hospitalized, even though most
hospital-acquired diarrhea is caused by a toxin detected by a
different test, the study said.
   Doctors generally know this, but are hesitant to omit routine
tests in the absence of proof, said the study led by Dr. Don L.
Siegel of the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.
   Siegel and his team analyzed test patterns on stool specimens of
inpatients and outpatients with diarrhea at the hospital from
September 1985 through August 1988.
   They assumed that outpatients with diarrhea and inpatients who
had developed it within three days or less of hospitalization
brought the malady in with them, while other cases developed while
patients were in the hospital.
   The researchers looked at two tests _ bacterial cultures and
exams for parasites _ to detect the presence of organisms commonly
brought in from outside, such as Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter and others.
   Results for the three-year period showed that among 191 positive
stool cultures and 90 positive exams for eggs and parasites, only
one occurred in a person who developed diarrhea in the hospital,
the researchers said.
   The rest occurred in people who had brought the diarrhea in with
them, the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Yet half of the 3,000 specimens sent to the hospital laboratory
each year for the two tests came from patients who had been in the
hospital more than three days, the researchers said.
   ``Half the workload ... was for nothing,'' Siegel said in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   Overall, about 2.2 percent of the tests were positive.
   The researchers then compared those test patterns with ones for
a test to detect the toxin manufactured by a bacteria called
Clostridium difficile, which usually is responsible for
hospital-acquired diarrhea.
   They found that a quarter of those samples were positive for
Clostridium difficile toxin, regardless of when patients were
admitted.
   Clostridium difficile can be present in the digestive system
without causing trouble because it is kept in check by the other
bacteria that aid in digestion, Siegel said.
   When antibiotics or chemotherapy kill the other bacteria, the
Clostridium difficile multiply, causing diarrhea, he said.
   The researchers concluded that the toxin tests were appropriate,
but that the cultures and parasite tests could be eliminated for
patients who had been hospitalized for more than three days,
because they were useless.
   Even the one positive test among the cultures occurred in a
person who was in the hospital for a kidney transplant three weeks
after dining with her family at a restaurant where a Salmonella
outbreak had occurred. The outbreak sickened all of the patient's
relatives, indicating the patient brought the infection in with her.
   The hospital subsequently eliminated routine stool cultures and
parasite tests on patients who developed diarrhea after more than
three days of hospitalization, saving an estimated $25,000 a year,
the researchers said.
   A recent survey of 6,500 hospitals nationwide indicated 2
million stool cultures and 2 million stool parasite tests are
performed annually.
   At a cost of $20 and $10 each, respectively, if 30 percent to 50
percent were eliminated because they are unwarranted, resulting
savings would total $20 million to $30 million, the researchers
said.

   Soldiers wore camouflage uniforms and
had automatic rifles at their sides. Helicopter gunships made
passes over the city and its beaches while frigates patrolled the
bay _ all part of an extraordinary security blanket thrown over the
drug summit.
   Typifying the protective measures was a swarm of helicopters
that accompanied President Bush from Barranquilla, 60 miles
northeast of here, to the summit site at a heavily fortified naval
base.
   The helicopters rode fast and hugged the terrain in what was
described as an evasionary tactic against any attack. The
presidential chopper landed fast. It blew hats and helmets off
security guards spaced around the parade grounds as a U.S.
counter-assault team looked on _ its members wearing casual slacks,
polo shirts and huge backpacks.
   ``First class. We've got the best, the best,'' Bush said at one
point in boasting about the security detail.
   Asked at his news conference following the summit if he were
surprised that the meeting was not attacked, the president thanked
everybody concerned with security arrangements and said, ``I am not
surprised.''
   The U.S. security forces had taken extraordinary measures to
guard Bush following a report in December that Colombian drug lords
had taken a $30 million contract on the president's life and
reports that surface-to-air missiles had been acquired to shoot
down his plane.
   Two U.S. warships, the Nassau and the Sampson, were cruising off
the Colombian coast. The Nassau carries a Marine amphibious assault
company that can be used in the case of an emergency.
   Colombian navy frogmen checked the bay, apparently looking for
explosives near the Spanish fortification where the presidents were
meeting.
   The air corridor between the Caribbean coastal cities of
Barranquilla and Cartagena was closed to civilian aircraft. Two
American Blackhawk helicopters belonging to Colombia's army joined
in the security cover enveloping Cartagena Bay.
   There was no apparent sign of danger to Bush or to his summit
partners _ Presidents Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Alan Garcia of
Peru and Jaime Paz of Boliva.
   And yet, apparently protesting the Bush visit, young people
burned a Coca-Cola truck and a commuter microbus in the
northwestern city of Medellin, in front of the University of
Antioquia, the Colombian radio network Caracol said.
   In the central Colombian town of Barancabermeja, a toll booth on
the highway was blown up with dynamite and a wall near the booth
was painted with the message in Spanish, ``Gringos Get Out Of
Colombia!.''
   Also, near Barranquila Airport, a small bomb damaged a voltage
regulator on a power line that fed the air conditioning of the
airport where Bush landed two hours later.
   Later Thursday, an armed group kidnapped an American Roman
Catholic priest as he and some nuns were heading to a nearby church
to celebrate a mass, the RCN radio network reported.
   The Rev. Francis Amico was kidnapped as he and nuns of the
Mother Theresa order ``were leaving the Saint Andres (St. Andrewsw)
parish, in the eastern part of Cali,'' the network reported,
quoting a parish's priest.
   RCN report said no group or organization had immediately claimed
responsibility for the abduction. The priest works for a Canadian
religious order.
   In advance of the Thursday summit, security had been heightened
in Cartegena Bay near the finger of land where Bush and the others
held talks in a presidential guest house.
   A Colombian frigate had stationed itself just off the coast of
the peninsula and small patrol boats were speeding along the shores
with machine guns pointed inland.
   Across the bay from the peninsula, authorities had forced the
fishing boats that normally crowd Cartagena's docks to leave, and
except for some decrepit ships too damaged to move, the wharves
were empty.
   Naval authorities closed off Cartagena's bay to private boat
traffic and were guarding it with frogmen, frigates, high-speed
patrol boats and at least one submarine. Helicopters hovered above
high-rise luxury hotels, where guests were being required to submit
to fingerprinting.
   Cartagena's streets, normally packed with traffic and
pedestrians in the early morning hours, were practically abandoned.
   Scores of troops also surrounded the convention center where
much of the international press watched Barco's welcoming speech
broadcast on a giant screen television from the guest house across
the bay.
   Soldiers stood on the roof of the convention center as military
patrols roamed the sun-baked streets below.

<HEAD>Hawke Announces March 24 Election for Record 4th Labor Term</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf with details on economic situation</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke on Friday
called a general election for March 24 in a bid to gain a record
fourth consecutive term for his labor government.
   Hawke, 60, said the electorate ``faced clear and stark
alternatives'' in a vote for his government's record on managing
the economy.
   ``We can as a nation make the choice to continue on the path of
steady growth, or under the Conservatives we can choose to forsake
the future in a traumatic rerun of the late '70s and early '80s,''
he said.
   Hawke consistently rates as one of Australia's most popular
leaders ever, despite his tearful confessions on national
television about infidelity many years ago, his daughter's one-time
heroin addiction and his problems with alcohol.
   Recent opinion polls show support for the ruling Australian
Labor Party at 45 percent compared with the Conservative
Liberal-National Party coalition of 42 percent.
   Labor currently has 85 seats in 148-seat House of
Representatives, which chooses the government. The Liberal Party
has 45 seats and its coalition partner National Party has 18 seats.
   The coalition, now led by Andrew Peacock, was in power from 1975
to 1983.
   Hawke, in his announcement, also targeted the environment as an
issue, warning a return to a coalition government would lead to
environmental degradation.
   ``We, as a nation, simply cannot afford to go back to the
blinkered ideology of our Conservative opponents,'' he added.
   Hawke's announcement, at a news conference, left 36 days for
campaigning, three above the minimum required by parliamentary law.
   He said the country's 10 million voters could not have withstood
a longer campaign, adding, ``We would have collectively gone
bonkers.''
   Hawke said he expected to be victorious and lead the government
to an unprecedented fifth term before retiring. The Labor Party
under Hawke was first elected to government in March 1983, and was
re-elected in early polls in 1984 and 1987.
   An announcement of elections had been widely expected and the
deadline for calling the poll was May 12. Term of government is
three years.
   The timing of the election comes at a time of generally low
credibility for the government over the high 17 percent interest
rates that have hurt home buyers and small businesses.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on
Thursday said his country's relations with Japan will not improve
while Tokyo insists on the return of four Soviet-occupied islands
seized during World War II.
   ``If further pressed (on this issue) I don't think we can have a
productive relationship with Japan or any prospect of
advancement,'' the No. 2 man in the Kremlin told reporters before
departing for Sydney, his last stop on a three-day Australian visit.
   He described his talks with Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke
as ``very exciting.'' He concluded the Canberra visit with his
delegation signing six bilateral agreements, including a trade deal
and a pact providing for access for Soviet trawlers.
   The two countries also signed agreements on human rights,
peaceful uses of nuclear energy and protection of the environment.
   Ryzhkov said the fishing agreement did not go far enough. The
Soviet side suggested that in addition to port access, Soviet
fleets should be allowed unlimited access to Australia's huge fish
resources.
   In return, Ryzhkov said, the Soviet Union was willing to sell
part of the catch to Australia and trade it for Australian mutton
and lamb. He denied claims that Soviet boats could be used to spy
in the region.
   Ryzhkov arrived in Australia Tuesday from Bangkok and flies on
Friday to Singapore, host of the next Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation meeting. Japan is not on his itinerary.
   In December, Soviet and Japanese officials failed to reach an
accord to formally settle World War II because of the dispute over
the Kuril Islands, seized shortly before the war ended in 1945.
   The Soviets have called on Tokyo to renounce its claim to the
small islands north of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island.

   President Ali Saibou apologized Thursday
for the police killings of student demonstrators and said officers
will not interfere in a rally planned Friday to protest the
shootings.
   Brig. Gen. Saibou said no government minister gave the order for
police to open fire during last Friday's student demonstration, and
he promised to find out who allowed the police live ammunition.
   He called the shootings a ``police blunder.''
   The military government says three students were killed.
Students put the death toll at 12.
   Saibou was attending a drought conference in Cameroon at the
time and since has called emergency meetings of politicians and
administrators, to whom he addressed his remarks Thursday.
   Niger's trade unions called for a general public rally Friday to
insist on their constitutional right to protest peacefully.
   Saibou said the government will tolerate the demonstration on
condition it is peaceful.
   Students have been demanding better-equipped libraries and
laboratories, and guaranteed jobs in the government, which has
stopped hiring civil servants as part of an austerity program.
   The government has set up a commission to investigate their
grievances but says their demands are excessive in a country that
is among the world's poorest.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Communist chief Erich Honecker took
blame for the East German crisis and admitted that countrywide
local elections in May were manipulated, according to a statement
Thursday night on East German TV.
   Outrage over the municipal elections was a major factor in the
peaceful popular uprising headed by pro-democracy forces that led
to Honecker's ouster Oct. 18.
   The 77-year-old, ailing former leader has been accused of
widespread abuse of powers and fraud during his 18-year Stalinist
rule and faces trial next month for high treason and corruption.
   Rainer Eppelmann of Democratic Awakening, a prominent East
Berlin cleric and one of eight opposition officials added to
Communist Premier Hans Modrow's caretaker government on Feb. 5,
read the following Honecker declaration on TV:
   ``According to my earlier declarations, I admit being
politically responsible for the crisis in which the state and the
people of ... (East Germany) are suffering now. This extends to the
circumstances that led eventually to the manipulation of the
election results on May 7, 1989.
   ``At the same time, I want to stress that I never in my life
made political decisions out of egoistic motives and that I feel
free of any guilt in a juridical sense.''
   Honecker tried to hold out against the tide of reform that
coursed Eastern Europe last fall, but thousands upon thousands of
people from his frontline Soviet bloc state began escaping to the
West in August through Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   That set off rallies inside East Germany that finally forced
leadership changes. Huge protests marked the 40th anniversary of
Communist rule, and on Oct. 18, Honecker was replaced.
   The rallies continued, reaching 1 million on Nov. 4. On Nov. 9,
East Berlin opened its western border and dismantling of the Berlin
Wall began.
   Honecker and other former leaders were placed under house arrest
for investigation of corruption on Dec. 4.
   On Jan. 30, Honecker was freed from prison and put in a nursing
home on a court order.
   But hours later he was under arrest again and now awaits trial.
He currently resides in a Lutheran Church home.
   East Germany, meanwhile, is in a desperate economic crunch and
is seeking help from West Germany, as talk of German reunification
spreads through the world.

<HEAD>Biologist Nominated As MIT President, Asian-American to Lead
UC-Berkeley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A biologist was nominated to become president of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and an engineering scholar
became the first Asian-American selected as a University of
California chancellor, officials said Thursday.
   Phillip A. Sharp's nomination to become MIT's 15th president
will be voted on March 2 by the 96-member MIT Corporation, which
governs the school, school spokesman Bob D'Iorio said.
   At University of California-Berkeley, Chang-Lin Tien, a
54-year-old Chinese immigrant, will become head of the school July
1.
   Sharp was nominated by a faculty search committee, a faculty
advisory committee and the MIT Corporation's executive committee.
   Sharp, director of the university's center for cancer research,
would be the first biologist to head MIT, which is in Cambridge,
Mass. His 1977 discoveries on DNA are credited with dramatically
changing the field of molecular genetics.
   Paul E. Gray, MIT's president since 1980, said last year that he
would step down as of this summer.
   Sharp, 45, joined the MIT faculty in 1974 as an associate
professor of biology in the center for cancer research. He became
director of the center in 1985.
   MIT _ with about 10,000 graduate and undergraduate students,
nearly 1,000 faculty and about 8,000 staff members _ is famed for
its achievements in science and biology.
   Tien spent spent 29 years at the Berkeley campus before becoming
executive vice chancellor at UC-Irvine 18 months ago. He replaces
Ira Michael Heyman, who is retiring June 30 after 10 years.
   ``This appointment is an expression of commitment to the
Berkeley faculty and to the university's increasingly multicultural
population,'' Tien said in a statement.
   The Board of Regents affirmed UC President David P. Gardner's
recommendation at their regular meeting Thursday at UC's Laurel
Heights campus. The high-profile Berkeley campus, recognized not
only for its academic performances but also its history of student
political protest, has 38,000 students and 11,000 faculty and staff
employees. It is considered the most ethnically diverse major
university in the nation.
   Tien, the first Asian to head a campus in the 122-year-old state
university system, is an authority in heat transfer technology and
a member of the National Academy of Engineers, his field's most
prestigious professional association.
   While at Berkeley, he won the distinguished teaching award and
was honored for his scholarship in West Germany, Japan and China.
He came to the United States in 1955 after earning a bachelor's
degree at the National Taiwan University.

   Vassar College students, upset over a
remark allegedly made by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, ended their
35-hour occupation of a campus building Thursday after officials
agreed to hear their grievances.
   Jeff Rosenberg, a member of the Vassar Student Union which
helped organize the occupation, said about 100 protesters also left
the building because Moynihan has relinguished an honorary chair
and the $1,000 stipend it carries.
   The students began their occupation Wednesday to protest an
offensive remark allegedly made by Moynihan, D-N.Y., to a black
Jamaican woman he did not know was a Dutchess County official.
   Falomi Gray, head of the county youth bureau, claimed Moynihan
made a racial remark after she challenged him during a Jan. 29
lecture for his comment that the United States is ``a model of a
reasonably successful multi-ethnic society.''
   Gray said Moynihan told her that if she doesn't like it in the
United States, she should pack her bags and go back to where she
came from.
   Moynihan has said he does not remember making the remark.
   The students left Vassar's main administration building around
4:15 p.m., said college spokeswoman Dixie Sheridan.
   ``We are committed to negotiating the issues they presented,''
she said
   Earlier Thursday, the students said they would consider leaving
only when college President Frances Fergusson apologizes for
appointing Moynihan to the Eleanor Roosevelt Chair, an honorary
lecturing post.
   Other student demands included establishment of an
``intercultural center'' for minority meetings, a rabbi for Jewish
students and complete access for the disabled to all buildings.
   ``We will continue our discussions with them in order to ensure
that the issues raised are being fully addressed by the campus
community,'' Fergusson said in a statement.
   In Washington, meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole,
R-Kan., rallied to Moynihan's defense.
   ``Pat Moynihan a racist? You've got to be kidding!'' Dole said
in a statement. ``Pat has spent his life fighting for minorities,
the down and out and left out. ... This strange story coming out of
Poughkeepsie is absolutely preposterous.''

   The Social Democratic government of
Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson resigned after Parliament rejected
its economic austerity program on Thursday.
   The five opposition parties combined to defeat Carlsson's bill
190 to 153 came after a nationally televised six-hour debate. Six
members were absent.
   The measure, aimed at ending strikes and controlling inflation,
now at nearly 9 percent, would have frozen wages, prices, corporate
dividends, rents and local taxes for two years.
   The bill was drafted after a bitter strike closed all of
Sweden's banks earlier this year. Major cities also were threatened
with strikes that would close down bus and subway operations,
pre-schools and other municipal services.
   Right after the vote Thursday, Carlsson went to the office of
Speaker Thage G. Peterson to hand in the government's resignation.
   Carlsson stays on with a caretaker Cabinet.
   The Social Democrats have governed Sweden for 51 of the last 57
years, but their prospects were jolted later Thursday when Swedish
radio confirmed that Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt would not
stay on in any event.
   Carl Bildt, leader of the center-right Moderates, commenting
before the report was confirmed: ``If it's true, it means the end
of the government.''
   Reports circulated for days that Feldt, a politician held in
high esteem even by the non-socialist opposition, would leave.
   The Swedish news agency TT (Tidningarnas Telegrambyra) quoted an
unidentified government source as saying government lack of support
for Feldt's economic policies was the apparent reason he decided to
step down.
   Social Democratic deputies told TT, on conditiion of anonymity,
that Feldt's imminent resignation was more serious for the Social
Democratic movement than the government crisis itself.
   The speaker later met privately with opposition leaders to sound
them out about a new government. Another round of meetings is set
for Friday morning.
   The government's resignation plunged Sweden into political
confusion, with no party or alliance apparently able to form a
workable government without major compromises.
   Political analysts said the most likely outcome would be a
reconstituted Social Democratic government, with the tacit support
of the Communists. The Social Democrats control 156 seats and the
Communists 21 in the 349-member Riksdag.
   But that would require a major revision of the economic plan,
which Carlsson argued was necessary to put a lid on inflation
without jeopardizing the cornerstone policy of full employment.
   A possible alternative would be an alliance with the 20-member
Environment party, which took a tough bargaining position in
earlier negotiations. The Greens demanded heavy outlays for ecology
and public transport and the scrapping of a new jet fighter under
development.
   Bildt said the alliance of Social Democrats and Communists
effectively blocked a non-socialist alternative, unless new
elections were staged.
   ``Carlsson and his policy have failed and he has resigned. At
the same time he's afraid to face the voters,'' Bildt said.
   Opinion polls published before the political uproar began gave
the Social Democrats their worst showing in more than 45 years,
with a 34 percent approval rating.
   But the three centrist parties, which governed in coalition from
1976 to 1982, also would not gain a majority in a new election, the
polls predicted.
   If no one succeeds in organizing a new government, an election
will be called 35 to 90 days after efforts break down. The next
scheduled election is September 1991.
   In the debate, Carlsson told Parliament his program was aimed to
defend full employment, which he called the ``basis of a fair
society.'' He said the opposition criticized the wage-prize freeze
without offering an alternative.
   He said Swedish products would soon be priced out of world
markets _ a disaster for a nation of 8.5 million people relying
heavily on exports.
   Independent economists blame the unemployment rate of about 1
percent for driving up prices and encouraging labor unrest.

<TEXT>
   The army has ordered tens of thousands of
people to abandon their homes in western forests and mountains that
have been infiltrated by rebels, it was reported Thursday.
   New Vision newspaper said at least 80,000 people, mainly
peasants, began leaving the slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains Jan.
15 after an estimated 500 guerrillas crossed the western border
with Zaire.
   Smarts Kiggundu, the army commander in the region, 250 miles
west of the capital Kampala, said the evacuation was necessary to
ease the search for the rebels, New Vision reported.
   The Rwenzururu Movement, were led by Amon Bazira, a former
member of ousted President Milton Obote's Cabinet is fighting the
current government of President Yoweri Museveni.
   Crispus Kiyonga, finance minister and parliamentary
representative in the region, has suggested housing the refugees on
an airfield, according to the newspaper.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the peasants are currently housed in school buildings, community
halls, and unused public buildings.
   The Rwenzururu Movement, an obscure group formed in the 1950s,
demanded a separate state when the British ruled the East African
nation. The group continued agitating for a separate state even
after Uganda's independence from Britain in 1962 but was considered
by Ugandan authorities a mere nuisance.
   Museveni, who fought a five-year bush war against Obote, seized
power in February 1986 after chasing from office the generals who
had ousted Obote six months earlier.

   You'd never confuse Miss Margarida with Mr.

created by the Hollywood dream machine.
   Or even with Miss Grundy, the crotchety nemesis of Archie,
Veronica, Jughead and all the rest of those perpetually teen-age
students found only in the funny papers or comic books.
   Miss Margarida has more ferocious predecessors. Try Attila the
Hun. Or Nero _ with a dash of Hitler, Stalin and just about any
tinhorn South American dictator of the last 50 years. Miss
Margarida could hold her own.
   She is the centerpiece of ``Miss Margarida's Way,'' Roberto

Parsons. The years haven't diminished Parsons' awesome performance.
She's a hurricane, an actress riding a whirlwind of a part and not
once falling off.
   The evening begins with a shattering school bell, as Miss
Margarida strides to the stage _ a simple setting of desk and
blackboards _ from the back of the theater.
   ``There's no good teacher without a good class,'' she intones
unctuously. ``You must cultivate obedience.'' Obedience is what
Miss Margarida is after in the course of Athayde's play. She'll get
it any way she can. The woman will flirt, coo and carry on if
that's what it takes. Learning is only incidental.
   A lesson in biology becomes a lesson in seduction as Miss
Margarida fluffs her hair, applies makeup with a shovel and sashays
around the stage. But when things don't go her way, she turns ugly.
   ``Miss Margarida's Way'' works on two levels. Athayde's play has
obvious political connotations. The teacher can be seen as a
metaphor for any repressive authority. The playwright, who is
Brazilian, counted on that when his work was done in his own
country in the early '70s. But it can also be seen as an absurdist
comedy, an exercise in black humor about a teacher who gives
lessons in the futility of life.
   ``Nobody asked your opinion about getting in and now you can't
get out,'' Miss Margarida says to her class about what to expect
from school and life.
   The script allows for a certain amount of give-and-take between
actress and audience. And Parsons brilliantly takes anything
theatergoers give and then throws it back at them. Not all of the
shenanigans are spontaneous. There is also an actor planted in the
audience, but his contribution is minimal in all the ruckus Parsons
stirs up.
   The play gets a little messy and repetitive at times. The
harangues turn shrill occasionally, but the star can pull out of a
downward screech before it stops the show cold.
   A few words of warning. Don't show up late for school. If you
do, you might find yourself on stage, sitting in a corner and
wearing a dunce cap. And don't sass the teacher. Miss Margarida
takes no prisoners.

   Acting on an invitation from President Bush,
travel-weary Secretary of State James A. Baker III also slept
aboard Air Force One in a hangar at Andrews Air Force Base before
flying Thursday to Colombia for a drug conference.
   He slept on a sofa, made into a bed, in a compartment used
usually by first lady Barbara Bush that is partitioned from Bush's
bedroom aboard the jetliner.
   Bush telephoned Baker with the offer Wednesday morning, and he
accepted. He had returned Monday night from a nine-day trip to
Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania and Canada that
covered 15,490 miles.
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said Baker
worked in his office until 6 p.m. Wednesday and then went home for
dinner.
   Baker then went to the White House, where he joined Bush in the
brief helicopter flight to the air base in Maryland where he
boarded Air Force One in its hangar.
   Baker slept under light blue blankets that bear a black U.S. Air
Force insignia.
   In 1979, former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance similarly
slept aboard an Air Force jet in a hangar at Andrews before a
pre-dawn departure on a trip to Ecuador.

   Lech Walesa said Thursday Poland must be
present at German unification talks where Polish borders are
discussed, and President Wojciech Jaruzelski called it a ``question
of life or death'' for Polish citizens.
   ``It is one-third of our territory, one-third of the population
and 85 percent of our access to the sea,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``For Germany, the (former German) territories that now belong
to Poland ... are rather a question of history and sentiment, and
sometimes a card in a electoral game,'' he told the German ARD
television network in an interview, excerpts of which were also
broadcast on Polish television.
   He said he recognizes Germany's right to self-determination, but
a parallel right should exist for Poland, ``which has had heavy
historic experiences and for which guarantees of stable borders are
a question of life or death.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki insists that Poland be at
talks on reunification planned by East Germany, West Germany and
the four occupying powers of World War II: the United States,
Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   Mazowiecki said Wednesday that Poland could not tolerate such
talks being held without being there itself to make sure that a
reunified Germany would respect Poland's western border _ which
some Germans have challenged.
   Right-wing German politicians have never abandoned claims to
40,000 square miles of territory Poland was awarded from Germany at
the end of World War II _ compensation for an even larger area
taken from Poland by the Soviet Union.
   After meeting privately with Mazowiecki and discussing the
German question, Solidarity leader Walesa endorsed his demand about
Poland's attending talks.
   ``I think one cannot discuss Polish borders without Poland's
presence,'' Walesa told reporters.
   He differed with Mazowiecki, however, in demanding on Thursday
that the Red Army withdraw from Poland this year.
   Mazowiecki's Solidarity-led government has adopted a more
tolerant attitude, saying the 40,000 Soviet troops in Poland should
leave only after creation of a new security arrangement for Europe.
   Defense Minister Gen. Florian Siwicki cited ``stormy processes''
going on in Germany in issuing a statement Thursday which said
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland must be approached ``very
carefully.''
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich-Genscher rejected on
Thursday Poland's request to be included in the talks, but he
repeated that no Polish territories would be included in the
reunited Germany.
   Such assurances have been unconvincing for many Poles, whose
homeland was the victim of a united Germany in two world wars.
   ``Nothing about us, without us,'' government spokesman Henryk
Wozniakowski said Wednesday, quoting a Polish proverb to push the
point that Poland should be at the German reunification talks.
   President Francois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl agreed on Thursday at a meeting in Paris that a European
summit on German reunification would be desirable, probably in
April after March 18 elections in East Germany.
   ``The German question can only be solved under a European
roof,'' said Kohl, ruling out a neutral Germany as envisioned by
East Germany's Communist leader, Hans Modrow.
   Kohl rebuffed a statement by Mitterrand that the Oder-Neisse
line should immediately be recognized as a united Germany's eastern
border with Poland.
   ``When we have a common government and Parliament, this
government and Parliament will have to give the answer,'' he said.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Calls Perestroika a Peaceful Revolution that Will
Succeed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet foreign minister, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, told Canadian lawmakers Thursday that the
restructuring of Soviet economy and politics was a ``peaceful
revolution'' that will succeed despite its foes.
   In a 40-minute, nationally televised address to a joint session
of Parliament's defense and foreign affairs committees,
Shevardnadze said of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms:
   ``It is a vexed process, a highly troublesome process. There are
people who would prefer to see a different path of development and
there are radicals on both sides.
   ``But it is, on the whole, a peaceful revolution. It's the
development of a new society, a new sense of civic
responsibility,'' he said. ``We believe in the success of
perestroika.''
   Legislation is being drafted for a total reform of economic
relations which will include the right to private property,
Shevardnadze said.
   ``We are excluding the exploitation of man by man. Everything
else is permitted,'' the foreign minister said.
   He conceded that the Soviet Union is ``indeed sick'' with ethnic
strife and economic problems, but said it is beginning to recover
and ethnic clashes will be brought under control.
   ``We continue to think that in the very near future we will be
successful in stabilizing the country. We understand that this is
not just a concern for the Soviet people but also for the whole
world. We recognize our responsibility to our own people and to the
world,'' the Soviet minister said.
   Speaking in Russian through an interpreter, he admitted that
past Soviet leaders sometimes hoped to ``squeeze the United States
out of the European arena,'' but said the Kremlin now wants Canada
and the United States ``highly involved'' in drafting new security,
disarmament and economic arrangements for Europe.
   Shevardnadze indicated that Moscow wants the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe to plan a new, peaceful order in
Europe and believes it can serve as guarantor of Soviet security
interests.
   The conference, which produced the Helsinki Accords on human
rights, has as members all European countries except Albania, plus
Canada and the United States.
   He said the conference must hold serious discussions on new
military doctrines for Europe that would be based on defense, not
offense.
   Shevardnadze challenged Washington to be more flexible with arms
control on the high seas and in space.
   The minister said the Soviet Union welcomes the dramatic changes
sweeping other East bloc countries, and that imposed ``distorted
socialism'' there could not have continued indefinitely.
   He made clear it was up to the people of the two Germanys to
decide their future, but suggested that Europe, the United States
and Canada might hold a referendum on German unification so German
leaders could see how others view the issue.
   Shevardnadze was in Ottawa for the Open Skies conference _
negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact to allow unarmed
surveillance flights over each other's territory.
   He stayed for a two-day official visit, returning to Moscow
after his appearance at the parliamentary committees.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and three Latin
American leaders, conducting a tense summit under an air, sea and
land security shield, forged agreement Thursday on a new joint
drug-fighting strategy. Bush called it ``the first anti-drug
cartel.''
   Flanked by the leaders of the three largest cocaine-producing
nations, Bush called the summit an ``ice-breaking'' event. He vowed
to step up attempts to curtail the demand for narcotics at home,
saying ``we are making progress'' but that more needs to be done.
   A joint communique signed by Bush and Presidents Virgilio Barco
of Colombia, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peru
apparently ruled out the use of U.S. military forces in the Andean
region. ``Each country may involve its armed forces in this fight
within its own national territory,'' it said.
   In their meeting, they steered away from some of the most
controversial drug initiatives, such as the idea of a naval cordon
off Colombia, and chose instead to deal in broader themes. That
helped keep harmony among sometimes differing leaders.
   Extraordinary security precautions were taken to protect Bush
and his three summit partners, with some 5,000 uniformed troops
watching over the proceedings. Battleships presented an imposing
force off shore and helicopter gunships hovered nearby.
   But Colombian guerrillas made their own point, one of defiance.
They kidnapped an American priest in Cali, the third U.S. citizen
taken prisoner by rebels this week. Also, a small bomb exploded
Thursday morning, 4{ miles from Barranquilla Airport, damaging a
voltage regulator of a line that fed the air conditioning of the
airport where Bush landed two hours later.
   Summing up his talks with the Latin American presidents, Bush
told reporters, ``I owe it to the children of America, the United
States, ... to these three presidents, to guarantee them that we
will do everything we can to cut ... the demand for narcotics in
the United States.''
   That was a message that had been awaited by the three Andean
president, who came to the summit complaining that the United
States had not done enough at home to curtail demand for drugs.
   Back in Washington, D.C., the U.S. capital, federal prosecutors
sent a separate message _ announcing the indictment of Mayor Marion
Barry on eight counts of perjury and possession of a controlled
substance.
   ``Every tactic and every weapon pales into insignificance
compared to the need to reduce demand,'' Barco said. ``The only law
that the narco-terrorists do not break is the law of supply and
demand.''
   Zamora, with a nod to the sweeping reforms that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev had introduced to his part of the world, said a
new openness had been attained here. ``A perestroika has begun,''
he told reporters at a wind-up news conference.
   Zamora said the leaders had talked about creating an ``alternate
economy'' so the peasants of the coca-growing and processing
nations would not be dependent on the crop for their livelihoods.
   After the meetings, he said, ``We understand the true magnitude
of the problem and how to face it.''
   Bush returned to Washington on Air Force One without incident.
   William Bennett, director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy, told reporters on the return flight that the session was a
success in that it developed a clearcut consensus between the
United States and the three Andean drug-producing nations on
developing a common drug-fighting strategy.
   ``This could be the day these things came to maturity,'' he said.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aaronson said, ``This is a
real sea-change in the international debate about drugs.''
   At the end, Garcia, who once threatened to boycott the summit to
protest the U.S. invasion of Panama, spoke of the need for a
vigorous crop substitution program, and with a smile, asked,
``Where's the beef?''
   Said Garcia: ``What has changed here is concepts, so that we
never go back _ a better relationship between Latin America and the
United States.''
   Barco said, ``No,'' when asked if Colombia would be willing to
have U.S. naval forces patrolling in international waters off
Colombia's coast to keep track of drug shipments. ``It is not
necessary,'' he said.
   Responding to Colombian complaints that U.S. trade policy has
harmed its major legal exports such as coffee, cut flowers and
sugar, Bush promised to work to help open more U.S. markets.
   In their communique, the summit nations called for a ``world
conference against illicit drug trafficking in 1991.'' The four
nations agreed to hold a high-level followup to Thursday's session
within six months, but specified no level of U.S. aid to help the
South Americans.
   Bush previously had pledged $2.2 billion over five years to aid
the Andean countries economically and militarily in waging the drug
war. He said Thursday he did not foresee any immediate increases in
that commitment.
   But he did say the four had taken significant steps to work
together on the problem. ``We in fact created the first anti-drug
cartel.''
   The statement recognized that persuading Andean farmers to
substitute legal crops for coca, the leaves of which are used to
make cocaine, would have ``significant, immediate and long-term
economic costs'' on the three South American countries.
   Responding to Colombian complaints that U.S. trade policy has
harmed its major legal exports such as coffee, cut flowers and
sugar, Bush promised to work to help open more U.S. markets.
   U.S. officials also reached agreement with Bolivia to help stem
the movement of U.S. firearms into South American nations and
signed tax accords with both Bolivia and Peru aimed at establishing
a system to trace drug profits and money-laundering schemes.
   Gunboats patrolled Cartagena Bay. The sparkling blue waterway
was closed to harbor traffic. Frogmen checked the bay. Helicopters
buzzed overhead. Some 5,000 security guards roamed the nearly empty
streets. A squadron of fighter bombers and a fleet of warships
stood by. Dogs sniffed for bombs.
   The bomb at Barranquilla airport exploded at a high-tension
electricity tower in the village of Soledad, the manager of the
electric comany for the state of Atlantico, Eduardo Berano de La
Rosa told the Associated Press.
   He said he could not estimate how big the bomb was but from the
little damage that it caused, it could not have been very powerful.
No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, he said.
   The president was ready to offer summit partners the use of Navy
ships to cast a radar screen over Colombia to detect drug-carrying
aircraft.
   But that idea aroused Latin American sensitivies last month when
it was portrayed as a blockade. As a result, U.S. officials said
Bush would not even mention the ship idea unless it was raised by
someone else.
   U.S. officials warned in advance that Bush was not bringing more
money beyond the aid package already presented, calling for $423
million for fiscal 1991 in military, law enforcement and economic
assistance for the three countries.
   Bush's trip here was regarded largely as a gesture of solidarity
with Barco, who has waged an unrelenting, six-month war against the
drug lords.
   Colombian forces have seized tons of cocaine and hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of property. They killed Gonzalo
Rodrigues Gacha, a leader of the infamous Medellin cartel.
   It has not been a war without casualties.
   There have been 262 terrorist acts blamed on drug bosses since
the government crackdown began Aug. 18. The attacks, mostly
bombings, have claimed 209 lives.

   Vietnamese forces may be operating again in
Cambodia just five months after Hanoi reported all of its troops
had been withdrawn for good, according to reports reaching top U.S.
officials.
   The officials said Wednesday the reports indicate renewed
Vietnamese involvement in the conflict was the result of
battlefield setbacks suffered by the Hanoi-backed government in
Cambodia.
   Representatives of the United States and the four other
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council compared
notes on the issue on Monday and Tuesday in New York where they
discussed ways to advance the Cambodian peace process.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and installed a friendly
government after ousting the Khmer Rouge regime, which has been
held responsible for the deaths of more than 1 million Cambodians
during almost four years in power.

   A limited choice of contraceptives in the
United States is leading to increases in abortions and voluntary
sterilizations, according to a report by the National Research
Council.
   Called ``Developing New Contraceptives,'' the study released
Wednesday said Americans have fewer contraceptive choices than in
other countries due to government policies that discourage research
and product development.
   The contraceptive methods now available in the United States,
the report said, ``leave major gaps in the ability of people to
control fertility safely, effectively and in culturally acceptable
ways.''
   Contraceptives are used at some point in the lives of 95 percent
of the 54 million sexually active American women between ages 15
and 44, the report said. It said about 20 percent of this number
have been voluntarily sterilized.

   Perrier has ordered distributors worldwide to dump
160 million bottles of its bubbly water because a toxic chemical
contaminated some shipments. Officials say the move will disrupt
distribution for three months.
   In yanking shipments from distribution in 120 countries, Perrier
President Gustave Leven said officials ``don't want the least
doubt, as minimal as it might be, to weigh on the image of the
quality and purity of our product.'' Officials estimated the recall
will cost the company $35 million.
   Earlier this week, about 72 million bottles of Perrier were
withdrawn from the U.S. market after benzene was detected in tests
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The recall was extended
to Canada, and a Japanese subsidiary said it would withdraw Perrier
from stores.
   Traces were also found earlier this week in samples from Denmark
and the Netherlands, prompting a recall there. Perrier's
distributor in Australia today ordered the recall of 40,000 cases.

   Sheep now feed off grass and overgrown
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to
seal off Albania. Today, the fight against the world's ``corrupting
effects'' takes a different form.
   Western culture, although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and
intellectuals, seeps through the increasingly porous borders of
Europe's most isolated nation.
   Western ideas contrast sharply with Albanian orthodoxy but there
is little open evidence of any grass-roots disaffection threatening
to topple the last European refuge of Stalinism.
   Reports of anti-communist riots in the northern city of Skhoder
in January apparently were unfounded. Officials here charge they
were fabricated by the state-controlled media in Yugoslavia, which
is at odds with Albania over the fate of millions of ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
   ``We do not want to assimilate; we want to preserve our national
identity,'' said Ymer Minxhozi, general secretary of the Albanian
Union of Journalists.
   ``We have no homosexuality, no prostitution, no drugs and no
black market,'' he told a group of visiting Western journalists.
   The bunkers, first built during World War II to guard against a
land invasion, were vastly expanded after the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact marched into Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now they are falling into
disuse.
   No one knows exactly how many bunkers there are, but one
official estimated at least one for every Albanian _ 3 million.
   ``The bunkers in Albania do not move ... they have no feet or
wheels. They do not threaten anyone,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Socrat Placa said in an interview.
   During its 45-year history as a Stalinist state, Albania has had
little to do with the world beyond its borders. It still reveres
the memory of Josef Stalin and adheres strictly to Marxist-Leninist
doctrine.
   Albania cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1961 because of its
de-Stalinization program and with China in 1978 because of China's
perceived deviation from Marxist-Leninist policies after Mao
Tse-tung's death.
   Enver Hoxha, the founder of the communist state in Albania, died
in 1985, but his policies and personality cult survive. A Hoxha
museum opened last year, a marble and glass temple among Tirana's
dilapidated and windowless buildings.
   Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, is credited with introducing some
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the Albanian
system. Mistrust and hostility toward Moscow and Washington remain,
however.
   Placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard
a Western news report on a visiting reporter's radio of an
explosion at a Soviet military base in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Good, good, very good. ... Of course it may have some
consequences but is a good lesson for Gorbachev,'' Placa said.
   Nevertheless, Placa said, discussions were under way to further
increase ties with ``both East and West.''
   Albanians are able to view Italian, Yugoslavian and Greek
television. Scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in Tirana
were the words, ``IRON MAIDEN,'' a leading British heavy-rock band.
   In another part of town, someone had repeatedly written ``liri''
(freedom) on a kiosk wall, an uncommon slogan in a country with a
powerful secret police, the Sigurimi.
   Activities of the Sigurimi were assailed last year, however, in
a best-selling novel by writer Neshat Tozaj, who works as a
criminal investigator in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   The novel, ``Thikat'' (Knives), portrayed the Sigurimi as
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions.
   Publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could
indicate a relaxation of censorship or, as some Western observers
suggested, a power struggle to restrict the Sigurimi.
   ``The artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it
touched on certain themes in our society. ... Life must be
reflected in literature,'' said Nasi Lera, secretary of the
Albanian Union of Artists and Writers.
   Authorities still want to stop controversial material about
Albania from reaching abroad.
   Visiting Finnish television journalists found on their return
home evidence of tampering with an interview with Foreign Minister
Reiz Malile, which had been filmed by a local crew.
   Malile had acknowledged on camera that Albania had some
political prisoners but added, ``It's not a problem.'' That section
of tape was replaced by a segment of an Albanian song contest.
   Modern Western literature is translated into Albanian, and
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote
are better known than Spanish, Italian or French writers, said
Ismail Kadare, Albania's best-known modern author.
   ``We don't approve of pornography ... and our greatest problem
is mediocrity. But that's a worldwide problem,'' Kadare added in an
interview.
   ``The West definitely has a corrupting influence ... even though
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements
and progress,'' a 21-year-old woman said.
   She added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange
program, then said, ``But things are so good here.''

<HEAD>Soviet Jews in Israel Having to Prove They're Jewish</HEAD>

   Asya Gomelsky says she survived two pogroms in
her 83 years but never expected her Jewishness to be called into
question in Israel.
   That is what happened when Mrs. Gomelsky's 50-year-old son Boris
asked the Interior Ministry for identity papers for his family now
that it has arrived from the Soviet Union.
   The Gomelskys were turned down on grounds that they had no
documents proving they were Jewish _ birth certificates, for
example.
   Those who are rejected can get rent subsidies and other benefits
as immigrants, but their ID cards do not say ``Jewish.'' Without
that word, the they may have trouble with marriage, divorce or
other personal matters controlled by Israel's ultra-Orthodox
establishment.
   The Gomelskys' story and similar tales surfacing with the new
rush of Soviet immigrants have sparked protests by Soviet activists
and complaints by four Israeli liberal parties over policies of the
Interior Ministry, which is controlled by the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party.
   ``Do you know what it is to question the Jewishness of those who
have suffered for generations in the Soviet Union for being
Jewish,'' Robert Golan, head of a Soviet activist group, told the
Jerusalem Post.
   Mrs. Gomelsky, who appeared on Israel Television after the
rejection, touched many Israelis with the tale of her sufferings
during Russia's 1917 Revolution and civil war.
   ``I survived two pogroms and was persecuted as a Jew, and here
in Israel they tell me I'm not Jewish,'' Mrs. Gomelsky wept. ``In
1919 ... they wanted to rape my elder sister and when my father
tried to protect her they cut him with sabers, and we ran away to
hide in the fields.''
   After the broadcast, several ministers questioned Interior
Minister Arye Deri, a member of Shas, in a Cabinet meeting. Soviet
activists warned the following day they would take to the streets
over Deri's policies.
   But on a visit to Interior Ministry offices here a reporter
found several recent Soviet arrivals who came for identity cards
still were being turned away under the same policy.
   ``Go home and come back when you have papers showing you are
Jews,'' an official told them.
   While law requires documentation, some Israelis maintain that in
the case of Soviet immigrants it is better to risk the few who
might be frauds than to humiliate the many who are not.
   For years, the Interior Ministry also has been ruled by the
ultra-Orthodox, for whom the mostly secular wave of Soviet Jews can
mean change.
   The expected arrival of up to 300,000 Soviet Jews in the next
three years could undermine Israel's delicate balance of internal
political power in which three ultra-Orthodox parties and a
religious one usually hold the key to forming coalition governments.
   Neither of the country's two major parties, the right-wing Likud
bloc or center-left Labor Party, has ever won enough seats in the
120-member Knesset, the Israeli parliament, to govern on their own.
That means each scrambles to bring the religious parties into
coalitions.
   Over the years, Israel's religious community used this power to
pass laws favoring the Orthodox and enforce rules forcing
businesses and entertainment spots to close from sundown Friday
till sundown Saturday, the Sabbath.
   The ultra-Orthodox fear this may change with the Soviet Jewish
immigration wave, which they claim includes many couples of mixed
marriages and even non-Jews.
   In mid-January, the ultra-Orthodox weekly publication Yom
Hashishi claimed that Israeli officials in Moscow ``reject
immigration requests of elderly religious Jews, preferring young
intellectual couples in spite of a large percentage of mixed
marriages among them.''
   ``This selection will change in the coming years the face of the
Israeli society.''
   Religious Affairs Minister Zevulun Hammer fueled the controversy
by saying up to 30 percent of the Soviet immigrants were non-Jews
trying to find a way to get out of the Soviet Union.
   Israel's Law of Return grants automatic citizenship to Jews _
including descendants of Jewish men _ and their spouses, even if
they are non-Jewish.
   The Orthodox establishment recognizes as Jews only descendants
of a Jewish mother or persons who underwent an Orthodox conversion.
It wants the law changed to include this definition.
   To back up their case, Religious Affairs Ministry officials
announced they found 30 non-Jews who allegedly used false papers to
come to Israel last year, when some 12,000 Soviet Jews immigrated.
   ``Each day, there're infiltrations of non-Jewish immigrants,''
complained Yigal Bibi of Hammer's National Religious Party.
   In protesting the Interior Ministry policy on birth
certificates, Yair Tzaban of the leftist Mapam Party said it was
better ``to risk accepting a small number of non-Jews ...
disguising themselves as Jews, rather than humiliate thousands of
others.''

   About a dozen Roman Catholic parishes in
downtown Milwaukee pooled resources to form a centralized school
system with four campuses. Also, on the city's south side, plans
are mapped to link 42 parochial schools into a regional system,
with a joint board, budget and shared facilities and staff.
   The aim is both to combine resources to strengthen the schools
and effect economies through interparish distribution of costs,
said the the Rev. Ralph C. Gross, chancellor of the Milwaukee
Archdiocese.
   ``We're trying to take some of the school pressure off
individual parishes so they can be more fruitful, worshiping
communities,'' he added.
   Such changes in many cities signal a gradual but far-reaching
transformation in the church's patterns for educating the young.
   Under strains of financing and personnel, the single-parish
parochial school is fading before the larger cooperative
enterprises, but with special efforts to preserve an intimate
atmosphere and close ties with parents.
   ``All sorts of new patterns are emerging,'' said Sister
Catherine T. McNamee, president of the National Catholic
Educational Association in Washington
   She said the ``restructuring of schools,'' including
consolidations, mergers for different grade levels and other
collaborative configurations have come as populations shifted among
city areas and to suburbs.
   However, the combinations seek to maintain a basis in
geographical proximity, she said, such as urban ethnic parishes a
few blocks apart, of French, Polish and Italian origins for
example, forming a joint school.
   ``Now they've combined for the whole neighborhood,'' she said.
   Various difficulties have cut Catholicism's elementary and
secondary schools in half over the last quarter century, reducing
5.6 million students in 12,300 schools in 1965 to 2.6 million
students in 8,800 schools now.
   But despite continuing problems, including added expenses of lay
teachers that pervasively have replaced the once low-cost but now
scarce teaching sisters, the school shrinkage seems abated.
   ``It's pretty much stablized,'' Sister McNamee said, noting that
some enrollments are edging back up, expanding rapidly in the lower
grades. ``We're holding up fairly well now.''
   Similar comments came from several dioceses, where checks found
many of them consolidating former single-parish schools. Past
decline ``is tapering off,'' said the Rev. George Norton of the
Rochester, N.Y., diocese.
   Realignments connecting some schools or prospects of it were
reported in St. Louis; Baltimore; Green Bay, Wis., Newark, N.J.,
Cleveland and Brooklyn, among others.
   In Erie, Pa., the dioscesan chancellor, Monsignor Robert Smith
said a newly established advisory board was weighing various
linkages of schools and parishes. ``It's the challenge of the times
for being viable,'' he said.
   The church's huge outlay for schools for the nation's young
parallels the efforts of public schools but with one glaring
difference _ no help from community taxes.
   Sister McNamee pointed out that families of children going to
Catholic schools pay full taxes for public schools ``but get no
benefit from it'' or any relief in maintaining the alternative
system.
   She said it would cost public schools an estimated additional
$10 billion annually to take on the load of enrollments in Catholic
schools, but Catholics alone have to bear it, while also paying
public school taxes.
   Not only that, she said but 12.3 percent nationally of
youngsters in Catholic schools are non-Catholics. The proportion is
much higher in inner- city Catholic schools, whose enrollments run
from 60 percent to 80 percent non-Catholic.
   The Rev. Philip J. Murnion, director of the National Pastoral
Life Center, said Catholic financing of a ``major alternative''
school system for whites, blacks, Chinese or whatever without
public help is a ``whole new mission.''
   ``It's a remarkable process funded by the Catholic conscience,''
he said, noting that it also undergirds freedom of choice in
education.
   Studies indicate that academic effectiveness of Catholic schools
surpasses that of public schools.
   What has greatly increased the costs of church schools is the
steep, prolonged decline in sisters who in the 1940's provided 92
percent of the teachers, with only 8 percent lay people. Now it's
about reversed.
   Eighty-five percent now are lay people, their pay necessarily
considerably higher but still ``very modest and way back of public
schoolteachers,'' Sister McNamee said. ``It's nowhere near where it
should be.''
   The turnabout from religious sisters to lay teachers came as the
total number of nuns in the country fell from a peak of 181,400 in
1965 to only 104,400 now, a decline of 76,000.

   Joseph Doherty, who has fought British rule in
Northern Ireland with rocks, rifles and machine guns, has a new
weapon of choice clipped to the breast pocket of his orange prison
overalls.
   ``I've come to believe that the pen is mightier than the
sword,'' he said in an interview at the federal jail where he's
spent 6{ years.
   ``That's my message when I do an interview or answer a letter. I
don't say, `Up the IRA!' or `Send more arms.' I don't mention the
IRA. I stress what you can do politically to change things.''
   Doherty, who pronounces his name DOCK-erty, has ample time to
reflect on the advantages of the ballot box to the bomb. He has
been at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan longer
than any inmate in its history, longer even than most of its
guards. He has done his time under three wardens and four captains.
   Doherty's path to the MCC began a decade ago with a gunfight in
Belfast between his IRA unit and British troops. Doherty was
captured and convicted of murdering a British officer. Facing two
life terms, he escaped from jail and fled to New York City, where
he was arrested by the FBI in 1983.
   The British demanded his extradition, but a federal judge
accepted Doherty's argument that the killing was not a common crime
but a political act, part of the IRA's campaign to drive the
British from Northern Ireland's six counties and reunite the
province with the Irish Republic. Doherty could not be extradited.
   Doherty's case has since bounced from court to court; the
British have not been able to get him back, but he has not been
able to go free, despite more than a half-dozen court rulings in
his favor. His case has become a metaphor for his homeland's
intractable troubles.
   To Irish nationalists and human rights activists, Doherty is ``a
symbol of the battle against tyranny,'' according to Paul O'Dwyer,
former New York City Council president and an activist for the
Irish cause. Doherty's prison visitors have included Cardinal John
J. O'Connor, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and 10 congressmen. In his
victory speech, Mayor David Dinkins demanded ``Justice for Joe
Doherty!''
   More than 100 members of Congress have signed resolutions
supporting his requests for bail and asylum, and similar measures
have passed several dozen state, county and local legislatures.
   But Doherty's musings about the limits of armed rebellion have
upset some Irish nationalists.
   Late last year the New York Daily News quoted him as saying that
the IRA's armed rebellion ``can't go on,'' that its ``strategy
hasn't worked,'' and that it should consider a unilateral
cease-fire.
   ``I see another soldier shot dead by the IRA and I think, I read
this five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago,'' he said. ``If we
carry this war on another 20 years, it'll be such a waste of life.''
   In an interview two days after his 35th birthday last month,
Doherty smiled ruefully and shifted in his chair when he was asked
about the reaction to his relatively dovish comments.
   ``A lot of people have said to me, `You're in prison, Joe,
you're away from the situation.'''
   One of his critics is Michael Flannery, an elderly IRA veteran
and its best-known American supporter. He said Doherty's emphasis
on political rather than military tactics shows ``he doesn't know
Irish history.''
   Politics and diplomacy have failed the Irish in the past,
Flannery said, because they lend legitimacy to British-created
institutions yet do not strike at the source of British power.
   Doherty said some of his remarks have been taken out of context;
he still supports the IRA and does not regret having fought the
British.
   But he also said that since his imprisonment his views have
changed. He described himself as part of a generation that is
determined to end the war that flared 20 years ago when British
soldiers, sent to protect Northern Ireland's Catholic minority from
Protestant attacks, clashed with a revived IRA.
   ``My generation is taking over now, and we're more flexible,
more willing to compromise, less nationalistic,'' he said.
   One summer Doherty was visited by an 11-year-old nephew who was
about to return to Belfast. Doherty said that when he asked the boy
what he was going to do when he returned home, he replied, ``I'm
going to join the IRA and shoot British soldiers.''
   ``I don't want little Sean to be sitting at the kitchen table,
stripping a Thompson machine gun like I was,'' Doherty said. ``I
don't want this to get passed to another generation.''
   Doherty repeatedly expressed optimism, rare in discussions of
Northern Ireland, that political and diplomatic initiatives could
soon bring peace.
   ``Look at Eastern Europe. The world's changing so fast,'' he
said, snapping his fingers. ``This puts a lot of pressure on the
British. They'll soon be the only nation in Europe with troops on
the street.''
   He said the consolidation of the European Economic Community in
1992 will make the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic seem all the more absurd and offer the British a
convenient excuse to go home.
   The IRA should consider a cease-fire, he suggested, and measure
the British response. The British, he predicted, would grab a
chance to negotiate a gradual pullout.
   Doherty states his case calmly and eloquently. Since the age of
17, he has spent all but 18 months of his life on the lam or behind
bars, and the jailhouse has been his schoolhouse. Virtually
illiterate when he left school, Doherty learned Gaelic, Irish
history and debating in a camp for IRA prisoners outside Belfast.
   Doherty's education has continued at the MCC, even though his
maximum security status forbids classroom attendance. He subscribes
to many publications, answers 20 to 30 letters a day and writes
messages for rallies and meetings, many of them related to his
defense.
   He also writes poetry. Two of his poems have won prizes in
federal prison system competitions; one brought him a check for $25
courtesy of Edwin Meese III, whose decision as attorney general had
kept him in jail.
   Despite his frustration over his case, which now is before the
U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, Doherty is confident about
Northern Ireland.
   ``The war is coming to an end, after 800 years,'' he said. ``As
soon as the British leave, I'll burn my (IRA) beret. The IRA is
only the symptom, the product of a situation that never worked.''

   Kathy Blackburn perches on a stool in
front of 28 bowed heads, bullhorn in hand, repeating the Lord's
Prayer.
   A burst of giggles erupts, but the mother of this brood _ 17
boys and 11 girls _ is a picture of tolerance.
   ``I hear kids from the time I wake up until the time I go to
sleep,'' she says. Then she adds, ``There are times I've been
frantic.''
   Mrs. Blackburn, 42, and her husband, Dan, 45, came home to
Indiana at the end of December. The two Christian missionaries and
their wards, all orphaned or abandoned Haitian children ranging in
age from 3 to 14, are temporarily living in a drafty church camp
about 50 miles southeast of Indianapolis.
   The Blackburns, who have two grown children of their own, began
taking in homeless children shortly after becoming missionaries in
1969 and at one time thought about opening an orphanage. Now they
plan to adopt all the children, four of whom are mentally retarded.
   In 1987, violence in Haiti forced the Blackburns to flee to the
Dominican Republic. Last December, they finally received permission
from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service to bring the
children to the United States.
   The children are Rosie and Mary, both 14; Becky, Yvonne and Jim,
12; Tom, Sam, Bobby, Cheryl and Jo Anna, 11; Steve, Marva and Liz,
10; Jemima, Abigail, Aaron, Jeremiah, Benji, Noah and Gideon, 9;
Matthew and Jake, 8; Rachael, 7; Thaddeus, 6; Mike and Caleb, 4,
and Andy and Mark, 3.
   In Haiti, the family had a house; in Indiana, they sleep in a
dormitory heated by a wood stove and use an outdoor privy.
   Down the lane is the ``chow house,'' the hub of the family's
social life. A hand-made sign posted on the refrigerator says:``A
late meal is a hardship with 28 kids. Please have consideration for
the cook. Thanks.''
   Blackburn does the cooking and supervises the older boys, who
wash dishes and sweep floors. The girls do the laundry and care for
the younger children, giving baths and changing clothes.
   Mrs. Blackburn says the secret to managing 28 children and a
household is not to fear mistakes.
   Parenthood is ``something you can't cram for at the last
minute,'' she says. ``We do it by making mistakes, by trial and
error. ... It's just something you keep working at.''
   The Blackburns have many of the same dreams other parents have.
   ``I'd like them to have music lessons, learn to ride a bike,
know history and know it well, and be well-educated within their
own bounds,'' Mrs. Blackburn says.
   The children are taught by the Blackburns and volunteer
teachers, who come to the camp to give lessons in math, science,
reading, writing and sign language, the last a device to keep the
noise level down.
   ``These kids aren't overstimulated,'' Mrs. Blackburn says.
``They enjoy stuff more. A jet going overhead and a beautiful
sunset is a really big deal. They not only appreciate, but they
comment on it.''
   Rosie recently went with Blackburn to a department store, where
she took her first elevator ride.
   ``It's continual questions. Even getting into a car is a big
deal for them,'' Blackburn says.
   As part of their arrangement with immigration authorities, the
Blackburns may not accept government support. Instead, they rely on
regular donations from about 20 churches and whatever else comes
in. Local businesses have donated secondhand clothes and leftover
baked goods. The family has received clothes, food, toys and money
from strangers who have heard about them in news reports.
   ``We're not taking a vow of poverty, but one of the things I
want to discourage is excess, the mindset that you don't need one
thing, you need 10,'' Mrs. Blackburn says.
   The Blackburns' most pressing need is permanent shelter. The
church camp opens May 1, and they must be out. The Rev. Lee Creech,
who has supported the Blackburns' missionary work for 20 years,
heads a committee seeking a home for them.
   ``More people are in awe than anything else that someone would
attempt to do this,'' says Creech, pastor at New Bethel United
Methodist church in Decatur County. ``I think it's the best way for
someone else to say, `I am my brother's keeper.'''

<HEAD>`The Kennedys of Boston' _ Slow Start, But Worth Watching</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's miniseries, ``The Kennedys of
Massachusetts,'' begins so slowly that viewers who tune in the
first episode are likely to tune out the rest. More's the pity, for
there are worthwhile things in this production.
   What saves the miniseries from Hollywood's usual Kennedy
hagiography is splendid acting, not William Hanley's dramatization
of Doris Kearns Goodwin's best seller, ``The Fitzgeralds and the
Kennedys.''
   The best performance is that of William Petersen as Joseph P.
Kennedy Sr., an unusual stretch for an actor best remembered for
the film ``Manhunter,'' in which he played an emotionally maimed
FBI agent tracking a serial killer.
   Petersen creates a living, breathing Joe Sr. from scant
material, and his aging of the character is much more than makeup.
An underrated actor, Petersen can only boost his reputation with
work like this.
   Praise also goes to William Weber, who plays the weedy young JFK
from the inside out. Weber's effective performance hauntingly
captures JFK's manner and characteristic charm without forcing the
lace-curtain Irish accent.
   A startlingly mature Tracy Pollan plays the rebellious debutante
Kathleen ``Kick'' Kennedy, who defied her parents to marry outside
the Roman Catholic Church. Pollan creates a believable Kick, and
when her character is killed in a wartime plane crash, a great deal
of energy leaves the miniseries.
   As Rosemary Kennedy, Deidre Lovejoy plays with strength and
dignity the mentally retarded daughter drowning in a family of
overachievers. Randle Mell, with perhaps five minutes on screen,
evokes a genial Bobby Kennedy who was a poised, astute political
operative.
   Praise goes also to production designer Jan Scott and
cinematographer Laszlo Scott, who filled lush interior locations
with golden light and detailed period touches, letting the actors
dominate the foreground.
   All that said, ``The Kennedys'' ultimately fails under director
Lamont Johnson's misguided attempt to keep faith with a 1,000-page
history of 55 years of private and public Kennedy lives. It's too
much material, even for a miniseries.
   ``The Kennedys'' has triumphs and tragedies aplenty, but its
stuttering, episodic pace forces a simplistic narrative and paints
details with a broad brush, creating a false history from what is
only ``historical drama.''
   The seeming eternal first episode focuses on Mayor John ``Honey
Fitz'' Fitzgerald (Charles Durning) and publican-ward boss P.J.
Kennedy (Pat Hingle) and the courtship of their children, Rose
Fitzgerald (Annette O'Toole) and Joe.
   Durning and Hingle, two of America's great character actors,
have six minutes to evoke Boston's bloody ward politics from a
script that only casually implies Honey Fitz's red-handed role in
them.
   And there is a stupid anachronism. It is 1906 and Rose asks
Harvard freshman Joe if he's read ``The Jungle'' by Upton Sinclair.
``Isn't that one of those `Tarzan of the Apes' books?'' he
facetiously replies.
   No, Joe, ``Tarzan of the Apes'' won't be published until 1914.
If you'd said ``Kipling, eh?'' we might have bought it.
   ``The Kennedys'' picks up steam when Joe, who is becoming one of
the richest men in America, extends his business and extramarital
ventures to Hollywood.
   After his notorious love affair with actress Gloria Swanson
(excellently played by Madolyn Smith Osborne) ends and Joe wraps up
his Hollywood interests, ``The Kennedys'' sinks into another trough
in its sine-wave emotional scheme.
   Another sustained peak arrives with Joe Sr.'s appointment as
U.S. ambassador to Britain and the young adulthood of Jack, Kick,
and Joe Jr. (played by Campbell Scott) as the world plummets into
war.
   Sadly, Jack's reluctant entry into politics and his rise to the
presidency seem to take up only about 15 minutes and the story ends
at his inaugural speech in 1961.

<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial circuits.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   When Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu toured Europe
last month he demonstrated Japan's economic might by announcing
almost $2 billion in aid to Poland and Hungary, dwarfing what the
United States has committed.
   In contrast, private Japanese industries, known for their
aggressive expansion elsewhere, are reluctant to plunge into a part
of the world they see as inexperienced, ill-equipped and still
emerging from 40 years of communism.
   A few prominent deals have been done. Suzuki Motor Co., for
example, recently agreed to set up an automobile plant in Hungary,
the first Japanese company to enter a joint venture with Eastern
Europe since the tumultuous political changes there.
   But Eastern Europe remains virtually untouched by Japanese
business. In 1988, Japan trade with the region totaled about $1.47
billion, excluding the Soviet Union. That's less than 1 percent of
Japanese trade worldwide.
   Although many Japanese firms have offices in Eastern European
nations, only about a dozen joint ventures have been established.
No Japanese company has yet invested in Poland, East Germany or
Czechoslovakia.
   Japanese businessmen have a range of reasons for holding back.
High inflation rates, a heavy debt burden and inconvertible
currencies make it difficult to profit in Eastern Europe, in their
view.
   Restrictions on exports of high technology to the East bloc, a
vestige of the Cold War that remains entrenched, also have reduced
the spectrum of trade opportunities for the Japanese, who are
leading exporters of high-tech items.
   Nonetheless, the changing political and economic landscape of
Eastern Europe has piqued Japan's interest. The government has
allocated $750 million for export insurance to encourage Japanese
firms to trade there.
   To Daihatsu Motor Co., however, economic reform and Japanese
government aid cannot alleviate the tremendous risks it sees.
   One of Japan's smallest automobile manufacturers, Daihatsu has
tried for more than five years to set up an assembly plant in
Poland. Although it developed an ambitious plan to build a
12,000-vehicle-a-year plant with Polish automaker FSO, Daihatsu
failed to acquire enough financing and the plan collapsed.
   Last fall, FSO approached Daihatsu again. This time, said
spokesman Wataru Shindo, the company has considerably scaled down
plans _ it will export about 6,000 unassembled Charade models to
Poland.
   ``We don't know whether we'll be able to meet our costs. At a
scale of 5,000 to 6,000 cars, even if we fail there will be little
damage done,'' Shindo said.
   Japan's largest glass manufacturer expressed the same caution.
Asahi Glass Co. has been negotiating with Poland to set up a plate
glass factory in the southern city of Sandomierz.
   The risks remain high, said Asahi official Shigehiko Tomita, and
no commitment has been made.
   Tomita said trade insurance and other Japanese government
support was necessary, but stability in Eastern Europe was more
important.
   ``The political and economic situation in Poland is still fluid,
and the risks great. The country has high inflation, and even
though we think that democratization will proceed, we need to have
some protection,'' he said.
   Shigeki Ura, a senior officer with merchant trader C. Itoh and
Co. in Eastern Europe, doubted Japanese firms will attempt any
large-scale investments.
   Nevertheless, he added, ``As businessmen specializing in the
Eastern European market, we should not be so optimistic, but not so
pessimistic. Economic reform and democracy will give us chances.''
   Ura said Japanese firms differ fundamentally from European firms
in their attitude toward developing the Eastern European market.
The Japanese want clear-cut laws in place specifying what is
permissible for foreigners, but some European investors are willing
to overlook legal vaguenesses, Ura said.
   Despite Japan's reluctance, its neighbor South Korea seems eager
to exploit opportunity in Eastern Europe. Yoo Chang-soon, chairman
of the Federation of Korean Industries, South Korea's largest
business organization, said recently that ``prospects are bright''
for direct investment there.
   ``Some big entrepreneurs have already studied plans for direct
investment in communist countries,'' he said.
   South Korea established diplomatic relations with Hungary,
Poland and Yugoslavia only last year and has a $91 million trade
surplus with those countries.

<HEAD>After the Lambada _ the Funana</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CIDADE DA PRAIA, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Why get all hot and sweaty
thrashing about the dance floor to a lambada when you can grind
your hips and still keep your cool to the beat of a funana, a
tabanca or a coladera?
   Attention music lovers, the next dance craze could very well
come from Cape Verde, one of the world's original musical melting
pots.
   ``We Cape Verdians take our music at least as seriously as our
politics, but it's difficult to talk of original and indigenous
here,'' said Tober da Silva, a high school teacher in Praia and a
music historian.
   ``Over the course of time, music has profitted, though some
people would say suffered, from our crossroads position between
Africa and America,'' added Mario Bettencourt, who as ``Russo''
plays bass with Cape Verde's top pop group, Os Tubaroes (The
Sharks).
   ``We've drawn influences from every people that has passed
through here,'' he said.
   And those peoples are many.
   Jutting out of the tropical Atlantic, 385 miles off the West
African coast, the 10 formerly Portuguese volcanic islands first
flourished as a trading post for African slaves bound for the
Americas. The slaves left behind basic African rhythms, before
exporting them to Brazil, where the Angolan semba became the samba.
   The islands eventually became a mid-ocean crossover point for
whaling ships, then cargo steamboats and more recently jets from
three continents.
   Crew and tourists from South American ships re-imported the
altered, syncopated beat. Also lured to South America were Cape
Verdian musicians who had adopted strains of Portugal's melancholy
fado folk songs and fused everything into what Russo calls Cape
Verde's mournful ``Afro-Latin'' sound.
   There's been a growing Western interest in international or
ethnic music. In recent years, American and European musical tastes
have made stars of such musicians as Senegalese singer Youssou
``the Lion'' N'dour, Brazil's Milton Nascimento, Polish singer
Basia and salsa's Ruben Blades. And in recent months, the
French-marketed Brazilian lambada _ a sexy, gyrating dance to a
Latin-rock beat _ has become an international commercial success.
   ``The lambada's success should help us get a more international
projection,'' said Zeca Couto, keyboard player for Tubaroes.
   The band consists of seven musicians, whose regular jobs range
from import-export clerk to chief of protocol at Cape Verde's
parliament. Tubaroes has a new contract with a Lisbon-based
recording company to release two new discs this year.
   Their last album, ``Bote, Broce e Linha'' _ what fishermen say
in Portuguese Crioulo when casting their lines _ sold around 10,000
copies. The group considers that to be a heady success, shared only
by Cape Verdian musicians who have emigrated.
   But the Tubaroes' deep-rooted belief in music of the people, for
the people and by the people won't let success go to their heads.
They still jam four nights a week in a ramshackle storeroom, before
singing weekends in their Di Nos nightclub in Praia, where Cape
Verdians dance the funana and coladera.
   ``I don't agree with living abroad. People (abroad) don't
experience the day-to-day life here and so they can't make real
Cape Verdian music,'' said Ildo Lobo, the group's frontman and
vocalist.
   The group sing mornas, slow, melancholy songs about typical
problems of island life. But even their up-tempo funanas and
coladeras have bitingly critical texts.
   According to da Silva, those songs, traditionally accompanied
only by accordion and a two metal bars scraped together and called
``ferrinho,'' were banned before independence from Portugal in 1975.
   ``We deal with problems faced by women ... with emigration _
every house in these islands has some sort of problem linked with
emigration,'' Lobo said.
   Some 700,000 Cape Verdians have left the islands in search of a
better life. More than 350,000 live and work in the United States,
primarily in Massachussetts and Rhode Island. The Tubaroes have
played in Boston five times.
   ``We're still subject to imported influences. Our people abroad
send us all types of music, and we are changing. But what you hear
most here is Cape Verdian,'' Lobo said.
   But Cape Verdians don't ignore culture from other parts of the
world.
   At one main crossroads in downtown Praia a group of
schoolchildren sporting Bob Marley shirts and rastafarian hair
styles dance to the latest craze _ zouk music from the French
Antilles. On the wall behind them, graffiti artists have written
the names Madonna and Michael Jackson.

   Treatment in most states combines two approaches. One teaches
offenders to sabotage deviant fantasies by sniffing something
unpleasant like ammonia or by imagining the consequences, such as
police breaking into a bedroom and catching a child molester in the
act.
   The second approach uses group and individual therapy to break
through the wall of denial and rationalization sex offenders use to
convince themselves their behavior is OK.
   More intrusive techniques have been tried, including shock
therapy and so-called chemical castration, the use of hormones to
reduce sex drive.
   But no treatment has produced anything better than inconclusive
results, Petrella said. And even methods that are encouraging by
medical standards _ say, a treatment that keeps two-thirds of sex
offenders from repeating their crime _ are unacceptable by social
standards.
   In the end, letting a single Earl Shriner back on the streets is
a risk few are willing to take.
   Since Shriner's attack on her son, Helen Harlow has learned a
lot about sex crimes. She's learned that people who abuse others
often were abused as children. She even looked at Shriner once in
court and wondered how he must feel to have a jury deciding the
rest of his life.
   But compassion goes only so far. Doctors say corrective surgery
performed on the boy since last May and additional operations as he
matures should make him physically whole again. But the family may
never be rid of the emotional pain inflicted by Shriner.
   ``A lifetime sentence is a lifetime sentence,'' Harlow said.
``We were given one, and I think he deserves one, too.''

<HEAD>Congress, in Decade of Brain, Considers Curbing Commemorations</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Entering the Decade of the Brain, Congress,
which so designated the 1990s, is thinking about curbing its habit
of passing resolutions to commemorate days, weeks, months and years
for causes somebody deems worthy.
   The thinking probably will go on for quite a while, because
commemorative measures are a quick, cut-rate, harmless way to do a
favor for a constituent, a contributor or an interest group.
   While the brains behind this mini-reform say all those
resolutions waste time and money and make Congress look silly,
passing them is one of the things the House and Senate do most
efficiently.
   In the first year of the current Congress they cranked out 88,
including the brain decade, National Library Card Sign-up Month and
the International Year for Bible Reading.
   Some are a bit tricky. Congress voted to designate last July 14
as National Day to Commemorate the Bastille Day Bicentennial. It
also set aside National Tap Dance Day, which was May 25, although
the measure marking that occasion didn't pass until five months
after it was over. That parliamentary lapse was not typical _ most
name-the-day measures pass quickly and unanimously.
   ``Somewhere along the way, we've let our zeal for commemoratives
get out of hand,'' said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
introducing a bill to restrain the practice.
   Reps. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., and Claudine Schneider, R-R.I.,
proposed similar measures last year, and there are more than enough
co-sponsors to pass a bill should it get to a House vote. Reform,
after all, is as safe and popular a pursuit as passing
commemorative resolutions.
   A decade ago, Congress adopted only 34 commemorative
resolutions. In the 100th Congress, the count was up to 258.
Hollings said the current 101st Congress probably will produce more
than 300.
   At a House hearing earlier this month, McCurdy said the practice
feeds the public perception that Congress wastes too much time on
trivia. Schneider called it an embarrassment and said it makes
members of Congress look foolish.
   To cut the crop of congressionally endorsed observances, the
bills propose creation of an advisory commission on national
commemorative events to sort through all the proposals and decide
which ones deserve to be designated.
   The panel would be authorized to recommend its chosen days,
weeks and months directly to the White House. That way, such an
occasion as National Pledge of Allegiance Day, last observed on
Sept. 8, 1989, could be proclaimed without further action.
   The commission would be patterned on one that now screens the
thousands upon thousands of commemorative stamp proposals the
Postal Service gets each year, helping to winnow them to the 40 or
so that finally are issued.
   It would have 11 members, including two from the House and two
from the Senate. That sounds like the makings of a new, if
miniature, bureaucracy.
   The sponsors of the bills say not, and insist the system they
propose would cost less than Congress is spending now to produce,
process and print its flood of commemorative resolutions.
   Hollings said the commission members would be reimbursed for
their expenses when they met but would operate without any paid
staff.
   But advisory commissions do have a way of hiring help and
posting claims on the budget. The Congressional Budget Office
thinks any savings on commemorative resolutions would be more than
offset by the cost of the new panel.
   Hollings argues that the current way exacts other costs,
diverting the time and energies of Congress members and aides from
substantive work. ``We should honor our constituents not by passing
commemorative after commemorative, but by spending our time working
on legislation that will make a real difference in their lives,''
Hollings said.
   Meanwhile, the occasions to be noted in the new session of
Congress are accumulating _ Federal Employees Recognition Week,
Drinking Water Week, Be Kind to Animals Week, just to commemorate a
few.
   And about that brain decade, which began Jan. 1. It was
designated in connection with the 160th anniversary of the birth of
a Silas Mitchell, credited with founding the science of neurology.
   ``The decade of the brain,'' said Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass.,
when he proposed the resolution. ``Think about it.''

   Rock 'n' roll. Kids love it, parents hate it.
   And as the music industry celebrates itself at the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards on Wednesday, parents groups, religious organizations
and state legislatures have declared war on rock.
   Some rock lyrics, they say, advocate sex, drugs, subversion and
violence, and they aim to put a stop to that.
   For more than 30 years, rock 'n' roll has been a
multibillion-dollar winner for record companies.
   But for every tune welcomed by parents such as Billy Joel's ``We
Didn't Start the Fire,'' which has been praised for offering
youngsters an instant history lesson, others are condemned as unfit
for children.
   Legislators have stepped in with a direct message. It's a small,
yellow flourescent sticker on records, compact discs and cassettes:
   ``Warning: May contain explicit lyrics descriptive of or
advocating one or more of the following: suicide, incest,
bestiality, sadomasochism, sexual activity in a violent context,
murder, morbid violence, illegal use of drugs or alcohol.''
   That's what a bill recently passed by the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives would require for records containing any of the
above in song lyrics. A proposed Missouri law would add ``nudity''
to the list. Florida would include ``sexual activity.''
   Iowa, Arizona, Maryland and Oklahoma have also drawn up
legislation, and Virginia, Alaska, New Mexico, Illinois, Delaware
and Kansas are considering similar measures.
   While rock 'n' roll and all its lyrics go prime time on the
Grammys, record stores around the country are being pressured to
keep things clean:
   _The 450-store national Trans World chain now sells stickered
products in its Florida stores only to those 18 or older as the
result of a ``sting'' operation by Florida attorney Jack Thompson
in which minors purchased unedited versions of rap group 2 Live
Crew's records.
   The 52-store Spec's Music chain, based in Florida, and the
70-store Nashville, Tenn.-based Sound Shop chain have adopted
similar policies.
   _Last year, Tommy Hammond, a record shopkeeper in Alexander
City, Ala., was convicted of obscenity for selling 2 Live Crew's
``Move Something'' LP, which contains a tune titled ``S&amp;M.''
Although the customer was a local police officer, Hammond was told
by the arresting officer, ``Nobody's old enough to buy it in this
state.'' Hammond was fined $500 by the city court and has appealed
to a circuit court.
   _In May 1989, Ouachita County Sheriff Jack Dews seized a number
of rap and heavy metal tapes from the WalMart chain and Hear the
Blues record stores in Camden, Ark. ``They had them displayed in
open cases, some on open counters,'' Dews said. ``A 10-year-old
could buy them and they were clearly labeled as obscene.''
   Rap and heavy metal are the prime targets, but mainstream stars
have also come under attack. Madonna's ``Like a Prayer'' commercial
for Pepsi was pulled after a threatened boycott by Mississippi
preacher Donald Wildmon, who heads the American Family Association.
Mick Jagger said Columbia Records asked the Rolling Stones to
delete words from the inner sleeve of their ``Dirty Work'' album.
   ``One of the things that Hitler was real good at and very shrewd
in doing was developing the youth,'' said Mike Shelton, a police
officer in Union City, Calif., and author of the training manual
``Punk Rock &amp; Heavy Metal: The Problem-One Solution.''
   ``Much of that was about distinct uniforms, distinct lifestyles
and distinct music. Music can influence particular young people,''
he said.
   Tipper Gore, president of the Parents Music Resource Center
(PMRC), agrees. She says youngsters are influenced by ``the
glorification of violence.''
   A year ago, multiplatinum-artist Bobby Brown was dragged from
the stage of the Municipal Auditorium in Columbus, Ga., and
arrested for ``dancing suggestively.'' In Cincinnati, rappers NWA
and Too $hort were fined for giving ``obscene'' performances.
   In April 1989, platinum-selling Metallica, a heavy metal group,
was forced to cancel a show at Notre Dame University because of
``bad publicity.''
   Ever since Elvis Presley appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan Show,''
censors have sought to confine rock 'n' roll to the waist up.
Rock's defenders insist the latest wave of criticism is simply the
same old song.
   ``To me the rock 'n' roll attitude is live and let live,'' said
Bill Adler, of Rush Artists Management, whose clients include
rappers Public Enemy, Run-DMC and LL Cool J.
   ``I don't believe the issue is a couple of dirty rap records.
What's going on here is there's kind of a cultural war in progress.
This music has always been under attack by elements of the
Christian fundamentalist right ever since it first surfaced in the
mid-1950s.''
   But organizations such as PMRC, which pressures record companies
to label products, claim customers have a right to know what's in
the stores. PMRC insists it's not looking to pull the plug on rock,
but merely to jiggle the wires.
   PMRC prefers a voluntary system much like the rating system for
movies between filmmakers and the Motion Picture Association of
America Inc.
   ``Specifically, we're interested in material that is impacting
children,'' executive director Jennifer Norwood said. ``We don't
monitor every record. It has more to do with than just a
four-letter word. We are dealing with material that is so graphic.''

   In 1985, PMRC and the Recording Industry Association of America
reached agreement on voluntary labeling. Records with lyric content
relating to ``explicit sex, explicit violence or explicit substance
abuse'' would carry the label ``Explicit Lyrics _ Parental
Advisory,'' or have lyrics visible on the jacket.
   However, the industry has not always honored the agreement,
Norwood said.
   ``The Beastie Boys didn't carry a label,'' she said of their
``License to Ill'' LP, ``and it had 95 references to drugs and
alcohol. Motley Crue has never been labeled, and they carry
numerous references to sex and graphic violence.''
   Voluntary legislation isn't enough for some state legislators.
Rep. Don Hermann of Iowa has sponsored a labeling bill, and said
recently in an interview with Billboard that he's ``sick'' of songs
with lyrics ``outside the norm, like this Elton John song about
`Sally' that isn't a girl at all but about a homosexual.''
   Judith Toth, a Democrat in the Maryland House of Delegates, has
proposed a labeling law that would impose up to a $1,000 fine and
up to one year in jail for a first offense, and $5,000 and up to
three years imprisonment for subsequent offenses.
   ``There's just a movement within rock groups that doesn't
care,'' she said. The movement includes most rap groups and
``skinhead music'' performers, whose lyrics Toth says degrade
racial and ethnic minorities.
   Opponents to mandatory labeling include the record industry
association, civil liberties groups, music critics, a number of
rock stars _ notably Frank Zappa _ and the National Association of
Recording Merchandisers, which represents retailers.
   Beach Boy Mike Love, whose group was attacked by former
Secretary of the Interior James Watt for attracting the ``wrong
element,'' contributed money to the PMRC. But Donny Osmond, a
Mormon and longtime supporter of conservative causes, has condemned
labeling.
   In the middle are the retailers themselves, who insist their
hands are tied between satisfying local complaints and respecting
freedom of expression. They have not hesitated, however, to point
an accusing finger at the recording industry.
   ``It would be our hope that the manufacturers would take it upon
themselves to determine product that may contain objectionable
material and choose either not to publish that or to affix warning
labels to that product,'' said Jim Williamson, a Trans World vice
president.
   ``I'd like to see the manufacturers take a responsible stand,''
said Vicky Carmichael, vice president of Spec's. ``It's a tough
situation. No matter what you do, someone is going to be unhappy.
We want to do what is good for our business and do what's right. We
have some customers who purchase the explicit lyrics and some who
are offended.''
   But what defines ``offensive'' or ``obscene''? Should minors be
permitted to purchase Kurt Weill's satirical opera ``The Threepenny
Opera,'' which features murder, bigamy and prostitution?
   ``Yes, it's sticky,'' Carmichael admitted. ``I think's this
country is swinging back more conservatively. I see it happening _
the penalties they want to have.''
   Retailers also fear mandatory labeling would turn them into
involuntary censors. A record store owner might have to monitor
every album in the store to make sure no ``explicit'' lyrics were
left unmarked.
   ``There's no way in the world a person could do that,'' said
Hammond, the Alexander City record store owner. ``Even if I could
do that, who am I to try to tell another person what they can or
can't listen to. I can't even tell you what pornography is. How am
I supposed to tell others what it is?''
   Labeling opponents have accused the record industry of caring
more about dollar signs than yellow stickers. Critics note that the
industry association's agreement with the PMRC came while the
industry was lobbying Congress for a tax on blank cassettes and
insist that artistic freedom is still not a primary concern.
   ``All the record industry wants is to be able to do business,''
said Lee Ballinger, an associate editor for the newsletter Rock &amp;
Roll Confidential. ``They want to lobby the government for a
uniform labeling bill. They want to make money, they don't care.''
   Charles Ruttenberg, the general counsel for the retailers
association, denies this, insisting that record industry people
have the same concerns as anyone else:
   ``I think that all the people I've talked with, they all have
families, they have children. I don't think they're in it just to
make money. They're trying to make sure children aren't injured.''

   The Middlesex County, N.J., prosecutor's office
monitors the music and literature of hate crime suspects as part of
a special task force.
   ``The component evaluates the effects of heavy metal lyrics on
the acts of vandalism,'' county prosecutor Alan Rockoff said about
the Joint Unit to Stop Terrorism, which was formed four years ago
in response to an outbreak of racist and anti-Semitic incidents.
   ``We've found not only the heavy metal influence but a
progression from heavy metal music and the fixation or obsession
with violence, weapons and thunderbolts and knives, things like
that, that has evolved as sort of a genesis into these white
supremacists affiliations,'' he said. ``They seem to be putting
graffiti on buildings now and attacking people solely on the basis
of color.''
   Rockoff said that when a hate crime is committed, the procedure
is to find probable cause and then obtain a search warrant for the
suspect's home.
   ``With that search warrant, we make observations in the homes
and particularly the rooms. What motivates them? What literature do
they read?''
   But the New Jersey branch of the American Civil Liberties Union
objects to the procedure.
   ``I think that it's unconstitutional because what someone reads
or listens to is part of the private person,'' said ACLU legal
director Deb Ellis. ``It's not a crime to be part of an Aryan
organization or read Aryan literature. What you're looking for is
evidence of the actual illegal act.''
   But, said Rockoff, ``There is no apology that has to be made by
law enforcement offcials for trying to uncover the motivation or
commission for criminal acts.
   ``You want to know why he picked on the particular icon. You
look for evidence, whether it's rope or whatever. When you are in
the inner sanctuary, you have a perfect right to try to learn what
motivated that young person.''
   The prosecutor cited a case in which a group of young people
were indicted for placing swastikas, anti-Semitic slurs and
statements such as ``6 Million More, Why Not?'' on the walls of the
B'Nai Brith Hillel Foundation at Rutgers University in New
Brunswick.
   ``We have learned that some of the individuals involved had
affiliations to a white, Aryan supremacy organization. From that
literature we have gained a great deal of insight into skinhead
culture.
   ``We're not looking at any idealogical movement or political
movement or liberal or conservative or civil rights or law
enforcement,'' Rockoff said. ``Nor do I want to be called a zealot.
   ``It is not an idealogical police force. I am not a censor. I am
just a cop trying to do his job.''

<TEXT>
   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September,
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water
treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly
sparking a water emergency.
   ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to
the problem,'' said LePage, water treatment superintendent in
Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie's western edge.
   At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the
green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now
infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December's
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they
quickly settled inside the plant.
   ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's
warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal
for them,'' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at
the plant. ``By July, we're going to have a massive problem with
them.''
   Three years after they were introduced to North America and
after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake
Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It's an invasion
scientists say could affect farming, fishing and daily life along
virtually every body of fresh water in North America in the next
few years.
   The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can
reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by
filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings
them a steady supply of fresh food.
   A mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour, said R.
Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State
University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave water
cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would
certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said.
   Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds,
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said
Charles O'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University
College at Brockport.
   The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and
some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the
billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry.
   And the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline.
Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes
can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because
of the shells, O'Neill said.
   ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet
to the water at your tap,'' O'Neill said. ``It's not just an
environmental problem.''
   Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in
theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian
researchers tried steaming a bunch, O'Neill said, ``What they got
was a stench that cleared the lab.''
   The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are
believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that
emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake
Erie, in 1986.
   Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie
infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986
event, O'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested
the lake because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells.
``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that
period of time,'' he said.
   For public water systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of
applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the
plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have
already faced the problem.
   Power plants have a different problem, because officials are
reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in
cooling water discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara
Mohawk and the state Department of Environmental Conservation are
negotiating a solution.
   James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk water plant, is
studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe's mouth, like
building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine
pipe out through the intake. ``We're better off than the people in
the western end of the lake,'' Sell said.
   ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.''
   The City Council hasn't been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for
the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to
show visitors, said, ``I don't see much option for them if they
want a water supply.''
   Farther inland, many water officials are unaware of the problem
or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of
the state Health Department's bureau of public water supply
protection, said the department was studying the problem but
doesn't see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word's
getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in
the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of
that sort.''
   O'Neill and other scientists said the state should do more to
get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not
necessarily very much time.
   ``The chances of them getting into the western reach of the Erie
Canal is good,'' O'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for
them to live. It's warm. It's shallow. Most of it has rock riprap
to attach to.''
   Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their
engine housings and other places where water collects.
   Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost
certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi
River basin, O'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is
utilizing surface water should be concerned.''

<HEAD>AIDS Kills 33 Romanian Babies, 20 Others Stricken

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious AIDS outbreak has killed
33 infants or toddlers since July and stricken 20 others in a
country not prepared to prevent the spread of the fatal disease.
   The victims are from 4 months to 3 years old and come from three
areas: Bucharest in the south, southernmost Giurgiu and Constanta
on the Black Sea Coast to the southeast, said Dr. Ludovic Paun of
the Infectious Diseases Department at the Victor Babes Hospital
here in the nation's capital.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome was first diagnosed in
Romania in 1985, but it wasn't until July that it began showing up
in young children, he said. ``It was a big surprise for us, for
everybody. It's incredible.''
   Since 1985, 69 people have been diagnosed with AIDS in Romania,
and 45 have died. Fifty-three of the cases _ and 33 of the deaths _
were in children.
   A total of 371 Romanians have been shown in initial tests to be
carrying the AIDS virus, Paun said. Of those, 268 are children.
   Victor Babes Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases,
is treating 65 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related infections in an
isolated, three-story building at the edge of the 600-bed complex,
Paun said.
   The three adult AIDS patients have separate rooms, but the
infants are crammed into wards crowded with white-painted iron
cribs, separated into rooms for those with confirmed AIDS and those
with related infections.
   In one room _ with the word ``Confirmati,'' or confirmed, on the
door _ 10 infants stared out from cribs spread with blue, brown or
plaid blankets. One about a year old had sunken cheeks and thin,
white hair.
   ``We have to keep them together because we can only heat so many
rooms and to have them in a controlled situation for the staff to
handle,'' said Paun.
   Authorities do not know how so many children became infected
since a thorough epidemiological investigation has not been
completed, Paun said. ``All these children came from institutions,
from orphanages or hospital units for'' children who are undersized
for their age.
   ``It might have been possible for the disease to spread through
instruments that were not properly sterilized,'' he said. AIDS
cases among Soviet children have in at least two instances been
traced to infected needles; many East bloc nations do not have
disposable syringes that are common in the West.
   Authorities are now investigating individual orphanages and
hospitals, said Dr. Dan Daiculescu, a colleague of Paun's. ``What's
important is how they contracted it. This is a tragic problem.''
   In only five cases did parents of the infected children have
positive blood tests for AIDS, but not all parents were tested,
Paun said. He added that since the children were at least several
months old when first tested, doctors were uncertain how many of
the victims might have been born with AIDS.
   More than 15,000 blood tests conducted since 1985 do not
indicate there is a ``special community'' of AIDS victims in
Romania, the way that homosexuals and drug users are at greater
risk in the West, Paun said.
   Romanian doctors are only beginning to learn about AIDS, he
said, and the public knows almost nothing of the disease that
damages a body's immune system, since little was published during
the rule of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   As part of Ceausescu's program to increase Romania's population
from 23 million to 30 million by the turn of the century, condoms
were only available on the black market at high prices until the
dictator's downfall in December.
   Daiculescu said a radio and TV campaign was needed to warn
Romanians of the dangers of AIDS, but that no money was available
for such a project. ``We don't have the material suport we need,''
Paun agreed, adding that the hospital did not have AZT or other
up-to-date drugs for treating AIDS patients.
   At one point during a tour, the children in one ward were all
crying, and Daiculescu explained they just had injections
antibiotics.
   The Romanian Health Ministry is organizing five regional centers
to test for AIDS to more carefully measure how widespread the
disease is, Paun said. Doctors are managing to cope with the spread
of AIDS, he said, but there are fears that they might be
overwhelmed by many more cases. ``We don't have very many patients
but in the future we may have a problem.
   ``The virus is present and the danger is present.''

   James Sorg can visualize the bearings and
wheels spinning flawlessly, and is convinced that one day they'll
do the same in real life, a machine churning endlessly, powered
only by gravity.
   ``Gravity is an energy source that does not pollute, does not
need storage, does not need transportation,'' said Sorg, 53.
``Everyone in the world has an adequate supply. No country would
need what another country has got.''
   The farmer and airline worker says that after 46 years of
figuring and tinkering, he has found a way to disprove a basic law
of physics. In his barn, the 12-foot-tall wheel studded with
barbells and rollerskate parts only rotates a couple times before
coming to a stop. But it's just a rough draft.
   Bureaucrats and scientists scoff, but they laughed at
Christopher Columbus, too, Sorg said. ``They can't understand. They
say, `You're crazy. Get out of here.' Mentality of that nature used
to teach that the world was flat.''
   Sorg's ``gravity-operated machine'' shares the barn with a
restless calf on his 100-acre farm, where he also is developing a
new breed of cattle. ``I'm always thinking about something,'' he
said.
   ``When I was 7 years old my uncle bought an old brass candy
scale. I thought if you could just bring the weight across from one
side to the other you could keep it swinging back and forth
forever.''
   Sorg, who never went to college or studied physics, said he made
dozens of stabs at perpetual motion before deciding on the flywheel
design in 1980. After a long struggle, it was patented in March as
an ``energy conservator'' because the U.S. Patent Bureau won't even
consider perpetual motion machines.
   Perpetual motion can never occur, said Joseph Chalmers, head of
the physics department at the University of Louisville. The laws of
thermodynamics say any engine will lose energy through friction,
ultimately coming to a stop. ``We don't just enunciate these laws
to hear ourselves talk,'' he said.
   Human nature being what it is, of course, there's no shortage of
people who over the years have been willing to attempt what others
say is impossible.
   Sorg's machine has an 8-foot-wide metal wheel with 12 weights on
axles mounted around the perimeter, each directly opposite another
and linked to its mate by a cable. As the wheel turns and a weight
rises to top center, an arm connected to it meets a cam, causing
the weight to move away from the wheel.
   ``The cable between the opposite weights raises the one at the
bottom, which makes the one at the bottom weightless at the bottom
of the flywheel and places its weight at the top of the flywheel,
which adds force at the top of the flywheel which causes the
rotation,'' Sorg explains.
   As he sets the weights in the proper position, his machine
strains forward, and when the brake is released it begins turning
slowly, making two revolutions before a weight sticks in the wrong
position.
   If the machine was precisely balanced, it would spin until it
wore out, Sorg said. ``They say it's not supposed to move on its
own, but it does. They say it's not supposed to turn even one full
revolution, but it does.''
   Chalmers said the device might be useful as a way of conserving
energy, but lifting the weights will use the same amount of energy
as is given by the opposite weight falling. At the same time,
energy is lost to friction.
   ``A similar machine was proposed well over 100 years ago, with
levers and what-not around a circle. You give it a spin and it
probably spins for a long time. But in terms of going forever, it's
certainly not going to do that.''
   Although every scientist he seeks to convince rejects his ideas,
Sorg is steadfast. He continues to work on two models and plans a
third.
   ``Somebody someplace will be interested enough to come out here
to see it just out of curiousity,'' he said, ``and they'll be able
to help me find a machine shop to build it the way it needs to be.''

<HEAD>Teens, Young Adults Seem Most Vulnerable to Suicide Clusters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Teen-agers and young adults are most vulnerable
to suicide clusters, in which one suicide seems to trigger at least
one more, a study suggests.
   Analysis of federal records for 1978-1984 found that clustering
occurred some two to four times more often in the age groups 15-19
and 20-24 than in older age groups, researchers said. A cluster was
defined as two suicides in the same county within seven, 14 or 30
days. Each time period was analyzed separately.
   For the seven-day period, for example, researchers found 1,420
such pairs of suicides among teen-agers 15 to 19, 6 percent higher
than would be expected by chance.
   Clusters account for relatively few suicides among young people,
but they may be particularly preventable, wrote the researchers
from Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and
School of Public Health, the New York State Psychiatric Institute
and the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   The CDC has developed recommendations for a community plan to
prevent and contain suicide clusters, they said.

<HEAD>Study Says Pill Helps Prevent Chlamydia-Caused PID</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Birth control pills may offer some protection
against pelvic inflammatory disease caused by chlamydia _ the most
common sexually transmitted disease in the nation _ but not PID
caused by gonorrhea, researchers say.
   Chlamydia, a bacterial infection, is blamed for about half the
cases of PID in women. It can lead to chronic pelvis pain,
miscarriage and infertility, and infants born to infected mothers
can suffer pneumonia and eye infections.
   ``This is a little different than previous studies that have
said that birth control pills protect aginst PID, period,'' said
Dr. Paul Wolner-Hanssen of the University of Washington. ``This is
kind of a good news, bad news result. What we say is, `Yes it's
true, it does protect you aginst PID if you have chlamydia, but it
does not protect you against PID if you have gonorrhea.'''
   The researchers led by Wolner-Hanssen studied 141 women with PID
who attended one of three clinics at the university's Harborview
Medical Center and 739 randomly selected, sexually active women
with no signs of the disease.
   A comparison of women who had chlamydia and PID with those who
only had chlamydia showed that those who had chlamydia but took
oral contraceptives were five times less likely to get PID than
those who used another or no method of birth control,
Wolner-Hanssen said. The results were not significant when women
with gonorrhea were compared, suggesting the pill does not protect
them.
   The results did not differ appreciably when adjusted for age,
race, years of education, age at first intercourse, frequency of
intercourse, or history of the sexually transmitted diseases, but
the researchers noted the study could have been influenced by
factors such as willingness to seek health care.
   The study was published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.

   A new technique could increase the
storage capacity of compact disks by 1,666, according to its
developer, who says it would allow 18,000 Encyclopedia Britannicas
or 10 days' worth of music on one CD.
   A 12-inch compact disk using the technology could hold a
terabyte _ a trillion bytes, or characters _ of information, says
Tuan Vo-Dinh, a physical chemist. A conventional CD can hold 600
million bytes, the equivalent of about 270,000 typewritten pages; a
terabyte would be nearly 450 million pages.
   An set of Encyclopaedia Britannica has about 25,000 pages.
   Conventional CD storage uses lasers essentially to burn holes
into a disk. A computer needs only ``ones'' and ``zeroes'' to work.
The burned bits could be ``zeroes'' and the untouched, reflecting
bits ``ones,'' or vice versa.
   Even the hole burned by a laser is bigger than the 1,000
molecules Vo-Dinh says he can alter. The number needed to store a
bit _ eight bits make a byte _ could be cut to 100 or so. ``The
theoretical limit is one molecule. But you would need a very
sensitive detector to see just one molecule.''
   Vo-Dinh's technique, called Surface Enhanced Raman Optical Data
Storage, is based on a phenomenon discovered in the 1920s called
the Raman Optical Effect, which says the light-emitting properties
of molecules can be altered.
   SERODS lends itself to confidential data storage because it can
reflect signals at a particular frequency, said Guven Yalcintas,
director of technology for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where
Vo-Dinh works.
   ``A selective frequency is very difficult to decifer,''
Yalcintas said, adding that SERODS also holds the potential for
three-dimensional data storage, increasing its capacity and
versatility even further.
   Yalcintas estimates it will take about $5 million and two years
to make a commercially viable product, but says there already is
interest.
   ``The Navy is interested in sending out paperless ships. NASA is
interest in using it to store images and bring them back to Earth.
The National Archives are interested. The Air Force is thinking
about it to store a very large amount of information, a picture of
the surface, and present an image to the pilot,'' he said. ``You
can count on and on and on.''

   The Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
Jones Lang Wooten have announced a $2 billion real estate
investment program to buy property around the world.
   It is Prudential's first major step to extend its real estate
activities beyond North America, the company said in a statement
released Wednesday.
   The Prudential Global Real Estate Investment Programme is
designed to help companies acquire a real estate portfolio spread
among major cities in several countries. Plans are to invest in
prime real estate assets over 3-5 years.
   Robert E. Riley, chairman of the Prudential Realty Group, and
Keith Douglas-Mann, chairman of Jones Lang Wooten, said in a joint
statement: ``Each member of the program's elite investor group
brings significant knowledge of its own part of the world.''
   The combined experience and resources will complement each other.
   Cities under consideration for investment include Frankfurt,
West Germany; London; Paris; Sydney, Australia; and Toronto; as
well as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.
   Eight companies have committed a total of $2 billion to the
program, including: Prudential; Nationale-Nederlanden NV, the
Netherlands; Australian Mutual Provident Society; Government of
Singapore Investment Corp. Pte Ltd. (GSIC); and SPP, Sweden.
   The names of the three other companies that have committed money
have not been disclosed, said Melanie Keenan, spokeswoman for Jones
Lang.
   The Prudential Realty Group, headquartered in Newark, manages
more than $45 billion in real estate assets and has 24 offices
throughout the United States.
   Jones Lang Wooten, based in London, has 58 offices worldwide,
including a U.S. headquarters in New York. It specializes in
investment and corporate real estate services.

<HEAD>ICC Reduces Service on D&amp;H Railway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Service on Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway
lines were to be cut back today, pending a hearing Friday before a
federal agency to consider a proposal to keep the bankrupt railroad
on the tracks, according to a bankruptcy trustee.
   Francis P. Dicello, court-appointed trustee for D&amp;H, said he had
not seen the order issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission
Wednesday night, but was told ``it reduced service for the next two
days'' pending the outcome of the hearing. No other officials could
be reached for comment on the order.
   The ICC is expected to consider a proposal to keep D&amp;H running
for at least 30 days. The proposal was submitted by the New York
Susquehanna and Western Railroad, a subsidiary of Delaware Otsego
Corp. In addition, Canadian National Railroad said it will help
cover some of the costs NYS&amp;W will incur if the proposal is
approved.
   NYS&amp;W and Canadian National both lost in efforts to purchase D&amp;H
during proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington.
   Dicello, who was appointed trustee in 1988, chose Canadian
Pacific Ltd. as the successful bidder for D&amp;H in January over NYS&amp;W
and four other bidders. Canadian National wanted to make a bid in
court last Friday, but lost its financial backing before the
hearing.
   CP had agreed to purchase the ailing railroad for $35 million,
but the transaction was contingent on whether it could obtain track
rights from Conrail from Harrisburg, Pa., to Hagerstown, Md. An
agreement could not be reached and CP withdrew its purchase offer.
D&amp;H faced shutdown proceedings at midnight Wednesday if there had
been no action by the ICC.
   During an emergency hearing in bankruptcy court Wednesday to
determine D&amp;H's fate, Walter Rich, NYS&amp;W president and chief
executive officer, said if D&amp;H is allowed to continue to operate,
it could continue to provide service with no disruptions to 99
percent of its shippers.
   D&amp;H is the nation's oldest continually operating railway. The
ICC designated NYS&amp;W to operate D&amp;H after the rail line went into
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1988. Creditors have about $100 million in
claims against the railroad.
   NYS&amp;W's proposal to keep D&amp;H operating has the backing of the
Federal Railroad Administration.
   ``We've been fighting to try to save the railroad for weeks
now,'' said Gil Carmichael, federal railroad administrator.
   Carmichael said he was encouraged to see a partnership formed
between Canadian National and NYS&amp;W to finance continued operations
of D&amp;H, instead of the states of New York and Pennsylvania using
taxpayers' money to keep D&amp;H running.
   He would not speculate on whether NYS&amp;W and Canadian National
would make a bid for D&amp;H. But Carmichael did say he has known
``Rich wanted to buy D&amp;H for a long time and CN wanted to be a
player in it,'' based on last week's failed attempt to bid for the
line.
   The Conrail tracks at issue with CP are on a route that connects
with CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads at Hagerstown. D&amp;H already
connects with the two railroads at Philadelphia and Buffalo, N.Y.
   CP's purchase agreement was to have expired at midnight Tuesday,
but was extended. In the absence of a purchase agreement and with
no pending bids Wednesday, Dicello said officials had planned to
begin shutting down shipping over D&amp;H rail lines if the ICC had not
intervened. A complete shutdown would have taken four to five days,
according to Stanley Samorajczyk, an attorney for Dicello.
   Plans would then be made to begin selling off D&amp;H's assets.
   D&amp;H, which began in 1824 as a canal company, runs 20 to 25
trains daily in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Quebec. It owns 550 miles of track and has traffic rights to
another 1,000, according to Ken Willsey, Delaware Otsego spokesman.
   A shutdown would put 672 employees out of work and eliminate the
hope of return for 100 to 150 others on furlough, he said.

<TEXT>
   Drackett Co., the Cincinnati-based maker of
Windex, Drano, and other cleaning products, is losing its third
president in six years.
   The company confirmed Wednesday that Douglas G. Cowan, who has
been Drackett's president since April 1988, would take an
indefinite leave of absence for health reasons. Cowan, 56, is
believed to have heart problems.
   Taking his place will be Thomas L. Dahl, president of branded
consumer products for Weyerhaeuser Co., a paper products and lumber
company from the Seattle, Wash., area.
   Dahl, 44, officially will join Drackett today as executive vice
president. He will become president April 1.
   Drackett spokesman David S. Perkins confirmed Cowan's plans.
   In 1984, Nick Evans, who had been Drackett's president since
1966, left the company to become a senior executive at its parent
company, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. William F. Flatley took Evans'
job, but left in 1988, also for a spot in the parent company.
   Cowan, who joined Drackett in 1983, was promoted from senior
vice president following Flatley's departure.
   Cowan came to Drackett after 27 years at the Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. of Cincinnati. When he left P&amp;G as director of product
development for packaged soaps and detergents, P&amp;G sued Drackett,
saying Cowan would leak trade secrets. The suit was settled out of
court.
   Before joining Weyerhaeuser, Dahl was president of the infant
care business at Kimberly-Clark Corp., where he made that company's
Huggies disposable diaper the No.1 brand, displacing P&amp;G's Pampers.

   Interest costs cut fourth-quarter and 1989
profits at General Motors Corp.'s financing arm, and the expense of
job cuts reduced earnings at the automaker's electronics and
aerospace unit, the companies said.
   While General Motors Acceptance Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics
Corp. reported declines, the third major GM subsidiary, Electronic
Data Systems Corp., said Wednesday its profits grew as it added
data services customers.
   GM and Ford Motor Co. were scheduled to report earnings today.
Chrysler Corp. released results Tuesday, including a $664-million
fourth-quarter loss due to belt-tightening staff cuts and plant
closings.
   GMAC, the auto finance, insurance and mortgage branch, said its
costs of borrowing funds increased to an average of 9.33 percent in
1989 from 8.28 percent in 1988. Costs of low-interest financing
incentives offered GM car buyers are subsidized by the automaker
and don't impact GMAC results, spokesman John Andrews said.
   GMAC reported net income of $251.2 million for October-December,
down from $257.4 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. Gross
revenue for the quarter was $3.6 billion, up from $3.4 billion a
year earlier, GMAC said.
   For the year, GMAC said it had net income of $1.11 billion, down
from $1.19 billion in 1988. The company said 1989 gross revenue was
$14.5 billion, up from $13.5 billion in 1988.
   GMAC doesn't have a separate issue of stock based on its
earnings. EDS earnings are the base for GM Class E stock. GM Class
H stock is linked to GM Hughes Electronics profits.
   GM Hughes Electronics, parent company of Hughes Aircraft Co. and
Delco Electronics Corp., built four communications and one weather
satellite launched in 1989.
   The company reported fourth-quarter net income of $183 million,
or 46 cents per share of GM Class H stock, up from $169.5 million,
or 43 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1988. Quarterly
revenue dropped to $2.9 billion from $3.1 billion a year earlier,
the company said.
   For the year, GM Hughes Electronics reported net earnings of
$781.2 million, or $1.94 a share, on revenue of $11.4 billion,
compared with $802.1 million, or $2.01 a share, on revenue of $11.2
billion in 1988.
   Net earnings would have been $812 million, or $2.02 a share,
without non-recurring charges of $30.8 million, or 8 cents a share,
for early retirement and severance costs to cut Hughes employment
to 66,000 from 75,000, spokesman Bruce McCristal said.
   EDS said new data services customers including Cummins Engine
Co. and Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. helped it boost
profits 15.5 percent for the quarter and 13.3 percent for the year.
   EDS reported quarterly net income of $119.5 million, or 50 cents
per GM Class E share, up from $103.4 million, or 42 cents a share,
in the third quarter of 1988. Revenue was $1.43 billion for the
quarter, up from $1.3 billion, EDS said.
   EDS reported net income of $435.3 million, or $1.81 a share, on
revenue of $5.47 billion for 1989, up from $384.1 million, or $1.57
a share, on revenue of $4.84 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Utility Company Lost Almost $500 million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entergy Corp., parent of utilities in
Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, says it lost nearly $500
million last year, mainly because of a third-quarter, $900 million
writeoff of the unfinished Grand Gulf 2 nuclear power plant in
Mississippi.
   The company's fourth-quarter income tumbled 74.1 percent.
   Entergy, which last year changed its name from Middle South
Utilities, abandoned Grand Gulf 2 in 1985 when it was only 34
percent complete.
   The 1989 loss came to $2.31 a share, Entergy said.
   Because of the scrapped plant, Entergy took a loss of $679.3
million or $3.32 per share in the third quarter.
   Fourth-quarter 1989 results also were hurt by the Grand Gulf 2
writeoff.
   Net income slumped by 74.1 percent to $15.1 million compared
with $58.3 million in the fourth quarter of 1988. Per-share
earnings fell from 29 cents to eight 8 cents.
   Total operating revenue rose 2.2 percent to $883 million from
$863.5 million.
   Energy sales to retail customers climbed 2.7 percent to $54
million for the year from $52.58 million in 1989.
   Entergy reported that total electric sales in the quarter
increased 2.4 percent. That was mostly a result of an 18.1 percent
jump in wholesale revenues, the company said.
   ``The Grand Gulf writeoff is a one-time hurdle that will benefit
us in the long term,'' said John Cowan, an Entergy executive. ``The
writeoff did not materially affect our cash position nor did it
impact our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock
each quarter at the current level.''
   Writing off Grand Gulf 2 was part of a settlement Entergy
reached with various state and local officials. In return for
Entergy accepting its losses on the abandoned project, local
officials agreed to drop all challenges to the wisdom of building
and operating the Grand Gulf 1 plant.
   Grand Gulf 1 supplies electricity to, and increased rates for,
customers of Arkansas Power &amp; Light, Louisiana Power &amp; Light,
Mississippi Power &amp; Light and New Orleans Public Service Inc.
   The challenges, if the findings went against the utility and
were upheld by the courts, could have forced Entergy companies to
absorb more of the Grand Gulf 1 costs.
   The settlement also resolved a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission audit case involving Grand Gulf.

build 150 planes, but aerospace competitor McDonnell Douglas Corp.
is also in the running, a Boeing official said.
   Dean Thornton, president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group,
said Wednesday that Boeing hopes to complete the deal by the end of
this year. Thornton spoke at the opening of Singapore's Asian
Aerospace 90 air show.
   ``We are in serious talks with China as is McDonnell Douglas,''
Thornton said. ``The Chinese want support from an established
aircraft manufacturer.''
   Negotiations for the project between China and the two aircraft
manufacturers have been going on for more than three years.
   Both companies want to build a short-range aircraft the Chinese
call a Trunkliner. The plane would be used primarily by China's
five regional aircraft companies on domestic runs.
   The planes would be about the same size as a Boeing 737-300 or a
McDonnell Douglas MD-90. Both can seat about 150 passengers.
   McDonnell Douglas already has a joint project with China that
has turned out 13 MD-82 planes and is scheduled to produce 25
aircraft total.
   Last year, the Civil Aviation Administration of China purchased
four planes from Boeing, six from McDonnell Douglas, three from
Airbus Industries and 11 Yun-7s made in China.

<HEAD>Collapse of Big Firms Reflects Decline in Industry, But Others
Survive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   While some big real estate companies have
collapsed during a sharp decline in the market, others have avoided
trouble by redirecting their business and showing more restraint,
experts say.
   ``If (companies) are well managed, they may not raise as much
money, but at least they're surviving,'' said Fuhrman Nettles, vice
president of Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co., a firm that follows the real
estate investment industry.
   On Tuesday, VMS Realty Partners in Chicago announced it was
suspending most payments to creditors and investors because of
``severe cash flow problems.'' At the same time Integrated
Resources Inc. in New York, once a major seller of tax-sheltered
real estate investments, filed for bankruptcy protection.
   Their troubles followed the fall of Southmark Corp. in Dallas,
another major real estate company that filed for bankruptcy last
year.
   The decline in the industry, however, became apparent after
1986, when federal tax law revisions made real estate investments
less attractive. That year, real estate companies raised more than
$10 billion from investors; by 1989, the figure had dropped to an
estimated $3.5 billion.
   Officials at First Winthrop Corp. in Boston saw the changes
coming, and redirected investments from those that offered tax
breaks to those that focused more on cash returns, said Bruce
Guzowski, chief operating officer for the company.
   For example, where the company previously got investors to put
their money into subsidized housing, which provided tax credits,
First Winthrop in 1986 bought a portfolio of hotel and other
commercial properties on the resort island of Nantucket.
   ``The benefits of real estate from a tax perspective went away
with the 1986 tax act,'' Guzowski said.
   First Winthrop also cut its operations ``across the board,'' he
said, declining to elaborate.
   ``I think we saw the market was shrinking and saw a need to
shrink the company,'' he said.
   Other companies, however, apparently tried too hard to keep
growing despite the tax law changes and real estate slumps that
were hitting the Southwest and about to hit the Northeast.
   ``Human enthusiasm takes a long time to wear down,'' Nettles
said.
   Regarding the developments this week with VMS Realty and
Integrated Resources, Nettles said: ``It appears as though they
didn't respond well. It appears both companies followed an
expansionist policy.''
   A common source of trouble for some companies was the high-yield
junk bond market, the same risky financing mechanism that helped
the downfall of the Wall Street investment firm Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   Integrated Resources, deprived of tax shelter investments, moved
aggressively into insurance and mutual funds financed largely
through junk bonds.
   Southmark used junk bonds to finance rapid growth, but the
company was crushed by debt when the real estate market collapsed
in the Southwest.
   First Winthrop, however, avoided the junk bond market.
   ``Fortunately, it's not something we used,'' Guzowski said.
``We've always financed with equity, not debt.''
   ``Let's just say I think we made a wise decision,'' he said.

   The stock market was marginally higher in early,
uneventful trading today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.03 points at
2,626.35 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 10 to 9 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 473 issues
up, 405 down and 539 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.51 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the market remained quiet, as it has been in the
previous two sessions. ``It's a period of just sitting on the
sidelines waiting to see what's going to happen,'' said Hildegarde
Zagorski, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Market participants continued to monitor the unfolding of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s liquidation. The firm, which sought
bankruptcy court protection earlier this week, is in the process of
transferring its businesses to other Wall Street firms.
   Separately, the market was uninspired by an upbeat Commerce
Department report showing a 29.6 percent jump in housing starts
during an exceptionally warm January.
   Among blue chip issues, Reader's Digest, which just went public,
was trading at 21\ a share; Baker Hughes was unchanged at 26&rsqb;, and
IBM was up | at 104&rsqb;. The company, as expected, introduced a new
family of workstations.
   Ford Motor gain \ to 44~; the automaker reported a 28 percent
drop in 1989 profits, but the report was in line with market
expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.14 to 183.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.07 at 358.85.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.22 to
2,624.32.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 749 up, 681
down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 138.53 million
shares, against 144.44 million in the previous session.

   After a multimillion-dollar investment
and retraining program, Ford Motor Co. has begun full-scale
production of its new Explorer sports-utility vehicle.
   ``Sport-utility vehicles are the fastest-growing segment of the
truck market and, with the Explorer, we will be fully competitive
in that segment,'' incoming president Philip Benton Jr. said during
ceremonies marking the start-up at the assembly plant here.
   ``We've bet nearly $600 million on that outcome,'' Benton told
employees and state and local officials Wednesday.
   Benton, who drove the first Explorer off the assembly line, said
his company may become much more truck-oriented in the future,
especially in Europe.
   ``I can't tell you exactly how or when this truck expansion in
Europe will take place but I'm convinced that it will _ and that
Ford, with world-class products such as the Explorer, will be a
leader,'' said Benton, who is scheduled to become the company's
president March 1.
   Benton predicted that the Explorer, available in two- and
four-door models, will sell at perhaps twice the volume of the
Bronco II, which it is replacing. The Bronco II came in only a
two-door model, and Ford officials conceded that climbing into the
back seat almost requires gymnastic talent.
   The plant is expected to turn out 85 Explorers an hour, with
sales to the public beginning next month. The first three vehicles
off the line Wednesday were purchased by employees.
   The Explorer is a family of compact five- or six-passenger
utility trucks, available in either two- or four-wheel drive, with
an improved electronically fuel-injected V-6 engine and either
manual or automatic overdrive transmissions.
   Referring to the European market, Benton said Ford expects it to
adopt ``the American idea that trucks are for carrying people as
well as cargoes. Trucks constitute fully one-third of the
industry's volume each year, and are 40 percent of the (Ford)
division's North American volume.''
   Benton said that percentage is climbing because as part of its
strategy, the company ``will be building more and different kinds
of trucks, for our customers and for our international partners.''
   Later this year, Ford will build two-door 4x4 vehicles at the
Louisville plant for its partner Mazda to sell as the Navajo
through its U.S. dealer network.
   ``It marks the first time a U.S.-based vehicle manufacturer will
make a product for a Japanese company,'' Benton said.

   IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations
today that experts say should help the computer giant win a stake
in an important market it never has mastered.
   ``The opportunity is big _ it's growing at over 30 percent a
year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM,'' President Jack
D. Kuehler told a news conference.
   Kuehler said the new workstations, designed for business users,
``outperform the newest and best that our competitors offer.''
   International Business Machines Corp. aides showed reporters
nine high-performance workstations and computer file-servers, with
prices ranging from $13,000 to more than $74,000.
   Industry analysts say the machines are impressive for their
operating speed and features and should be received favorably by
engineers, their target market.
   Workstations are desktop machines that are much more powerful
than personal computers. Some even match the power of mainframes.
They are used for such processing-intensive tasks as computer
modeling of new products.
   While the workstation market is a small segment of the overall
computer industry, it is among the fastest-growing, and uses for
the machines are expanding.
   IBM introduced a workstation line several years ago, the RT
line, but it captured less than 3 percent of market. Experts
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced.
   The workstation field is dominated by Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   The new IBM machines, like the workstations they replace, are
based on a version of the Unix operating system, the underlying
software that directs basic computer functions.
   Unix, developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., is
becoming the computer industry standard, allowing machines from
different manufacturers to be linked together.
   Until now, IBM had not wholeheartedly embraced Unix, preferring
its own proprietary operating systems instead. The fact that the
workstations are Unix-based shows IBM is serious about this market,
analysts say.
   Like the older IBM workstations, the new models also are based
on reduced-instruction-set computing technology, or RISC, which
simplifies the circuitry of a computer's central processor to
increase speed and offer cost savings. The powerful machines are
expected to offer color, 3-D graphics capability.
   Analysts say one factor in the success of the new line, called
the RISC System 6000, will be the availability of applications
software, or the programs that provide the actual uses of a
computer, such as engineering modeling.
   Though the machines are Unix-based, IBM uses its own version of
Unix, called AIX, that is not compatible with Unix applications
programs written for other companies' machines. That means programs
must be rewritten for the IBM workstations.
   IBM has been working with software companies for some time to
develop programs for the new machines.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. plans to
reorganize under federal bankruptcy laws, but the parent company of
the junk bond pioneer has no operations and none of its
securities-related holdings are expected to survive.
   Through its subsidiaries, the group operates a broad financial
services business best known for its broker-dealer, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., which buys and sells securities such as the
high-risk, high-yield bonds dubbed ``junk.''
   Although court papers state that DBL Group intends to file a
reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws,
the company already has begun dismantling its subsidiaries by
selling assets.
   ``It's just a way of preserving a corporate asset structure,''
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said Wednesday. ``There's never
been any operations. It's just held subsidiaries and continues to
hold subsidiaries.''
   DBL Group has no payroll and its primary function is to handle
some investments, leases and properties, and to serve as a holding
company for its subsidiaries.
   In addition to the broker-dealer, subsidiaries include Drexel
Burnham Lambert Government Securities Inc., which buys and sells
Treasury securities issued at government auctions, and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Trading Corp., which trades commodities such as
metals and oils.
   The broker-dealer subsidiary is involved in businesses such as
stock and bond trading and underwriting, and merger and takeover
advising. It has a 600-member stock research and trading operation
the company is trying to transfer, possibly for free, to another
firm.
   Drexel's main U.S. offices are in New York and Los Angeles, and
it has outposts in London, Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong. Drexel
last year sold a U.S. retail brokerage network that handled stocks
and bonds for individual investors.
   The bankruptcy court filing lists total assets of $3.7 billion
and liabilities of $2.89 billion. Creditors number more than 2,000
_ more than 1,000 each for unsecured debt and common stock held by
Drexel employees.
   A list of top creditors excludes Drexel insiders. Michael
Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bond division who left
last year after being indicted by the government on racketeering
and fraud charges, is said to have more than $200 million in
claims. A Drexel spokesman said the firm does not consider him a
creditor.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III will handle the
case, lawyers involved said Wednesday.
   Individuals familiar with Drexel said the parent company manages
some illiquid investments _ which cannot be converted to cash _
such as bridge loans made to firms that have undergone leveraged
buyouts.
   The parent also handles real estate leases and properties for
some subsidiaries, including Drexel's downtown Manhattan
headquarters. Court papers show the parent has more than $800
million in lease obligations.
   All stock in privately held Drexel was issued by the parent.
Lambert Brussels Associates Limited Partnership, which is
controlled by Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA, owns about 26 percent of
the parent. The Belgian group's managers Wednesday proposed writing
off its stake in the company.
   Employees own about 54 percent of Drexel's parent through common
stock; Milken, for instance, was required to give up his 6 percent
stake _ then estimated to be worth about $100 million _ as part of
a civil securities fraud settlement.

<HEAD>Eagle-Picher to Start Producing Batteries for Electric Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. says it is
preparing a Missouri plant to produce batteries for electric
vehicles later this year for what the company hopes will be a
growing market for the vehicles.
   ``You could say we have high hopes for it,'' John W. Painter,
president and chief operating officer of Eagle-Picher, said
Wednesday. The diversified manufacturing company has its
headquarters here.
   The plant at Joplin, Mo., would initially employ about 50 people
and possibly more later, Painter said. The 40,000-square-foot plant
will operate as part of Eagle-Picher's Joplin Electronics Division,
which makes batteries for use in toys, computers and the nation's
space program and does research of new battery products.
   The Joplin plant will make nickel-iron batteries for
electric-powered vehicles. Gas-powered vehicles use conventional
lead-acid batteries.
   The Joplin division has been working on a nickel-iron battery
since 1980 under cost-sharing contracts with the U.S. Department of
Energy, and has produced limited numbers of the batteries as
research prototypes. Eagle-Picher has spent several million dollars
on the research, Painter said.
   Eagle-Picher and a consortium of utilities supporting the
project plan to spend a combined $4 million on the Joplin plant,
Painter said. Eagle-Picher will contribute about $300,000, he said.
   Painter said he expects that electric-powered cars, which have
been experimental for years, could go into widespread production
within 15 years. They already exist in limited uses, such as
electric-powered golf carts.

<HEAD>Philip Morris Cigarette Sales Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN HAYWOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With help from the Marlboro man, an
enormous advertising budget and growing demand overseas, the No. 1
cigarette maker is selling more smokes than ever despite a
shrinking market at home.
   In many respects, the success of Philip Morris USA reflects the
scrappy tenacity of the domestic tobacco industry, which has taken
an aggressive _ some critics would say hostile and unethical _
approach to selling cigarettes and combating health groups that
want to restrict smoking.
   ``There are 55-to-60 million adults in this country who have
made the choice to smoke,'' said Steve Weiss, a Philip Morris
spokesman.
   ``What's frightening is that these anti-smoking groups are
attempting to impose their own morality on the adult American
public by trying to control the information they receive.''
   Philip Morris hasn't been immune to the growing anti-smoking
movement in the United States, which has played a role in reducing
the market by about 2 percent a year.
   That shrinkage is partly why Philip Morris USA's New York-based
parent Philip Morris Cos. acquired Kraft Inc. and Miller Brewing
Co. years ago _ to protect itself by diversifying.
   Nonetheless, the tobacco arm of the conglomerate has been
strengthening relative to competitors, with weapons that range from
intense advertising to lobbying in Washington to a sales assault on
virgin territory abroad.
   Nearly half the roughly $636 million in domestic cigarette
advertising in 1989 was spent by Philip Morris, the trade newspaper
Advertising Age has reported.
   Philip Morris held almost 42 percent of the U.S. cigarette
market last year, said John Maxwell Jr., who follows the industry
for Wheat First Securities in Richmond. The company had a 39.3
percent market share in 1988, up from 37.8 percent the year before.
   Overseas too, Philip Morris is doing extremely well. In Japan,
for example, the company has benefited from a relaxation on imports
and a demand for the mild Virginian tobacco it uses, to be blended
with Japanese cigarettes.
   Pavlos Alexandrakis, who follows the industry for Argus
Research, an investment advisory firm in New York, predicted that
bigger and better-financed tobacco companies such as Philip Morris
will get even bigger.
   ``They can advertise more,'' Alexandrakis said. ``They can throw
more money behind product development and research.''
   By contrast, Philip Morris' closest domestic competitor, RJR
Nabisco Inc., may have little leeway in throwing money at new
products, partly because it was sold last year in a record $25
billion takeover financed largely by debt.
   The one major new cigarette RJR has attempted, primarily aimed
at blacks, generated a storm of accusations that the company was
contributing to the health problems of minorities. RJR abruptly
scrapped plans to test its Uptown brand last month in what was
widely seen as a marketing catastrophe.
   Philip Morris' brands are so self-sustaining that the company is
not as pressured to concoct new ones, analysts say. Among the best
known are Marlboro, Virginia Slims, Benson &amp; Hedges and Parliament.
Of those, Marlboro is king and is the strongest among new smokers.
   ``One out of four cigarettes smoked is Marlboro,'' Maxwell said.
``Marlboro outsells the next largest international cigarette over
two to one.''
   The range-toughened Marlboro man has been an icon of Philip
Morris ads since 1955, when it introduced the macho smoker with the
butt dangling from his lips. The company has reacted angrily to
recent efforts by anti-smoking groups to do away with him.
   The American Cancer Society, for instance, is promoting
legislation to be introduced in Congress this year that would limit
cigarette ads to the brand name, the product and text about it.
   ``People are being lured into something that kills them,'' said
Joann Schellenbach, an American Cancer Society spokeswoman in New
York. ``One in six people that start smoking are going to die from
something cigarette-related. That's worse than Russsian roulette.''
   The Surgeon General estimates that cigarettes cause an estimated
390,000 deaths a year in the United States.
   Weiss said he saw little chance that Congress would further
restrict advertising by tobacco companies, already proscribed from
peddling cigarettes on television and radio and forced to put
health warnings on other ads.
   ``There's a tremendous amount of opposition in this country to
tinkering with the commercial free speech rights of any
manufacturer,'' Weiss said.
   Perhaps more than other cigarette makers, Philip Morris has
seized upon the free speech issue as a tool to defend its business.
The company even got its name on TV with an ad campaign about its
sponsorship of a Bill of Rights commemoration, which some critics
saw as a subtle way of promoting cigarettes.
   Philip Morris has promoted cigarettes in other unconventional
ways. At the company's cigarette factory in Richmond, for example,
adult visitors are offered free cigarettes and all visitors can
write friends on Philip Morris postcards with company-paid postage.
The company also writes thank-you notes to visitors who sign the
guest register. Hazards of smoking aren't mentioned.
   Smoking critics have become increasingly galled at what they see
as the sleazy tactics used to peddle cigarettes by Philip Morris
and other companies. Many say they are particularly angered by
subtle appeals to the young.
   The tobacco industry has agreed to a code that it will not use
models under 25 to promote cigarettes. But many anti-smoking
activists say the industry subverts that code by using over-25
models who appear to be kids.
   Others complain that cigarette makers intentionally place
advertising billboards in places frequented by children.
   ``We have photographs of billboards near schoolyards and they're
really showing youthful-looking people,'' said Harold Freeman,
president of the American Cancer Society. ``Naturally, they're
appealing to young people.''
   Weiss denied Philip Morris targets young people or non-smokers.
The company participates in a program in the schools to reinforce
the fact that smoking is an adult choice, Weiss said.
   ``If you look at our advertising, you'll see that the Marlboro
ad is somebody that is in their late 30s and 40s,'' he said.

<HEAD>BP Posts 65 Percent Profit Gain In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC on Thursday reported a
65 percent jump in fourth-quarter net profit and a 44 percent gain
for 1989, aided by a rise in crude oil prices and record results in
its chemicals business.
   BP, which owns Standard Oil Co. of Cleveland, Ohio, said its net
profit for the three months ended Dec. 31 came to 448 million
pounds, or $709 million converted at an average exchange rate for
the period, compared with 272 million pounds, or $484 million, in
the same period a year ago.
   Earnings per share rose to 8.3 pence from 4.5 pence.
   The company's financial statement is based on British accounting
methods and cannot be directly compared with those of most American
companies. Inventories are valued on the basis of first in first
out (FIFO), or on a historical cost basis calculated after tax and
interest expense and before extraordinary items, instead of the
typical American system of last in first out (LIFO), or current
cost basis.
   On a current cost basis, quarterly profit rose 13.5 percent to
345 million pounds, or $546 million, from 304 million pounds, or
$541 million. Per-share earnings rose to 6.4 pence from 5 pence.
   Revenue for the three months rose 31 percent to 8.33 billion
pounds from 6.37 billion pounds.
   Higher crude prices helped exploration and production earnings
and offset lower production volumes and increased taxation, BP
said. Average per barrel North Sea brent crude prices rose to
$19.18 in the quarter from an average of $13.56 a year ago. Alaska
North Slope crude prices averaged $17.27 a barrel vs. $11.69 in the
fourth quarter of 1988, BP said.
   The rise in crude prices resulted in an inventory holding gain
of 390 million pounds for the year, compared with a 232 million
pound loss a year earlier.
   BP said its historical net profit for all of 1989 came to 1.74
billion pounds compared with 1.21 billion pounds in the previous
year. Earnings per share came to 31.8 pence compared with 20 pence.
   On a current-cost basis, net profit slipped 5.6 percent to 1.36
billion pounds from 1.44 billion pounds.
   Annual revenue gained 14.3 percent to 29.6 billion pounds from
25.9 billion pounds.
   David Simon, BP managing director, said the oil company began
repositioning itself in 1989 to become more profitable and
competitive in the future. It refocused on its core businesses and
completed a major restructuring early this year that included the
sale of exploration and production assets for $1.3 billion.
   The company also moved to improve its worldwide retailing image
during the year, Simon said.
   ``In BP Oil, we started a major program to re-image our
worldwide retail network, putting all service stations under the
single BP brand,'' Simon said.
   ``...We also launched in 1989 a major review of our corporate
working practices and systems.''
   Separately, British Petroleum's board Thursday confirmed Robert
Horton as chairman of the company effective March 11. The
appointment had been announced last year.

   Federal regulators let the parent company of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. slide into bankruptcy reorganization in
part because they felt they didn't have to save it.
   While federal banking and securities watchdogs closely monitored
Drexel's woes, ultimately they decided the collapse of one of the
nation's largest investment banking houses posed little or no
danger to the financial markets and banking system.
   ``I don't think there was any movement to do something,'' said
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, which insures bank deposits and acts as the nation's
top banking regulator.
   ``I think there was a general sense that we ought to monitor it
carefully. But there was no great push to do something once it was
found the bond-trading unit and the broker-dealer unit were
solvent,'' Seidman said Wednesday.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, the parent of the securities
subsidiaries, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy code protection from
creditors Tuesday night after defaulting on $100 million in
short-term loans.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates the
stock and bond markets, noted that while it oversees the Drexel's
broker-dealer arm, it had no legal mandate to assist the parent
company.
   ``The holding company, which is not regulated by us, is what
filed for Chapter 11,'' said an SEC spokeswoman, Mary McCue.
   The SEC today postponed a scheduled public meeting on potential
rules changes because of Drexel. ``We're contiuing to monitor the
Drexel situation closely, but there is no emergency. We think it's
prudent (to postpone the meeting),'' an SEC spokeswoman said.
   Drexel previously sold off its retail brokerage business and
``in this situation there doesn't appear to be much consumer
involvement,'' said Seidman.
   He acknowledged that the nation's savings and loans hold about
$8 billion in junk bonds _ a Drexel speciality. If Drexel's woes
drive down the already ailing market in junk bonds, Seidman said,
``that will make S&amp;Ls that hold them insolvent quicker'' and force
regulators to take the thrifts over sooner.
   The SEC is seeking authority from Congress to obtain information
about the financial health of the holding companies of
broker-dealers _ information currently denied the agency.
   Bills that would give the SEC such authority are pending in both
the House and Senate and have the support of the Treasury
Department.
   ``The continuing problems in the junk bond market point to the
need for more complete disclosure and reliable asset valuation,''
Sen. Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, said in a statement issued by
his office.
   Congress is not in session this week, but several staff aides to
key committees pointed out that unlike the savings and loan
industry _ the target of a massive taxpayer-financed bailout _
securities firms are not federally insured to guarantee investors'
losses.
   The staffers also noted that unlike Drexel, there was a
political impetus to rescue individual corporations like Chrysler
Corp. and Lockheed Corp. because of the tens of thousands of people
across the country their collapse would have thrown out of work.
   Drexel's downfall marked the largest securities industry
bankruptcy filing ever and one of the first exceptions to a
long-held regulatory policy that some financial institutions are
too big to be allowed to fail. That thinking was behind the
government rescue of Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co.
   ``There's been a too-big-to-fail doctrine that has included
Chrysler, Lockheed and other industrial units plus some banks.
There has always been discussion about how broad it is and when it
will be applied,'' said Seidman.
   ``Clearly in this case the judgment was the failure would not
imperil the system,'' he said, calling the health of Drexel's
federally regulated units ``a key factor.''
   Broker-dealers are required by the SEC to maintain enough
capital to offset the risk of the securities they trade in.
Drexel's subsidiaries that trade in stocks and bonds, offer merger
advice and buy federal bonds from the U.S. government had adequate
capital even though the parent company, DBL Group, couldn't obtain
loans to staunch a cash crisis.
   The SEC's refusal to allow the transfer of excess capital to the
parent company from the broker-dealer unit helped trigger the
bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Campbell Reports Record Second Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co., which has been torn by
bickering among descendents of its founders, reported record
second-quarter income and sales Thursday.
   Net earnings for the thre months ended Jan. 28 rose 11 percent
to $105.2 million, or 81 cents per share, compared to $94.9
million, or 73 cents per share, during the corresponding quarter a
year earlier. Net sales for the quarter rose 9 percent to $1.72
billion from $1.58 billion.
   ``A good total company earnings momentum has continued through
the second quarter,'' David W. Johnson, Campbell's president and
chief executive officer said in a statement released by the Camden,
N.J.-based firm.
   Campbell also reported a 15 percent increase in six month
earnings to $188.2 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $164.2
million, or $1.27 per share, last year. Net sales for the period
increased 11 percent to $3.25 billion, compared with $2.92 billion
last year.
   The company's largest division, Campbell U.S.A., had second
quarter earnings of $150 million, compared to $125.3 million during
the same period a year ago. Division sales rose 8 percent to $1,027
million, compared to $953.1 million last year.
   Campbell International continued its sluggish performance,
reporting a 3 percent increase in earnings to $24.3 million,
compared to $23.7 million last years. Sales, boosted by
acquisitions, increased 14 percent to $461.5 million, compared to
$403.7 million the previous year.
   Campbell has been the target of speculation in recent months
that the food-products company would be sold in the wake of a
growing rift in the company's founding family. Some relatives of
Campbell's late chairman John T. Dorrance Jr. said they were
putting their 17 percent stake in the business up for sale and
planned to push for the sale of the entire company.
   The company's board of directors said last month it would
maintain Campbell's independence.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices were slightly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
strength in the European market for soybean meal. Grain futures
were narrowly mixed.
   Analysts said about 60,000 metric tons of soybean meal changed
hands in Rotterdam, Netherlands, today at higher prices than in
recent days.
   Wheat for near-term delivery was up amid expectations that China
will tender soon for up to half of the 1 million metric tons of
subsidized U.S. wheat offered to it last week by the Agriculture
Department.
   But new-crop wheat and corn contracts were lower, pressured by
selling linked to a winter storm that has spread beneficial
precipitation across croplands from the Great Plains to the Midwest.
   ``The weather is bearish,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader
with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. ``They had a lot of rain
and snow in the Midwest.''
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2{ cents lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.88\ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to \ cent lower with March at $2.43 a bushel;
oats were { cent to } cent lower with March at $1.40\ a bushel;
soybeans were } cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $5.67} a

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the

   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .13 cent higher with
February unchanged at 79.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .17

   The stock market moved higher today and activity
picked up as wary investors returned from the sidelines.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 8.11 points at
2,632.43 by noon on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 691 issues up, 557
down and 516 unchanged.
   After stalling in the previous two sessions, trading began
picking up steam today.
   Market participants continued to monitor the unfolding of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s liquidation. The firm, whose parent sought
bankruptcy court protection earlier this week, is in the process of
transferring many of its businesses to other Wall Street firms.
   Because the process appears to be orderly, analysts said
investors who had been on the sidelines began returning to the
market.
   ``They're getting their courage back,'' said Michael Metz, a
vice president at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``There's a creaping back into
the arena by those who have been underinvested in equities.''
   Metz said the market was mildly encouraged by an upbeat Commerce
Department report showing a 29.6 percent jump in housing starts
during an exceptionally warm January. ``It's raised hopes that we
will have a fairly good economy this year,'' he said.
   Separately, traders are looking ahead to Friday's release of
merchandise trade figures for December. The consensus is that the
trade deficit will have narrowed considerably, to around $9
billion, when compared with the previous month.
   Among blue chip issues, Reader's Digest, which just went public,
headed the most-actives list and was trading at 22{ a share;
Conrail, which has completed a share buyback, fell 2} to 46}, and
IBM was up &rsqb; at 104&lsqb;. The company, as expected, introduced a new

   J.C. Penney fell 1&lsqb; to 67&rsqb; after reporting lower fourth-quarter
profits. Some banking issues showed strong gains, including
BankAmerica, up 1\ at 28\ and Manufacturers Hanover, up 1&lsqb; at 32~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.38 to 183.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

<HEAD>Penney Earnings Off Because of Prior Gain From Headquarters Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourth-quarter profit at retailer J.C. Penney Co.
Inc. fell 15.7 percent, mainly because the sale of its New York
headquarters had inflated 1988 earnings, the company reported
Thursday.
   Net income in the 13 weeks ended Jan. 27 was $367 million, or
$2.95 per share, on revenue of $5.34 billion, compared with $435
million, or $3.19 per share, on revenue of $4.95 billion in the
comparable quarter a year earlier.
   The previous year's quarter included a $139 million gain, or
$1.06 per share, from the sale of Penney's former New York
headquarters as a result of its decision to move to Texas. The
company currently is based in temporary offices while a new
headquarters is built in the Dallas suburb of Plano.
   Retail sales from the company's stores and catalog operations
increased 8.8 percent during the period, to $5.26 billion from
$4.84 billion. Other revenue fell 27.3 percent to $81 million from
$112 million, reflecting Penney's withdrawal from the casualty
insurance business.
   For the 52 weeks ended Jan. 27, Penney's net income was $802
million, or $5.86 per share, on total revenue of $16.41 million,
compared with $807 million, or $5.92 per share, on $15.3 million in
the prior year.
   The most recent period included a $20 million loss, or 16 cents
per share, from the discontinuation of Telaction, an interactive
television shopping venture. The earlier period also included the
profit from the headquarters' sale.
   Retail sales for the year were up 8.6 percent from $14.3 billion
to $16.1 billion. Other revenue dropped 34.9 percent, to $302
million from $463 million. The company said its margin also
decreased during the quarter and the year because of increased
promotional activity. Margins had improved in the previous year,
Penney said, because its lower inventory had resulted in lower
markdowns.
   ``During the 1980s, our repositioning efforts had been physical
and directional,'' said Chairman William R. Howell. ``We
reallocated our floor space in stores and focused on how our target
consumers wanted to be served.''
   ``During the 1990s, we will accelerate our efforts toward
enhancing our fashion credibility,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bank of England Steps in to Avert Liquidity Problems at Drexel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of England on Thursday outlined a special
settlements procedure to ease payments on foreign exchange dealings
involving Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s British unit.
   The British central bank said that Drexel's trading clients may
make all payments due to Drexel up through Thursday to the Bank of
England. The bank said it would hold the money until it was
satisfied that Drexel had made counter payments to clients.
   This arrangement is a stop-gap measure to avoid liquidity
problems stemming from market reaction to Drexel's bankruptcy
filing in the United States on Tuesday.
   On Wednesday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Ltd. arranged with
the Bank of England to allow it to delay settlements on its foreign
exchange and gold trading for one day.
   The move by the bank wasn't a direct effort to prop up Drexel's
operations but merely to ensure that Drexel's dealings were matched
up.
   However, the bank's involvement should calm nerves in the
markets resulting from uncertainty surrounding Drexel.
   The Bank of England said it would hold payments from Drexel's
clients until 1600 GMT next Tuesday, awaiting counter-payment from
Drexel.
   If Drexel fails to make the payments, the bank will return the
funds to the initial party, it said.
   The bank said it might extend the holding period if required by
individual circumstances.
   The bank said it wouldn't get involved in any claims brought
against Drexel.

<TEXT>
   Truck-builder Navistar International Corp. today
reported a loss of $18 million in the first quarter of its new
fiscal year and attributed the red ink to lower demand for its
products and higher production costs.
   Navistar said the net loss for the three months ended Jan. 31
amounted to 10 cents a share, compared with net income of $37
million, or 12 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.
   Revenue for the period totaled $886 million, a 12 percent
decline from the $1 billion reported for the first quarter of
fiscal 1989.
   Chairman James C. Cotting said Navistar's results suffered
mainly from a slowdown in demand for medium and heavy trucks and
engines for such vehicles.
   He also cited higher costs for labor and materials.
   Navistar, the nation's largest maker of medium and heavy trucks,
said shipments of such vehicles by all North American manufacturers
fell 21 percent during the first fiscal quarter, to 66,000 units
from 84,000 a year earlier.

   The World Bank announced on Thursday that it

interest, in the United States, Europe and for the first time in
Japan.
   The seven-year bonds are being sold at par.
   Proceeds from the sale will be lent out to Third World
countries, for which the World Bank is the biggest source of aid
loans. It is owned by 151 governments, including the United States
and Japan.
   This is the bank's second global bond issue of this size. The
first, last September, was not sold directly on the Japanese
market. The bonds were traded among Japanese customers immediately
afterwards, however.
   Sheldon Rappaport, a spokesman for the bank, said that this time
Japanese authorities made concessions to the bank that allowed the
bonds to be sold directly to the Japanese market.
   They were offered by a syndicate with 15 major sponsors, led by
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc. IBJ International
Limited and Nomura Securities were designated as co-lead managers.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. earnings fell by 50 percent
and Ford Motor Co.'s profit tumbled by 72.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, the nation's biggest automakers reported today in results
that reflect their industry's recession.
   GM, the nation's biggest corporation, posted a profit of $700.2
million, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with earnings
of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 1988. GM's
fourth-quarter earnings tumbled to $1.01 per share of common stock,
compared with $2.12 the year before.
   Earlier, Ford posted a profit of $314 million, or 68 cents a
share, during the fourth quarter compared with $1.16 billion, or
$2.42 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Ford earnings declined largely because of a $424 million loss
linked to the sale of its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary, but even
without that factor Ford's fourth-quarter earnings were down 36.3
percent.
   Together with Chrysler Corp., which Tuesday reported a
$664-million loss during the fourth quarter, the nation's Big Three
automakers made $370.2 million in the period, down 87.7 percent
from the $3 billion the companies reported in profits in 1988.
   The earnings reflect the slump the auto industry entered in
October, as the 1990 model year opened, and the costs of incentives
the automakers used to try to spur sales.
   Automakers have closed plants and laid off thousands of workers
as they cut production to bring it more in line with slow sales.
   The industry began a rebound in January, but that mainly came
about because of incentives, which cut directly into profits.
   GM's fourth quarter earnings came on revenue of $27.7 billion
during the 1989 period, compared with $28.85 billion in revenue a
year before.
   Ford's revenue in its automotive and financial services business
for the quarter amounted to $24.15 billion, compared with $23.91
billion in 1988. Its automotive revenue fell 4 percent while
financial services revenue rose 40.2 percent.
   GM's profits in its North American automotive operations slumped
during the period, but the company did not immediately provide
figures.
   For all of last year, GM's profits fell 13.1 percent to $4.22
billion, on revenue of $112.53 billion, compared with a profit of
$4.86 billion on revenue of $110.23 billion in 1988. Annual
per-share earnings dropped to $6.33 from $7.17. The year-end
figures represent the first time since 1985 that GM outearned No. 2
Ford.
   GM's major subsidiaries reported earnings Wednesday. General
Motors Acceptance Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. reported
declines, but Electronic Data Systems Corp. said its profit grew
with added data-services customers.
   For the entire year, Ford's earnings fell 27.6 percent to $3.84
billion, or $8.22 a share, from $5.3 billion, or $10.96 a share,
during 1988. In the United States, the company's profits for 1989
were down 56 percent, indicating that hourly workers will receive
sharply lower profit-sharing checks this spring than the average of
$2,800 each received last year.
   The company reported year-end revenue of $96.15 billion,
compared with $92.45 billion the year before.
   Overseas earnings, which have bolstered Ford's worldwide profit
for years, fell 3 percent in 1989 to $2.1 billion, mainly because
of increased new-product development costs.
   On Tuesday, No. 3 Chrysler Corp. reported a fourth-quarter loss
of $664 million, largely because of a one-time, $577-million charge
for two plant closings and the costs of trimming its salaried work
force by 2,300 jobs, or 8 percent.
   That compared with a $433-million profit during the
fourth-quarter of 1988.
   For the entire year, Chrysler posted a $359 million profit,
including the $577-million charge in the fourth-quarter and a
one-time, $309-million profit in the third quarter from sale of
stock in Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   On Dec. 15, Ford sold its Rouge Steel operation to Marico
Acquisition Corp., a company formed solely to buy the financially
troubled steelmaker.
   That and Ford's announcement last month that its Ford Aerospace
Corp. would be sold indicated the company was moving away from
non-automotive businesses and back to cars and financial services.

<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., battling a
$3.8 billion bid by Georgia-Pacific Corp., suffered another setback
today as a federal judge rejected its motion to block the hostile
offer.
   U.S. District Judge Gene Carter rejected Great Northern's
arguments, made in a hearing Monday, that its suitor and rival
paper manufacturer should be stopped for violating federal
securities laws. Great Northern had accused Georgia-Pacific of
concealing plans to sell Maine mills and woodlands if its bid
succeeded.
   The ruling came as Great Northern looked for a friendly buyer in
what Georgia-Pacific called a last-ditch effort to resist its offer.
   Great Northern said Wednesday its investment banker, Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., had received inquiries from companies but the firm
would not say how many comapnies or identify any of them.
   Great Northern said it had directed Goldman Sachs to seek bids
higher than Georgia-Pacific's tender offer of $63 a share.
   Earlier Wednesday, Georgia-Pacific returned to federal court to
ensure it was included in the bidding.
   Although Great Northern would not identify any of its potential
buyers, one New York securities analyst said the only other
domestic paper companies that would probably be capable of entering
the bidding were Weyerhaeuser Co., based in Tacoma, Wash., and
International Paper Co., based in Purchase, N.Y.
   ``What I don't know is if there are other companies domestically
who might be willing to diversify into the paper business,'' said
Sherman Chao of Salomon Brothers Inc.
   However, he added, ``The probability is high that G-P will
prevail.''
   A Weyerhaeuser spokesman had no comment on Great Northern. A
spokesman for International Paper said he did not believe his firm
has any interest in Great Northern, but even if it did, it would
not comment on any merger talks.
   When Great Northern announced Tuesday night that it would seek
other buyers, it also said it was postponing until March 20 a
previously scheduled March 2 meeting at which its shareholders were
to consider a Georgia-Pacific proposal to oust the Great Northern
board of directors and install candidates nominated by
Georgia-Pacific.
   Georgia-Pacific filed papers in U.S. District Court Wednesday
accusing Great Northern of violating Maine corporate law through
``last-ditch efforts to manipulate GNN's own corporate machinery
for the benefit of the company's self-interested management and
directors.''
   Georgia-Pacific asked Carter to restore the March 2 meeting and
oversee and supervise the auction for Great Northern.
   Great Northern also said it had amended its bylaws so that in
the event Georgia-Pacific's candidates ended up controlling the
board, they still would be forced to use Great Northern's ``poison
pill'' defense against hostile takeovers. A poison pill drives up
the cost of a hostile bid by allowing Great Northern to issue extra
stock at a discount.
   ``There can be no doubt that GNN's attempt to restrict the power
of future directors is in blatant violation of Maine statutes, and
well-established principles of corporate law,'' Georgia-Pacific
said.
   Great Northern vowed to contest Georgia-Pacific's challenge.

   Whittle Communications said today that more than
2,500 schools have signed up for its commercially sponsored Channel
One news program for the classroom, which is scheduled to debut
nationally on March 5.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Knoxville, Tenn.-based media
company, also said the company has sold $200 million in advertising
for the first three years of the program, including about $65
million for the first year. That amounts to about two-thirds of the
revenue that the company hopes to earn from ad sales.
   At a news conference, Whittle said the daily show will be seen
in 400 schools with 300,000 students on the launch date and that
1,000 schools should be showing it by the end of March.
   Whittle said the number of schools will rise each week as the
company installs television monitors and other equipment in the
schools. He said was confident of reaching his goal of signing
7,000 to 8,000 schools with six million students by December.
   Whittle, who was joined by former U.S. education secretary T.H.
Bell, who heads a committee of educators advising Channel One, and
others, said the service was ``the most significant educational
idea that is going on right now.''
   He said his company had awarded a $900,000 grant to the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and the firm
Interwest Applied Research to study Channel One's ``contribiution
to education over the next three years.''
   And Whittle struck back at critics who say commercial-free
programming being made available by the cable TV industry is more
suitable for use in the classroom, saying a recent poll his company
commissioned indicated few students are being exposed to the cable
programming. He blamed lack of equipment, and said the Channel One
system alone addresses that issue.
   Channel One has generated considerable controversy because it
would include two minutes of commercials within each 12-minute
daily news program. Critics have said it is wrong to allow
advertisers to pitch their products in ads to a captive audience of
teenagers in the classroom.
   Whittle has argued that teens are exposed to plenty of
commercial messages every day and that the ads were a fair price to
pay for getting the news show plus the Whittle-provided television
monitors and other equipment needed to show the program.
   State education officials in California and New York have banned
Channel One from their public schools.
   The state Board of Education in North Carolina recently
prohibited schools there from signing up for the program, saying in
part that it forces students to watch commercial advertising. That
decision will not invalidate contracts that about 100 schools in
the state already have signed to get Channel One, provided the show
does not infringe on the 5{-hour school day, but the contracts
cannot be renewed when they expire.
   Channel One had originally set a goal of being in 1,000 schools
at the launch date, and announced in November that 1,050 schools
had signed up.
   Equipment installation reportedly began in January.
   In September, Whittle announced it had signed contracts for $51
million in advertising for the first year of the service, more than
half of its first-year goal of $90 million in ad revenue.
   Cynthia Kalish Samuels, a former planning producer for NBC's
``Today Show'' was named executive producer of the Channel One
staff in October. Winter said she has assembled a news staff which
has begun producing stories.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never mind that cigars have become
passe in America's board rooms and the tobacco industry is under
siege. Bill Finck isn't about to snuff out the family business.
   His grandfather, Henry William Finck, started Finck Cigar Co. in
1893 with $1,000 he borrowed against a life insurance policy,
establishing a hand-rolling cigar operation in part of an old house.
   Automation wasn't added until 1963. ``My father didn't like
machines,'' Finck, 59, explained as he puffed a Travis Club cigar
while walking between clanging machines and shoulder-high tobacco
crates at the company's downtown San Antonio plant.
   Today, the company runs the only automated cigar factory in
Texas or any of 19 other Midwest or Southwest states, the Institute
of Texan Cultures says.
   The factory employs 76 workers who sort tobacco, operate cigar
wrapper-cutting and filler-packing machines and oversee cardboard
box packaging.
   ``It used to be that every big town had its own cigar factory,''
Finck said. ``I guess there was just too much competition for a lot
of the little guys.''
   The dozen members of the Cigar Association of America account
for about 90 percent of the 2.5 billion cigars produced in the
country each year.
   Although Finck Cigar Co. is not in that elite group, the Fincks
don't consider themselves small. The company produces millions of
cigars a year, but Finck declined to reveal the exact number or
disclose other financial details.
   ``I don't tell,'' he said. ``We've got to have a little aura of
mystery surrounding us.''
   Most Finck employees are women _ a cigar factory tradition
because female hands are said to be more delicate with the
meticulous work. Some have devoted their lives to the factory.
   Liberata Fernandez has spent 73 of her 86 years working for the
Fincks. Fellow worker Rafaela Sanchez has 72 years of service.
   ``I like everybody around here,'' Ms. Fernandez said. ``It's
easy for me.''
   Finck credits the tobacco blends and techniques the company has
developed throughout the years with keeping its reputation rolling.
   ``I guess my grandfather knew what he was doing,'' Finck said.
``Nobody can do the combinations that we do.''
   The Travis Club brand, marketed regionally, includes 14 types of
cigars varying in size, quality and cost.
   Travis Club Senators are perhaps the most popular, while Travis
Club Churchills _ thick 7-inchers _ are among the highest quality,
Finck said.
   The Fincks also are concentrating on a mail order business and
producing cigar combinations requested by other companies.
   Finck Cigar Co. buys a variety of tobacco for creating the
blends that go into its products. The huge, brown tobacco leaves
are shipped in from such faraway places as Brazil, Honduras and the
Dominican Republic as well as from the states of Connecticut,
Virginia and North Carolina.
   Finck has his own quality control methods.
   The most important element is uniformity, and the best test is
to simply look at the tobacco, he said. But Finck also likes to
burn a spot with his cigar in a tobacco leaf to check the color of
the ash.
   Finck's penchant for the tobacco business has influenced his
27-year-old son, Billy, a Texas A&amp;M University graduate who helps
run the cigar company and also enjoys puffing a stogie while
roaming the factory. Some of Finck's other children also have
worked there.
   ``I let all of them come and learn how to lay cigar wrappers,''
he said. ``I think it's good for them. They didn't like it too
much.''
   Finck himself got involved with the cigar business as a child,
and even started chomping on a butt at a young age. ``I smoked the
first one in front of my parents when I was 8 _ they thought it was
cute.''
   Though the cigar company occupies much of his time, Finck also
has been involved in ranching and is a lawyer. He keeps a set of
law books in his cigar factory office and does legal work related
to investor-owned water utilities.
   Long known as a political maverick, Finck served in the Texas
Legislature from 1967 to 1972 and became chairman of the powerful
House Appropriations Committee. When redistricting took effect in
1972, Finck lost his office in a Democratic runoff.
   That didn't keep him out of politics. He later ran for county
treasurer with the promise of abolishing the office. He won. He
kept the promise, setting fire to one of his paychecks with _ what
else _ a cigar.
   ``Politics and making cigars kind of blend together,'' Finck
said.

<TEXT>
   Reebok International Ltd. said Thursday
it had combined its domestic and international Reebok divisions,
and the president of the U.S. operation announced his resignation.
   Frank O'Connell, who was president of the U.S. division the past
two years, said he was departing the athletic-shoe company ``with
positive feelings.''
   ``It was a situation where I didn't see the opportunity to
exercise my leadership skills,'' O'Connell, 46, said in a phone
interview. ``I don't want to stay unless I could really run it.''
   Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer of Reebok,
said in a statement that John Duerden will be president of the
combined, global business.
   Duerden, 49, was previously president of the international
division.
   Combining the two divisions ``is the most effective way to
maximize the global opportunities for the Reebok brand,'' Fireman
said, adding that Duerden's experience will help the company focus
on worldwide sales.
   Under the new structure, Duerden will report directly to
Fireman, as will the presidents of other company divisions, such as
Avia and Rockport shoes and Boston Whaler boats.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout with closing quotes.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices finished higher on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday, after late afternoon international buying perked
up the market.
   Trading got off to a gloomy start in the wake of Wednesday's
1-point hike in Abbey National PLC's basic mortgage rate to 15.4
percent, above Britain's 15 percent base lending rate.
   But later in the session, investors were relieved that West
German monetary authorities decided to leave key interest rates
unchanged.
   Robust demand for international blue-chip stocks from U.S.
investors drove the market still higher, dealers said.
   By the end of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 11.72 points at 2,636.04, helping to boost the London market.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
15.5 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,313.8.
   The Financial Times 30-share iike the thousands of others who toiled
for the dreaded STB, the
Czech acronym for the now disbanded secret police, Zak is under
orders to stay home while an Interior Ministry commission mulls his
fate.
   In keeping with the philosophy of love and dignity preached by
President Havel, it's a mild punishment for years of repression Zak
helped carry out under the Communist government.
   The routine leaves Zak and countless other former functionaries
across Eastern Europe hours to ponder the fate that has wrenched
power from their hands.
   A year ago the burly, balding Zak confidently rasped out
testimony that sent Havel to jail for four months on charges of
obstructing a police official. In an interview with The Associated
Press, Zak seemed deflated.
   Seated in his neat apartment in a shabby block on the outskirts
of Prague, he groped to describe the change that has torn him from
the 20 years of intelligence work he clearly relished.
   ``It was a bit of a shock,'' he finally conceded during an
hour-long interview.
   When unrest broke out after the Nov. 17 police attack on
peaceful students, ``some official structures did not act at all,
some went beyond their authority _ and the result was what
happened,'' he said.
   As head of a 30-member department dealing with what he calls
``extremism in independent initiatives,'' Zak was among those who
best knew Havel, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and an array of
other dissidents catapulted by revolution into positions of power.
   In his classic Bolshevik ``we lost-they won'' view, this
transformation was less surprising for Zak than for a startled
world watching Czechoslovakia's rapid makeover.
   He had long gathered information by interrogating the
dissidents, listening to informers _ who he insists were unpaid _
and conducting surveillance easily observed by every visitor to
dissidents' homes.
   Zak claimed the dissidents long ago drew up a ``schedule'' of
events for 1989 that foresaw the eventual assumption of power. And
he's sure things wouldn't have happened so fast without ``certain
international support'' for his opponents.
   There were a few mistakes on the Communists' side, too, he
admitted. One was a failure publicly to acknowledge, or perhaps
even play upon, differences between the various dissident groups;
another was that ``we were forced more and more to carry out
preventive measures, and not our own intelligence work.''
   It was during these ``preventive measures'' _ the only term Zak
used to describe detention or interrogation _ that he spent hours
in discussion with Havel, Dienstbier and others, puffing on
``Petra'' cigarettes, the cheap brand smoked by all three men.
   ``If they had something constructive to say, or something I
didn't know before, I was ready to accept, or tolerate it,'' Zak
said.
   Why then was no public action taken to open dialogue with the
dissidents? ``Ask the politicians,'' Zak replied.
   Zak believes the Communists should and will play a significant
role in Czechoslovakia. He refused to talk about differences among
the former leaders over what to do about the dissidents, saying
only that four groups fought for control.
   Equally loyally, he refused to criticize the decision on Jan.
16, 1989 to arrest Havel. Zak was one of those who detained the
playwright after a small demonstration on Wenceslas Square, which
Havel observed without taking part.
   The arrest finally drove thousands of intellectuals who had
refused to side openly with the dissidents into signing petitions
for Havel's release.
   It was the start of a revolt that moved with furious pace after
Nov. 17.
   Many former Communist functionaries have found th changes
unbearable.
   At least six people closely associated with the old rulers,
including two policemen and former Slovak Communist leader Viliam
Salgovic, long reputed to be a KGB agent, have committed suicide
since the revolution.
   Scattered reports in state media indicate many Communists are
being fired and finding it hard to get work at even the most menial
tasks.
   Zak said his children met some resentment at school ``when they
refused to join in certain actions'' of protest of the authorities.
   ``And I suppose,'' he said, ``I was also punished by what is
happening to me.''

   The stock market moved higher and the pace of
trading quickened today, but investor enthusiasm for equities was
restrained.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 15.09 points at
2,639.41 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 824 issues up, 558
down and 501 unchanged.
   Trading was stalled earlier in the week, but the market seemed
to pick up some steam today.
   Market participants casually monitored the unfolding of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s liquidation. The firm, whose parent sought
bankruptcy court proteciton, is in the process of transferring many
of its businesses to other Wall Street firms.
   Because the process appeared to be orderly, analysts said
investors who had been on the sidelines began returning to the
market.
   ``The market has held up well in the face of adversity,'' said
Tom Walsh, a vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in reference to Drexel. But he noted that traders are looking
for a better indication of the nation's economic health, which
should come Friday when the government releases merchandise trade
figures for December.
   ``I do not see major commitments from investors until a clear
economic picture emerges,'' Walsh said.
   The consensus is that the trade deficit will have narrowed
considerably, to around $9 billion, when compared with the previous
month.
   Meanwhile, stocks continued to fluctuate in a relatively narrow
range. ``They seem to be drifting to the higher end of that range,
but without any clear direction,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader
with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Among blue chip issues, Reader's Digest, which just went public,
headed the most-actives list and was trading at 22&lsqb; a share;
Conrail, whose share buyback was oversubscribed, fell 2{ to 47, and
IBM, which introduced a new family of workstations, was up | at
104&rsqb;.
   Several banking issues jumped higher, including BankAmerica, up
1| at 28|, Citicorp, up 1&lsqb; at 24| and Chase Manhattan, up 1\ at 28}.
   In the auto sector, General Motors was up 1\ at 44\ and Ford
rose | to 45\. Both automakers reported sharply lower
fourth-quarter profits, but the numbers were in line with
expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.92 to 184.13. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.57 at 359.35.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 116.03 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>Americans Threaten Trade Sanctions Over Egypt's Video Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbary pirates once lurked along Egypt's
coast to plunder Mediterranean shipping. Their modern-day
counterparts lurk in Egyptian video stores, plundering U.S.
copyrights.
   Videocassette piracy has gotten so bad in Egypt that the United
States has warned it will respond with trade sanctions unless the
violations stop by April.
   Egypt is among a few U.S. trading partners like Taiwan, South
Korea and Thailand that, because of video piracy, risk retaliation
under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.
   Egyptians in the purloined video trade said the Americans are
concerned particularly about Egypt because of its history as a
cultural trend-setter for the Arabs.
   In Egyptian video shops, ``every U.S. film is pirated,'' said
Walid Nasser, an anti-piracy official of the Motion Picture Export
Association of America who has a special office in Egypt.
   Some video dealers said the high cost of going legal could put
them out of business. But that is no justification for piracy in
the view of U.S. Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, who recently warned
that the problem has become an important issue on the Egyptian-U.S.
agenda.
   Wisner said by 1986, video piracy already was costing the U.S.
film industry $23 million a year in Egypt, where the business began
in the early 1980s.
   Cairo's video shops and small rental clubs are crammed with
Grade B American movies with titles ranging from ``Magnificent
Warriors'' to ``Fists of Steel,'' favorites in working-class and
rural areas.
   But more exclusive video rental shops, like those in the city's
swank ``sporting clubs'' frequented by expatriates and the Egyptian
elite, offer tapes of the latest Hollywood films, often just
released in the United States.
   Many are of abysmal technical quality that reveal bootleg
copying, and the work of Moslem Egypt's sex-conscious film censor
is intrusive.
   But the price is attractive, generally the equivalent of $1 or
less for two nights' rental, and a censored, scratchy Batman or
Indiana Jones remains a blockbuster.
   Dealing in such pirated videos violates an international
convention on copyrights that Cairo signed in 1977. But Egypt's
laws protecting films, books and intellectual properties are
outdated and ineffectual, providing for penalties no higher than
$40 or three months in jail for repeat offenders.
   ``If fines are strong enough, and if someone is taken to court
and put in jail, he won't do it again,'' said the Motion Picture
Export Association's Nasser. ``But the law as it is has no teeth.''
   A tough proposal to amend Egypt's 1954 law on intellectual
property has been in the works for two years. It would penalize
piracy with fines of up to $4,000 and three years in prison.
   Despite U.S. pressure, the amendment has yet to be taken up by
Parliament because of other legislation that members consider more
pressing.
   Ambassador Wisner, appearing at a seminar with video-piracy
fighter Nasser, warned that Egypt risks joining at least seven
other countries on the ``priority watch list'' of governments lax
on piracy. He said Hollywood's annual worldwide losses to piracy
are estimated at about $1 billion.
   Wisner said the United States invokes trade sanctions only ``if
the situation is grave. It is very important to the United States.''
   Sanctions could mean barriers to Egyptian textiles in the U.S.
market, for example, which would be a major blow. U.S. figures show
such exports to the United States have been doubling each year
since 1986 and now total more than $120 million a year.
   Under the competitiveness act, the office of U.S. Trade
Representative Carla A. Hills must tell Congress by April what
Egypt is doing to fight video piracy, Wisner said.
   Egypt organized an Anti-Piracy Squad a decade ago, but the group
of a dozen Tax Department officers assigned to regulate 3,000 video
dealers nationwide is considered a symbol of weak enforcement.
   Its leader, Brig. Hussein Abdel-Rahman, denied Nasser's
contention that all U.S. films are pirated, but conceded that at
least 60 percent probably were. The rest are transferred legally
from 35mm film onto videotape by production companies with legally
purchased copyrights, he said.
   Moreover, only 20 percent of the 300 piracy cases filed in 1989
involved American and other foreign films, he said.
   ``We are not encouraging or neglecting piracy,'' he said.
``Unless a film producer complains to us, we don't have the means
to control every video store and club.''

<TEXT>
   IBM unveiled a line of computer workstations
Thursday that the company says outperform and underprice the
competition and should help it snare a major stake in a
fast-growing market where it never had success.
   ``The opportunity is big _ it's growing at over 30 percent a
year, and it's mostly a new opportunity for IBM,'' said President
Jack D. Kuehler.
   The machines, called the RISC System-6000, also mark the first
time that the world's largest computer maker has wholeheartedly
embraced the Unix computer operating system that is fast becoming
the industry standard.
   International Business Machines Corp. also announced its
intention to provide ways to link the new machines with IBM
computers that run on its proprietary operating system.
   An operating system is software that controls basic computer
functions, such as executing commands from the keyboard and opening
computer files.
   Kuehler told a news conference that the new machines, designed
for use by engineers, ``outperform the newest and best that our
competitors offer.''
   IBM announced four high-performance workstations and five
file-servers, which are used to link computers in a network. The
machines range in price from about $13,000 to more than $74,000.
   IBM said the lowest-price model is the most powerful desktop
workstation on the market, beating the offering of Sun Microsystems
Inc., considered the workstation leader. The IBM model performs
27.5 million instructions per second, or mips, compared with 12.5
mips for the Sun model. It also is slightly cheaper than Sun's.
   Industry analysts say the workstations are impressive for their
performance, pricing and features.
   ``From the customer standpoint, I think it's going to get IBM
into the door in ways it didn't before,'' said Peter Burris, an
analyst for International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
   Workstations are desktop or side-of-desk machines that are much
more powerful than personal computers. Some even match the power of
mainframes. They are used for such processing-intensive tasks as
three-dimensional computer modeling of new products.
   The workstation market is small, but is among the
fastest-growing computer segments, and uses for the machines are
expanding.
   ``A lot of things start in the scientific market and gravitate
out toward other markets,'' said Barry Bosak, an analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   IBM introduced a workstation line several years ago, the RT
line, but it captured less than 3 percent of market. Experts
consider the machines underpowered and overpriced.
   ``We made a mistake,'' Kuehler said in an interview.
   The workstation field is dominated by Sun, Digital Equipment
Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.
   Unix, developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., allows
machines from different manufacturers to work together. Until now,
IBM had promoted its own operating systems. Basing the workstations
on Unix shows IBM is serious about this market, Kuehler said in the
interview.
   It also is recognition of the huge library of Unix-based
software available for workstations, he said.
   The machines are based on IBM's own version of Unix, called AIX,
but are a new generation of the operating system. Analysts said the
new AIX is even more compatible with industry standards.
   Unix-based applications programs _ the software that provides
the actual uses of computers, such as word processing _ must be
rewritten for AIX.
   IBM has been working with software companies for some time to
develop programs for the new machines. By the end of the year,
about 1,500 application programs worldwide will be available, it
said.
   IBM's embrace of Unix has broad implications for the operating
standard, said Louise Rehling, a senior vice president at SPSS
Inc., a Chicago software company that was among those recruited.
   ``We think IBM is going to bring a lot of credibility to the
Unix markeplace,'' she said. ``The size of the pie will grow as
well as the IBM share.''
   Like the older IBM workstations, the new models are based on
reduced-instruction-set computing technology, or RISC, which
simplifies the circuitry of a computer's central processor to
increase speed and offer cost savings. But IBM said the RISC system
in the new machines is greatly improved.
   Shipments of the workstations will begin within 90 days, IBM
said.
   Bosak said the workstations would have little short-term impact
on IBM's earnings. But they represent an important signal that the
company is working to improve its fortunes.
   Last month, IBM reported its 1989 profit slipped 35 percent from
the year before. The company also has embarked on a cost-cutting
program that involves the elimination of thousands of jobs.

rival paper company.
   Great Northern argued in a hearing on Monday that the $63 a
share tender offer should be stopped because Georgia-Pacific
executives lied about plans to sell Great Northern's assets in
Maine if the merger goes through.
   Great Northern also asked U.S. District Judge Gene Carter to
halt Georgia-Pacific's efforts to oust the Great Northern board in
a proxy fight, saying the purported cover-up violated federal
securities laws and as a result, its suitor should not be allowed
to continue the proxy battle.
   Carter refused, saying in a 20-page ruling Great Northern had
not proved any of its charges.
   ``Not only has Great Northern failed to meet its burden of
showing that Georgia-Pacific had a plan to divest Great Northern
assets, which would make its (Securities and Exchange Commission)
filings and other public statements untrue, but there is
significant evidence suggesting that Georgia-Pacific affirmatively
decided not to develop or adopt such a plan,'' the judge wrote.
   Great Northern had not had time to study the ruling, so had no
immediate comment, spokesman Stephen M. Hill said Thursday from the
company's headquarters in Norwalk, Conn.
   Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific has steadfastly denied any plans
to sell the Great Northern mills in Millinocket and East
Millinocket or Great Northern's 2.1 million acres of the northern
Maine woods.
   But Great Northern produced various memos and notes that it
claimed showed Georgia-Pacific has been considering the acquisition
of Great Northern since at least 1984, and selling the Maine assets
were always part of its strategy.
   Georgia-Pacific accused Great Northern of forming its arguments
out of isolated snippets of information. In response to Great
Northern's charges, Georgia-Pacific produced affidavits and
depositions from 14 witnesses, including Georgia-Pacific
executives, bankers and consultants.
   All the documents disputed Great Northern's contentions about
Georgia-Pacific's plans.
   Great Northern said the testimony produced by the witnesses
could not be believed because it appeared to contradict the memos
and notes, which were written before possible sales of the Maine
assets became an issue in the state.
   Carter dismissed that argument, saying, ``since notes are by
their very nature abbreviated and sometimes cryptic, an explanation
of them is often helpful to the court in determining their
significance.''
   Carter went on to say he was ``satisfied that the affidavits
accurately reflect Georgia-Pacific's intent because all the
evidence indicates that Georgia-Pacific strongly resisted an asset
sales plan as part of the financing package.''
   Great Northern's latest defeat came two days after it announced
it had begun soliciting buyers who would offer more than
Georgia-Pacific's $63 per share.
   Securities analysts said Great Northern realized it had lost its
battle to remain independent because of a ruling from the court
last week that would make it easier for Georgia-Pacific to oust the
Great Northern directors.
   Great Northern would not comment on any of its potential buyers,
Hill said Thursday.

   The stock market moved steadily higher and the
pace of trading quickened today, but investor enthusiasm for
equities was restrained.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 14.19 points at
2,638.51 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 818 issues up, 614
down and 491 unchanged.
   Trading was stalled earlier in the week, but the market gathered
steam today.
   Market participants casually monitored the unfolding of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.'s liquidation. The firm, whose parent sought
bankruptcy court protection, is in the process of transferring many
of its businesses to other Wall Street firms.
   Because the process appeared to be orderly, analysts said
investors who had been on the sidelines began returning to the
market.
   ``The market has held up well in the face of adversity,'' said
Tom Walsh, a vice president at Nikko Securities Co. International
Inc. in reference to Drexel. But he noted that traders are looking
for clues to the nation's economic health, which should come Friday
when the government releases merchandise trade figures for December.
   ``I do not see major commitments from investors until a clear
picture emerges,'' Walsh said.
   The consensus is that the trade deficit will have narrowed
considerably, to around $9 billion, compared with November.
   Meanwhile, stocks held to a relatively narrow range. ``They seem
to be drifting to the higher end of that range, but without any
clear direction,'' said Peter Vandenberg, a trader with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   Among the most actively traded stocks, two new issues led the
list. Reader's Digest was trading at 22, up 2 from its initial
price, and Growth Fund of Spain, a mutual fund, was trading at 13{,
up 1{ from the asking price. Conrail, whose share buyback was
oversubscribed, fell 2{ to 47, and IBM, which introduced a new
family of workstations, was up { at 104\.
   Banking issues were touted by analysts, pushing the sector
higher. Gainers included including BankAmerica, up 1&rsqb; at 28&rsqb;,
Citicorp, up 1&rsqb; at 24~ and Chase Manhattan, up 1{ at 29.
   In the auto sector, General Motors was up 1&lsqb; at 44&lsqb; and Ford
rose | to 45\. Both automakers reported sharply lower
fourth-quarter profits, but the numbers were in line with
expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.90 to 184.11. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 0.51 at 359.29.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 138.57 million shares with an
hour to go.

   The British conglomerate Hanson PLC said Thursday
its U.S. arm was buying a 45 percent stake in Peabody Holding Co.
Inc., the largest coal producer in the United States, for $504
million in cash.
   Sir Gordon White, chairman of Hanson Industries, called the
purchase ``an attractive investment.''
   Hanson Industries agreed to buy the Peabody holdings of three
U.S. shareholders, Boeing Co., Bechtel Investments Inc. and energy
company Eastern Enterprises.
   U.S.-based Newmont Mining Corp. is the other major shareholder
in Peabody, with a 55 percent share.
   Hanson owns a 49 percent interest in Newmont Mining, acquired as
part of its $5.6 billion acquisition of Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC in August 1989.
   Hanson also said in a filing Thursday with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in Washington that it may offer to buy the
remaining shares in Peabody. In addition, the conglomerate said it
may seek the restructuring or recapitalization of Peabody, or seek
the sale of its stake in the company or of some of Peabody's assets.
   Peabody had pretax profit of $136.5 million on sales of $1.74
billion in 1989. After-tax profit was not available, Hanson said.
   The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and consent
from Peabody's lenders and Newmont Mining, Hanson said.

<HEAD>Gillette Reports 6 Percent Earnings Growth In 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. said Thursday its 1989 earnings grew
6 percent compared with the year before, while fourth-quarter
earnings climbed 29 percent for the world's leading razor-blade
maker.
   In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Gillette had earnings of $79.4
million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $61.5 million, or 63
cents a share, in the same quarter of 1988.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $1.05 billion, marking the first
time the company surpassed $1 billion in sales in any quarter.
Revenue for 1988's fourth quarter was $968 million.
   For all of 1989, Gillette reported net income of $284.7 million,
or $2.70 a share, on sales of $3.8 billion, compared with earnings
of $268.5 million, or $2.45 a share, on sales of $3.58 billion in
1988.
   The company said sales in its North Atlantic division, which
covers North America and Europe, were ``moderately higher'' for
1989, while the operating profit was virtually unchanged.
   Dave Fausch, a Gillette spokesman, said the profit for this
division was hurt by the performance of the company's toiletry
products. In December, the company realigned its toiletry
operations, merging them with the shaving division. Gillette also
has sold some personal care product lines in Europe.
   Fausch said Gillette is encouraged about 1990, as the company
promotes its new Sensor razor, which was introduced last month with
much fanfare. The high-tech razor, priced higher than previous
models, is designed to offer a closer shave.
   The Sensor is part of Gillette's strategy to persuade customers
to switch from disposable brands to higher-priced razors with
replaceable blades.
   Fausch said ``the trend lines are going well'' in this
initiative.

   Soybean futures prices rose modestly Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting strength in the European
market for soybean meal, while wheat futures retreated and corn
futures closed mixed.
   Soybean meal traded more actively and at higher prices Thursday
in Rotterdam than it had in several days, analysts said.
   But the rally in Chicago _ meal for March delivery rose 80 cents
to $165.90 per ton _ was weak in comparison, said Anne Frick,
senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York.
   Soybean oil futures also strengthened, though, which helped to
boost soybean prices, she said.
   Wheat and corn futures remained under pressure from a winter
storm that has brought large amounts of beneficial moisture to
croplands from the Great Plains to the Midwest.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 1} cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.86\ a bushel; corn futures
were { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with March at $2.42{ a bushel;

   Eruption of the Redoubt Volcano in Alaska fueled
energy futures prices Thursday amid concern that oil supplies could
be disrupted.
   However, activity in the petroleum pits continued even after
reports that the eruption would have only a minor impact, analysts
said.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude, jumped 77 cents
to $22.84 a barrel. Later months posted gains of 40 cents to 48
cents.
   Among refined products, wholesale unleaded gasoline for March
delivery rose 0.75 cent a gallon to 60.64 cents a gallon, April
advanced 0.92 cent to 61.64 cents, while later months had gains of
more than a penny a gallon.
   Heating oil for March surged 1.01 cents to 58.65 cents a gallon,
April rose 0.70 cent to 57.96 cents and May ended at 56.84 cents,
up 0.50 cent a gallon.
   Analysts said the markets opened on a firm note led by heating
oil, which gained strength from rising European demand at a time
many refineries are slowing down for annual maintenance checks.
   The crude market came alive on news that Redoubt Volcano located
about 115 miles southwest of Anchorage had erupted.
   ``The concern was that the eruption might impact Alaska crude
supplies,'' said Andrew Lebow, senior broker and analyst for
E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.
   However, energy brokers said the markets continued to rally in
heavy trading even after news that the volcano might have only a
minor impact on supplies around Cook Inlet but would not affect the
crucial Prudhoe Bay supplies or the Alaska pipeline.
   Traders attributed the strength in products to refinery
maintenance turnarounds in Europe that will be followed by
turnarounds in this country in March and April.

   Assets of the nation's 497 money market mutual
funds fell $374.1 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $387.11 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $2.82 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $387.48 billion in the week
ended Feb. 7.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 244 general purpose funds rose $351.5 million to $131.22
billion, assets of 101 broker-dealer funds increased $43.1 million
to $164.46 billion, and assets of 152 institutional funds declined
$768.7 million to $91.42 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.65 percent from 7.66 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.68 percent from 7.71 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.29 percent as of Wednesday from 6.30 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.07 percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.94 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.95 percent; 7.94 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.95 percent;
and 8.00 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 7.98 percent.

   The stock market came out of the doldrums
Thursday to close higher in brisk trading.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 25.23 points to
close at 2,649.55.
   Advancing issues issues outnumbered declining ones by about 11
to 7 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
stocks, with 908 up, 583 down and 469 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 174.63 million
shares, up from 138.53 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 202.31 million shares.
   The market gained ground steadily throughout the day, with
banking stocks and two new issues leading the advance.
   Traders drew confidence from the fact that the market ``survived
Drexel,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, a senior vice president at St.
Louis-based A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. He was referring to the
liquidation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose parent sought
bankruptcy court protection earlier this week.
   The firm has begun transferring many of its businesses to other
Wall Street firms, a process that appeared to be going smoothly.
   ``People now believe we can manage surprises and shocks to the
financial system,'' said Hugh Johnson, a senior vice president at
First Albany Corp.
   With that behind the market, Johnson said the focus ``shifted
toward what really matters _ economic data.''
   The government reported a 29.6 percent rise in January housing
starts and a sharp rise in housing permits, both of which were
significantly stronger than expected.
   ``They tend to dispel the notion that we're in a recession, and
the case for a recession during 1990 was ... certainly weakened,''
Johnson said.
   Still, investor enthusiasm for equities remained restrained
until a clearer picture of the economy emerges.
   ``A lot of people are looking at the market through rose-colored
glasses,'' Goldman said. ``They are ignoring the southbound trip of
bonds, higher interest rates here and abroad, and lower corporate
profits for the next few quarters.''
   The market could get a jolt Friday, when a number of stock-index
futures and options will expire and the government releases
merchandise trade figures for December.
   Heading the Big Board's most-active list were two new issues.
Growth Fund of Spain, a single-country mutual fund, finished at 13,
up 1 from its initial price, and Reader's Digest closed at 22, up 2
from its offering price. Analysts said heavy trading in these two
issues affected overall volume.
   Several analysts recommended a number of money center and
regional banks. Gainers within the sector included BankAmerica, up
1{ at 28{; Chase Manhattan, up 1} at 29\; Citicorp, up 1{ at 25;
Manufacturers Hanover, up 1&rsqb; at 33&lsqb; and J.P. Morgan, up 1&lsqb; at 37&lsqb;.
   In the auto sector, General Motors rose 1 to 44 and Ford was up
| to 45\. Both automakers reported lower profits for the final 1989
quarter, but the numbers were in line with market expectations.
   Elsewhere, Coca-Cola, which boosted its quarterly a dividend and
announced plans for a stock split, gained 2&rsqb; to 69{; IBM, which
unveiled a new family of workstations, was unchanged at 103}, and
J.C. Penney fell 2} to 65}. The retailer announced lower quarterly
profits.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market gained $25.98 billion, or 0.81
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.49 to 184.70.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index gained 3.38 to 386.51, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index advanced 2.88 to 334.89.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
3.05 to 429.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 359.60, up 0.82.

   The dollar advanced against all major currencies
except the Canadian dollar Thursday although there was little news
to guide the foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices were generally lower. Gold fell $4.30 to close at
$412.40 a troy ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $413 a
troy ounce, down $3.70.
   Analysts said the dollar rose as traders adjusted their
positions after the U.S. currency's recent losses.
   Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader with the Bank of New
York, said concerns about the bankruptcy filing by Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. earlier this week had abated.
   Ryan said there was no fundamental news to influence the market
Thursday. However, he said, the dollar could drift higher.
   Overseas dealers said traders were reluctant to buy a lot of
dollars in advance of Friday's scheduled release of U.S. trade
figures for December.
   Dealers reported the West German mark, which has soared in
response to the political changes in Eastern Europe, had lost some
confidence, but the dollar lacked substantial support to break into
any new ground against it.
   The dollar rose to 1.6935 marks in New York from 1.6750 late
Wednesday after closing at 1.6805 marks in Frankfurt, up from
1.6715.
   The British pound fell against the dollar, closing at $1.6855 in
New York, compared with $1.6960 late Wednesday. In London earlier,
sterling cost $1.6936, cheaper than Wednesday's late $1.6963.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.5075 Swiss francs, up from 1.4940;
5.7580 French francs, up from 5.6965; 1,258.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,244.75; and 1.20405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.20745.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late

from 1.8832; 1,248.00 Italian lire, up from 1,242.25; 1.2060
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2062.
   The dollar closed at 144.775 Japanese yen in New York, up from
144.35. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.45 Japanese yen,
up from 144.35. In London late Thursday the dollar closed lower at
144.38 yen.
   Gold closed in London, the major overseas market, at a bid
$415.50 a troy ounce, down from $416.25 late Wednesday. The closing
price in Zurich was $415.75 bid, up from $415.52.
   A bullion dealer in Zurich said the whole market was clouded by
anxiety over the extent of the precious metals holdings of Drexel
Burnham. Prices would be affected if Drexel, whose parent filed for
bankruptcy court protection late Tuesday, unloads its portfolio.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $416.85 bid, down from
$417.25.
   Silver rose 0.2 cent on the Commodity Exchange to $5.317 a troy
ounce. In London, silver traded at $5.35 bid for a troy ounce, up
from $5.32.

<HEAD>GM, Ford 4th-Quarter Earnings Tumble; Profit Sharing Down for Auto
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profits plunged by 50 percent at General Motors
Corp. and by 72.9 percent at Ford Motor Co. in the fourth quarter,
as the nation's biggest automakers on Thursday showed the impact of
slow sales and costly buyer incentives.
   The quarterly results completed a sharp drop in annual earnings
for the nation's Big Three automakers, which have been struggling
with an industrywide slump that has prompted plant closings and
thousands of layoffs.
   Autoworkers will get more bad news this spring: the decline in
profits at GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp., which on Tuesday posted a
$664 million net loss for the fourth quarter, will mean little or
no annual profit sharing payments this year.
   GM posted a $700.2 million profit in the three months ended Dec.
31, down from $1.4 billion in the same quarter of 1988. GM's
fourth-quarter earnings tumbled to $1.01 per share of common stock,
compared with $2.12 the year before.
   GM's total sales and revenue during the October-December
quarter, including non-automotive subsidiaries, fell to $31.36
billion from $32.43 billion a year earlier.
   Ford reported fourth-quarter profit of $314 million, or 68 cents
a share, compared with $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share, in the
year-earlier quarter. Ford's quarterly revenue in its automotive
and financial services businesses amounted to $24.15 billion,
compared with $23.91 billion in 1988.
   Ford earnings decline reflected a $424 million loss linked to
the sale of its Rouge Steel Co. subsidiary, but even without that
factor fourth-quarter earnings were down 36.3 percent.
   Industrywide, car and truck sales fell sharply when the 1990
model year began in October, mainly because of reduced buyer
incentives and higher prices for the new vehicles.
   Throughout November and December, auto companies funneled money
into incentive programs _ which comes directly out of profits _ in
an attempt to halt the slide.
   Compounding the problems, the Big Three faced swelling
inventories and prepared to lay off thousands of auto workers
during the first quarter of this year. Those layoffs largely have
been accomplished and inventories of unsold vehicles have shrunk
from a 91-selling-day level at year's end to 70 days at the end of
January.
   Ford Treasurer David McCammon said the company spent an average
of $800 in incentives for every car and truck it sold in the fourth
quarter, slightly more than double the figure for the year-earlier
quarter.
   He said that on Dec. 31, Ford was spending about $1,000 on
incentives for each of its vehicles.
   As production and inventories get more in line with demand,
McCammon said, automakers should be able to rely less on incentives
to control new-car inventory and sales.
   For the first time since 1985, GM's annual earnings outpaced
those of No. 2 Ford.
   GM's annual profit fell 13.1 percent to $4.22 billion, on total
corporate revenue of $126.93 billion, compared with a profit of
$4.86 billion on revenue of $123.64 billion in 1988. Annual
earnings per GM common share dropped to $6.33 from $7.17.
   GM's major subsidiaries reported earnings Wednesday. General
Motors Acceptance Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp. reported
declines, but Electronic Data Systems Corp. said its profit grew
with added data-services customers.
   Ford's annual earnings fell 27.6 percent to $3.84 billion, or
$8.22 a share, from $5.3 billion, or $10.96 a share, during 1988.
Annual revenue rose to $96.15 billion from $92.45 billion.
   Chrysler on Tuesday said it lost $664 million in the fourth
quarter, mainly because of a one-time $577 million charge for plant
closings and costs of cutting jobs from its white-collar work
force. Chrysler posted a profit of $433 million in fourth quarter
1988.
   Chrysler's annual profit plummeted 65.8 percent to $359 million.
   Each of the automakers said their performances in the United
States suffered last year, meaning no profit sharing for Chrysler
hourly workers, no bonuses for the company's salaried employees and
sharply lower profit-sharing payments to hourly workers at GM and
Ford.
   Last year, Chrysler handed out an average of $720 to hourly
workers, GM gave out an average of $265 per worker and Ford's
hourly employees got an average of $2,800 apiece.
   GM said Thursday afternoon it would distribute profit-sharing
checks of about $50 apiece to its 443,000 U.S. salaried and hourly
employees.
   Ford said it would make a profit-sharing announcement Friday.
   United Auto Workers union Vice President Ernie Lofton, head of
the union's Ford Department, said while workers welcome profit
sharing in any amount, ``what's far more important to them and
their union is securing existing jobs and creating new union jobs
in U.S. Ford factories.''
   UAW contracts with each of the Big Three expire at midnight
Sept. 14, and union leaders have said job security will be a top
issue.

<HEAD>Gold, Platinum Futures Weaken Amid Better Economic News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold and platinum futures prices weakened Thursday amid new
signs of economic strength, including a record-breaking rise in
housing starts and a surge in stock prices.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures rose; petroleum
futures gained; coffee futures slumped; grains and soybeans were
mixed; pork bellies surged and livestock futures were mixed.
   Gold futures fell $4.30 to $5.10 an ounce on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in February
settling at $412.40 a troy ounce. Silver futures finished unchanged
to 0.3 cent higher with March at $5.33 a troy ounce.
   The platinum market gave up most of the previous session's
gains. Platinum futures settled $4 to $5 lower on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with April at $522.90 a troy ounce.
   Precious metal traders focused on a variety of bullish factors
including the government's January housing-starts report and
expectations that another government report Friday will show a
reduction in the U.S. trade deficit in December.
   Positive news about the economy is generally bearish for gold
prices since investors tend to buy gold as a hedge against an
economic downturn.
   The Commerce Department's report of a 29.6 percent increase in
January housing starts to a record seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.63 million units helped boost the dollar's value against other
major currencies, which typically prompts selling of precious
metals.
   Thursday's 25-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average
also quelled investment demand for gold, analysts said.
   Analysts also cited profit-taking ahead of the upcoming
three-day weekend, and rumors that the struggling brokerage firm
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was again liquidating positions in the
precious metal markets to raise cash.
   Despite the weakness, ``I think the platinum market is still
very steady and the gold market also appears to be in a bullish
trend,'' said Anne Orton, vice president of Deak International Inc.
   ``They just didn't seem to have much strength today,'' she said.
   The housing-starts report also lent support to copper futures on
the Commodity Exchange. Copper wire and pipes are heavily used in
home construction.
   Copper futures settled .95 cent to 1.7 cents higher with
February at $1.085 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures rose sharply on the New York Merc, partly
reflecting fears that a new eruption of Alaska's Redoubt volcano
posed a threat to the oil industry there.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents to 77 cents
higher with March at $22.84 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent to
1.01 cents higher with March at 58.65 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .75 cent to 1.3 cents higher with March at 60.64 cents
a gallon.
   Coffee futures retreated slightly on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange on news that Brazilian shipping companies and dock
workers had reached a wage agreement, averting a strike.
   Coffee settled .83 cent to 1.02 cents lower with March at 84.98
cents a pound.
   Soybean futures rose modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting strength in the European market for soybean meal, while
wheat futures retreated and corn futures closed mixed.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1 cent lower with March at
$3.86\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
March at $2.42} a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent lower with
March at $1.40{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4\ cents higher
with March at $5.71 a bushel.
   Pork belly futures surged on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on
news that the United States is exploring the possibility of
subsidizing sales of U.S. meat to the Soviet Union.
   Such a program could be modeled on the Export Enhancement
Program for grains in which the Agriculture Department provides
grain or grain credits to exporters to sell to targeted nations.
   Frozen pork belly futures settled .98 cent to 1.8 cents higher
with February at 51.10 cents a pound; live cattle futures finished
.30 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 79.77 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .18 cent higher with March at
82.02 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .32 cent lower
with February at 49.85 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Feb. 5, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,251.7 billion from $3,239.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,067.8 billion from $4,056.1 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $799.2 billion from $792.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
diference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 6.0 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.4 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,222.4 billion, a 6.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,045.1 billion, up 3.1 percent, while M1
rose 4.7 percent to an average of $793.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $473 million.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $1.036 billion a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$852 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves averaged $436
million in the two weeks ended Feb. 7, down from $575 million in
the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $299.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Feb. 7, down from $303.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Federated-Allied Say Sales Down But Stores Receiving More Goods</HEAD>

   The Federated and Allied retailing companies
are making progress luring merchandise suppliers back during the
chains' bankruptcy reorganizations, but sales have declined, their
president said Thursday.
   Sales for the 260 stores that Federated Department Stores Inc.
and Allied Stores Corp. operate in 28 states were up 3 percent in
December from the previous year, but declined 9 percent in January
and 4 percent in February, said James M. Zimmerman, president and
chief operating officer of Federated and Allied.
   ``We're going to have a very poor fourth quarter,'' Zimmerman
told reporters, referring to the fiscal quarter than ended Feb. 3.
   Zimmerman declined to be more specific. January sales figures
will be released March 5, while fiscal fourth-quarter and year-end
results are to be released May 3, company spokeswoman Carol Sanger
said.
   Under an ideal scenario, Federated and Allied could emerge from
their Chapter 11 reorganizations in eight months, said G. William
Miller, the former U.S. Treasury secretary hired Jan. 16 as
chairman and chief executive officer of Federated Stores Inc., the
newly created parent of Federated and Allied.
   The two retailers filed Jan. 15 for bankruptcy protection from
creditors, listing $7.7 billion in debts.
   Miller, addressing reporters with Zimmerman and new
Federated-Allied Chairman Allen I. Questrom, said his optimistic
projection could occur if Federated and Allied develop
reorganization plans within the 120 days they are allowed the
exclusive right to do so, and creditors and the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court give quick approval to them.
   But, Miller said, ``I don't promise you that that's possible or
even feasible.''
   He described both companies as viable and profitable, but said
they must adjust the staggering debts amassed when parent Campeau
Corp. of Toronto acquired Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   ``The capital structure is what's broke, and is what brings us
here today,'' Zimmerman said.
   The Chapter 11 filings have noticeably hurt confidence of
customers and merchandise suppliers, but Federated and Allied are
making progress and are now receiving about 85 percent of the goods
they order.
   In the weeks prior to the Jan. 15 filing, the stores were
receiving only about 25 percent of their orders, with merchants
refusing to ship the rest, Zimmerman said.
   The bankruptcy court's approval last Friday of interim financing
provided a critical boost for the two companies, Questrom said. The
court approved $700 million in debtor-in-possession financing and
$1.7 billion in funds to allow the charge-card subsidiaries of
Allied and Federated to buy charge-card accounts from the chains,
giving them a cash infusion.
   Questrom, lured away from the Neiman-Marcus chain Feb. 2 with a
five-year contract that will pay him $1.2 million annually, said
Federated and Allied face a challenge in trying to maintain market
share against financially healthy competitors.
   Questrom said he will focus on luring back more of Federated and
Allied's vendors and in adjusting merchandise inventories to keep
customers coming in.
   Zimmerman said he expects no across-the-board layoffs among the
combined 100,000 Federated and Allied employees. The companies have
suffered no major employee losses because of the Chapter 11
filings, but need to work on retaining employees, Questrom said.
   ``I think the ball is in our court to run the kind of company
where our employees want to work,'' Zimmerman said.

<HEAD>Occidental Names Successor to Armand Hammer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s 91-year-old chief,
Armand Hammer, will be replaced as chairman by company President
Ray R. Irani if Hammer retires or dies, Occidental announced
Thursday.
   The Los Angeles-based petrochemical giant said, however, that
the imperious Hammer has no immediate plans to step aside.
   The announcement said Hammer is in ``very good health''
following heart surgery in November and the death of his wife,
Frances, in December. He plans to continue as chairman and chief
executive for the indefinite future, it said.
   Irani, 55, has been widely expected to replace Hammer, who has
tried to emphasize in the past few years that Occidental would be
able to hold steady without him.
   Irani was named president and chief operating officer of
Occidental in August 1984, leaping over 14 other executive vice
presidents after just 14 months at Occidental. He replaced Hammer's
former heir-designate, A. Robert Abboud, who quit during a power
struggle after four years on the job.
   Speculators, believing Occidental to be likely a takeover target
without Hammer at its head, have repeatedly bid up its stock price
on rumors and reports of ill health, most recently following the
implantation of a heart pacemaker in Hammer's chest in November. It
edged up 87{ cents Thursday in heavy trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, to $28.25 per share.
   Hammer and Irani declined interview requests. Asked about the
timing of the announcement, Occidental spokesman Frank Ashley said,
``This action was taken to put to rest any rumors about succession
at Occidental.
   ``It was solely Dr. Hammer's suggestion to dispel any rumors,''
Ashley said, noting that Hammer, who prides himself as a private
ambassador for peace, continues his globe-trotting.
   ``He was just in the Soviet Union,'' Ashley said. ``He is
keeping a full schedule and his health is fine.''
   When Hammer attended a Republican fund-raiser Feb. 6 featuring
President George Bush, he showed up at the Century Plaza Hotel in
Los Angeles in a wheelchair. Looking frail and raising his arm to
acknowledge reporters, he was wheeled around a Secret Service metal
detector to a private reception. He didn't speak to reporters.
   Hammer said he had requested that Occidental's directors name
Irani his successor ``to provide for an orderly future management
succession.''
   During Irani's 5{ years as president, Occidental has shifted its
focus from foreign oil operations to domestic. It has grown from
revenues of $15.6 billion in 1985 to $20.1 billion in 1989, growth
Hammer attributed largely to Irani.
   Results at Occidental's chemical division, which Irani has
headed since joining the company in 1983, improved from a loss of
$38 million on sales of $1.7 billion that year to 1989 earnings of
more than $1 billion on sales of $5.2 billion.
   ``Ray Irani has clearly earned this unanimous vote of confidence
by the Occidental board,'' Hammer said in a statement.
   Irani, born in Beirut, Lebanon, has a PhD. in chemistry and
began his career as a research scientist. He came to Occidental
from Olin Corp., where he was president, joining Occidental as
chairman and chief executive of its Occidental Chemical Corp.
subsidiary.

   Federated-Allied department store executives
told creditors Thursday that the companies didn't deceive them
about the financial crisis that precipitated the biggest bankruptcy
filing in retailing history.
   But the executives said they doubted all the $7.7 billion in
debt listed in their bankruptcy filings would be fully repaid.
   Much of the debt resulted from the junk-bond-financed takeovers
of Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. last
decade by the Campeau Corp. of Canada, a real estate developer.
   G. William Miller, chairman of the newly formed parent company
Federated Stores Inc., and the top executives of the two retailers,
which operate 260 stores in 28 states, spoke to creditors and
reporters at a special meeting.
   They sought to reassure creditors about the ultimate repayment
of the debt but were cautious.
   ``Some of it will have to disappear,'' Miller said. ``For those
who hold the debt, the market is no longer there. We want them to
get a reasonable recovery.''
   Miller, Federated-Allied Chairman Allen Questrom, and President
James Zimmerman read prepared statements and didn't answer
questions.
   Zimmerman told the creditors that by September 1989, it was
evident to senior managers that Federated and Allied could not meet
their debt payments and that major financial restructuring was
necessary.
   But he said the decision to file for bankruptcy court protection
was made in January to prevent further erosion in the value of the
businesses.
   ``There was no plot to deceive any creditors. There was no grand
scheme in Toronto or elsewhere to trick anybody,'' Zimmerman said.
   ``We regret that any of our creditors were left holding the bag
with checks that did not clear prior to our filing.
   ``It is my personal goal _ as well as our corporate expectations
_ that the reorganization plan to be developed will maximize the
return to all creditors.
   ``I hope that all of our trade creditors will be paid in full,
and we anticipate working with all of our creditors toward that
objective.''
   Zimmerman pledged to creditors, ``You will find us to be open,
honest and straightforward.''
   Miller, a former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, said he assumed
leadership last month of the parent company, Campeau (U.S.), on
condition that it be renamed and assured autonomy, distancing
itself from Robert Campeau, the Canadian real estate developer who
engineered the debt-financed takeovers of Allied and Federated.

   News Corp. Ltd., the Australia-based media
conglomerate headed by Rupert Murdoch, reported Thursday its
second-quarter profit tumbled 62 percent, partly due to higher
interest expenses, the impact of a labor dispute and start-up
losses from a television operation in the United Kingdom.
   News Corp. said it earned $86.4 million, or 60 cents per
American depository receipt (ADR), for the three months ended Dec.
31, down from $224.3 million, or $1.35 per ADR, a year earlier.
   Each ADR is equivalent to two News Corp. common shares and the
ADRs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Revenue was nearly flat at $1.66 billion compared with $1.65
billion a year ago.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, News Corp.'s earnings
plunged 67 percent to $117 million, or 83 cents per ADR, from
$357.4 million, or $2.18 per ADR, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the first half rose 8.3 percent to $3.17 billion
from $2.93 billion a year earlier.
   News Corp. said its results were affected by startup losses in
its Sky Television service in the United Kingdom, higher interest
expense and the impact of a 14-week dispute by pilots of Ansett
Airlines in Australia.
   The company's U.S. operations turned in a strong performance as
its TV stations, its Fox Broadcasting and its magazines registered
firm gains.

<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board Options Exchange on Thursday
announced disciplinary measures against six people, including four
former Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. brokers, for violating of trading
rules.
   Without admitting or denying the charges against them, all six
consented to censures and suspensions from association with any
CBOE member for varying lengths of time.
   Two of the men, including one of the former Dean Witter brokers,
also were suspended temporarily from exchange membership.
   Each of the former Dean Witter brokers was accused of numerous
offenses including trading for customers' accounts without proper
authorization and executing trades that were unsuitable based on
customers' knowledge and experience in financial matters.
   Two of the former Dean Witter brokers, Bruce A. Dembroski and
David H. Coltin, worked in the company's Burlington, Mass., office.
Each was suspended for one year from association with any exchange
member. Coltin also was suspended for one year from exchange
membership.
   Kenneth A. Rosenthal, a former broker in Dean Witter's Boston
office, was suspended for two years from association with any
exchange member.
   Michael W. Pursely, a former broker in Dean Witter's Clearwater,
Fla., office was suspended for nine months from association with
any exchange member.
   Also disciplined were two CBOE market makers, or independent
floor traders, Gregory S. De Fotis and Jeffrey A. Rahn.
   De Fotis was accused of failing to contribute to the maintenance
of a fair and orderly market and was suspended for four days from
exchange membership and from association with any member.
   Rahn was accused of manipulating trades in such a way that the
cost of trading was improperly reduced. He was fined $1,000 and
suspended for two weeks from associating with exchange members.

<HEAD>UMW To Go Ahead With Pittston Contract Vote</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS grafs 7-8, `The Pittston ... the contract' with 5 grafs

<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The United Mine Workers said Thursday it
will let its 1,700 striking miners vote on a contract with Pittston
Coal Group rather than wait for a final ruling on $64 million in
fines against the union.
   The union had previously said it would withhold a rank-and-file
vote until all legal action taken against the UMW for its strike
tactics was resolved.
   ``The union will continue to defend the interests of our members
and the organization in the courts, but will no longer defer the
ratification vote,'' UMW President Richard Trumka said Thursday.
``Our members at Pittston fought long and hard to secure this
tentative agreement, and it is their right to see it and vote on
it.''
   The tentative contract was reached New Year's Eve with the help
of William Usery, a mediator appointed by Labor Secretary Elizabeth
Dole.
   The result of the secret balloting Monday should be known
Tuesday, more than two years after the expiration of the old
contract and 11 months after the start of the bitter strike by
miners in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   The union and company have withheld the terms of the settlement,
but sources familiar with the agreement said the union won
concessions on the two biggest concerns: job security and health
and retirement benefits.
   The Pittson strike drew wide attention because of the use of
mass sit-down demonstrations to block coal trucks. Because the
union contended Pittston was attempting to break the union, the
sparked sympathetic wildcat strikes during the summer involving
46,000 UMW members from Appalachia and the Midwest.
   Between 150 and 200 union district and local leaders began
hearing details of the contract from UMW officials Thursday
evening. There were extensive questions about the tentative
agreement, which several miners refused to discuss in detail.
   ``It takes a long time to go through it article by article and
there are some new things in it,'' said Mike Buckner, director of
research in the union's Washington office.
   ``We tried to go as slow as members want us to explain
everything in the contract,'' Buckner said. ``There are new job
opportunity benefits in there and there are a lot of questions
about that.''
   Buckner declined to discuss any further details about the
agreement. The union wants to give the miners an opportunity to see
the contract before releasing it to the media, he said.
   When the settlement was announced Jan. 1, Trumka said a
ratification vote would hinge on the settlement of all legal action
connected with the strike.
   On Monday, however, Circuit Judge Donald McGlothlin refused to
dismiss $64 million in fines for hundred of violations of
court-ordered strike restrictions.
   ``The wheels of justice are turning slowly in certain courts,
and our members at Pittston have waited long enough,'' Trumka said
Thursday.
   McGlothlin rejected arguments made by attorneys for the union
and the company, which joined in the motion to drop the fines, and
he refused the union's offer of 10,000 hours of community service.
   However, he gave the attorneys 10 days to come up with another
proposal to clear the contempt-of-court fines.
   On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Glen Williams agreed to reduce
the fines he levied from $960,000 to $280,000.

<HEAD>Pickens Partnership Blames Low Natural Gas Prices For Quarter,
Annual Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Limited Partnership, the oil and gas
operation run by T. Boone Pickens, blamed lower natural gas prices
and higher interest rates for losses in the fourth quarter and all
of 1989.
   The company, which in December suspended quarterly payments to
unitholders, said it lost $42.67 million, or 25 cents a unit, on
revenues of $77.84 million in the three months ended Dec. 31.
   That compares with a profit of $13.26 million, or 14 cents a
unit, on $81.85 million in revenues in the same 1988 quarter.
   For the year, Mesa lost $63.02 million, or 24 cents a unit,
compared with profits of $46.09 million, or 52 cents, in 1988.
Revenues fell to $356.02 million last year from 1988's $370.61
million.
   The annual figures include gains from sale of oil and gas
properties of $29 million last year and $13 million in 1988.
   In December, Pickens said the company would quit paying its
37.5-cent quarterly distribution to maintain ``financial integrity
while gas prices remain low.''
   In addition, Pickens said Mesa would package its holdings in the
Hugoton natural gas field into a separate trust and sell shares to
raise $300 million to help pay down its $1.5 billion in long-term
debt.
   Previously, Mesa had maintained payments on units, which are
akin to common stock dividends by a corporation, even though
earnings from its oil and gas business didn't support the
distribution.
   Instead, the company made payments from profits gained on
Pickens' celebrated stock forays against such companies as Gulf Oil
Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Unocal.
   Mesa said it earned $50.1 million on securities last year,
compared with $20.1 million in 1988.

<HEAD>CIGNA Reports 33 Percent Increase In Earnings For 4th Quarter 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIGNA Corp., the insurance and employee
benefit group, said its earnings rose 33 percent in the fourth
quarter and 26 percent in 1989 as big investment gains helped
offset losses from Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake.
   Fourth quarter earnings totaled $184 million, or $2.35 a share,
on revenues of $4.14 billion. That compared with earnings of $138
million, or $1.70 a share, on revenues of $3.92 billion for the
final quarter of 1988.
   The company realized $51 million in investment gains after tax
in the latest quarter, up from $7 million a year earlier.
   For the year, earnings totaled $562 million, or $7 a share, on
revenues of $15.6 billion. That was up from earnings of $445
million, or $5.34 a share, on revenues of $14.8 billion in 1988.
   Investment gains for the year rose to $104 million from $8
million a year earlier. The latest year's gain included $81 million
from the sale of CIGNA's Horace Mann group of companies.
   Operating income in the company's property and casualty
insurance business plunged to $27 million in 1989 from $249 million
in 1988. Pre-tax catastrophe losses totalled $160 million for
Hurricane Hugo and the Bay area quake.

<HEAD>KKR-Affiliated Partnership to Buy 3.38 Million Shares of FIB</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A partnership affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. has agreed to boost its stake in First Interstate
Bancorp to nearly 10 percent by buying part of the bank's stock
offering, First Interstate said Wednesday.
   The Kohlberg Kravis partnership will pay $111,540,000 for 3.38
million shares, or $33 a share. The partnership also may purchase
up to an additional 112,275 shares under the agreement, First
Interstate said.
   The agreement will raise Kohlberg Kravis' stake in the Los
Angeles-based bank-holding company to approximately 9.98 percent
from 4.6 percent currently. Under the agreement, the buyout
specialist firm agreed not to increase its stake for at least two
years.
   The stock is part of an offering of 7.5 million shares First
Interstate is making.
   The bank, the nation's 10th largest with $58 billion in assets,
has been struggling to shore up its finances to cope with heavy
losses recently on real estate investments in Texas and Arizona.
   Last month the bank reported a $344.3 million loss in the fourth
quarter of 1989 after taking a $400 million charge to cover losses
in its Texas subsidiary.
   ``KKR has been a perceptive and knowledgeable owner of our
stock, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with
them,'' said Joseph J. Pinola, First Interstate's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   George R. Roberts, a founding partner of the buyout firm, said
he expects First Interstate's business strategies will improve the
long-term value of its stock.
   ``We look forward to continuing our role as long-term investors
in the company,'' he said.

<HEAD>Canadian Pacific Withdraws, D&amp;H's Future Unclear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal agency has ordered limited
service be maintained on the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway until a
hearing late this week to consider a plan to keep the ailing
railroad running, a bankruptcy trustee said.
   D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operating railway, had
faced a midnight deadline to begin shutting down before the order
was issued.
   Francis P. Dicello, D&amp;H trustee, said he had not seen late
Wednesday's order by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but was
told it called for ``reduced service'' for 48 hours until a hearing
Friday to consider a proposal to allow two other railways to run
D&amp;H for at least 30 days.
   No other officials could be reached late Wednesday to comment on
the order.
   The New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad submitted a
proposal earlier Wednesday to operate D&amp;H for at least 30 days,
according to Ken Willsey, spokesman for Delaware Otsego Corp.,
parent of New York Susquehanna.
   The proposal has the backing of the Federal Railroad
Administration.
   ``We've been fighting to try to save the railroad for weeks
now,'' said Gil Carmichael, federal railroad administrator.
   The ICC designated New York Susquehanna to operate D&amp;H after the
rail line filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1988.
Creditors have about $100 million in claims against the railroad.
   D&amp;H faced a shutdown after the collapse Tuesday of a planned
sale of the railway to Canadian Pacific Ltd.
   An emergency hearing was held in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington Wednesday to decide D&amp;H's fate.
   CP had agreed to purchase D&amp;H for $35 million but pulled out of
the deal after failing to agree to terms with Conrail on the use of
Conrail tracks that connect with D&amp;H lines.
   In the absence of a purchase agreement and with no pending bids
Wednesday, Dicello said officials would begin shutting down D&amp;H if
the ICC did not grant a reprieve. A complete shutdown would take
four to five days, according to Stanley Samorajczyk, an attorney
for Dicello.
   Plans then would be made to begin selling off D&amp;H's assets.
   Walter Rich, president and chief executive officer of New York
Susquehanna, said if the rail line was allowed to continue to
operate, it could provide service to 99 percent of its shippers.
   Canadian National Railroad said it would help cover some of
D&amp;H's operating costs if the New York Susequehanna plan was
approved. Canadian National tried to bid for D&amp;H but lost financial
backing for its offer last week.
   Delaware Otsego was among five earlier bidders who lost out in
January when Dicello selected Canadian Pacific's bid for D&amp;H.
   Carmichael said he was encouraged by the partnership between
Canadian National and New York Susquehanna to keep D&amp;H running.
   He declined to speculate on whether either company would make a
new offer but noted that ``Rich wanted to buy D&amp;H for a long time
and CN wanted to be a player in it.''
   D&amp;H, which began in 1824 as a canal company, runs 20 to 25
trains daily in New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
Quebec. It owns 550 miles of track and has traffic rights to
another 1,000, Willsey said.
   A shutdown would put 672 employees out of work and eliminate the
hope of return for 100 to 150 others on furlough, he said.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. took further steps
to dismantle an operation that once was the envy of Wall Street,
shopping around businesses, liquidating its financial holdings and
planning benefits for the thousands of employees likely to be fired.
   Details of the staggering financial troubles that caused the

Court by Drexel's parent, which listed more than 2,000 creditors
and close to $3 billion in liabilities. The parent company, Drexel

<HEAD>Mill Employees Sympathize With Firm That Made Them Owner-Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just over a year ago pin-striped investment
bankers from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. were zipping in and out of
the tiny town of Omak, helping employees finance a $50 million
buyout of their lumber mill.
   Now that the once cocksure investment house has filed for
bankruptcy protection, the workers who become owners and saved
their jobs through Drexel's skills expressed sympathy for for the
firm's plight.
   ``They were really a human-oriented company with us,'' Lloyd
Groomes, head of the local Lumber and Sawmill Workers Union, said
Wednesday. ``They got on board right at the first and joined in
with us.''
   The deal to purchase Omak Wood Products Inc. was financed by
junk bonds and loans to be repaid from future earnings. The workers
made no down payment and the plant itself was put up for security.
   At the time, Drexel touted the deal as the first in which
workers bought a healthy company using a significant amount of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds for financing. The firm promoted
junk bonds as a way to provide financing for ventures like employee
buyouts that traditionally have had a hard time getting funding
through banks or the stock market.
   Ironically, Drexel's filing for protection under Chapter 11 of
federal bankruptcy laws on Tuesday was the result of a cash
shortage triggered largely by a sharp drop in value of its own
holdings of junk bonds.
   Drexel's filing may put a temporary hold on future debt-financed
employee buyouts like the one at Omak, one banking analyst
predicted.
   ``This has to have a chilling effect in the short term,'' said
Jay Tejera of Dain Bosworth Inc. in Seattle. ``But you won't see
the pendulum swing all the way back to where equity is preferential
and leveraged capital is impossible to find.''
   The employee buyout in December 1988 capped a six-month blitz in
which Drexel, which pioneered the use of junk bonds to finance
takeovers and buyouts, convinced British financier Sir James
Goldsmith that the 630 employees of Omak Wood Products were serious
buyers. Goldsmith had acquired the mill as part of his 1985
takeover of Crown Zellerbach Co.
   Drexel provided a $50 million bridge loan to finance the deal
until the employees could obtain permanent funding. It also
provided the business expertise mill workers lacked.
   Pat Flanagan, a vice president of the investment bank, still
serves on the mill's board of directors, Groomes said.
   Without the help of Drexel, the Omak plant would have been sold
by Goldsmith to one of several corporations interested in the
profitable company, Groomes said.
   The mill, the largest employer in the town of 4,000 located 150
miles north of Yakima, had been sold three times to out-of-town
owners in the previous 32 years. Each sale resulted in job cuts at
the plant, which once had 1,200 employees, Groomes said.
   When workers got word in the summer of 1988 that another sale
was coming, they organized and Groomes contacted Drexel, asking for
help in financing an employee buyout.
   Soon, Drexel employees were jetting into Spokane and driving the
150 miles to Omak, he said.
   ``They gave Sir James a (letter) to assure him we wasn't
whistling in the dark,'' Groomes said. ``They said they'd
underwrite $35 million before he considered us a serious bidder.''
   Drexel eventually put up the $35 million purchase price, plus
nearly $15 million in operating expenses. That money carried the
employees until they were able to secure permanent bank financing
just three months ago, said Bill Kenny, human resource manager at
the mill.
   ``We're saddened by (their) current financial status,'' Kenny
said. ``We fully realize that we as an ESOP (employee stock
ownership plan) would not be here without the help of Drexel
Burnham.''
   ``We're doing real well, above our expectations,'' Groomes said
of the company.
   Finding someone to do similar employee buyouts in the future may
be difficult, Tejera said.
   ``A lot of those deals are done already,'' he said. ``You don't
have a backlog of deals to do.''
   But the technique remains sound, especially in mature businesses
that generate cash and don't have high research and development and
capital costs, he said.
   Tejera predicted that insurance companies, pension funds and
mid-sized regional banks would step into the void left by Drexel.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. owes money
from California to the Bank of China, but two of its largest
potential creditors don't appear in court papers: indicted junk
bond maven Michael Milken and the federal government.
   Drexel does not consider Milken, who is believed to be owed more
than $200 million by his former employer, to be a legitimate
creditor, Steven Anreder, a spokesman for the firm, said Wednesday.
   Largely responsible for Drexel's lightning growth in the 1980s,
Milken left the firm last June after he was charged in a 98-count
federal fraud and racketeering indictment. Milken claims he is owed
back compensation and payment for Drexel stock that was required to
sell back to the company.
   Drexel last year pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to
pay $650 million to settle related charges.
   But Drexel still owes $150 million of the settlement to a
Securities and Exchange Commission fund established to repay
investors who can prove they were harmed by Drexel's actions. SEC
Enforcement Director William McLucas confirmed Drexel owes the
money but declined to comment further.
   As Drexel began to dismantle an operation that once was the envy
of Wall Street, fears that the collapse would cause turmoil in the
nation's stock, bond and commodities markets proved unfounded.
   Prices of junk bonds rallied for a second straight day,
government bonds dipped only slightly and stock prices were stable.
   ``I think the Street's breathing a sign of relief that there
seems to be an orderly liquidation,'' said Lewis Glucksman, vice
chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``Drexel was no longer the single dominant figure in junks when
this happened,'' he said. ``That's one reason the Street has been
able to take his with equanimity. There was no market they were
going to rock apart.''
   Drexel continued to shop its businesses around, liquidate its
securities holdings and plan benefits for thousands of employees
likely to be fired.
   Bitter workers accused the company of concealing its problems.
Security guards prevented many employees from taking personal
belongings out of Drexel's New York headquarters.
   ``Maybe about a week and a half ago we had management telling us
that even though times were hard at Drexel, they were the same
troubles the rest of the Street was having,'' a Drexel junk bond
professional in New York said. ```Bear with us,' they said.''
   The parent company of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed for
Chapter 11 protection from creditors late Tuesday. Drexel already
has liquidated billions of dollars worth of government securities,
junk bonds and other securities, and is peddling entire divisions
to other Wall Street firms.
   It's not clear whether it will find any buyers, though. Unlike
manufacturing companies that own plants and inventories, an
investment bank's main assets are its people and client
relationships. With confidence in Drexel's ability to conduct
business shattered, it's possible no buyers will step forward.
   ``A lot of things that supposedly had worth as an entity become
liabilities,'' said a top executive at a competing Wall Street
firm. ``Any buyer knows there's a forced seller on the other side.''
   Drexel, which financed some of the biggest corporate takeovers
of the 1980s, collapsed because of a cash shortage caused by a
steep fall in value of its billion-dollar junk bond portfolio and
an erosion of confidence after the firm admitted to securities
crimes.
   ``They were terribly unprepared for this,'' said a former Drexel
senior executive who still has close ties to the firm.
   Insiders said Drexel failed to make even the most mundane
preparations for the bankruptcy filing. The firm's New York car
service refused to accept Drexel vouchers for fear they wouldn't
get paid. At Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office, one executive
had to pay for a plane ticket personally to get to a meeting
because Drexel's travel agency refused to extend credit.
   Drexel's case will be handled by Judge Howard C. Buschman III,
45, who has been on the bankruptcy bench since 1983.
   The parent company listed liabilities of $2.89 billion and
assets of $3.7 billion in the petition for bankruptcy court
reorganization. Including subsidiaries, total debt exceeds $3
billion, the papers show.
   The filing affects only the parent company, not the securities
subsidiary. Under federal bankruptcy law, broker-dealers are
ineligible for Chapter 11 reorganization.
   Drexel officials have made clear, though, that its securities
business won't survive after the firm's holdings of stocks and
bonds are sold.
   The largest unsecured creditor listed in the filing is Taiyo
Mutual Life of Tokyo, owed $69.7 million. Others include the state
of California's retirement system at $25 million and Bank of China
at $20 million.
   Resumes and phone calls from Drexel workers flooded other Wall
Street firms, executives reported. Drexel has not formally laid off
its 5,300 employees but is devising severance packages, officials
said.

<HEAD>Unions Punishing Eastern Pilots, Attendants Who Returned to Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pilots and flight attendants who went back to
work and weakened a lengthy strike now face the possibility of
fines or other unspecified penalties imposed by their unions.
   The Air Line Pilots Association is seeking fines of around
$10,000 plus $1,000 per day worked during the nine-month strike for
each returning pilot, Al Gallo, a spokesman for the Eastern pilots
union, said Wednesday.
   The Transport Workers Union, which represents Eastern flight
attendants, has disenfranchised some picket-crossers from voting in
union elections but hasn't decided whether it will seek fines.
   Eastern is providing attorneys for the employees that have
received penalty notices, said spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.
   ``Obviously, a union regards crossing picket lines as an act of
disloyalty,'' said Mark Kahn, a labor arbitrator in Detroit.
   Under their constitutions, he said, most unions have the right
to fine members, expel them or consider them in bad standing.
   ALPA recently sent such letters to 700 to 800 returning pilots,
charging them with violating Article 8 of the group's bylaws by
crossing a picket line, Gallo said. He said hearings have been held
in Washington on 200 to 300 cases, some of which have gone to
ALPA's Appeals Board.
   If cases continue after that they could go to federal courts,
Gallo said.
   Some of the returning pilots, who work at Eastern along with
fliers hired to replace strikers, have voluntarily resigned from
the pilots union.
   Around 1,600 to 2,000 formerly striking pilots remain out of
work, Gallo said.
   ALPA, the legal representative of both working and non-working
pilots, is seeking a return to work in contract talks with
management. But Eastern says its pilot staffing needs have been met
and is seeking to protect the jobs of newly hired fliers.
   The pilots and flight attendants struck in sympathy with
Machinists last March 4 but called off the walkout in late November.
   The Machinists union remains on strike against the airline,
which is restructuring as a smaller carrier under federal
bankruptcy court supervision.
   Hearings have been held on a number of flight attendants' cases
in Miami, Atlanta, Boston, New York and Newark, N.J., said Sandra
Mickley, recording secretary for the Transport Workers local at
Eastern.
   Some union members have been found to be in bad standing,

   Generous incentives helped boost sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks by 7.9 percent in early
February, but they didn't help the Big Three automakers stop a loss
of market share to Japanese transplants.
   Combined car and truck sales for General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. were up 6 percent in early February,
trailing growth in the overall market.
   The nation's eight major makers reported that car sales, which
trailed last year's pace in January, showed a 10.1 percent increase
in the Feb. 1-10 period. Domestic truck sales were up 4 percent.
   Car buyers responded to aggressive incentives offered by the
automakers, said Jeannette Garretty, an analyst at Bank of America
in San Francisco.
   After sales turned down in late 1989, carmakers offered stronger
enticements, including the guaranteed rebate program Chrysler
Chairman Lee A. Iacocca touted in Super Bowl television ads. Under
that program, buyers will receive the difference if Chrysler
increases incentives on an eligible vehicles any time through Sept.
30.
   With the economy sluggish, incentives are likely to persist,
Garretty said.
   Sales won't remain as strong as early February's without ``a lot
of work on the part of the manufacturers, which is a euphemism for
saying it's going to cost them,'' she said.
   GM, Ford and Chrysler said they sold 7.2 percent more cars than
in early February 1989. Ford led the surge with a 14.3 percent jump.
   Chrysler reported an 8.4 percent drop in car sales and a 16.5
percent drop in truck sales for the period. The company stopped
giving rebates on its popular minivan models, which are classified
as trucks, on Jan. 31.
   Chrysler's truck sales so far this calendar year are up 27.2
percent, while car sales are off by 2.9 percent.
   Chrysler reported Tuesday that it lost $664 million in the
fourth quarter of 1989, largely because of costs of cutting jobs
and closing plants to trim down for intense competition in the
sluggish auto market.
   GM and Ford were preparing to report 1989 earnings on Thursday.
   Overall, the eight domestic automakers reported selling cars and
trucks at an average daily rate of 19,316 during early February,
compared with a rate of 17,539 cars a day in the same period last
year.
   The Big Three's share of the domestic market slipped to 87.6
percent for Feb. 1-10 from 91.5 percent in the same period last
year. The remainder was divided among transplants _ the American
plants owned by Honda, Mazda, Toyota, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
   For the year through Feb. 10, North American-made truck sales
showed an 11.8 percent rise and car sales were up 4.6 percent.
   Among the Big Three, Ford said its Feb. 1-10 jump in car sales
was accompanied by a 10.9-percent growth in light truck sales. For
the year to date, Ford truck sales were up 1.8 percent while car
sales were down 2.8 percent.
   GM said its truck sales rose 10.1 percent and car sales were up
6.7 percent in early February, with an 11.5 percent gain in truck
sales and a 3.1 percent rise in car sales for the year.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc Vows Probe of New Corruption Allegations</HEAD>

   An indicted futures trader allegedly told the FBI
that widespread corruption dominates the Chicago Merchantile
Exchange, a charge officials at the world's second largest futures
exchange are vowing to investigate.
   ``We are obliged to investigate any claims that are brought to
our attention,'' Merc spokesman Andrew Yemma said Wednesday.
   The statements attributed to Robert H. Bailin, one of 48 people
indicted in a federal probe of trading fraud at the Merc and the
Chicago Board of Trade, surfaced Tuesday in pretrial documents
filed in U.S. District Court by the U.S. attorney's office.
   Bailin is seeking to have the statements suppressed during his
trial.
   The court documents contain transcripts of FBI interviews of
Bailin in January 1989, six months before he was indicted by a
federal grand jury.
   The documents allege Bailin told FBI agents that corruption at
the Merc was so widespread that on one day more than twice as many
pork belly futures were illegally traded outside the pork belly pit
as were traded inside it.
   Bailin also is alleged to have described kickbacks ``to the big
guys upstairs'' _ brokers who telephone orders down to the exchange
floor _ and allegedly told FBI agents that the 140-year-old
tradition of trading futures by hollering and signaling to other
traders in a crowded, recessed pit had been compromised by
corruption.
   ``The open-outcry system does not work at the Merc,'' Bailin is
alleged to have told the FBI.
   Bailin, a 37-year-old trader of Japanese yen futures, and two
other indicted yen traders are seeking to suppress statements they
allegedly made to FBI agents. The traders contend they were
illegally coerced into making the statements during interviews.
   In a court hearing last month, Bailin said the statements
attributed to him by the government were taken out of context, said
Edward Genson, one of Bailin's lawyers.
   But Genson noted in an interview Wednesday that the issue
currently before U.S. District Judge William T. Hart ``is not the
validity of the statements that were alleged to have been made. The
issue is whether the statements were properly taken.''
   Twenty yen traders have been indicted so far in the sweeping
government probe. Bailin and 15 others who have pleaded innocent
are scheduled to go to trial May 21, according to a clerk in Hart's
office.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, the Merc's board of directors issued a
blueprint for the 1990s that called for the exchange to regain
public confidence and to develop several new sources of revenue.
   ``In order to maintain our successful momentum, there must be
absolute confidence in the integrity of our markets,'' the board's
statement said.
   The board also proposed a new business venture, the CME Resource
and Service Co., to develop new products and services for market
users. Some of the ventures may include publishing,
telecommunications services, accounting services and trade-clearing
for markets other than the Merc, Chairman Leo Melamed said.
