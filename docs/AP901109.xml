<TEXT>
   Truth has been critically wounded,
at the very least, by partisan journalism that inflames the bitter
ethnic rivalries of this patchwork nation.
   Yugoslavia's freewheeling press, once the most open of Eastern
Europe, has become increasingly provincial, entangled in local
conflicts.
   The trend is evident in all six Yugoslav republics, but the
state-run press and television of Serbia seem to lead in the way.
   Headlines scream ``Hellish Police Hunt on Serbs'' over accounts
of routine investigations in Croatia. An article on federal reforms
aimed at creating a market economy is introduced with: ``Serbian
Economy Knifed in Back.''
   Accusations flying between Communist-ruled Serbia, the largest
republic, and the freely elected governments of Slovenia and
Croatia have created such animosity that Yugoslavia may not
survive.
   Serbs and Croats, the largest ethnic groups in this nation of 24
million, have been rivals since 1918, when the country was born as
the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. It was reconstituted as
a communist republic in 1945.
   Political and economic differences accentuate the ethnic
divisions in a power struggle that began with the death in 1980 of
Josip Tito, who founded the postwar nation and held it together.
   Croatia and Slovenia want Yugoslavia to be a loose confederation
of sovereign states. Serbia insists on a ``modern federation'' with
power still centralized in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal
capital.
   Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's populist leader, says he will
enlarge the republic to take in Serbs from other regions if the
fedration disintegrates.
   When Croatian police tried to recover hundreds of guns stolen
from government armories by local Serbs, banner headlines in Serbia
said: ``Croatian Police Throw Serbian Infants Around'' and
``Fascist Terrorists Sent to Subjugate Serbs.''
   Stories below the headlines in the dailies Politika and Politika
Ekspres did not support the allegations. They quoted
``well-informed sources,'' unnamed and not described, echoing
Serbian claims that Croatian police recruited ``fascist
terrorists'' to harass the 500,000 Serbs in Croatia.
   ``Poison seeps from the pages of Politika in all directions,''
said Croatian writer Slavko Mihalic. ``Everybody is denounced for
one thing or another, and that includes any Serbs who dare oppose
Milosevic.''
   Media in Slovenia and Croatia have accused Milosevic repeatedly
of fomenting ethnic turmoil.
   In the Croatian parliamewnt, deputy Stjepan Mesic waved a copy
of Politika and declared: ``Milosevic is guilty of stirring up the
trouble in Croatia.''
   Belgrade television reported ``all-out civil war'' between Serbs
and Croats in Croatia, although no one had been killed or seriously
injured.
   To tighten the grip on Serbian media, Milosevic and his
Communist supporters have fired or demoted hundreds of
independent-minded journalists.
   After the latest round of 20 demotions, the daily Vjesnik in
Zagreb, capital of Croatia, accused Serbs of ``pushing their
hard-line concepts to the brink of intercommunal violence to avoid
holding free elections.'' Serbia has scheduled elections for Dec.
9.
   ``Civil war may be the last refuge for hard-line Communists,''
Vjesnik declared.
   Calls for fairness by opposition parties and independent
journalists are ignored by Serbian television and the
once-respected Politika.
   In June, police with clubs broke up a demonstration against
biased coverage, beating several intellectuals and opposition
leaders.
   Television did not show what happened and said protesters
attacked the police. A television newscast in Croatia that included
footage of the violence was not broadcast in Belgrade.
   ``Two-thirds of what the Belgrade media say is lies,'' said Vuk
Draskovic, head of the opposition Serbian Renewal Movement, which
threatens to boycott the December elections unless unbiased
coverage is guaranteed.
   Serbian television, nicknamed ``Milosevision'' in Belgrade,
agreed to carry brief opposition statements. It insisted all 39
registered groups have equal time, however, even though only three
have significant followings.
   Serbian television, nicknamed ``Milosevision'' by residents of
Belgrade, carries short campaign speeches by opposition leaders
only on its third channel, seen in just one-sixth of the republic.
   Ante Markovic, the federal premier, is popular with Yugoslavs
generally, but not with Milosevic, who objects to his
market-oriented economic reforms and attempts to form a national
political party.
   Markovic has described in the press as an ``enemy of the Serbian
people out to plunder our republic.''
   In an effort to counter such treatment, the premier announced a
weekly federal television program to present fair coverage of
national issues. TV Belgrade refused to cooperate, effectively
keeping the one-hour program off the air in Serbia.
   Serbian media make their most abusive attacks on the ethnic
Albanian majority in the republic's southern province, Kosovo.
   Albanians in Kosovo have demonstrated regularly against
Milosevic's abolition of self-rule in the province, and Serbian
police have killed at least 60 in the past 18 months.
   The Serbian press portrays the demonstrators as ``terrorists''
who attack security forces with ``heavy machine guns and mortars.''
No Serbs have been killed or seriously hurt.
   International human rights groups that condemn the repression
are ``sworn enemies of the Serbs'' and members of the U.S. Congress
who visited Kosovo were ``mercenaries in the pay of the Albanian
lobby,'' the Belgrade papers say.

   NATO's top senior military officers
will travel to the Soviet Union this weekend to get a first-hand
look at the dramatic changes under way in the superpower.
   The visit begins in Moscow on Sunday and is the first such visit
by high-ranking military officers of the 16-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.
   The trip, announced Thursday, will be made by U.S. Gen. John R.
Galvin, the alliance's supreme military commander in Europe, and
Norwegian Gen. Vigleik Eide, chairman of NATO's military committee.
   The visit is part of series of discussions that have taken place
in the last year among top political and military leaders of the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and the Western nations.
   Soviet Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of the general staff,
stopped by the Western alliance late last month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration hasn't uttered the
dreaded ``R'' word yet concerning the economy, but it is getting
awfully close.
   President Bush on Thursday talked about ``tough times'' and
Michael Boskin, his chief economic adviser, spoke of the
possibility that the economy could contract in either the final
three months of this year or early 1991.
   Bush and Boskin both avoided using the term recession, but
Boskin opened the door to that possibility by discussing the
chances that the gross national product, the country's total output
of goods and services, might decline in one or more quarters.
   The traditional definition of a recession is two consecutive
quarters of declining GNP.
   The comments were much gloomier than administration forecasts
before Tuesday's elections. Administration officials had been
talking in hopeful terms that the oil shock from Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait might not be severe enough to push the economy over the
brink.
   ``We're in some tough times right now,'' Bush told reporters. He
said he would consult economists in and out of government to
discuss ways of cushioning the impact on American families.
   In a speech to the American Council for Capital Formation,
Boskin said, ``The economy at best is in a lull, but we do expect
that lull to be relatively brief and relatively minor.''
   He said the administration expects the negative impacts on
economic output to begin showing up in the current October-December
quarter.
   While the GNP grew at a modest annual rate of 1.8 percent in the
July-September quarter, Boskin said that rate could turn negative
in the current quarter. He also said it was possible the economic
contraction could last into early 1991.
   ``The short-term forecast, if anything, is even more uncertain
than normal because we just can't say for sure what the size and
duration of the oil shock will be,'' the presidential economic
adviser said.
   The country last suffered through a recession from 1981-82, a
slump brought on by the Federal Reserve as the central bank pushed
interest rates to levels not seen since the Civil War in an effort
to battle double-digit inflation.
   The cure worked and in November 1982 the nation embarked on a
record peacetime expansion.
   Boskin said the current oil shock, unlike those of 1973-74 and
1979, was occurring during a period of relative price stability.
For that reason, he said, he expected any adverse impact to be
short in duration.
   He said his ``best guess'' was that the nation would return to
healthier growth rates by the middle of next year.
   While Bush did not elaborate on what programs the administration
might propose to bolster the sagging economy, Boskin said the
administration would review a variety of pro-growth measures to
include in next year's budget and the State of the Union address.
   Boskin said a renewed effort to enact a capital gains tax cut
could be in the package.
   In his remarks to reporters, Bush expressed strong opposition to
further tax hikes, saying the only way that Democrats will be able
to raise income tax rates will be ``over my dead veto.''

   Here are the forces that Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney said will be deployed both from Europe and the United
States for Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf.
   Army troops from Germany:
   The 7th Corps Headquarters from Stuttgart; the 1st Armored
Division, Ansbach; the 3rd Armored Division, Frankfurt; a
brigade-size unit from the 2nd Armored Division, Garlstedt; the 2nd
Armored Cavalry Regiment, Nuernberg, and the 2nd Corps Support
Command, Stuttgart.
   From the United States:
   The 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Riley, Kan.
   Cheney said various units to support and service the additional
ground forces would be sent from the United States and Europe.
   Cheney said the Navy will send three additional aircraft carrier
battle groups, plus escort ships. He did not identify the carriers.
He said the USS Missouri battleship also would be sent with escort
vessels, as well as Amphibious Group Three from San Diego, Calif.
   The Marine Corps will be sending the 2nd Marine Expeditionary
Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C.; the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade
from Camp Pendleton, Calif., and the Maritime Prepositioning Ship
Squadron One, from Norfolk, Va.
   He said additional Air Force units may be tapped.
   ``There clearly will be a need to call up further reserve units,
and we will also will be calling up for the first time combat units
of the Army National Guard,'' Cheney said.
   Specifically, he said the units would include three National
Guard units: the 48th Infantry Brigade Mechanized from Georgia, the
155th Armored Brigade from Mississippi and the 256th Infantry
Brigade Mechanized from Louisiana.
   ``They will be called up in the period ahead, be given
substantial additional workup here at home and then a decision will
be made about whether or not they will be deployed overseas,''
Cheney said.
   ``It's conceivable that if we deem them combat-ready, that they
would be deployed as part of Operation Desert Shield,'' he said.
``It's also possible that they would be deployed here to fill in
behind units that we take out of the continental United States and
shipped to Saudi Arabia and the gulf.''

   Emperor Akihito formally assumes the world's oldest
hereditary throne Monday in lavish ceremonies that also may be an
important rite of passage for postwar Japan.
   No other monarch has ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne under the
constitution enacted in 1946.
   For the first time, a Japanese emperor is to be enthroned as
merely a national symbol, as stipulated by the constitution imposed
by the U.S. occupation after Japan's surrender in World War II.
   Most Japanese appear comfortable with the largely ceremonial
role of their new emperor, a remarkable break with the past. The
late Emperor Hirohito, Akihito's father, was enthroned as a living
god and was the object of fanatical devotion.
   Even the official name the government has given Akihito's reign
- Achieving Peace - reflects a desire to move away from the
turbulent times of Hirohito, who died of cancer early last year.
   The monarchy dates to the 6th or 7th century, but the Japanese
public associates it most closely with Hirohito's 60-year reign. In
that period, Japan waged expansionist wars in the name of the
emperor, suffered a crushing defeat and foreign occupation, then
rose to become an economic superpower.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his father's
death, but his formal enthronement awaited a year of mourning and
the growing of ``sacred'' rice for a coronation rite.
   During the interval, Akihito has tried to create a softer, more
open image for the often aloof royal family, insisting on fewer
uniformed police along his procession routes and addressing people
with the title ``san,'' a term of respect similar to Mr. or Mrs. in
English.
   Reflecting the different times in which they were raised,
Akihito is believed to be more democratic in thinking than his
father, and has pledged to ``protect the constitution along with
the people.''
   Empress Michiko, the first commoner to marry a future Japanese
monarch, is crafting her own quiet revolution inside the royal
household, in large part by providing Akihito with a family life
similar to that of ``common'' Japanese.
   She broke tradition, for example, by making clear that her
children would not be taken away and raised by strangers.
   Although the palace remains distant to most Japanese, opinion
polls indicate it has wide public support. Few, however, still see
their monarch as a god.
   Government officials say they have taken pains to adapt the
enthronement ceremonies to a more democratic age. They also have
hewn closely to prewar precedent for the nearly month-long rites,
however, creating widespread concern that the ``new era'' might
actually represent a step backward in time.
   Royalty, heads of state and other dignitaries from more than 150
nations will be in Tokyo when Akihito announces his accession on
Monday.
   The main coronation ceremony will be at the imperial palace, an
oasis of greenery in cetral Tokyo built in the late 19th century
on the site of a former samurai castle.
   Akihito will ascend a 20-foot-tall throne on a three-layered
dais of black lacquer, beneath an octagonal roof adorned with
golden mirrors and phoenixes.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will stand before the throne as
Akihito, in a reddish-brown kimono with a design of paulownia
trees, bamboo and mythical animals, reads an address announcing his
accession.
   Kaifu will lead the Japanese among the 2,500 guests in three
rounds of ``Banzai!'' - a traditional cheer for long life - to
conclude the 30-minute ceremony.
   Officials say Akihito will read his announcement in colloquial
Japanese, unlike Hirohito's use of stilted classical language most
Japanese cannot understand.
   To reflect the postwar constitution's emphasis on popular
sovereignty, Kaifu will lead the banzai cheers from a point level
with the throne instead of descending several steps, as his
predecessors did.
   An official in the prime minister's office told reporters a
military salute coinciding with the enthronement would be reduced
from 100 to 21 cannon shots because ``that's the way foreign
dignitaries are received.''
   Aside from such cosmetic adjustments, Akihito's coronation is
expected to be much like those held since his great-grandfather
assumed the throne in the middle of the last century.
   In what many critics of the government see as a snub to the
constitution, about 2.5 billion yen ($17 million) in public money
will be spent on a rite steeped in Shinto, Japan's state religion
until 1945.
   In that rite, to begin 10 days after the main coronation
ceremony, Akihito will step back into the world of myth for a
``communion'' of fresh rice with the sun goddess, from whom the
imperial line is said to have descended, and all the gods of heaven
and earth.
   Opponents say public funding violates the constitutional
separation of church and state. The Kaifu administration argues
that the money is not being used to promote religion, but to
preserve an important cultural tradition.
   Critics emphasize that the rite has undergone major changes
during its 1,200 years of existence. It was ignored for more than
200 years, beginning in the late 15th century.
   In response to questions about whether holding the Daijosai, or
Great Food Offering Ritual, is intended to restore living-god
status to Akihito and future emperors, Nobuo Ishihara, the deputy
cabinet secretary, replied:
   ``I am aware that there were some scholars in the prewar period
who claimed that, through performance of the Daijosai, the emperor
assumed a divine nature. However, the government is not in a
position to make any comment as to whether the emperor does or does
not.''
   Police have begun Japan's largest security operation, mainly
because ultra-leftist radical groups have said they will disrupt
the ceremonies. A bomb believed planted by radicals exploded last
week at a Tokyo police dormitory, killing one officer and wounding
six other people.
   Late last month, 26,000 Tokyo police officers were mobilized for
security in the capital, and at least 6,000 more have been brought
in since. Nearly 45 percent of the total coronation budget of 12.3
billion yen ($94.6 million) is being spent on security.
   A high-ranking National Police Agency official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the extraordinary security was
justified because leftist radicals ``are planning to attack the
palace with explosive rockets.''
   He said police believe one group has devised mortar-like weapons
with a range of nearly four miles.
   Along with protecting the many visiting dignitaries, including
Prince Charles of Britain and Vice Presidnt Dan Quayle, the police
are concerned about security for a parade after the coronation.
   Akihito and Empress Michiko are to ride in a convertible in the
30-minute procession from the imperial palace to the royal
residence at Akasaka Palace.
   Officials say about 10,000 officers will line the three-mile
route.

   Clad in white robes reserved for the holiest
ceremonies, Emperor Akihito will complete his accession to the
throne by communing with the Shinto gods in a room bathed in
flickering torchlight.
   Palace officials say the communion, part of an enthronement
ritual more than 1,200 years old, has become an integral part of
imperial succession and is an important aspect of Japanese culture.
   It also has given rise to heated constitutional debate and
allegations that the government seeks to revive the ``living god''
status of former monarchs.
   Members of the leading opposition party, the Socialists, plan to
boycott the rite. The head of the Japan Federation of Bar
Associations has questioned its constitutionality and the National
Christian Council of Japan has collected nearly 80,000 signatures
on a petition against it.
   The ceremony, to begin just after dark Nov. 22 and end before
dawn, is known as the Daijosai, or Great Food Offering Ritual.
   About 900 Japanese dignitaries will gather for the ceremony at a
special complex of buildings recently completed on the grounds of
the imperial palace in central Tokyo. No foreigners are invited.
   Among the guests will be Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, speakers
of both houses of Parliament, the chief justice of the Supreme
Court and the cream of Japanese society.
   Ancient court music will be played as the guests are seated in
two large tents. A procession of chamberlains and palace officials,
clad in traditional kimonos, will escort the emperor to one of two
ceremonial halls.
   In a lantern-lit inner chamber, well away from the sight of the
guests, Akihito will be assisted by two female attendants as he
begins the rite.
   Sitting on a bamboo floor covered with rush matting, he will
pray and offer newly harvested and polished rice to the sun
goddess, from whom the imperial line is said to have descended.
   He then will join all the gods of heaven and earth in a
communion of rice, rice wine and produce from all over Japan,
including squid, abalone and chestnuts.
   Just after midnight, the ceremony will be repeated in the other
hall.
   Relatively few details of the mystical ceremony were known to
the public until earlier this century.
   Because each of the inner chambers contains a stylized bed,
scholars have argued that, at one time, the rite may have involved
the emperor symbolically having intercourse with the sun goddess,
thus becoming one with the divine.
   Palace officials say the bed represents the place where the gods
rest until summoned for the communion.
   Iwao Miyao, deputy head of the Imperial Household Agency, which
supervises palace affairs, told reporters recently that prayers
offered by previous emperors indicate the rite is not intended to
bestow divine status on the monarch.
   Miyao quoted a prayer by Emperor Gotsuchimikado in 1466 that was
an appeal to the sun goddess for peace, abundant crops and
blessings on ``all the people, both high and low.''
   He said that prayer and two others had, ``for some reason or
other,'' become known outside the palace. Miyao refused to divulge
what Akihito will say because ``such matters are intended
exclusively for the deities.''
   Akihito is to be the first monarch enthroned under Japan's
postwar constitution, written while Japan was administered by
Allied occupation forces after World War II.
   Although the charter redefined the role of the emperor from that
of ``sacred'' sovereign to a largely symbolic one, Akihito's
Daijosai will be essentially the same as those of his father,
grandfather and great-grandfather.
   Critics consider this important, since the content of those
rites was strongly influenced by those who wanted to restore
imperial rule and build a national cult of emperor worship.
   The cult was used later to rally the nation to war.
   Opponents also point out that the late Hirohito, the new
emperor's father, renounced his divinity in 1946. They claim
Akihito's Daijosai amounts to a retraction of that historic
decision.

<TEXT>
   Bulgaria is more democratic a year after
a Politburo coup ousted Stalinist leader Todor Zhivkov, but it also
is a divided nation heading for economic disaster.
   Many Bulgarians were taken by surprise when Zhivkov fell Nov.
10, 1989, after 35 years in power. Dissidents and ordinary people
celebrated, but there has been little cause for rejoicing since.
   Exhorting Bulgarians into the streets of Sofia, the fledgling
opposition forced talks in January with the governing Communists,
who hurriedly began implementing reforms after Zhivkov was thrown
out.
   In June, as a result of the negotiations, Bulgaria held its
first free elections in 58 years. Instead of solving the nation's
problems, however, the elections seemed to create more.
   The Communist Party, now called the Socialists, became unique
among former masters in the Soviet bloc by winning at the polls.
The stunned opposition Union of Democratic Forces accepted the
result, but has seemed unable to live with it.
   Little has been accomplished in the 400-seat Parliament, where
the former Communists have 211 members and the opposition alliance
144.
   It required six weeks for the assembly to chose a president,
former UDF leader Zhelyu Zhelev, and longer to approve an
all-Socialist government.
   Endless argument by deputies of the opposition alliance, and
divisions among the former Communists, have made it impossible to
pass legislation on foreign investment, selling state companies and
other economc and political reforms. UDF members refuse to support
Premier Andrei Lukanov or join a Socialist-led coalition.
   Although polls indicate the UDF would win if elections were held
now, many Bulgarians are critical of the opposition's conduct in
Parliament. Frustration, fear and tension have increased in the
streets.
   A mob burned the governing party's headquarters in September
after smashing windows and demanding the Communist red star be
removed from the roof.
   The charred walls and the empty mausoleum next door that once
housed the embalmed body of Communist founder Georgi Dmitrov -
removed and reburied in July - symbolize the collapse of Stalinism.
   Bulgaria's economy seems about to collapse with the old regime,
and Sofia is preparing for a bleak winter.
   Harvests were ruined by the driest summer in 32 years. Meat,
cheese, milk and even bread are rationed, and prices of available
goods rise steadily.
   Power cuts to factories and homes are routine. Industrial
production is down 30 percent from last year.
   Life is hardest for pensioners and the poor.
   ``These food lines, these prices; this is death for older
people,'' said Maria Ivanova, 64, waiting in a chill rain for a
store to open.
   ``We are eight people at home,'' said Stefka Savova, 61, who had
waited three hours to find only milk and rationed bread available.
``We have a 2-month-old baby there and they give us just five
cartons of milk. I don't have sausages, meat or cheese.''
   Mrs. Savova, a retired nurse with a monthly pension equivalent
to $14, said she had thought Zhivkov's fall was the beginning of a
brighter future.
   ``We expected things to get better, and they have gotten
worse,'' she said. ``I can do nothing ... only walk through the
streets and cry.''
   Legislators share the sense of helplessness.
   Parliament is ``incompetent and rather weak,'' said Dragomir
Draganov, a reform-minded deputy for the newly named Socialists.
   Instead of either uniting to govern or splitting into into
orthodox and reformist parties, he said, the Socialists have become
a deadlocked hybrid of Stalinists and Social Democrats.
   On the other side, the the 17-party Union of Democratic Forces
is united only in wanting the former Communists out of power.
   Political polarization and the coming winter ``create perfect
conditions for every populist,'' Draganov said, and a succesful one
``could liquidate even the small gains we have made on our way to
democracy.''
   Petyo Bluskov, editor of a new business-oriented weekly, 168
Hours, expressed the public impatience:
   ``What kind of moral respect can (deputies) win if they argue
for a week over what their salaries should be?'' he said.
   Opposition refusal to support the government's much-needed
economic reform program, or accept anything less than the
leadership of a coalition government, threatens to dash hopes of
economic recovery.
   Until the stalemate is resolved, foreigners have little reason
to invest in Bulgaria, a nation of 9 million with an obsolete
industrial plant that relied on now vanishing supplies from old
East European trading bloc.
   ``You know why you can't find beer in Bulgaria now?'' film
director Angel Wagenstein asked. ``Not because there is no beer.
Not because there are no bottles. We lack the tiny piece of plastic
inside the metal caps, which came from some other part of Eastern
Europe.''
   The Persian Gulf crisis has been a serious blow.
   Iraq used to pay installments of its $1.3 billion debt to
Bulgaria in oil. That has ceased and Soviet supplies, which must be
paid for with hard currency starting next year, are getting scarce.
   Bulgaria cannot afford to pay the higher prices on the orld oil
market, and stopped payments on its $11 billion foreign debt in
May. In September, international creditors agreed informally that
debt payment resume only late next year.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd is preparing to create a
royally appointed consultative assembly, edging the kingdom toward
greater democracy in a move clearly speeded by Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The king told newspaper editors in Jiddah on Thursday that he is
finalizing plans to set up the body to be known as the Shura
Council.
   Plans to set up the council first were discussed in the early
1960s. Successive Saudi monarchs repeatedly have delayed its
consideration, partly because of opposition by religious
conservatives.
   The ruling family even built an ornate building for the Shura
Council in the heart of Riyadh a decade ago. It has not been used.
   ``It pleases me that the final touches are being put on the
Shura Council and an announcement launching it will be made as soon
as the final formula is completed,'' Fahd said. Excerpts of his
statement were distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency.
   Although Fahd did not say so, the move to increase consultation
with the people was at least in part a response to the crisis
sparked off by the invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Crises provide the opportunity to do things you haven't been
able to do in the past,'' said Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert
at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   Ms. Kipper pointed to other signs of an opening in Saudi Arabia,
including the Saudis' allowing exiled Kuwaitis to discuss
democratic forms of government at a recent conference in the resort
town of Taif.
   ``That shows a kind of recognition of the new realities, the
tide of history, the changes in Eastern Europe, the elections in
Algeria, Tunisia and Jordan. These are things the people have been
asking for, and for a long time,'' she said.
   The demand for greater participation comes mainly from members
of the often Western-educated middle class who are impatient with a
system of governance that leaves much in the hands of the royal
family.
   The Shura Council, or Majlis al-Shura, is an appointed assembly
prescribed by the holy book of Islam to help rulers manage affairs
of state. It comprises mostly loyalist politicians and scholars.
   Fahd stressed that the kingdom has always been ruled by the
tenets of Islam that underscore ``the principle of consultations in
all matters.''
   He said that the foundation of the Shura Council was laid down
by his warrior-statesman father, the late King Abdel-Aziz, who
founded Saudi Arabia in 1927.
   A representative body of local elders advised the royal family
during the 1930s in the Hijaz, the country's Red Sea province. This
local body gradually ceased to function, but the idea resurfaced
during a power tussle between liberal younger princes and King Saud
in the early 1960s.
   When Saud's power-behind-the-throne, Prince Faisal, formed a new
government in 1962 he issued a 10-point program that included the
future establishment of a consultative council.
   But after he became king, Faisal took no concrete steps toward
implementing the proposed Majlis al-Shura.
   Shortly after Faisal's assassination in 1975, King Khaled
announced that his government felt bound to complete the
consultative council project.
   But the subject was not broached again in public until 1980,
after the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca and Shiite riots in
the oil-rich Eastern Province.
   Fahd did not mention the proposals after Khaled's death in 1982,
leading some analysts to observe that democracy was only discussed
at times of crisis for the ruling family.
   Kuwait was the only conservative Persian Gulf state to boast a
Western-style elected parliament. That parliament was twice
dissolved in a decade.
   A temporary assembly was elected in Kuwait last summer but
crumbled under the impact of the Iraqi invasion.
   Other gulf states such as Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
Emirates have their own Shura Councils.

<HEAD>Artist, Lauded As Top Portrait Painter, Is Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Painter Rodrigo Moynihan, hailed by art critics as
one of the century's leading portraitists, has died. He was 80.
   Moynihan, who died Tuesday in London, painted the future Queen
Elizabeth II in 1946 and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1983.
However, art critics say many of his best portraits were of fellow
painters like Francis Bacon, William Coldstream, Victor Pasmore and
Victor Willing.
   Though art critics praised him especially for his portraits, his
work varied widely - from abstract expressionism to naturalism -
during his career spanning nearly 60 years.
   Moynihan was born in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Spanish
Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa in 1910.
   He came to Britain in 1918 and was educated at London's
University College School. From 1924 to 1927, he went to high
school in Madison, N.J. He returned to Europe in 1928.
   Early in his career, he evolved a form of abstract
expressionism. He began exhibiting with what was known as the
London Group of artists in 1932 and emerged as a leader of another
coterie called the Objective Abstractions Group.
   He later returned to a more naturalistic style and in 1937
became associated with Coldstream, Pasmore and Claude Rogers.
   During World War II, Moynihan became a government war artist.
His poignant ``Private Clark, ATS'' (Auxiliary Territorial Service)
and the grim indignities he depicted in ``The Medical Inspection''
proved enduring images of the period.
   In 1956, he moved from painting naturalistic landscapes and
group portraits to non-figurative art. In another shift, he then
moved into what became known as ``hard-edge'' abstraction.
   His 11-foot-long painting ``The Teaching Staff of the Painting
School, Royal College of Art,'' finished in 1950, was hailed as the
grandest group portrait of his times. It now hangs in London's Tate
Gallery.
   Warm, gregarious, of stocky build, a lover of gossip and a
voracious reader, Moynihan was professor of painting at London's
Royal College of Art from 1948 to 1957.
   From 1963 to 1968, he was joint editor with his second wife Anne
Dunn, John Ashbery and Sonia Orwell of the magazine ``Art and
Literature'' published in Paris.
   His book ``Goya,'' about the Spanish painter who died in 1828,
was published in 1951.
   In 1931, he married Elinor Bellingham Smith, then a fellow
student at the Slade School of Art. She became a well known painter
in her own right. The marriage ended in divorce and she died in
1988. The couple had one son.
   In 1960, Moynihan married his second wife. The couple, who had a
son, lived in Provence in southern France. That marriage also ended
in divorce.

   Here is a breakdown of the opposing forces gathered in the
Persian Gulf.
   UNITED STATES - Officials say about 230,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the gulf region, and at least 100,000
more could be sent.
   Ground forces in Saudi Arabia include the 82nd ``All American''
Airborne Division; the 101st ``Screaming Eagles'' Airborne
Division; the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, with about 200 M-1
Abrams tanks and 300 Bradley Fighting Vehicles; the 11th Air
Defense Artillery Brigade; 197th Mechanized Infantry Brigade; the
1st Cavalry Division and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   Amphibious capability is provided by 45,000 men of the 1st, 4th
and 6th Marine Expeditionary Brigades. There is a Special Forces
contingent from the 1st Special Operations Command.
   
   The U.S. fleet in the gulf, the Arabian Sea and the eastern
Mediterranean totals about 55 ships. They include the aircraft
carriers Independence, Saratoga and John F. Kennedy; the battleship
Wisconsin with 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles, five missile cruisers,
four destroyers, several frigates, plus supply ships and six to
eight nuclear submarines.
   The aircraft carriers have a combined strike force of 180 A-6
Intruder fighters, F/A-18 Hornet fighters and F-14 Tomcats. The
Marines have about 60 AV-8B Harrier jump-jets.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 F117A Stealth fighter-bombers to
unspecified bases; 14 long-range F-111F bombers to Incirlik airbase
in southwest Turkey, and another squadron to Spain.
   There are an estimated 150 F-16s and F-15s; more than 70 A-10
tank-killing Thunderbolts, and unspecified numbers of F-4 Wild
Weasel air-defense suppression jets and other combat aircraft
deployed at 30 airbases in the region.
   A squadron of 6-8 B-52G strtegic bombers is on the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia.
   ---
   BRITAIN - A three-ship flotilla permanently stationed in the
gulf has been beefed up to 12 ships, including a missile destroyer,
two missile frigates and three minesweepers. They have support
ships.
   Four squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar interceptors and ground
attack jets are in Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman. Three Nimrod
maritime reconnaissance aircraft are in Oman.
   The 7th Armored Brigade, successors to the famous ``Desert
Rats'' of World War II, have started arriving with 120 Challenger
tanks and 9,500 troops in Britain's biggest military operation
since the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina. British troop
strength is expected to reach 15,000.
   ---
   FRANCE - It has about 14 ships and 13,000 troops in the gulf
region. The warships include a guided-missile cruiser, two missile
destroyers, two frigates and one corvette with support vessels.
   France is sending three squadrons of interceptors and
fighter-bombers. The 4,000-troop Rapid Action Force is deployed
with Arab forces in Saudi Arabia's northeastern desert. It includes
the 5th Combat Helicopter Regiment with 42 gunships; the Foreign
Legion's 3nd Infantry Regiment with anti-tank missiles; the 1st
Spahis Cavalry Regiment with armored vehicles, and an anti-aircraft
missile unit.
   A company of 190 paratroopers equipped for chemical warfare is
in the United Arab Emirates.
   The French deployment is the nation's biggest overseas operation
since the Algerian war in the early 1960s.
   ---
   ITALY - The frigates Libeccio, Orsa and Zeffiro and a support
ship, the Stromboli, are in the gulf. The corvettes Minerva and
Stinge are in the eastern Mediterranean replacing U.S. units
assigned to the gulf.
   A squadron of eight Tornado fighters is based near Abu Dhabi,
United Arab Emirates, to provide air cover for Italian warships. No
ground force deployment is planned.
   ---
   CANADA - The destroyers Athabaskan and Terra Nova and the supply
ship Protecteur are heading for the gulf. A squadron of 18 CF-18
fighter jets and 450 military personnel based in West Germany are
in Saudi Arabia.
   ---

100-man army unit will also be sent.
   ---
   SOVIET UNION - The Udaloy-class destroyer Admiral Tributs and an
anti-submarine ship are in the Gulf of Oman. Moscow has indicated
it would send ground forces, but only under U.N. command. The
Slava-class missile cruiser Chervona Ukraina and the
Sovremenny-class destroyer Bystry passed through the Suez Canal
Oct.4, ostensibly en route to join the Soviet Pacific Fleet. But
they could be deployed in the gulf region.
   ---
   GREECE - Greece has sent its most advanced frigate, the Limnos,
to the eastern Mediterranean. Greece is supplying merchant ships
for the U.S. sealift.
   ---

   GULF COOPERATION COUNCIL (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, United
Arab Emirates, Qatar and, until Aug. 2, Kuwait) - A rapid
deployment force of up to 10,000 troops is based at Hafr al-Batin,
Saudi Arabia, 40 miles south of the Kuwait border. They and allied
Arab-Islamic forces form the first line of defense.
   The GCC force has been beefed up with about 7,000 soldiers of
Kuwait's 20,000-man army who escaped their country when Iraq
invaded. Most of their heavy weapons were captured by Iraq, but
some combat jets and tanks were saved. The GCC and other Gulf Arab
forces total around 144,500 men, 330 combat aircraft, 800 tanks and
36 major naval units.
   They are supported by:
   EGYPT - It has pledged up to 20,000 troops with tanks and heavy
artillery. About 14,000 troops - including paratroopers, commandos,
chemical warfare specialists and infantry - are in Saudi Arabia.
Several thousand more soldiers from the 3rd Armored Division and
the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division, are expected soon. Five
hundred troops are in the United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   SYRIA - About 6,500 troops, mostly elite Special Forces units
who have fought the Israelis and others in Lebanon, are in Saudi
Arabia. A 15,000-man armored division, with about 420 tanks and
heavy artillery, is also arriving. Some troops are based in the
United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   PAKISTAN - It has pledged to send 5,000 troops, with 2,000
already in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 in the United Arab Emirates,
along with 1,000 advisers. About 5,000 advisers are already
attached to the Saudi armed forces.
   ---
   MOROCCO - It has 1,200 troops in Saudi Arabia and 500 in the
United Arab Emirates.
   ---
   BANGLADESH - It has 2,000 troops, including engineering and
infantry units, in Saudi Arabia.
   ---
   IRAQ - The army has seven corps totaling 55 divisions. There are
555,000 regular troops and 480,000 reserves. Regular forces include
seven divisions of elite Republican Guards.
   Iraq claims a militia called the Popular Army has 5 million men.
   Saddam Hussein has 5,500 tanks, including about 500 high-quality
T-72s and 1,000 medium-quality T-62s; 3,500 artillery guns; 200
multiple rocket launchers; an estimated 500 surface-to-surface
missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; 500-plus combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors. The equipment is spread around an estimated 25
airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divisions, four of them
armored, totaling 170,000 troops; 3,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks, and
1,700 artillery pieces in what appear to be defensive positions.
   About 250,000 men, including the seven Republican Guard
divisions with up to 1,300 tanks and 750 guns, are in southern Iraq
as a tactical reserve. Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to
have been deployed to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in
Kuwait. FROG-7 battlefield missiles have also been deployed,
including batteries captured in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Wall Art Lasts in Berlin, May Travel the World</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bulldozers will be chewing up the Berlin Wall for
months to come, but if a group of artists has its way, sections of
the old Cold War barrier will travel the world to be exhibited as
murals.
   A year after the wall was opened last Nov. 9 and astounded the
world, one of the most prominent stretches still standing is
decorated with 90 huge paintings, each about 50 feet long and 11{
feet tall.
   The East Side Gallery, as the display of wall paintings is
called, sprang into being last January and the final painting was
finished in October. The work of German artist Georg-Lutz
Rauschebart, it shows Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev turning
the Communist hammer-and-sickle symbol upside down and parting the
wall.
   Several Russian artists are represented. One by Dmitri Vrubel is
a pensive portrait of the late Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet
dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner, labeled simply ``Thanks.''
   An impressionistic turmoil of blue and yellow on a black
background by Japanese artist Kikue Miyatake is titled ``Paradise
out of Darkness.''
   Some paintings are cartoons, some are political satire, many are
on environmental topics or on the theme of division - the message
that the Berlin Wall stood for in its 28 years separating West
Berlin from its surroundings in Communist East Germany.
   The paintings stretch for 4,491 feet along Muehlen Street in the
former East Berlin. The gray back of the wall facing the Spree
River has signs beckoning visitors to come over and see the
political art, and buy posters, T-shirts and postcards.
   ``We know only that we can stay until the end of March,'' said
Annett Tyra, who operates the gallery shop. ``Everything else is
quite uncertain.''
   The artists behind the venture hope to take a few representative
sections of the wall - each weighing several tons - to New York,
Japan and elsewhere to be exhibited, Ms. Tyra said, but sponsorship
money was still to be raised.
   An East Berliner, Ms. Tyra said the wall stood right next to her
house and she had long accepted it as a ``terrible normality.''
   When the beleaguered East German Communist government bowed to a
popular revolution and ended travel restrictions last Nov. 9, in
effect dooming the wall, Ms. Tyra said, ``I had to pinch myself to
make sure I wasn't dreaming.''
   A year later, she finds East Berliners show little interest in
the wall gallery and also are not as idealistic about the future as
she had hoped.
   ``People are forgetting the ideals and thinking only of cars and
money,'' she said. ``We need to remember the background and the
reasons for this. We see only foreigners and West Berliners coming
to see the paintings.''
   Petra Reetz, spokeswoman for the office demolishing the wall
inside Berlin, said she expected the East Side Gallery wall
sections could continue to stand. She said 81 percent of the
downtown wall had been taken down as of the end of October, leaving
only 2.1 miles standing within the city.
   Authorities are making slower progress in dismantling the 81
miles of wall that stood on the rural side of West Berlin.

<HEAD>That No-New-Tax Thing: This Time Bush Says He Really Means It</HEAD>

   Forget his lips. This time any tax increase
will come ``over my dead veto,'' says George Bush, demonstrating
anew his knack for anti-tax phrasemaking.
   But is it either good politics or good policy?
   Bush felt a need to back away from his hard-line opposition to
taxes last spring when he entered budget negotiations with
Congress. As policy, ``read my lips'' was not working.
   But as politics, the hard-line opposition to taxes had worked to
perfection in 1988. Understandably, Republicans who thought it
would work as well for them in 1990 were angry and frustrated by
his retreat.
   Then came his first public comment on the mid-term elections in
which Republicans lost one Senate seat and nine in the House.
Abruptly, and to the astonishment of many fellow Republicans, Bush
rejoined the anti-tax ranks.
   His timing was puzzling. Congress is not in session and won't be
until January. No one is going to be rushing into the Oval Office
with a tax bill and demanding he sign it.
   His declaration sounded more like politics than policy, more
like his statement of where he wanted to be in his 1992 re-election
campaign.
   Republicans who'd never abandoned the tax gospel did not welcome
Bush back.
   ``Who's he kidding?'' asked Lyn Nofziger, White House political
director under Ronald Reagan. ``He's got a terrible problem. He's
got to re-establish his credibility, because at this moment he has
none.''
   ``Flip, flop, flip,'' was the reaction of a Republican operative
who insisted on ridiculing his president anonymously.
   Never mind the poll numbers that have dropped but still show
Bush looking strong for a president at mid-term. A better measure
of Bush's political difficulty is the willingness of Republicans to
speak out, unafraid of any potential presidential punishment.
   Two weeks before Tuesday's 1990 elections, Bush got into a flap
with Edward J. Rollins, the co-chairman of the House Republican
Campaign Committee. Rollins had written a memo advising GOP
candidates who disagreed with the president on taxes to go their
own way on the issue.
   Bush was furious. He made it clear he wanted Rollins fired.
Rollins still has his job and the support of House Republicans.
   Undoubtedly, if the president is determined to get rid of
Rollins, he can do it. But the image of the president of the United
States having to exert himself to dump a political employee of one
of his party's campaign committees is hardly a sign of strength.
   Tuesday was a worrisome day for people who have to ask voters to
pay more taxes. That was why governors were among the hardest hit.
   Pollster Mark Mellman said, ``If you look at the candidates who
were defeated, in state after state, governors who raised taxes or
whose party raised taxes were defeated.''
   The president said he got the message. ``I think people feel
they're taxed too much,'' he said.
   Once again, he evoked the image of congressional Democrats
demanding that he raise taxes. ``And they're going to do it over my
dead veto - or live veto, or something like that, because it ain't
going to happen, I'll guarantee you,'' said Bush.
   That guarantee must sound a little hollow to Bill Schuette of
Michigan, LynnMartin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of Rhode
Island. All are Republican members of the House who made tax
opposition the centerpiece of their challenges to Democratic
senators.
   They'd seen Bush's success in 1988 when he was elected president
after telling the nation, ``Read my lips, no new taxes.''
   But this was 1990 and taxes suddenly appeared on the White House
table. In the election, Schuette, Martin and Schneider were wiped
out. Sen. Paul Simon beat Martin by 30 percentage points; Sen.
Claiborne Pell topped Schneider by 24 points; Sen. Carl Levin
outpolled Schuette by 16.

<TEXT>
   The assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane has
brought out the ambivalence many Israelis feel toward the man who
gave political shape to anti-Arab racism.
   It was best reflected by the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, which
banished Kahane for his extremist views, but honored his memory
with a customary minute of silence.
   Kahane, 58, was shot in the neck Monday following a speech in
New York. El Sayyid A. Nosair, 34, was captured after a shootout
with a U.S. Postal Service police officer. He was arraigned on
murder charges at his hospital bed on Wednesday.
   Part of the mixed response to Kahane stems from the tradition of
not speaking ill of the dead. Thus Kahane's eulogists, most of whom
shunned and despised his politics, are choosing to dwell on less
controversial qualities, such as his charity work, his Jewish
Defense League's efforts to protect American Jews and his campaigns
on behalf of Soviet Jewry.
   But few can ignore his blatant anti-Arab preachings and their
strong overtones of violence.
   Hanan Porat, a right-wing religious legislator, observed during
a Knesset discussion of Kahane's murder that it was customary to
refer to the dead as holy.
   ``All the same, I confess that it is not easy for me to talk
about Rabbi Meir Kahane, blessed be his memory, as holy,'' Porat
said.
   Kahane was a provocative figure from the day he immigrated to
Israel in 1971.
   Most Israelis blanched at his calls for the expulsion of Arabs
under Israeli rule.
   His harsh interpretations of Jewish law went as far as to seek
legislation banning sex between Jews and Arabs. His eye-for-an-eye
doctrine of vengeance - often against randomly chosen Arab targets
- was unpalatable to most.
   His American accent marked him as an outsider.
   He was ``a foreign implantation. He didn't acclimatize. He
didn't have roots in the political Zionist sense. He didn't fit
in,'' said Geula Cohen, a right-wing legislator who knew him.
   The Israeli media tried to ignore him except when his small band
of followers attacked and sometimes killed Palestinians. Most
Israelis felts his aggressive Jewish Defense League tactics had no
place in a country with an effective army and police force.
   His first two runs for Parliament were abject failures.
   He finally was elected in 1984, but whenever he rose to speak
most members would leave the chamber in protest, and they prevented
his re-election in 1988 by outlawing racist candidates.
   But two Cabinet ministers went to his funeral, along with the
chief Sephardic rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu.
   Eliahu appealed to the mourners to leave the vengeance to God.
Yet hundreds of Kahane disciples rampaged through Jerusalem
attacking Arabs, journalists and ``leftists.''
   Columnist Yosef Goell wrote in The Jerusalem Post that when he
heard an Israel radio announcer refer to ``Kahane, of blessed
memory,'' a common Hebrew appellation for the dead, ``I choked on
my morning coffee.''
   He said the Knesset members who honored Kahane's memory, ``were
chipping away at the red lines which are so essential in isolating
the main body of the people from the psychotic margins.''
   The mixed reactions to Kahane may be explained by the fact
Kahane articulated the gut fears of many Israelis, especially amid
Arab-Jewish clashes following the killing of 20 Palestinians last
month on Jerusalem's Temple Mount.
   While most Israelis might balk at expelling the Arabs, they
certainly worry about how to escape being submerged by the faster
Arab birthrate.
   In the daily Maariv newspaper, columnist Dov Goldstein suggested
that it's ``an open secret ... (that) in the hearts of many
ordinary Israeli citizens hides a not-so-little Kahane.''
   Ron Kronish of the American-Jewish Committee, which works for
better inter-communal relations in the United States and Israel,
saw one good thing emerging from Kahane's legacy: a mushrooming of
institutes in Israel dedicated to countering ``Kahanism'' by
fostering civil liberties and pluralism.
   Kahane was elected with more than 20,000 votes in 1984, and
polls predicted he would have tripled his vote had he been allowed
to run in 1988.
   Professor Yitzhak Galnur of the Hebrew University believed
Kahane's Kach party would dwindle, mainly because it is being
supplanted by home-grown substitutes. One such group is the Moledet
(Homeland) party, led by a retired Sabra general, which advocates
the expulsion of the Arabs.
   ``It is much harder for me to fight racism without Kahane,
because he was a clear address,'' Galnur says. ``The substitutes
are more legitimate and local, as it were, and therefore it is much
harder to fight them.''

<HEAD>Met Presents Season's First `Traviata'</HEAD>

   The big Franco Zeffirelli production of Verdi's
``La Traviata'' was new in October of last year, so many in the
audience at the first presentation this season hadn't seen it.
   They applauded the second act scenery, a sun room in a country
house near Paris, and the dance entertainment - especially dancers
Kyra Nichols and Fernando Bujones - in the party scene that
followed.
   The singing Thursday night did not inspire wild applause or make
one forget great performances in the opera heard previously.
   Tenor Jerry Hadley, as Alfredo, came off best, sounding sincere
telling Violetta he loves her in Act 1 and vigorously denouncing
her in the party scene.
   In Act 1, Marilyn Mims had a ``grand prima donna'' tone without
 voice good enough to back that up. She was definitely best when
singing softly, in much of Act 2 with Alfredo's father, the elder
Germont, and in the final act, in her deathbed reunion with
Alfredo. Her final outburst, just before Violetta's death, was
beautifully sung and involved the audience emotionally for the
first time.
   Juan Pons sang the Elder Germont. His singing seems to be
produced at the back of his throat. Maybe he was tired. He has sung
at the Met four times previously in the past two weeks, in ``A
Masked Ball.''
   Rico Saccani conducted knowledgeably except that orchestra
volume seemed up for the quietest act, the last.
   Suzanna Guzman, a native of Los Angeles, made her Met debut in
the small role of Violetta's friend Flora. She sang with the Met in
city parks last summer, has sung opera in Washington D.C., San
Diego, Los Angeles and Anchorage.
   Zeffirelli gives Act 1 two parlor and two bedroom scenes. That
seems less objectionable than before on second viewing.
   What is just as annoying is his having principal characters
enter mingling with crowds. When the Elder Germont arrives at the
party, just after his son throws money at Violetta to humiliate
her, it should be a shock to see this authority figure appear. And
it would have impact, if he had some space around him so we could
see who it was.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Using Force in the Gulf - Is Bush Serious?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid all the administration buildup and
bluster about going after Saddam Hussein militarily, a question
lingers: Do they really mean it?
   The question is relevant because a military strike against Iraq
was not what the American people had bargained for when U.S. forces
were first sent to the region.
   President Bush said initially these forces were sent on a
``defensive'' mission to protect Saudi Arabia. Later, after the
United Nations embargo was implemented, Bush raised the stakes by
saying the U.S. goal in the Persian Gulf was to force Iraq out of
Kuwait through a policy of economic denial.
   Lately, however, the rhetoric has changed. Not much is being
said about defending Saudi Arabia or starving Iraq out of Kuwait. A
lot is being said about using force, and Bush on Thursday approved
a substantial increase in the U.S. troop commitment to ensure ``an
adequate offensive military option'' is available. A defensive
force has been transformed into an offensive option.
   Bush says he's ``had it'' with Saddam. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III has been rattling sabres almost daily. There is talk
of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force.
   In August, people gasped when administration officials said
50,000 American troops might be dispatched to the gulf. Now the
numbers are well over 200,000 and rising.
   The administration, with the help of its coalition partners,
wants Saddam to believe his only alternative to withdrawal from
Kuwait is annihilation.
   ``I would like to see a peaceful solution to this question,''
Bush said Thursday. ``If this movement of force is what convinces
him, so much the better.''
   As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger used to say, a
military presence does no good if the enemy thinks it's not going
to be used. Well, the United States used force in Grenada in 1983,
in Libya in 1986 and in Panama in 1989.
   Do those precedents impress Saddam? Only he knows. Maybe the
addition of three armored divisions from Germany and one from the
United States to the existing force in Saudi Arabia will help him
make up his mind.
   From Bush's perspective, there are powerful arguments for giving
the sanctions more time to work. There was never the slightest
intimation by the administration at the outset that the sanctions
would force Saddam's hand within 100 days of his invasion of Kuwait
- a milestone which will be reached this weekend. So what's the
hurry?
   Beyond that, Bush and Baker are fully aware of how military
adventurism wrecked Lyndon Johnson's presidency a generation ago.
Johnson campaigned on a peace platform in 1964, then escalated U.S.
involvement in Vietnam quickly after his inauguration.
   As U.S. casualties mounted, Johnson's mandate disappeared, and
the Democratic Party has never recovered from that debacle. It has
lost five of the last six presidential elections after winning
seven of the preceding nine.
   The current tolerant public mood toward Bush's gulf policy could
change dramatically if Bush goes to war without satisfying the
American people that peaceful alternatives had been exhausted.
   If an armed conflict produces casualties perceived by the public
as unacceptably high and also sends oil prices shooting through the
ceiling, some analysts believe Bush could turn out to be a one-term
president.
   While assuming a more pugnacious public posture, Bush and Baker
continue to say their goal is a peaceful solution. They hope that
Saddam, faced with the spectre of empty shelves in Iraqi markets
and one of the most awesome concentrations of military power ever
assembled, will conclude that his best bet is to cut his losses by
calling it quits in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Navy May Mothball Two Remaining Battleships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy is considering mothballing its last
two active battleships, vessels whose reputations were tarnished
two years ago by the USS Iowa explosion that killed 47 sailors.
   The commander of Naval Sea Systems Command told Congress of the
possible action Thursday shortly after congressional investigators
recommended that the Navy decommission the USS Missouri and the USS
Wisconsin.
   ``I can tell you that it is under discussion,'' said Vice Adm.
Peter M. Hekman Jr.
   The Wisconsin is in the Persian Gulf as part of the U.S.
military buildup there. The Missouri has been conducting exercises
off San Clemente Island in the Pacific Ocean, and also will be sent
to the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney should mothball the
last two battleships unless ``Middle East operations convincingly
demonstrate their unique utility.''
   The GAO said the battleships' 16-inch guns have a maximum range
of over 23 miles, which limits the vessels' ability to provide
effective surface fire support.
   In addition, the operating cost of one battleship is $58 million
a year and the vessels require a crew of about 1,500 compared with
about 360 seamen for an Aegis guidance missile cruiser.
   During the Reagan administration's military buildup in the
1980s, the Navy, at a cost of $2 billion, recommissioned four
battleships that had been in mothballs since the 1950s.
   The USS New Jersey, one of the four, had previously been briefly
reactivated in the late 1960s and served off Vietnam.
   The Pentagon cited budgetary problems in deciding to
decommission the New Jersey and the USS Iowa - the latter the site
of one of the nation's worst naval disasters. The Iowa was taken
out of service last month and the New Jersey will return to
mothballs in February.
   On April 19, 1989, an explosion in gun turret No. 2 of the Iowa
claimed the lives of 47 seaman, including Gunner's Mate Clayton
Hartwig, whom the Navy said probably set off the blast.
   In September 1989, the service contended in a report that the
sailor likely inserted a chemical detonator between bags of powder
in one of the warship's 16-inch guns to commit suicide.
   But last May, a new investigation concluded that the explosion
may well have been an accident, caused by unintentionally ramming
gunpowder bags too hard and too far into the barrel.
   The new findings by scientists at the Sandia National
Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., prompted the Navy to reopen the
investigation and halt the firing of the 16-inch guns aboard the
battleships.
   The service rescinded its order on the firings when it sent the
Wisconsin to the Persian Gulf area in August but only after
limiting the battleship to use propellant charges that have no top
layer, where the accidental blast could occur.
   The House hearing broke no new ground on the Iowa blast as GAO
witnesses and officials from Sandia repeated the testimony they
provided Congress in May.
   The economic stabilization subcommittee of the House Banking,
Finance and Urban Affairs Committee held the hearing.
   The subcommittee is not normally involved with Navy matters, but
Hartwig's family lives in the district of the panel's chairwoman,
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio. Members of the family attended the
hearing.

   Despite the Pentagon's efforts to keep U.S.
troop locations in the Persian Gulf secret, commercial satellite
companies are selling photographs that could provide military
details of the area.
   Pictures made available by Soyuzkarta, a Soviet trade
organization, ``are among the finest unclassified imagery I have
ever seen,'' said Peter Zimmerman, a professor of applied sciences
at George Washington University here.
   Soyuzkarta is one of three commercial firms that sell satellite
photographs of the gulf. The other two are SPOT Image, a
French-owned company and Landsat, a U.S. concern.
   SPOT Image says it will sell pictures only to people with
security clearances to prevent the images from falling into Iraqi
hands; Landsat says its pictures of the gulf region show only sand;
Soyuzkarta says it tries to make sure only legitimate customers buy
the pictures.
   Soyuzkarta, which uses cameras aboard a satellite, provides
photographs with higher resolution than the pictures provided by
the other companies, analysts say.
   The Soyuzkarta pictures show items roughly 15 feet in size. With
computer enhancement, the images are clearer.
   Zimmerman, who has seen some of the Soyuzkarta film, said one
could likely see the placement of large vehicles, the site of a
troop deployment and topological details such as trenches if the
camera were focused on an area. Individual people would be
indistinguishable.
   The pictures ``would be very useful'' for Iraqi and U.S. forces
in the gulf to help determine military information about the other
side, Zimmerman said.
   But Jeffrey Richelson, author of ``America's Secret Eyes In
Space,'' said a skilled photo interpreter is often needed to
identify objects from satellite pictures.
   Citing security precautions, Defense Department officials have
gone to great lengths to conceal the exact location of the
approximately 230,000 U.S. troops stationed in and around Saudi
Arabia.
   Journalists are barred from taking pictures containing
identifiable features and from using specific datelines in their
stories.
   Rick Obern, a Defense Department spokesman, said he had not seen
the commercial satellite pictures but they would be a concern if
they revealed operational information. He said he knew of no
attempts to block the sale of the photos.
   Velon Minshew of Fort Worth, Texas, a U.S. distributor for
Soyuzkarta, said the company has pictures of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Iraq for the months of August and September. The satellite
orbits the Earth every two weeks.
   Each frame showing an area 50-60 miles sells for $1,560.
   Minshew refused to say who has purchased the pictures, but the
company will sell to legitimate organizations who agree not to
transfer the information, he said. Sanctions imposed by the United
Nations bar the sale of material to Iraq.
   ``We are careful who buys the data,'' Minshew said.
   Clark Nelson of SPOT Image said his company sells photographs to
the Defense Department. ``We are not selling to the Iraqis or
anybody associated with the Iraqis,'' he said, and only those with
``proper security procedures'' are allowed to purchase the
pictures.
   The Washington Times reported recently that Iraq has obtained
satellite pictures indirectly from SPOT Image. Nelson said he had
no knowledge of the story.
   Nelson said SPOT Image's pictures show a resolution of about 30
feet. The pictures sell for anywhere from $500 to $3,000.
   Landsat's pictures are available to anyone wanting them,
according to Dick Mroczynski, a company spokesman.
   Generally, the Landsat pictures of the gulf region show ``a lot
of sand,'' he said. The definition of the pictures is much less
clear than in those sold by Soyuzkarta and SPOT Image, he said.
   Landsat's pictures were designed as a mapping tool, and are
often used by geologists and others trying to determine land
formations.
   Television networks have not made wide use of the satellite
pictures, although CBS' ``60 Minutes'' program showed a photograph
purporting to show a uranium mine in Iraq. An interpreter pointed
out the images.
   Spokesmen for CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN said they networks were not
using other gulf pictures.
   John Stack, the foreign assignment editor at NBC, said the
network has used satellite pictures in the past to show, among
other things, the nuclear explosion at Chernobyl in the Soviet
Union.
   Electronic images provided by commercial satellites are not
nearly as sophisticated as the data sent by intelligence
satellites, Richelson said.

<HEAD>Female Choice of Long Fins May Have Shaped Fish Species, Researcher
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female platyfish looking for a male in her
life will always choose a guy with a long sporty tail fin,
according to research published today.
   That bias, says Alexandra L. Basolo, a researcher at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, could have led to the
evolution of a related fish species called the swordtail.
   Basolo says she proved female platyfish prefer long-finned
fellows by sewing fake plastic fins, called swords, on the
shortailed platy males.
   The females went for the guys with sword fins every time, she
said, but just why is still not clear.
   ``It could be as simple as the fact that females have a
preference for a novel male, something new, that they've never seen
before,'' Basolo said in a telephone interview.
   Whatever the reason, such a mating bias by the female can
dramatically change the appearance of a species over many
generations, said the researcher.
   Platyfish and swordtails come from an ancestral stock, the genus
known as Xiphophorus, that is swordless. Species in the genus all
live in freshwater streams in Central America. Some are popular
aquarium pets and are raised commercially.
   Basolo said some evolutionary process occurred to cause the male
swordtail to develop the distinctive thornlike projection that
extends downward from the bottom of the tailfin. Male platyfish,
though related, have no swords.
   Yet, for some reason, the female platyfish seems to like guys
with swords.
   No obvious use or advantage has been found for the sword, said
Basolo. The male swordtails develop the elongated tail only at
mating age.
   Basolo said that in earlier research she proved female
swordtails will usually select the males with the most impressive
swords.
   To test if the female platyfish had the same bias, Basolo
selected pairs of male, swordless platyfish that were matched in
size and color. Then, on one male in each pair she surgically
implanted a plastic sword that resembled the size and color of the
natural swords on swordtails.
   On the other male in the pair, she implanted a transparent sword
matched in size. Earlier studies had shown that this clear plastic
sword could not be detected by the female platyfish. Basolo said
the transparent sword was used to make certain the test was not
biased by the surgical procedure or by the effect of the sword on
the male's movements in the water. This assured that the only
obvious difference seen from the female point of view would be the
prominent, colored sword, she said.
   A three-chambered aquarium was used for the test. One male was
placed in each of the two end chambers, and a female was placed in
the center chamber. She was able to see both males and could
choose. During the test period, the males and females actively
courted each other, even though they were separated by clear
plastic chamber walls. Six pairs of males were tested with 9 to 16
females each and a record was kept of the courting selections the
females made.
   ``Given a choice between one of her own males with a sword and
one of her own males with no apparent sword, the female platyfish
prefers males with a sword,'' said Basolo. It supports the
suggestion that female selection, thousands of generations ago,
could have led to development of the swordtail species, said the
researcher.
   ``If females preferentially mated with those males with swords,
then over time the trait would become fixed and all males would
have it,'' she said.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two entrepreneurs hope to make their mark in the
future with a business from the past.
   Mark Kominkiewicz and Paul Yeh have left behind their jobs in
the world of computers to become milkmen.
   This week their Lincoln Park Dairy Service began making
deliveries in a square-mile area with about 46,000 apartments and
condos near the affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood. They've signed
up more than 50 customers to start.
   ``The decade of the 90s is a service-oriented era,''
Kominkiewicz said. ``And we thought that this was a market that
definitely could be tapped.
   ``People like things delivered to their doors,'' he added. ``You
got diapers, you got pizza, you got groceries, and now we're
bringing back milk.''
   Kominkiewicz, 25, an account manager at a computer firm, and
Yeh, 26, a financial analyst there, quit their jobs and formed the
company two months ago.
   They began deliveries before dawn Monday. Kominkiewicz' workday
now will start at 2:30 a.m., when he picks up the milk. Deliveries
are between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. The company also carries juice and
other dairy products.
   Kominkiewicz said people who responded to their newspaper ads
and fliers were lured by nostalgia or concern for the environment.
   ``People remember how much better milk tastes from a glass
bottle,'' he said. ``They don't get that cardboard or plastic
taste. They also don't have to worry about what to do with the
glass containers because we collect them when they're empty and
recycle them.''
   The era of home milk delivery gradually began to end more than
two decades ago, said Bob Garfield, director of technical services
for the Washington-based International Dairy Foods Association.
   Customers found it cheaper and just as convenient to buy milk at
grocery stores, and now less than 1 percent of milk sales are from
home deliveries, Garfield said by telephone.
   ``But there is a small niche of customers who can afford to pay
more and like the idea of buying milk in glass, reusable bottles,''
he said.
   Kominkiewicz expects his business to expand quickly and branch
out to more Chicago neighborhoods. ``It's not like you're dealing
with a small town or suburb that only has 10 houses on the block,''
he said.
   By the end of 1991 he and Yeh hope to have 1,600 customers.
   ``These people will come to rely on me as their milkman,''
Kominkiewicz said. ``They'll see the same face at the door every
day. It won't be like it is at the supermarket, where they're only
dealing with a name tag.''

   Dismissing influenza as an inevitable risk of
winter could be a fatal mistake, say doctors who warn that flu
kills an average of 20,000 Americans a year.
   ``The reason people die from the flu is it hits the body so
hard,'' said Dr. John D. Nicolas, a clinical medicine instructor at
Northwestern University and head of a seminar Thursday on
prevention of colds and flu.
   ``The most common misconception is, it's not serious,'' said Dr.
Walter Gunn, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.
   Most who succumb are elderly or people with chronic health
problems. They should be vaccinated now to be ready for the flu
season, usually beginning in December. In some years flu claims
twice or more the annual rate of 20,000.
   ``Because of people getting together for the Thanskgiving
holiday, traveling from other places, spending a few days together
inside the house, that's a perfect environment for spreading the
virus around,'' said Mary Huck, spokeswoman for the Illinois
Department of Public Health.
   Flu, or influenza, is spread by virus-infected droplets coughed
or sneezed into the air. Victims develop fever, headache, muscle
ache and fatigue.
   The vaccine is effective in 70 percent to 90 percent of people
under 65 and about half the people over 65, Gunn said. It can
protect 85 percent of the elderly from dying of flu or its
complications because its symptoms will be milder even if they
catch it after getting the vaccine, he said.
   Yet only 30 percent to 40 percent of high-risk people get
immunized, he said, possibly because they fear becoming infected
from the vaccine.
   ``You can't get flu from the shot. The virus (in it) has been
killed,'' Gunn said.
   The vaccine protects against the three strains of flu that
health authorities have guessed will be the most prevalent. It
changes every year and is good for one year.
   This year's strains are A Shanghai, A Taiwan and B Yamagata,
said Gunn. The names are the same as the strains covered by last
year's vaccine, but this year's A Shanghai is a slightly different
subtype, he said.
   The shot typically costs $10 to $15 at a doctor's office, and
takes two to three weeks to produce immunity, said Dr. Jerry Park,
a family practitioner.
   Traditional remedies are usually the only recourse for people
who catch the flu: bed rest, warm fluids and over-the-counter
painkillers - except aspirin in children, which has been associated
with the rare but often fatal Reye's syndrome.
   An antiviral prescription drug called amantadine, marketed also
as Symmetrel, is effective against type A flu if it is treated
early, lessening the disease's severity and duration, Park said.
   When it comes to the common cold, however, about the only things
that help are still the things ``your mother told you,'' Nicolas
said. ``Get a lot of rest, take a lot of fluids, stay out of
drafts. Do all the things that help your body fight the infection.
... Eat the best you can.''

   Alan Cranston's decision to drop out of the
Senate leadership because of poor health opens the door for a
moderate shift and avoids a potentially bloody intramural battle.
   Cranston announced Thursday that he was suffering from prostate
cancer. In addition to leaving the Senate when his term expires in
two years, he said he would not seek another two-year term as the
Democrats' deputy leader in party caucuses next week.
   The 76-year-old, four-term senator was facing his second
straight challenge from Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., for the
leadership post.
   Ford ran against him two years ago and lost, but Cranston's
political stock has collapsed since then.
   Cranston is under investigation for his ties to former savings
and loan executive Charles Keating, whose financial empire
collapsed at an estimated cost of $2 billion to the taxpayers.
   Ford has a voting record more moderate than Cranston's liberal
pattern, and he is a far less controversial figure.
   ``Alan has been a respected colleague for the past 16 years and
my thoughts and prayers are with him for a complete and speedy
recovery,'' Ford said in a statement Thursday.
   Few other changes are expected in the Senate organizational
meetings before the 102nd Congress convenes in January. With the
Senate remaining under Democratic control, George Mitchell,
D-Maine, is unchallenged for majority leader and Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
likewise for minority leader.
   Cranston has been the deputy Democratic leader since 1977,
including the last two years under Mitchell.
   Mitchell called Cranston's announcement ``a sad one for all his
colleagues, but especially for me. His help and support in my first
Congress as majority leader meant more to me than I can easily
express.''
   In the House, which holds its organizational meetings next
month, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and his leadership team
are expected to return on the Democratic side. Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Calif., is replacing Rep. Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., as Democratic
campaign chairman.
   There is unrest among House Republicans, however.
   After another losing electoral season, Rep. Don Sundquist,
R-Tenn., is challenging the party's long-time campaign chairman Guy
Vander Jagt for his job.
   Sundquist denied in a letter to colleagues that his campaign is
a slap at House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who has been
closely overseeing Vander Jagt's operation.
   Gingrich himself barely survived in Tuesday's election, winning
by less than 1 percent of the vote, and there is talk that Rep.
Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., might mount a challenge for the whip's job.
   Lewis, chairman of the House Republican Conference, was upset
that Gingrich was pushing Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., to run
against him, sources said.

   A twin-engine airplane attempting to
land in heavy rain at an east Texas airport crashed Thursday night
in thick woods, killing all five people aboard, police said.
   The Piper Aerostar crashed shortly after 6 p.m. near Lake
Nacogdoches, about eight miles west of the city.
   The victims were identified as Jim Grisham, the pilot, Tim Owens
and Joe Siedschlag, all of Hot Springs, Ark., Mary Angel, 36, and
her 8-year-old son Thomas, both of Peachtree City, Ga.
   The ages of the three men were not immediately available, said
Pat Denman of the Texas Department of Public Safety in Lufkin. It
was not immediately known who owned the plane, which crashed at
A.L. Mangum Airport.
   The plane was about six miles east of the airport when it
crashed.
   Nacogdoches is 151 miles southeast of Dallas.

<TEXT>
   Nancy and Christopher Romei are
wedded to each other, and to the U.S. Navy. Like most military
couples, their country comes first when duty calls.
   Both are part of Operation Desert Shield, although they are
1,000 miles apart and haven't seen each other in more than three
months. Romei didn't find out for sure his wife had been mobilized
until he had been at sea for a month.
   ``This is our chosen profession. Being apart is just a fact of
life. We just accept it and live with it,'' said Romei, 33, a chief
petty officer aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Biddle on duty
in the Red Sea.
   His wife is a corpsman and X-ray technician at the Navy's Fleet
Hospital No. 5, located on the eastern side of the Arabian
peninsula.
   ``It's part of the contract,'' said Mrs. Romei, 38. ``He always
told me he was married to the Navy first. Besides, this
(separation) won't last forever. It's just a little piece of
life.''
   The Biddle was scheduled to leave Norfolk, Va., Aug. 7 as part
of its regular tour of the Mediterranean Sea. It was diverted to
the Red Sea to enforce U.N. sanctions against Iraq for its takeover
of Kuwait, and Romei, a native of Leeds, Ala., went with it.
   His wife, originally from Valparaiso, Ind., was stationed at a
Navy hospital in Virginia Beach, Va. She got a call in the middle
of the night saying she was being deployed in Saudi Arabia. All she
could do was send her husband a letter.
   When duty called, she was ready.
   ``The Navy trained me to do this job. It's time to produce for
the Navy,'' Mrs. Romei said during a break from her duties.
   The military has separated them before. They saw each other only
nine days during a recent 18-month period.
   But this time, they're both away from home. Mrs. Romei persuaded
a friend to take power of attorney and pay the mortgage, take care
of the monthly bills and tend to their two cars. They have no
children or pets, but most of their houseplants became casualties
of war.
   ``It was like pulling my hair out trying to find someone to do
these things,'' Mrs. Romei said.
   Unless things change dramatically, the couple will be apart for
their 10th wedding anniversary on Jan. 22. And she won't be with
him to celebrate his birthday on Jan. 7.
   But Romei is more concerned about his wife's safety than about
sentimental occasions.
   ``I'm not comfortable with her being there,'' Romei said. ``I
feel a lot safer because I'm on a warship. I'm designed to fight.
   ``Where she is, a leaker on a plane or a Scud missile could get
through. If they (the Iraqis) thrust hard south, they could break
through. I don't have any doubts about who will win ultimately, but
...''
   The biggest worriers are their parents, however.
   ``They ask why. Why are we here? Is it for oil? Or is it for
principle? And if it's for principle, why haven't we done
anything?'' Romei said.
   Meanwhile, the couple had a common message for each other and
their parents: ``I love you.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama wants to try ousted dictator
Gen. Manuel Noriega if the United States drops its case against
him, President Guillermo Endara says.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' Endara told
reporters Thursday.
   Noriega's lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said Thursday he
plans to move for dismissal of the U.S. drug trafficking case
against the former Panamanian strongman. Noriega has been in jail
in Miami since shortly after a December U.S. invasion of Panama
ousted him from power.
   Rubino's statement was in response to CNN broadcasts of parts of
taped conversations between Noriega and his lawyers that the
defense said prejudice Noriega's case.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias said Noriega has ``very serious
charges against him'' in Panama.
   The Panamanian government has charged Noriega and at least seven
of his officers with looting the treasury.
   ``If for any reason he goes free in the United States, he would
have to be extradited to Panama to face justice, which the
Panamanian people demand,'' said Arias, who along with Endara spoke
to reporters after a business-related news conference.
   Foreign Minister Julio Linares, also at the news conference,
said Panama is considering whether it should request Noriega's
extradition.
   The Foreign Ministry said it is cooperating with the United
States in talks which began last week for the development of a
joint law enforcement agreement that would help control drug
trafficking and money laundering.
   Panama established new rules for preventing illicit drug money
transactions in March, the ministry noted.
   ``With the dictatorship overthrown, the legal steps mentioned
have become powerful, effective instruments of legal and
administrative action to combat drug trafficking and money
laundering, the ministry said in a news release.

   The Ingersoll Foundation has awarded the prizes since 1983 to
recognize authors whose works affirm the moral principles of
Western civilization, the sponsor said.
   McDonald, 63, of Coker, Ala., a historian at the University of
Alabama, won the Richard M. Weaver Award for Scholarly Letters.
   He has written several books on early American history,
including studies of the presidencies of George Washington and
Thomas Jefferson and a biography of Alexander Hamilton.
   Causley, 73, of Launceston, England, won the T.S. Eliot Award
for Creative Writing. He has written several collections of poetry
and a number of books for young readers. He also is the editor of
several poetry anthologies.
   Each author received $20,000 at a dinner Thursday night.
   Previous winners of the letters award include Edward O. Wilson,
Andrew Lytle and Robert Nisbet. Novelists V.S. Naipaul, Eugene
Ionesco and Jorge Luis Borges are among previous winners of the

<HEAD>D.C. Mayor-Elect Calls for Restrictions on Barry's Powers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor-elect Sharon Pratt Dixon wants the
District of Columbia City Council to restrict Mayor Marion Barry's
authority to spend money and make personnel changes until he leaves
office in January.
   Dixon also called Thursday for a 20 percent increase in the
money the federal government pays the city yearly to offset the
loss in property tax revenue caused by the presence of so many
tax-exempt federal offices.
   At a news conference, Dixon urged the council to override
Barry's veto of a measure that would prohibit him from signing
contracts worth more than $1 million for services or office space.
   She also asked for legislation prohibiting government raises,
promotions or the conversion of temporary appointments to career
service. Both emergency measures, which would expire after 30 days,
will be considered by the council next week.
   Barry, who is appealing a six-month prison sentence for cocaine
possession, has denied approving anything but routine contracts or
making any unusual personnel moves. But Dixon said, ``I wouldn't
have urged emergency legislation if I didn't think it was at least
a potential problem.''
   Dixon, Council Chairman-elect John A. Wilson and Eleanor Holmes
Norton, who will become the district's non-voting delegate to
Congress, said they had agreed to lobby Congress to raise the
federal payment from $430 million to $516 million.
   They said the $86 million increase roughly equals the amount the
district would have received if the federal payment had risen with
inflation instead of remaining flat for the last five years.
   City officials have said an increased payment is essential to
dealing with the district government's mounting deficit, which
could reach $200 million next year.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is warning
consumers against taking an illegally marketed and possibly
dangerous drug used for strength training and body building.
   The FDA said Thursday that it had received reports of more than
30 people in California, Florida and Georgia becoming ill after
taking GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyric acid.
   The drug is also called sodium oxybate and gamma hydroxybutyrate
sodium.
   The FDA said GHB can cause nausea and vomiting, severe
respiratory problems, seizures and coma.
   GHB is sold as powder or granules through mail order outlets,
health food stores, gyms and fitness centers. It is promoted for
strength training, body building, weight loss and as a replacement
for L-tryptophan.
   L-tryptophan, a food supplement used as a sleep aid and for
depression and weight control, was ordered off the market last
March when it was linked to an outbreak of a rare blood disorder
called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
   GHB is being evaluated in approved clinical trials as a
treatment for narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.

<HEAD>FCC Rules Would Require Universal Phone Access for
Hearing-Impaired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rules proposed by the Federal Communications
Commission would require all telephone companies to provide service
to hearing- and speech-impaired callers by mid-1993.
   The commission's 5-0 vote Thursday set into motion rules to
fulfill the communications provisions of the Americans With
Disabilities Act of 1990.
   The act, which President Bush signed in July, requires that the
nation's 26 million hearing- and speech-impaired individuals have
access to phone company relay services that allow them to
communicate with hearing callers.
   Impaired callers typically punch a keyboard connected with a
telephone operator, who then relays the message either
electronically to another impaired person or verbally to a hearing
caller.
   The provisions cover intrastate and interstate calls and states
will be allowed to establish prices for intrastate services, with
FCC oversight.
   The FCC must establish rules within a year, and phone companies
must meet those provisions by July 26, 1993.
   The proposal requires, among other things, 24-hour service,
seven days a week, with rates ``commensurate with those of
functionally equivalent voice communications services.''
   Relay operators may not refuse calls, limit their length or
reveal or alter their contents.

<HEAD>Task Force To Study Improvements In Boston-New York Rail Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Transportation Department task force will
study how to shorten rail passenger travel time between Boston and
New York, Secretary Samuel K. Skinner says.
   Skinner announced Thursday that the federal task force will
assign priorities to projects to improve service between the two
cities.
   Scheduled for completion by next summer, the task force will
also develop ``logical cost allocations'' for improvements among
interested state governments, local transportation authorities and
private parties, he said.
   ``Now that the Washington-New York portion of the northeast
corridor has been improved, we need to turn our attention to the
New York-Boston segment,'' Skinner told a meeting of the Railway
Progress Institute.
   ``Facilities and services need to be upgraded to improve the
travel time on the New York-Boston run and to enhance the commuter
services that share the right of way with Amtrak,'' Skinner said.
   ``Speedy and reliable rail service would encourage more
passengers to use the trains and this could help to relieve some of
the congestion in the major airports in the Northeast,'' he said.
   The departmental study, expected to cost $1 million, will be
headed by Gil Carmichael, administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, and Brian W. Clymer, administrator of the Urban
Mass Transit Administration.

   Cable TV mogul Ted Turner has bought a large
opal and diamond ring for actress Jane Fonda, and they apparently
will be getting engaged, a Fonda spokeswoman said.
   The ring, which Turner bought Tuesday at Tiffany's in Los
Angeles, will be presented to Fonda on her Dec. 21 birthday, said
Pat Newcomb, a publicist for the Academy Award-winning actress.
   Asked if the ring was an engagement ring, Newcomb told The
Associated Press: ``I guess you could call it that.'' She described
the ring as having an opal between a pair of diamonds.
   The celebrity couple has no immediate plans to set a wedding
date, Newcomb said.
   Fonda, 52, and Turner, 51, traveled recently to the Soviet Union
for the premiere of ``Gone With the Wind,'' the crown jewel of
Turner's MGM movie archives.
   If the engagement does culminate in marriage, it would be the
third for Fonda, who was married to French director Roger Vadim and
California Assemblyman Tom Hayden, the former 1960s student
radical. She has two children. It also would be the third marriage
for Turner, who was previously wed to Judy Nye and Jane Shirley
Smith. He has five children.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Harry Reasoner, the folksy ``60 Minutes''
correspondent who helped start the top-rated CBS News program in
1968, is cutting back on his workload next season.
   ``It's been a nice ride, but you can't go on forever,'' Reasoner
said Thursday.
   He decided to scale back from full-time reporter status to
become the show's ``editor emeritus'' and a ``contributing
correspondent.'' That means he'll do perhaps six reports a year
instead of 20.
   ``I suddenly realized I'd been working 53 years, about half of
it on `60 Minutes,' and I thought I'd like to take it a little
easier,'' he said.
   Reasoner, 67, began his journalism career as a Minneapolis
newspaperman and has won several Emmy awards and a Peabody award
for his broadcast work.
   He joined CBS in 1956, left in 1970 to work at ABC and returned
to CBS and ``60 Minutes'' in 1978.
   He and Mike Wallace, now 72, were the original on-air
correspondents for ``60 Minutes.''

   ``Sorry we screwed up your lunch hour,'' he joked.
   The TV bar mirrors the layout and decor of the the Bull &amp; Finch

   A man convicted of sexually assaulting a
woman who testified against him with six of her 46 personalities
maintains she wasn't mentally ill and that she consented to have
sex with him.
   Mark A. Peterson, whom a jury Thursday found guilty of
second-degree sexual assault, denied he knew the 27-year-old woman
had a multiple-personality disorder and said he will appeal.
   ``I have been the victim for just having a fling with a girl,''
Peterson said. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine
during sentencing scheduled for Dec. 10. He remained free on
$10,000 bond.
   ``I still don't think she is mentally ill,'' Peterson said after
the verdict. ``What's there to be sorry about? Why should I be
sorry for her?''
   The woman was diagnosed in February as having the disorder. The
diagnosis has only been recognized in the past decade.
   She blinked her eyes and bowed her head as she summoned six
different personalities to the witness stand Wednesday. Four of
them were sworn in individually.
   The woman testified that one personality, a 20-year-old woman,
had sex with Peterson, 29, in a municipal park June 11 after a
coffee date.
   Under Wisconsin law, it is a crime to have sex with people known
to suffer from a mental illness that makes them incapable of
understanding their conduct.
   Peterson testified: ``She excited me. ... She was pretty. ... I
asked her if I could love her. She said, `Yes.'''
   District Attorney Joseph Paulus told the Circuit Court jury of
six men and six women that Peterson, who is married and unemployed,
exploited the 20-year-old.
   Peterson treated the victim ``like a piece of meat at his
disposal to play games with,'' Paulus said. ``(The woman) is his
little secret. She is the person he can call on to have sex. She is
the mental illness he can manipulate.''
   The woman testified that Peterson manipulated the personality
that was prevalent at the time to force her to have intercourse.
She said the 20-year-old didn't know what sex was. Her real
persona, she said, was unaware of the affair until learning about
it from another personality, a 6-year-old girl.
   The jury, which deliberated about six hours, was asked to decide
three issues: whether the woman was mentally ill, whether the
illness made her incapable of appraising her conduct and whether
Peterson knew of the illness.
   Jury foreman David Ward said, ``A statement Peterson gave police
that said he was aware of the woman's different personalities was a
key to the conviction.'' Peterson said he signed the statement on
June 14 only because he was tired of questioning.
   Defense and prosecution psychiatrists differed over the
legitimacy of the disorder diagnoses and whether the woman, who
earned an associate degree from college, was aware of her conduct.
   The woman ackowledged that, as a teen-ager, she saw the motion
picture ``The Three Faces of Eve'' concerning a woman with multiple
personalities.
   Psychiatrists said about 7,000 Americans have multiple
personality disorder, many of them having assumed protective
mentalities to escape child abuse. She said her adoptive parents
abused her as a child.
   Peterson denied knowing of any mental problem until, following
the affair in his car, she switched to a new personality after he
drove her home.
   ``I was very surprised,'' he said. ``I never seen that before.''
   He said he telephoned the next day to apologize and she told
him: ``I'm going to prosecute you, you bastard.''
   Defense lawyer Ed Salzsieder argued Peterson was guilty of
nothing more than bad judgment and promiscuity. Peterson's ``no
rocket scientist,'' he said.

   Chandra Shekhar will preside over the smallest minority
government India has ever had.
   His dissident faction had only 56 votes in the policy-making
lower house of Parliament when the vote of confidence was taken,
although aides claimed Thursday it now controls 280 of the body's
522 votes.
   Chandra Shekhar's aspirations were reinforced by an announcement
by former Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandi that he had declined an offer
to head a government and his Congress Party would back him, but
without joining a coalition.
   No single party in Parliament has a majority. By agreeing to
support Chandra Shekhar from outside, Gandhi and his Congress Party
could make or break the new government but would not hold any posts
in the Cabinet.
   Gandhi could use the opportunity to prepare his own party for
new elections. His party has 195 seats, and its small-party allies
have 15.
   Singh's government was shaken by separatist struggles in Kashmir
and Punjab states, rising prices and the ousted prime minister's
program to increase the number of government jobs reserved for
low-caste Hindus. The policy led to violent demonstrations and a
wave of suicides among upper-caste Hindus.
   The government was dealt a final blow last month when the

<HEAD>Chandra Shekhar Named New Prime Minister, To Form New Government</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Chandra Shekhar was named
India's new prime minister Friday, after he helped topple the
government of V.P. Singh this week amid religious violence,
separatist struggles and a disputed job policy.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, who picked the new prime
minister, ``was satisfied I am able to form the government,''
Chandra Shekhar told reporters.
   Chandra Shekhar will be sworn in on Saturday and will face
Parliament on or before Nov. 20 to prove his majority in
Parliament.
   The new 63-year-old prime minister appeared composed while
speaking outside the presidential palace following a 35-minute
meeting with the president.
   Asked what his immediate programs would be, he said:
``Priorities I shall discuss after tomorrow's swearing-in.''
   His first challenge will be to stem a wave of violence between
India's Hindu majority and Moslem minority.
   At least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in riots
sparked by a Hindu fundamentalist attempt to replace a mosque with
a temple in the Hindu holy town of Ayodhya.
   Prime Minister Singh, in power for 11 months, lost a vote of
confidence in Parliament on Wednesday. It was the first time an
Indian government was ousted by Parliament since the country won
independence from Britain in 1947.
   Chandra Shekhar would preside over the smallest minority
government India has ever had.
   His newly named Janata Dal (Socialist) Party had only 56 votes
in the policy-making lower house of Parliament when the vote of
confidence was taken. Aides claimed Thursday that the group now
controls 280 of the body's 522 votes.
   Chandra Shekhar's aspirations were reinforced by an announcement
by former Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandi that he had declined an offer
to head a government and his Congress Party would back him, but
without joining a coalition.
   No single party in Parliament has a majority. By agreeing to
support Chandra Shekhar from outside, Gandhi and his Congress Party
could make or break the new government but would not hold any posts
in the Cabinet.
   Gandhi could use the opportunity to prepare his own party for
new elections. His party has 195 seats, and its small-party allies
have 15.
   Singh's government was shaken by separatist struggles in Kashmir
and Punjab states, rising prices and the ousted prime minister's
program to increase the number of government jobs reserved for
low-caste Hindus. The policy led to violent demonstrations and a
wave of suicides among upper-caste Hindus.
   The government was dealt a final blow last month when the
Bharatiya Janata Party withdrew support from the coalition in
protest over Singh's handling of bloody clashes over a shrine
claimed by both Hindus and Moslems.

<HEAD>California Senator's Retirement Plans Spotlight Scramble for
Successor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Alan Cranston's decision not to
seek re-election in 1992 because of prostate cancer has focused
attention on an already crowded field of would-be successors.
   But some of them may instead challenge the person Gov.-elect
Pete Wilson picks as his successor for California's other U.S.
Senate seat.
   Attracted by Cranston's political weakness stemming from his
involvement in the savings and loan scandal, at least 10 Democrats,
including former Gov. Jerry Brown, former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein and Walt Disney Corp. President Frank Wells, had
floated trial balloons about challenging Cranston or running if he
stepped down.
   Likely Republican candidates include former Rep. Ed Zschau, a
moderate who narrowly lost to Cranston four years ago. Zschau might
be challenged in the Republican primary by a conservative such as
former U.S. Treasurer Bay Buchanan, sister of Washington
commentator Pat Buchanan, or television commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, a former White House aide to Richard Nixon.
   But the political outlook is complicated by the fact that
California's other Senate seat will change hands early next year.
Wilson, a Republican, was elected governor Tuesday and will appoint
a senatorial successor in January to serve until a special election
is held in 1992 on the same ballot with the race to fill Cranston's
seat. Some potential candidates for Cranston's seat probably will
switch to the race against Wilson's successor.
   None of the possible contenders to replace Cranston made formal
announcements after Cranston issued his written statement Thursday.
Most declined to comment entirely.
   Rep. Barbara Boxer of San Francisco, who has been the most
outspoken Democrat about her intentions to run against the
76-year-old Cranston, said only that ``my concern is for Alan's
health. My hopes and prayers are for a full recovery.''
   A spokesman for Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Sacramento, said Matsui
intends to enter the race but ``there will not be a formal
announcement for some time.'' Rep. Mel Levine of Los Angeles said
through spokesman Elmy Bermejo that he also ``is interested in
looking at the race.''
   A spokeswoman for Feinstein, who narrowly lost the race for
governor to Wilson, left the door open for a senatorial run. ``She
has said her intention is to remain in public life. How that
happens is unclear. She will look at the race,'' Feinstein
spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said.
   Brown, currently the state Democratic Party chairman, declined
requests for comment. He had hinted that he would run for the seat
if Cranston stepped down.
   Cranston also said he would not seek re-election by his
Democratic colleagues next Tuesday to the post of assistant
majority leader, which he has held since 1977. His chief rival for
that job, Sen. Wendell Ford of Kentucky, also limited his remarks
to concern about Cranston's health.
   Cranston's written announcement made no reference to the Senate
Ethics Committee investigation of his relationship with Charles
Keating, the indicted former president of Lincoln Savings and Loan
who contributed $850,000 to a voter registration drive and other
political groups associated with Cranston.
   Cranston's popularity has plunged since he was named as one of
five senators who allegedly intervened with federal regulators on
behalf of Keating's savings and loan empire. The thrift later
collapsed at a cost of $2 billion to the federal government in
addition to wiping out the uninsured savings of at least 22,000
mostly elderly Californians.
   In a survey last summer, pollster Mervin Field listed 10
potential Democratic contenders for Cranston's seat, and found that
Cranston finished third, behind Brown and Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy,
who tied for first.
   Other prospective Democrat candidates, in descending order of
support in Field's survey: Boxer, state Controller Gray Davis, San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, Matsui and Rep. Tom Lantos of
Burlingame, the Disney Corp.'s Wells and Levine.
   Another independent pollster, Steve Teichner, said Cranston's
announcement would have no impact ``because I don't think there was
anyone who thought he was going to run again anyway.''
   Teichner said he didn't expect to get a clear picture of who
might run in either party for Cranston's seat until Wilson names
his successor.
   Wilson, meanwhile, refused to give any hint of either his pick
or when he would announce t.
   Cranston's statement said his physicians told him his cancer
``is apparently totally curable, but immediate treatment is
necessary.'' He added that he wanted to complete his final two
years in the Senate ``free of the burdens and the perils of
campaigning and fund-raising.''
   He was elected to his first of four Senate terms in 1968 after
two terms as state controller. In 1984 he waged a brief,
unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination for president.

<HEAD>Social `Mavericks' Really Are Influenced By Others, Study Suggests</HEAD>

   Most people who seem to do and say whatever they
want while ignoring others actually care about their ``social
maverick'' image and will change their stated beliefs to protect
it, a new study says.
   Researchers caught some of them in the act of doing that when
they were judged too conformist, showing such people pay more
attention to others than they let on.
   The study shows ``the appearance of being indifferent to others
is an affectation to some degree,'' said Roy F. Baumeister, a
psychology professor at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland.
   ``But you also want to keep in mind that being recognized as
something is a big part of being that way. Any trait has to be
socially validated, so it's important to them that their autonomy
be recognized.''
   University of Florida psychologists Barry Schlenker and Michael
Weigold decided to test independence, using 94 UF students who had
scored high or low on a test that measures, in part,
independent-mindedness.
   Schlenker and Weigold reported their results in the October
issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
   Changing stated beliefs may be unconscious and certainly not
devious, Schlenker said.
   ``Self-presentation is part and parcel of everyday life. ...
There's nothing evil about it,'' he said.
   Other psychologists disagree, he said. They say that while some
people tailor their words and deeds to make an impression, others
are more autonomous, acting on their inner beliefs and tuning out
the opinions of others.
   In the study, the students first completed an opinion
questionnaire that ranked how strongly they agreed or disagreed
with particular statements about topics like religion and
affirmative action. They also completed a questionnaire about
personal interests.
   In a later session, they were randomly split into two groups and
told they were about to meet another student. One group was told
that this person considered them conformist because of their
answers on the personal interest questionnaire. The other students
were told they had been judged independent.
   Then the students were handed another opinion questionnaire,
which duplicated some items of the first one. They were told that
its asterisk markings indicated which responses were given by most
other students.
   In fact, this was bogus. For half the students, chosen randomly,
the markings made it seem that their own opinions largely followed
campus norms. For the others, their opinions were made to look
quite different.
   The students were then asked to fill in this questionaire, and
told that the person they were about to meet would scrutinize it.
   As a result, some students faced this situation:
   You consider yourself independent, but you're about to meet
somebody who thinks you're a conformist. Now you find out he's
right. If you fill out this new questionnaire honestly you'll
affirm that offensive judgment, but you can look autonomous again
if you shade the truth a little.
   As a group, people with that dilemma changed their expressed
opinions away from those they thought were conformist.
   ``If by expressing their real attitudes it made them look
dependent, they misrepresented their attitudes to re-establish an
image of autonomy,'' Schlenker said.

<HEAD>Dollar Continues Surge Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to surge against the Japanese
yen today in Tokyo, while share prices regained most of their
morning losses with the help of bargain hunting.
   The dollar closed at 130.50 yen, up 1 yen from Thursday's
129.50-yen finish. It opened at 130.45 yen and ranged between
130.30 yen and 131.00 yen.
   Amid worries over the increasing tensions in the Middle East,
Japanese investors bought the dollar up to the 131-yen level in an
attempt to increase their dollar positions for fear that war may
break out in the Persian Gulf during a three-day weekend in Tokyo,
dealers said.
   Japanese financial markets will be closed Monday for a national
holiday commemorating Emperor Akihito's enthronement.
   Dealers said reports that President Bush ordered major increases
in the U.S. Persian Gulf forces initially helped boost the U.S.
currency.
   Many investors consider the dollar a safe haven at a time of
international crisis such as the Mideast dispute.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said
today that the dollar is not falling precipitously on foreign
exchange markets.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost
38.01 points, or 0.17 percent, to end the week's trading at
22,931.80. The index, which lost 530.44 points Thursday, was 346.23
points lower at the end of the morning session. It regained most of
that in the afternoon.
   Traders said the index quickly recovered toward the close,
sparked by arbitrage buying to take profits from future-spot price
gaps by large brokerages, in addition to adjustments for their
short, or oversold, positions following the index's morning plunge.
   ``But very few people were buying because of their fears about
the intensifying tensions in the Middle East,'' said Kazuyuki
Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co.
   He said investors avoided buying also because of the long
weekend in Japan.
   The declining yen and the government bond prices due to the
fears about the Gulf prompted them to step off to the sidelines.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 84.16 points, down from
Thursday's 84.26-point finish. Their yield was higher at 8.900
percent from 7.890.

   Flu vaccination is strongly recommended for the
following groups of people, according to the federal Centers of
Disease Control in Atlanta:
   - All people over age 65.
   - Anyone between the ages of 6 months and 65 years with chronic
heart or lung problems; nursing home residents; and people under
regular medical care during the past year for diabetes, kidney
conditions, compromised immunity (including infection with the
virus that causes AIDS) or inherited blood disorders such as sickle
cell anemia and thalassemia.
   - Children under 18 receiving long-term aspirin therapy for
conditions such as arthritis. This recommendation is based on the
rare but known link in children between aspirin, influenza and the
development of Reye's syndrome, which can be fatal or cause
permanent brain damage.
   - Physicians, nurses and other health-care workers who deal with
people in the above high-risk groups, employees in nursing homes
and chronic health-care facilities, providers of home care and
household members of high-risk people.
   - Anyone who wants to reduce the chances of getting the flu.
   ---
   Who should avoid the vaccination, according to the CDC:
   - Anyone allergic to eggs. The vaccine is grown in chicken eggs,
and even though highly purified, could cause an adverse reaction.
   - Anyone with a fever, until the fever subsides.

<HEAD>Kohl's Surprise Border Gesture A Boost for Mazowiecki Government

<TEXT>
   Polish officials are elated by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's unexpected decision to sign within three
weeks a treaty confirming his country's long-disputed border with
Poland.
   The decision to move up the signing is also a political boost
for Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   ``One of the most thorny problems disappears from the
Polish-German front,'' the pro-Mazowiecki daily Gazeta Wyborcza
said today of the development.
   Kohl and Mazowiecki met Thursday along the Oder River and
decided that the 45-year dispute over the Polish-German border
would finally be laid to rest with a treaty-signing ceremony in
Warsaw before the end of the month.
   The line on the Oder and Neisse rivers, drawn by the victorious
Allies after World War II, gave Poland 40,000 square miles of
former German territory in Silesia, Pomerania and East Prussia. The
acquired territory is one-third of today's Poland.
   The border was originally meant to be provisional, pending a
post-war peace treaty that never took place. It created tension
between Poland and Germany for decades, and right-wing German
politicians called for restoring some or all of the land to
Germany.
   Although Germany already had promised to accept the border as
part of the process that led to German unification Oct. 3, the
treaty was not expected to be signed until next year.
   The Kohl government had sought to link it to a larger friendship
pact that would include guarantees of human rights for up to 1
million ethnic Germans who remain in Poland.
   A German official traveling with Kohl privately described the
decision to speed up the border treaty as a gift to Mazowiecki, who
is locked in an uphill campaign for president against Solidarity
Chairman Lech Walesa.
   The treaty is to be signed by Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski and German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. It
was possible it could be signed even before Polish elections on
Nov. 25.
   Briefing reporters after the summit in the Polish border town of
Slubice, Mazowiecki expressed deep satisfaction with the
``important results'' and the ``good will'' showed by Kohl.
   Beside the early signing of the border treaty, he pointed to
progress on a range of Polish-German issues, including the Kohl
government's intention to abolish by Christmas mandatory visas for
Poles traveling to Germany.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said the Germans
accepted Poland's view on the delicate issue of its ethnic German
minority - that ethnic Germans will have rights on a par with other
ethnic groups in Poland and generally accepted European standards.
   There had been calls in Germany for extending them special
status or even dual Polish and German citizenship.
   The two leaders also agreed to upgrade the 372-mile road linking
Warsaw and Berlin, much of which is only two lanes, to remove trade
barriers and to establish additional border crossings.

<HEAD>Critics Say Enthronement Violates Constitution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Late one spring night, Toru Yuge stood up and
reached for a book from a shelf above the window in his
second-floor study.
   Immediately after he sat down at a low table beneath the window,
two bullets shot throught the pane, sending shards of glass across
the room.
   The gunshots were also sending a message to Yuge.
   ``I thought that we would be harassed by ultra-rightists, but I
didn't expect that kind of attack so suddenly,'' said the
soft-spoken Yuge, president of Tokyo's Ferris University.
   A few days before the shooting, he and the presidents of three
other Japanese Christian colleges had issued a statement
criticizing government plans to sponsor enthronement ceremonies for
Emperor Akihito.
   They and other opponents charge that the rites violate the
constitution's separation of religion and state, and say the
government is using virtually the same Shinto ceremonies that made
Akihito's father and grandfather ``living gods.''
   ``In planning the ceremonies, the government has basically
returned to the pre-war laws that were deleted from the postwar
constitution,'' Yuge says. ``They are reinstating the idea that the
emperor is god and thereby going completely against the current
constitution.''
   Yuge, 66, says he and the other presidents continue to receive
harassing phone calls and remain under police protection. He now
closes the shutters before working at home and informs the police
each morning of his plans for the day.
   Twenty-five other university presidents have since joined in
supporting their statement, although others declined out of fear,
Yuge says.
   ``This is an issue that will have a strong impact on Japan's
future. So it's natural that there are strong feelings on both
sides,'' he says. ``But because of its importance, we need to be
able to discuss it openly, without the threat of violence on either
side.''
   Many Japanese between the political extremes see the coronation
rites that begin Monday as quaint, mysterious observances far
removed from their lives. In a poll released Wednesday by the
Nippon Television Network, nearly half the respondents said they
had no interest.
   But others say the ceremonies have profound implications for
Japan's political future.
   Japan's Constitution, written under U.S. guidance during the
Allied occupation after World War II, changed the emperor's status
from living god to ``symbol of the state.''
   But critics say the rites are an attempt to once again redefine
and strengthen the emperor's role by linking it with Shinto
religion and myth.
   ``The Cabinet, including the prime minister and Imperial
Household Agency, is doing something unforgivable,'' says Yuge.
``The government and the business circles behind it want to
strengthen the emperor to extend their own authority. So it's a
very important turning point.''
   Yoshiyasu Kawane, a Japanese history professor at Osaka City
University, says the government has planned the rites to be as
similar as possible to the enthronements of the past two emperors.
   It was during that period that the government reformed
Shintoism, Japan's highly decentralized indigenous religion, into a
centralized state religion used to glorify the emperor and rally
support for the government, especially during World War II.
   ``The government is trying to create a unifying, nationalistic
force using the same process as in the past,'' Kawane says. ``For
example, the Parliament is debating a law that would allow the
dispatch of Japanese troops overseas. What purpose would Japanese
soldiers be willing to die for now? Not very many people want to
die for the prime minister.''
   Opponents particularly criticize the planned use during
Akihito's enthronement of a 20-foot-high royal said to be patterned
after one used by the sun goddess - thus conveying divinity.
   In Osaka, more than 1,500 people, including Buddhists,
Catholics, Protestants, lawyers and academics, have filed suit in
an attempt to block the use of government funds for the
enthronement.
   Japan's largest Christian organization, the National Christian
Council of Japan, has gathered 130,000 signatures on a petition
condemning state funding of the Nov. 22-23 Daijosai, or ``Great
Food Offering Ritual.''
   More than 1,000 people will participate in a 100-hour hunger
strike beginning Nov. 19 in another protest.
   In the Daijosai, Akihito is to hold an overnight ``communion''
with the sun goddess, from whom the imperial line is said to have
descended. Rightists believe the emperor is reborn as a living god
following a union between the two.
   The Socialist Party, the largest opposition group, plans to
boycott the rite, and leading lawyers have questioned its
constitutionality.
   While ultra-rightists support a stronger role for the emperor,
ultra-leftists demand the abolition of the imperial system and have
vowed to disrupt the enthronement.
   Police count more than 60 violent leftist attacks this year,
more than twice the number in 1989, including  bombing Nov. 1 that
killed a policeman.
   But Yuge says the harassment will not keep him from speaking
out. This week, he released another statement condemning the use of
violence by both sides to suppress freedom of speech.

<HEAD>Officials Declare Victory in Medfly War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EL MONTE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crop-destroying Mediterranean fruit
fly has been wiped out in California after a $52 million campaign
that lasted 15 months, officials said.
   ``We're here to celebrate that we have eradicated the Medfly in
California,'' Jack Parnell, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, said during a news conference Thursday with state
agriculture chief Henry Voss.
   They officially lifted a quarantine barring movement of fruit
and vegetables from infested areas. Medfly traps will continue to
be placed statewide to detect any new arrivals.
   The arrival of illegal fruit and vegetables, usually carried in
travelers' luggage, virtually ensures future infestations, one
official said in an interview last weekend.
   ``There is some perverse streak in human nature. They seem to
believe it's fun to outsmart authorities and bring in just one
mango or just one pineapple from Hawaii,'' said Gera Curry,
spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture. ``All
it takes is one person.''
   Quarantines had been imposed because of worries that Medflies
could spread from urban Southern California to rural agricultural
areas and wreck the state's $18 billion-a-year farming economy.
   Slightly smaller than a common housefly, the Medfly lays its
eggs in fruit and vegetables. The can afflict hundreds of different
plant varieties.
   Florida declared victory over the Medfly in August, four months
after finding a single fly near Miami International Airport.
   The Medfly has plagued California farmers since the early 1980s.
From 1980 to 1982 state and federal officials spent $100 million to
battle the pest.
   The latest infestation caused a public outcry when the state
repeatedly sent helicopters to spray the pesticide malathion over
dozens of communities in a 500-square-mile area. Citizens filed 300
damage claims and numerous lawsuits.
   ``There is no health hazard related to malathion in the amounts
we use,'' Voss said.
   But he added: ``It's something we hope we won't have to do
again. We hope science can come up with alternatives.''
   Roy Cunningham, chairman of the state Medfly Science Advisory
Panel, said last weekend that if the fly returns, enhanced
detection measures should prevent infestations from reaching the
same scale. In 1980 and 1989, the state waited too long to begin
eradication, he said.

   New York City has taken another step to curb
cigarette smoking. The City Council voted overwhelmingly to ban the
sale of cigarette vending machines in most public places to keep
minors from buying smokes.
   Mayor David Dinkins, a former two-pack-a-day smoker, is expected
to sign the bill into law. The council passed it 33-1 on Thursday.
   The move makes New York the largest city in the country to
restrict cigarette vending machines, Councilman Sal Albanese said.
Salt Lake City and Minneapolis have enacted similar bans.
   The city already prohibits the distribution of free cigarettes
on the street and plans to phase out cigarette advertising on
city-owned billboards, on taxis, at baseball stadiums and in the
subways, said Councilman Joseph Lisa.
   Tobacco industry officials decried the latest ban.
   ``The tobacco industry agrees with the goal of keeping
cigarettes out of the hands of kids, but it is a misguided notion
to think that by banning cigarette vending machines that's what
you're going to accomplish,'' said Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman
for the Washington-based Tobacco Institute.
   She said 30 percent of cigarette machines are located in bars,
where children are not supposed to be anyway.
   A spokesman for cigarette maker Philip Morris Inc., Les Zuke,
called the legislation ``unnecessary'' and ``an overreaction.'' He
said vending machines account for only 3 percent of cigarette
sales.
   The bill allows machines in taverns and bars in hotels and
motels as long as they are within sight of the owner or operator,
who is supposed to stop minors from buying. State law bans the sale
of cigarettes to those under age 18.
   The bill would ban machines from such places as restaurants,
bowling alleys and theaters. Violations could result in fines
ranging from not more than $300 for the first offense to $1,000 for
the third. Any subsequent violations could result in suspension of
cigarette licenses for up to one year.
   Councilman Jerome O'Donovan, the lone dissenter, said he doubted
the law would be enforceable and that youngsters still could get
cigarettes by buying them across-the-counter.
   The Music, Cigarette &amp; Amusement Association, Inc., representing
over 150 small businesses in the vending machine industry, said in
October the proposed ban would result in the loss of jobs for 2,000
unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the city.
   Also on Thursday, Patrick Halpin, the executive of Suffolk
County on New York's Long Island, vetoed legislation meant to
restrict access to cigarette vending machines because it was not
strong enough.

<TEXT>
   Despite spending billions of dollars
on air defenses and anti-tank weapons and plans to double the size
of its army, Saudi Arabia will still be unable to fend off a
full-scale Iraqi attack alone.
   Unless Saddam Hussein's formidable military machine is crippled
in the gulf confrontation, that means a sizeable Western military
presence will almost certainly have to remain in the region for
some time to come.
   The Saudis have spent an estimated $40 billion on advanced
weapons systems over the past decade. But they were unable to take
on Saddam's million-strong military juggernaut when it crushed
Kuwait in August and appeared to threaten the Saudis' own desert
kingdom.
   King Fahd had little option but to appeal for U.S. and allied
help to protect a country which contains Islam's holiest shrines,
despite an outcry by some Moslem hard-liners.
   The crisis has benefited the Saudis inasmuch as the threat to
their oilfields overcame the pro-Israel lobby in the U.S. Congress,
which for years blocked the sale of state-of-the-art weaponry to
Riyadh on the grounds it was technically at war with Israel.
   Now the Americans have pledged to sell the Saudis some $20
billion worth of sophisticated hardware, including F-15 C/D Eagle
fighters, Patriot missiles, 350 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 500 Bradley
Fighting Vehicles.
   But even after delivery of the new arsenal over the next two or
three years, analysts say the Saudis will be unable to take on
Saddam alone, if he's still around.
   ``The Saudi defense plan relied on being able to hold the
attackers off for long enough to get outside assistance,'' said
Nadav Safran, a professor of Middle East studies at Harvard
University.
   ``When Saddam's troops marched into Kuwait, the Saudis realized
that even after two decades of beefing up their defenses, they
still didn't have the capacity to hold him off, even for a few
days,'' said Safran, who is the author of ``Saudi Arabia: The
Ceaseless Quest for Security.''
   King Fahd and his defense minister, Prince Sultan, are planning
to more than double the size of the 65,000-man regular Saudi armed
forces, which is supported by a 56,000-man National Guard.
   It is unclear where the recruits will come from. Saudi Arabia,
which is as large as the United States east of the Mississippi, has
only about 8 million citizens and has long suffered from a shortage
of men of military age. As in most gulf countries, the Saudi
military is a volunteer force, and no plans have been announced for
conscription.
   According to the government-controlled press, 50,000 men have
volunteered for the kingdom's Citizen's Army since Aug. 2. The
volunteers receive one month's military training.
   In the event of war, these hastily trained troops are supposed
to be integrated into regular army units.
   Merging the regular armed forces headed by Prince Sultan with
the National Guard, commanded by Crown Prince Abdullah, has been
ruled out for the time being.
   Fahd reportedly favored such a move a decade ago, when he was
crown prince. But he was overruled by other members of the royal
family - wisely, according to Safran, because of the threat to the
monarchy posed by a large army.
   ``Even if they should merge the army and National Guard, they
couldn't develop a capacity to defend themselves against challenges
like that presented by Iraq,'' Safran said.
   ``So to run the risk of a military coup just for the sake of
developing an army that couldn't even guard against the main danger
anyway doesn't make sense.''
   The Saudi Air Force has 179 combat aircraft to Iraq's 500-plus,
and 550 battle tanks to Saddam's 5,500.
   The new U.S. arms package is a key element in the Saudi plan to
bolster its military. But U.S. Representative Mel Levine contends
that the Saudis still couldn't defend themselves, ``no matter how
gold-plated their equipment is.''
   Levine, an Israel supporter and critic of the proposed arms
sales, argues the administration is using the invasion of Kuwait as
a pretext to overcome the pro-Israel lobby's influence.
   Despite the Saudi military buildup, the kingdom will still have
to rely on balancing regional powers with money and diplomacy
rather than on military might.
   That is how the Saudis have coped with regional threats in the
past, including a rebellion in neighboring Yemen backed by the late
Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1960s, and the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war.

   Minors trying to buy cigarettes have a 2-out-of-3
chance of succeeding, according to an undercover operation that
tested one state's law against selling smokes to people under age
18.
   Federal health oficials reported Thursday that Colorado's 1987
law prohibiting merchants from selling tobacco to minors and
prohibiting youngsters from buying wasn't working too well.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said many vendors may
not be familiar with this law, and ``some may believe enforcement
is unlikely or that the profits from cigarette sales to minors
outweigh possible financial penalties for violating the law.''
   The fine for violations, by merchants or juveniles, is only $25,
said Walter Young, director of the Prevention Programs division of
the Colorado Department of Health.
   The Coalition for a Tobacco-Free Colorado, a consortium of
public and private health organizations, sent 11 young volunteer
teams to 121 sites to see if the children could buy tobacco. At 77
sites, or 64 percent, they were successful.
   ``It's disappointing that merchants have not gotten the message
that they're not supposed to sell to kids,'' Young said.
   All 24 times that minor volunteers went to a cigarette machine,
no one stopped them. The 97 other attempts involved vendors or
sales clerks; 53 of those were successful.
   Colorado's cigarette snoops ranged from age 9 to 17. The survey
was done in August 1989.
   ``Sales clerks did not appear to discriminate in their sales
practices between very young adolescents and those closer to legal
age,'' the CDC said.
   Among those buying from sales clerks, the success rate for
volunteers ages 15-17 was 55 percent, virtually identical to the 54
percent success rate for the other volunteers.
   Options that could cut down on illegal cigarette sales include
banning cigarette machines, but machines account for less than 10
percent of sales to minors, Young noted.
   Since the survey, Colorado health officials have distributed
pamphlets, door stickers and display signs to merchants to
encourage compliance with the law, Young said.
   The CDC said that the minors participating in the project didn't
actually break the law. They approached machines but didn't buy,
and they told any helpful clerks they didn't have enough money for
the purchase.

<HEAD>15 Dead In Black Factional Fighting In Natal Province</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen blacks were stabbed to
death and four were wounded in a vicious factional fight in the
eastern province of Natal, police said today.
   Police said two groups of men clashed Thursday night in
Bruntville, a black township 80 miles northwest of the port city of
Durban.
   Police dispersed the groups and found 15 bodies, all with stab
wounds. Authorities did not identify the combatants.
   In a separate incident, one man was killed and 12 injured when
attackers with assault rifles and a hand grenade fired on a bus
transporting workers Thursday night in Sebokeng, 38 miles south of
Johannesburg.
   The battle in Bruntville erupted after recent confrontations
between rival groups.
   A meeting hall was damaged Wednesday before residents of a
migrant workers hostel were scheduled to gather there.
   During the day Thursday, assailants with guns, knives and
gasoline bombs attacked a workers hostel, leaving one man dead and
dozens injured. Eighteen housing units were destroyed by fire,
police said.
   Women and children then began fleeing Bruntville for the nearby
town of Mooi River, apparently anticipating the large-scale
fighting that broke out later.
   Some 5,000 blacks have died in faction fighting in Natal
Province since 1986. The main combatants have been supporters of
the African National Congress and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom
Party.
   The ANC and Inkatha are the country's two largest black
political movements, and both oppose the apartheid system of racial
segregation. But they differ offer tactics and the vision of a
future South Africa.
   The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks in Natal,
but the ANC on Thursday indefinitely postponed the next round of
discussions.
   The ANC-Inkatha feud in Natal spread to the Johannesburg area in
August, leaving more than 800 dead.

<HEAD>President Names New Prime Minister</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist Chandra Shekhar, facing a
nation bloodied by religious and ethnic strife, was named India's
new prime minister today.
   Chandra Shekhar, the dissident leader who helped topple Prime
Minister V.P. Singh and his government on Wednesday, will be sworn
in Saturday and will seek Parliament's endorsement by Nov. 20,
President Ramaswamy Venkataraman announced.
   The president said he chose Chandra Shekhar because he ``has the
strength to form a viable government'' with the support of the
Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Venkataraman said he offered three other parties the chance to
form a government, but all refused.
   ``It will not be in the national interest to plunge the country
into a general election at this time ... and every effort should be
made to provide the country with a reasonably stable government,''
said the statement.
   Chandra Shekhar, 63, appearing composed as he spoke to reporters
outside the presidential palace after a 35-minute meeting with the
president.
   The president ``was satisfied I am able to form the
government,'' he said, but he declined to discuss his Cabinet or
his agenda.
   Asked what his immediate programs would be, he said:
``Priorities I shall discuss after tomorrow's swearing-in.''
   Later he told reporters he felt nothing special after being
named prime minister-designate. ``I am as normal as always,'' he
said.
   Singh resigned Wednesday after losing a parliamentary vote of
confidence the same day.
   Chandra Shakhar's first challenge will be to stem a wave of
violence between India's Hindu majority and Moslem minority.
   At least 370 people have died in the last three weeks in riots
sparked by a Hindu fundamentalist attempt to replace a mosque with
a temple in the Hindu holy town of Ayodhya.
   About 150 other people have died in protests by upper-caste
Hindus over Singh's affirmative action program to reserve more
government jobs for lower castes. More than half were students and
teen-agers who committed suicide, blaming Singh's policy for their
action.
   The president said he offered Congress, the largest party in
Parliament, first option to form a government. Congress declined,
but said it would give ``unconditional support'' to Chandra
Shekhar, the statement said.
   He then proposed the task to the Hindu right-wing Bharataya
Janata Party, the next largest group, and the Left Front, an
alliance of communist and socialist parties, before turning to
Chandra Shekhar.
   As prime minister, Chandra Shekhar would preside over the
smallest government India has ever had. His dissident faction of
Singh's Janata Dal party had only 56 votes in Parliament when the
government lost a vote of confidence on Wednesday.
   Chandra Shekhar's group, which broke away from the Janata Dal
party earlier in the week, has claimed the support of 280 members
in the 522-seat decision-making lower house of Parliament.
   Gandhi's Congress Party has 195 seats, and its small-party
allies have another 15.
   Critics have argued that the arrangement leaves the new
government vulnerable to Congress, which could withdraw its support
as soon as it feels ready to face elections.
   Singh's Janata Dal formed the government after the November 1989
general elections when it prevented Gandhi's party from winning a
majority.
   The 11-month-old government was reduced to a minority after the
Bharatiya Janata Party, angered by his blocking of the Hindu
campaign over the disputed mosque, withdrew support. Chandra
Shekhar's defection dealt the government its death blow.

   A broadcast union at odds with NBC claims that
NBC News is trying to get rid of some older staffers by putting
them in a common labor pool described as ``professional exile.''
   The network denied it.
   ``These people all have jobs and they're not going away,'' Don
Browne, NBC's executive news director, said of about 35 NBC news
writers and producers, who will be taken from specific programs and
put in the pool for use as needed.
   The move was done as a cost-cutting measure, with the executive
producers of shows like ``Today'' and ``NBC Nightly News'' deciding
which members of their staff would be shifted to the labor pool.
   John Clark, president of the New York local of the National
Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, said Thursday
that 12 of 21 NABET members affected are age 50 or over, and ``we
think these are people the company would like to get rid of.''
   He characterized the pool as ``professional exile'' for those
sent there.
   Browne denied that and other allegations by Clark, including his
claim that NBC is apparently retaliating against NABET members who
sued the network for overtime pay by also putting them in the labor
pool.
   Browne said pool members would be put on duty with programs or
work in NBC News bureaus as requirements dictated. ``These people
are going to be very active,'' he said.
   Clark, whose 900-member local is NABET's largest, said the union
will add a claim of age discrimination to a unfair labor practices
complaint it has filed against NBC with the National Labor
Relations Board.
   No action has been taken yet on the complaint, which was filed
after NBC in August put into effect a new three-year contract that
a majority of the union's 2,300 members at NBC previously had
rejected.
   Three years ago, NABET struck NBC in a bitter walkout that
lasted 17 weeks. No strike vote has been called this time, so far,
although no new negotiations are planned, Clark said.

   Bar patrons couldn't pin him down,
but the long arm of the law finally wrestled Ceasar the bear to the
mat.
   Caesar, a North American black bear that has wrestled patrons of
Midwest bars and nightclubs for the past six years, was held
Thursday in his air conditioned trailer behind the Gazander
Restaurant &amp; Lounge.
   Police in this southwest Chicago suburb warned bar proprieter
Steve Sineni and bear owner Sam Mazzola they would be arrested if
Caesar wrestled again at the lounge. They cited two city ordinances
that carry $500 fines each and a state health law.
   Sineni said he would seek a court order today allowing the bear
back into action.
   Eight patrons paid $10 apiece on Oct. 22 and 29 to get on the
mat with Caesar, hoping to win $1,000 promised to anyone who pinned
the 7-foot, 6-inch, 970 pound bear.
   No one did.
   Animal rights activists also picketed the bar, but assistant
manager Dominic Roti said Caesar was treated well.
   Roti, at 5-foot-11 and 217 pounds, challenged Caesar and lost.
   ``For the first couple of minutes, you make friends with the
bear. Then he knocks you down and puts his paw on top of you,''
Roti said.
   That was enough for Police Chief George Dulzo, who said he had
no intention of taking Caesar into custody.
   ``We won't drag the bear off stage,'' Dulzo said. ``I've seen
the bear. He's bigger than me. Probably smarter, too.''

<HEAD>Judge Bars CNN From Broadcasting Noriega-Lawyer Conversations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge barred the Cable News Network from
broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped conversations with his lawyers,
saying the ousted Panama dictator's right to a fair trial on drug
charges is in jeopardy.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said he would demand that the case
against Noriega be dismissed.
   ``We are absolutely shocked and horrified that the United States
government would wiretap General Noriega and his lawyers engaging
in the most sensitive of communications,'' Rubino said.
   But Justice Department officials said the taping was routine,
and that Noriega had known his calls would be monitored. A federal
prison spokesman said it was up to Noriega to inform officials that
he was talking with his attorneys so they would stop the recording.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Thursday told CNN it
couldn't broadcast the tapes, made by prison officials, and
demanded an investigation into how the network got them. He also
ordered the taping stopped.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, in Tampa on Thursday, said
U.S. officials want to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   CNN accused the judge of exercising unconstitutional prior
restraint and demanded an immediate hearing on the issue from the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. No hearing was
immediately scheduled by the appeals court, but Hoeveler scheduled
another hearing in his court for late this afternoon.
   Meantime, he told the news station not to broadcast, at least
through today, any tapes that would interfere with attorney-client
privilege rights.
   ``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts,'' said CNN President Tom Johnson.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   U.S. Justice Department officials said the taping was routine
and produced a document in English and Spanish that Noriega signed
acknowledging that his phone conversations would be monitored.
   Rubino complained that the taping of Noriega's conversations
violated his client's right to private meetings with his attorneys
and jeopardized his case because the U.S. government now knows his
defense strategy.
   U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Gregory L. Bogdan in Washington
said prisoners are supposed to inform guards when they are talking
to their attorneys so the monitoring can be stopped.
   Federal prosecutors told Hoeveler they haven't heard the tapes.
Rubino was skeptical.
   ``And I believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth
Fairy,'' he said.
   The taping flap is the latest threatening to delay or derail
Noriega's trial on charges he accepted $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   The U.S. government has earmarked $6 million of $20 million in
frozen Noriega assets for payment of his attorneys, but last month
Panama filed a lawsuit accusing Noriega of looting its treasury and
said it would seek to have those assets frozen. Noriega's defense
teams says it needs the money to put together his defense before
the case can go to trial.
   The trial is scheduled to begin early next year, but both sides
agree it will probably be delayed.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara said Thursday that if the
United States does not go through with the trial, Panama wants
Noriega returned to face charges there.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   On second viewing, ``Six Degrees of Separation''
reconfirms its status as the most imaginative play of the year.
   John Guare's scathing, savagely funny tale of New York chic
officially reopened Thursday after moving from a small theater in
Lincoln Center to the much larger Vivian Beaumont.
   The move makes the play eligible for Tony Award nominations next
May. They could give the prize right now. There probably won't be a
better new play all season.
   Guare's play, which originally opened last June, resonates on
many levels - social satire, rapid-fire farce, intellectual
funhouse, tragic pop fable and just plain good story, to name a
few.
   The plot, based on a real-life incident, concerns a young black
man who claims to be the son of actor Sidney Poitier and how he
bamboozles all these rich, supposedly sophisticated New Yorkers.
   Along the way, Guare manages to skewer everything from ``Cats''
to overpriced Italian restaurants to race relations. The author of
``The House of Blue Leaves'' has an ear for the way present-day New
Yorkers talk and think.
   And Jerry Zaks directs in slam-bang style, never allowing the
play to careen out of control.
   The bigger theater hasn't lessened the production's impact. What
has, oddly enough, is the casting of Courtney B. Vance in the
pivotal role of Paul, the young black man who disrupts the lives of
these Upper East Side trendies. Vance is a fine actor but he lacks
the magnetism that James McDaniel brought to the role last summer.
   McDaniel, who left the show to appear in the television series
``Cop Rock,'' had a sinuous charm, a quality that could be
ingratiating and unnerving at the same time. That appeal is missing
from Vance's stiff portrayal of the hustler who makes fools out of
these members of the upper crust.
   The rest of the cast was - and still is - just about perfect.
Stockard Channing manages to make the play's bewildered heroine
both funny and poignant. She wants to believe Paul's tall tale,
celebrating his imagination while forgetting his lie. And John
Cunningham acts and looks picture perfect as the WASP art dealer
not above a little finagling to make some big bucks.
   The large supporting cast is just fine and there are several
standout cameos - Peter Maloney, a mournful parent who doesn't want
to know what his child is doing; Evan Handler as a vindictive rich
kid, and Robert Duncan McNeil as the country bumpkin destroyed by
Paul's deceptions.
   ``Six Degrees of Separation'' is one of those rare plays that
deserves a second look.
   Frank Rich, reviewing the play in Friday's New York Times, said
he found it ``as funny and moving and provocative as ever - still a
fresh experience, not last season's calcified hit.''

   Mayor David Dinkins, struggling to close the
city's massive budget deficit, announced $288 million in job
cutbacks now and warned of many more later.
   The national recession, which is striking the Northeast economy
especially hard, was blamed for the cuts.
   They will include more than 550 layoffs in schools, hospitals
and parks, combined with 5,000 jobs openings that will not be
filled, Dinkins said Thursday.
   Slashing jobs and the $100 million sale of a Manhattan parking
lot to the federal government are supposed to make up a $388
million budget shortfall for the current fiscal year.
   Dinkins said he'll feel the bite too. He plans to cut his staff
by 170 people.
   The budget gap for the next business year, which begins July 1,
1991, is expected to top $1.6 billion. Future efforts to deal with
that shortfall could mean 20,000 lost jobs, Dinkis said.
   Ten thousand of the jobs to be slashed for fiscal year 1992 will
likely result from layoffs, with another 10,000 from attrition,
budget director Philip Michael said. The city has 224,563 workers.
   Under the plan announced Thursday, city schools face hundreds of
teacher layoffs and 1,000 more jobs lost through attrition. Other
cuts include delaying recycling programs and closing some fire
companies. No job cuts were planned for the police force.
   The cuts were forced by a drastic drop in tax revenues. ``The
root of all these problems is the economy,'' Michael said.

   The new Miss World is 21-year-old Gina Marie
Tolleson of Spartenburg, S.C.
   The brown-haired, brown-eyed Ms. Tolleson, who is six feet tall,
was crowned at the 40th annual Miss World beauty contest Thursday
night by last year's winner, Aneta Kreglicka of Poland.
   First runner-up was Miss Ireland, 20-year-old air stewardess
Siobhan McClafferty. Miss Venezuela, 19-year-old dance teacher
Sharon Raquel Luenso Gonzales, was third. A panel of judges made
the selection.
   The contest at the London Palladium was watched live by a
worldwide television audience of 500 million, the organizers said.
   In Britain, however, the 90-minute show, which included
performances from singer Jason Donovan and pianist Richard
Clayderman, was screened later.
   In recent years British television companies have declined to
show the contest live, citing a decline in the number of viewers it
attracts.
   Ms. Tolleson won $19,000 in cash and a work contract worth
$59,000.
   Ms. Tolleson, who said she hopes to become a broadcaster after
finishing her studies, is trained in ballet, jazz and tap dancing.
Her hobbies include horseback riding and gardening.
   This year marked the Miss World contest's return to London. It
was held in Hong Kong for the first time last year after 38 years
in the British capital.

   Police believe leftist radicals opposed to Emperor
Akihito's coronation set a fire today that razed a building on the
grounds of one of Japan's most important Buddhist temples.
   The Hachibuindo hall of Enryakuji temple was found ablaze just
after midnight by a temple guard, said a police official in Otsu,
230 miles west of Tokyo.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said wires
and eight charred batteries were found at the site of the fire, a
common indication of arson. No one was injured.
   ``We believe the fire may have been set by an ultra-leftist
group and are conducting an investigation with that in mind,'' he
said.
   Radical groups opposed to Emperor Akihito's coronation on Monday
have claimed responsibility for setting fires at several Shinto
shrines over the past month and are suspected of arson attacks on
three this week alone.
   The Kakurokyo, or Revolutionary Workers Association, on
Wednesday also claimed responsibility for blasts at a police
dormitory that killed one officer and injured six other people on
Nov. 1.
   Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion, is deeply tied to the
monarchy, and Enryakuji is the head temple of the Tendai sect of
Buddhism, which has been closely associated with Japan's nobility
throughout its history.
   Enryakuji priests began a special prayer service to mark
Akihito's formal enthronement this afternoon, a temple employee
said. He said the prayers will continue until next month.
   The employee, who also requested that he not be named, said the
temple had not received any threatening phone calls from radicals.
   Enryakuji temple, recognized as one of the most venerable of
Japan's holy places, was originally built in 788. The hall that was
destroyed in today's fire had just been rebuilt two years ago.

   Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other Arab forces would
fight alongside U.S. troops to liberate Kuwait from Iraq, a senior
U.S. official said today near the end of a trip by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   However, the official said he was not sure whether France would
go along. Baker will meet with French President Francois Mitterrand
and Foreign Minister Roland Dumas in Paris on Saturday.
   ``I don't know where the French would be,'' said the official,
who briefed reporters under rules of anonymity. Baker left today
for London.
   As to the Soviets, ``they are not optimistic and indeed after
having sent two diplomatic missions of their own to Baghdad, I
think it's fair to say that they are disappointed in the lack of a
response that's been received,'' Baker said today.
   ``They're disappointed in the adamant attitude of Saddam Hussein
in refusing to comply with 10 United Nations resolutions. I think
they are as disappointed and as frustrated as most of the rest of
the world community,'' he said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Referring to Yevgeny Primakov, a Soviet Mideast expert who has
been dispatched twice to Baghdad by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the senior official told reporters, ``They sent an emissary and he
was stiffed.''
   Until now, the Soviets had hailed Primakov's trips as productive
and said they had given leaders cause for optimism. Over the last
several weeks the Soviets have raised hopes that a political
solution could avert military action in the Persian Gulf region.
   But on Thursday, for the first time publicly, they gave their
approval of the use of military force to get Iraq out of Kuwait if
peaceful pressure tactics fail.
   Baker has talked about a military option at every stop during
his travels to Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey and the Soviet
Union. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, during a
news conference with Baker Thursday, made no mention of military
action until he was pressed by reporters.
   ``Whether or not the use of force could be ruled out - probably
this could not be ruled out - and a situation may emerge which
effectively would require such a move,'' Shevardnadze said then.
   The official said Saudi officials during meetings last week were
``absolutely'' committed to fighting alongside U.S. troops.
``There's no doubt in my mind Saudi forces would be committed,'' he
said.
   Egyptians, ousted Kuwaitis and other Arab forces in the Gulf
region also would join with the United States, the official said.
   However, Syria was a puzzler. The official said he was not sure
what Syria would do, although ``they might lead the charge''
against Iraq.
   The United States had enlisted Syria in its makeshift alliance
despite U.S. allegations that the Damascus government has supported
terrorism.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad and Saddam lead rival factions of
the Ba'ath Party and are bitter enemies. Saddam already has linked
Syria's military presence in Lebanon to Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   Baker came to Moscow on Wednesday seeking at least Soviet
acquiescence if the Bush administration presented a resolution to
the United Nations Security Council to authorize the use of force
as a last resort to liberate Kuwait.
   But the official said Baker had not asked Gorbachev or Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze during their talks to support such a
resolution.
   ``We haven't even authorized the drafting of a resolution,'' the
official added.
   ``We think that a specific resolution of the security council
that leaves no doubt about that option (of force) would be
preferable from a political standpoint,'' Baker said today on NBC's
``Today'' show.
   ``That's not to say it's required. It's not a precondition,''
Baker said.
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen of China, one of five Security
Council members who could veto the resolution, told Baker Tuesday
in Cairo that Beijing would not block such a resolution.
   Meanwhile today, Baker acknowledged that a major arms control
agreement due for signing in 10 days at a Paris summit still was
not finished.
   Besides some technical issues, he said, neither side had
approved methods of verifying weapons reductions or paying the cost
of inspections.
   The treaty is the intended showcase of a 34-nation summit
meeting in Paris that President Bush is due to attend Nov. 19-21.
It would be the most comprehensive arms control accord in history,
encompassing Europe from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains
in the Soviet Union.
   Near the conclusion of Baker's 13 hours of talks on Thursday in
Moscow, the two sides managed to reach an agreement in principle on
deployment of tanks, anti-aircraft artillery and other non-nuclear
arms in four European zones.
   The arrangement needs the approval of Turkey and Norway. Baker
sent Ronald Lehman, director of the U.S. Arms Control Agency, to
Oslo, Norway, and Stephen Hadley, of the U.S. National Security
Council, to Ankara, Turkey, to consult with government leaders in
those capitals.
   Hanging in the balance also is another accord to cut U.S. and
Soviet long-range nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by 30
percent. Shevardnadze said there were ``some difficult problems''
with that pact, which Bush had hoped to sign at another summit
meeting this winter in Moscow.
   The outlook is clouded by disagreement over several issues,
including how much leeway the Soviets would have to keep testing
their SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles.

   Pawnshops are increasingly becoming home to the
gold that made the 1980s glitter as layoffs wrack Wall Street and
other industries.
   But after years of being rudely portrayed by Hollywood as a
usurious business preying on the impoverished, the pawnbroking
industry is loath to be seen as a leading recessionary indicator.
   Lincoln Square Pawnbrokers is an example of the boom. Newly
hard-pressed New Yorkers have contributed to a 10 percent jump in
unreclaimed valuables hocked this year at the tiny pawnshop.
   ``This is the largest increase in 15 years,'' said owner Gary
Kalter. He said gold jewelry is his most frequently pawned item.
   Kalter is not alone in reaping a windfall from the weak U.S.
economy. Many of the roughly 8,000 U.S. pawnbrokers report that
white-collar professionals who just a few years ago wouldn't be
caught dead near their shops are skulking in to hock their Rolex
watches, diamond rings and other symbols of the fast-cash '80s.
   Many of these former high-fliers - including lawyers, developers
and real estate agents - need cash to buy Christmas gifts or other
luxury items, but have exceeded their credit card limits.
   Typical of those doing a robust business is the 150-store Cash
America Investments Inc., which went public in 1987 and has grown
25 percent in each of the past five years.
   ``Our stores look like little Kmarts - well lit and
departmentalized,'' said Eugene Estep, vice president and director
of investor relations at the Fort Worth, Texas-based chain.
   Nevertheless, the pawnbroking industry would rather not
publicize its boon from hard times, and many brokers deny they are
benefiting from the slump. ``Our business is good in good times and
bad, and that's the reason we've been around for 2,000 years,''
Estep said.
   ``Our industry has had a PR problem,'' said Louise Seawright,
president of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based National Pawnbrokers
Association. ``Everyone watches TV and the media does have a way of
dictating a lot of the public's thinking.''
   Mindful of its image, the trade organization in New York State
recently changed its name from the Pawnbrokers Association to the
Collateral Loan Brokers Association of New York.
   And while business is booming across the nation, times are
decidedly mixed in New York City. Tough state regulations and high
rents have helped reduce the number of pawnshops from 120 in 1940
to 20 in 1980 to just 15 in 1990.
   The remaining shops have been left to split up New York's
bustling customer base, so stores now generally do a high-volume
but low-revenue business.
   Squeezed between a peep-show store and a Pizza Hut, S&amp;G Gross
Co. in midtown Manhattan writes about 100 loans a day, or about
25,000 a year, about the same as a small bank branch.
   A loyal customer base has helped the four-generation business
remain in the hands of Robert Gross, 71, and his son Gary, 46.
   S&amp;G's past is written both inside and out of the shop.
   On the sooty store front, three golden metal balls - the ancient
symbol for pawnbroking - hang below a two-sided neon sign:
``Loans.''
   Inside, on the wall of a narrow cluttered office is a
turn-of-the-century photo of a gas-lit banquet at the old Savoy
Hotel. Members of the state trade group, about 200 tuxedoed
pawnbrokers at five long tables, pose for the camera seated in
plush leather chairs.
   Among the men are Robert's father, Sol, then 30, and Robert's
grandfather, a burly man in his 50s with a Teddy Roosevelt-style
mustache and a confident visage.
   These days a less staid bunch, a dozen or so pawnbrokers
representing a dramatically smaller industry, meet under more
modest circumstances at less posh Manhattan restaurants.
   Tapping the shop's new $40,000 computer system, Gary notes that
keeping track of customers' loans has cut down on some of the
haggling.
   In another sign of changing times, the store several years ago
limited itself to selling jewelry, and it no longer deals in
household items customers could buy cheaper in department stores.
   ``You could see that advancements in electronics were making
items obsolete,'' Gary said. ``I said to myself, `Myself, this is
10 percent of the business and 90 percent of the aggravation.'''

   Tainted eye drops specially prepared by a
pharmacist caused a severe infection that cost one woman an eye and
similar infections in at least a dozen other people, doctors say.
   After the woman whose eye had to be removed came in for
treatment this week, surgeons at Allegheny General Hospital
discovered the drops were contaminated by a tenacious bacteria
called pseudomonas, Dr. John Kennerdell, chairman of the hospital's
ophthalmology department, said Thursday.
   ``Normally we don't find any bacteria in medication, but with
that specimen we found over 100 colonies,'' said Matthew Rigg, a
hospital lab technician. ``We couldn't believe how strong it was.''
   The prescription eye drops, prepared at Hieber's Drug Store by
pharmacist and owner Joseph Kilkeary, were designed to ease
inflammation after cataract surgery.
   ``I've been selling these drops for years without a problem,''
Kilkeary said.
   He said 20 to 25 customers bought the drops in October. They
have been told to quit using them and return them to the pharmacy
or their doctors.
   Thirteen people were hospitalized for treatment in Pittsburgh,
doctors said. One man who used the drops but shows no sign of
infection was under observation.
   Doctors removed the woman's right eye last week after
antibiotics failed. The other 12 are receiving large doses of
antibiotics. Two have impaired vision and could lose an eye,
Kennerdell said.
   ``Once this type of bacteria gains access to the inside of the
eye it causes a very devastating infection,'' he said. ``That's why
it's so dangerous.''
   The drops contain a liquid solution and Indocin, an
anti-inflammatory drug normally taken orally for arthritis.
   Pharmacists commonly mix solutions not offered by drug companies
when doctors prescribe them, said Harvey Miller, a Food and Drug
Administration spokesman in Philadelphia.
   The practice is legal, but the FDA will investigate the tainted
eye drop case, he said.
   Gary Bruell, a spokesman for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, the maker of
Indocin, said: ``We really can't comment on what physicians or
pharmacists may be doing with the product outside its current
labeling,'' he said.
   Kilkeary said he didn't know how the bottles became tainted. Lab
tests on bottles in the store found no contamination, he said.

   A 14-month-old girl who got up in
the middle of the night to play with her sister drowned in the
bathtub while her parents slept, a sheriff's spokesman said.
   Investigators believe Heather Mayhak and her 2-year-old sister
wanted to wash up after covering themselves with peanut butter and
spaghetti sometime before 2:45 a.m. Thursday.
   ``They were playing house,'' said Curt Benson of the Pierce
County sheriff's department.
   The baby's body was discovered after a neighbor in the apartment
below, Allen McCane, was awakened by water dripping from the
ceiling onto his face from the overflowing bathtub above.
   McCane said the parents came to the door with the 2-year-old,
then the father went looking for Heather. The girl was found
lifeless in the tub.
   A nurse who lived nearby and Fire Department paramedics tried to
resuscitate the girl, neighbors said. But she was pronounced dead a
short time later at a Tacoma hospital, Benson said.
   Benson said the parents were sleeping in their bedroom and
didn't hear the children playing in the living room.

<HEAD>Red Cross Says Government Planes Dropped Bombs on Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government plane dropped two bombs
on the recently reopened Jaffna hospital today, injuring five
civilians, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
   The aircraft circled above the hospital before dropping the
bombs, the Red Cross said in a statement. The first bomb fell just
outside the hospital grounds, it said.
   ``The second bomb fell within the clearly defined security
area,'' the Red Cross said. ``The roofs and windows of four
hospital buildings were also blown off due to the bomb
explosions.''
   The statement said five people were hurt in the attack, but it
was not immediately clear how seriously they were injured, or
whether the injured were patients or workers.
   The hospital is in Jaffna city, a stronghold of the Tamil Tiger
guerrillas on the northern Jaffna Peninsula.
   A senior military official in Colombo confirmed the Red Cross
had filed a complaint about the bombing, which the government was
checking. He said on condition of anonymity that the investigation
would take time.
   ``The ICRC made strong representations to Sri Lankan authorities
to again obtain firm guarantees that similar violations should not
reoccur,'' the Red Cross statement said.
   On Tuesday, the Red Cross announced it was reopening the
state-owned hospital, having notified the government and Tamil
rebels that the area had been declared a ``hospital zone.''
   The hospital and a ``safety area'' around it would be clearly
marked with red crosses for easy identification from the ground and
air, the Geneva-based organization said.
   The 1,200-bed hospital would also be under the protection of the
Red Cross and no armed personnel or military vehicles allowed
within its compound.
   The hospital was closed when the Tigers ended a 13-month
cease-fire in June and resumed their war for a Tamil homeland on
the Sinhalese-dominated island.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told Colombo-based
diplomats on Tuesday the government accepted the Red Cross
proposals for reopening the hospital.
   Elsewhere, four Tamil rebels and a soldier were killed in
fighting during the past 24-hours in the north and east of Sri
Lanka, military officials said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the 7-year-old Tamil
rebellion.

   Women candidates proved this week that they
can raise millions, play political hardball and win the big ones,
feminist fund-raisers and analysts say.
   ``We're no longer the not-ready-for-prime-time players,'' said
Jane Danowitz, executive director of the bipartisan Women's
Campaign Fund.
   ``The good old boys better watch out,'' said Sharon Rodine,
president of the National Women's Political Caucus, also a
bipartisan group. ``This is the start of something very big.''
   Start is the operative word.
   Though Democrat Ann Richards weighed in with a breakthrough
gubernatorial win in high-stakes Texas, the numbers of women at the
highest levels of government are the same or lower than before
Tuesday's elections: three governors, two senators and 28 House
members, down from 29.
   But Rodine said lower-level gains put women in position to
exploit dozens of open congressional seats expected to arise in
1992 as a result of redistricting and a last-chance opportunity
that year for retiring members to take their campaign war chests
with them.
   Among the statistics compiled by Rutgers University's Center for
the American Woman and Politics:
   -A record 85 women ran for statewide elective executive offices
and 47 won. Combined with 10 holdovers, women now hold 17 percent
of these offices.
   -A record 2,063 women sought state legislative seats - 210 more
than in 1988, the largest increase in recent elections. The
percentage of women state legislators is expected to rise about one
percentage point to 18 percent.
   ``The big story is not the numbers-crunching or just looking at
Capitol Hill,'' Rodine said. ``It's the new pool of women who
jumped in at the state and local level.''
   The feminist analysts cited exit poll findings that in many
races, women candidates attracted most of women's votes. They
attributed the gender gap largely to abortion and, to a lesser
extent, ``kitchen table'' issues such as education, drugs and jobs.
   ``Women's votes elected Ann Richards and probably other women,''
said Ruth Mandel, director of the Rutgers center.
   If women had been the only voters in California and North
Carolina, ``Dianne Feinstein would be packing up to move to
Sacramento and Harvey Gantt would be on his way to Washington,''
Mandel added, referring to the losing Democratic candidates for
California governor and North Carolina senator.
   Danowitz said the elections shattered a number of myths. She
said the hard-fought, mudslinging Richards race disproved ideas
that women can't win the big races, can't raise big money, can't
take the heat of political battle and can't attract the votes of
other women.
   In addition, Danowitz said, the week's elections raised the
number of female state attorneys general from one to four -
dispelling the notion that women are weak on crime.
   The election also boosted from 15 to 22 the number of women
holding state treasurer, auditor or comptroller posts, according to
the campaign fund's count. ``Voters entrusted their pocketbooks to
women,'' dissolving the myth that women are weak fiscal managers,
Danowitz said.
   Three Republican women who quit the House to challenge
Democratic senators won praise from the feminists although they all
lost badly.
   ``These women took a risk and should be applauded. We're going
to have to go after incumbents,'' said Rodine.
   Mandel said their risks were not in vain. ``I don't think there
are any automatic sacrificial lambs anymore. Even if they don't
make it this time, they have advanced themselves in some way,'' she
said.
   Ellen Malcolm, founder of the Democratic fund-raising group
EMILY's List, noted that despite the static overall number of women
in Congress, Democrats have made substantial gains.
   In 1972, she said, there were 14 Democratic women in the House
and in 1986 there were 12. ``We were losing ground. We have turned
that around. We now have 20. That's a two-thirds increase,''
Malcolm said.
   In 1992, she predicted, with the large number of open seats,
``you're going to see that line go straight up.''

<HEAD>Parliament Delays Considering Controversial Abortion Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament voted today to delay
considering a church-supported bill that would outlaw abortions,
which have been legal in Poland since 1956, and jail doctors who
perform them.
   The Sejm, or lower house, voted not to take up a draft bill
banning abortion that was passed by the Senate on Sept. 29.
   Instead, a motion was passed to put off the discussion until
after presidential elections on Nov. 25. A possible runoff is
scheduled for Dec. 9.
   Opponents of the abortion ban fear it will pass if it comes to a
direct vote, so they are trying to delay debate during the current
parliament term, which should end early next year.
   Calling for immediate consideration was Marek Jurek, of the
Citizen's Parliamentary Club, the caucus of deputies elected with
the backing of Solidarity. He said the abortion bill has nothing to
do with the presidential elections and that postponing it would be
perceived as foot-dragging.
   After the motion, proposed by 17 deputies, to consider the bill
today was defeated, the Sejm voted 140-93 with 49 abstentions to
delay debate until after the elections.
   The two main presidential candidates, Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa and Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, say they accept
church teachings and so support the legislation. The only candidate
opposing the legislation is leftist Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz.
   Legalized abortion was introduced by the country's former
Communist rulers in 1956 without a public debate.
   Although more than 90 percent of Poland's population is
Catholic, 800,000 abortions are performed annually, terminating an
estimated one in two pregnancies. Other forms of birth control are
not widely available.
   The bill would impose no criminal penalties for women who
undergo abortions, but doctors could be sentenced to three years in
prison.
   The bill provides for abortions only when a woman's life is
threatened or the pregnancy is a result of a rape or incest.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Raise Moral Questions On U.S. Involvement In
Persian Gulf</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic Archbishop Roger M. Mahony
offered qualified support to U.S. actions in the Middle East but
urged the government to consider the moral ramifications before
resorting to force.
   In a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Mahony
urged the Bush administration, ``in continued cooperation with the
United Nations, the Soviet Union, Arab states, and other nations
(to) stay the course of persistent, peaceful and determined
pressure against Iraq.''
   The Los Angeles archbishop wrote Baker on Wednesday as chairman
of the International Policy Committee of the U.S. Catholic
Conference. The letter was released Thursday.
   Mahony said the nation's 390 Roman Catholic bishops, spiritual
leaders of 55 million Catholics, support U.N. economic sanctions
against Iraq and condemn ``Iraqi aggression and the taking of
hostages'' after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But ethical considerations should not be ``ignored or neglected
in a focus on simple military and geopolitical considerations,''
Mahony said.
   ``Is the damage to be inflicted and the costs incurred by war
proportionate to the objectives to be achieved by taking up arms?''
he wrote. ``Will war with Iraq leave the people of Kuwait, the
Middle East and the world better or worse off?''
   ``We understand that a strong military presence can give
credibility to a vigorous pursuit of non-violent solutions to the
crisis,'' he said. But he added that he was concerned that the
pressure to use military force may grow as efforts to pursue
non-violent options ``almost inevitably become difficult, complex
and slow.''
   ``As Catholic bishops, we are deeply concerned about the human
consequences of the crisis - the lives already lost or those that
could be lost in a war, the freedom denied to hostages, the victims
of aggression and the many families divided by the demands of
military service,'' he said.
   In September, Mahony wrote the administration requesting that
the trade embargo against Iraq not include essential food and
medicine for civilians.
   In the letter released Thursday, the archbishop cited so-called
``just war'' criteria outlined in the U.S. bishops' Pastoral Letter
on War and Peace released in May 1983.
   That letter emphasizes that Catholic tradition does not rule out
the use of force absolutely, but it does make a clear presumption
against war. U.S. policy-makers should consider whether their goals
justify the use of force, Mahony said.
   Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, president of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops, has said he was praying
for a peaceful solution so ``that the soldiers, sailors and air men
of all forces now arrayed in the region may soon be restored to
their families.''

   An official Iraqi newspaper said today the
foreign minister held secret talks with a former French government
official, Claude Cheysson, that led to the release of more than 300
French hostages.
   The paper, Al-Jumhouriya, said the talks were endorsed by the
French government. On Thursday, French Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas denied Cheysson had a mandate from the government to
negotiate the release of French hostages.
   The Iraqi daily did not say when or where the alleged meeting
between Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and Cheysson took place, but
Arab diplomats said the two met in Tunis. They said the Palestine
Liberation Organization opened the way for talks, held just one
week before the Frenchmen were released.
   Cheysson is a former French foreign minister.
   In late October, President Saddam Hussein freed French
nationals, saying France was trying in good faith to find a
solution to the 3-month-old gulf crisis. Some said it was a move to
divide the world alliance against Iraq.
   Western officials have criticized efforts by other former
leaders - including Edward Heath of Britain, Yasuhiro Nakasone of
Japan, and Willy Brandt of Germany - to free Western captives. All
have met with some success.
   Their governments, however, have denied that any deals were
struck in exchange for the release of hostages. The former
politicians have maintained they were acting purely on humanitarian
grounds.

   Israeli troops today attacked suspected Shiite
Moslem guerrilla bases north of Israel's ``security zone'' in
southern Lebanon after officials guaranteed the safety of
Christians living nearby.
   The army said tanks, paratroopers and infantry units moved
against strongholds near the towns of Jaba, Kfar Milki and Mazraat
Ayn Abu Siwar.
   The statement said the areas were used by Hezbollah militia to
launch attacks against Israeli troops and the South Lebanon Army
militia, which is trained and financed by Israel.
   The bases were damaged and there were no Israeli casualties,
according to the army. It gave no information about possible
Hezbollah casualties.
   The attacks occurred five to eight miles west of Jezzine, a
largely Christian town 12 miles from the northern tip of the
security zone, which was created by Israel in 1985 after it
withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon.
   Although Jezzine is patrolled by the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army militia, fears have arisen recently that the Lebanese
government's plan to rid Beirut of Moslem militias could push them
southward and threaten the town.
   On a visit to south Lebanon on Thursday, Defense Minister Moshe
Arens promised that the Israeli army will do whatever is necessary
to protect Jezzine, army radio said.
   ``We will do what is needed in order to ensure that the control
over these areas is not harmed,'' Arens was quoted as saying. He
did not elaborate.
   Danny Neveh, an aide to Arens, said today the defense minister
was trying to make it clear what Israel's security concerns are,
given the possible changes in Beirut.
   ``Israel's main interest is the security of its northern
border,'' Neveh said. ``This means we are not going to allow
anything that may threaten our interest in security zone and in the
Jezzine area.''
   He declined to say whether this meant Israel was willing to
commit troops if Jezzine were threatened.
   Neveh also said there was no move to expand the security zone to
include Jezzine.
   Arens, who was accompanied Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the army's
chief of staff, made the promise to the SLA commander, Gen. Antoine
Lahad, the radio said.
   Lahad was quoted in Thursday's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper as
saying he would fight to keep other militias out of Jezzine.
   ``In the present situation, where there is no state of Lebanon,
I will refuse any entry of Lebanese forces into Jezzine,'' Lahad
said.
   The Al Hamishmar and Hadashot newspapers quoted senior Israeli
army officers as saying Israel now considers Jezzine ``a red line''
not to be passed by Lebanese or Syrian forces.
   They were quoted as saying Israel was ``changing the map'' of
the security zone. Israel, however, has announced no official
extension of its zone.
   Lahad has long wanted Jezzine incorporated into the security
zone and recently told Israeli correspondents that the town was
``an inseparable part'' of the zone.
   Hadashot reported that Lahad was sending his best troops to
protect Jezzine.

<TEXT>
   A Dallas County judge dismissed eight misdemeanor
obscenity charges againt a music store chain in an agreement with
prosecutors under which the chain will stop selling an album by rap
group 2 Live Crew.
   Sound Warehouse Inc. will stop selling the album ``As Nasty As
They Wanna Be,'' said Gerald H. Goldstein, an attorney for the
chain. The album was deemed obscene by a federal judge in Florida.
   Dallas County Criminal Court Judge George Shepherd said he
dropped the charges Thursday at the request of prosecutors.
   Assistant District Attorney David Pickett got statewide news
coverage when he announced at a July news conference that his
office would file charges against Sound Warehouse for distributing
the album.
   ``One of the wags in the courthouse thought it was curious that
it happened two days after the election,'' Shepherd said. Pickett
lost his bid for a district court seat in Tuesday's election.
   The rap album's lyrics, which prompted protests nationwide,
include more than 200 lewd words and phrases, Pickett said then.
   Pickett did not immediately return a phone call from The
Associated Press.
   Sound Warehouse maintains a published policy of not selling
adult-oriented materials to minors, Goldstein said.
   ``The DA's office probably decided it was time to get on to
protecting the citizens of Dallas from real criminals on the
street,'' Goldstein said. ``With Sound Warehouse, we are talking
about a responsible retail outlet.''
   In Florida, a record store owner was convicted last month of
misdemeanor obscenity for selling the album, but members of the
Miami-based group were acquitted in a separate trial of obscenity
charges stemming from a live performance at a nightclub.

<TEXT>
   The Dutch Reformed Church joined
other Christian denominations today in rejecting apartheid as a sin
and confessed the church's role in implementing the system of
legalized segregation.
   The Dutch Reformed Church, the main church of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who control the government, had argued
for decades that the Bible supported apartheid. That position
isolated it from other denominations.
   But at the end of a weeklong conference of 90 Christian
churches, leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church joined in supporting
a statement condemning church participation in apartheid.
   ``We confess our own sin and acknowledge our heretical part in
the policy of apartheid which has led to such extreme suffering,''
the joint statement said. `We denounce apartheid in its intention,
its implementation, and its consequences as an evil policy.''
   The conference in Rustenburg, 60 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, was the largest ever gathering of Christian churches
in South Africa.
   The so-called Rustenburg Document also recommended that the
government remove all apartheid laws, set up a one-person, one-vote
democracy, seek equitable wealth distribution, restore land to
blacks, and arrange an affirmative action program to advance
blacks.
   Rev. Peter Potgieter, head of the Dutch Reformed Church, said
his church agreed with the basic message of the document, but not
with some of the details. He declined to be more specific, but it
appeared his reservations were with the specific political
recommendations in the document.
   He cautioned that the document was not official church policy,
which must be decided by the church's synod.
   Nonetheless, the church's participation in the conference and
its general support for the final document was its strongest
repudiation of apartheid to date. The church first said apartheid
was wrong several years ago but had not declared it a sin or
confessed its role in building the system.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, leader of the South African Council of
Churches, praised the document but said he understood the Dutch
Reformed Church's hesitation to give it full support.
   ``I feel that we have started a process, and I'm just hoping the
Dutch Reformed Church will be able to move ahead with us,'' he
said. ``I understand they're constrained, they have to answer back
to their own membership.''
   The Rustenburg Document did not cite the Dutch Reformed Church
by name. It said all South African churches should have done more
to resist apartheid.
   ``Some of us actively misused the Bible to justify apartheid,
leading many to believe that it had the sanction of God,'' it said.
   Other churches, the document said, ignored apartheid by
preaching the ``sufficiency of individual salvation without social
transformation.''
   ``We adopted an allegedly neutral stance which in fact resulted
in complicity with apartheid,'' it said.
   Still other churches condemned apartheid but did little to
resist, the statement said.
   Virtually all South Africa's leading clergymen attended the
conference, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and
Chikane.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition
to apartheid, said he accepted the repentance: ``The confession is
not cheaply made, and my response is not cheaply made,'' he said.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church has about 1
million members, including President F.W. de Klerk and most of the
Cabinet.
   There are separate branches for blacks and people of mixed-race,
which have staunchly opposed apartheid.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church said last month it
wants to merge with its sister churches, but no action has been
taken.
   De Klerk has promised to dismantle apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution that will allow the 5 million whites and 30 million
blacks to share power.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo fired a Cabinet
minister today and canceled plans to build a nuclear waste dump to
restore order on an island where thousands of people rioted to
protest the proposed dump.
   Today, during the the second day of rioting on Anmyon Island,
police fired tear gas to break up a rally by several hundred
people.
   About 3,000 troops erected roadblocks and patrolled the scenic
island off the nation's central west coast to prevent further
violence among its 50,000 residents. Most shops and schools were
closed and many people stayed home.
   South Korea's most serious anti-nuclear protest was mounted by
villagers who accused the government of ignoring their demands not
to build the waste dump. The protests began peacefully earlier this
week after publication of a newspaper report about the government's
plans for the dump.
   South Korea has nine nuclear power plants in operation and plans
to build more. Previous protests have involved minor clashes or
peaceful rallies.
   The rioting on Anmyon prompted government officials to announce
today they were scuttling plans for the dump. Roh fired his
minister of science and technology, Chung Kun-mo, and the island's
police chief, both of whom he held responsible for the unrest.
   Roh named Kim Jin-hyon, 56, a managing director of the Dong-A
Ilbo newspaper, to succeed Chung.
   Police said 73 people were arrested on Thursday and charged with
inciting riots. They said hundreds of firebombs were confiscated.
   Several dozen people were reported injured in a day-long rampage
that began early Thursday. Two policemen were in serious condition
with head injuries inflicted by stick-wielding protesters on
Thursday, news reports said.
   Witnesses said the violence began with an early morning rally
Thursday by 3,000 people. The number quickly swelled to 10,000 as
primary, middle and high school students boycotted classes and
joined in the protest.
   Protesters set fire to a police station and a district
government office on Thursday, the witnesses said. They held eight
government officials for two hours, forcing them to strip to their
underpants before freeing them.
   Late Thursday, about 2,500 riot police firing tear gas took
control of several government offices and police stations occupied
by the protesters, who bombarded them with firebombs and rocks, the
witnesses said.
   They said the protest calmed shortly before midnight when the
police retreated and the government announced it would not build
the waste dump.
   Police used tear gas again today to break up a rally by several
hundred villagers who shouted anti-government and anti-nuclear
slogans.
   More police contingents were sent to arrest protest leaders
today.
   Police were ordered to track down radical students to determine
if they instigated the riot.

   The opposition Labor Party's easy victory in two
special parliamentary elections is prompting renewed speculation of
an imminent challenge to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
leadership of the Conservative Party.
   In the most humiliating result from Thursday's voting, the
Conservatives slumped to third place behind the centrist Liberal
Democrats in Bradford North, a district the Conservatives had
controlled in the early 1980s.
   Laborite Terry Rooney, 39, won by 52 percent of the vote to hold
Bradford North with 9,514-vote majority, up from a slim 1,663-vote
margin in Britain's 1987 general election.
   In the northwest England dockland town of Bootle, a socialist
stronghold, Labor's Joe Benton gathered 22,052 votes, some nine
times as many as the second-placed Conservatives' 2,587.
   The elections - caused by the deaths of the previous legislators
in the two districts - were the first since Mrs. Thatcher's deputy,
Sir Geoffrey Howe, quit last week.
   Howe resigned in protest of Mrs. Thatcher's resistance to a
drive for closer union of the European Community.
   ``I think out there we're not very popular at the moment,''
Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker said of the result of
Thursday's ballot in Bradford North.
   Baker blamed continuing high interest rates as the government
pursues a long struggle to bring down Britain's 10.9 percent
inflation rate and the upheaval over Howe's resignation.
   He maintained the party did not want or need a leadership
election.
   But Conservative legislator Tony Marlow said pressure would
increase pressure for a challenge to Mrs. Thatcher at the annual
leadership election this month.
   ``I think there will be a new prime minister before Christmas,''
Marlow said.
   He is the most outspoken among rank-and-file Conservative
legislators fearful of losing their seats at the next election,
which must be held by mid-1992.
   The leadership election, in which Conservative legislators vote,
is scheduled for Nov. 20.
   Apart from a feeble challenge last year, Mrs. Thatcher has been
reelected annually as the sole nominee since she became party
leader in 1975.
   Thatcher loyalists joined Baker in trying to quench the
speculation.
   ``We are worried, of course, that we may not win the next
election,'' said legislator Ivor Lawrence. ``But we are not worried
that we must look for somebody to replace Mrs. Thatcher.''
   In Bradford North, the Tory vote crumbled in a huge 23 percent
swing against the government. The Tories got 6,048 votes, well
behind the Liberal Democrats' 9,105.
   In national opinion polls, the Conservatives are trailing
between 12 and 20 points behind Labor.
   Mrs. Thatcher still has solid control of the 650-member House of
Commons. The Conservatives have 373 seats, Labor 227 and the
Liberal Democrats 20. Other seats are held by minority regional
parties.

<HEAD>Daily News Unions Say They're Willing To Accept Pay Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

   Striking Daily News workers are ready to take
the same pay cuts that their colleagues at the Post accepted two
months ago, the newspaper unions' leader announced.
   George McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades
Council, made the announcement Thursday after News publisher James
Hoge said that union negotiators had offered only small concessions
during the 10 months of negotiations that preceded the strike.
   McDonald, head of the 10-union coalition of workers at both the
News and the Post, responded, ``Go back and say to Hoge that
McDonald said at a press conference: `We'll match what we gave the
Post.'''
   News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said that McDonald, ``should
learn that the place for negotiations is at the bargaining table,
not at a news conference.''
   In September, nine of the 10 unions agreed to nearly $20 million
in wage cuts at the Post after publisher Peter Kalikow said the
only alternative was to close the paper. Many employees agreed to a
20 percent pay cut by switching to a four-day work week.
   McDonald said of the Post: ``They came to us very honestly and
said, `Look, we've lost some $29 million this year, we'll show it
to you.' We saw their books. We believed them.''
   ``Now the same people who are members of our unions would do the
same thing at the Daily News if they had the opportunity,''
McDonald said. ``Do you think they like to be out on strike?''
   The News strike began Oct. 25 with a dispute at the paper's
Brooklyn plant. Some deliverers walked off the job; the News
responded by bringing in replacement workers.
   The walkout spread to eight of nine other unions at the paper.
The unions, representing 2,100 workers, had been working without
contracts since March 30.
   Finding a Daily News in the city remained a challenge today as
the strike against the tabloid entered day 16, with newsstand
vendors saying the threat of union retribution has convinced them
to shun the paper.
   ``Nobody's selling the Daily News. The unions, they are coming
every day and checking,'' said Shamini Khan, owner of a newsstand
at 49th Street and Broadway. ``I want to sell it but it's risky.
I'm scared.''
   A Thursday morning spot check of outlets in lower and midtown
Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn found dealers almost bereft of the
paper. Hoge said Wednesday that 600,000 papers were being printed
each day, with two-thirds of those finding their way to readers.
   Pre-strike circulation was about 1.09 million copies daily,
making the News the nation's third largest metropolitan daily. Hoge
said deliveries were being made to about 2,000 of the more than
12,000 normal outlets.

   Martin Luther King Jr. borrowed words and ideas
extensively from other sources for his doctoral dissertation and
other writings without giving proper citations, a Stanford
University historian says.
   ``Several of King's academic papers, as well as his
dissertation, contain numerous appropriated passages that can be
defined as plagiarism,'' historian Clayborne Carson said in a story
The Wall Street Journal published today.
   The slain civil rights leader's widow, Coretta Scott King, chose
Carson to lead the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which she
founded in 1984 to gather his papers from locations around the
country and produce a multivolume collection.
   Mrs. King's spokesman, Steve Klein, said today that she was
aware of the newspaper story but had no immediate comment on it.
   King's school papers are his most obscure and insignificant
writings, but the discoveries have prompted debate, anguish and
soul-searching among scholars who have worked on the project.
   Associate Editor Ralph Luker, a follower of King who was jailed
during a civil rights protest, said he suffered ``deep anxieties''
over the findings and ``many hours of lost sleep.''
   David Garrow, a member of the project's advisory board and
author of ``Bearing the Cross,'' a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography
of King, said the discovery ``had a tremendously shaking, emotional
impact on me.''
   ``To me, 98 percent of what makes it most interesting is: Why
did he do it? Was he so insecure that he thought this was the only
way to get by? It's disconcerting, because it is fundamentally,
phenomenally out of character with my entire sense of the man.''
   The questions about his academic work surfaced in late 1987,
nearly 20 years after his death, when evidencewas discovered by a
Stanford graduate student who was working for the King Papers
Project.
   In some parts of the dissertation King wrote as a doctoral
candidate at Boston University, he lifted passages nearly verbatim
from other texts without using any quotation marks or footnotes,
the Journal reported.
   After that discovery, Carson told his staff to check the sources
of nearly of all King's academic work.
   It became apparent that throughout his seven years of graduate
school, King's essays, especially in his major field of graduate
study, systematic theology, often borrowed from other sources
without citing them as required by academic policy, the Journal
reported.
   When the problem was found, three project editors and a
half-dozen student researchers worked for nearly two years
annotating all of King's 150 or so academic papers.
   Carson said King likely did not intentionally do anything wrong
by sometimes failing to attribute materials in his writing.
   ``The best evidence for that,'' he said, ``is that he saved his
papers and donated them to an archive - at B.U. of all places.''

   A toxic chemical has leaked into a river in
Byelorussia and Latvia, forcing the shutoff of drinking water to at
least two cities and tainting the river for hundreds of miles,
officials said today.
   The leak apparently came from the national government's Chemical
and Petrochemical Ministry, which produces chemicals for military
weapons, said Viktor Yukhno, the controller at Latvia's government
water authority.
   City and republic leaders said officials never informed them of
the leak into the Daugava River, which occurred sometime between
Oct. 31 and Nov. 5.
   ``It is just the same as Chernobyl. We only learned that
something went wrong when we saw fish floating belly up down the
stream,'' said Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ilmar Bisher,
referring to the 1983 nuclear power plant disaster in the Ukraine.
   He said two men suffered minor poisoning after eating fish.
   ``We hope there will be no more cases,'' said Bisher, head of a
Latvian commission investigating the leak.
   Drinking water from the river to the Latvian capital, Riga, a
city of nearly 1 million people, was turned off Thursday morning,
said Yukhno.
   The city's residents have been using water from underground
wells, but pumps are not powerful enough to bring water to taller
buildings and many residents remain without water, Yukhno said. The
city gets about a third of its water from the river.
   It is not known when Riga's water supply from the river will be
turned back on, but Bisher said it should take 10 days for all the
contaminated water to flow out to sea and clean water to refill
city's reservoir.
   Water also was cut to Daugapils, a city of 150,000 about 120
miles east of Riga, and crews have trucked in water for the city
and other areas, Bisher said. He said much of the contamination
already has passed Daugavpils and water may be turned back on by
Saturday, he said.
   The plant is located in the Byelorussian town of Novopolotsk,
480 miles upriver from Riga, and 880 miles west of Moscow, said
Yukhno.
   The chemical was a component of cyanide, Yukhno said, but
officials were still testing it to determine exactly what kind.
   There was no immediate word on how the leak occurred or if
chemicals were still being spilled, and no cleanup efforts were
reported. Neither plant officials nor the official state press have
commented on the incident.
   ``This does not only affect Riga, but the whole (republic),''
said Riga Mayor Andris Inkulis in Stockholm, Sweden, where he was
visiting. ``We warned people over television and radio so they
could save some water.''
   Local officials were still testing the chemical and trying to
determine how much had leaked. Inkulis said unofficial reports on
the leakage range from three tons to up to 60 tons.
   Yukhno said it was impossible to determine how many people may
be affected in Latvia or Byelorussia, because many have begun using
well water.
   Riga is the largest city on the river, lying at its mouth on the
Baltic Sea. But hundreds, possibly thousands, of other people live
in areas along the river and traditionally used the river for food
and drinking water.

   Germany today marked a year since the opening of
the Berlin Wall, a joyful anniversary interlocked with a bitter
one: the night in 1938 when breaking glass heralded the Holocaust,
war and German partition.
   Officials of newly united Germany also warmly welcomed Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who arrived in Bonn today to a 27-man military honor
guard.
   The Soviet president's visit is highly symbolic since his
reforms helped collapse the Iron Curtain and open the Berlin Wall.
   He was to sign a 20-year German-Soviet non-aggression treaty and
was expected to receive financial aid for his nation's troubled
economy.
   Commemorations of the wall's opening were to include the
unveiling of a monument at one of the former crossing points
between East and West Berlin, and a ceremony to honor the more than
200 people killed trying to escape East Germany.
   At the same time, Germany's Jewish community held memorial
ceremonies on the 52nd anniversary of attacks on synagogues, Jewish
homes and businesses known as Kristallnacht - Crystal Night -
because of all the glass shattered by Nazi thugs.
   By the time World War II ended seven years later with Germany's
division, 6 million Jews had been killed, many rounded up in full
view of fellow Germans and transported to death camps.
   Heinz Galinski, a Jewish leader in Germany, said many Germans
``have never accepted Nov. 9 as a day of commemoration'' though it
led to the Holocaust.
   The mayors of West Berlin and East Berlin, Walter Momper and
Tino Schwierzina, said in a joint statement Thursday the two Nov. 9
anniversaries should remind Germans of the need to fight against
oppression of minorities.
   They called for the public to participate in national affairs as
``the best protection against against misuse of state power.''
   Jochen Feilcke, a member of parliament from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democrats party, called ``completely erroneous''
statements from Communists that former East German officials played
a major role in opening the wall.
   ``Berliners streamed that night to the border crossings and took
over the wall at the Brandenburg Gate,'' he said.
   Last week, a report in the newspaper of the former Communist
Party, Neues Deutschland, said medium-level East German security
officers decided to let the pressing crowds through the wall,
fearing border guards would be killed otherwise.
   Guenter Schabowski, a member of the then ruling East German
Communist Politburo, also said last year the East German government
had intended to allow its citizens to travel abroad before the wall
opened. Portions of a news conference by Schabowski was planned to
be broadcast over loudspeakers late today in the central square in
East Berlin.
   The Bundesrat, the upper house of Parliament, was to mark the
wall anniversary by holding its first meeting in Berlin in 31
years, moving from Bonn, the federal capital.
   The two Germanys united Oct. 3 into a country of nearly 80
million people, by far the biggest in Europe. Their leaders pledged
repeatedly that the new Germany will not seek to dominate the
continent, nor would it forget the Nazi part of its history.
   Television news programs Thursday ran long recapitulations of
the celebrations that erupted at the Brandenburg Gate last Nov. 9
when it became known that East Germans were free to travel to the
West.
   One year ago, massive pro-democracy demonstrations and the
flight of refugees to the West prompted East Germany's Communist
leaders to begin opening the Berlin Wall. Hundreds of people
spontaneously climbed the 11{-foot wall that symbolized the
divisions of Germany and Europe.
   Shedding tears of happiness, some began using hammers and
chisels on the concrete barrier; soon a thriving business was
started selling chips of the wall as souvenirs.
   Bulldozers have finished removing 81 percent of the wall from
downtown Berlin, and have about two miles to go, officials say.
   Elections in East Germany early this year booted the Communists
from four decades of power, leading to last month's unification.
The first unified German parliamentary elections are Dec. 2.
   The sweeping change, however, has been painful for many former
East Germans as the switch to capitalism has caused inefficient
businesses to shut down, causing rising unemployment.

   The man accused of assassinating Rabbi Meir
Kahane may have been taking an anti-depressant drug that critics
claim induces violent behavior, according to a published report.
   The New York Times in today's editions quoted an unnamed law
enforcement source as saying that the accused, El Sayyid Nosair,
was taking Prozac. Officer Hugh Barry, a police spokesman, said
today he could not confirm the report.
   Several lawsuits are pending against the drug's manufacturer,
Eli Lilly &amp; Co., which has denied allegations that the drug can
induce suicidal or homicidal behavior. The Food and Drug
Administration also has found no link.
   Nosair, 34, who has denied fatally shooting the radical rabbi in
a Manhattan hotel on Monday night, entered no plea at his
arraignment in Bellevue Hospital's intensive care unit. Nosair was
shot in the throat by a U.S. Postal Service police officer after
the incident.
   In Waterbury, Conn., FBI agents, New York City detectives and
local police searched the home of a man they described as a friend
of Nosair. No arrests were made Thursday night. Neither the man's
identity nor the address was disclosed.
   ``The gunman had a connection in Waterbury,'' said Waterbury
Chief of Detectives John Griffin. ``He has a friend, a Moslem. They
both met in a mosque. We searched the man's house. I can't say if
we found anything.''
   New York police have said they believe Nosair acted alone, but
are not aware of his motive.
   The 58-year-old Kahane was the American-born rabbi who founded
the anti-Arab Kach Party in Israel and the militant Jewish Defense
League in this country. His killing Monday night touched off
anti-Arab riots in Israel.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Thursday that relatives
told police they thought Nosair had been under a doctor's care.
Barry said police believe he was being treated for depression.
   Nosair was on documented sick leave from his job with the city's
Department of General Services five days last week, said department
spokesman John Beckman. The diagnosis was confidential, Beckman
said.
   Borrelli speculated that Nosair, a native Egyptian who has an
engineering degree, may have felt frustrated because he couldn't
fulfill his potential in this country.
   Nosair began working for the General Services in April 1988,
repairing heating and cooling systems in courthouses.
   In addition, Nosair injured his hand or arm in an accident at
work in which he was nearly electrocuted, Borrelli said.
   The combined stress ``was acting on him; he wasn't getting
ahead,'' Borrelli theorized.
   New York Newsday quoted an unidentified source as saying that
Nosair threw a tantrum in a locker room Monday because he was being
transferred to Brooklyn. Beckman confirmed that Nosair was to be
transferred from Mahattan to Brooklyn, effective Thursday, but both
he and Borrelli said they had no evidence that Nosair had a tantrum
over it.
   ``It wasn't punitive,'' said Beckman. ``He was a satisfactory
worker.''
   Beckman said the department has 108 other employees who do the
same job as Nosair. ``These guys take these jobs with the
understanding they will be transferred. Of the 109, last year there
were 61 transfers.''
   Borrelli said police have found a car, registered to Nosair in
New Jersey, parked a few blocks from the midtown hotel where Kahane
was murdered.
   On Wednesday, the Department of General Services suspended him
without pay until further notice, based on his alleged criminal
activity and because he allegedly used a false Brooklyn address.
   Though his job has a New York City residency requirement, Nosair
lives in Cliffside Park, N.J., Beckman said.

   King Birendra, whose grip on absolute
power was shaken by a springtime pro-democracy uprising, today
enacted a constitution reducing his powers.
   The new document establishes a constitutional monarchy and
declares the Himalayan nation a multiparty democracy.
   It abolishes the old system under which political parties were
banned and the king ruled with a non-partisan legislature that
routinely approved measures favored by the monarch.
   ``I feel very much elated on such a historic occasion for which
the people have been aspiring and have laid down their lives,''
Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai told a news conference.
   The draft of a proposed constitution was completed two months
ago, but enactment bogged down in a tug-of-war between the palace
and Bhattarai's fledging government over how much power the king
should retain.
   Bhattarai said the king agreed to act in the same fashion as
Britain's constitutional monarchy.
   He said general elections will be held sometime between
mid-April and early May next year.
   In a message broadcast live on national radio and television,
Birendra said the new constitution ``will help to forge the people
in a bond of unity and advance the cause of multiparty democracy in
a constitutional monarchy.''
   He said the document takes effect immediately.
   The adoption of the new constitution culminates a pro-democracy
campaign that began in late winter with weeks of strikes and street
demonstrations by doctors, lawyers, students and the long-banned
political parties.
   The turning point came on April 6 when police opened fire as
200,000 demonstrators marched to the royal palace. At least 72
people were killed, according to official accounts. Witnesses put
the death toll at more than 300.
   Shortly afterward, the king caved in to pressure and asked
Bhattarai, a top leader of the Nepali Congress Party, to form an
interim government until elections could be held in the spring of
1991.
   The Nepali Congress Party and all other political parties were
banned by Birendra's father, King Mahendra, when he ended an
18-month experiment with democracy in December 1960.
   Birendra was crowned king in 1972 when his father died. He is
the latest monarch in the 223-year-old Shah dynasty.
   The new constitution declares Nepal a ``Hindu and constitutional
monarchical kingdom.'' The Buddhist and Christian minorities had
sought to have Nepal declared a secular state.
   Hindus comprise 90 percent of Nepal's 17 million people. Moslems
make up 5 percent, while Christians comprise 3 percent. Most of the
others are Buddhists.
   Under the new constitution, Nepal will have a two-house
Parliament consisting of a policy-making House of Representatives
and an upper house called the National Council.
   All 205 members of the House of Representatives and 35 of the 45
members of the National Council will be elected. The remaining 10
members of the upper house will be appointed by the king.

   West Virginia teachers who staged an
11-day wildcat strike this year won a major victory today when the
state Supreme Court ruled a county judge had no right to order them
back to work.
   The five justices unanimously overruled Kanawha County Circuit
Judge John Hey's statewide back-to-work order. The opinion written
by Justice W.T. Brotherton Jr. said Hey had no jurisdiction to
issue an order that would affect the rights of teachers outside
Kanawha County.
   It said Hey's action was precluded by a 1981 state law.
   ``We're pleased with the decision and we feel the Supreme Court
has certainly acted appropriately and that Judge Hey was out of
line,'' said Kayetta Meadows, president of the West Virginia
Education Association.
   Teachers struck over low pay March 7. On March 16, Hey issued an
injunction telling the strikers to return to work statewide.
   Meadows and other educators filed a petition with the Supreme
Court the same day, asking it to annul Hey's order. The teachers
returned to work two days later.
   After the teachers returned to work two days later, the union
asked the Supreme Court to dismiss their petition. But the court
decided to consider the issue the teachers raised.
   ``Although the present situation clearly results in a waste of
judicial resources, we do not believe that the circuit court of one
county has the authority to enjoin the acts of citizens occurring
in other counties, except where the judge of the other county is
interested in the proceeding and unable to act,'' Brotherton wrote.
   In an unusual twist, the court used the opinion to lecture both
sides.
   ``All parties to this strike must realize that ultimately, our
state's plans for an economic renaissance depend upon our children
and their ability to cope with the complex issues that will face
them,'' the opinion said.
   ``Unfortunately, work stoppages which involve the public
schools, regardless of merit or length, serve only to harm the
children of this state,'' Brotherton wrote.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   Iraq says it will never pull out of Kuwait, despite the U.S.
order to ship additional troops to the Persian Gulf and Moscow's
qualified consent to the use of force in the region.
   ``There is no reason for this force, or the previous force,''
Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohamed Al-Mashat, said Thursday
on CBS' ``America Tonight.'' ``We haven't done anything to the
United States.''
   ``Believe you me, we will never surrender or capitulate,'' he
said.
   ---
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday new U.S. troop
deployments to the Persian Gulf will include half of all American
land forces in Europe. That means as many as 200,000 more Americans
are being sent to the area.
   Cheney's estimate of the Army forces being moved from Germany
suggests an additional 100,000 ground troops are heading to the
gulf. That indicates the total new deployment ordered by Bush would
approach 200,000, including an Army division from the United
States, at least 20,000 sailors and at least 45,000 Marines.
   ---
   Iraq's government-run newspaper said Friday that Iraq and France
conducted secret talks that led to the release of more than 300
Frenchmen from Iraq.
   The paper, Al-Jumhouriya, said the talk between Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz and former French Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson were endorsed by the French government. France has denied
any deals were struck in exchange for release of the hostages.
   ---
   In Moscow, a senior U.S. official said Friday that Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and other Arab forces would fight alongside U.S. troops to
free Kuwait. But the official said the extent of France's support
is not known.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew from Moscow to London
Friday on his mission to strengthen allied resolve against Iraq's
3-month-old occupation of Kuwait. Baker will meet Saturday with
French leaders in Paris.
   ---
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt was scheduled to
leave Baghdad Friday night with 170 Westerners, including 120
Germans. Diplomats said five Americans were on the list.
   In a more personal attempt to influence Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, 11 British women flew to Baghdad to seek the release of
their captive husbands and relatives - against the advice of their
government.

   Two brothers who suffered broken bones in a
plane crash hiked for four days through the wet, cold Chiricahua
Mountains before being rescued, authorities said.
   Robert Rowe, 52, hampered by a broken wrist, nose and ribs, and
Carl Rowe, 37, who suffered a broken foot and wrist, hiked 14 to 16
miles through rugged terrain before finding a road and hailing a
ride to safety Thursday.
   Devorie Griffiths, co-owner of the Portal store and cafe in this
small town near the New Mexico state line, said the two men were
caked with dried blood when they hobbled into the store about 9
a.m.
   ``They were pretty cut up but they appeared to be in pretty good
spirits. They were glad to be out of there,'' she said. ``It's a
miracle they are alive.''
   The Rowes were flown by helicopter to Tucson Medical Center,
where they were listed in satisfactory condition today.
   The Phoenix men were flying their single-engine Cessna 182 into
canyons scouting for deer Sunday when they found themselves without
room to maneuver. Carl Rowe, who was the pilot, was forced to crash
land the plane.
   ``It was the best landing you could have made between two
trees,'' said Robert Rowe.
   It rained and snowed in parts of the Chiricahuas this week, and
a storm front had dropped nighttime temperatures into the 20s and
30s. The men drank from streams but had no food.
   Russ Griffiths, an emergency medical technician who helped the
men, said they were ``very cold and very wet. They appeared to be
in the early stages of hypothermia and we worked to stabilize them
so they would not go into shock.''
   ``They had been hallucinating. They said they saw people -
especially children - walking around in front of them,'' he said.
   Wreckage of the single-engine plane was spotted Wednesday by a
hunter, but the bad weather hampered efforts by searchers who had
been looking for the men since the plane was reported missing
Sunday night.

   No federal judge in the country could impartially
hear the case of a man charged in mail bombings that killed a
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer, the man's lawyers say.
   Attorneys for Walter Leroy Moody Jr. asked in a court motion
Thursday that the Senate Judiciary Committee appoint two
independent officers to hear the case.
   That a federal judge was one of the victims damages the
impartiality of all federal judges, the lawyers argued in a hearing
before U.S. Magistrate William Harper.
   Moody's lawyers refused to enter a plea in the arraignment
before Harper rules on their motion. A plea of innocent was
automatically filed.
   Harper referred the case to U.S. District Judge Richard Freeman
for trial. No hearing was scheduled on the motion.
   Defense attorney Bruce Harvey said he believed the motion was
the first of its kind anywhere.
   ``The rationale behind (the request) is clear: no federal judge
can be impartial in a case involving the assassination of a
colleague as a result of the performance of his official duties,''
Harvey said.
   Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Howard Shapiro declined to
comment.
   The court motion did not indicate why the attorneys think two
independent officers should be appointed, and Harvey declined to
explain or give other details.
   Moody, 56, was charged in a 70-count indictment Wednesday with
making and sending a series of mail bombs that killed 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert Vance in Alabama and attorney
Robert Robinson in Georgia.
   Moody faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and a $250,000
fine from a murder charge in the death of Vance. He faces the same
sentence in Robinson's death from a charge for transporting
explosive material with intent to kill.
   Moody also is charged with a variety of other offenses related
to the bombings.
   If convicted on all 70 counts, Moody could face seven life terms
plus 385 years in prison and fines of $16.9 million.
   Moody did not speak at the hearing. He was returned to the
Atlanta Federal Penitentiary, where he is being held on unrelated
witness tampering charges.
   Harvey said courthouses across the country have had extra
security put in place after Vance's killing, and judges and their
families have altered their lifestyles.
   Officials in Alabama and Georgia said they were considering
whether to pursue separate state murder charges - which can carry
the death penalty - against Moody for the bomb slayings.

<HEAD>Figure In Silverado Debacle Claims $196 Million In Debts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Denver developer who defaulted on $106
million in loans from Silverado savings and loan has filed for
personal bankruptcy, claiming $196 million in debts.
   Nathan Jones, an attorney representing ex-developer Bill
Walters, said Thursday that creditors include Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co.; Mellon Bank; Silverado; and Walters' ex-wife, Mary Lou
Walters.
   Jones said creditors probably will get only a fraction of what
they are owed. The case was filed last week in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Santa Ana, Calif.
   ``There are a few assets available, possibly a few hundred
thousand dollars,'' Jones told The Denver Post. ``Bill is a good
guy who has gotten a lot of bad publicity. He was at the end of his
rope.''
   Walters became a prominent figure in the nation's thrift crisis
because of his business relationship with President Bush's son
Neil, a Silverado director.
   Bush voted to approve the $106 million in loans to Walters, who
then defaulted on all the loans.
   Later, it was disclosed that Walters invested $150,000 in Neil
Bush's unsuccessful JNB Exploration oil company and extended him a
$1.75 million line of credit through his Cherry Creek National
Bank.
   During early and mid-1980s, Walters, 45, was one of Denver's
highest-profile developers, listing his net worth at $200 million
during those years. He was chairman of the Greater Denver Chamber
of Commerce in 1987-88.
   Walters developed 3.5 million square feet of office and
residential property in the Denver area and controlled 24 million
square feet of undeveloped land - the size of downtown Denver.
   In addition to Cherry Creek National Bank, he purchased the
South Denver National Bank and the Bank of Westminster.
   But the oil bust took its toll on Walters' real estate and
banking holdings. He sold Cherry Creek National Bank in 1988 and it
failed last month. The other two banks failed in 1987.
   The bankruptcy filing lists Walters' biggest creditors as
Manufacturers Hanover, owed $111 million, and Mellon Bank, owed $23
million. Jones said Walters owes Silverado $18.5 million - the part
of the $106 million that Jones says Walters is personally liable
for - and Mary Lou Walters about $5.35 million.
   Earlier this year, Walters told a congressional panel
investigating Silverado's $1 billion failure that he was broke, but
vowed not to seek bankruptcy protection and to pay back what he
owed Silverado.
   But a few weeks later, Walters was found to be living in a $1.9
million estate in Newport Beach, Calif., listed in the name of his
wife, Jacqueline. The government has filed a $200 million lawsuit
against Bush and other former Silverado directors for their role in
the thrift's failure.

   A U.S. Army soldier was found dead in a shower
in Saudi Arabia, the Pentagon said today.
   A preliminary investigation showed no evidence of foul play, it
said.
   The soldier, whose identity was being withheld until relatives
were notified, was found in the shower on Thursday. The cause of
the death was being investigated.
   The soldier was assigned to the 118th Ordnance Detachment, 11th
Air Defense Artillery Brigade, which deployed to Operation Desert
Shield from Fort Bliss, Texas.
   Because investigatiors have not ruled out that the death could
be from natural causes, it was not added to the total of 43
accidental deaths in Desert Shield since the deployment began Aug.
7, the Pentagon said.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Xanax for Treatment of Panic Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
the first medication for the treatment of panic disorder, a disease
that will affect 3 million Americans at some point in their
lifetimes.
   The medication is Xanax, made by The Upjohn Co. and was approved
in 1981 for the treatment for clinical anxiety and anxiety
associated with depression.
   Panic disorder is characterized by repeated panic attacks in
which a patient is struck by intense fear. Symptoms of panic
attacks can include chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness,
trembling and sweating, nausea and abdominal distress. The symptoms
often mimic a heart attack.
   The company, announcing the FDA action Thursday, estimated that
between 1 percent and 2 percent of the population - an estimated 3
million Americans - will suffer from panic disorder in their
lifetimes.
   For about 60 percent of people with the disorder, it will
disrupt their social and working lives, which can lead to secondary
depression, said officials of the company based in Kalamazoo, Mich.
   A biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is believed to cause
panic attacks, the company said. Xanax, known generically as
alprazolam, can block the attacks by interacting with several
different systems in the brain.
   Upjohn studied alprazolam's role in the treatment of the
disorder in a two-phase study that involved more than 1700 patients
in more than 14 countries, the company said.
   Common side effects included sedation and fatigue, and they
subsided when the dose was reduced or as the medication was
continued, Upjohn said. However, higher doses of Xanax may be
needed for longer periods of time to treat panic disorder, the
company said, and this could lead to greater chance for dependence.
   Upjohn officials said that when the treatment is being
discontinued, ``gradual dosage reduction under a physician's
direction is essential to minimize the potential for adverse
effects.''

   Police barred a well-known Indonesian
poet from publicly reading two of his poems Friday, saying they
posed a threat to racial and religious harmony.
   Jakarta police issued the ban on W.S. Rendra, one of several
Indonesian artists who must obtain a special permit from the
government in order to perform his works.
   Indonesia, the world's most populous Moslem country, prohibits
publishing or publicly performing material that it deems could lead
to racial or religious disturbances.
   The banned poems, entitled ``For the Sake of the People of
Rangkasbitung,'' and ``Prayer of the Youth from Rangkasbitung in
Rotterdam,'' are said to be critical of the Indonesian government.
   Rendra was to have read eight poems at poetry reading sessions
Thursday and Friday. He refused to read the other six works in
protest.
   ``If I read the rest of my poems I would not be doing justice to
my feelings,'' Rendra said.
   Last month, police banned a politically sensitive play,
contending it threatened public order.

   Archeological excavations in
southern Yugoslavia have unearthed gold Roman coins buried some
1,500 years ago, news reports said Friday.
   The 99 coins were found in an underground vault at Gamzigrad,
245 miles south of Belgrade, where they were apparently hidden by
Roman officials in the face of a barbarian onslaught in the 5th
century.
   The value of the coins, discovered last week during restoration
work on a ruined palace, has not yet been appraised, according to
the newspaper Politika.
   Gamzigrad, known as Romuliana in Roman times, was a thriving
trading center that was devastated by advancing Ostrogoths. The
site has been under excavation for the past two decades.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
signed a historic non-aggression treaty with Chancellor Helmut Kohl
today and got a hero's welcome for letting the Berlin Wall and Iron
Curtain collapse.
   Gorbachev's first visit to united Germany came on the first
anniversary of the opening of the Berlin Wall, a fitting
coincidence because his reforms helped bring the Cold War barrier
down.
   Both Kohl and Gorbachev stressed the importance of the
historical changes that have allowed closer ties as they signed the
broad agreement that is to serve as the foundation of future
relations.
   ``Having signed this document one could hardly ... think about
until recently, we have officially ended a whole historical process
and opened a deep perspective for ourselves,'' said Gorbachev.
   In the treaty, initialed in Moscow on Sept. 13, both nations
pledge not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all
European nations.
   A short-lived alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union at
the start of World War II contributed to the deaths of 27 million
Soviet citizens when the allies became foes.
   ``We are closing the book on the painful past and clearing the
way for a new beginning,'' Kohl said in a speech at the signing
cermony.
   Gorbachev arrived at Cologne-Bonn airport this morning in an
Ilyushin-62, and was met by a 27-man German military honor guard.
   He was greeted by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and
gave a hearty wave as he stepped out of the plane.
   Later, Gorbachev was greeted by President Richard von
Weizsaecker at the government's Villa Hammerschmidt palace next to
the Rhine River.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stopped to chat with a crowd of
people waiting for him outside the palace before entering.
   Mrs. Gorbachev later visited the picturesque city of Linz on the
Rhine River with Kohl's wife, Hannelore.
   The 20-year non-aggression treaty that Kohl and Gorbachev signed
aims to assist Gorbachev's financially strapped nation. Details on
the amount of future German aid were expected to dominate their
behind-the-scenes talks.
   Kohl is grateful to Gorbachev for his blessing of German unity,
and has said many times Gorbachev should get help in mastering
problems at home.
   ``We Germans have many reasons to give thanks to Mikhail
Gorbachev,'' Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian
Democrats, said Thursday.
   A festive reception was planned for Gorbachev, his wife Raisa
and for Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Kohl arranged to hold private talks with Gorbachev in Bonn today
and at his home in Oggersheim, 45 miles south of Frankfurt, on
Saturday.
   Gorbachev was to spend tonight at the opulent Petersberg guest
house just outside Bonn, on a mountain overlooking the Rhine River.
A state dinner is scheduled at the government guest house this
evening.
   Kohl has scheduled a visit for Gorbachev to Speyer, home of the
11th-century Speyer Cathedral, resting place for eight German
emperors.
   The two leaders also planned a trip to Deidesheim, a village
known for its wines.
   Shevardnadze and Genscher on Saturday are to fly to Genscher's
hometown, Halle, in former East Germany. After lunch, Genscher
plans to show his guest around the city.
   Serious business will be mixed in with the sightseeing.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the sands of Saudi Arabia,
untested soldiers and combat veterans are playing a different
waiting game. Many of the young are itching for war. The men who've
been there are hoping for peace.
   Marine Lance Cpl. Wayne Lewis, 21, of Reading, Pa., said after
years of watching war movies he wants to experience the real thing
and go home.
   After 30 years in the Marines and two tours in Vietnam, Brig.
Gen. Mike Myatt, commander of the 30,000-member Marine ground force
in northeastern Saudi Arabia, said he hopes his men will leave the
desert without firing a shot.
   It's the classic dichotomy: age and experience versus youth and
impatience.
   As Operation Desert Shield enters its fourth month, the
impatience to attack the Iraqis and liberate Kuwait is increasing,
especially in the lower ranks.
   But those who have survived the carnage of the battlefield seem
more inclined to wait for economic sanctions and diplomatic efforts
to deliver an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   About 230,000 Americans are in the Persian Gulf region, at the
moment only to defend Saudi Arabia, but clearly training for an
offensive operation against Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's troops if
President Bush gives the word.
   Their average age is probably in the low 20s, and youths with
pimples definitely outnumber gray-haired veterans.
   For Lewis, an environmental and safety specialist with Vertical
Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 311, the possibility of death is a
risk ``sort of like being a police officer.
   ``We see all the movies and want to go to war and see what it's
really like,'' he said.
   ``The older Marines ... just want to go home. They've got wives
and families to go to. ... Some of them have already seen it
happen. They don't want to go through it again,'' Lewis said.
   ``I just think the older people want to take their time,'' said
Senior Airman Mike Beam, 22, of Houston, with the 401st Supply
Squadron. ``We just want to go in and clean house and go home.
   ``All of us don't want this to be another Vietnam War. Do it
once - take them out, and just make Iraq a big parking lot.''
   As Myatt ran his officers through a war game responding to a
two-pronged Iraqi attack on eastern Saudi Arabia, he recalled
Vietnam and said ``those who have fought before are hoping this can
be solved by political or diplomatic means.
   ``Nobody who's been in combat ever wants to go back into combat.
But they know that if we have to, we have to be ready,'' said
Myatt, 49.
   That was echoed by Capt. Dean Hendrickson, 46, of Jacksonville,
Fla., a 23-year veteran who now commands Air Wing 17 on the USS
Saratoga, where the crew's average age is between 19 and 20.
   ``Anybody who's been in this stuff before doesn't look forward
to it,'' said Hendrickson, who flew fighters in Vietnam.
   Sgt. Rosie Abraham, 35, of Selma, Ala., with the Army's 326th
Medical Battalion, who missed Vietnam, said she wants to go home
``with all my parts'' and is prepared to wait.
   ``The younger ones is like, hurry up, let's get this over
with,'' she said. ``I don't think they understand what's the
meaning of seeing somebody all shot up, a leg here, an ankle over
there, a hand over here.''
   Army Sgt. Michael Hellon, 24, of Orange County, Calif., with the
525 Military Intelligence Brigade of the 18th Airborne Corps,
dismissed the bravado of the trigger-happy kids as pure hype.
   ``Nobody wants to go to war,'' he said. ``They just talk a bunch
of junk. When the bullets start flying, they'll be the first ones
in the foxholes with their heads down.''
   Certainly not all young servicemen are trigger-happy.
   Senior Airman Dan Abert, 21, of Syracuse, N.Y., with the 1st Air
Medical Evacuation Squadron, had some advice for the president.
   ``Wait it out to the max,'' he said. ``Bush is getting pretty
tense and I think Saddam wants to see that. Maybe he should go to
Maine for a little while longer, come back, and sit it out.''

<HEAD>Officials Say Universal Studios Tour Will Take Months to Rebuild</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``King Kong'' will roar at
tourists again soon, but the Universal Studios Tour won't fully
recover for months from an arson fire, officials said.
   The sheriff's department Friday said the damage was estimated at
$25 million. Tuesday's fire damaged 20 percent of the studio's
420-acre backlot.
   Dan Slusser, vice president and general manager of Universal
City Studios, said Thursday it would take six months to rebuild the
backlot.
   The ``King Kong'' attraction will re-open in a few days,
spokeswoman Joan Bullard said.
   Michael J. Huston, a 40-year-old security guard booked for
investigation of arson, was being held Friday in lieu of $1 million
bail.
   Lt. Ken Chausse, chief of the sheriff's department arson unit,
said investigators were still sifting through the lot for physical
evidence.
   ``We have strong admissions from (Huston), but you can have
anybody come up and tell you they did something,'' Chausse said.
``You have to corroborate it, or it doesn't mean anything.''
   Huston's mother, Debra Dragusica, said he told her Thursday that
he was responsible.
   ``He says his mind switched off,'' she said. ``He says it wasn't
him when he did it. ... When he realized what he did, he ran to get
help.''
   Robert Dragusica, who said he is Huston's half brother, said
Huston was innocent. But he did say Huston had been mentally
disabled since serving in Vietnam in 1969.
   The backlot was used to film such productions as ``Lady Sings
the Blues,'' ``Dirty Harry,'' the ``Back to the Future'' films,
Michael Jackson's ``Moonwalker'' and ``Streets of Fire.''
   About a dozen movies and television shows are now looking for
replacement filming locations, Slusser said.
   Stock analysts said a proposed $9 billion merger between MCA
Inc., Universal's parent company, and Matsushita Industrial
Electric Co. would not be influenced by the fire. MCA said the fire
losses, estimated at about $20 million, are covered by insurance.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Legislation Extending Trade Benefits to Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today signed legislation to
extend most-favored-nation trade benefits to Czechoslovakia.
   He called the measure ``an important milestone not only in
U.S.-Czechoslovak relations, but also in Czechoslovakia's
re-integration into the global economy and the community of free
nations.''
   Under the agreement, the United States and Czechoslovakia will
grant each the lowest possible tariffs on their goods.
   The Bush administration earlier awarded the preferentialtrade
status to Poland and Hungary in the aftermath of the upheaval in
Eastern Europe.
   Bush said he was ``particularly pleased'' to sign the measure at
this time because he will be in Prague, Czechoslovakia, later this
month as part of an eight-day trip to Europe and the Persian Gulf.
   He praised the Warsaw-pact nation for ``tremendous strides''
toward economic reform and trade liberalization.
   Most-favored-nation status is denied to countries that do not
have open markets or which have restrictive emigration policies.
   Toddy's action will result in sharply lower tariffs for
Czechoslovakia's exports to the United States and vice versa.
Before the new benefits can take effect, Czechoslovakia's Federal
Assembly must give the arrangement final approval.
   Bush said the move ``will provide the impetus for greatly
expanded trade between the United States and Czechoslovakia and the
first step toward a normalization of our bilateral trade
relations.''
   The United States has also offered to grant the Soviet Union
such status, but it is being delayed until the Soviet Union enacts
a more-liberalized policy on emigration by Soviets Jews and other
minorities.

<TEXT>
   India's new prime minister, Chandra
Shekhar, is the aging angry young man of Indian politics.
   Left-leaning since his university days, the 63-year-old
politician tapped for the job Friday has long advocated social and
economic justice for India's masses. Most of India's top political
leaders have.
   Few have had much luck changing things in a country of 880
million people where fewer than half can read and write and the
average annual income is barely $300
   But Chandra Shekhar, who seems to be perpetually scowling
through his salt-and-pepper beard, knows a little more about such
things than most of his fellow players at the top ranks of the
national political game.
   He was born in the village of Ibrahimpatti near the borders of
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar state 460 miles southeast of New Delhi.
   The region is geographically remote but politically in the
center of northern India's Hindu heartland. It has produced all of
the country's prime ministers.
   Years ago, Chandra Shekhar told an interviewer he was the first
educated man from his village of 1,000 people. ``My mother is
illiterate. My father too is hardly literate,'' he said.
   But like all of India's prime ministers, he came from an upper
caste in the complex Hindu social system, which automatically
confers pride and privilege if not wealth.
   Chandra Shekhar rejected this. Hedropped his family's surname
of Singh, which made him instantly recognizable as a member of the
``Thakur'' or ``landlord'' caste. He now goes only by his first
name, Chandra Shekhar, which is written as two words.
   He studied political science at Allahabad University in Uttar
Pradesh state and joined obscure socialist groups.
   In 1967 he switched to the Congress Party that produced India's
first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and the prime ministerial
dynasty of Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, and her son, Rajiv
Gandhi.
   Chandra Shekhar was briefly a stalwart of Mrs. Gandhi,
supporting her decision to nationalize banks and abolish the
maharajahs' privy purses. But he broke with her as she moved deeper
into authoritarian rule, culminating in the state of emergency from
1975 to 1977 when she suspended civil rights and elections.
   He was one of thousands of political leaders jailed by Mrs.
Gandhi during the emergency. Much of his 21 months in prison was
spent in solitary confinement.
   When Mrs. Gandhi lifted the emergency and over-confidently
called elections in 1977, Chandra Shekhar was among the founders of
the Janata Party that defeated her. But the prime minister's job
went to someone else. Chandra Shekhar became the party's president.
   Less than two years later, the Janata government fell part in
internal bickering.
   History looks like it's ready to repeat itself - except this
time the party broke apart before the government did.
   Chandra Shekhar remained president of the Janata Party until
1988 when it disbanded to become a major component of the Janata
Dal party, a collection of politicians drawn together by little
more than their dislike of Rajiv Gandhi.
   He joined the Janata Dal led by Singh, the prime minister whose
11-month-old government was ousted in a Parliament vote Wednesday.
   Only two days before the vote, Chandra Shekhar led a breakaway
faction of the Janata Dal party in opposing Singh.
   Chandra Shekhar calls his splinter group the Janata Dal
(Socialist), which counts between 50 and 60 members in the 522-seat
policy-making lower house of Parliament. For the moment at least,
he has the support of his long-time foe, Rajiv Gandhi, and Gandhi's
195-member Congress Party.
   How long Chandra Shekhar can keep the prime minister's job is
questionable. Gandhi, after a year as opposition leader, is waiting
in the wings for yet another non-Congress Party government to
disintegrate. If the Congress Party withdraws support, it is
unlikely Chandra Shekhar could find sufficient support elsewhere to
survive.
   Until the current political maneuvering, Chandra Shekhar was
best-known in India for the 2,500-mile walk he did over six months
in 1983.
   He traveled from India's southernmost tip to New Delhi, saying
he wanted to see first-hand and dramatize the plight of the
country's downtrodden. It was a tactic borrowed from India's
beloved independence leader and apostle of nonviolence, Mohandas K.
Gandhi, the ``Mahatma,'' or ``Great Soul.''
   But Chandra Shekhar's ``padayatra,'' or ``foot travel,''
produced little more than publicity for him.

   A gas explosion in a coal mine in southern China
has killed at least eight miners and injured 10, an official report
said.
   The explosion Wednesday afternoon was the second in five months
at the Furen Coal Mine in Guangdong province, the local Yangcheng
Daily reported Thursday. The paper was seen in Beijing on Friday.
   The mine was operated by a private contractor who did not pay
attention to safety precautions and did not provide equipment to
measure gas levels, the paper said. A similar gas explosion in June
killed three miners, it said.
   Yangcheng Daily reporters, contacted by phone, said Friday they
had no new information about the blast or a new death toll. Calls
to the Shaoguan county government, where the mine is located, were
not answered.
   Most Chinese mines lack modern equipment and safety provisions.
Official figures indicate that about 1,780 miners were killed last
year, the lowest annual death toll in 40 years.

   Too busy to get sick, and too busy to get

   A hospital is offering free drive-through flu shots for Southern
California's automobile-obsessed residents.
   ``Roll up your sleeve and put your arm out the car window as you
queue up for Los Angeles County's first drive-through flu clinic on
Saturday Nov. 10 at Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center,'' the
hospital declared in a news release.
   Volunteer nurses will spend the morning injecting motorists with
a vaccine effective against three strains of influenza that health
officials believe may reach the United States this winter:
A-Shanghai-89, A-Taiwan-86 and B-Yamagata.
   The hospital opted to provide the drive-in shots because
construction at the hospital has reduced the number of parking

   But the hospital hasn't gone completely automobile crazy.
   ``Walk-ins also will be accepted,'' it said.

   President Bush signed legislation today
requiring food manufacturers to put more nutrition information on
package labels.
   THe bill, designed to help consumers choose a more healthful
diet, sets specific standards for what information must be on food
labels.
   It also prohibits manufacturers from making health claims on
their packaging unless scientifically proven according to the Food
and Drug Administration.
   The legislation also requires that bulk food in bins, raw fish
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure
providing nutritional information.
   Food sold by restaurants, cafeterias, hospitals and grocers with
annual sales of less than $500,000 is exempt.
   Labels would be required to display:
   -Serving size.
   -Number of servings per container.
   -Calories per serving and number of calories from fat.
   -Amount of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total
carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber,
protein.
   It forbids disease-prevention claims unless the FDA has found
the contention supported by science.
   The measure requires the Department of Health and Human Services
to publish draft regulations 12 months after enactment, and final
regulations six months later.

<HEAD>Afrikaner Church Rejects Apartheid, Confesses Role in Segregation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associatead Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RUSTENBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The white Dutch Reformed Church
joined other Christian denominations Friday in rejecting apartheid
as a sin and confessed the church's role in implementing it.
   The main church of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate
the government had argued for decades that the Bible supported the
system of legalized segregation. The position isolated it from
other denominations.
   But at the end of a weeklong conference of 90 Christian
churches, leaders of the white Dutch Reformed Church joined in
supporting a statement - the Rustenberg Declaration - condemning
church participation in apartheid.
   ``We confess our own sin and acknowledge our heretical part in
the policy of apartheid which has led to such extreme suffering,''
the joint statement said.
   ``We denounce apartheid in its intention, its implementation,
and its consequences as an evil policy,'' the statement added.
   The conference in Rustenburg, 60 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, was the largest ever gathering of Christian churches
in South Africa.
   The declaration also recommended the government remove all
apartheid laws, set up a one-person, one-vote democracy, seek
equitable wealth distribution, restore land to blacks and arrange
an affirmative action program to advance blacks.
   The Rev. Peter Potgieter, head of the Dutch Reformed Church,
told an impromptu news conference during final debate on the
document that his church disagreed with some elements. He said it
objected specifically to the call for a one-person, one-vote
electoral system and other political recommendations, but agreed
with the condemnation and confession of apartheid.
   Potgieter also said the document was not official church policy,
which must be decided by the church's synod.
   For years, the white Dutch Reformed Church has been isolated
from most other Christian churches because of its refusal to reject
the apartheid system of racial segregation and white dominance.
   It argued for decades that the Bible supported apartheid, citing
biblical passages that referred to different people in different
nations. The church also considered whites, and Afrikaners in
particular, a ``chosen people'' destined to rule South Africa as
part of ``God's will.''
   In a major policy statement in 1960, the church said segregation
could be justified. Twenty-six years later, it declared racial
discrimination a sin, but withheld comment on apartheid.
   The mere presence of white Dutch Reformed Church leaders at the
conference marked a breakthrough in interchurch relations,
organizers said.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, leader of the South African Council of
Churches, praised the document but said he understood the Dutch
Reformed Church's hesitation to give it full support.
   ``I feel that we have started a process, and I'm just hoping the
Dutch Reformed Church will be able to move ahead with us,'' he
said. ``I understand they're constrained, they have to answer back
to their own membership,'' Chikane added.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said he hoped the white
church's objections avoided critical sections of the declaration.
   ``Obviously, what we hear is political,'' Tutu said. ``It is
going to be up to them to demonstrate through action what they have
said in words.''
   The Rustenburg Declaration said all South African churches
should have done more to resist apartheid.
   ``Some of us actively misused the Bible to justify apartheid,
leading many to believe that it had the sanction of God,'' it said.
   Other churches, the document said, ignored apartheid by
preaching the ``sufficiency of individual salvation without social
transformation.''
   ``We adopted an allegedly neutral stance which in fact resulted
in complicity with apartheid,'' it said.
   Some churches condemned apartheid but did little to resist, the
statement added.
   ``Those of us who were the victims of apartheid acknowledge our
own contribution to the failure of the church,'' it said.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church has about 1
million members, including President F.W. de Klerk and most of his
Cabinet. There are separate branches for blacks and people of
mixed-race, which have staunchly opposed apartheid.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church said last month it
wants to merge with its sister churches, but no action has been
taken.

   American military forces in the Persian Gulf
will reach up to 430,000 within weeks, nearly doubling existing
U.S. firepower in the region and matching Iraq's troop strength in
Kuwait.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today half of all American
land forces in Europe would be moved to the Persian Gulf. About
200,000 Army troops are stationed in Europe, most in Germany.
   Those 100,000 European-based troops would join 230,000 U.S.
troops already deployed to the gulf and another 100,000 being sent
abroad from U.S. bases. President Bush signed deployment orders for
the dramatic new escalation on Thursday.
   The scale of the additional U.S. troop deployments is enormous.
Once the added forces are in place, America will have more troops
in the gulf region than it had in Europe during the Cold War when
the perceived enemy was a nuclear superpower. About one-third of
the Army's worldwide force will be in the Saudi desert.
   Bush also ordered the Navy to dispatch three aircraft carrier
battle groups to the gulf area, in addition to the three already
there. Today, the Navy announced it was sending the USS Theodore
Roosevelt and the USS America, both based at Norfolk, Va., and the
USS Ranger, from San Diego, Calif. Each of the carriers includes
about 80 aircraft and about 5,500 sailors.
   The Navy said it would announce later which escort ships would
accompany the carriers.
   Cheney's remarks today to the Conservative Leadership Conference
indicated that President Bush intends to have about 430,000 U.S.
forces in the gulf area within weeks - equaling the current level
of Iraqi troops in and around Kuwait.
   ``The additional increment will give us the capacity to
undertake offensive action should that become necessary,'' Cheney
said.
   He suggested in comments to reporters later that Bush's new
order means the approximately 230,000 U.S. forces already there
will not be rotating back to the United States early next year as
Cheney had tentatively planned.
   Asked whether the full contingent of American forces in the gulf
would be there for the duration of the crisis, Cheney said,
``That's correct.''
   Bush said Thursday in announcing new deployments for Operation
Desert Shield that he still hoped to get Iraq out of Kuwait without
starting a war. But he said he wanted an ``adequate offensive
military option'' in case United Nations economic sanctions and
diplomatic pressures against Iraq prove futile.
   Analysts said the move brought the United States closer to war
with Iraq.
   ``The Iraqis, in effect, are being put on notice that they will
be attacked'' unless they withdraw from Kuwait under Bush's terms,
said Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security Policy
and a former Pentagon official.
   About 230,000 U.S. air, ground and sea forces now are in and
around Saudi Arabia, and a coalition of other Western and Arab
nations has put at least 100,000 troops in the gulf area. The Iraqi
force in Kuwait and southern Iraq is estimated at 430,000.
   Bush and Pentagon officials refused to disclose specific numbers
of weapons and soldiers in the gulf region. But additional Army
forces being brought in from Germany will more than double the
number of U.S. tanks in Saudi Arabia, to about 2,000, judging from
organization charts and estimates by Army sources.
   The Pentagon estimates that Iraq has about 3,500 tanks in and
around Kuwait.
   Bush said he hoped Iraqi President Saddam Hussein viewed the
stepped-up U.S. deployments to the gulf as evidence that the
Western and Arab coalition arrayed against him was serious about
using military force if diplomatic and economic pressures fail.
   ``If this movement of force is what convinces him, so much the
better,'' Bush said. He added later, ``When he surveys the force
that's there ... he will recognize that he is up against just a foe
that he can't possibly manage militarily.''
   ``I am concerned that the administration is moving to establish
an offensive capacity in advance of a U.N. resolution authorizing
offensive action,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He said the international
trade embargo against Iraq has not had ``a decent chance to produce
results.''
   The Marines are sending the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from
Camp LeJeune, N.C., which includes roughly 45,000 men and is about
equal to the Marine unit now in the gulf. In addition, the Marines
are deploying the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade from Camp
Pendleton, Calif., with at least 5,000 men, and the four-ship 1st
Maritime Prepositioning Ship Squadron from Norfolk, Va.
   That doubles the size of the Marine commitment to Desert Shield
and taps virtually all the Marine combat power available in the
United States, according to senior Marine Corps officials.
   The Marines also will have a few thousand men aboard a group of
Navy ships that form a specially tailored amphibious assault unit
to be deployed from San Diego, Calif. One such amphibious unit
already is afloat in the gulf. Together they could be used to
launch an assault on Kuwait City, where Western hostages are being
held.
   Bush ordered the Navy to send three aircraft carrier battle
groups to the gulf area to join the three - the USS Saratoga, the
USS Midway and the USS John F. Kennedy - that already are there. He
did not say which carriers would be added.
   The Navy also is sending the USS Missouri, a World War II-era
battleship equipped with 16-inch guns, Tomahawk cruise missiles and
nearly 2,000 crew members. One battleship, the USS Wisconsin, has
been in the gulf since late summer.
   The Army is transferring the equivalent of about 2{ armored
divisions from Germany, plus command units, and the famous ``Big
Red One'' 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Riley, Kan.
   For the first time in the crisis, the Pentagon also ordered
combat units of the Army National Guard to active duty.

   Mary Robinson, a lawyer who had fought to
legalize divorce and contraception, was elected president of
Ireland today.
   Mrs. Robinson, the first woman elected to the office, overtook
former deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Brian Lenihan on
the second round of counting, election officials said.
   She finished with 52.8 percent of the vote, said Tim Sexton, who
supervised the count.
   In an interview minutes before the announcement, Mrs. Robinson
noted that it was the anniversary of the opening of the Berlin
Wall.
   ``And I think something has crumbled away in this election - the
old preconceptions, the old political ways,'' said Mrs. Robinson,
who in the past had battled church and state in campaigns to
liberalize Irish society.
   ``I think the joy and the hope and the sense of moving forward
in this election is quite tangible,'' she said.
   She will be inaugurated Dec. 3, succeeding Patrick Hillery, who
must retire after two seven-year terms in the largely ceremonial
post.
   Mrs. Robinson received 84.8 percent of the second-preference
votes from supporters of Austin Currie, the Fine Gael party nominee
who ran third.
   In the first round of counting, Lenihan of the Fianna Fail party
had 44.1 percent of the vote to 38.9 percent for Mrs. Robinson and
Currie's 17 percent.
   Since no one got a majority in the first round, the result
turned on the second choices marked by Currie's supporters.
   Mrs. Robinson was nominated by the leftist Labor Party and the
Workers Party, but she belongs to neither. The two parties pulled a
combined 14.7 percent of the vote in last year's parliamentary
election. She is the first president since 1945 not a member of the
majority Fianna Fail party.
   It was Ireland's first contested presidential election in 17
years.
   Mrs. Robinson, 46, served 20 years in the Irish Senate but found
more success in the courts in pressing her causes of equality for
women and minorities. As an advocate of legalized divorce and
contraception, she was often at odds with much of the country and
her own Roman Catholic Church.
   Earlier today, Mrs. Robinson said she had been elated when it
became clear that she was in position to win.
   ``I had this extraordinary sensation of just how important it
was, particularly for women,'' she told reporters at her Dublin
home.
   ``I quite literally wanted to go out and dance in the street. I
almost had to be restrained. I know the joy that is there in so
many people's hearts. They have told me how much this election
means to them and I know why.''
   Anticipating her victory, The Irish Times said in an editorial
today the election ``marks the point at which a narrow and often
cruel road, journeyed by a society often narrow and cruel, gives
the first sign of broadening out.''
   The Irish Press said the election ``signals a change in Irish
society and a shift away from traditional attitudes and
allegiances.''
   Mrs. Robinson is a lecturer on European Community law at Trinity
College, her alma mater. She also holds a master's degree from
Harvard.
   Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, which have dominated Ireland since it
gained independence from Britain in 1922, are both conservative on
social and economic issues.
   Lenihan, 59, was perhaps the most popular man in Fianna Fail and
had been expected to win the election easily. But Prime Minister
Charles Haughey was forced to dismiss Lenihan as deputy prime
minister and defense minister last week to save his coalition
government from collapse.
   Lenihan was accused of lying about his role in a 1982 effort by
Fianna Fail leaders seeking to avoid a national election following
a no-confidence vote against the government of former Prime
Minister Garret FitzGerald
   Currie, 51, was a leader in the Catholic civil rights campaign
in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and a founder of the Social
Democratic and Labor Party, the main Catholic party in Northern
Ireland. He was elected last year to the Dail, the lower house of
Ireland's Parliament.

   Nervous parents throughout central
Connecticut stood lookout at school bus stops following the
kidnapping at gunpoint of an 8-year-old girl.
   The youngster was released unharmed, but the kidnapper remained
at large Friday. Police said they were making progress, but
declined to elaborate.
   A man described as in his mid-30s drove up to a school bus stop
Wednesday morning where three girls were standing. He displayed a
gun, and ordered them into his car, police said. He grabbed an
8-year-old, but the girl's 5-year-old sister and their friend, 10,
managed to flee.
   The kidnap victim was released about an hour later more than 10
miles away in Guilford.Police said none of the girls knew the
gunman.
   Roadblocks were set up Wednesday and Thursday morning on the
roads where the kidnapping occurred and where the girl was
released.
   Wallingford police Sgt. Joseph Curran said the roadblocks
``turned up information,'' but he would not release any details.
   In Wallingford and the neighboring town of North Branford,
parents were urged to have adults stand lookout at school bus
stops, school officials said.
   In Cheshire, a worried mother called police Thursday afternoon
to report her son was late coming home from elementary school and
that a crossing guard had reported seeing him get into a car.
Police said it turned out that the child had taken a ride from a
friend's mother.
   All three girls returned to their elementary school Thursday,
where they ``seemed to be adjusting surprisingly well,'' said
Schools Superintendent Joseph Cirasuolo.
   Cirasuolo said some parents drove their children to school
rather than having them take the bus, but that bus usage was down
only slightly.

   Leaders of the President's Drug Advisory
Council said Friday that President Bush should speak on television
twice a year to reinforce his commitment to the war on drugs.
   They also urged the country's 500 richest businesses to pay for
anti-drug booklets for each of the nation's 32 million grade-school
children and said all professional sports team uniforms should
carry anti-drug patches.
   ``There needs to be a national image, a national symbol, a
national logo that everyone can look at like the American flag,''
said Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates, founder of California's Drug
Use is Life Abuse program.
   The council's National Leadership Forum heard from the heads of
three substance abuse programs in California, Florida and
Washington singled out as national models.
   ``This is not a war on drugs. This is really a rebuilding effort
- rebuilding our communities so we have safe places to live and
work and go to school,'' said Paul Dziedzic, special assistant to
Washington Gov. Booth Gardner.
   Edward ``Thad'' Foote, president of the University of Miami and
chairman of The Miami Coalition, said his group has determined that
some old assumptions about drug abuse were wrong.
   ``We were perilously close to just throwing up our hands a few
years ago,'' Foote said. ``We found out this problem wasn't going
to go away by building more jails or sending more ships to the
Caribbean.''
   Dade County has demolished 700 crack cocaine houses in Miami
over two years and boasts a ``virtually unheard of'' 4 percent
recidivism rate in an alternative ``drug court'' that expunges
criminal records of drug abusers who complete treatment-education
programs within a year, Foote said.
   ``And we finally figured out if you want to break the cycle of
addiction for poor sick people, you've got to find them a job,'' he
said.
   Gates said Orange County has beefed up law enforcement but also
made a priority of changing attitudes about drugs through a
marketing approach modeled after anti-smoking campaigns.
   The California program has made popular a logo, ``Drug Use is
Life Abuse.'' It also enlisted the help of Walt Disney Co. to
develop a booklet with three animated animal characters, ``Skippy,
Spike and Wise Owl Mike,'' who preach against substance abuse
through a rap song.
   The booklets could be published for 10 cents each if the
nation's top 500 companies would donate a total of $3.2 million for
mass production of 32 million copies, he said.
   Gates said the Los Angeles Rams sported an anti-drug emblem on
their uniform in 1989, but the idea has been opposed by the NFL and
other sports leagues. ``We need a logo on the uniform of every
professional sports team, football, baseball, basketball and
soccer,'' he said.

   A battle between rival black
factions broke out in a Natal township following an attack on a
workers' hostel, and police said Friday that 16 people had died.
   The violence in Bruntville on Thursday sent women fleeing with
their children to a nearby town. Police said all the victims were
men who had stab wounds.
   In another incident Thursday, assailants attacked a bus carrying
workers in the Johannesburg township of Sebokeng. Police said one
man was killed and 12 were injured.
   Authorities did not identify the combatants in either case, but
most township fighting has been between supporters of the African
National Congress and the rival Inkatha Freedom Party, the
country's largest black political movements.
   The Bruntville fighting apparently was sparked Wednesday when a
meeting hall was damaged before residents of a workers' hostel were
to have met there. On Thursday, attackers with guns, knives and
gasoline bombs attacked one of the township hostels, killing one
man and injuring dozens.
   The hostels, which house migrant workers, have been frequent
targets of attack in the township violence.
   Women took their children and fled for the nearby town of Mooi
River, apparently anticipating more violence.
   Police said that later that night, a battle broke out between
two groups of men in Bruntville. Officers dispersed them and found
15 bodies. The township is in the eastern province of Natal, 80
miles northwest of Durban.
   About 5,000 blacks have died in factional fighting in Natal
Province since 1986. In August, the fighting spread to Johannesburg
townships, where about 800 blacks have been killed.
   A court on Friday refused bail to five men arrested in massacres
related to the unrest. The five are alleged to have been involved
in the slaying of 21 people killed in two train attacks in
September near Johannesburg. Each faces 21 charges of murder and 49
of attempted murder.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev today praised the
nations opposing Iraq's aggression in the Persian Gulf and said
Saddam Hussein's attempts to divide the multinational effort are
bound to fail.
   However, Gorbachev was evasive when he was asked whether he
would support the use of force to drive Iraqi troops from Kuwait,
or whether Soviet soldiers might take part in such a miliary
action.
   Earlier this week, Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard
Shevardnadze, gave qualified support for a proposed U.N. resolution
authorizing the use of force by the armies, navies and air forces
of many nations arrayed against Iraq.
   The Soviet president told reporters today that the U.N. efforts
to isolate Iraq have been a ``victory'' for the nations
participating.
   ``Everything we have done up to now ... has been a great
victory,'' said Gorbachev, pointing out the scope of the
international effort to isolate Iraq.
   ``For the first time in history we have acted together in so
critical a situation,'' he said. ``Let no one reckon on driving a
wedge into that unity.''
   Gorbachev's remarks, which are similar to comments on the gulf
crisis that he and other Soviet officials have made earlier, came
during a news conference on the first day of a two-day official
visit to Germany.
   As proof of the international ``victory,'' Gorbachev noted that
oil is still being pumped in the Middle East and ``the world
economy is functioning.''
   Gorbachev said it will be up to the United Nations to decide
what steps to take next against in the gulf crisis.
   ``The United Nations should now decide how to proceed further,''
said Gorbachev, adding: ``We should act firmly, and consistently.''
   ``We have condemned the aggressor. All attempts to shake unity
will continue to be doomed,'' he added.
   Saddam has repeatedly tried to divide the anti-Iraq forces by
releasing some countries' hostages while holding onto others.
   He has also tried to divide the West from its Arab allies by
saying that negotiations over his invasion of Kuwait should be tied
to a solution of the dispute over Israel's occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Gorbachev said that the gulf crisis is presenting the world with
a ``test of the new politics'' of international cooperation that
have evolved with the end of the Cold War. He said the crisis has
set off a search for ``a new approach that is politically
appropriate'' for dealing with the problem.

   Minnesota Vikings placekicker Donald
Igwebuike was indicted today by a federal grand jury on charges he
schemed to smuggle heroin from his native Nigeria.
   Igwebuike was charged with conspiracy to import, conspiracy to
possess with intent to distribute and the importation of heroin.
   He was at Vikings' headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minn., this
morning and was to turn himself in to federal authorities in
Minneapolis later in the day, said Minnesota U.S. Attorney Jerry
Arnold.
   Igwebuike's name was linked to the case two weeks ago when ABC
News reported that prosecutors in Tampa had ``irrefutable''
evidence connecting the placekicker to an attempt to smuggle heroin
into the United States from Nigeria.
   Igwebuike was charged on three counts of a four-count indictment
that also named Maduwuba Ibekwe and Ibezim Ofedu, who had already
been arrested and charged in the case.
   Ibekwe, a taxi driver and substitute teacher in Hillsborough
County, was arrested Oct. 12 at Orlando International Airport where
a a U.S. Customs Service inspector discovered three pellets
containing heroin.
   Ibekwe, who allegedly swallowed 31 packets of heroin before
boarding his flight to Orlando, was released from a hospital three
days later after he passed more packets.
   Ibekwe, earlier charged with importation of heroin, pleaded
innocent and is being held without bond at the Hillsborough County
Jail. Ofedu also was denied bond after court records said he
accepted about 400 grams of heroin from an undercover customs
agents.
   Attorney Larry Reed said Igwebuike did not help Ibekwe import
heroin but simply wanted Ibekwe to rush $12,000 to his parents in
Nigeria. Reed said the kicker's parents received the money.
   Custom agents searched Igwebuike's Bloomington, Minn., apartment
the day after the ABC report and reportedly seized telephone
records and other personal papers.
   Igwebuike has been one of the most accurate and consistent
placekickers in the NFL during his career. Before going to
Minnesota this year, he spent five years with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers and is the club's all-time leading scorer with 416
points.

   Members of Congress say President Bush's
massive deployment of nearly 200,000 additional U.S. forces to the
Persian Gulf is a signal to the nation to get ready for war.
   ``I think the American people need to prepare themselves for a
major conflict in the Middle East,'' said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,
a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
   There was cautious support for the latest military buildup, but
Rep. Charles Rangel was harshly critical of Bush's action.
   ``With this troop buildup, the president is sending every signal
that instead of seeking peaceful solutions, he plans to rush the
nation into war,'' Rangel said Friday.
   Rangel, D-N.Y., suggested that while many U.S. allies have
placed a stronger emphasis on a diplomatic solution to the more
than three-month stalemate, ``the president really seems to be
going his own way on this.''
   Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, said he wouldn't second guess Bush.
   The president, Symms said, ``has sole responsibility for
assuring we have adequate military might.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said that although Bush has broad
support from the American people, the backing is ``very thin.''
   ``There's a great deal of uneasiness about all of this,'' he
said. ``They do not want American casualties. They feel that very,
very strongly.''
   Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Middle East
subcommittee, said Bush ``needs to be more precise and more
articulate than he has been about the reasons for our deployment
there and precisely what our commitment has been.''
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. A week later, Bush sent thousands
of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia and the gulf area to stop further
Iraqi aggression.
   On Thursday, Bush announced the deployment of additional forces
to provide the United States with the offensive power necessary if
there is a conflict with the 430,000 Iraqis in and around Kuwait.
   The list of units involved indicates as many as 200,000 more
Americans will be sent.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney indicated Friday that the
approximately 230,000 U.S. forces already in the area won't be
rotated back to the United States early next year as the Pentagon
had planned.
   Democratic Rep. Jim Slattery of Kansas said he hoped the
increase in U.S. troops would lead to a peaceful solution.
   ``Hopefully, deployment ... will convince Saddam Hussein to
retreat from Kuwait,'' Slattery said.
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, expressed concern that the United States was
moving to create an offensive capability ``in advance of a U.N.
resolution authorizing offensive action.''
   ``The United States should not be the unilateral policeman of
the world,'' Pell said.
   Slattery, Pell and Skelton made their comments Thursday night.

   Advisers to Gov. L. Douglas Wilder have
formed a committee that could be converted to a presidential
campaign organization if the nation's first elected black governor
decides to run in 1992.
   ``That's absolutely true,'' Paul Goldman, chairman of the
Democratic Party of Virginia, said Friday of the Committee for
Fiscal Responsibility in 1992. ``Yes, we will be fund raising, but
that's not the primary purpose.''
   Papers to create the committee were filed Thursday with the
Federal Election Commission in Washington, D.C. Goldman is
executive director of the committee, and Mark Warner of Alexandria,
a key fund-raising adviser to the governor, is its treasurer.
   Goldman said the committee is designed to promote a message of
fiscal responsibility ``as part of the theme the Democratic Party
should present to the country in 1992.''
   He said the committee could make contributions to candidates who
share the goal of fiscal responsibility. It also would help send
committee members who favor spending cuts over new taxes to
meetings across the country.
   The committee is not a campaign organization for Wilder to seek
the 1992 Democratic nomination for president, but could be made
into one, Goldman said.
   Wilder declined to comment on the committee. His spokeswoman,
Laura Dillard, said, ``That committee is something that's Mr.
Goldman's.''
   Wilder, the first elected black governor in U.S. history, has
said he plans to serve out his term, which ends in January 1994.
   But he increasingly has thrust himself into the national
spotlight by stumping for Democratic candidates and by promoting
his opposition to new taxes.
   As governor, Wilder has ordered substantial spending cuts to
meet a projected $1.4 billion shortfall in the state budget.

   The Soviet Union has given its qualified consent to the use of
force, and President Bush has ordered more than 150,000 additional
troops to the Persian Gulf, giving the multinational forces an
offensive military option.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III flew from Moscow to London
today on his mission to strengthen allied resolve against Iraq's
3-month-old occupation of Kuwait. Baker will meet Saturday with
French leaders in Paris.
   In Moscow, a senior U.S. official said today that Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and other Arab forces would fight alongside U.S. troops to
free Kuwait. But the official said the extent of France's support
was not known.
   In another boost for the anti-Iraqi forces, Mikhail S. Gorbachev
today said Saddam Hussein's attempts to divide the multinational
effort are bound to fail. Speaking in Germany, where he is on an
official visit, Gorbachev said: ``Everything we have done up to now
... has been a great victory.''
   ``For the first time in history we have acted together in so
critical a situation. Let no one reckon on driving a wedge into
that unity.''
   Iraq's government-run newspaper said today that Iraq and France
conducted secret talks that led to the release of more than 300
Frenchmen from Iraq.
   The paper, Al-Jumhouriya, said the talks between Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz and former French Foreign Minister Claude
Cheysson were endorsed by the French government. France has denied
any deals were struck for hostages.
   Western officials have criticized efforts by former leaders -
including Edward Heath of Britain, Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, and
Willy Brandt of Germany - to free hostages, claiming they help
divide the anti-Iraq alliance.
   Brandt left Baghdad for Frankfurt today with 177 Westerners,
mostly Germans. But those on the flight included three Americans
and 14 Britons - seven more Britons than originally indicated. Two
Americans were held back when Iraqi officials told the U.S. Embassy
their papers were not in order.
   In a more personal attempt to influence Saddam, 11 British women
headed to Baghdad today to seek the release of their captive
husbands and relatives - against the advice of their government.
   At the United Nations today, Iraq's attempt to introduce a
General Assembly resolution criticizing the U.S. military buildup
in the Perisan Gulf drew a stinging rebuke when an assembly
committee unanimously refused to consider it.
   The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering,
called the Iraqi motion, ``ill-founded, tendentious and
mendacious,''
   President Bush on Thursday ordered the new troops to the gulf,
saying he wanted an ``adequate offensive military option'' should
global sanctions fail to persuade Saddam to withdraw from Kuwait.
   But despite the talk of offensive capability, Bush said he still
hoped Saddam would ``come to his senses'' and avoid combat by
pulling out. Bush did not give numbers, but Pentagon officials said
in private conversations that full deployment of the units involved
would involve about 150,000 troops.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in Washington today the new
troop deployments would include one-half of American land forces in
Germany. He said Bush intends to have about 430,000 U.S. forces in
the gulf area within weeks.
   ``The additional increment will give us the capacity to
undertake offensive action should that become necessary,'' Cheney
said today.
   There are now 230,000 U.S. military personnel in the region.
Allies from 26 countries have sent 100,000 soldiers to the
multinational force assembled in the area. About 200,000 Army
troops are stationed in Europe, most in Germany.
   Iraq's ambassador to Washington, Mohamed Al-Mashat, called the
new U.S. deployment plan ``an unfortunate development.''
   ``There is no reason for this force, or the previous force,'' he
said Thursday on CBS' America Tonight. ``We haven't done anything
to the United States.''
   ``Believe you me, we will never surrender or capitulate,'' he
said.
   Iraq has deployed an estimated 430,000 soldiers in Kuwait and
southern Iraq since invading its southern oil-rich neighbor Aug. 2
in a dispute over land, oil and money.
   The invasion increased Iraq's share of world oil reserves to 20
percent and sent crude prices skyrocketing.
   In Moscow, meanwhile, Baker accomplished his goal of gaining
Soviet consent for the use of force should peaceful measures fail.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said military
might should not be ruled out, but cautioned it should be used only
under U.N. auspices.
   ``A situation may emerge which effectively would require such a
move,'' Shevardnadze told reporters after meeting with Baker.
Before the crisis, Moscow was Baghdad's principal ally and
principal weapons supplier.
   Bush, at his news conference, said ``we're on the same
wavelength'' with Gorbachev in terms of his policy goals in the
Middle East. He said he felt there were no ``mixed signals'' from
Moscow.
   The Bush administration, impatient that months of U.N. economic
sanctions have failed to dislodge Saddam's troops from Kuwait,
intends to ask the U.N. Security Council to authorize force if the
Baghdad government doesn't agree to a pullout.
   The 11 British women left today for Baghdad, where they hope to
ask Saddam to release their husbands and relatives on humanitarian
grounds.
   The British Foreign Office advised the women against going and
called the trip ``risky,'' but they ignored the advice.
   Hundreds of Americans are among those still trapped in Iraq,
some held at strategic sites as ``human shields'' to deter attack
by the U.S.-led multinational force in the region.

   The man accused of shooting to death radical
Rabbi Meir Kahane reportedly was taking the anti-depressant Prozac,
which has been blamed by some users for suicidal and homicidal
behavior.
   Police confirmed Friday that El Sayyid Nosair was taking an drug
for depression, but would not say which one. The New York Times
reported he was taking the prescription drug Prozac.
   The drug's manufacturer, Eli Lilly &amp; Co. Inc., has denied any
connection between Prozac and aberrant behavior, a position
reiterated Friday by company spokesman Edward A. West.
   ``According to press reports, the shooting of Rabbi Kahane
appears to have been a premeditated act by a distressed individual
who was under a doctor's care and may have been taking multiple
drugs,'' West said.
   ``Ongoing analysis of controlled, double-blind clinical trials
do not support a causal relationship between Prozac and violent
behavior,'' he said.
   But several lawsuits against Eli Lilly cite the drug as a
catalyst for murder and self-mutilation.
   The son of a Kentucky man who killed eight people in a 1989
shooting rampage while taking Prozac has sued the maker, contending
the drug is unsafe. A Long Island woman who suffered through 18
months of self-mutilation while on the drug also has sued the
company for $150 million.
   Prozac's known side effects include nausea, a rash, agitation
and jittery nerves.
   Nosair, 34, remained in fair condition Friday in the intensive
care unit of Bellevue Hospital, said spokeswoman Karen Crowe. She
refused to comment about medication.
   He has been hospitalized since the Monday night shooting of
Kahane, an anti-Arab extremist. Nosair, who is from Egypt, was
wounded during an exchange of gunfire with a U.S. Postal police
officer as he fled the slaying, taking a bullet in the throat,
authorities said.
   Investigators have not linked Nosair, of Cliffside Park, N.J.,
to any terrorist groups.
   Once out of intensive care, Nosair will continue his recovery at
the Bellevue medical unit for prisoners, Crowe said.
   Police have speculated Nosair's depression stemmed from job
frustration. Nosair, who has an engineering degree, was employed by
the city as a heating and air conditioning mechanic.

   Charles Cooper has been appointed editor and
senior vice president of The Houston Post, succeeding C. David
Burgin.
   Burgin, 51, will assume the same positions at the Alameda
Newspaper Group, publisher of four daily newspapers in Northern
California.
   Publisher William Dean Singleton announced the changes Thursday.
The Post and the California newspapers are members of Singleton's
Houston-based MediaNews Group.
   Cooper, 47, has been managing editor of the Post for the past
two years.
   ``Charles Cooper is one of the key architects of changes at the
Post over the last two years,'' Singleton said. ``Our readership
gains have been solid. Our change in editors doesn't mean any
change in direction.''
   Cooper came to the Post in 1988 from the Dallas Times Herald,
where he was assistant managing editor. Before that he was with the
San Francisco Examiner for 14 years, serving in news and sports
editorships. He is a past president of the national Associated
Press Sports Editors organization.
   Cooper grew up in Midland and graduated from the University of
San Francisco. He served seven years in the Army.
   Before joining the Examiner in 1974, Cooper worked at the
European Stars and Stripes, the Overseas Media Group in Germany,
and as a freelance writer in Spain and California.
   Singleton praised Burgin's ``magnificent job in turning The
Houston Post in the right direction,'' and said Burgin's departure
leaves him with ``a lot of mixed emotions. We're very, very
close.''
   Burgin, a native of Somerset, Ky., and a graduate of Miami
University in Ohio, previously served as editor of the San
Francisco Examiner, the Orlando (Fla.) Sentinel and the Peninsula
Times Tribune in Palo Alto, Calif. He also had been sports editor
at the Examiner and at The Washington Star and the Washington Daily
News.
   Earlier in his career, he was Capitol Hill and White House
reporter for Scripps-Howard News Service and a foreign
correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune.

   Hardly a fair contest, maybe, but hot rod
enthusiasts cheered a measure of revenge Friday for a 13,000-pound
``monster truck'' that squashed a row of Volvos.
   Some in the crowd figured the little guy deserved getting bashed
this time, the response of the U.S. Hot Rod Association to a Volvo
television commercial that has been pulled from the air.
   ``I loved it. It was great. They had it coming to them,'' said
Billie Burns, who brought three children ages 4, 2 and 8 months
from nearby Folcroft to the exhibition in the parking lot of the
Spectrum sports arena. The trucks had arrived for a weekend
competition at the Spectrum.
   She was not impressed with the way the Volvos held up briefly
before succumbing to ``Bearfoot'' and its 1,000-pound tires.
   ``They were stomped,'' she said with a grin.
   In Pittsburgh, however, another monster truck had big trouble
with a Volvo. ``Big Boss'' and its 800-pound tires got stuck on a
1975 green Volvo in the parking lot of Civic Arena.
   Burns, like some other spectators, said they came to see Volvo's
comeuppance for an ad in which a Volvo appeared to be the only car
left relatively intact in a line of autos run over by Bearfoot.
   The Texas attorney general challenged the ad and the company
pulled it this week, saying that unknown to Volvo, the Volvo in the
line of cars had been reinforced.
   Friday, Bearfoot and two other monster trucks, Predator and
Black Stallion, took turns getting their own licks in as TV crews
and a small crowd watched.
   ``We don't have a knock against Volvo,'' Hot Rod Association
spokesman Steve Greenberg said. ``We're doing this in good-natured
fun. It is tongue-in-cheek.''
   ``There is a reputation to uphold here,'' he added, citing
questions caused by the ad about the power of the monster trucks,
which he said draw 4 million fans a year to events around the
country.
   The junked Volvos in Philadelphia were no match over the long
haul. But the trucks needed a few swipes to get the job done. The
roar of the trucks drowned the crowd's cheers with each pass.
   The white-and-blue Predator crushed a line of five cars - a
Pontiac, three Chevys and a Volvo in the middle. The roof of the
Volvo wagon held up enough that it might have protected passengers.
   Then Black Stallion took one run at a line of six Volvos,
breaking them in for four runs by Bearfoot. One on the end gave the
trucks particular trouble before giving way. Bearfoot finally
finished it by coming at an angle to smash another that had roof
supports still standing, coming to rest on the crushed car.
   Bearfoot driver Todd Blaeser said he was surprised by how well
the Volvos held up. Usually, he said, a line of cars would be
finished off in two or three runs.
   Asked if Volvo had passed the test, he looked at the pile of six
crushed cars with the metallic blue truck on top of it and said,
``It doesn't look like it, does it?''
   ``We've run into Volvos that have stood out in a pile of cars as
being tougher,'' said Blaeser, 23, of Chippewa Falls, Wis.
   Volvo spokesman Robert Austin watched the car stomping on
television from his office, and said while the Volvos ``didn't come
out unscathed,'' they appeared to hold up well compared with other
cars.
   At one point, the Predator got stuck on the Volvo on its third
pass over the five cars.
   ``It was apparent that the Volvo was standing up to the full
weight of the truck. So I would leave it to the public to draw
their own conclusions,'' Austin said.

   A Continental Express flight from Houston
to Jackson landed at a private airfield seven miles from the
commercial airport where it was due.
   The ATR-42 turboprop was carrying 33 passengers when it landed
Thursday night at Hawkins Field rather than Jackson International
Airport in nearby Rankin County, airline spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney
said.
   She said the crew was grounded Friday while officials tried to
determine what went wrong.
   Hawkins Field had served as Jackson's commercial airport until
1963, when the other airport opened.
   The crew was flying into the area for the first time, Federal
Aviation Administration officials said.
   ``This sort of thing is unfortunate. It happens once in a
while,'' said Jacques Lonchambon, an operations inspector with the
FAA in Houston.
   Mahoney said passengers on Flight 2682 were taken to hotels or
to Jackson International Airport.
   Continental Express is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Houston-based Continental Airlines.

   A small tremor caused no damage or
injuries but heightened concerns about a major earthquake that has
been forecast for the area.
   Thursday night's quake measured 3.6 on the Richter scale and was
felt in at least three states - Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee.
   The quake struck along the New Madrid Fault, which produces
hundreds of tremors a year, but most are hardly felt.
   Iben Browning, a New Mexico climatologist, has forecast a 50-50
chance for a major earthquake along the fault on or about Dec. 3.
   ``That's why you're hearing about this one,'' geophysicist Russ
Needham said of Thursday night's quake. ``Had it been a year ago,
it would have been reported and that's about it.''
   Many scientists have criticized Browning's methods and
conclusions.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake,
capable of widespread heavy damage.

   Former Contra rebels attacked a police
station in eastern Nicaragua on Friday, leaving three guerrillas
dead in the most violent anti-government clash in months, a Cabinet
official said.
   Thirty-five people, including nine police officers, were wounded
in the battle, said Interior Minister Carlos Hurtado.
   The attack appeared to be part of a growing weeklong protest in
the eastern half of the country of President Violeta Chamorro's
economic policies, her administration's ties with the opposition
leftist Sandinistas and a failure to keep promises of resettlement
aid to demobilized Contras.
   Hurtado told reporters the attack in Nueva Guinea, about 190
miles east of Managua, took place before dawn. He said 21 people
were arrested, but only five were held on weapons charges. Hurtado
said the three dead were former Contras.
   The attackers fired on the station with AK-47 assault rifles,
then fled to a nearby church where they surrendered, Hurtado said.
   The dissidents seized government buildings in another eastern
town Thursday night. The protests started last week by blocking the
main highway linking eastern and western Nicaragua. It remained
barricaded Friday.
   Armed forces chief Gen. Humberto Ortega has threatened to use
the army to clear the road, but so far the military has taken no
action.
   Protesters have demanded withdrawal of all Sandinista-controlled
security forces along the Rama road and the removal of Hurtado, the
Cabinet official in charge of internal security, and Mrs.
Chamorro's son-in-law Antonio Lacayo.
   Lacayo is Minister of the Presidency and holds most of the power
behind the scenes in the administration.
   Much of the resentment stems from Mrs. Chamorro's decision to
keep the Sandinistas in control of the military and police.

<HEAD>Mary Robinson, Ireland's President-elect, Represents Something New</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Ireland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Robinson is a woman of forceful
opinions about the rights of women and minorities, opinions she
will be obliged to keep to herself as president of Ireland.
   ``That doesn't really worry me,'' she said late in her campaign.
   ``If I'm elected, that's an enormous boost .. and my views are
known. What I would represent is more space and more pluralism and
more tolerance - just by being elected.''
   Mary Robinson is the first woman and the first candidate of the
left to be president of Ireland.
   ``The president is the honorific and symbolic head of state,''
said Tom Garvin, lecturer in politics at University College in
Dublin. By tradition, they are expected to be above politics.
   In 1976, when President Cearbhall O Dalaigh exercised his power
to refer legislation to the Supreme Court for review, there was
such an uproar in Parliament that he felt compelled to resign.
   If Mrs. Robinson decides to challenge the traditional
constraints placed on Irish presidents, it won't be the first time
she has challenged the status quo.
   When Mrs. Robinson entered the Senate in 1969, she was the first
Roman Catholic to represent Trinity College, a historically
Protestant institution. And, at age 25, she was Ireland's youngest
senator and Trinity's youngest professor of law.
   Born in the County Mayo town of Ballina, Mary Bourke grew up in
a country that was deeply conservative and dominated by the Roman
Catholic Church.
   Her parents, both physicians, treated her the same as her four
brothers. ``Nobody ever expressed any surprise that I wanted to be
a lawyer, or to do anything different from the boys,'' she once
said.
   ``If she wanted something, she worked with it and got it ...
quietly and without fuss, but very purposefully,'' her father, Dr.
Aubrey Bourke, said on Thursday.
   She accepted a scholarship to Trinity College, which her church
then regarded as off-limits. When she married a Protestant, fellow
law student Nick Robinson, her disapproving parents refused to
attend the ceremony.
   After winning a first-class honors degree at Trinity, then a
masters in law from Harvard, she jumped into public life.
   She introduced legislation in the Senate in 1970 to make
contraceptives legally available, and tried again in 1973 and 1974.
In 1976, she proposed that Ireland legalize divorce.
   She won court cases to permit women to serve on juries, to
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality, to restore inheritance
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators such
as herself the same pension rights as their male colleagues.
   Contraceptives were made available by law to ``bona fide
couples'' in 1979 and to anyone over 18 in 1985, but the ban on
divorce was upheld in a national referendum in 1986. Abortion is
still illegal.
   Though she is president of Cherish, which supports single women
who decide to carry pregnancies to term, she also represented
students at Trinity College who were providing information about
the availability of abortion in Britain.
   ``The denial of information is simply putting a further load on
women who are going to go anyway,'' she said in a recent interview.
   ``The statistics in England show that the numbers are remaining
at the same level but they are going later, at greater risk. I
think that is very cruel and very inhumane,'' she said.
   The decision to run for president, Mrs. Robinson has said, was
not entirely her own: it was put to a vote around the dinner table
and approved by her husband, her daughter, Tessa, 18, and sons
William, 16, and Aubrey, 9.
   Tall, slender and a bit reserved, Mrs. Robinson began
campaigning for the largely ceremonial office in May. Her staff
estimates that she rolled up 25,000 miles crisscrossing the country
in a bus that relentlessly blared an insipid instrumental version
of the Simon and Garfunkel tune, ``Mrs. Robinson.''
   The candidate's intention was to shake up the country and to
challenge a front-runner who, she said, simply offered ``more of
the same.''
   Asked what she thought was wrong with her country, she said:
   ``Irish society isn't sufficiently pluralist for a start,
insufficiently tolerant of difference. We haven't got it in our
constitution, in our laws or in our ethos.''
   As president, she said she would make the sprawling official
mansion in Dublin's Phoenix Park a forum for contact and discussion
for all manner of groups.
   The ``hand of friendship'' would also be extended, she said, to
the Protestants of Northern Ireland who reject any thought of
uniting with the republic she will head.

<TEXT>
   Commercial satellite companies are selling
photographs of the Persian Gulf that could provide sensitive
military details about Iraqi and U.S. troop deployments in the
region.
   The Pentagon has tried to keep secret operational information
about troops in Saudi Arabia, but has not made any move to block
satellite companies from selling the commercial film, spokesman
Rick Oborn said.
   Oborn said he had not seen any commercial satellite pictures but
said he would be concerned if they revealed operational
information. He said he knew of no attempts to block the sale of
the photos.
   Peter Zimmerman, a professor of applied sciences at George
Washington University, said the pictures made available by
Soyuzkarta, a Soviet trade organization, ``are among the finest
unclassified imagery I have ever seen.''
   A camera focused on an area could probably pick up the placement
of large vehicles, the site of a troop deployment and topographical
details such as trenches, he said. Individual people would be
indistinguishable.
   The pictures ``would be very useful'' for Iraqi and U.S. forces
in the gulf to help determine military information about the other
side, Zimmerman said.
   But Jeffrey Richelson, author of ``America's Secret Eyes In
Space,'' said a skilled photo interpreter is often needed to
identify objects from satellite pictures.
   Soyuzkarta is one of three commercial firms that sell satellite
photographs of the gulf. The other two are SPOT Image, a
French-owned company and Landsat, a U.S. concern.
   SPOT Image says it will sell pictures only to people with
security clearances to prevent the images from falling into Iraqi
hands; Landsat says its pictures of the gulf region show only sand;
Soyuzkarta says it tries to make sure only legitimate customers buy
the pictures.
   Soyuzkarta's photographs show items roughly 15 feet in size, and
have the highest resolution among the three companies. With
computer enhancement, the images are clearer.
   Velon Minshew of Fort Worth, Texas, a U.S. distributor for
Soyuzkarta, said the company has pictures of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and Iraq for the months of August and September. Each frame showing
an area 50-60 square miles sells for $1,560.
   Clark Nelson said SPOT Image's pictures show a resolution of
about 30 feet. The pictures sell for anywhere from $500 to $3,000.
   Generally, the Landsat pictures of the gulf region show ``a lot
of sand,'' cording to Dick Mroczynski, a company spokesman.
Landsat's pictures, much less clear than those of Soyuzkarta and
SPOT, were designed as a mapping tool, and are often used by
geologists and others trying to determine land formations.
   Under U.N. sanctions, the commercial satellite companies are
barred from selling pictures to Iraq.
   Minshew refused to say who has purchased Soyuzkarta's pictures,
but the company will sell to legitimate organizations who agree not
to transfer the information.
   Nelson of SPOT Image said his company sells photographs to the
Defense Department. ``We are not selling to the Iraqis or anybody
associated with the Iraqis,'' he said, and only those with ``proper
security procedures'' are allowed to purchase the pictures.
   Nelson said he knew nothing of a recent report in The Washington
Times that said Iraq is believed to have obtained satellite
pictures indirectly from SPOT Image. The newspaper cited U.S.
intelligence sources as its source.
   Television networks have not made wide use of the satellite
pictures, although CBS' ``60 Minutes'' program showed a photograph
purporting to show a uranium mine in Iraq. An interpreter pointed
out the images.
   Spokesmen for CBS, ABC, NBC and CNN said their networks were not
using other gulf pictures.
   John Stack, the foreign assignment editor at NBC, said the
network has used satellite pictures in the past to show, among
other things, the nuclear explosion at Chernobyl in the Soviet
Union.
   Electronic images provided by commercial satellites are not
nearly as sophisticated as the data sent by intelligence
satellites, Richelson said.

<HEAD>Belgium Orders Investigation into Secret Anti-Communist Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium has ordered an investigation
into the activities of a secret group formed during the Cold War to
fight potential communist invaders in several NATO countries, an
official said Friday.
   Defense Minister Guy Coeme said his government suspected the
little-known group might be linked to a series of murders around
Brussels between 1983 asnd 1985.
   The inquiry was launched after speculation was raised in Italy
that the Italian branch of the organization, known as Operation
Gladio, might have orchestrated right-wing terrorism.
   The anti-Communist groups were organized in the 1950s and
operated in several other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, including Greece and Portugal.
   They set up information and communication networks and also had
a special sabotage division to be put to se in case of a communist
invasion, officials of both Italy and Belgium said.
   Cells of the secret network were active in Portugal during the
1950s to defend the rightist government of dictator Antonio
Oliveira Salazar, according to a radio report in Lisbon on Friday.
   The Greek defense minister, Yannis Varvitsiotis, said Friday the
CIA helped set up a similar network in Greece in 1955 to organize a
guerrilla war against any communist invader. Known as Operation
Sheepskin, it was dismantled by 1988, he said.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, who has headed the Belgian
government almost continuously since 1979, said he was never
informed of the existence of the Belgian arm of the group, which he
said was set up by the Belgian military.
   ``It was not an official network,'' Martens told a news
conference Friday.
   He said, however, that NATO knew of the groups' activities,
although they were not an official part of the organization.
   ``This network is a complete anachronism. We favor abolishing
it,'' Martens said.
   Italy has asked NATO to investigate whether the secret groups
are still needed.
   NATO spokesman Florent Swijsen declined comment on the groups,
saying: ``NATO's established practice on matters of military
secrecy is not to provide information or to comment in any way.''
   Coeme said Operation Gladio cell officials met in Brussels two
weeks ago ``to see whether it was still useful to have this kind of
service,'' considering the growing East-West cooperation.
   In Italy, speculation abounds that the group was involved in
right-wing terrorism during the 1970s and 1980s. However, Italian
Premier Giulio Andreotti said Thursday he had no evidence that any
crimes were committed in Operation Gladio.
   Belgium is investigating whether it was involved in a series of
supermarket attacks and robberies that left at least 28 people dead
between 1983 and 1985.
   The attackers were always more bent on killing than stealing.
The violent incidents have often been linked by authorities to
right-wing terrorism. Police have made little progress in the case.

<HEAD>Cyanide Leak Into River PoisonsWater Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS GINSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cyanide leak into a river in the Soviet
republics of Byelorussia and Latvia has poisoned water supplies to
several cities and caused at least two people to become ill,
officials said Friday.
   The leak into the Daugava River, apparently from a chemical
weapons plant, occurred sometime between Oct. 31 and Nov. 5, said
authorities in the two republics.
   They said officials of the plant, which makes chemicals for use
in chemical weapons, never told them about the leak.
   ``It is just the same as Chernobyl. We only learned that
something went wrong when we saw fish floating belly up down the
stream,'' said Latvian Deputy Prime Minister Ilmar Bisher. He
referred to the 1983 nuclear power plant disaster in the nearby
Ukraine.
   ``Two men ate a (fish) and got minor poisoning. We hope there
will be no more cases,'' said Bisher, head of a Latvian commission
investigating the leak.
   Local officials were still testing the waters and trying to
determine how much of the chemical had leaked.
   ``Some say it was only three tons, other reports mention up to
60 tons,'' said Mayor Andris Inkulis of Riga, the capital of the
Latvian republic.
   Drinking water from the river was turned off in Riga on
Thursday, said Viktor Yukhno, the controller at Latvia's government
water authority. The city of nearly 1 million gets one-third of its
water from the river, officials said.
   The city's residents have been using water from underground
wells and a lake, but pumps are not powerful enough to bring water
to taller buildings and many residents remain without water, Yukhno
said.
   Bisher said Riga's water reservoir was also contaminated and it
may take 10 days for river water supplies to be restored.
   ``This does not only affect Riga, but the whole (republic of
Latvia),'' Inkulis said in Stockholm, Sweden, where he was
visiting. ``We warned people over television and radio so they
could save some water.''
   Water also was cut to Daugavpils, a city of 150,000 about 120
miles east of Riga, Bisher said. Officials have trucked in water
for the city and other areas.
   Daugavpils gets three-quarters of its water from the Daugava,
but much of the contamination already has passed and water may be
turned back on by Saturday, he said.
   The chemicals apparently leaked from the plant in the
Byelorussian town of Novopolotsk, 480 miles upriver from Riga just
over the republic's border.
   ``We think the poison comes from the weapons factory, but they
don't tell us anything,'' Inkulis said. ``If only we had been told
when this happened right away, but we weren't and now the poison
runs out into the sea.''
   There was no word on the leak from plant officials or the state
press. Bisher said the plant is operated by the national
government's Chemical and Petrochemical Ministry.
   Preliminary analysis showed the chemical was either hydrogen
cyanide or potassium cyanide, Inkulis said.
   It was not clear how the leak occurred.
   It was impossible to determine how many people were affected in
Latvia or Byelorussia, because many have begun using well water in
recent years.
   Riga is the largest city on the river, lying at its mouth on the
Baltic Sea. But hundreds, possibly thousands, of other people live
in areas along the river and traditionally used the river for food
and drinking water.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Xanax for Treatment of Panic Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leading anti-anxiety drug has become the
first medication approved for panic disorder, officials said
Friday.
   An estimated 3 million Americans - 1 percent to 2 percent of the
population - will suffer from panic disorder in their lifetimes.
For more than half of them, it will disrupt their social and
working lives.
   The illness is characterized by repeated panic attacks, in which
a patient is struck by intense fear. By avoiding situations
associated with the attacks, some sufferers become housebound or
are unable to go outside alone.
   Symptoms of the attacks can include chest pain, shortness of
breath, dizziness, trembling and sweating, nausea and abdominal
distress. The symptoms often mimic a heart attack, which can lead
to an incorrect diagnosis, said officials of the Upjohn Co., which
makes Xanax.
   The Food and Drug Administration first approved Xanax in 1981
for the treatment for clinical anxiety and anxiety associated with
depression.
   Common side effects of Xanax in panic disorder-sufferers include
sedation and fatigue, but as is the case with anxiety treatment,
those reactions eased when the dose was reduced or as the
medication was continued, Upjohn said.
   However, because higher doses of Xanax may be needed for longer
periods of time to treat panic disorder, the FDA was concerned
about the potential for dependency on the drug.
   ``At higher doses and longer duration, there is potential for
physical dependency on Xanax and withdrawal symptoms when the drug
is stopped or reduced too rapidly,'' said FDA spokeswoman Eva
Kemper.
   ``Because of that possibility, Xanax must be withdrawn gradually
and under a physician's supervision,'' she said.
   A biochemical malfunctioning in the brain is believed to cause
panic attacks, the company said. Xanax, known generically as
alprazolam, can block the attacks by interacting with several
different systems in the brain.
   Upjohn studied alprazolam as a treatment for the disorder in a
two-phase study that involved more than 1,700 patients in more than
14 countries, the company said.

<HEAD>Children's Artwork From 1938 Found Behind Chalkboard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers pulling down a slate chalkboard in an
elementary school found buried treasure - chalk drawings elementary
school children had done a half-century earlier.
   The workers were preparing to cover the wall-length chalkboard
with a bulletin board at Concord Elementary School Tuesday. They
noticed the slate was loose, pulled it off and found a farewell
from the 6A Graduating Class of 1938.
   Further investigation turned up more artwork beneath another
chalkboard, apparently left behind by someone who couldn't bear to
erase them when new slates were installed over the worn ones 52
years before.
   The wall-length boards included six still-vivid colored chalk
pictures by student artists and the signatures of several dozen
children who attended Lily Lodmell's class.
   One of the names was of a now 64-year-old construction worker
who lives lives a few blocks away.
   ``That's me - No. 17. That's my signature,'' Carl Marra
exclaimed when he was summoned to the school.
   Marra, whose name was signed Marro then - a birth certificate
error he later corrected - is a lifelong resident of the South Park
neighborhood. Marra said he did not remember doing the blackboard
farewell, but added: ``I remember most of the kids. We all lived on
the same street.''
   Several of his long-ago classmates still live in the area, he
said.
   The chalk pictures are drawings of scenes in Norway, Portugal
and Italy on one board, and Holland, Sweden and Mexico on another.
   The room's present teacher, Bernice Moore, said her third-grade
students were very excited by the discovery. ``They talked about
what they must have been studying at the time ... probably about
those countries.''
   Principal Toby Gonzales informed the Seattle School District's
archives office of the find and taped off the area to protect it
while plans were made to put it on display in a hallway or
elsewhere.

<HEAD>One Congressman Concedes Defeat In Cliffhanger; Second Incumbent
Holds Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One final cliffhanger congressional
race remained in limbo Friday, a day after another close race ended
with an incumbent conceding defeat.
   Democratic Rep. Jim Bates of San Diego trailed Republican
challenger Randy Cunningham by 982 votes in the 44th District with
an unknown number of absentee ballots still to be counted. The San
Diego County registrar of voters said they would not be tabulated
until Tuesday.
   Bates, who was seeking a fifth term, had been reprimanded by the
House ethics committee last year for sexually harassing two female
aides.
   On Thursday, Democratic Rep. Douglas Bosco of Sebastopol
acknowledged he had lost a bid for a fifth term to Republican
developer Frank Riggs.
   Bosco trailed Riggs by 1,973 votes with an unknown number of
absentee ballots still uncounted, but an aide said the congressman
didn't believe those votes would change the outcome.
   Riggs tried to take advantage of the national savings and loan
scandal, claiming that Bosco had become a wealthy man by
``consorting with scoundrels'' who ran two local, failed S&amp;Ls.
   But Bosco's downfall seemed to be due to a strong showing by
Peace and Freedom Party candidate Darlene Comingore, who appealed
to liberals dissatisfied with Bosco's positions on environmental
and foreign policy issues. Comingore got nearly 15 percent of the
vote.
   Bosco's loss leaves the makeup of the newly elected Congress at
267 Democrats, 166 Republicans and one independent, with Bates'
seat still undecided. If Bates loses, the result would be a net
gain of eight seats for the Democrats and a loss of nine for the
GOP.
   In California, Democrats held 27 of the state's 45 House seats
before the election and the Republicans held 18. If Bates loses,
Democrats will hold 26 seats and the Republicans 19.

   The presidents of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania on
Friday asked countries planning to sign the most comprehensive arms
control treaty in history not to legitimize the Soviet Union's
claim to the Baltic states.
   They also said at a summit in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital,
that their states should be separately identified in the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty.
   The accord covers weapons and troops in Europe from the Atlantic
Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union and is to be the
centerpiece for a 34-nation summit Nov. 19-21 in Paris.
   The treaty covers deployment of tanks, anti-aircraft artillery
and other non-nuclear arms in four European zones, including the
Baltics.
   The three presidents said treaty signatories should explicitly
state that Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia were never legally
incorporated into the Soviet Union.
   Presidents Vytautas Landsbergis of Lithuania, Arnold Ruutel of
Estonia and Anatoly Gorbunov of Latvia asked signatories to
``refrain from legitimizing the presence of or any additions to the
Soviet armed forces on their (the Baltics') territory.''
   ``Silence on this issue might be construed by the Soviet Union
as tacit recognition of the forcible incorporation of the Baltic
States into the Soviet Union,.''
   In an appeal reported by Baltic news services, the leaders said
the Baltics should be separately identified in the treaty so they
could control its implementation on their territory.
   Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia together have a population of 8
million people. The three states are in various stages of drives to
break out of the Soviet Union, which annexed them in 1940 in a deal
with Nazi Germany.
   The Baltic presidents failed in their bid to be invited to the
Paris summit as observers, but Landsbergis told a news conference
Friday, ``We hope to participate in the conference at least as
guests of a delegation of one of the countries that takes part.''

   Mary Robinson, a feminist lawyer elected
as the first woman president in Ireland's history on Friday,
thanked the country's womn who ``instead of rocking the cradle ...
rocked the system.''
   ``I don't know whether to dance or to sing. I have done both and
I hope to do more,'' she said after being declared the winner of a
tradition-shattering presidential campaign.
   Mrs. Robinson finished with 52.8 percent of the vote, overtaking
former deputy prime minister Brian Lenihan, the nominee of the
dominant Fianna Fail party, in the second round of counting.
   The 46-year-old attorney and professor of law was the first
woman elected president, and the first to beat Fianna Fail in a
contested presidential election.
   ``We were up against the might and the money and the very
effective machine of the greatest political party in this country
and we beat them,'' said Mrs. Robinson.
   She pledged to work for the poor, the homeless, the sick and the
unemployed and ``above all the women of Ireland who are still
struggling in the long march to equality and equity.''
   ``To all those who have no voice or whose voice is weak I say
take heart, there is hope.
   ``Look what you did in this election. You made history.''
   Her support, she said, came from ``men and women of all parties
and none, by many with great moral courage who stepped out from the
faded flags of the civil war and voted for a new Ireland, and above
all by the women of Ireland - the women of Ireland who instead of
rocking the cradle ... rocked the system.''
   By tradition, Ireland's presidents are above politics, and Mrs.
Robinson had acknowledged that winning would mean an end to the
battles she had fought to legalize divorce and contraception, and
to make information available on abortion.
   She has said that she intends to open the sprawling presidential
mansion to an array of interest groups. That invitation was open,
she said, even to the Protestants of Northern Ireland, who reject
any thought of unifying the island.
   Mrs. Robinson will be inaugurated Dec. 3, succeeding Patrick
Hillery, who must retire after serving two seven-year terms.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey congratulated Mrs. Robinson and
pledged his support, but her victory was an embarrassment for his
party and prompted talk of a challenge to his leadership.
   Lenihan led with 44.1 percent of the vote to 38.9 percent for
Mrs. Robinson after the first round of counting. Since neither had
a majority, the result turned on the second choices of the 17
percent who had voted for Austin Currie, the Fine Gael party's
nominee.
   Nearly 85 percent of that vote went to Mrs. Robinson, who is an
independent but was nominated by the Labor and Workers parties.
   The two parties had combined for only 14.7 percent of the vote
in last year's parliamentary elections, and Mrs. Robinson was the
first candidate from the left to win a presidential campaign.
   Fianna Fail had monopolized the office since 1945.
   The Irish Press, traditionally a Fianna Fail supporter, said the
election ``signals a change in Irish society and a shift away from
traditional attitudes and allegiances.''
   In 20 years in the Irish senate and as an attorney, Mrs.
Robinson battled church and state in efforts to legalize divorce
and contraception. In Ireland's deeply conservative society, she
was regarded as a radical.
   She won court cases to permit women to serve on juries, to
overturn laws criminalizing homosexuality, to restore inheritance
rights for illegitimate children and to give women legislators the
same pension rights as their male colleagues.
   Contraceptives were made available by law to ``bona fide
couples'' in 1979 and in 1985, to anyone over 18. However, the ban
on divorce was upheld in a national referendum in 1986.
   Mrs. Robinson says she personally opposes abortion, but she
recently represented students who sought to distribute information
about the availability of abortion in Britain.
   Raised as a Roman Catholic, she defied her parents by marrying a
Protestant, Nick Robinson, a fellow student at Trinity College.
   Robinson took three months off from his own legal practice to
work in the campaign, which had been launched only after a
favorable vote from their three children, Tessa, 18, William, 16,
and Aubrey, 9.

<HEAD>Young Farmers Adapt to Changes in Agriculture</HEAD>
<HEAD>By JOSEPH COLEMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national organization that has
represented young farmers for more than a half century is making
changes to adapt to an era of farmers with business suits and MBAs
who work with computerized tractors.
   But some fear the spirit of the traditional farmer may be lost
in the shuffle.
   Two years ago, to keep up with the times, Future Farmers of
America updated its name to the National FFA Organization.
   This week, delegates at the organization's 63rd annual
convention voted to reword the farmer's four-paragraph
``agriculture, education and citizenship'' creed to reflect changes
in the industry.
   Among the changes, they replaced ``the future of farming'' with
``the future of agriculture,'' and ``rural America'' with
``American agriculture.''
   ``Agriculture has changed in many ways,'' said C. Coleman
Harris, the FFA national executive secretary. ``The farm operator
has so many different people to deal with.''
   Harris said the FFA was attempting to broaden a spotlight
formerly focused only on farmers to encompass engineers,
biotechnicians, business specialists and computer scientists.
   ``There are so many others that need to get under that
umbrella,'' Harris said.
   But some members think changing the creed is going too far.
   ``They are cutting out the words `farmer' and the basis of
farming,'' said David Bowles, 15, an FFA member from Sarasota, Fla.
   Eric Frederick, 27, an agriculture teacher at Marion County
Technical Center in Farmington, W.Va., said he would rather see a
new emphasis that incorporates changes in the industry without
ignoring the old values.
   ``I don't agree with all of it,'' he said of the changes.
   Still, it was difficult to find anyone among the more than
20,000 members at the convention who said he was a farmer. The
crowd was full of future veterinarians, businessmen and women, and
fertilizer experts.
   Kevin Stone, 17, from Onita, Ill., works part-time in a grocery
store while he prepares for a career as a businessman dealing in
fertilizer and crops.
   ``It's not really the farming industry,'' Stone said. ``There
are lots of jobs you can get without having a farming background.''
   Even members who fit the mold of the traditional farmer
acknowledged the changes technology has meant for farming.
   Mark Stalder, 17, of Junction City, Kan., was raised on his
family's ranch without computers. He said working with new
computerized tractors was ``like being born again.''
   Stalder said he is taking courses in horticulture, crop
production and animal and environmental science to prepare for his
career as a farmer.
   But despite his fancy education, he said his parents won't have
any trouble keeping him on the ranch.
   ``I was born there, and I plan on living there for the rest of
my life,'' he said.

<HEAD>General Assembly Rejects Iraqi Attempt to Debate U.S. Buildup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. panel rebuked Iraq on Friday by
unanimously refusing to consider a resolution that would have
denounced the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   The Iraqi motion said the gulf crisis began Aug. 7, when U.S.
forces began arriving in Saudi Arabia to counter Iraq's army.
Iraq's draft did not even mention Kuwait, which it overran on Aug.
2 and has declared is its 19th province.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering called the Iraqi attempt to
introduce the General Assembly resolution ``ill-founded,
tendentious and mendacious.''
   Pickering noted that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia invited Washington
to send troops to defend them. The U.N. Charter's Article 51 allows
nations to defend themselves against aggression either alone or
with allies.
   The Iraqis tried to introduce the motion in the assembly's
General Committee, a 29-member panel with broad geographic
representation. The committee assigns items to the agenda and
considers requests for new resolutions.
   Iraqi delegate Adnan Ahmed Mohammed said he had rewritten his
speech to the committee since Thursday, when President Bush ordered
200,000 more U.S. troops be sent to the gulf to give the
international force opposing Iraq an ``adequate offensive military
option.''
   The American move will nearly double the current U.S. strength.
There are now 230,000 U.S. military personnel in the region. Allies
from 26 other countries have sent about 70,000 of their own
soldiers.
   Iraq has deployed an estimated 430,000 soldiers in Kuwait and
southern Iraq since invading its oil-rich neighbor in a dispute
over land, oil and money.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said a new
Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force
would make the U.S. military buildup legal under the U.N. Charter:
``If it is in the context of Article 42, even though I would regret
any recourse to force, it would be legitimate,'' he said.
   Diplomats in New York and U.S. officials in Washington have
confirmed the United States has prepared a resolution that would
authorize force under Article 42, but is waiting to introduce it
until Secretary of State James A. Baker III has lined up enough
support among U.S. allies on the Security Council.
   Mohammed, the Iraqi delegate, said Bush and U.S. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney ``blew the horns of war'' in announcing the
dispatch of new Americans troops. He called it proof of the
``aggressive schemes against Iraq and the Arab nation.''
   ``Are we approaching a catastrophe? Are we expecting a tragedy
to take place?'' Mohammed asked.
   He accused the United States of thwarting any attempts at an
Arab diplomatic solution. He said Washington had ignored Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 12 proposal that an Iraqi
withdrawal be linked to establishment of a Palestinian homeland.
   Bush has rejected any specific conditions for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait, but he has said other issues in dispute
could be discussed after a pullout.
   In a scornful voice, Kuwaiti Ambassador Mohammad A. Abulhasan
rejected the proposed Iraqi resolution. He said it was the ``Iraqi
regime that launched an unjustified, unprovoked attack against
Kuwait.''
   Other delegates who assailed the Iraqi proposal were from Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, Senegal, Czechoslovakia,
France, Honduras and Canada.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Friday
neared the end of a trip seeking support for possible military
action against Iraq, confident that Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other
Arab forces would fight alongside U.S. troops but less certain
about France.
   A senior official on the trip said it was still unclear ``where
the French would be.'' He commented as Baker headed into the trip's
final leg, which included talks with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher on Friday and French President Francois
Mitterrand on Saturday.
   He was also to meet in Paris with French Foreign Minister Roland
Dumas, who said in advance of the visit, ``The effort of France is
real and second-largest after the U.S.A. ... This is very clear
between the Americans and us.''
   Thatcher, a staunch supporter, said after her meeting with
Baker, ``Obviously, we stand absolutely together.''
   She said no further U.N. authority would be needed to take
military action against Kuwait but that she would back any U.S.
move for additional support from the world body.
   Referring to the nations arrayed against Iraq on the issue of
Kuwait, she said, ``We obviously would like to keep this coalition
together and so we are considering how best to do that.''
   Baker said before leaving Moscow for London on Friday that the
Soviets were disappointed with the results of their overtures to
Iraq and were no more optimistic than the United States about
President Saddam Hussein reversing his invasion of Kuwait.
   After Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent a special
emissary to Baghdad in September and again last month, reports
surfaced in Moscow that hopes of a negotiated settlement had been
raised.
   But Baker effectively deflated such a hopeful impression of
Yevgeny Primakov's mission.
   ``I don't think the Soviets are any more optimistic than we are
about the willingness of Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait,'' Baker
said.
   The senior U.S. official, commenting on condition of anonymity,
said Primakov was ``basically stiffed'' by Iraq.
   And yet, the official said of Saddam: ``Everybody knows he has
the capability to do a 180-degree (turnabout) on short notice.''
   ``But I don't know whether his antennae will be set in a
`receive' mode or not,'' the official said. ``We've seen no
evidence in all of the diplomatic activity that's taken place,
we've seen no evidence on the part of Saddam Hussein to even begin
to comply with the United Nations resolutions.
   He added that Gorbachev shares that view.
   Nearing the end of Baker's eight-day mission to seven countries,
the official said troops from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Arab states
in the Persian Gulf would fight alongside American forces in the
event of a war to liberate Kuwait.
   He said Syria's participation, as well as France's, was
uncertain.
   Despite a judgment that Syria fosters terrorism, the Bush
administration has tried to engage President Hafez Assad in the
alliance against Saddam. The Syrian leader offered up to 15,000
troops, but only about a third were sent to Saudi Arabia, where
most of the allied force is deployed.
   The senior official said, however, that Syria might end up
``leading the charge'' against Iraq.
   Assad and Saddam Hussein head rival factions of the Baathist
party and are bitter rivals. Syria stood alone among the larger
Arab states in backing non-Arab Iran in its eight-year war with
Iraq.
   When Baker left Washington last Saturday, one of his goals was
to see whether the four nations who are permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council along with the United States would support a
resolution authorizing the use of force as a last resort to evict
Iraq from Kuwait.
   Baker on Tuesday gained the acquiescence of Chinese Foreign
Minister Qian Wichen and a reluctant commitment on Thursday from
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Mrs. Thatcher's consent was a cinch, but Mitterrand, who has
been urging a negotiated settlement, may be difficult to convince.
Baker sees him Saturday in Paris.
   In light of the lukewarm reception on the journey, Baker said
Thursday night he was not on a decision-making trip. On Friday, he
said no resolution to use force was being prepared.
   Gorbachev, meanwhile, has urged that Saddam be approached
through some kind of ``Arab mechanism,'' and he said recently there
were ``now more arguments than ever in favor of saving the
situation by using the Arab factor.''
   On another subject, Baker said a treaty to cut non-nuclear
weapons in Europe still was not finished. He said the main problem
was failure to reach agreement with the Soviet Union on methods of
verifying adherence to the treaty's provisions and how the casts of
inspection would be apportioned.
   President Bush has said unless the Conventional Forces in Europe
treaty was ready to be signed he would not attend a 34-nation
summit meeting in Paris Nov. 19-21.
   Another nagging problem has concerned the forces the Soviets
would be permitted to keep in the areas of Leningrad and Kiev.
Baker and Shevardnadze agreed on terms near the end of their 13
hours of talks Thursday night.

   President Bush on Friday signed legislation
requiring colleges and universities to make public their graduation
rates, campus security procedures and campus crime rates.
   The legislation applies to any institution participating in
federal student aid programs.
   The institutions will have to certify to the Education
Department that they have campus security policies and will have to
distribute to students, prospective students and employees an
annual report of crime statistics.
   The bill also requires that the colleges provide students and
prospective students with graduation rates.
   The institutions must report to the education secretary, as of
July 1993, on the numbers and graduation rates of students who
receive athletic-related student aid. That information must be
broken down by race, sex and sport. The schools also must provide
this information to potential student athletes, their parents,
guidance counselors and coaches.

   Republican Gov. Kay Orr on Friday conceded
the governor's race to Democrat Ben Nelson, pledging she would work
with him.
   ``The counting of the absentee and disabled ballots has not
significantly changed the balance of total votes in the
gubernatorial election. Therefore, I am officially conceding the
election to Mr. Nelson,'' Mrs. Orr said in a statement.
   Mrs. Orr was out of the state on a previously planned vacation
and was not expected to return until Thursday, said Cindy Evert, a

   Nelson defeated Mrs. Orr, the nation's first Republican woman
elected governor, in Tuesday's election by 4,658 votes in
unofficial returns, not including absentee ballots.
   County officials continued to work Friday on counting absentee
ballots and canvassing the tallies to certify the vote. But the
absentee vote count appeared to follow election night patterns.

   A jury awarded $77.8 million to a couple whose
baby was left paralyzed, mute and partially blind after he was
given an overdose of medicine at one hospital and an overdose of an
antidote at another.
   Stephen and Mary Blake of Skokie also were awarded $135,000 in
past medical expenses for their son, Andrew, now 5.
   A Cook County Circuit jury returned the decision Thursday
against Mead Johnson and Co., a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb;
Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center; Children's Memorial Hospital;
and Dr. Metta Wongsarnpigoon.
   Judge Charles Durham said the award was a record for Illinois.
   ``We are delighted with the award. It will provide for Andrew's
future,'' said Jerome Mirza, the Blakes' attorney.
   ``Our lawyers are in the process of reviewing the verdict and we
would not comment while it is under review,'' Bristol-Myers Squibb
said in a statement Friday.
   A Children's Memorial statement expressed sympathy for the
Blakes, but didn't say whether the hospital would appeal.
   Telephone calls to Ravenswood were not immediately returned
Friday. Directory assistance did not have a listing for
Wongsarnpigoon.
   The boy is paralyzed from his shoulders to his feet and requires
nursing care at least eight hours a day.
   The Blakes' lawyers had argued that dosage information Mead
Johnson provided for its expectorant Quibron was excessive and
outdated and caused Wongsarnpigoon, a pediatrician at Ravenswood,
to give Andrew an overdose.
   He had been hospitalized at Ravenswood for bronchiolitis and
possible asthma in January 1986.
   After the overdose, the boy - then 3 months old - started having
seizures, lawyers said.
   He was transferred to Children's Memorial, where he was given
Charcoaid, a prepacked mixture of charcoal and the anti-poison drug
sorbitol.
   The child received a massive overdose of sorbitol, became
dehydrated and suffered cardiac arrest and brain damage, according
to testimony in the six-week trial.
   The jury found the maker of Charcoaid - Requa Inc. of Greenwich,
Conn. - innocent of liability.
   ``We're thrilled that they recognized that the product was
safe,'' Requa attorney Joan Levin said.
   She said the company had argued that labeling on the product was
printed ``exactly per the requirements of the Food and Drug
Administration - no more, no less.''

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department has dropped a plan to
stop homeless people from sleeping on a steam grate just yards from
the street entrance to the office of Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh.
   Workers recently removed a partially constructed fence around
the steam grate. The fence drew protests in September from homeless
people and their advocates.
   The day of the protest, someone drove off with the iron gate,
which had not been installed by workmen.
   Until this week, the fence had stood without the gate. That
allowed homeless people to continue to sleep atop the grate, which
covers a vent to a steam tunnel that runs between the Justice
Department and several adjacent government buildings.
   Workmen planted holly bushes around the grate before removing
the uncompleted fence.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said the fence was to
be installed as a security measure.
   ``The attorney general never thought it was a good idea,''
Eramian said, adding that Thornburgh didn't know about plans to
build it until the day of the protest.
   A department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said an
alternative measure had been taken to prevent anyone from entering
the steam tunnel.

   An outlawed Protestant
paramilitary group said Friday its gunmen had killed a Roman
Catholic man.
   In a statement to the British domestic news agency, Press
Association, the Ulster Volunteer Force said four of its men shot
Malachy McIvor, in his early 40s, in a garage Thursday night in
Stewartstown, East Tyrone county.
   ``This war is not being waged against the Catholic community,
but against the Provisional IRA and until they cease their campaign
of genocide against the loyalist people, the war will continue,''
the statement said.
   The mainly Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to end
British rule and unite the province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland under a leftist administration.
Various Protestant groups oppose the IRA.
   Police said McIvor had no known links with any paramilitary
group and appeared t be the victim of a random sectarian attack.

   Raisa Gorbachev stepped out of the sleek,
black limousine Friday and she soon disappeared into an army of
photographers.
   Instead of getting a good look at one of the world's most famous
women, many well-wishers went home grumbling about freedom of the
press.
   ``This is scandalous!'' yelled an elderly lady struggling to see
Mrs. Gorbachev.
   ``It's not right the press gets to see Raisa and we ordinary
people don't,'' said the woman, who would only identify herself as
Gisela.
   A police officer trying to clear a path for Mrs. Gorbachev
shrugged and said, ``That's freedom of the press.''
   ``Freedom for whom? Not for us!'' the woman retorted.
   Mrs. Gorbachev visited Linz, a picturesque little city on the
Rhine River, while her husband, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, was meeting about 20 miles away in Bonn with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Her rousing welcome reflected her husband's immense popularity
in Germany.
   The side trip by Mrs. Gorbachev was announced at the last
moment. City officials got just a few hours notice.
   ``We were driving down the autobahn and heard about this on the
radio,'' said one onlooker, Helmut Bittner of Leverkusen.
   ``Of course we would rather see Mikhail, but this visit is
important too,'' said Bittner.
   With Mrs. Gorbachev about to arrive, Bittner exuded enthusiasm
for the Soviet leader, saying Kohl should promise plenty of
financial aid to Gorbachev.
   ``We cannot forget we have Gorbachev to thank for unification,''
said Bittner.
   ``It's in our interest that the Soviet Union remains stable. How
would anyone feel if we woke up tomorrow and a general had taken
Gorbachev's place?'' said Bittner.
   He was in a crowd of several hundred standing in near-freezing
air on the square in front of Linz's 600-year-old city hall.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's Zil limousine showed up about 40 minutes late.
Despite the delay, the throng remained in the hope of seeing her.
   When her car finally arrived, she surprised everyone by telling
her chauffeur to stop short of the city hall. Dressed in a grey
winter coat, Mrs. Gorbachev went right to the throng, showing some
of her husband's celebrated zest for working the crowd. Cheers rang
out.
   But a legion of photographers and camera teams soon engulfed
her. Security men shoved photographers and reporters aside, who in
turn fell against Mrs. Gorbachev's well-wishers or stepped on their
toes.
   Mrs. Gorbachev then disappeared inside the city hall, where she
signed Linz's guest book.
   Most of her most ardent admirers, however, were stuck outside.

<HEAD>Arguments Given in Key Insider Trading Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Government lawyers urged a federal appeals court
Friday to reverse an important insider trading ruling because it
would hamper their ability to prosecute certain securities
violations.
   The arguments before the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
followed a decision overturning the conviction of a stockbroker
charged with trading on inside information about the 1986 takeover
of the Waldbaum supermarket chain.
   Federal prosecutors have asked the court to reverse the ruling,
which found there was insufficient evidence to show that the
information the broker received from a member of the Waldbaum
family was confidential.
   ``We believe this will open a gaping hole by providing an
essential safe harbor of trading by family members,'' SEC attorney
Paul Gonson said.
   Gonson's presentation included a lively debate with one of the
judges over why the SEC had never fully defined insider trading.
   ``Why doesn't the SEC promulgate a rule that tells all of us
what you think insider trading is?'' asked Judge Jon O. Newman.
``How are the people in the investment community supposed to
know?''
   Gonson said the SEC had tried to formulate a definition, but had
failed.
   ``The commission attempted this over a long period of time, but
decided it was better to leave it to be developed on a case-by-case
basis,'' Gonson said.
   All 12 judges of the court sat Friday to consider reversing the
2-1 decision issued May 2 by three of their other colleagues. The
hearing, called an ``en banc'' proceeding, is the last vehicle of
appeal in the federal judiciary before a case is taken to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   The appeals court did not issue a decision Friday.
   Chestman, a former broker with Gruntals &amp; Co., was convicted
last year of a series of crimes as a result of trades the
government said he made after receiving privileged information
about A&amp;P's takeover of Waldbaum Inc.
   The government had charged that Chestman learned of the planned
takeover from one of his clients, Keith Loeb, a nephew by marriage
to Waldbaum's founder, Ira Waldbaum.
   Evidence at trial showed that Loeb learned about the deal from
his wife, who in turn heard it from her mother, who was told by her
brother, Ira Waldbaum.
   Chestman's attorney, Elkan Abramowitz, said the earlier decision
should stand because there was no proof to show that Chestman knew
Loeb was privy to the company's business secrets.
   ``Not every conversation in a family situation is a breach of
fiduciary duty if revealed,'' Abramowitz said. ``In absence of a
breach of fiduciary duty, there can be no fraud.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Brodsky, however, claimed that all
the Waldbaum family members in the chain of communication knew the
information about the takeover was confidential, and that Chestman,
too, knew he was breaking the law.
   ``Chestman knew exactly what was happening. He was getting
non-public information from Loeb,'' Brodsky said.

   Germany marked the anniversary of the Berlin
Wall's collapse Friday, but some among the shivering crowds at
ceremonies said the joy of the event had faded because of pressing
economic problems.
   Friday was also the 52nd anniversary of the nocturnal rampage
against Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues that foreshadowed
the Holocaust. In East Berlin, about 3,000 Jews attended a
commemoration of the Nov. 9, 1938 Crystal Night pogrom, named for
the shattered glass left by Nazi thugs.
   A monument to German reunification - a four-foot-square section
of the dismantled wall - was unveiled at one of the border crossing
points where thousands of East Germans streamed across last year in
unheard-of freedom.
   The monument was inscribed with the message: ``Berliners came
together again.''
   But in contrast to the wild celebrations that began
spontaneously on Nov. 9, 1989, events for the first anniversary
drew smallish crowds. Newspapers printed sober editorials about the
problems of unemployment in the economically stunted former
communist part of Germany, which officially united Oct. 3.
   ``It's true a whole new world has opened up for us,'' said East
Berliner Erika Brut. ``One wants to celebrate, but there are so
many problems.''
   She and her husband, Thorsten Brut, 42, a teacher, were among a
few hundred people shivering in near-freezing weather late Friday
on Marx-Engels Square in East Berlin to watch a documentary of last
year's wall opening.
   ``Looking at the pictures, it all seems so long ago. Our lives
have changed completely in the last 12 months,'' Brut said.
   The main symbol of the former division of Berlin and Germany,
the Brandenburg Gate, was busy with a flea-market atmosphere of
rows of tables offering everything from Soviet army caps to chips
of the wall for sale.
   But the wall on which last year's celebration occurred is gone.
Six sections of it stand on a nearby square so visitors can see
what it looked like.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose policies allowed
the Soviet client governments of Eastern Europe to crumble, was
greeted Friday in Bonn with a hero's welcome.
   Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a 20-year treaty of
friendship and cooperation. Grateful German leaders said they hoped
they could help Gorbachev solve the Soviet Union's desperate
problems.
   Berlin's Jewish community for the first time held its main
commemoration of Crystal Night in the splendid Ryke Street
synagogue, in a working-class neighborhood of East Berlin.
   Heinz Galinski, leader of the Central Council of German Jews,
said the significance of the wall's opening ``remains a half-truth
if it conceals the earlier imprinted meaning of the date.''
   ``And half-truths are not a good foundation for building a
healthy future.''
   Galinski said Germans have never acknowledged fully the horrible
events that started on Kristallnacht. Six million Jews had died by
the time World War II ended in 1945 and Germany lay in ruins and
partition.
   Germany had 540,000 Jews before the war but only 30,000 now,
Galinski said. He recalled the words of Gen. Lucius D. Clay, one of
the American military commanders in Berlin: ``Democracy in Germany
will be measured by the extent Jews can live there.''
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, unveiling the wall monument at
Bornholmer Bridge, also referred to the memory of Crystal Night,
but concentrated on the immediate past and the future.
   ``For Germans, Nov. 9, 1989, was the happiest day in the postwar
era. Those who witnessed it will never forget,'' said the Social
Democrat.
   Momper will share the mayoralty with his East Berlin
counterpart, Tino Swierzina, until elections on Dec. 2 when unified
Germany holds its first parliamentary elections.
   The Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, met in
Berlin on Friday for the first time in 31 years, joined by newly
elected representatives from the five eastern states created when
East Germany joined the West.
   The rapid pace toward unification has thrust the nation into a
host of new problems. Lawmakers are faced with rising unemployment
in former East Germany and claims on property by Germans who fled
before the wall was erected in 1962.
   The subject of who deserves credit for the spontaneous opening
of the wall is still a point of debate.
   While East Germany's former Communist rulers have claimed some
responsibility, it was not clear whether their Nov. 9 decision to
permit freedom of travel meant freedom to emigrate permanently or
also permission to have unhindered contact with the West.
   Last week, a report in the former official Communist newspaper,
Neues Deutschland, said medium-level security officers decided on
their own to let the pressing crowds through the wall, fearing
border guards would be killed otherwise.
   ``It was the thousands of East Berliners who gathered at the
border crossing and demanded to be let through,'' Momper said.
``The power of the individual defeated the system of oppression in
former East Germany.''

<HEAD>Former CIA Agent Testifies To Iran-Contra Grand Jury</HEAD>

   WASHINGTON (P) - A former CIA station chief testified Friday to
a federal grand jury about his involvement in the secret Contra
resupply operation of former White House aide Oliver North.
   Joseph Fernandez was subpoenaed by Iran-Contra prosecutors who
are trying to piece together the precise roles in the affair played
by Ronald Reagan, George Bush and key officials at the CIA, the
State Department and the Pentagon.
   Reagan and Bush have said they didn't know North was overseeing
a private resupply network during a congressional ban on U.S.
military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1985 and 1986. Independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh is trying to determine if their denials are
truthful, say sources outside the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office
who are familiar with the four-year investigation.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for Walsh's office, refused to
comment on Fernandez's appearance or on any aspect of the probe.
Tom Wilson, a lawyer representing the former CIA station chief,
also declined to comment.
   Fernandez was compelled to testify under a court order granting
him immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. The
former CIA station chief in Costa Rica had faced criminal charges
of lying and obstruction to hide his involvement with North's
operation, but the Bush administration blocked the case from going
to trial last year.
   In 1985 and 1986, Fernandez acted as a go-between for North and
the Contras fighting in southern Nicaragua. As the head of CIA
operations in Costa Rica, he passed along information to pave the
way for air drops of weapons and assisted on an airstrip
construction project in Costa Rica that was to be part of the North
network.
   Fernandez also discussed the airstrip project with Elliott
Abrams, the assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs
who met frequently with North.
   Fernandez's CIA superiors told Congress in 1987 that they hadn't
been aware of all his activities on behalf of North. Fernandez
contradicted them, telling congressional investigators he kept the
agency informed at all times of precisely what he was doing and for
whom.
   If his case had gone to trial, Fernandez was prepared to show
that CIA stations and facilities in Honduras and El Salvador were
``all deeply involved in ... the resupply operation,'' according to
a recent federal appeals court decision and court papers filed in
the case.
   In court papers, Fernandez said he would have shown ``who at the
CIA supported the resupply operation, how they did it, where they
did it, why they did it, and who else at the CIA knew about it.''
   One period Walsh's investigators are focusing on is October
1986, according to the sources. On Oct. 5 of that year, a resupply
plane in North's network was shot down over Nicaragua, triggering a
political firestorm on Capitol Hill and threatening to expose the
operation.
   Reagan, Abrams and others in the administration stated
categorically that the U.S. government had no connection to the
shot-down flight. Abrams later said he found out from the CIA
nearly three weeks after the shootdown that there was a U.S.
government connection to the flight.
   Walsh's grand jury probe began last May. North has testified at
least half a dozen times and former national security adviser John
Poindexter at least twice. Also testifying was G. Philip Hughes, a
former aide to Bush when he was vice president and now U.S.
ambassador to Barbados.
   Walsh has said the grand jury probe may produce additional
indictments.
   North was convicted of aiding and abetting an obstruction of
Congress, destroying documents and accepting an illegal gratuity in
the scandal, but a federal appeals court panel set aside the
conviction. Poindexter was convicted in April of conspiracy, two
counts of obstruction and two counts of making false statements. He
is appealing. Six other people have entered guilty pleas or been
convicted in jury trials in the affair.

   The family of Miles Hoffman, who was shot
in the arm by Iraqi troops in Kuwait and held at a chemical plant
near Baghdad, said Friday they were elated that the 33-year-old
financial analyst has been freed. ``The first order of business
will be to take care of that arm,'' said Hoffman's brother,
Chancellor. ``He needs to get to the hospital.''
   Hoffman was one of three Americans and 174 other Westerners who
flew to freedom in Germany on Friday after talks between Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt. They had been detained since Iraqi forces overran Kuwait
Aug. 2.
   Hoffman's family said he was shot when Iraqi soldiers tried to
force their way into his Kuwait City apartment on Sept. 5. The
bullet shattered a bone in his left forearm and he was hospitalized
for about a week.
   He was later held at a strategic chemical plant 45 miles south
of Baghdad, they said. Westerners in Iraq have been used as ``human
shields'' to deter attack by the U.S.-led multinational forces
stationed in the Persian Gulf.
   Hoffman, 33, a financial analyst with the Kuwaiti government,
wore a cast on his arm and appeared to be in pain. Some reports
said gangrene had developed from the wound.
   ``It's just marvelous. It's just wonderful,'' Hoffman's mother,
Ann, said of his release.
   Mrs. Hoffman said she wasn't planning a welcome home party just
yet.
   ``If he wants one, we'll have one,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hoffman said her son probably will have other things on his
mind, such as getting a job.
   ``He'll do exactly what he wants to do,'' she said. ``But I
don't think he'll stay here.''
   Hoffman's British fiancee, 27-year-old Nicola Murgatroyd, was
scheduled to arrive in Baghdad on Friday.
   Ms. Murgatroyd, who had planned to marry Hoffman Aug. 17, was
among 11 British women who traveled to Baghdad Friday to seek the
release of their captive husbands and relatives - against the
advice of their government.
   The British Foreign Office advised the women against going and
called the trip ``risky,'' but they ignored the advice.
   Mrs. Hoffman, who wrote several letters to Saddam urging her
son's release, said she doesn't know Ms. Murgatroyd's whereabouts
or whether she knows Hoffman has been released.
   ``We're all thinking about Nikki,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo fired a Cabinet
minister and a provincial police chief on Friday after thousands of
villagers rioted to protest government plans to build a nuclear
waste dump.
   It was the nation's most violent anti-nuclear protest - with
about 22 people reported injured - and officials said plans would
be scuttled for a waste disposal facility on scenic Anmyon Island,
90 miles southwest of Seoul.
   By late Friday, about 3,000 riot police had fanned out to
restore order among the 50,000 residents.
   Police said 73 people were under arrest for inciting Thursday's
violence, when at least 10,000 men, women and schoolchildren
attacked government facilities and police vehicles with firebombs,
rocks and clubs.
   Television news showed men in business suits, laborers, elderly
women and young children jabbing fists in the air at an
anti-nuclear rally. Many wore headbands and sashes with
anti-government, anti-nuclear slogans.
   Four government officials, six police officers and about a dozen
residents were injured, some seriously, news reports said. A police
station was burned to the ground and two vehicles were destroyed,
reports said.
   Roh named Kim Jin-hyon, 56, a managing director of the Dong-A
Ilbo newspaper, to succeed Chung Kun-mo as minister of science and
technology, and he named a new chief police officer for the island.
   In Korea, public officials traditionally are fired and held
responsible for social unrest over government policies in their
jurisdiction.
   ``People are fearful of nuclear power and appear to
misunderstand nuclear waste,'' Chung said before leaving the
Cabinet.
   About 2,500 riot police firing tear gas launched a pre-dawn
attack Friday to recapture local government offices and police
stations bombarded by firebombs and rocks during the night.
   Police used tear gas again in the afternoon when hundreds of
villagers tried to rally. Protesters shouted anti-government,
anti-nuclear slogans. Witnesses said the situation appeared under
control late in the day.
   Hundreds of firebombs, anti-government placards, leaflets and
containers of paint thinner were confiscated Friday, police said.
About half the island shops and businesses were closed. Telephones
were out of order most of the day.
   News reports said most students stayed away from classes Friday.
Dozens of residents staged a sit-in at town offices demanding the
release of jailed residents, reports said.
   South Korea has nine nuclear power plants in operation and plans
to build more. The government has said it will run out of storage
facilities for tons of nuclear waste by 1994.
   Past protests involved minor clashes or peaceful rallies. Other
communities had successfully protested plans for a nuclear waste
dump.
   The plans for Anmyon Island were not made public, but apparently
involved both a waste dump and research facility. A newspaper first
reported the plans early in the week and islanders immediately
began protests, which initially were peaceful.
   Anmyon is a picturesque coastal island in the Yellow Sea and
plans exist to develop it into a tourist resort area. A causeway
connects it to the mainland.

   A dispute over whether there is a settlement
in a racketeering lawsuit brought against Imelda Marcos by the
Philippine government will go to a hearing next month, a federal
judge ruled Friday.
   The lawsuit is an attempt by the Philippines to recover some of
the billions of dollars the government of President Corazon Aquino
alleges was stolen during two decades of rule by the late President
Ferdinand Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos' attorney claims the government agreed to settle in
exchange for 60 percent of funds in Hong Kong bank accounts
controlled by the former first lady. The amount of the accounts was
not revealed.
   The Philippine government claims that only the groundwork for
settlement has been laid, but there is no settlement yet.
   If the agreement is carried out, it would be the first known
settlement between the government and the Marcoses.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer scheduled the evidentiary
hearing for Dec. 10, saying it was necessary because documents
submitted by both sides did not prove conclusively there was an
agreement.
   ``I don't believe there now is a settlement unless you have the
witnesses to testify,'' she told Mrs. Marcos' attorney, James P.
Linn.
   ``Our position is that we have an agreement and that the court
should enforce it,'' Linn said. He said among depositions he hoped
to present would be one from Mrs. Aquino.
   Attorney Ronald Olson, representing the Philippines, said,
``We're prepared to put our witnesses up to deny the existence of
an agreement.''
   Mrs. Marcos came to court but did not make any statements.
   Outside court, she tearfully complained to reporters that she
was tired of her legal battles and wanted to return to her homeland
with her husband's body, which is in Hawaii. The Philippine
government has refused to let Mrs. Marcos or her husband's remains
return.
   Mrs. Marcos said she has no idea how much money is in the Hong
Kong accounts and maintained that there was indeed a settlement
agreement.

<HEAD>Kahane Follower Suspected of Revenge Killing of Elderly Arabs</HEAD>

   A court on Friday ordered a follower of slain
Rabbi Meir Kahane held for five days on suspicion he killed two
elderly Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to avenge the
extremist rabbi's death.
   A judge of the Kfar Saba Magistrates Court in suburban Tel Aviv
ordered the continued detention of Ben Zion Gobstein, police
spokeswoman Ruth Shlezinger said.
   Gobstein was detained Thursday with two other members of
Kahane's anti-Arab Kach movement in connection with the shooting
deaths of a Palestinian man and woman, both in their 60s.
   The two other Kach members were released Friday, Ms. Shlezinger
said. They were identified as David Cohen and David Axelrod, a
great-grandson of the Russian revolutionary leader Leon Trotsky.
   All three lived in Kfar Tapuah, a Jewish settlement about four
miles north of the Palestinian village of Lubban Sharqiyah where
the two Arabs were slain Tuesday morning.
   In Jerusalem, police and the army blocked Palestinians from the
occupied territories from attending Friday prayers at the Al Aqsa
mosque.
   The army also ordered Palestinians in the West Bank not to
travel outside their towns and villages, apart from Bethlehem and
Ramallah, two large cities near Jerusalem. Widespread curfews were
imposed in the Gaza Strip, confining 150,000 Palestinians to their
homes.
   The measures were aimed at preventing vengeance attacks in the
still-tense atmosphere following Kahane's slaying by an
Arab-American in New York on Monday.
   Hundreds of police reinforcements were deployed near the Temple
Mount, site of the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques. It is
known in Arabic as Haram es-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary.
   The raised platform is the third holiest place in Islam, and the
adjacent Western Wall - commonly known in the West as the Wailoing
Wall - is the holiest site in Judaism.
   As a result of the precautions, fewer than 7,500 Palestinians
took part in the Friday prayers. Police reported no incidents.
   Meanwhile, Palestinians in the occupied areas observed the
second day of a general strike commemorating the 36th month of
their uprising against Israeli occupation.
   In the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian accused of collaborating with
the Israeli authorities was killed by fellow Arabs in the Shati
refugee camp. Fuad Hassan Abdallah, 25, was beaten and strangled to
death with an electric cord, Arab reports said.
   His death raised to 296 the number of Palestinians killed by
other Arabs since the uprising began in December 1987. Most were
accused of collaboration with Israel.
   At least 773 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians in the revolt. Fifty-two Israelis also have died.
   A Jerusalem Magistrates Court judge, meanwhile, ordered the
leader of Kahane's Kach party, Yekutiel Ben-Yaakov, freed from
jail. He had been held on suspicion of incitement after calling on
mourners at Kahane's funeral to avenge his death.
   Israeli newspapers in Friday weekend editions focused on
concerns over the climate of political violence in the country.
   The daily Maariv said ``the devil of hatred and fear'' had been
released with Kahane's death. ``Kahanism is not dead,'' warned Kol
Hair, a Jerusalem weekly.

<TEXT>
   Israeli forces on Friday destroyed bases of the
Shiite Moslem Hezbollah militia north of Israel's buffer zone in
south Lebanon, a day after the Jewish state pledged to guarantee
the safety of Lebanese Christians there.
   The army command said a combined force of tanks, artillery and
the elite infantry unit Givati hit its targets and returned safely.
It had no information on possible Hezbollah casualties.
   The army said the bases were near Jaba, Kfar Milki and Mazraat
Ayn Abu Siwar, from five to eight miles west of the Christian town
of Jezzine and about 12 miles from the northern tip of Israel's
self-proclaimed buffer zone. The area is controlled by the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia.
   The army said the bases were used ``for organizing and launching
attacks'' against Israeli troops and the SLA.
   Israel has become concerned about the situation in southern
Lebanon after rebel Christian Gen. Michel Aoun's fall in Beirut
last month.
   Jezzine fears Moslem militias pushed out of Beirut by the
government could move southward and threaten the town.
   Another fear is Lebanese President Elias Hrawi's plan to
implement a Syrian-backed peace accord designed to restore
government control over the war-torn nation, including the buffer
zone.
   On a visit Thursday to south Lebanon, Israeli Defense Minister
Moshe Arens promised the Israeli army will protect Jezzine, army
radio said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
signed an historic non-aggression treaty with united Germany on
Friday and won praise from German leaders for his role in the
peaceful fal of the Berlin Wall.
   Gorbachev's first visit to united Germany coincided with the
one-year anniversary of the opening of the wall and came just five
weeks after East Germany, Moscow's longtime Warsaw Pact ally,
merged into the new Germany.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Gorbachev stressed the
importance of the changes that have allowed closer ties between
Bonn and Moscow as they signed the broad agreement that is to serve
as the basis of future relations.
   But the Soviet Union's huge internal troubles were also part of
talks between the two leaders.
   After a state dinner for Gorbachev late Friday, the head of
Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, said emergency deliveries
of food and clothing to the Soviet Union may be needed this winter.
   ``Everyone is awaiting a very difficult, terrible and hard
winter,'' Daimler-Benz chief Edzard Reuter said of the situation in
the Soviet Union. ``There must be immediate help.''
   In the treaty, initialed in Moscow on Sept. 13, both nations
pledged not to attack the other and to honor the borders of all
European nations.
   ``We are closing the book on the painful past and clearing the
way for a new beginning,'' Kohl said in a speech at the signing
ceremony.
   After a short-lived alliance, Germany attacked the Soviet Union
at the start of World War II. About 26 million Soviets were killed.
   The new non-aggression treaty, one of three signed Friday,
replaces agreements that once linked the Soviet Union to West
Germany and East Germany. Moscow's ties to East Germany long
hindered better relations with Bonn.
   ``I have you to thank Mr. President, for the decisive
contribution so that Germany, our fatherland, could unify on Oct. 3
in peace and freedom and in agreement with all its neighbors,''
Kohl said at a joint news conference with Gorbachev.
   President Richard von Weizsaecker said the fall of the Berlin
Wall, which paved the way for unity, ``would not have been
possible'' without Gorbachev's political reforms.
   Earlier in the day, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stopped to
chat with a crowd waiting for him outside the government's Villa
Hammerschmidt palace next to the Rhine River. But the crowds were
far smaller than those that swarmed around the Soviet leader during
his triumphant visit to Bonn in June 1989.
   Still, some Germans exuded enthusiam for Gorbachev and his
achievements.
   ``We cannot forget we have Gorbachev to thank for unification,''
said Helmut Bittner of Leverkusen.
   ``It's in our interest that the Soviet Union remains stable. How
would anyone feel if we woke up tomorrow and a general had taken
Gorbachev's place?'' Bittner added.
   He was in a crowd of several hundred standing in near-freezing
air in front of Linz's city hall waiting for Gorbachev's wife to
arrive on her own side trip.
   The dramatic retreat of Communism and the dismantling of the
Iron Curtain the past year has radically altered relations between
the Soviet Union and Germany.
   Gorbachev relinquished Moscow's powerful role in German affairs
this summer when he agreed to a unified Germany's membership in
NATO.
   Germany's Western European allies have reacted skeptically to
the growing relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union,
remembering the devastating consequences of cooperation between
Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.
   Gorbachev sought to allay such concerns.
   ``The Soviet-German treaty is not directed at anyone. Our
agreement and cooperation are part of the ongoing construction of
the all-European house,'' Gorbachev said in a speech before the
treaty was signed.
   Now Gorbachev needs substantial foreign economic assistance to
bolster his political position and holdthe splintering Soviet
Union together.
   Kohl gave Gorbachev a boost saying he wanted ``the reform policy
of the Soviet Union that is linked with the name Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to be successful.''
   The German leader pledged further aid in his dinner speech. ``In
view of the painful but unavoidable transition, we are prepared
with words and deed to help further,'' Kohl said without announcing
specifics.
   Gorbachev directly appealed for aid in his speech. ``From you
(Germans), we would like courage, generosity ... and a healthy
readiness for risk.''
   The non-aggression treaty, the major agreement, makes Germany
the Soviet Union's largest trading partner within the European
Economic Community.
   The Soviet Union already has received a commitment of $19.5
billion this year from the German government and German banks. But
private investors are reluctant to invest as political instability
mounts in the Soviet Union.
   Germany is trying to cope with the presence of about 600,000
Soviet soldiers and their families still stationed on former East
German territory. Despite the unrest at home, Gorbachev was all
smiles when he emerged from his Ilyushin 62 at Cologne-Bonn airport
and was greeted by a 27-member German military honor guard.
   He was met by German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
and later met with Weizsaecker at the government's palace.
   Gorbachev is to visit Kohl's home state of Rhineland-Palatinate
on Saturday before returning to Moscow.

<HEAD>France Remembers de Gaulle's Death 20 Years Ago</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France commemorated the 20th anniversary of Charles
de Gaulle's death Friday with a respect and affection that eluded
the former war hero and president in his final years.
   Throughout the country, religious services, exhibitions,
symposiums, television programs and plays paid tribute to de Gaulle
as leader of French resistance to Nazi occupation and founder of
the current constitutional system with its strong president.
   In contrast to his sometimes tempestuous presidency from 1959 to
1969, De Gaulle now is admired by Frenchmen of all political
persuasions.
   A poll published Thursday in the newspaper Le Monde said 84
percent of the respondents believe de Gaulle's record in office was
``positive.''
   The near-universal admiration contrasts with the general's last
years, when students and workers rioted in the streets.
   De Gaulle's unpopularity culminated in a humiliating defeat at
the polls in 1969 and drove him from the presidency.
   Nineteen months later, on Nov. 9, 1970, while playing solitaire
at his home in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, de Gaulle suffered a
ruptured aneurism and died.
   The following afternoon his son, Philippe, went on television to
announce, ``General de Gaulle is dead, France is a widow.''
   Only his family, close wartime colleagues and villagers attended
his funeral on Nov. 12, while dozens of heads of state attended
ceremonies at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.
   Today, it is hard to find de Gaulle bashers. One exception is
``Recours-France,'' (Help-France) an organization of former French
residents of North Africa, many of whom lost everything when France
embarked on decolonization.
   ``For the French from Algeria ... he will forever be regarded as
the man who betrayed, mislead and abandoned us, without ever
pronouncing a single word of compassion for our tragic exodus,''
the organization said in a statement Friday.
   At the start of the Algerian revolution, de Gaulle pledged to
maintain French rule. He later granted independence to end the
bloodshed.
   Many ardent leftists have become de Gaulle admirers. Regis
Debray, a former adviser to Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, described de Gaulle as ``the last great man of the 19th
century and the first great man of the 21st.''
   In a new book, ``A Demain de Gaulle,'' (Tomorrow, de Gaulle)
Debray - once a leading exponent of guerrilla warfare and a
champion of the late Che Guevara - paid homage to the general's
traditionalist values.
   Mitterrand himself paid tribute Friday, sending his army chief
to lay a wreath at de Gaulle's tomb in Colombey-les-deux-Eglises.
   Exhibitions and documentaries abound, including one on De
Gaulle's manipulation of the media for political purposes. Alain
Peyrefitte, De Gaulle's information minister, has said De Gaulle
himself edited television newscasts and used the media ``as an
instrument of power.''
   This month also marks the first time De Gaulle's life and
achievements have been presented in fiction.
   Based on a forgotten scenario by William Faulkner, one of de
Gaulle's most fervent admirers, director Denys Granier-Deferre has
made a TV movie recounting the war years.
   A lesser-known side of de Gaulle is depicted in ``Villa Luco,''
a play about de Gaulle's secret visit to elderly, ailing Marshall
Philippe Petain, condemned to life imprisonment for collaborating
with the Nazis.
   This year also marks the 100th anniversary of de Gaulle's birth
and the 50th anniversary of his famed radio appeal from London for
Frenchmen to resist the Nazis.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Palestine Liberation Organization on
Friday showed the Security Council a dramatic videotape of the
violence on Temple Mount last month when at least 20 Palestinians
were killed by Israeli gunfire.
   The grainy film showed Palestinians fleeing Israeli gunfire on
the eastern side of the plateau near the Al Aksa Mosque. The
15-minute tape was punctuated by gunfire, smoke and screams. Some
of the 15 council members appeared to grimace at the events.
   M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, the PLO representative to the United
Nations, told the council the tape ``shows premeditated Israeli
determination to cause the largest possible number of dead and
wounded among Palestinian civilians.''
   The PLO showed the tape to support its call for the Security
Council to deploy U.N. military observers to protect Palestinians
in the Israeli-occupied territories and in East Jerusalem.
   Israel has rejected the demand, saying the presence of a U.N.
observer group in the occupied lands would violate its sovereignty.
   Al-Kidwa said the tape was taken by ``a non-Palestinian neutral
person ... a Westerner who happened to be in Jerusalem.'' The
photographer was not identified.
   Al-Kidwa said the film was shot from the Mount of Olives facing
east and did not support Israeli charges that the violence was
provoked by Palestinians throwing stones at Jews praying at the
Western Wall. He said it also repudiated Israeli charges that the
violence had been incited by bellicose calls by Moslems over
loudspeakers.
   The PLO provided what it said were translations from Arabic of
appeals made from the mosque, appealing to Israeli forces to stop
firing and to allow amublances, doctors and nurses to tend to the
injured.
   ``Restrain yourselves, rise to your responsibility if you have
any sense of reason,'' said one cleric in a mosque.
   Later, Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told reporters the tape
was damaging and undermined Israel's argument that the violence had
been provoked by Palestinians throwing stones at Jewish worshipers.
   ``One element was very vivid, that there was no planning in the
movements of the Palestinians. They were running in all directions
and that was not some kind of planned attack on the Israelis.
   ``And of course the sound, the sound of so many shots fired.
That was absolutely unnecessary.''
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering and the Israeli envoy had no
comment.
   Al-Kidwa said he hoped the tape would lead to ``further
concentration ... (on) the means and measure to provide protection
to the Palestinian people.''
   The violence showed ``barbarism of police and army personnel
against our people which cannot be in self-defense,'' the
Palestinian envoy said.
   The Security Council previously has been the scene of dramatic
pesentations.
   In 1989, Panama presented videotape it claimed showed U.S.
preparations for an attack. Earlier, the United States showed
photographs of what it said were heavily armed Libyan planes that
were attacked by U.S. warplanes in 1988.
   In September 1983, the Soviet Union displayed a videotape of the
pilot and control tower conversations before the shoot-down of a
Korean airliner that strayed into Soviet airspace.
   Friday's meeting was a continuation of a session that began
Wednesday to discuss the secretary-general's report on the need to
protect Palestinians in the territories captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
   The report did not recommend stationing U.N. observers or
expanding U.N. observers or other staff in the area.
   The council is expected to continue debating the issue for
several days.
   The United States is expected to veto any resolution that calls
for sending observers to the territories. However, another possible
resolution, this one calling for a meeting of parties to the Fourth
Geneva Convention, could be accepted by the United States.
   The convention calls for humanitarian treatment of civilians in
time of war. Israel is a signatory, but says the provisions do not
apply to the occupied territories.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High-definition television, a new generation of TV
with clearer, wider images, hit the Japanese market this week,
years ahead of its scheduled release in other nations.
   Most major Japanese electronics makers introduced new consumer
HDTV products, including televisions, videocassette recorders and
adaptors that allow HDTV broadcasts to be seen on present TV sets.
   The new TV sets are at least 10 times as expensive as current
models, however.
   Sony's 36-inch HDTV monitor, one of the cheaper models, goes for
the equvalent of $17,700. The 32-inch Toshiba model is priced at
$30,700.
   ``In five years, we hope to bring that down to about 1 million
yen ($7,700),'' said Hideji Matsuda of Toshiba's new media
division.
   HDTV offers extremely detailed images, digital sound and wider,
cinema-style screen proportions. Until now the equipment was aimed
at a small number of professionals and was large, heavy, and
expensive.
   HDTV adaptors, for example, weighed as much as 209 pounds and
filled a small cabinet. But new models displayed this week by many
companies weigh as little as 13 pounds and are the size of a large
cable TV adaptor.
   In Europe, companies have developed a competing HDTV system that
is not expected to be brought to market until 1992.
   In the United States, government officials are still debating
what technical standards to set for HDTV and how it should be
broadcast.
   Unlike Japan, where HDTV signals are broadcast directly from a
satellite to viewers' homes, the U.S. Federal Communications
Commission is exploring a ``simulcast'' system in which current
land-based television stations would broadcast normal programs on
their present channels and HDTV information on separate channels.
   Japan Broadcasting Corp., the public television network,
currently broadcasts one hour of HDTV satellite programming a day.
Full-time broadcasting is scheduled to start in early 1992.
   Although Japan's HDTV system is not compatibile with current
equipment, with the new adaptors, anyone with a regular television
will be able to tune in HDTV programs, although with regular
picture quality.
   HDTV monitors announced by Sony, Matsushita, NEC, Toshiba and
other companies can receive regular Japanese TV broadcasts.

   Qian arrived from Saudi Arabia at Marka Airport in Amman, where

   Spending cuts, the sale of city assets and
$125 million in new taxes are needed to avoid a virtual shutdown of
city government and to raise its rock-bottom bond rating, state and
local Democratic leaders said Friday.
   The plan - announced by Mayor W. Wilson Goode, state House
Speaker Robert W. O'Donnell and other officials - also would set up
an independent control board whose authority would be triggered if
the city failed to balance future budgets.
   ``The plan represents the critical first step for the city's
fiscal recovery,'' Goode said. ``As a esult of this coming
together of leadership, we now have the elements necessary to solve
our problems.''
   No City Council members or Republicans joined in the
announcement, which left many details sketchy.
   Other political leaders and bond-rating agencies gave the plan
mixed reviews.
   Gov. Robert P. Casey in Harrisburg called the plan ``an
important first step.'' He pledged full support of a recommendation
for an immediate sale of temporary loan notes to avert a cash
crisis.
   ``It also seems clear that the other recommendations made today
do not enjoy the same broad consensus as the note sale,'' Casey
added. ``I encourage all participants to continue their discussions
with elected officials of both parties in a further effort to
narrow differences and arrive at consensus.''
   House Minority Leader Matthew Ryan, a Republican from suburban
Delaware County, scoffed at such provisions in the plan as a $50
million increase in state aid.
   The plan was drafted behind closed doors in the last two months
by Democratic state and city officials after Wall Street snubbed
the city's attempt to float $375 million in temporary loan notes.
   The failed note issue resulted in the severe cash crunch that
would deplete city coffers during December if nothing is done.
   The Democrats urged a three-pronged attack:
   - The city would issue $250 million to $300 million in temporary
loan notes with backing from Merrill Lynch, local banks, the state
treasury and the city's pension fund. The money would allow the
city to continue operating and be repaid with tax receipts due in
the spring.
   - It would eliminate a $229 million deficit, expected by July 1,
by raising $140 million through deficit financing bonds and $90
million by selling city-owned assets, which were not specified.
   - The city's budget would erase a projected $279 million deficit
for fiscal 1992 through new taxes, higher state and federal aid and
lower court costs.
   The officials urged approval of a 1 percent sales tax they said
would raise $100 million, an unspecified $25 million tax and $9
million from mandatory withholding of the existing city wage tax
for city residents who work in the suburbs.
   The officials said they had backing from three Philadelphia
congressmen for a $33 million increase in federal aid. Cuts of $45
million would come through unspecified mayoral actions and $16
million would come through improved efficiency in the Philadelphia
courts, they said.
   Bond-rating agencies have lowered the city's debt to junk-bond
status, the lowest among major U.S. cities. The agencies have urged
city and state leaders to cooperate to find permanent solutions.
   Hyman C. Grossman, managing director at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
said the plan needed Republican backing to clear the GOP-controlled
state Senate.
   ``Without that, there's nothing to comment on,'' he said.
   Colleen Woodell, a vice president at Fitch Investors Service,
said the talks had been encouraging, but may have fallen short.
   ``Dollarwise, I'm not sure it does what they need to have
done,'' she said. ``I would need to be convinced.''
   City Council passed a precariously balanced $2.1 billion general
fund budget May 31 for the fiscal year that began July 1. By
September, a $206.4 million deficit was projected because several
assumptions had turned sour.
   Major factors included sluggish tax receipts, inaction by state
legislators on city-passed tax measures and arbitration-awarded
police and firefighter pay increases.

   Friends and doctors said Friday they were
worried that tabloid television and international exposure
surrounding the sexual assault of a young woman with 46
personalities will lead to exploitation of the victim.
   ``My concern is she may very well be exploited by everybody as
she has been before,'' said Dr. Inam Haque, a psychiatrist at
Winnebago County Mental Health Clinic who has treated the woman
since 1986.
   The 27-year-old woman, whose name has been withheld by the media
to protect her identity as a rape victim, told the Oshkosh
Northwestern she was elated by Thursday's verdict.
   ``We did it,'' she said. ``Anybody like us, myself and the
insiders (her other personalities) will be able to get protection
now.''
   A Winnebago County jury on Thursday convicted Mark A. Peterson,
29, of Oshkosh of second-degree sexual assault. He faces up to 10
years in prison when he is sentenced next month.
   The jury found the unemployed grocery store bagger, who is
married, knew the woman was mentally ill and manipulated one of her
personalities - a naive 20-year-old woman who didn't know what
intercourse was - to have sex with him two days after he met her.
   Wisconsin law forbids sexual contact with mentally ill people
who can't understand the consequences of their actions.
   The victim said her real self only learned of the June 11
assault because a 6-year-old personality was ``peeking.''
   Peterson maintained after the verdict he did not know the woman
was mentally ill and was the victim of an overzealous prosecutor.
He promised to appeal.
   The woman's testimony, which often involved her closing her eyes
and bowing her head as she switched personalities, dramatized a
rare psychiatric diagnosis called multiple personality disorder.
   Ruth Reeves, a neighbor and friend, said the woman would retain
a lawyer to help her handle the publicity and requests for
interviews. ``It appears that everybody wants a piece of the
action,'' she said.
   The television show ``Inside Edition'' announced Friday it plans
to air an interview with the woman next week, showing footage of
the woman switching personalities.
   Inside Edition reporter Janet Tamaro said the show decided to
use the interview after consulting with the woman, her mother, Mrs.
Reeves and counselors about the consequences of revealing her
identity.
   ``We were willing to do it any way all of them were willing to
do it - any way they wanted,'' Ms. Tamaro said. ``We really left it
up to them to decide.''
   District Attorney Joe Paulus, who prosecuted the case, said he
worries the woman may be exploited. He said he had nothing to do
with arranging her interviews with tabloid televisions shows.
   ``She still functions in the community. She is capable of making
everyday decisions on her own. She has got to make her own
decisions in life,'' he said.
   The illness often results from childhood abuse that forces the
sufferer to create multiple personalities to avoid confronting
reality, experts say.
   In an interview with the Appleton Post-Crescent, the woman said
she held no grudges against people who doubt her mental illness. At
one point this year, she estimated she had 86 personalities, but
many have merged together, she said.
   The woman, born in South Korea, said she believes her father was
an American, probably a GI. She was taken to an orphanage shortly
after birth.
   ``I had no maternal or paternal care of any kind,'' she told the
paper. ``I was not touched or picked up, except to be changed or
fed. I was a very angry, lonely, sad baby.''
   After eight months, she was adopted by parents who picked her
out of a catalog, she said. Her adoptive father physically abused
her, she said. He was ill ``and couldn't help it.''
   The woman said the multiple personalities began when she was
still an orphan in South Korea.

   President Guillermo Endara on Friday said
that journalists wanted to be treated like ``sacred cows,'' and
several newspapers excised his name from stories in a dispute over
press laws.
   Journalists are demanding an end to the strict laws that were
carried over from the regime of former dictator Manuel Antonio
Noriega, who was overthrown by the U.S. invasion in December.
   The government has used the laws to issue summons to reporters
who attended an opposition news conference and to arrest on charges
of criminal slander a columnist who had criticized Endara.
   Organizers of a protest march on Thursday vowed to impose ``the
law of ice'' and freeze coverage of the president. Several
newspapers and radio stations referred to Endara on Friday only as
``the president of the republic,'' without mentioning his name.
   Endara, speaking to reporters before leaving Friday to attend
the enthronement of Emperor Akihito in Japan, said he was shocked
by the behavior of reporters who confronted him after Thursday's
march.
   Endara said he had refused to receive the demonstrators in his
office because ``they wanted to enter just because they were
reporters, as if they were the sacred cows of this republic, and
they aren't.''
   ``That was an uproar of the worst sort ... the things they
shouted at me were really outrageous. I could not receive or talk
to any person who shouts in that way,'' he said.
   Endara's press secretary, Rene Hernandez said ``the president's
policy is to defend freedom of expression,'' but he said
``criticism should not be confused with calumny.''
   He said if reporters want the laws changed, they should petition
the legislature.

   U.S. troops stationed in the
Saudi desert say President Bush is right to give Operation Desert
Shield more muscle for a possible attack on Iraq.
   ``Militarily speaking, he's absolutely right,'' Air Force Capt.
Patrick Ryan, 28, of New Orleans said Friday as he waited for a
flight at an air base in eastern Saudi Arabia.
   Bush on Thursday ordered more than 150,000 additional troops to
the Persian Gulf to join the 230,000 U.S. military personnel in the
region. Allies from 26 countries have sent another 100,000 soldiers
to join the multinational force deployed after Iraq seized Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   ``I don't think we have to worry much about the Iraqis launching
an offensive anymore,'' said Ryan, a fighter pilot. ``The big thing
right now is how to get those guys out of Kuwait, and to launch an
offensive it's going to take quite a lot of firepower.''
   Like many servicemen here, Ryan said he hoped Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein would pull his troops out of Kuwait, but that
U.S.-led forces must be prepared if he refuses.
   The president said he wanted the allied forces to have an
``adequate offensive military option'' should global sanctions fail
to convince Saddam to withdraw. Iraq has deployed an estimated
430,000 troops in Kuwait and southern Iraq since the invasion.
   A ranking U.S. military official in Saudi Arabia, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said: ``If there was a doubt in Saddam
Hussein's mind about U.S. resolve to use any option required, if it
comes to that, this should pretty well clear it up.''
   Army Maj. Frank Irons, 40, of Knoxville, Tenn., a logistics
expert, said he thought more troops would limit casualties in the
event of war.
   ``I would think the more people, the more firepower we get in
here would enhance our chances if we were to go on the offensive to
do a quicker job, therefore saving a lot of people and limiting the
casualties that we would probably have,'' he said.
   News of the new mobilization was just filtering out to the
troops in the field.
   At the Army's 530th Supply and Services Battalion headquarters,
which provides logistics support for thousands of soldiers, there
was some concern in the laundry and bakery about the mobilization.
   ``The only thing I'm worried about is having to make more
bread,'' said Spec. Norman Wiemken, 22, of Polo, Ill., who was
baking some of the 3,000 loaves made daily.
   ``Just more laundry,'' Pvt. 1 Lawandra Hinton, 20, of Newport
News, Va. said with a laugh. She was sorting through some of the
12,000 pieces of clothing washed at her laundry every day.

<HEAD>Service Station Clerk Slain as Customers Fill Up Gas</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GREENFIELD, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Service station attendant Michael Hicke,
shot twice in the head, lay unnoticed for several hours while some
customers pumped free gas for themselves.
   Now police have unveiled a new twist: A friend has admitted he
shot Hicke once during an armed robbery, then shot him again to end
his misery when he began ``making funny noises and gurgling.''
   Brothers Emil Wisniewski, 18, and Anton Wisniewski, 25, were
charged Friday with first-degree intentional homicide and armed
robbery in Hicke's death.
   Police said the 18-year-old victim - who worked at a Shell gas
station in the Milwaukee suburb of Greenfield - and two suspects
had lived in the same neighborhood years ago and were friends.
   Hicke's body was discovered in the station's car wash section
about 35 yards from the gas pumps about 7 a.m. Sunday by a customer
searching for the attendant.
   The customer had pumped gasoline, looked for the clerk and found
him dead with two bullet wounds to the head, Detective Dirk
Wichgers said.
   Police believe five other customers pumped a total of about $40
in gas without paying between midnight and 7 a.m., during the hours
after Hicke was believed to have been shot, Wichgers said.
   One of the five left the money in a tray in the attendant's
booth and another returned the following day to pay, said station
owner Edward F. McMahon.
   According to a criminal complaint, the Wisniewski brothers
planned earlier to go to the gas station because ``there was a lot
of money there and the guy was supposed to have cocaine in the
trunk of his car.''
   But when the two arrived, they found Hicke was working the shift
for another employee. Investigators said the two tried to convince
Hicke to do a ``fake robbery.''
   The younger Wisniewski and Hicke went to the car wash to smoke
marijuana, while the older Wisniewski tried to break into the floor
safe in the attendant's booth, police said.
   After hearing the hammering, Hicke tried to return to the booth,
the two struggled and the younger Wisniewski shot Hicke in the
face, investigators said. Wisniewski returned shortly afterward and
shot Hicke again in the side of the head at point-blank range.
   He told police he fired the second shot ``to make sure he was
dead because ... (I) didn't want him to suffer, because he was
`making funny noises and gurgling.'''
   The homicide charge carries a mandatory penalty of life in
prison, and the armed robbery count carries a maximum of 20 years.
   McMahon, the station owner, said he was perplexed by the actions
of the customers who pumped gas without paying on the night Hicke
was shot.
   ``You'd think there would be more concern about why the person
is not there,'' McMahon said. ``That's the only human thing to
do.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Bell telephone companies should be fined
$250,000 each for accounting violations that diverted money to
other telephone companies, the Federal Communications Commission
said Friday.
   Commission officials said telephone customers were not hurt by
what the companies did.
   The FCC sent notices of apparent liability to Pacific Bell,
Southwestern Bell, New England Telephone and New York Telephone.
Companies receiving such notices are given 30 days to show why they
should not pay the fine.
   The commission also sent a letter of reprimand to the National
Exchange Carrier Association Inc., a telephone-company operated
entity that collects and distributes the ``access charges'' that
long-distance companies pay local telephone companies to connect
with the local networks.
   The association, based in Whippany, N.J., distributes access
charge revenues to the local companies based on revenue and cost
information reported by these companies, the FCC said.
   ``This letter concluded that certain NECA directors apparently
failed to ensure the accuracy of the data reported to NECA and that
the NECA board of directors, as a whole, apparently did not display
proper vigilance,'' the FCC said.
   The apparent violations were discovered during an audit of the
association.
   The Bell companies, as regulated monopolies, are allowed to earn
only a fixed percentage above the costs of their investments,
currently about 12 percent. After all participating companies
collect their expenses from the common line pool, they claim
profits from what's left over. The Bell companies make claims
according to their permitted rates of return; what's left over is
available for the smaller companies.
   Richard Firestone, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau,
said the Bell companies deliberately reduced their expense claims
in order to increase the size of the profit pool, thus increasing
the profits available to the smaller companies and boosting their
rates of return on the investments concerned.
   Just why the Bell companies would want to boost the rates of
return for other companies by understating their own expenses was
not clear, and the amount of money involved was not stated. The
commission did not immediately release the audit report on which
its action was based.
   Firestone would not speculate on the Bell companies' motives.
But he emphasized that telephone customers did not lose any money
as a result of the companies' actions.
   The issue for the FCC, Firestone said, was that the companies'
reporting of their earnings and expenses must be credible.
   Commissioner Andrew C. Barrett said in an accompanying statement
that the association board ``blatantly subverted the commission's
processes and penalties'' even though the Bell companies appeared
to have ``given money away.''
   Barrett said the board ``intended to manipulate the FCC's
processes to achieve unstated and potentially unlawful ends'' and
its ``intention to deceive commission staff to achieve political or
other goals cannot go unpunished.''
   Lou Saviano, spokesman for Pacific Telephone in San Francisco,
said, ``we think they're just over-reacting to what is essentially
an honest mistake and we think it would be grossly unfair for the
FCC to penalize us.''
   ``We acted on the basis of the best information that was
available to us with the intent of being fair. When they advised us
we made a mistake we fixed it ... voluntarily gave the money
back,'' he said.
   Nynex spokesman Peter Goodale, reached in New York, said the
companies had ``cooperated with NECA and the FCC in connection with
the audit ... but we're unaware of any improprieties that the FCC
believes it may have found.''
   The FCC also required the association to have an independent
auditor report to the commission within 180 days on other
adjustments phone companies reported during 1988 and 1989, and on
safeguards to prevent future problems.

   A young man who had just arrived on a

burst in his stomach, hospital officials said Friday.
   The unidentified man died last week after arriving from Nairobi,
Kenya, the officials said.
   They said several other condoms containing cocaine were found in
the man's stomach during an autopsy.
   He was traveling on a Nigerian passport, but airport officials
found he was carrying four other passports in his jacket.
   Traffickers sometimes hide illegal drugs in condoms in their
bodies to conceal it from authorities.

   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on Friday
swore in an 18-member Cabinet of veteran bureaucrats and announced
that he will retain the foreign and finance ministers of the
caretaker government.
   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will likely keep the defense
portfolio, as did his predecessors. More than half of Pakistan's
$10 billion budget goes to the military.
   Sharif may expand his Cabinet later, but officials say it will
be much smaller than the record 58-member Cabinet of ousted Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, a political survivor, will remain as
foreign minister. He held the post in the Bhutto government and in
the army-backed caretaker government that replaced her
administration.
   Sartaj Aziz will stay on as finance minister, a post he held in
the caretaker government.
   The president dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government in
August, saying corruption, political ineptitude and mismanagement
had paralyzed Parliament.
   A right-wing coalition known as the Islamic Democratic Alliance
swept parliamentary elections on Oct. 24 and provincial elections
three days later. Ms. Bhutto charged widespread vote tampering, an
accusation her opponents and most international observers dismiss.
   Sharif, leader of the alliance and architect of Ms. Bhutto's
stunning loss, was sworn in on Wednesday as prime minister of
Pakistan's fifth freely elected Parliament in 43 years.
   Ishaq Khan leaves Saturday for Japan to attend the enthronement
of Emperor Akihito. He is expected to meet with Vice President Dan
Quayle in Tokyo to discuss a stalled $573 million U.S. aid package.

   More than 100 turtles at the
world's only known sea turtle farm have died in the past two months
from a mysterious disease that has the farm's director baffled.
   Since late September, more than a dozen breeding turtles and
more than 100 infant turtles on this Caribbean island have died
from the illness, said Dr. James Wood, director of the
government-owned Cayman Turtle Farm.
   He said he suspects a virus because the turtles have not
responded to antibiotics.
   Samples of turtle tissue were sent to the University of Florida
School of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville for study, Wood said.
   The farm raises turtles for export to such countries as Japan,
Singapore and the Philippines, where turtle meat is considered a
delicacy.

   Iraq's official newspaper said Friday that Baghdad's foreign
minister and a former French official held secret talks that led to
the release of more than 300 French hostages from Iraq. France
denied it sanctioned the talks.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt flew from Baghdad to
Frankfurt Friday aboard a German jetliner carrying 174 Western
captives to freedom. Brandt negotiated the release of the hostages,
who included three Americans.
   One of the Americans was Miles Hoffman, 33, of Columbus, Ga.,
shot in the arm Sept. 5 by Iraqi forces in Kuwait. Hoffman was
whisked off the plane by authorities and taken to the U.S Air Force
Regional Hospital in Wiesbaden, German, for treatment.
   Earlier, after he was given his boarding documents at Baghdad's
airport, Hoffman told TV cameras, ``Good riddance.''
   A second American, Don Swanke, 66, of Westlake Village, Calif.,
also was taken to the Wiesbaden hospital, 25 miles outside
Frankfurt, for a precautionary checkup, said Air Force Capt. Tom
Gilroy. Swanke lost 33 pounds in captivity.
   The airport rang out with the cheers of the hundreds on hand for
the arrival as the German jetliner touched down.
   Relatives who hadn't seen each other since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2 wept and embraced as they emerged from the plane.
Some held signs reading, ``Thank you, Mr. Brandt.''
   Brandt told a news conference before leaving Baghdad that he was
carrying proposals for settling the 3-month-old Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Western officials have charged that independent efforts by
governments and former leaders to win release of their nationals
risks dividing the world alliance against Iraq, which invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But speaking in Bonn, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Friday said no one can ``drive a wedge'' into the international
solidarity.
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Friday that
American military forces in the gulf will reach up to 430,000
within weeks - 200,000 more than are now deployed.
   Cheney said the additional troops would give U.S.-allied forces
the offensive military option to drive Iraqi troops from the
oil-rich emirate, which it invaded in a dispute over land, oil and
money.
   Iraq's Al-Jumhouriya newspaper reported, meanwhile, that Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and former French Foreign Minister
Claude Cheysson met for secret talks endorsed by France.
   The daily did not say when or where the meeting between Aziz and
Cheysson took place. Arab sources said the talks, set up by the
Palestine Liberation Organization, took place in Tunis late last
month, one week before Saddam said French nationals were free to
go.
   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas denied that Cheysson or
anyone else had a mandate to negotiate the release of hostages,
freed by Saddam in late October. France has repeatedly said it made
no deal with Iraq.
   The French government did not, however, deny that the talks took
place. And there was no indication whether they involved a
diplomatic effort to seek a peaceful solution to the 3-month-old
gulf crisis.
   France has made no formal public pledge regarding the
circumstances under which it would fight Iraq, saying such
decisions should be made by the U.N. Security Council.
   The release of the French nationals was interpreted by many
Western officials as an effort by Iraq to divide opposition to its
occupation of Kuwait.
   But Gorbachev, during a news conference in Bonn, said: ``For the
first time in history we have acted together in so critical a
situation.''
   ``Let no one reckon on driving a wedge into that unity,'' he
said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III met Friday with British
officials in London, on a weeklong tour of Middle Eastern and
European nations to gather support for possible military action
against Iraq.
   Later, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said London and
Washington stood ``absolutely together'' on the gulf crisis. Baker
was to meet in Paris with French officials on Saturday.
   In Moscow, the previous stop on Baker's tour, a senior U.S.
official said Friday that the moderate Arab forces would fight
alongside U.S. troops to liberate Kuwait, but he was uncertain that
France would go along.
   ``I don't know where the French would be,'' the official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Several former leaders - including Edward Heath of Britain,
Yasuhiro Nakasone of Japan, and most recently Brandt - have
negotiated freedom for some of the hundreds of hostages in Iraq and
Kuwait.
   No reason was given for the release of the Americans, which
included Swanke's wife Brenda, among the other captives. About
1,000 Americans are still held.
   The three had been held among hundreds of others as human
shields at strategic Iraqi sites to deter attack by the
multinational forces stationed in the gulf region.
   Hoffman, a financial analyst with the Kuwaiti government at the
time of the invasion, was shot in the left arm by Iraqi troops who
tried to force their way into his apartment in Kuwait City.
   There were reports that gangrene developed from the wound, and
the U.S. Embassy had placed him on its list of release requests
twice before. Hoffman's arm was in a cast and he appeared in pain.
   Patience with Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait and its holding of
Western hostages appeared to be growing thin. The U.N. trade
embargo on Iraq has not yet pushed Iraq into any retreat from the
emirate.
   On Thursday, the Soviet Union said for the first time it would
not rule out military action as a last resort and President Bush
announced there would be new troop deployments, without offering
any figures.
   Once the added forces are in place, America will have more
troops in the gulf region than it had in Europe during the Cold
War. About one-third of the Army's worldwide force will be in the
Saudi desert.
   ``The additional increment will give us the capacity to
undertake offensive action should that become necessary,'' Cheney
said Friday.
   At the United Nations, an attempt by Iraq to introduce a General
Assembly resolution criticizing the U.S. military buildup in the
gulf drew a stinging rebuke Friday when an assembly committee
unanimously refused to consider it.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering called the Iraqi attempt to
introduce a resolution ``ill-founded, tendentious and mendacious.''

<HEAD>Attorney for White Killer Says He'll Seek Amnesty for Client</HEAD>

   A right-wing radical who shot to
death six blacks will seek his release under a government amnesty
program, his lawyer said Friday.
   Wim Cornelius said his client, Barend Strydom, qualified because
he was acting on instructions from an extreme right-wing group when
he mowed down the blacks in downtown Pretoria on Nov. 15, 1988.
   Cornelius is serving a death sentence.
   The government said Nov. 1 it would consider amnesty for
political prisoners under an agreement with the African National
Congress. It said certain criteria would be considered in each
case, such as whether the act was committed under orders from a
political organization.
   The agreement was primarily aimed at ANC members and
sympathizers imprisoned for crimes related to the anti-apartheid
struggle.
   Strydom, a former police officer, claimed he was acting on
behalf of a shadowy group called the White Wolves.

   A U.S. Army soldier taking part
in Operation Desert Shield has been found dead, apparently of
natural causes, in a shower, military officials said Friday.
   The soldier was identified as Sgt. James Wilcher, 25, by
officials at Fort Bliss, Texas, where he had been stationed
earlier. They said he was found dead Thursday after dinner.
   A preliminary investigation showed no evidence of foul play, the
Pentagon said.
   ``It is suspected that he died of natural causes. However, the
exact cause of death is not known at this time. Medical help was
immediately available and all attempts to revive him were
unsuccessful,'' the Fort Bliss news release stated.
   The soldier was assigned to the 118th Ordnance Detachment of the
11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, which was sent to Saudi Arabia
from Fort Bliss in El Paso.
   Forty-five U.S. servicemen have died during the Saudi operation
to counter Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 43 in accidents, one
by suicide and Thursday's fatality.

<HEAD>Boschwitz Apologizes For Letter Suggesting Wellstone Wasn't A Good
Jew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz apologized Friday for
a letter sent to some Minnesota Jews on behalf of his unsuccessful
re-election campaign suggesting his challenger was not a good Jew.
   ``I deeply regret having allowed the letter to be written and
accept full responsibility for it,'' said Boschwitz, who is Jewish.
   Paul Wellstone, who upset the Republican senator in Tuesday's
election, said he appreciated Boschwitz's remarks and accepted his
apology.
   ``I think it should be the final word,'' said the senator-elect,
who is also Jewish.
   The letter, written by two of Boschwitz's Jewish supporters and
signed by them and 70 others, was printed on Boschwitz campaign
stationery and mailed at campaign expense Nov. 1.
   ``Wellstone has no connection with the Jewish community or our
communal life,'' the letter said. ``His children were brought up as
non-Jews.''
   The letter noted that Wellstone served as co-chairman of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Minnesota, and
said, ``Jesse Jackson has embraced, literally and figuratively,
Yasser Arafat, and has never repudiated that embrace.''
   Moreover, Wellstone never disassociated himself from any of
Jackson's policies, the letter said.
   The letter angered Wellstone's Jewish supporters, some of whom
described it as an attempt to split the Jewish vote over the issue
of Israel.
   Two days before the election, Wellstone said the letter was
``completely unforgivable.''
   ``This is making an issue of the fact that we have an
interreligious marriage,'' said Wellstone, whose wife is Christian.
``This is the most sensitive issue in the Jewish community there
is.''
   Boschwitz initially stood by the letter. But on Friday, after
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported that the letter had
generated angry discussion among Jews in Israel and the United
States, the senator said he was sorry.
   ``Bringing Jews and non-Jews together has been an important
element of my public service and private life,'' Boschwitz said.
``Others will judge over time whether I have made a positive
contribution in this regard, but for the moment I simply reiterate
my apology.''
   Wellstone said Boschwitz' statement showed a ``tremendous amount
of sincerity and conviction.''
   ``His remarks are powerful,'' Wellstone said. ``It was very
hurtful to everybody in our family, but this is a wonderful
statement, and I think it's in the past.''
   Wellstone said he didn't believe the letter was the major reason
why Boschwitz lost the election, but he said, ``In the end, it was
very damaging for them.''

<TEXT>
   Unidentified assailants fired two
grenades early Saurday at the U.S. Embassy one day after American
and Philippine panels ended talks on the future of six military
bases.
   There were no injuries in the attack, which took place at 6:50
a.m. when the embassy was closed. One grenade landed in Manila Bay
behind the compound and exploded, embassy spokesman Stanley
Schrager said. The other landed in front of the chancery building
but did not explode, he said.
   There was no claim of responsibility, though the attack was
similar to one staged last December at an American residential
area. That attack, which caused no injuries and minor damage, was
blamed on Communist rebels.
   At the end of talks Friday, there were reports the bases' future
would be linked to U.S. aid to the Philippines.
   The next meeting was set for December. Spokesmen for both sides
predicted the talks would be completed by January.
   ``The discussions over the past two days were useful in widening
the areas of consensus and narrowing the areas still to be
discussed in more detail,'' U.S. spokesman Stanley Schrager told
reporters.
   Philippine spokesman Rafael Alunan said the two sides had
reached no agreements but ``succeeded in widening the areas of
consensus and narrowing the areas that still need to be threshed
out.''
   On Thursday, Alunan said the U.S. delegation agreed ``to junk
the bases agreement and start from ground zero.''
   Alunan did not elaborate. But Philippine officials have said
they want any new agreement to cover trade concessions, debt relief
and other issues.
   About 50 militant youths held a brief rally near the Central
Bank building, where the panels met, and burned an American flag
before dispersing peacefully.
   In Angeles, 50 miles north of Manila, police arrested eight
leftist students who burned an American flag a few yards from the
Clark Air Base gate.
   The talks centers on the status of Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay
Naval Base and four smaller facilities whose lease expires on Sept.
16. Most Philippine politicians have called for phasing out the
bases, although U.S. officials say they want a ``residual''
American military presence here.
   The United States currently maintains about 40,000 troops,
military dependents and Defense Department civilians at the bases,
among the largest on foreign soil. The bases and related
infrastructure provide jobs for scores of thousands of Filipinos.
   After his arrival Wednesday, U.S. special negotiator Richard
Armitage told Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus that Washington
would remove its 48 combat aircraft and 1,800 Air Force personnel
from Clark Air Base.
   Manglapus, chief Philippine negotiator, said last September the
Philippines wanted to take control of Clark when the current bases
agreement expires in September.
   Philippine officials said they were willing to negotiate the
status of the Subic Bay naval base and the other installations.
Alunan said the Philippines was sticking by its demand for
``sovereign control'' of the bases by next year.
   The six bases are technically Philippine installations but are
effectively under American control.
   Schrager told reporters Friday said the Americans wanted a
transition period to transfer the bases to full Philippine control
and that the time-frame could vary depending on the installation.
   On Thursday, he said the United States ``would like to maintain
access to some of these facilities and to maintain a small residual
American military presence in the country similar to the agreements
we have with many other countries around the world.''
   Any new agreement must be ratified by two-thirds of the
23-member Philippine Senate, where opposition to the installations
is strong.
   Opinion surveys show most Filipinos support the bases, but many
influential figures in government, academic circles and media
oppose them as an infringement on sovereignty.

<HEAD>Section of Berlin Wall Dedicated Where Churchill Warned of Iron
Curtain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FULTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westminster College, where Winston Churchill
first warned of an Iron Curtain's descent across Europe,
rededicated part of the fallen Berlin Wall on Friday as a monument
to peace and freedom.
   Former President Reagan told about 4,000 people at an outdoor
ceremony that the wall sections transplanted to Missouri stand as
proof that ``the political map of Europe has been rewritten.''
   ``The future has been redefined, even as the veil has been
lifted on a cruel and bloody past,'' Reagan said.
   Churchill's granddaughter, artist Edwina Sandys, joined together
eight sections of the wall to form the 32-foot-long sculpture. She
carved two passages in the 11-foot-high concrete in the shapes of a
man and a woman so ``people can pass through freely.''
   Reagan led dignitaries in walking through the openings in the
wall, which is a stark gray on the side that once faced east. They
emerged on the old west side, adorned with bright graffiti. The
word ``Unwahr,'' German for ``untruth,'' appears frequently on the
wall, which has been placed near a bronze statue of Churchill.
   Ms. Sandys, whose sculptures have been displayed in Europe and
at the United Nations, said she was accustomed to working in
marble.
   ``Thirty-two feet of concrete created quite a challenge ...
unyielding slabs of concrete, steeped as they are in heroism and
history,'' she told the audience.
   The sculpture was dedicated on the one-year anniversary of the
fall of the wall, and more than three years after Reagan, during a
Berlin visit, called on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ``tear
down this wall.''
   Churchill first invoked the image of an Iron Curtain to describe
growing Soviet influence during a speech at Westminster on March 5,
1946.
   ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron
Curtain has descended across the Continent,'' he said.
   ``Today we come full circle from those anxious times,'' Reagan
said. ``Out of one man's speech was born a new Western resolve.''
   Some of those attending the ceremony Friday had been on hand for
Churchill's speech 44 years earlier.
   Raymond Miller of Fulton drove the town's mayor in the parade
for Churchill and said it was one of the highlights of his 64
years.
   ``I'm real thrilled about being part of history he predicted
back in 1946,'' Miller said.

<HEAD>Nixon Library: Watergate Tapes Take Back Seat to Gowns, Paintings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YORBA LINDA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new Nixon presidential library
said Friday it is delaying two Watergate tape exhibits so it can
display Dwight Eisenhower paintings and first lady gowns.
   The decision was strictly a financial one, said library director
John Taylor, who denied that the move represents a reluctance to
feature the scandal that forced Richard M. Nixon's 1974 resignation
as president.
   ``We have a concise and compelling Watergate story. I feel
confident it is all right to transfer my attentions elsewhere,''
Taylor said.
   Some scholars questioned the library's postponement of exhibits
featuring two tape recordings from March 1973.
   ``They don't want to play it. The simplest explanation will
suffice. Things are no different than since 1972 - coverup is the
order of the day,'' said Stanley Kutler, a University of Wisconsin
professor and author of the recently published ``The Wars of
Watergate: The Last Crisis of Richard Nixon.''
   Taylor said the library's section on Watergate already includes
a crucial June 23, 1972, tape recording of a conversation between
Nixon and his aides. The tape is edited and includes accompanying
narration.
   On the tape, Nixon agrees to ask the CIA to block an
investigation by the FBI into the break-in at the Democratic
National Committee headquarters in the Watergate hotel-office
complex.
   ``The portions of the June 23 tape on exhibit are the most
decisive and critical portions,'' Taylor said. ``Some observers
might say they are the most clear signs of wrongdoing.''
   Taylor called the charge of a coverup ``silly'' and noted that
the tapes are available to the public elsewhere.
   He also said the library - the nation's only fully privately
funded presidential library - has an obligation to paint a broader
picture of Nixon's life and to entertain visitors as well.
   ``We are an attraction, one that is involved with describing a
career that spans and continues to span almost a half of a
century,'' including Nixon's terms as vice president under
President Eisenhower, Taylor said.
   A showing of 23 of Eisenhower's oil paintings is ``an integral
part of the story,'' Taylor said. He also said improving the
display of gowns worn by Nixon's wife, Pat, is justifiable.
   ``Gown and textile displays of this nature are very popular at
the Smithsonian (the Washington museum) and at other presidential
exhibits,'' he said.
   He said he ultimately intends to exhibit the two Watergate
tapes, at a cost of $15,000 to $20,000, with the same kind of
narration and editing used to put the June 23 tape in a historical
context.
   ``A lot of people saying that it is a coverup are really saying
that the Nixon library should not have the opportunity to place
Nixon documents in a context he feels is accurate,'' Taylor said.
   On one of the tapes, from March 21, 1973, White House counsel
John Dean said: ``We have a cancer within, close to the presidency,
that is growing.'' On the March 22 tape, Nixon said he wanted his
aides to ``stonewall it, plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up. ...
''
   The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, about
30 miles southeast of Los Angeles, opened in July with festivities
attended by Nixon, President Bush and others.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Urge Restraint in Iraq Showdown, Use `Just War'
Criteria</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Roman Catholic bishops gave qualified
support to U.S. actions in the Middle East, but said the United
States should maintain non-violent pressure on Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   The bishops' position was submitted to Secretary of State James
Baker III in a letter sent Wednesday by Los Angeles Archbishop
Roger Mahony, chairman of the International Policy Committee of the
U.S. Catholic Conference.
   In the letter, the archbishop cited so-called ``just war''
criteria outlined in the U.S. bishops' Pastoral Letter on War and
Peace released in May 1983.
   The criteria make war a last-resort action taken only after
exhausting peaceful means, and weighing possible losses against the
values at stake and the probability of success.
   ``A resort to war in violation of these criteria would
jeopardize many lives, raise serious moral questions and undermine
the international solidarity against Iraq,'' Mahony wrote.
   ``My concern is that the pressure to use military force may grow
as the pursuit of non-violent options almost inevitably become more
difficult, complex and slow,'' the letter said.
   The Catholic Conference, composed of 390 bishops, earlier said
it opposed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and supported United
Nations sanctions.
   Mahony urged continued cooperation between the United States,
the Soviet Union, Arab states and other nations.

   Former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt arrived here Friday from Baghdad with three Americans and
171 other Westerners whose freedom he sought in talks with Iraqi
strongman Saddam Hussein.
   One of the Americans, Miles Hoffman, 33, of Columbus, Ga., shot
in the arm Sept. 5 by Iraqi forces in Kuwait, was immediately taken
off the plane and taken to the U.S. Air Force Regional Hospital in
Wiesbaden, Germany, for a checkup, Air Force spokesman Capt. Tom
Gilroy said.
   A second American, Don Swanke, 66, of Westlake Village, Calif.,
also was taken to the U.S. hospital in Wiesbaden, 25 miles west of
Frankfurt, for a precautionary checkup, Gilroy said. Swanke lost 33
pounds during his captivity.
   The airport rang out with the cheers of the hundreds on hand for
the arrival of the former hostages as the German jetliner touched
down.
   Relatives who hadn't seen each other since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2 wept and embraced as they emerged from the plane.
Some held signs reading, ``Thank you, Mr. Brandt.'' Others departed
the plane carrying children; one woman hugged Brandt.
   ``Good riddance,'' Hoffman told TV cameras at the airplane
boarding counter in Baghdad as he clutched onto his U.S. passport
and boarding documents. His arm was in a cast and he seemed to be
in pain.
   Swanke and his wife, Brenda Swanke, were presented to reporters
by U.S. authorities.
   The captives, including 120 Germans, had been ordered freed by
Saddam after he met with Brandt.
   At least two other Americans were held back earlier when Iraqi
officials told the U.S. Embassy their papers were not in order. It
was unclear if they would be allowed to leave later.
   Also on the plane were nationals from Britain, Italy,
Switzerland, Finland, Holland, Portugal, Belgium, Norway and
Luxembourg, the German carrier Lufthansa said. Earlier reports of a
Canadian aboard could not be confirmed.
   The airline's manifest only listed nationalities, not names.
   Brandt said upon his departure that he had discussed with Saddam
efforts to achieve a durable and solid settlement for the problems
of The Middle East.
   At the Baghdad airport, Brandt told a news conference he was
carrying proposals for settling the 3-month-old gulf crisis.
   ``I need a weekend to go through my notes and put together what
I have,'' Brandt said, refusing to elaborate.
   Brandt said he would consult with European leaders next week on
the outcome of his talks with Hussein.
   He said he was impressed with Saddam, adding, ``I have reasons
to be most grateful to Saddam Hussein and the government, not only
for their hospitality, but also because there is a prospect of
peace.''
   Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz, who accompanied Brandt to the
airport, criticized Bush administration plans announced Thursday to
send another 200,000 troops to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Bush should send diplomats, not more troops, and he should
start a dialogue,'' the foreign minister said when reporters asked
him for a reaction to the U.S. move.
   ``If he wants to scare Iraq he already has enough troops. The
decision to send troops will not be helpful. It is not going to
find a solution,'' Aziz said.
   Americans are among foreign hostages held at strategic sites as
``human shields'' to deter attack by U.S.-led multinational forces
stationed in the gulf.
   Swanke, who was working as a construction engineer at Kuwait
University at the time of the invasion, ``We were worried for a
hundred days.''
   ``I was worried but I was not afraid,'' Mrs. Swanke added. She
held onto her husband's arm as they embarked on German-bound plane.
   Swanke said that on Sept. 5, ``they (Iraqi troops) kicked our
door down,'' and the couple were taken to the Regency Hotel in
Kuwait.
   From there they were taken to Baghdad, he said, ``where we
stayed in a hotel for a week.''
   He said the couple were then taken to Mosul, a town about 240
miles north of Baghdad, and kept in a house.
   After three weeks the couple were moved onto a base, ``I think
it was a missile assembly and storage area,'' Swanke said.
   The couple said they had no idea why they were chosen to be
released and credited Brandt with their final departure.
   ``They (Iraqis) wouldn't give us our passports last night. They
wouldn't give them to us today. He (Brandt) personally intervened
and got our name on the list,'' Swanke said.
   Hoffman, a financial analyst with the Kuwaiti government at the
time of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, was shot when Iraqi soldiers tried
to force their way into his Kuwait City apartment, according to
reports from Columbus.
   The bullet shattered a bone in his left forearm and he was
hospitalized for about a week, the reports said.
   Hoffman was brought to Baghdad and then moved to a strategic
site outside Baghdad. There were reports that gangrene had
developed from the wound, and the U.S. Embassy had placed him on
its list of release requests twice before.
   Hoffman's relatives, who had been working for weeks to win his
release, were overjoyed when they were told by the State Department
that he had been freed.
   ``Everything's confirmed. It's just marvelous. It's just
wonderful,'' his mother, Ann, said in Columbus.
   ``We're ecstatic,'' said Hoffman's brother, Chancellor. ``We
need to check on his arm. He needs to get to a hospital.''

<HEAD>Karpov Defends Quality of Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anatoly Karpov said Friday he believed his match
against world champion Garry Kasparov has produced better chess
than has been described in the press.
   ``I would not say the quality of the match is at a low level,''
Karpov told a news conference. ``In this match, all games were very
complicated. In all games we witnessed very sharp, acute and
interesting struggle, except for the 10th game.''
   The 10th was one of 10 games that the two Soviet players called
a draw. Each also has one victory and after a month of play they
are tied at 6 points each. The match now moves to Lyons, France,
for the final 12 games beginning Nov. 24.
   The first player to score 12{ points wins the championship and
$1.7 million of the $3 million total purse. A 12-12 tie would
enable Kasparov to retain the crown he lifted from Karpov in 1985,
but the money would be split.
   Kasparov did not appear at the news conference. The sponsor said
he did not know where the champion was or why he decided not to
attend.
   Karpov, 39, sometimes in English and sometimes through a
translator, told reporters that he thought having the championship
partly in New York ``maybe will help revive the interest in chess
in this country that had been there in 1972.''
   ``I remember the time of the chess boom in America in 1972, when
(Bobby) Fischer became world champion,'' he said.
   It was a time, he recalled, when a tournament in San Antonio
offered play at a level high enough to attract a 21-year-old
Karpov. But Fischer, feuding with the international chess
bureaucracy, never defended his title and chess interest here
waned.
   Several questioners seemed to invite Karpov to say that his
longstanding personal antagonism for Kasparov was softening and
that he could concede that the champion's influence has been good
for him and for chess.
   ``You're trying to persuade me to love Kasparov as a mother
would try to persuade a child to go to sleep,'' Karpov said.
   ``I respect him as a chess player very much. I have no other
words to express it. As concerns his personality, I have spoken
what I think about his behavior and I don't want to repeat
myself.''
   Karpov said he'd use the next two weeks to rest up and recover
from jet lag. Also, ``I think it is no secret that both Kasparov
and myself will be doing a lot of chess work.''

<HEAD>Writer John Hugh Maclennan Dead at 83</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hugh MacLennan, an award-winning novelist
considered among Canada's finest writers, died Wednesday at his
home at age 83.
   The cause of death was not immediately known.
   MacLennan is best known for his 1945 novel ``Two Solitudes,''
which became a byword for the strains between French and
English-speaking Canadians, although that was not its original
connotation.
   The son of a Nova Scotia doctor, he studied at Dalhousie
University, Oxford and Princeton. The Rhodes scholar came to
Montreal in 1935 to teach classics at Lower Canada College and
joined McGill University's English department in 1951. He retired
from McGill in 1981.
   MacLennan stopped writing in 1984 with his last novel, ``Voices
in Time.'' His first published novel, ``Barometer Rising,'' came
out in 1941, followed by ``The Precipice,' ``The Watch That Ends
the Night'' and ``Return of the Sphinx.''
   MacLennan was awarded Canada's Governor-General award three
times for fiction and twice for nonfiction - more than any other
writer.
   Jack McClelland, former head of the McClelland and Stewart
publishing firm in Toronto, said MacLennan was the most important
novelist in Canada.
   ``He was a stylist. He had great depth of understanding of our
country as a whole. He was, as an individual, thoughtful, with an

   The family of Miles Hoffman, who was shot
in the arm by Iraqi troops in Kuwait and held at a chemical plant
near Baghdad, said Friday they were elated that the 33-year-old
financial analyst has been freed.
   ``The first order of business will be to take care of that
arm,'' said Hoffman's brother, Chancellor. ``He needs to get to the
hospital.''
   Hoffman was one of three Americans and 174 other Westerners who
flew to freedom in Germany on Friday after talks between Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein and former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt. They had been detained since Iraqi forces overran Kuwait
Aug. 2.
   The other two freed Americans were Brenda and Don Swanke. Mrs.
Swanke's parents, Samuel and Gertrude Thomas of Oak Ridge, Tenn.,
were overjoyed to see their daughter and son-in-law on a television
newscast.
   ``It would be wonderful to have them home by Thanksgiving,''
Mrs. Thomas said.
   Hoffman's family said he was shot when Iraqi soldiers tried to
force their way into his Kuwait City apartment on Sept. 5. The
bullet shattered a bone in his left forearm and he was hospitalized
for about a week.
   He was later held at a strategic chemical plant 45 miles south
of Baghdad, they said. Westerners in Iraq have been used as ``human
shields'' to deter attack by the U.S.-led multinational forces
stationed in the Persian Gulf.
   Hoffman, a financial analyst with the Kuwaiti government, wore a
cast on his arm and appeared to be in pain. Some reports said
gangrene had developed from the wound.
   ``It's just marvelous. It's just wonderful,'' Hoffman's mother,
Ann, said of his release.
   Mrs. Hoffman said she wasn't planning a welcome home party just
yet.
   ``If he wants one, we'll have one,'' she said.
   Mrs. Hoffman said her son probably will have other things on his
mind, such as getting a job.
   ``He'll do exactly what he wants to do,'' she said. ``But I
don't think he'll stay here.''
   Hoffman's British fiancee, 27-year-old Nicola Murgatroyd, was
scheduled to arrive in Baghdad on Friday.
   Ms. Murgatroyd, who had planned to marry Hoffman Aug. 17, was
among 11 British women who traveled to Baghdad Friday to seek the
release of their captive husbands and relatives - against the
advice of their government.
   The British Foreign Office advised the women against going and
called the trip ``risky,'' but they ignored the advice.
   Mrs. Hoffman, who wrote several letters to Saddam urging her
son's release, said she doesn't know Ms. Murgatroyd's whereabouts
or whether she knows Hoffman has been released.
   ``We're all thinking about Nikki,'' she said.
   In Oak Ridge, Mrs. Thomas said she saw her daughter and
son-in-law on a Cable News Network report Thursday.
   ``They've lost a lot of weight and looked haggard,'' she said.
``Brenda mouthed, `Hi Mom.' She knew I'd be watching.''
   Swanke, who is in his 60s, has a heart problem. ``That is the
reason he has gotten out,'' Thomas said.
   The Swankes had been living in Kuwait City about eight months
before the invasion.Swanke, a vice president of DMJM International,
a Los Angeles-based engineering firm, had been hired by the Kuwaiti
government to help build a university in the city.
   Thomas expects his son-in-law will have to stay in Frankfurt a
few days for medical observation before the couple can come home.
   ``We don't know for sure if they are coming to Los Angeles or
Oak Ridge,'' he said.

   A recount Friday enabled former Mayor
Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr. to reclaim the post he was forced
from in 1984, but his eligibility to hold office was challenged
because of his felony conviction.
   The state Board of Elections, after an afternoon recount of
voting machines, declared Cianci the winner by 248 votes over
fellow Republican-turned-independent Frederick Lippitt.
   ``As far as comebacks go, sure it was a comeback,'' Cianci said.
``Maybe it was astonishing to some people but I always knew we
could do it.''
   A legal challenge immediately was filed by three Providence
voters, disputing Cianci's right to hold office.
   The challengers, who say they are not affiliated with Lippitt,
cite a 1986 amendment to the state Constitution that prevents
anyone convicted of a felony from holding office until three years
after the conclusion of their sentence and probation.
   Cianci pleaded no contest on April 24, 1984, to assaulting a man
he thought was having an affair with his estranged wife. His wife
testified Cianci went after the man with a fireplace log, a lit
cigarette and an ashtray. In Rhode Island, a no contest plea is
recorded as a conviction.
   The felony forced Cianci from office. His five-year suspended
sentence ended in 1989.
   Cianci said his campaign had researched the question, decided
the law could not be apply retroactively, and called the challenge
``strictly political.''
   ``The people have spoken. I think the people would rise up if
anyone tried to steal the election,'' said Cianci, who became a
popular radio talk show host after leaving office.
   The city Board of Canvassers planned to certify Cianci's victory
on Tuesday. Executive secretary Laurence Flynn said it would
consider the legal challenge later in the week.
   Cianci had led Lippitt by 105 votes going into the recount after
mail ballots were counted Thursday. His total then was 16,189.
   Both men had claimed victory Tuesday night in the three-way
race, which also included Democrat Andrew Annaldo.
   About 100 people watched and recorded the tallies as each of the
voting machines was opened and read into a public address system.
   Lippitt, 73, later hugged tearful supporters at his campaign
headquarters, and, with his voice cracking slightly, read a
statement giving Cianci the victory, but not his respect.
   Cianci ``has great talent, if he can put it to good use,''
Lippitt said. ``Not everyone is given a second chance and this time
I hope he really will be different.''
   Cianci's 10 years in office were some of the most corrupt in
recent city history, with 22 people connected to the administration
convicted of various crimes. Cianci never was charged in connection
with those misdeeds.

<TEXT>
   The hometown of Pennsylvania Gov. Robert
Casey is facing a fiscal crisis that could cost half of the 650
city workers their jobs, and the layoffs could start as soon as
next week, the mayor said Friday.
   The unions representing city firefighters, police and the public
works employees rejected a new health-benefits package Friday night
that Mayor James Connors said would save the city $1.5 million.
   In light of the unions' decisions, Connors said he expected to
begin the layoffs next week.
   He said he will consider options other than raising taxes,
adding: ``At some point someone has to represent the citizens,
someone has to represent the taxpayers.''
   The proposed layoffs could affect about 100 firefighters, about
70 police officers, 30 clerical workers and 78 Department of Public
Works employees.
   Connors said the city has enough money to meet only its payroll
this week.
   City officials said a court decision refusing to allow the city
to float a $4.5 million bond issue triggered the financial crunch.
Lackawanna County Court denied the bond issue Nov. 2. The city had
to win the court's approval because the money would be used for
payroll expenses.
   Scranton had counted on the bond for general operating expenses
when the City Council passed the current budget.
   Eugene Carroll, president of the local Fraternal Order of
Police, said the union voted 111-16 against the health-care plan,
calling it a ``giveback'' and violation of the union's contract.
   When asked what advice he would give to city residents who may
be served by a smaller police force, Carroll said, ``Buy a gun,
lock your doors and keep your children off the street.''
   The firefighters voted 169-15 against the plan. Paul Bernardi,
president of Local 669 of the International Association of
Firefighters, said he hoped the vote sent a message to the city
that ``we are not fooling around.''
   The public works union had voted earlier Friday to accept the
plan only if police and firefighters approved it.
   Both the police and firefighters' unions have minimum-manning
clauses in their contracts, calling for complements of 200 in the
Fire Department and 140 in the Police Department.
   On Thursday, the city's clerical workers rejected the health
benefits package the city offered, and Connors rejected a
counterproposal by the clerical union to negotiate a health care
package.
   The union's current contract with the city expires at the end of
the year.
   ``We want to bargain. We don't want it shoved down our
throats,'' said union representative Sal Maglio.
   ``We don't have any more concessions that we can make that won't
cost the taxpayers money,'' said Connors.
   Connors told WNEP-TV that those unions who vote for the new
benefits package would probably suffer fewer layoffs.

   A federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of
taped conversations between Manuel Noriega and his attorneys, but
Cable News Network defied the order Friday by playing another
recording.
   In the tape, Noriega discussed two potential government
witnesses with his defense team, and speculated on the prosecutors'
strategy.
   CNN President Tom Johnson defended the broadcast, calling the
judge's order ``unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys he
would hold the network in contempt of court if the tapes were
played, but did not act immediately.
   In an interview with a CNN producer broadcast later Friday,
Hoeveler said that whether or not he will find the network in
contempt ``remains to be seen.''
   Noriega's attorneys, meanwhile, accused the U.S. State
Department and the Panamanian government of President Guillermo
Endara of being the source of the tapes leaked to CNN.
   ``We believe the State Department had obtained copies of the
tapes, and gave them to the Endara government,'' said Noriega's
lead attorney Frank Rubino. ``A high-placed person in the Endara
government then provided them'' to CNN.
   A State Department spokesman said the agency was aware of
Rubino's comments, but had no immediate reaction.
   Noriega is charged in a February 1988 indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes to turn Panama into a way station for the
Medellin cocaine cartel's U.S.-bound drug shipments. He has been
held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami since
shortly after he surrendered in the wake of the December 1989 U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   The tape played Friday by CNN was a conversation between Noriega
and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for the two men.
She tells him two more people have been arrested in Panama, and
says he should review their names to determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were an Alfredo
Sanchez and Felipe Camargo, a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in
Panama who had been the general's top liaison with the Cubans and
is believed to be cooperating with the U.S. government.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,''
Noriega says. ``It says they are trying to induce any of the two of
them to testify before the court against me.''
   Other tapes played Friday were conversations between Noriega and
allies, including a discussion with his mistress' mother about the
transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Earlier Friday, Hoeveler extended for 10 days his order banning
CNN from using any portion of the tape that could compromise the
former Panamanian dictator's attorney-client privilege.
   ``I cannot conceive that the law of prior restraint is so
sacrosanct and so encompassing'' it would allow broadcasting a
confidential attorney-client conversation no matter how damaging to
the defense, Hoeveler wrote in his order.
   The judge has also told CNN to turn over the tapes to a federal
magistrate, but suspended that requirement after the network
appealed the gag order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said he was preparing arguments to be
delivered in Atlanta Monday balancing the right of free speech
against the right to a fair trial.
   ``Right now we are on the cutting edge of the law in both the
First Amendment and the Sixth Amendment,'' May said Friday. ``This
could end up very quickly in front of the Supreme Court.''
   The U.S. Justice Department Friday was continuing its
investigation into whether the tapes were made by the Bureau of
Prisons and how they got into CNN's hands, said spokesman Doug
Tillett.
   The Justice Department said the Bureau of Prisons had the legal
right to tape such calls and does so routinely, but May said
Noriega's attorneys were assured their clients calls would not be
taped.
   ``If he asked the guard to call his lawyers, we had been led to
believe that those calls would not be recorded,'' May said. And he
noted that the prison knew when Noriega spoke to the attorneys,
because the guards, and not the prisoner, dialed the calls.
   Noriega's attorneys say they expect to ask for dismissal of the
charges against their client if they can prove misconduct in making
or handling of the tapes.
   The government of Panama, which in January had said its
shattered legal system could not properly try Noriega, says it is
now in a position to prosecute him if the U.S. case falls apart.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' Endara said.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias said Noriega has ``very serious
charges against him'' in Panama.
   The Panamanian government has charged Noriega and at least seven
of his officers with looting the treasury.

   New Mexico authorities joined police
along Interstate 40 from California to North Carolina in a 24-hour
traffic safety crackdown that ended early Friday.
   The effort was the first involving every state crossed by the
more than 2,500 miles of I-40, New Mexico State Police Chief Neil
W. Curran said.
   ``Operation 24-40'' was organized by the New Mexico state police
and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, state police Lt. Bill
Kuehl said.
   I-40 extends about 380 miles across New Mexico from just west of
Gallup to just east of Tucumcari.
   Nationwide, nearly 5,700 tickets were issued, including 2,790
for speeding, said the International Association of Chiefs of
Police, which coordinated the crackdown.
   Police made 56 criminal arrests and seized small amounts of
marijuana and cocaine, the association said.
   In New Mexico, 603 traffic tickets were issued and one drunken
driving arrest was made, state police said.
   Two felony arrests were made in connection with the seizure of 2
grams of crack cocaine and the recovery of a stolen vehicle, Kuehl
said.
   ``It turned out to be a pretty good operation,'' he said. ``At
first we were afraid the weather would cause problems.''
   Icy roads were reported in a number of states.
   The effort was dubbed ``Operation 24-40'' for the number of
hours and the interstate number.
   In all, about 80 officers from the state police, New Mexico
Mounted Patrol and state Motor Transportation Division took part in
the crackdown in New Mexico.
   The New Mexico National Guard assisted motor transportation
officers, who primarily deal with commercial vehicles, Kuehl said.

   President Bush is ordering more than 150,000
additional American troops to the Persian Gulf, a move that nearly
doubles U.S. firepower in the region and marks a fundamental shift
toward an offensive military stance.
   Bush said Thursday in announcing the new wave of troop
deployments for Operation Desert Shield that he still hoped to get
Iraq out of Kuwait without starting a war. But he said he wanted an
``adequate offensive military option'' in case United Nations
economic sanctions and diplomatic pressures against Iraq prove
futile.
   Analysts said the move brought the United States closer to war
with Iraq.
   ``The Iraqis, in effect, are being put on notice that they will
be attacked'' unless they withdraw from Kuwait under Bush's terms,
said Frank Gaffney Jr., director of the Center for Security Policy
and a former Pentagon official.
   ---&equals;
   MOSCOW (AP) - The Soviet Union is giving its qualified approval
for the use of military force to drive Iraqi invaders out of Kuwait
if the economic embargo and other peaceful pressure tactics fail.
   But even as Secretary of State James A. Baker III accomplished
this goal in talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, it became apparent that Moscow would be a very
reluctant partner to such a move in the United Nations.
   Shevardnadze told reporters Thursday that the use of force
probably could not be ruled out. But later, when he was asked to
repeat the assertion, he laughed and said: ``I won't say.''
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration hasn't uttered the
dreaded ``R'' word yet concerning the economy, but it is getting
awfully close.
   President Bush on Thursday talked about ``tough times'' and
Michael Boskin, his chief economic adviser, spoke of the
possibility that the economy could contract in either the final
three months of this year or early 1991.
   Bush and Boskin both avoided using the term recession, but
Boskin opened the door to that possibility by discussing the
chances that the gross national product, the country's total output
of goods and services, might decline in one or more quarters.
   The traditional definition of a recession is two consecutive
quarters of declining GNP.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Sen. Alan Cranston's decision not to
seek re-election in 1992 because of prostate cancer has focused
attention on an already crowded field of would-be successors.
   But some of them may instead challenge the person Gov.-elect
Pete Wilson picks as his successor for California's other U.S.
Senate seat.
   Attracted by Cranston's political weakness stemming from his
involvement in the savings and loan scandal, at least 10 Democrats,
including former Gov. Jerry Brown, former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein and Walt Disney Corp. President Frank Wells, had
floated trial balloons about challenging Cranston or running if he
stepped down.
   Likely Republican candidates include former Rep. Ed Zschau, a
moderate who narrowly lost to Cranston four years ago. Zschau might
be challenged in the Republican primary by a conservative such as
former U.S. Treasurer Bay Buchanan, sister of Washington
commentator Pat Buchanan, or television commentator Bruce
Herschensohn, a former White House aide to Richard Nixon.

   OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) - A man convicted of sexually assaulting a
woman who testified against him with six of her 46 personalities
maintains she wasn't mentally ill and that she consented to have
sex with him.
   Mark A. Peterson, whom a jury Thursday found guilty of
second-degree sexual assault, denied he knew the 27-year-old woman
had a multiple-personality disorder and said he will appeal.
   ``I have been the victim for just having a fling with a girl,''
Peterson said. He faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine
during sentencing scheduled for Dec. 10. He remained free on
$10,000 bond.
   ``I still don't think she is mentally ill,'' Peterson said after
the verdict. ``What's there to be sorry about? Why should I be
sorry for her?''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Pawnshops are increasingly becoming home to the
gold that made the 1980s glitter as layoffs wrack Wall Street and
other industries.
   But after years of being rudely portrayed by Hollywood as a
usurous business preying on the impoverished, the pawnbroking
industry is loathe to be seen as a leading recessionary indicator.
   Lincoln Square Pawnbrokers is an example of the boom. Newly
hard-pressed New Yorkers have contributed to a 10 percent jump in
unreclaimed valuables hocked this year at the tiny pawnshop.
   ``This is the largest increase in 15 years,'' said owner Gary
Kalter. He said gold jewelry is his most frequently pawned item.

deliveries in a square-mile area with about 46,000 apartments and
condos near the affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood. They've signed

   Hundreds of people are fleeing
repressive Albania, but the welcome is wearing thin in Yugoslavia,
a troubled neighbor that already has ethnic problems with a large
Albanian minority.
   Officials say more than 600 Albanians have crossed the heavily
guarded border from their communist homeland so far this year,
compared to only 40 in 1989.
   Albania's leaders have begun cautious reforms and seek to emerge
from decades of self-imposed isolation, but many of their people
are taking a faster route to freedom.
   ``We were forced to escape after enduring years of horror,''
said Pashko Preldakaj, who led 20 people through the rugged
mountains of northern Albania last month. ``I cannot describe what
it is like to live in Albania.''
   Preldakaj's group evaded Albanian frontier guards in an
all-night trek that covered 20 miles from Nikc, his home village,
across a mountain range more than 6,000 feet high.
   Adults carried children in their arms, scrambling in the dark
over narrow, rocky trails above deep gorges, Preldakaj said.
   Yugoslav authorities routinely give escaping Albanians up to 30
days in jail for illegal entry, then turn them over to
representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   Judith Kumin, deputy director of the refugee agency, said they
may be kept in Yugoslavia temporarily if the United Nations pays
their expenses. She said the high commissioner's office has no way
of knowing how many people are caught trying to flee Albania.
   On average, Albanian refugees spend six months in Yugoslavia
before emigrating. Most go to the United States.
   The influx has created resentment in Serbia, Yugoslavia's
largest republic, where the refugees are kept while awaiting
resettlement outside the country.
   Exaggerated claims in Serbian media that 300,000 Albanians have
moved into the restive southern province of Kosovo in the past 50
years have incited ethnic hostility. Official statistics indicate
only 3,000 people from Albania have moved to Yugoslavia since 1945.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent the 1.9 million people in
Kosovo, the heart of medieval Serbia, where 60 people have been
killed in ethnic violence during the past year.
   Only four of the eight refugee centers in Yugoslavia still
accept Albanians.
   About half of them are housed in the federal detention center at
Padinska Skela, where conditions are described as overcrowded and
unsanitary, with up to three people sharing a cot.
   About 100 Albanians were moved out of a refugee center in
Koviljaca, southwest of Belgrade.
   Townspeople accused them of molesting local women and, after
allegations in the Serbian press that the refugees had poisoned the
town's water supply, held a public protest to demand the Albanians
be removed.
   ``We had to comply quickly before someone got hurt,'' Ms. Kumin
said.
   In the words of the Vecernje Novosti of Belgrade, a Serbian
newspaper: ``The townspeople felt they were living under Albanian
occupation, so they rose up against it, demanding that they (the
Albanians) be expelled.''
   Recent reports say Albanian authorities have softened their
shoot-to-kill policy on the border and have significantly reduced
the 25-year prison terms previously imposed on citizens caught
trying to flee.
   Soldiers on shore opened fire with automatic weapons, however,
when Aleksandar Gruda and 14 other people hijacked a naval patrol
boat Sept. 11 and headed for Yugoslavia, across Lake Scutari.
   Dozens of rounds hit the vessel, virtually demolishing the
superstructure. Gruda's 4-year-old daughter Anisa was killed by a
bullet that penetrated the hull and struck her in the head.
   ``One of the reasons we left was to provide her with a life
worthy of a human being,'' Gruda said.

   The Korean War ended 37 years ago. But a
six-hour PBS documentary, ``Korean: The Forgotten War,'' has
touched off a new battle even before the start of the series'
three-night run tonight.
   Retired Army Gen. R.G. Stilwell, a regimental commander during
the war and 20 years later the commander of United Nations forces
in South Korea, thinks it is a ``revisionist'' account favoring
North Korea and China.
   Not so, says Jon Halliday, a British writer who did the
documentary for Thames Television, a British commercial network
that undertook the project as a co-production with Boston public TV
station WGBH.
   ``I think we'll catch flak from both the left and the right,''
says WGBH executive producer Austin Hoyt, who says he shot new
interviews and rewrote some portions of the show to create a more
balanced account.
   The show's U.S. version, narrated by an American, includes
interviews with North Korean officers who fought in the war and
North Korean civilians.
   In one exotic case, there are comments by Joshua Chance, a man
of Jamaican-Chinese ancestry who Halliday says was with the massive
army of Chinese ``volunteers'' sent into the war when U.N. troops
pushed up to the Yalu River in late 1950.
   The show revives old controversies about the war, including the
charges of North Korea, which invaded the South with troops and
tanks in June 1950, that South Korea started the conflict.
   It also re-examines - and in the WGBH version, generally rebuffs
- the communist side's accusation that the United States waged germ
warfare in North Korea, charges sharply denied by the United
States.
   But the show is not solely about the three years of combat in
which military casualties on both sides came close to 2.4 million,
including 33,629 U.S. combat dead.
   It also offers views - Korean, Soviet, and American - of the
forces that led to the establishment of North and South Korea when
Korea was divided at the 38th Parallel after World War II.
   It also looks at the rise to power of Syngman Rhee in the South
and Kim Il Sung in the North, the harsh life under their regimes,
and what the North and South have become in the years following the
armed truce that ended the war.
   The origins of the series, Hoyt says, ``were really sort of a
revisionist view'' by Halliday and Bruce Cumings.
   The latter is a Chicago-based history professor with whom
Halliday wrote a book on the war. He is among those interviewed in
the series.
   ``I think they made a very good contribution to see the Korean
War in the context of Korea,'' Hoyt said.
   ``But there were a lot of battles at Thames between the official
British military historians and Cumings and Halliday over who was
responsible for the war, and whether the United States presence was
a destructive one.''
   Hoyt asked Stilwell to look at the series and offer comments,
and initially he was listed as a consultant on the WGHB version. He
later asked that his name and those of two colleagues be deleted.
The request was granted.
   The general said he basically objects to the series because he
considers it tilted toward the North Korean and Chinese viewpoint:
   ``I think they've (the show's makers) shown great cynicism about
the American effort to come to the aid of a nation under siege and
stay the course and secure the freedom of that country,'' he said.
   The show doesn't favor the communist side, Halliday said by
phone from London. In fact, he said, the Chinese ``refused to
cooperate with us'' in the making of the series.
   His goal ``was to make it as objective as possible,'' he said.
``That is, you have to listen to the voices of the competing
parties. But it's absolutely not pro-North Korean or
pro-communist.''
   His assessment of Hoyt's version of the series: ``I think there
is a tilt towards what I would call sort of the official U.S.
position.''
   All is well between Hoyt and Thames officials, according to
Hoyt, who says they have backed and are pleased with his changes.
He's philosophical about the war over the documentary:
   ``The fur is flying from both the left and the right. Frankly,
Gen. Stilwell thinks we didn't do enough to temper the revisionist
views of Halliday and Cumings, and Halliday and Cumings think I'm
in bed with Gen. Stilwell.''
   He doesn't anticipate peace for a while.
   ``The way I see it, this is sort of like Panmunjom,'' he said,
referring to the Korean site where peace talks dragged on for two
years before the war finally ended and where negotiations between
the former combatants still occur. ``There's not an armistice
yet.''

   BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE PREQUEL: CBS, which last season got high
ratings when it aired the pilot of what became ``I Love Lucy,''
tonight offers a retrospective of ``The Honeymooners,'' another top
CBS series that began during the Korean War. Hosted by Audrey
Meadows, who played Jackie Gleason's long-suffering wife, Alice,
the one-hour show is called ``The Honeymooners Anniversary
Special.''

   Robert Mathews says it was just a reflex
that led him to go into a burning house to rescue a 3-year-old boy
- three times.
   ``What got me, there were people just standing there,'' said
Mathews. And he couldn't pass the horror by.
   Mathews, 33, is unemployed. But he says he was reluctant to take
the $2,500 check that he won from the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission
this month. It is embarrassing, he says, to profit when the little
boy he saved, James Edwards, suffered such pain and disfigurement.
   ``I kind of don't like to take the money because he got burned
up and all,'' Mathews said. ``I really don't need the money right
away. ... I'll probably get him a little something for Christmas.''
   Mathews was driving his friend Carl Knopf to work Nov. 17, 1989,
when he saw smoke coming out of a house. A nightgown-clad Darla
Edwards was on the roof, screaming that her son was trapped in a
rear, second-floor bedroom.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Knopf said. ``We saw smoke, and he
stopped the car right in the middle of the road, ran to the house
and kicked in the door.''
   Twice he was driven back by smoke and heat. On the third try,
Mathews put a coat over his mouth, took flashlight in hand, rushed
up the stairs and found James unconscious and on fire. He was
burned on 85 percent of his body.
   ``There were flames coming out of the room. Part of his arm was
still on fire. The coat I had over my mouth to keep the smoke out
of me I put on his arm to get the fire out,'' said Mathews.
   ``He lost the outer part of his ears and all his fingers,''
Mathews said. ``I just wish I could have come along a little bit
earlier.''
   The boy was released from the hospital this summer, and is back
at home after plastic surgery. Surgeons have fashioned thumbs out
of his flesh.
   The Carnegie honor is one of several that have come Mathews'
way. Warren Fire Chief Roger Hernon hopes the publicity will get
him a job.
   Mathews hasn't worked in more than a year, unable to find a job
in this Rust Belt city in northeast Ohio. The area fell on hard
times during the 1970s and 1980s, when the steel industry declined.
   Mathews lives in a one-room apartment and uses welfare payments
to pay his rent and keep his car running. He has moved from job to
job, laying carpet, hanging dry wall, doing maintenance work and
working as a security guard.
   As a child, his family was burned out of their home. But there
was no foreshadowing of the heroism he exhibited a year ago.
   ``It was especially a thrill to me the way he did it,'' said
Hernon, the fire chief. ``He made an attempt up the stairs, ran
back down and got a coat and ran upstairs and rescued the baby.
   ``The thing that impressed me most was everybody today is
saying, `What's in it for me?' ... You've heard, `Let George do
it.' Well, he was George. It reaffirms your faith in your fellow
man.''

   David Guillen was walking from his apartment
to an outdoor phone booth one night last December when he saw two
men shove a 13-year-old boy and order him to give up his moped.
   Guillen, a 32-year-old truck driver who had grown tired of crime
in his neighborhood, told the men to leave the boy alone.
   They did. And one man shot Guillen to death.
   Nearly a year after the Dec. 1, 1989, shooting in this Los
Angeles suburb, the David Guillen killing remains unsolved, with no
arrests and apparently no leads. But Guillen's action was not
forgotten.
   The Carnegie Hero Fund Commission posthumously awarded Guillen
with one of its medals Nov. 1.
   To Guillen's friends and family, his actions came as no
surprise.
   ``He'd give you the shirt off his back, then end up the next day
without a shirt,'' said brother Tony Guillen.
   Among his friends and family, he was known as something of a
character, doing things like helping strangers stranded on the
freeway and talking to just about everybody he met on the street.
   Guillen had big plans. He worried the neighborhood was getting
too dangerous for his pregnant girlfriend and their son, Alex. He
wanted to move to the Sacramento area, and put in a request to
transfer to his trucking company's Northern California office.
   ``He just wanted to get to a smaller, safer place,'' said Yvonne
Pechenco, his girlfriend of five years. ``He was tired of all the
violence, where you couldn't watch the news without all the
drive-bys and shootings.''
   Guillen was so sure the transfer was coming that late last year
he told Yvonne to start packing, and he had the utilities shut off
in their apartment.
   As of the first day of December 1989, the phone was
disconnected. With boxes filled and ready to move, Guillen needed
to make a quick telephone call to a relative.
   The nearest phone was at a market across the street. At about
7:30 p.m., Guillen left the apartment.
   ``It looked like what we call a street shakedown robbery,'' said
Los Angeles County sheriff's Detective Michael Lee. ``These guys
were hassling a young man. Guillen says this and that and tried to
intervene. For his trouble, he got shot.''
   His death left scars that have been slow to heal.
   Miss Pechenco, who gave birth to Guillen's son, David, six
months after the shooting, still can't bring herself to return to
work and put her life back on course. Not as long as the case is
unsolved, she said.
   ``I have it in me to go, maybe to Arizona or something, but
something keeps telling me to stay,'' said Miss Pechenco, raising
the two boys and living in her mother's East Los Angeles apartment.
   Guillen also has two other children, both daughters, by a
previous marriage. The $2,500 Carnegie award and the medal went to
Guillen's oldest child, 13-year-old Norma, by his first marriage.
   A year later, tears still well in the eyes of his mother, Pilar
Guillen, when she talks about him.
   Told his son was considered a hero, she answered in Spanish:
``That doesn't bring my son back.''

   Ask Michael Radwich about his 1974 Malibu
and he'll regale you with tales of cranking up his pride and joy on
a local stock car racetrack, and how he hopes next year will be his
big year.
   Ask about the rescue that won him an award from the Carnegie
Hero Fund Commission and made him a much-admired local celebrity
and he's apt to roll his eyes, grin an engaging grin and emit a
series of ``Yeps'' and ``Nopes.''
   ``It's all right, I guess,'' he says.
   A year ago, Radwich grabbed co-worker Scott Pierce and fought a
desperate tug-of-war with a gravel grinder hungry to snatch both
men into its rusty maw.
   Today, he doesn't know what made him risk his life for a man who
was no more than a casual acquaintance. Nothing in his previous 23
years had raised the issue of what he would do if it came to a
decision between standing aside or chancing death.
   ``I never really thought about it to tell you the truth,'' he
said in a recent interview from his modest apartment tucked behind
the hardware store in this western Massachusetts town of 1,700.
   ``I figured I had to do something. I couldn't leave him.''
   Radwich still works at the gravel plant, and he still carries
the marks of his actions, a bent and scarred left thumb he can
wiggle only about a half-inch. Left-handed, he had to teach himself
to write again, and it will be a few more months before he can go
back to his passion, stock-car racing.
   ``My doctor says one crazy thing to another,'' he said with a
laugh.
   The man he rescued has a little more to say.
   ``I'm just glad someone was there that was quick thinking. If he
wasn't there I would have been killed. My arm would have been torn
off by the shaft and I would definitely have been killed,'' Pierce
said.
   ``There aren't enough words. `Thanks' seems to be all right with
him.''
   The accident occurred Oct. 18, 1989, while the 21-year-old
Pierce and Radwich were trying to repair the grinder, a large
structure towering 80 feet above the ground that on a good day
clanks and throbs as it spits out gravel and sand.
   ``He moved in to look at something. He had a shirt on that was
unbuttoned and the tails came out and got wrapped up in the shaft
and he reached in to try to pull it out and that's when he got
caught up in it,'' Radwich recalled.
   ``He started yelling to shut it off and the switch to shut it
off was down on the ground so I grabbed a hold of him,'' he said.
   After a third man hit an emergency switch on the ground, the two
men fell back on the platform, Pierce with his left arm hanging on
by the triceps, Radwich with his left thumb all but severed.
   Both men have regained use of their injured limbs through
operations and therapy, but neither is back 100 percent.
   The two men said they've become closer since.
   ``He doesn't expect anything from me,'' Pierce said. ``When we
see each other we talk and stuff, but he never says, `Well, since I
did this you go down to the store and get me something.' He treats
me just like everybody else.''

   Roy Aden didn't hesitate when he saw a man
grab a gun away from a state trooper.
   ``If you don't help someone in need, then you're a failure,'' he
says. ``And one failure can destroy your whole life.''
   Aden, 48, a former Marine who still sports a crew cut, jumped in
when state trooper Christopher Phillips was on the verge of losing
a life-and-death struggle with a man in front of the Skyland, N.C.,
service station where Aden worked.
   ``I feel good about being recognized, but I didn't do it for
that,'' he said. ``I'd like to think another person would do the
same thing.''
   After working the late-night shift at the Exxon station last
Feb. 11, Aden saw Phillips pull over a car in front of the gas
pumps. As the trooper approached the car, the driver got out and
pulled out a large hunting knife.
   After Phillips took the weapon away, the man bolted. Phillips
caught up with him, and they struggled. As he tried to cuff him,
the man grabbed Phillips' service revolver from its holster.
   That's when Aden rushed to the trooper's aid.
   ``He was on top of the trooper and I came up from behind and
pulled him off. That's when I saw the gun point up in the air,''
Aden said. ``The man screamed, `Get away. I've got a gun!' I held
his arm and the gun went off.
   ``We were struggling and we went down. This guy was pretty
strong. It took both of my hands to hold his one hand. Then Trooper
Phillips regained his balance and the two of us grabbed hold of the
gun.
   ``I didn't even think about what had happened until it was
over,'' he said. ``He could have killed both of us.''
   When word of his deed hit the local media, Aden was recognized
as a hero. He received awards from the highway patrol, several
local civic organizations and Gov. Jim Martin.
   ``To tell you the truth, if I didn't help, I wouldn't have been
able to look at myself in the mirror the next morning,'' he said.
``My mother and father raised me to know the difference between
right and wrong.''
   Aden admits he's far from infallible. He's been married three
times, the last 10 years to his wife, Pat, who urged her husband to
intervene when she saw the trooper in trouble.
   With her help, Aden has kicked a drinking problem. The day
before he received the Carnegie award and a $2,500 cash prize, he
lived up to his promise to her and went to church for the first
time in years. He used part of the money to help his sister pay
some overdue bills.
   Aden said he found it difficult to accept the Carnegie award
after he learned that three of the winners died in their attempts
to save others.
   It reminded him of how he felt after receiving the Silver Star
and other medals upon returning from duty in Vietnam, where many of
his friends were killed or seriously injured.
   ``The ones who died - those are the real heroes,'' he said. ``I
may have risked my life, but they gave it.''

   Larry Ogletree doesn't think of himself as a hero.
   The Evans, Ga., man said he was just doing what he hopes anyone
would do when he chased a runaway car, dodged traffic and stopped
an oncoming 18-wheeler to rescue a 2-year-old boy inside the car.
   ``If one of my sons were in a life-threatening situation,
whether it be that or anything, I would want somebody to do the
same thing,'' said Ogletree, general manager for the American
National Insurance Cos. office in Augusta and the father of three
boys, ages 12, 7 and 4.
   Ogletree, 40, had just turned onto a busy five-lane highway in
suburban Martinez on his way to work Aug. 8, 1989, when he spotted
the silver compact car rolling out of a convenience store parking
lot.
   ``It just didn't look normal,'' he said. ``There was something
wrong. The wheels weren't turning or anything. Then I saw the
child's head in the back of the car.''
   He also saw a woman, later identified as the child's mother,
standing in the parking lot screaming.
   ``At that point, I knew what was happening,'' Ogletree said.
   He jumped the median in his own car and parked, then began
chasing the runaway car, which was traveling diagonally across
traffic headed into the path of the oncoming tractor-trailer rig.
   ``I looked up at the 18-wheeler,'' Ogletree said. ``His and my
eyes met. He just understood and he, of course, applied his brakes.
He was about 10 feet from the car. I was running the whole time.''
   Ogletree finally got close enough to grab the driver's side of
the car, which was open. ``I threw myself into it. I had a hold of
the steering wheel and applied the brakes. The child was calm until
I hit the brakes. Then he started crying. He was in a safety
seat.''
   Ogletree, who escaped with only scarred shins, said he believes
the boy's sister accidentally hit the gearshift when she got out of
the car, allowing the car to roll.
   The mother thanked him but implored him not to release her name
or the names of her children, a request he has honored.
   Ogletree said he didn't fully grasp what might have happened
until that night, when he went to pick up his two younger boys at a
day-care center adjacent to the convenience store.
   ``I guess that at that point it kind of came over me I might not
have been there to pick them up. It was very emotional,'' he said.
   Frank Spears, an insurance agent in a competing firm, has known
Ogletree more than 10 years and said he wasn't surprised by his
actions.
   ``He's that kind of a fellow,'' Spears said. ``He is not one
that sits on the sidelines. He is a doer, a mover, a shaker. If you
go into a fight, you want him to be behind you.''
   ``I don't think any of us were prepared for the fact that
someone would have the courage to do what he did,'' said Carol
Shearer, a volunteer at the Columbia County Humane Society, who met
Ogletree, now the group's president, about two years ago. ``He's
been very modest about it.''

<HEAD>Big Dip in Small-Business Confidence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The small-business optimism index fell in
October to its lowest level in more than 10 years, presaging a
shrinking of the economy in the final quarter of the year.
   Economist William C. Dunkelberg, who analyzed replies from more
than 2,000 small- and medium-size businesses, said gross national
product would decline by 1.5 percent, ``the first official quarter
with negative growth.''
   Dunkelberg said the responses suggested the decline would be
accompanied by higher unemployment and worsening inflation, and he
blamed the latter partly on what he said was Congress' failure to
solve the deficit problem.
   Adding to inflationary pressures, he said, was the prospect that
Congress is ``prepared to heap on a whole new set of cost-raising
regulations,'' including various mandated costs and paperwork that
will consume time and effort.
   The index is based on responses from members of the National
Federation of Independent Business, which claims more than 500,000
members, ranging from proprietorships to companies with sales in
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The federation says the business community it represents employs
about half the private non-farm work force and produces about 50
percent of gross national product, and that its optimism index
foretells economic direction.
   Its estimate of third-quarter gross national product, for
example, was for a gain of 1.7 percent on an annual basis, just
one-tenth of one percent from the Commerce Department's preliminary
estimate of a 1.8 percent gain.
   Dunkelberg, dean of Temple University's school of business and
management, was especially critical of what he said was
legislation-induced inflation resulting from imposition of
regulations and mandates on an already stressed private sector.
   Among regulations he said would add to business costs were a
rise in the minimum wage and ``mandated health costs, mandated
leaves, mandated access for the handicapped, mandated pollution
controls, and lots of related `paperwork' that will eat up valuable
entrepreneurial time.''
   In effect, he said, mandates are a form of taxation atop
official taxation, which the responding companies declared the No.
1 problem facing small business today.
   The Federal Reserve, he said, cannot reduce this kind of
inflation through monetary policy, adding that ``only Congress can
do it with some responsible legislation and some common sense.''
   While many people expect the Fed to ease up on the money supply
and allow interest rates to fall, Dunkelberg discounted the
possibility. Inflation fears, he said, will simply prevent any
major easing.
   A large factor in the decline of the confidence index was what
Dunkelberg said was the ``incredible'' finding that 43 percent of
the companies expect business conditions to worsen, almost double
the previous quarter's level.
   Expected business conditions is one of 10 items making up the
index. Among others are expected sales volumes, expected credit
conditions, current job openings, plans to hire and capital outlay
plans.
   The index was begun in 1974 and uses 1978 conditions as its base
of 100. The latest reading of 92.3 was the lowest since the second
quarter of 1980, when the all-time low of 81.1 was reached.
   Aside from the all-time low, the latest reading was the lowest
for any quarter since the first year of the index's existence, when
it reached 87.8 in early 1975.
   Summing up he results, Dunkelberg said ``it's clear the economy
is going down, at least for a short count.'' The expansion wasn't
marked by extremes, he said, ``and it is likely the slowdown that
follows will be equally boring.''

   If you look for a spark of life in the stock
market these days, the search pretty much begins and ends with
electric utility issues.
   While the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was climbing to
record highs near the 3,000 mark earlier this year, the electric
utility group languished in disfavor.
   But since late summer, as fears of recession gripped the
markets, the roles have been reversed. From its low point for the
year on Aug. 24 through Nov. 2, Dow Jones's average of 15 utilities
climbed more than 13 percent.
   Among the 15 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange
that made new 52-week highs in the week ended Nov. 2, nine were
shares of electric companies - from DQE Inc. in Pittsburgh to
Houston Industries in Texas, from Dominion Resources on the East
Coast to Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in California.
   As often happens in periods of market euphoria, investors
shunned the group in the spring and early summer while they looked
for racier ways to benefit from rising stock prices.
   Now, analysts say, money is flowing back the other way looking
for a high-yielding haven from the perils of a bear market.
   ``Investing in the electric utilities in a climate of economic
weakness presents something close to a win-win situation,''
maintains Barry Abramson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, in a recent report spotlighting the group.
   ``Electric utilities would be strong in a sideways market. If
the economy continues to stagnate and the stock and bond markets
show no clear direction, the electric utilities should outperform
thanks to their superior and very safe yields.
   ``On the other hand, if a recession continues to threaten and
the Federal Reserve eases dramatically, falling interest rates
would also provide a catalyst for the group.
   ``In fact, just about the only scenario that would be negative
for the electric utilities would be a rapidly strengthening economy
and a renewed bull market - a very unlikely outcome, at least in
the near term.''
   The current level of utility dividends - the stocks yielded
about 6.7 percent, on average, as of early this month - is an
attraction by itself.
   Beyond that, analysts say, utility profits and payouts aren't
much affected by the ups and downs of the business cycle, and can
even keep growing gradually in periods of recession.
   ``They offer high dividends that our analysts believe are
secure,'' said Jack Lavery, director of global research at Marrill
Lynch.
   Utilities also stand to be prime beneficiaries of declining
interest rates, since lower rates reduce the relative allure of
bonds as the two classes of securities compete for the favor of
yield-conscious investors.
   But that last point has a flip side, caution some wary
utility-watchers. When hopesfor lower rates go unfulfilled,
utility stocks often bear the brunt of their frustration.
   The group fell sharply last January, for example, when a rise in
worldwide interest rates caught many optimists off guard.
   Whether the news is good or bad, however, many observers say
utilities' ultra-sensitivity to changing interest-rate expectations
often qualifies them as an advance indicator of where the rest of
the stock market might be heading.
   Said William LeFevre at Advest Inc.: ``Frequently the utilities
turn early, both before the broad stock market starts down and
before it turns up.''

<HEAD>All Men (Sic) May Be Equal, But What About Women?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just a minute, Karlyn Kohrs Campbell.
   Hold on there, Kathleen Hall Jamieson.
   What do you think you're doing?
   You set out to write a serious, scholarly, maybe
just-a-little-dull book about the crucial role that language plays
in the making of a successful presidency.
   You say you want to ``demonstrate rhetoric to be a fundamental,
constitutive element of the presidency.''
   That you've done.
   The University of Chicago Press published it.
   The title is ``Deeds Done in Words: Presidential Rhetoric and
the Genres of Governance.''
   It is full of arcane language and heavy thoughts.
   ``The special character of presidential inaugural addresses is
defined by these general epideictic features and by the nature of
the inauguration ceremony,'' you write.
   Stuff like that.
   You didn't set out to write, one would think, a feminist tract.
   But that you've done, too.
   You've dedicated your book: ``To the women who should have been
president; to the women who tried to be president; to the women who
will be president.''
   In footnote 12 to Chapter 4, you drop your bombshell. You've
read every State of the Union address ever delivered, and
discovered that in these speeches, women are invisible.
   ``Through 1966,'' you write, ``they are mentioned only twice,
once in relation to polygamy, by (Ulysses) Grant; once in relation
to suffrage, by (Woodrow) Wilson. More recently they have been
alluded to indirectly in Ronald Reagan's statements supporting
abortion.''
   And to drive home your point about the maleness of presidential
vision, you turn to a linguistic device. You use ``sic'' to show
that the words quoted are reproduced exactly as they appeared in
the original.
   You use ``sic'' to show that in their most formal rhetoric,
presidents have always talked about (and thought about) ``he'' when
they might have said (and thought about), ``he or she.''
   In this book, sic is a scythe.
   Look:
   - Quoting the Constitution: the president ``shall from time to
time give to the Congress information on the state of the Union and
recommend to their consideration such measures as he (sic) shall
judge necessary and expedient.''
   - Quoting George Washington: ``The magnitude and difficulty of
the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being
sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her
citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his (sic) qualifications,
could not but overwhelm with despondence one who ought to be
peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.''
   - Quoting Theodore Roosevelt: ``Our aim is to recognize what
Lincoln pointed out: The fact that there are some respects in which
men (sic) are obviously not equal ....''
   - Quoting Harry Truman: ``In all that we do we should remember
who we are and what we stand for. We are Americans. Our forefathers
(sic) had far greater obstacles than we have, and much poorer
chances of success.''
   - Quoting Lyndon Johnson: ``For our ultimate goal is a world
without war, a world made safe for diversity, in which all men
(sic), goods and ideas can freely move across every border and
every boundary.''
   What's up?
   In an interview, author Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School
of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, ducks.
   ``That's my co-author,'' says Ms. Jamieson. ``We let the senior
author do the stylistic stuff. If it had been up to me, I'd have
settled for a statement in the introduction. You can make the point
once. Your readers are smart enough.''
   So, senior author Campbell, professor of speech-communication at
the University of Minnesota, what are all these sics here for?
   ``As kind of a reminder to the audience about the very real male
character of political thinking in this country in the past. ... I
don't think of it as a feminist book, but I think of it as a book
that has some feminist sensibility.''
   So take note, Mister (sic) Presidents.

<HEAD>In N.C., the Acrid Aftermath of a Bitter Senate Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what they did and what they didn't do
after their bitter U.S. Senate race, Jesse Helms and Harvey Gantt
symbolized the rift in a state deeply divided over its most
conspicuous member of Congress.
   Helms gleefully tweaked his antagonists, the ``ultraliberal
establishm'' promising to press on with his agenda, a
combination of traditional anti-big government conservatism and
anti-abortion, anti-homosexual and other appeals.
   ``Can't you just hear the sobs?'' he asked with a broad smile
after winning his fourth term.
   Gantt acknowledged only that Helms received more votes, refusing
to phone the state's senior senator or officially concede. ``I
don't concede to that kind of campaign or that kind of vision for
North Carolina,'' he said.
   ``There's no way to extend a hand,'' said Professor John
Aldrich, chairman of Duke University's political science
department. He and other analysts, and voters themselves, said
Helms' strongly held views and iconoclastic style leave few
constituents lukewarm about him.
   Some North Carolinians voted for Helms as a folk hero, others
voted against him as an embarrassment.
   Many of Helms' supporters feel proud - and, some say, relieved -
that the ultraconservative Republican pulled out a victory. They
still smart, however, at labels they say were pinned on them during
the campaign: illiterate, uneducated, racist.
   Gantt's faithful boast of the strong showing - 47.4 percent of
the vote - by the black challenger, who had been given little
chance when he entered the contest. They're determined to ``try,
try again.'' For now, though, many say they feel unrepresented.
   Two North Carolinians whose votes canceled each other out
illustrate the strong feelings Helms elicits.
   Joe Overby voted for Helms. He likes the senator's conservative
fiscal and social views. Overby said he's concerned about the
growing national debt, troubled by the influence of liberal
politicians and commentators. Just as much, he likes Helms' refusal
to compromise even when under harsh attack.
   ``He's the only man that's ever run for office who said he'd do
so and so, and he's done it. He won't back down,'' said Overby, 80,
who arrived at a Helms post-election rally wearing the
stars-and-stripes top hat and jacket of Uncle Sam.
   A printed card he gave a reporter contains his picture and
examples of his philosophy, which he said reflects his idea of the
``traditional North Carolina values'' that Helms said he
represented.
   ``Let's all read our Bible,'' the card says in part. ``Let us
thank God that we live in the greatest nation in all the world.''
   Helms' won 58 percent of the votes of older North Carolinians
and 67 percent of the white Protestant vote, along with support
from traditional Republicans and others, according to exit polls.
He won about 65 percent of the white vote overall, and did better
in rural areas.
   Younger, more urban people tended to vote for Gantt, and he
garnered 93 percent of the black vote, according to the polls.
   Clarence McAdoo, 36, a black custodian at a public school in
Greensboro, fits that profile - and he said he saw North Carolina's
divisions deepening with Helms' campaign and victory.
   He cited a television ad Helms used late in the campaign when
polls indicated the race was close. It showed the hands of a white
job seeker crumpling an application after being told that racial
quotas required the position go to someone else, even though that
person was less qualified.
   ``The old bogey-man tactics,'' said McAdoo.
   Gantt said a day after the election that he may have
underestimated race as a factor among voters. ``We have to deal
with the question of race as a state,'' he said.
   Taking a lunch break from his custodial duties, McAdoo said the
racial message he picked up from Helms hurt, and he told a story
about his children.
   ``My youngest two came over last night to help me clean up after
the election (the school had been a polling place), and we talked
about it as we were riding home. There was a mock election at
school that day and it showed Mr. Gantt was going to win. So they
were disappointed, too.
   ``I told them not to look at the race as a black-and-white
issue. I don't want them to get that type of mentality,'' McAdoo
said. ``It's more or less that, when at first you don't succeed,
try, try again. I'm just trying to teach them the old-fashioned
values, like I was taught.''
   State Republican party officials denied race decided the
election, and local organizers contended the charge was just part
of an unfair view of the voters they knew.
   ``I keep reading about the stereotype, that it was a racist
thing,'' said Patrick Farmer, GOP chairman in Onslow County, which
voted 61 percent-39 percent for Helms while also electing a black
Democratic judge by a landslide. The racism charge ``just wouldn't
be borne out.''
   Farmer said he resented the way Helms voters often were
portrayed, especially as the television networks focused on the
North Carolina race. ``One of the newscasters said, `Well,
obviously the Helms supporters are the illiterate, tobacco-chewing,
uneducated people.'''
   But Farmer described them as ``a cross-section of everyone'' -
business people like himself, retirees, farmers, factory workers.
They ``breathed a sigh of relief'' when the election was over
because of the sharp political differences between their candidate
and his opponent.
   ``We're glad to have someone in Washington who does say no,'' he
said.
   Gantt made no effort to conceal his liberal credentials.
Government has a role, he said, in solving education, enviromental
and health care problems. He called Helms ``the last of a dying
breed'' of Southern politician.
   A day before the election, Helms fired back at Gantt in familiar
style: ``He is bought and paid for by militant left-wing groups
such as NARAL (National Abortion Rights Action League), the
homosexuals, the lesbians ... the ACLU - you name it ...
   ``They just want to get this conservative, Jesse Helms, out of
Congress.''
   Campaigning before white audiences, Helms accused Gantt of
running a ``secret campaign'' to get black voters to the polls.
Some voters remembered Helms' 12-year tenure in the 1960s and early
'70s as an on-air commentator for a Raleigh television station,
during which he called civil rights leaders communists and blasted
war protesters and the press.
   ``He operates by playing on the fears of people about secular
devils,'' said political science professor Abraham Holzman of North
Carolina State University. ``Degenerate devils, homosexual devils,
abortionist devils, liberal devils.''
   Some Gantt supporters described Helms in terms of evil, too, and
such bitterness can't be put aside at the end of the campaign,
Holtzman said, asking, ``How can you shake hands with the devil?''
   Aldrich, the Duke professor, said changing demographics may
eliminate the gulf. Helms won votes from people born in the South,
but more and more North Carolinians are emigres from other states,
he said. He also noted the younger vote against the 69-year-old
senator and the declining populations in many rural areas, a Helms
stronghold.
   Eventually, Helms no longer will have the kind of majority he
assembled, Aldrich said.
   ``Then,'' he said, ``the acrimony level will drop off
tremendously.''

<HEAD>Economic Frustration, But Little Direction in Voting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those looking for economic signals in Tuesday's
election noted lots of frustration with the status quo.
   The economy was a top concern among voters, according to surveys
conducted outside polling places. But the resolve to bear any
burden to rebuild the economy was much less evident.
   The results defied a simple label: anti-Bush, anti-tax,
anti-incumbent, anti-spending. There was evidence of all that,
leaving the surviving office holders to wonder what their next
moves ought to be.
   Raise taxes? Forget it.
   The voters turned out governors in Florida and Kansas associated
with tax hikes, and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., was nearly defeated
because of state tax increases initiated by Democratic Gov. Jim
Florio, who wasn't even on the ballot.
   Cut the deficit? OK, but watch where you cut.
   Candidates endorsed by President Bush were blistered by the
voters, partly because of his awkward handling of the federal
budget compromise. Incumbents in Congress, who were also a party to
the pre-election deficit deal, mostly were returned to office, but
margins were shockingly slim in many cases.
   Raise money for public projects through bond issues? Not so
fast.
   Propositions for prison construction, colleges, parks,
environmental initiatives and housing loans went down to defeat.
   Voters seemed disenchanted with government in general. Indeed,
one lucky survivor, Republican William Weld, won the governor's
office in Massachusetts by promising to pare government and ``keep
the priority list short.''
   Even more troubling were the large numbers of voters who chose
to bypass the election, many because they had lost faith in the
problem-solving ability of any politicians.
   Yet the results did not suggest an all-out tax revolt. In
Massachusetts, for instance, the voters rejected a ballot
initiative that would have rolled back state taxes by about $2
billion a year.
   The voters called instead for new ideas. They elected Democrat
Lawton Chiles governor of Florida because he promised to spurn
special interests and listen to the people. Chiles's grassroots
campaign included talking with people at recycling centers,
teen-age pregnancy programs and day-care centers.
   The economic mandate was best articulated by House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., himself a re-election survivor, who
said the president had to ``come to Capitol Hill with an action
plan for reviving the economy and reworking the system to the
benefit of working families.''
   The goal - to rework the system - was clear, but the plan for
achieving it wasn't. Leaders from the statehouse to the White House
faced the challenge of designing fresh approaches from a limited
array of options.

<HEAD>MARKETS: Attention Turns Back to Fed, Middle East</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The markets, for their part, went right on hoping for an easy
way out of the economic downturn: namely, looser credit from the
Federal Reserve.
   The quickest fix for the economy would be a bigger-than-normal
shot of inflation. That would make debts carried by all entities -
government, businesses and households - a lot easier to shoulder.
   The Fed gave a pre-election sign that credit would ease when it
lowered the rate charged on overnight loans between banks in
response to thebudget compromise. The markets were hoping for
still more.
   The forecast for lower rates prompted heavy demand for $34
billion in new government securities offered for sale in a
quarterly refunding by the Treasury. Investors gobbled up the new
bonds and notes to lock in current interest rates.
   Meanwhile, traders worried about the prospects for war, now that
national officials have the election behind them.
   Stocks and bonds tumbled and oil rallied the day after election,
mostly in response to new signals that war could be imminent in the
Persian Gulf. Among those reviving such talk was the normally
reliable British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Two oil market analysts even tried to narrow the window for war
by analyzing the tides and the moon.
   Peter Beutel and Thomas Blakeslee of Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc. said the best time for attack would be after midnight between
Nov. 12 and Nov. 22. The Kuwaiti tide would be high after midnight,
allowing commandos to get closer to a potential beachhead. The moon
phase would keep the sky dark.

<HEAD>COMPANIES: Retailers Continue Their Swoon</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top retailers reported dismal sales for October,
heightening concerns about the Christmas season.
   Several companies, including Sears, Roebuck and J.C. Penney Co.,
said sales were down from October of last year.
   The retail business has been slow since August, due to
uncertainty over the economy and the Persian Gulf, and most experts
said the slump would continue through the holidays.
   One analyst, Jeffrey Feiner of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said
shoppers had settled into ``a recessionary psychology.''
   The impact on holiday sales could be devastating for
storekeepers - and mean smaller, cheaper gifts under the tree.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Some Good News on Auto Sales</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Auto sales provided some unexpected good news. Sales of North
American-made cars and light trucks rose 8.5 percent in late
October and were up 5.7 percent for the first month of the 1991
model year.
   But the figures clashed with comments from dealers, who said
people were looking but not buying the new models.
   Meanwhile, the government issued a report showing the
productivity of American workers climbed at the fastest pace in two
years during the July-September quarter. But the number of hours
worked declined, indicating businesses were making do with fewer
employees.
   A Labor Department report on producer prices showed wholesale
inflation soared in October for the third consecutive month. Rising
energy prices were to blame.

<HEAD>ADVERTISING: How to Squash a Volvo</HEAD>

   Volvo owners should not try this one at home.
   A TV commercial by the automaker showed a Volvo holding up to a

vehicles in the path of the truck were squashed to a pulp.
   How did the Volvo survive? That was precisely what the Texas
Attorney General's office wanted to know.
   The answer was the car had been reinforced with steel or wood.
   Under pressure from the ornery Texas regulators, Volvo agreed to
make no unproven claims, run corrective newspaper ads and pay the
state $316,250 in investigative costs.

<HEAD>Consumers Match Markets' Gloomy Mood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American consumer gives little promise of
providing much help as the economy and Wall Street struggle into
the last few weeks of a difficult year.
   Surveys that seek to measure sentiment among the shopping public
show a pronounced mood of caution heading into the traditional peak
season for business at the nation's retail stores.
   Even if consumers were inclined to come riding to the rescue,
analysts say, all the economic evidence shows them low on
ammunition in the form of money to spend.
   ``Personal income growth is slowing markedly,'' observed David
Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International in New
York.
   ``This decline reflects the triple threat of declining total
employment, higher taxes and surging energy costs. None of these
holds much hope for quick relief.
   ``Nor do the other main factors that influence consumer spending
look encouraging. The sharp decline in stock prices since mid-July
and the ongoing slide in housing values has slashed household
wealth.
   ``Market interest rates may be edging down, but there's no
evidence that this is lowering consumer borrowing costs.''
   October sales reports issued by major retailers this past week
provided a gloomy picture, on balance, of the state of demand at
the threshold of the holiday selling season.
   Figures due this Wednesday from the Commerce Department on
retail sales for October are likely to show a drop about 0.2
percent, according to the Merrill Lynch Market Letter.
   Adjusted for inflation, ``sales have been essentially flat since
June,'' Merrill Lynch analysts say. ``We think sales will weaken
through the fourth quarter and into early 1991.''
   A primary damper on consumers' optimism, by common agreement,
has been the near doubling of oil prices that has accompanied the
showdown in the Persian Gulf over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   At their recent levels, energy costs act in the manner of a tax
increase, draining disposable income from consumers' wallets and
checkbooks.
   Beyond that, analysts say, enthusiasm has been chilled by
heightened uncertainty over what gasoline, heating fuel and
petroleum-based products will cost in the future.
   Three months into the crisis, economists, investors and
consumers are still able only to guess among a broad range of
possible outcomes in the Middle East.
   That kind of uncertainty made itself evident in the stock market
this past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
Friday at 2,488.61, down 2.23 points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.10 to 171.17;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
5.50 to 341.95, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 1.05 at 291.03.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 147.70 million shares a day,
against 154.29 million the week before.
   The Federal Reserve is widely expected to step up efforts soon
to stimulate the economy through an easing of credit policy. But
many analysts caution that even measures of that kind aren't likely
to work wonders overnight.
   ``Monetary policy should ease, but it will take until at least
mid-1991 for this policy to help the economy,'' said Robert J.
Stalla at the Cleveland-based firm of McDonald &amp; Co. in a recent
commentary. ``Easy money affects the real economy only after a
nine-month lag.''
   In addition, Stalla declared, ``the root of the economic problem
lies mainly inthe financial rather than the real sector. This
means that lower interest rates might be used to shore up the
capital structures of financial intermediaries rather than as an
excuse for liberalizing lending policies.''

   The outlook for the Christmas shopping season went from bad to
worse as the nation's biggest retailers reported dismal sales
results for the month of October.
   Several companies including Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and J.C. Penney
Co. Inc. Thursday said sales dropped from levels of a year earlier
as consumers, with one eye on the economy and the other on the
Middle East, avoided buying anything they didn't need.
   With Christmas less than seven weeks away, neither the retailers
nor the industry analysts who track their performance expect
consumers to suddenly shift gears and go on mammoth gift-buying

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Americans took out a seasonally adjusted $3
billion more in consumer credit than they paid off in September,
the government said.
   Some analysts saw Thursday's report as a further sign of a
consumer spending slowdown, compared to previous years.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Six of the 16 members of a newly appointed
Environmental Protection Agency panel considering the health risks
of second-hand cigarette smoke have ties to a tobacco industry
research organization, documents show.
   A seventh member of the panel was appointed upon the
recommendation of the Philip Morris tobacco company, EPA officials
said.
   ``They've stacked the deck with people who have close ties to
the tobacco industry,'' said Dr. Alan Blum, a founder of the
anti-smoking group Doctors Ought to Care. ``It's pathetic.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - The Hearst Corp. says it has purchased the 20
percent interest in the sports cable television service ESPN Inc.
that had been held by RJR Nabisco Inc. Terms were not disclosed in
the Thursday announcement.
   RJR Nabisco, taken private last year in the biggest
debt-financed takeover on record, had hired an investment adviser
15 months ago to help it evaluate whether to sell the ESPN stake.
Capital Cities-ABC Inc. owns 80 percent of the cable channel and
had the right to match any offer for RJR's interest in ESPN.

   BOSTON (AP) - Groupe Bull, France's state-owned computer maker
with extensive U.S. operations, says it will eliminate more than 10
percent of its work force due to a ``crisis'' facing the world
computer industry.
   Bull said Thursday it would slash 5,000 jobs, including up to
1,000 in Massachusetts where it has extensive operations and its
U.S. headquarters, and 250 in Phoenix.
   Bull also projected it would lose 2.88 billion francs, or about
$511 million, this year.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Officials in New York and Massachusetts have
taken legal action to bar the sale of two junk-bond mutual funds
that allegedly duped 270,000 investors, many of ``very modest
means,'' with tricky sales pitches.
   First Investors, a large mutual fund company targeted in the
suit, denied the charges Thursday, which included scripted and
misleading sales pitches by aggressive representatives seeking to
sign up investors in their own living rooms.
   The company said in a statement it ``will vigorously defend
itself and is confident it will prevail.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Developer Donald Trump, already under heavy
pressure from his creditors, must prove he can cover the monthly
costs of his Trump Palace condominium before any more units are
sold, the state attorney general's office said.
   Trump must produce evidence he can cover the common charges,
real estate taxes and other obligations on the 57-story building at
69th Street and Third Avenue, Richard Barr, a spokesman for
Attorney General Robert Abrams, said Thursday.

   LONDON (AP) - British Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell Group have
announced dramatically higher third-quarter profits, after riding a
sharp rise in crude oil prices prompted by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   British Petroleum Thursday announced third-quarter net profits
of 822 million pounds, or $1.5 billion, nearly a three-fold
increase from the 211 million pounds earned in the same period last
year.

   DETROIT (AP) - Nissan Motor Corp. has recalled about 33,000
1987-1990 model Nissan Vans because of a potential power steering
problem which could result in an engine fire.
   The company said Thursday it was aware of one slight injury
stemming from the problem. The company said a power steering hose
may deteriorate because of engine heat. Fluid then could leak onto
the exhaust manifold, causing a fire.
   Nissan said it would notify owners and perform repairs for free.

<HEAD>Bad October Sales Makes Gloomy Christmas For Retailers More Likely</HEAD>

   Hopes for a successful Christmas shopping season all but
vanished after the nation's biggest retailers said their business
continued to deteriorate in October.
   Several companies including Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and J.C. Penney
Co. Inc. reported Thursday that their sales dropped from levels of
a year earlier as consumers, preoccupied with concerns about the
economy and the Middle East, avoided buying anything they didn't
need.
   The disappointing October sales followed poor showings in August
and September, and with Christmas less than seven weeks away,
retailers and the industry analysts who track their performance
expect consumers to remain frugal during the holiday season.
   ``They'll probaby be going in and buying the same number of
items, but they're not going to pay as much ...'' said Thomas
Tashjian, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles. ``They're not going to buy $100 electronic toys for their
kids, not this year.''
   Analysts said shoppers will be looking harder for bargains and
waiting longer for price reductions than in past years.
   ``They're going to be busy spending fewer dollars,'' said Daniel
Barry, an analyst with Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Consumers cut spending as the economy weakened and after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait raised the specter of war, inflating
prices of gasoline and home heating oil.
   The first items crossed off shopping lists were so-called
discretionary items - clothing, furniture, home appliances and
other extras that are the bread and butter of many big stores.
   If retailers have a difficult Christmas, it could contribute to
a further deterioration of the economy, since two-thirds of the
nation's economic growth is generated by consumer spending.
   Unsold goods on store shelves could also affect manufacturing -
if stores don't place new orders, factories don't need to provide
as many products and could lay off workers.
   And a poor Christmas season could be devastating for the
retailers themselves, as they depend on holiday shopping for about
half their annual sales and profits. Christmas 1989 was a
disappointment for many storeowners after they were forced to slash
prices to attract customers.
   Sears, the country's largest retailer, said October results from
stores open at least one year fell 0.4 percent from a year earlier,
while overall sales dropped 1.2 percent.
   Analysts believe sales from stores open at least a year - also
known as same-store or comparable store sales - provide a more
accurate assessment of a retailer's performance than overall sales
do. New stores tend to have extraordinarily strong sales that can
skew a retailer's results.
   One of the hardest hit last month was Penney, which said
comparable store sales fell 6.3 percent from October 1989, while
overall sales dropped 4.9 percent.
   Limited Inc., the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer,
reported comparable store sales dropped 1 percent as overall sales
rose 13 percent. Apparel stores were also affected by continuing
warm weather in some parts of the country.
   May Department Stores Co., parent of big department store chains
including Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's, said
comparable store sales dropped 4.4 percent, while overall sales
edged up 1.1 percent.
   But Wal-Mart Stores Inc., one of the biggest discount retailers,
continued to outperform the rest of the retail industry, reporting
comparable store sales rose 10 percent while overall sales rose 25
percent.
   Analysts are already predicting trouble for some stores,
especially those going into the Christmas season with high
inventory levels and unexpectedly poor sales. These retailers are
expected to be the first ones to mark down merchandise - and see
their profits evaporate.
   Markdowns set off a spiral of sorts as consumers, having seen
one round of price reductions, wait for more merchandise to be
marked down and end up forcing retailers to take further cuts. When
one retailer lowers prices, it pressures others to follow.
   Among other reports from retailers Thursday:
   -Dayton Hudson Corp. said comparable store sales rose 4.1
percent, while overall sales picked up 16.7 percent.
   -Kmart Corp. reported a 1.3 percent sales gain at comparable
stores, and an 11.2 percent rise overall.
   -Woolworth Corp. said comparable store sales increased 1
percent, while overall sales rose 4.2 percent.
   The results announced Thursday differ from the monthly retail
sales report from the government. The Commerce Department's figures
includes sales from supermarkets, restaurants and car dealers.

   Here are the domestic October sales and sales for the year to
date reported Thursday by some of the nation's largest retailers.
   Many of the major companies have agreed to issue their monthly
results on the same date, similar to the practice in past years.
Monthly results had been released on different days earlier this
year.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales on a monthly basis,
including R.H. Macy &amp; Co. And, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., a privately
held retailer, has discontinued releasing its monthly sales.
Reporting periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same
fiscal year.

<HEAD>High-Tech Companies Compete to Create Faster Supercomputers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As competition heats up to make the
speediest computers to solve the biggest problems in science, Intel
Corp. is poised to introduce what the company says is the world's
fastest supercomputer.
   Supercomputer fever, spurred on by Pentagon funding in many
cases, is getting hotter as researchers look for ways to apply the
machines that can speed up medical research and help create
``smart'' bombs, among other uses.
   ``If we can make microprocessors smaller and faster, they would
be very useful for advanced weapons systems,'' Pentagon spokeswoman
Jan Bodanyi said Thursday. ``They will be the ultimate weapons
system. ... Once we get supercomputers down to soup-can size we can
put them on missiles.''
   Industry analysts warn, however, that despite the push to create
supercomputers that can handle more information at one time and at
mind-boggling speeds, the real challenges are to harness that
power, to maintain top speeds and to make the systems even smaller
and cheaper.
   ``There aren't many people out there who can afford to pay $25
million to $30 million for a top of the line supercomputer,'' said
Christopher Willard, senior industry analyst at San Jose-based
DataQuest. ``Another problem is actually getting and using the full
power of the highly parallel computers. It's hard to deliver and
sustain the full power.''
   Officials at Santa Clara-based Intel have refused to release
information on the company's new supercomputer before a formal
announcement at an industry conference in New York on Tuesday. The
California Institute of Technology at Pasadena, where the
supercomputer will be installed, also has refused to comment.
   Intel, which invented the microprocessor, is an industry leader
in chip design and manufacture. Its new supercomputer will use 512
of the company's powerful i860 chips. Now, Intel's most powerful
machine uses 128 of those chips.
   A parallel system links separate microprocessors to create the
supercomputer, which in Intel's case would reportedly reach speeds
of up to 32 GigaFLOPs, or 32 billion floating-point operations per
second - the customary measure of a computer's ability to crunch
numbers and information.
   Skeptics, including Intel's competitors NCube of Beaverton,
Ore., and Cray Research Inc. of Minneapolis, wonder if the new
machine can actually reach that computation speed even for simple
problems.
   ``No supercomputer can maintain that type of speed,'' said
Charles Grasfl, marketing analyst for Cray, which dominates the
supercomputer market. ``I want to know what it can do. Where's the
breakthrough?''
   One analyst compared supercomputers to using 10,000 rabbits to
plow a field instead of four horses; the rabbits may have more
total energy, but controlling that power is difficult. Still,
scientists continue to try.
   ``What's fascinating about supercomputers is what people will be
able to achieve one day,'' said Abbie Kendall, spokeswoman for
NCube. ``Right now we're on the edge of technology.''
   In mid-1989, NCube introduced its supercomputer, which at 27
GigaFLOP was the world's fastest. The company is working on a
quicker model.
   The Intel supercomputer will reportedly be used for research,
including study of how to better apply such huge computer brains.
   ``Supercomputers still have a long way to go in terms of use for
the average programmer,'' said DataQuest's Willard. ``The
application, I think, will come from not what the system's top
configuration can do but with what its smaller chunks can
accomplish.
   ``Now, the marketplace is limited to universities, military,
NASA ... What they need to do is some supercomputing for more
mundane uses.''
   NCube hasn't sold its top-of-the-line, $20 million supercomputer
yet, but Kendall said the private company expects to sell one by
mid-1991.
   Now, she said, NCube sells smaller parallel systems that can do
more work faster than regular computers. A drug company, for
example, gets results in three to four hours about molecule
configurations for new manufactured drugs instead of the three
months such a computation took previously.

   Wholesale prices were still climbing three
months after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait jolted world oil markets but
- absent a shooting war - they should begin to moderate soon, many
analysts believe.
   The Aug. 2 invasion wrecked many economists' prediction that
inflation would ease this year. Oil prices doubled from an average
of around $20 a barrel in July.
   Overwhelmed by the shock, the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index, which measures the prices paid by manufacturers, farmers and
other producers, took off.
   It shot up 1.3 percent in August and 1.6 percent in September
for the biggest two-month increase in a decade.
   In advance of today's report on the index for October, most
economists were expecting a rise of about 0.7 percent. Although
much milder, that's still worrisomely high. If continued for 12
consecutive months, it would produce annual wholesale inflation of
8.7 percent.
   But better times are ahead unless war disrupts oil supplies
further, analysts said. Crude oil prices, although jumpy, have
settled back to around $35 a barrel from highs of $40.
   ``The worst of the oil shock is going to be past after this
month's data. Of course there could be a war at any moment and that
would change the outlook,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of
Merrill Lynch Inc.
   Wholesale prices overall increased at a 6.3 percent annual rate
during the first nine months of 1990, sharply higher than the 4.8
percent gain for all of last year.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University predicted
a 1990 increase in the Producer Price Index of only 3.1 percent.
   Ratajczak and Steinberg both foresaw some ripple effects from
higher oil prices into related items, particularly those with heavy
transportation costs. But they said the economic slowdown, which
many analysts say has just about deepened into a recession, will
subdue those effects.
   ``In general, the inflation outlook is improving,'' Steinberg
said. ``The reason is simple: if you have a recession, inflation
goes down. It always works. Since I believe we're having a
recession, I believe inflation will come down.''
   Steinberg said demand is just too weak and sales too slow for
businesses to pass on most of their increased energy costs.
   Michael Boskin, chief economic adviser to President Bush, argued
that the runup in petroleum prices will be less destructive now
than during previous oil shocks in 1973 and 1979.
   ``No. 1, thus far the price increase has been substantially less
than the .. increases of the 1970s. (And) in proportionate terms,
we use one-third less energy ... than we used to,'' Boskin told the
American Council for Capital Formation.
   ``Once the Middle Eastern situation resolves itself, obviously
oil prices are going to come down,'' he said.
   Economist Samuel Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. said the break in
inflation should provide the Federal Reserve with an opportunity to
stimulate the economy with lower interest rates.
   He predicted a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate, the
rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, to 7{ percent by
early December.
   ``The economy looks like it's weakening and I think they want to
provide the cushion to prevent it from becoming a sliding
collapse,'' Kahan said.

   The health insurance industry will be an
``irresistible target'' as Congress sets out anew next year to try
to rein in the costs of medical care, a key senator says.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the attractiveness of
further regulating private insurers is that doing so would not cost
the federal government any money.
   ``You talk about an irresistible target - a nice plump turkey
sitting on the table at Thanksgiving time - that's it,''
Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Finance subcommittee on
Medicare and long term care, said Thursday.
   And as evidence that Congress has the will to make such changes,
he noted that lawmakers included in the deficit-reduction package
passed last month new limits on companies selling private
``medigap'' insurance policies, which pick up where Medicare leaves
off.
   ``It was very, very easy'' to get bipartisan agreement on the
changes, which among other things, require these companies to pay
65 cents in benefits for every dollar of premiums and to guarantee
that policies are renewable, Rockefeller said.
   If private insurers do not change their ways and make a
contribution to controlling the cost of health care, Congress will
do it for them, he said.
   ``If they bring Congress a proposal that continues to permit
insurance companies to deny coverage and charge widely varying
premiums based on health status, they will be making an egregious
error,'' Rockefeller said.
   ``That will send the message that their industry intends to
pursue business as usual,'' he told a media forum on health care
issues.
   However, Rockefeller also said ``the health insurance industry
is working very hard'' to satisfy Congress.
   Indeed, James Dorsch, Washington counsel for the Health
Insurance Association of America, said ``we know the status quo
can't continue.'' To that end, he said, the association has offered
several proposals to Congress to make health insurance more
accessible to small employers.
   Some of these changes have been enacted in Connecticut, he said.
The association is working with other states ``and we will be back
to Congress next year,'' Dorsch said.
   He also said insurance companies have been making strides to
contain health care costs through ``managed care'' programs, in
which insurers attempt to assure that effective care is being
delivered.
   Americans will pay more than $600 billion this year for health
care.
   Still, more than 30 million people have no health insurance and
do not qualify for public programs. Many are forced to rely on
hospital emergency rooms for conditions that could have been
prevented with earlier care or could be delivered more efficiently
and inexpensively in a doctor's office.
   Rockefeller headed the bipartisan Pepper Commission, which last
March recommended a $66 billion public-private plan to provide
health care to nearly all Americans. It also included some
insurance industry changes.
   The senator said he and other lawmakers of both parties are
starting to draft some of those insurance changes into a
legislative bill.
   He said that any proposals the industry offer will have ``to
have to adhere to standards that are very close or exactly what the
Pepper Commission recommended.''
   These would prohibit private insurers from denying coverage for
pre-existing conditions and require them to accept anyone who wants
insurance and to set rates on the same terms to all groups in an
area.
   ``We're basically going to have to get that far to have true
health insurance reform,'' Rockefeller said.
   If by the end of the decade the health care crisis persists, the
American people will lose confidence in the current public-private
system ``and we will go to national health insurance,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission says
it's taking aim at toy-based television programs, but critics claim
the agency's action misses the mark.
   The commission on Thursday proposed a new definition of a
``program-length commercial,'' which is what critics say makes up
much of children's TV.
   The critics cite the likes of ``He-Man'' and ``G.I. Joe,''
saying these programs are thinly disguised, 30-minute sales pitches
that drive out quality kids' shows. They have urged the FCC to put
the brakes on such shows.
   But the FCC won't go that far.
   ``The mere fact that a story line ... is built around a toy
being sold on the market would not make it a program-length
commercial,'' Regina Harrison, an attorney in the FCC's mass media
bureau, said after the FCC voted 5-0 to adopt a new definition of
program-length commercials.
   Harrison added that the commission was ``twisting and turning
trying to reach a definition that won't cut out shows'' such as
``Sesame Street.''
   The FCC, under orders from Congress to complete a 3-year-old
investigation into toy-based programs, proposed to define
program-length commercials as any children's show ``associated with
a product in which commercials for that product are aired.''
   Previously, the commission defined program-length commercials as
material ``so interwoven with, and in essence auxiliary to, the
sponsor's advertising'' that the entire program is, in effect, a
commercial. The FCC said Thursday that the new definition
``appeared to be in harmony with the traditional definition.''
   But Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television
in Cambridge, Mass., said the FCC was trying to adopt a definition
that would avoid the issue of programs promoting toys.
   She said toy manufacturers don't put commercials into shows on
which their toys are based because kids tend not to notice the ads.
   ``The commercial gets lost,'' she said in a telephone interview.
A G.I. Joe commercial, for instance, ``sticks out much better in
`My Little Pony,''' she added.
   The commission invited public comment on what penalties, if any,
should be imposed on program-length commercials. It may decide that
such programs violate new advertising time limits that Congress
also ordered the FCC to impose as part of the Children's Television
Act of 1990.
   The commission on Thursday also proposed to implement the ad
time limits: 10.5 minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and
12 minutes per hour on weekdays on kids' shows, including cable TV.
Violations of the rules, to take effect in April, could lead to
fines ranging from $25,000 to $250,000.
   The commission lifted similar restrictions in 1984, and Congress
later was told that advertising on some programs increased to 14
minutes per hour. A federal appeals court in 1987 ordered the FCC
to reconsider its decision.
   The commission also said it will consider during license renewal
whether a station has provided programs specifically designed to
meet the educational and informational needs of children.
   President Bush, citing First Amendment concerns, allowed the
measure to become law last month without his signature.
   The commission said children would be defined as age 12 or under
for advertising purposes. For programming, it said it would
consider expanding the limit above 12, which critics argue would
make it too easy for broadcasters to claim they were meeting the
needs of kids.
   The commission also said that besides a station's own kids'
programs, it also would consider at license renewal a station's
non-programming actions - giving money to support public TV
educational programs, for example.

<HEAD>Plan to Save Philadelphia from Bankruptcy Includes Local Sales Tax</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: News conference not expected until afternoon. Lede prospects
uncertain. Also moving on general news wires.</NOTE>

   A plan to save Philadelphia from bankruptcy
would plug a short-term cash shortage and address a projected
$206.4 million deficit this year in the city's general fund budget.
   The plan scheduled to be unveiled this afternoon was also
expected to contain such measures as a 1 percent local sales tax,
spending cuts, sale of city-owned assets and a financial oversight
mechanism outside city government.
   To avert the cash shortage, the long-awaited plan reportedly
includes short-term borrowing of up to $350 million from the city's
$1.5 billion pension fund, state treasury and local banks.
   State House Speaker Robert W. O'Donnell said he expects to
announce the plan today along with Mayor W. Wilson Goode and other
leaders. He said many of the plan's details could change once they
reach lawmakers.
   ``What we've done is go down into details far enough to get a
sense that it can be done, without specifying as part of the
agreement that this is the way it will be done,'' he said Thursday.
The sales tax, for example, could end up being another type of tax,
as long as it accomplishes the same goal, he said.
   City Council members, however, have denounced the package as
vague and inadequate, The Philadelphia Inquirer said in today's
editions.
   The city's short-term cash shortage has threatened to force a
halt in payments next month to city vendors and employees. The plan
would address that problem and look at long-term problems
contributing to the deficit in the city's $2.19 billion general
fund budget.
   Officials also have sought higher state support for court costs
and for prorams that serve abused and neglected children.
   The city needs money to tide the city over until spring, when
major tax payments are due. In September, the city was snubbed by
Wall Street when it tried to float $375 million in temporary loan
notes.
   Bond-rating agencies have lowered the city's debt to the lowest
among major U.S. cities. They have urged city and state leaders to
cooperate to find permanent solutions.
   Philadelphia is not the only city in the state with fiscal woes.
In Scranton, a court denial of the city's request to float a $4.5
million bond issue may put half of the 650 municipal employees out
of work Monday, city officials there said Thursday.
   Scranton Mayor James Connors said the city, which had to win
court approval because the money would be used for payroll
expenses, now has only enough money to meet its payroll this week.

<HEAD>Judge Dumps Part of Lawsuit But Leaves State Wage Claims Against
Nordstrom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed part of a Washington state
lawsuit against fashion retailer Nordstrom Inc., but left intact
the state's effort to collect back wages for employees who claim
they were coerced into working unpaid overtime.
   The state Department of Labor and Industries in February found
that Nordstrom had violated state labor laws by failing to pay some
employees for such things as attending company meetings, writing
customer thank you notes and making deliveries.
   Nordstrom admitted there were some errors in tracking employee
time and established a $15 million reserve to pay workers. But the
company denied deliberate violations of wage and hour laws. It sued
Labor and Industries, contending the department's findings denied
them due process.
   The state countersued in April, and asked that Nordstrom be
forced to pay damages double the amount of money owed workers. That
amount has not been determined.
   Acting on a motion by Nordstrom to dismiss the department's
lawsuit, King County Superior Court Judge Susan Agid on Thursday
ruled the state couldn't collect damages or constrain the way
Nordstrom pays its employees in the future.
   But Agid upheld the department's efforts to collect back pay for
perhaps hundreds of Nordstrom employees in Washington state that
Labor and Industries contends were coerced to work without pay.
   ``We certainly were pleased with where the judge went with her
ruling,'' Nordstrom spokesman Dave Marriott said. ``The state was
seeking pretty broad authority.''
   Jim Robart, an attorney for Nordstrom, called Agid's decision
``a major victory.''
   ``We were unable to get everything tossed out today, but we were
able to get three-quarters of it,'' he said.
   State attorneys indicated they may appeal.
   Without the ability to seek injunctions, Labor and Industries
would have the power only to enforce labor laws ``after the damage
has been done,'' said Paul Triesch, assistant state attorney
general. The limitation on damages also reduced the leverage the
department can wield to enforce its findings, Triesch said.
   Agid's ruling was the latest in a series of decisions stemming
from various legal actions filed by the state, Nordstrom and the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. UFCW is bargaining agent
for about 2,000 Nordstrom workers, although fewer than half belong
to the union.
   Last week, National Labor Relations Board lawyers rejected
appeals by UFCW Local 1001 to overturn settlements between the
retail clothing chain and the federal agency.
   In the settlements, Nordstrom had agreed to post notices
promising not to penalize employees for union activity, not to
bargain with workers directly rather than through the union and not
to withhold information rightfully sought by the union for
negotiations.
   After the notices have been posted for 60 days, the chain may be
found in compliance with the settlement, said John Nelson, NLRB
regional director.
   At that point, Nordstrom employees could begin circulating
petitions for an election on whether to retain the union, but Local
1001 president Joe Peterson said the decertification effort would
be blocked by new unfair labor practice charges to be filed within
two weeks.
   Nordstrom has about five dozen stores in Washington state,
Oregon, California, Utah, Alaska, Virginia, and New Jersey.
   Its dispute with the union arose 1{ years ago during contract
talks covering sales clerks in five stores in Seattle and one in
Tacoma. Nordstrom negotiators refused to accept renewal of a
provision that required employees covered by the contract to belong
to the union and the contract expired July 31, 1989.
   Last winter the union sued, seeking more than $300 million in
back pay for about 30,000 Nordstrom employees nationwide.
   A separate but similar union complaint resulted in the state
Department of Labor and Industries' ruling in February and its
subsequent countersuit against the company.
   Also pending is a federal lawsuit by three stockholders who said
the labor battle had cost them financial losses and claimed company
officers failed to disclose those problems.

   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. posted a
profit of $56.9 million in the third quarter, citing lower interest
expense, cost savings and improved book sales.
   The earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 amounted to 73
cents a share compared with a loss of $85.8 million, or $1.41 a
share, a year ago.
   The 1989 results were lowered by $127 million in write-offs.
   Revenue for the third quarter totaled $476.5 million, up 1.4
percent from $470.1 million in the same quarter last year.
   The book publisher and insurance company has been contending
with a heavy debt burden ever since it fought off a hostile
takeover bid by British publisher Robert Maxwell in 1987. The
company borrowed heavily to finance the battle, laid off 10 percent
of its workforce and sold its theme parks to Anheuser-Busch Inc.
   Last week, HBJ announced that it hired the New York-based firm
of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. Inc. for financial advice on
dealing with HBJ's debt of more than $1.7 billion.
   For the first nine months, Harcourt said it lost $38.0 million,
or 73 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $244.4 million, or
$4.05 a share a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 5.8 percent to $1.10 billion from $1.04
billion.

   The stock market headed higher today amid
persistent hopes for a more generous credit policy at the Federal
Reserve.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.13 to
2,455.94 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 632 up, 342 down and

   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 1.1 percent in October, slightly

   That gave investors some hope that the Federal Reserve would see
more leeway to relax its credit policy in the near future,
promoting lower interest rates.
   On Thursday the Treasury completed a three-day auction of a

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel Cutting Price Hike</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from analyst, USX</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp., reacting to weak
conditions in the steel market, said it would cut in half an 8
percent price increase scheduled for sheet steel shipments after
Dec. 29.
   The move is expected to be followed by other major steelmakers,
who have announced similar price increases in an effort to shore up
eroding profits.
   ``This action is being taken to better reflect the realities of
the marketplace,'' Bethlehem spokesman Henry H. Von Spreckelsen
said Thursday.
   The sheet steel - used for autos, appliances and construction
materials - is produced at Bethlehem Steel's Burns Harbor, Ind.,
and Sparrows Point, Md., plants.
   The original price hike was announced in September, but
customers asked for a reprieve, Von Spreckelsen said.
   ``At an appropriate time in months ahead, customers can expect
an additional increase to offset rising costs,'' he said.
   A USX spokesman declined to say whether the nation's No. 1 steel
maker would follow Bethlehem's lead. However, Charles Bradford, a
steel analyst with UBS Securities in New York, said USX and other
steel makers have little choice.
   He said the 8 percent increases announced by steel makers ``were
kind of joke in the first place.''
   ``I don't think too many people really expected to get that
much,'' he said. ``But if you don't ask for more you don't get
anything.''
   Bradford said steel makers need price relief to cover increased
costs and wage hikes that go into effect Jan. 1.
   Bethlehem Steel reported earnings of $53.3 million for the first
nine months of 1990, compared to earnings of $195.7 million in the
same period of 1989.
   Under the new schedule, the price increase on hot-rolled steel
would be lowered to $20 from $35 a ton, on cold-rolled steel to $25
from $47 a ton and on galvanized steel to $30 from $49 a ton.

   Wholesale prices in October soared for the
third consecutive month, the government said today, as the fear of
war in the Persian Gulf kept energy costs rising.
   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index for finished
goods, one stop short of retail, jumped 1.1 percent last month
after rising 1.6 percent in September and 1.3 percent in August.
   The three-month jolt brought producer price inflation for the
first 10 months of 1990 to a 7 percent annual rate. That's sharply
higher than the 4.9 percent rate for all of last year is the worst
since prices soared 7.1 percent in 1981.
   If wholesale inflation were to continue at the October rate for
12 consecutive months, the annual rate would be 13.7 percent.
   However, most economists expect energy inflation to moderate
soon, barring the outbreak of war in the Middle East or if Saudi
Arabian oil production facilities manage to survive a short war
relatively intact.
   In October, as in August and September, energy prices led the
index higher, rising 8 percent compared with a 0.9 percent increase
for food - the worst since January - and no net change in the
prices of all other items.
   Still, it was better than the 13.8 percent rise in energy costs
in September and the 9.5 percent increase a month before that.
   As temperatures across much of the North turned chillier, fuel
oil prices rose 15 percent and were 67.5 percent higher than a year
earlier. Natural gas costs, however, edged down 0.3 percent.
   Gasoline prices increased 8 percent, bringing the level to 50.2
percent higher than a year before.
   Food prices, meanwhile, turned significantly higher, led by a
9.5 percent increase for eggs, an 8.2 percent rise for pork and a
5.1 percent advance for beef and veal and turkeys. Costs also rose
for vegetables and pasta.
   The increases were only partly offset by declines in the prices
of fresh fruit, rice, chickens, fish, dairy products, coffee and
cooking oils.
   Economists were encouraged by the lack of inflation outside the
volatile food and energy sectors, taking it as a sign that the
sluggish economy is keeping a lid on price pressures.
   The so-called core rate of inflation, excluding food and energy,
is considered a better barometer of underlying inflation trends.
   ``The good news is the bad news could have been much worse,''
said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors. ``The overall report is much higher than
expected, but the good news is that core prices remain unchanged.''
   The price of passenger cars fell 2.7 percent. Other declines
were recorded for men's and boy's clothing, floor coverings and
household flatware.
   Prices rose 3.4 percent for newspapers and were also up for
books, sanitary papers, women's clothing, cosmetics, tobacco and
jewelry.
   The various changes left the Producer Price index for all
finished goods at 122.3 in October. That means that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 cost $122.30 last month, up
from $114.70 a year earlier.
   Inflation at earlier stages of the production process was also
up sharply, driven by energy. Prices rose 1.5 percent for
intermediate goods and 8.7 percent for crude goods. But, excluding
energy and food, prices rose only 0.4 percent at the intermediate
level and fell 1.7 percent at the crude level.
   Crude petroleum prices jumped 29.2 percent in October and were
double the level of a year ago.
   An example of the three processing stages would be bread for
finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.
   Economist Samuel Kahan of Fuji Securities Inc. predicted a
quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge
each other for overnight loans, to 7{ percent by early December.
   ``The economy looks like it's weakening and I think they want to
provide the cushion to prevent it from becoming a sliding
collapse,'' Kahan said.

   Two government agencies are expected to seek up
to $10 billion against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. for alleged
fraud in junk bond dealings with several savings and loans, sources
said today.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust
Corp. have until next Thursday to file claims against the collapsed
Wall Street firm now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   The filings are expected to seek from $5 billion to $10 billion
for losses incurred by several major savings and loans from
investments in high-yield securities marketed by Drexel, people
with knowledge of the agencies' plans said.
   The total is expected to reflect a tripling of damages based an
allegations of antitrust law violations, people involved in the
talks said. The FDIC insures deposits for the nation's savings and
loans while Resolution Trust oversees the federal thrift bailout.
   Lawyers for Drexel and investors, ex-clients and government
agencies are negotiating over the total compensation to be alloted
in Drexel's bankruptcy court reorganization. About 100 civil
securities fraud lawsuits nationwide are outstanding.
   The claims allege stock manipulation, racketeering, insider
trading and numerous other crimes by Drexel and its junk-bond
department led by convicted financier Michael Milken. Litigated
separately, they would take 10 years or more to resolve.
   Instead, attorneys plan to negotiate an estimate of maximum
damages Drexel should pay. A figure would have to be approved by
U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack and would be included in a
reorganization plan to pay Drexel creditors.
   ``It's a major stumbling block to the plan,'' Drexel lawyer Alan
Miller said. ``You have to figure out how much you owe, how high is
up. And you have to figure out how to get it done in our
lifetime.''
   Final damage awards will likely be only a fraction of the
billions of dollars being sought because of Drexel's limited
assets, lawyers said.
   The claims include class actions by shareholders of companies
that did business with Drexel or whose securities were affected by
Drexel deals, individual firms and federal agencies.
   The negotiations do not cover 200 arbitration disputes and
another 100 lawsuits alleging wrongdoing other than securities
fraud, which also must be addressed in the bankruptcy.
   Drexel already has agreed to pay $350 million into a civil
restitution fund to compensate investors harmed by its actions. The
Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to recover $150
million Drexel still owes the fund, which was formed as part of its
1989 guilty plea to six felony crimes.
   If the civil litigation settlement exceeds $350 million - which
is likely - Drexel will be liable for the rest. The litigation
automatically came to a halt when Drexel filed for Chapter 11 on
Feb. 13.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Conrad recently also froze lawsuits
naming current and former Drexel employees but not the firm. Most
of those claims involve Milken, to be sentenced next week on his
guilty plea to six trading-related felony counts.
   Drexel lawyers requested that freeze on grounds a liability
finding against a Drexel employee could be binding on the firm.
Also, information discovered in preparing civil cases against
outside parties could turn up evidence against Drexel.
   ``If Mike Milken said `I didn't do it but Drexel did,' he has
now accomplished what the plaintiffs wanted to accomplish,'' Miller
said.
   That's not an unlikely scenario. During a special court hearing
on unadmitted charges against Milken, his lawyers said in one case
that a stock was manipulated and Milken didn't do it - but someone
else at Drexel did.
   But Richard Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel, said the
freeze is delaying compensation to investors in cases only
indirectly related to the Drexel bankruptcy.
   ``You have ... victims of securities fraud who can't collect
money because Drexel is taking its sweet time figuring out how to
shape up its own affairs,'' he said Thursday. ``If a plaintiff can
prove a case against Mike Milken he ought to be able to collect
against Mike Milken.''
   Melvyn Weiss, lead attorney in 16 fraud lawsuits, said lawyers
were hamstrung by the freeze but developing their cases as much as
possible pending a ruling by Judge Pollack.
   A reorganization plan would establish how much Drexel's
creditors receive when the firm emerges from bankruptcy and whether
unsecured creditors, such as former employees who owned company
stock, get anything.
   Drexel currently is paying only operating expenses on a
300-person staff, down from more than 10,000 at its peak. A total
of 19 Drexel-related entities are involved in the bankruptcy. Legal
fees in the first three months of the case totaled nearly $4.7
million.
   About 15 Drexel professionals are managing the firm's junk-bond
portfolio but not selling many securities because of the market's
collapse. The bulk of Drexel staff handles bankruptcy-related
administrative and financial matters.
   Drexel has vacated all but 130,000 of 1.5 million square feet of
office space. Almost all remaining employees are at the firm's New
York headquarters, with a handful at a small Los Angeles office.

   A bumper corn harvest this fall is leading the
way for the largest total crop output by American farmers in five
years, the Agriculture Department says.
   The 1990 corn harvest was estimated Thursday at a four-year high
of 7.93 billion bushels, up 5 percent from last year, although down
slightly from prospects in October.
   An all-crops production index was reported at 112 percent of its
1977 average used for comparison. That was up one percentage point
from October and the highest reading since the index averaged 116
percent in 1985.
   The latest corn production outlook, based on Nov. 1 indications,
was down 1 percent from USDA's October forecast. The harvest was
about 64 percent completed by Oct. 28, slightly behind normal.
   ``Many growers continue to report yields lower than previously
anticipated,'' the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said.
``Ears in late-planted fields in Indiana did not fill out. Corn
borers also did considerable damage in Illinois.''
   Farmers harvested 7.53 billion bushels in 1989, and the
department in its initial 1990 forecast on Aug. 9 put this fall's
harvest at 7.85 billion bushels.
   The forecast was raised on Sept. 12 to 8.12 billion bushels and
then lowered to 8.02 billion on Oct. 11.
   At 7.93 billion bushels, this year's harvest still would be the
largest since farmers produced 8.23 billion bushels in 1986,
according to USDA records.
   Based on the latest surveys, the average corn yield nationally
was estimated at 119 bushels per acre harvested, compared with
116.2 last year and 120.3 indicated last month. The record was
119.4 bushels in 1987.
   As livestock feed, corn is the largest and most important U.S.
farm crop and is essential for the production of meat, poultry and
dairy products.
   Consumer food prices, which rose an average of 5.8 percent in
1989, the sharpest year-to-year increase since 1981, are expected
to climb an additional 5 percent to 7 percent in 1990.
   Soybean production, a source of high-protein meal and vegetable
oil, was estimated at 1.9 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last
year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels but 4 percent more than the
October forecast of 1.82 billion bushels.
   Cotton production was indicated at 14.9 million bales, up 22
percent from last year's output of 12.2 million bales and 2 percent
more than the October forecast.
   No new estimates of 1990 production of wheat and other crops
harvested earlier were included in the report.
   The fall crop of potatoes was estimated for the first time this
season at 342 million hundredweight, up 5 percent from last year
due to an increase in acreage. Average yields were forecast at 298
hundredweight per acre, down one hundredweight from 1989.
   ``Drought in North Dakota and Minnesota cut into production
potential for the third straight year,'' the report said. ``Maine
farmers were hit by heavy October rains, followed by hard freezes
late in the month that virtually shut down harvest operations.''
   The potato outlook also was said to be hurt by ``extremely
variable temperatures'' in Idaho, Oregon and Washington during the
growing season.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, analysts said total corn
use in the 1990-91 marketing year that began Sept. 1 is expected to
be about 8.045 billion bushels.
   With use exceeding estimated production, the U.S. corn stockpile
may decline to a projected 1.236 billion bushels by Sept. 1, 1991,
compared with 1.344 billion this Sept. 1.
   The report said corn prices at the farm may average $2.20 to
$2.60 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, down from $2.36 in
1989-90 and unchanged from the October projection.
   Soybean prices were indicated to average $5.35 to $6.35 per
bushel, down from the October range of $5.70 to $7 per bushel.
   This fall's larger than expected crop is putting pressure on
prices and will mean a rise in soybean stockpiles in 1990-91. By
next Sept. 1, the report said, soybean inventories could be around
255 million bushels, compared with 239 million bushels this Sept. 1
and last month's projection of 175 million bushels next year.
   The report also showed the Soviet Union's grain harvest at 235
million metric tons this year, unchanged from the October forecast.
However, analysts said Soviet grain imports in 1990-91 now are
expected to be 28 million tons, down from 30 million anticipated
last month.
   Other 1990 crop estimates based on Nov. 1 indications, compared
with 1989 output, included:
   -Sorghum, 559.8 million bushels and an average yield of 60.5
bushels per acre, compared with 617.9 million and 55.4 in 1989.
   -Rice, 154.4 million hundredweight and a yield of 5,499 pounds
per acre, compared with 154.5 million and 5,749.
   -Peanuts, 3.45 billion pounds and a yield of 1,949 pounds per
acre, compared with 3.99 billion and 2,426.
   -Tobacco, 1.6 billion pounds and a yield of 2,198 pounds per
acre, compared with 1.37 billion and 2,016.
   -Sugar beets, 27 million tons and a yield of 19.7 tons per acre,
compared with 25.1 million and 19.4.
   -Sugar cane, 25.3 million tons and a yield of 35.3 tons per
acre, compared with 29.4 million and 34.5.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Plunge on Big Crop Forecast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply this morning
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government raised its 1990
harvest estimate by more than 4 percent to a higher-than-expected
1.9 billion bushels.
   Wheat and corn futures also opened lower despite a lower corn
crop estimate in Thursday's monthly Agriculture Department crop
report.
   Most analysts had expected the USDA's increase in its soybean
projection to about 1.84 billion bushels from last month's estimate
of 1.82 billion.
   The government also raised its estimate of how large the U.S.
soybean stockpile will be next Aug. 31, the end of the current
marketing year, to 255 million bushels from 175 million.
   That projection reversed the USDA's October prediction that the
soybean stockpile would shrink from last August's carryout of 239
million bushels.
   ``Not only is it adequate but it starts to border on
burdensome,'' said Doug Jackson, grains analyst with Farmers
Commodities Corp. in Des Moines, Iowa.
   The USDA lowered its corn production estimate from 8 billion to
7.9 billion bushels, but selling pressure for the soybean pit
overshadowed that ostensibly bullish factor at the opening.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.68 a bushel; corn
was unchanged to { cent lower with December at $2.32} a bushel;
oats were { cent to } cent lower with December at $1.21 a bushel;
soybeans were 10 cents lower to 1 cent higher with November at
$5.73{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were higher and pork futures lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent higher with December at
77.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .40 cent higher
with November at 87.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to
.52 cent lower with December at 52.55 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .03 cent to .45 cent lower with February at 68.80
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond issues that would have borrowed billions of
dollars to preserve open spaces and clean the environment went the
way of plastic foam hamburger boxes this past week.
   Voters in New York state Tuesday rejected a $1.9 billion bond
package that would have spent most of its money to buy and set
aside Adirondack woodland and establish solid-waste programs. In
California the ``Big Green'' environmental proposal, which would
have raised money for forest protection, such as $300 million to
buy stands of ancient redwoods, was defeated.
   ``People first and foremost are concerned with economic
events,'' said Neal Atterman, municipal research director at
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``Look at consumer confidence, then put that
into a voting booth connotation. People don't want radical changes
right now.''
   California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, a primary sponsor
of the environmental measure there, also said voters were showing a
move toward fiscal conservatism.
   ``I think the invasion of Kuwait, the beginning of the
recession, the national budget crisis, the state budget crisis -
all those things have scared people,'' he said.
   Environmental issues weren't the only bond questions turned
away. Voters rejected 43.5 percent of the proposed bond issues,
amounting to 59.5 percent of the total dollar value of bonds on
Tuesday's ballot, according to The Bond Buyer, the municipal bond
market daily newspaper.
   Voters approved 242 state and local government bond issues
totaling $4.887 billion out of 428 issues totaling 12.067 billion,
The Bond Buyer reported. The percentage of approvals was the lowest
in a general election since 10 percent were approved in 1975, the
newspaper said.
   In last year's general election, 85.7 percent of the $6.68
billion of bond issues on ballots were approved.
   ``A lot of it is probably related to the economy. It may also be
related to the federal tax increase. People think we can't afford
to borrow,'' said Claire Cohen, head of government finance at Fitch
Investors Service Inc., a bond rating agency.
   Other analysts, like George Friedlander, head of municipal
research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said the heavy
rejection of bond issues this year was a sign voters didn't trust
political leaders to spend the money wisely.
   Bonds that would have funded affordable housing and public
facilities were turned away, but voters were more receptive to
issues for education, health care and transportation.
   In Massachusetts, voters rejected a plan that would have cut tax
revenues by $1.35 billion this fiscal year.
   ``I think that what's going on is very positive,'' Atterman
said. ``Voters are concerned about the future and want to keep
public debt lower rather than higher.''
   Analysts said voters showed they were selective about the issues
they approved, with California voters giving the go-ahead to $800
million school construction issue and defeating more than
three-fourths of the $5.279 billion worth of proposed bonds.
   The heavy drubbing bonds took should not have a major impact on
the already short-supply municipal bond market, Friedlander said.
   The vast majority of municipal bonds are not decided at
elections, he said.

   The National plans to discontinue its Sunday
issue next month and publish five rather than six days a week, the
editor in chief of the nine-month-old sports daily said today.
   Editor Frank Deford also said there may be ``a handful'' of jobs
cut at the newspaper but that he was hopeful the number would be so
small that it could be absorbed through attrition rather than
layoffs.
   ``There is a feeling that as in practically every other business
in America we should tighten our belts,'' Deford said in a
telephone interview.
   Deford denied that the newspaper was in serious financial
trouble as it tries to become the first national sports daily in
America. ``it's just a matter of belt-tightening,'' he said.
   On Thursday, a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said
the Sunday issue was being discontinued because circulation on
Sundays has amounted to only about 80 percent of that on weekdays
and it has proven harder to distribute the paper on Sundays than on
weekdays.
   The National has been published six days a week, Sunday through
Friday, since it was launched on Jan. 31.
   Deford said the last Sunday issue will be published on the
Sunday after Thanksgiving.
   The newspaper is owned by a partnership led by Mexican media
baron Emilio Azcarraga. Repeated calls seeking comment were made to
Publisher Peter O. Price but they were not returned.
   The paper started out with editions in three markets - New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles - but six other markets have been added
since then.
   The other editions are in San Diego, San Francisco, Dallas,
Detroit, Boston and Miami. The newsapaper has announced plans to
begin another edition in the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area
in early December and an edition in Philadelphia in January.
   The newspaper's arrival was met with considerable skepticism
about whether there are enough readers and advertisers to support a
daily newspaper devoted exclusively to sports.
   The launch also coincided with a sharp decline in the
advertising market for newspapers in many parts of the country that
has shown no signs of abating.
   But Azcarraga and his partners reportedly went into the
enterprise prepared to spend $100 million and several years in
making the newspaper profitable.
   The source who told of the plans to end the Sunday edition said
the decision was not a sign that the paper was in danger of
folding.
   ``My sense of it is that it is a very viable concern,'' he said.
   He said ending the Sunday issue was part of the ``normal
shakedown'' that occurs in finding a sensible production schedule.

<HEAD>Figure in Silverado Debacle Claims $196 Million in Debts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Denver developer Bill Walters, who defaulted on $106
million in loans from Silverado Savings and Loan, has filed for
personal bankruptcy in Santa Ana, Calif., claiming $196 million in
debts.
   Nathan Jones, a San Diego attorney representing Walters in the
U.S. Bankruptcy Court filing, said Thursday that creditors include
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., Mellon Bank, Silverado and
Walters' ex-wife, Mary Lou.
   Jones said creditors probably will only get a fraction of what
they are owed.
   ``There are a few assets available, possibly a few hundred
thousand dollars,'' said Jones. ``Bill is a good guy who has gotten
a lot of bad publicity. He was at the end of his rope.''
   During early and mid-1980s, Walters was one of Denver's highest
profile developers. He listed his net worth at $200 million during
those years.
   But the oil bust took its toll on his real estate and banking
holdings. He sold Cherry Creek National Bank in 1988 and it failed
last month. His other two banks failed in 1987.
   Earlier this year, Walters told a congressional panel
investigating Silverado's $1 billion failure that he was broke, but
vowed not to seek bankruptcy protection and to pay back what he
owed the thrift.
   But a few weeks later, he was found to be living in a $1.9
million estate in Newport Beach, Calif., listed in the name of his
wife Jacqueline.
   Walters became a prominent figure in the nation's thrift crisis
because of his business relationship with President Bush's son,
Neil, a Silverado director. Bush voted to approve $106 million in
loans to Walters, who defaulted on the loans.
   The bankruptcy filing says he owes Manufacturers Hanover $111
million and Mellon Bank $23 million. Jones said Walters owes
Silverado $18.5 million and Mary Lou Walters about $5.35 million.
   Jones said Walters has no personal obligation to pay many of the
loans from Silverado and thus owes only a fraction of the $106
million on which he defaulted.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, getting
more mileage out of hopes for a more generous credit policy at the
Federal Reserve.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.01 points to
2,467.82 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 835 up, 463 down and
498 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 1.1 percent in October, slightly
exceeding advance estimates in the financial world.
   But the so-called ``core'' rate of inflation - excluding food
and energy prices - was unchanged from September.
   That gave investors some hope that the Federal Reserve would see
more leeway to relax its credit policy in the near future,
promoting lower interest rates.
   On Thursday the Treasury completed a three-day auction of a
record $34.25 billion in bonds and notes to a warm reception.
Analysts said that gave a little extra credence to talk of lower
rates.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1&lsqb; at
52~; International Business Machines, up 1&lsqb; at 108|; Pepsico, up &rsqb;
at 24\, and Ford Motor, up } at 27\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.47 to 169.61. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .30 at 289.37.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.27 million shares at

   The Belgian government is seeking
private investors for the national airline Sabena, Communications
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said Friday.
   Dehaene also announced that Pierre Godfroid, a vice president of
Campbell Soup Co. in the United States, has been named chairman of
Sabena. Godfroid succeeds Carlos Van Rafelghem, who has been
hospitalized since July.
   Dehaene told reporters the government was setting a January 1991
deadline to privatize Sabena. The government owns 53 percent while
the rest is owned by regional governments or state-controlled
investment funds.
   Dehaene said the company would be ``as close to private'' as
possible while remaining publicly controlled, with the government
maintaining a minority stake.
   He said some form of Sabena shares could trade eventually on the
Brussels stock exchange and expected most of the fresh capital
coming from Belgian groups.
   He did not say how much capital Sabena needs. Belgian newspaper
reports have said the company may need $196 million to maintain its
operations.
   Sabena posted an operating loss of 1.26 billion francs, or $41.2
million, in 1989. Airline officials predicted in June the company
would lost another 1.5 billion francs, or $49 million, in 1990.

<HEAD>Two Charged With Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men were charged with fraud in an
alleged insider trading scheme in which prosecutors claim they
traded stocks based on information obtained from advance copies of
Business Week magazine.
   Benjamin B. Libera, 35, and Francis R. Sablone, 41, each were
charged with one count of conspiracy, prosecutors said. Libera also
was charged with 45 counts of mail fraud and 55 counts of
securities fraud; Sablone was charged with 26 counts of mail fraud
and 58 counts of securities fraud.
   Sablone's attorney, James Wade, said Friday his client denies
any role in the alleged scheme. ``He ... asserts vigorously his
innocence and indeed, we raise the question as to whether or not a
crime took place at all,'' Wade said.
   The indictment, returned Thursday by a federal grand jury in New
Haven, alleges that between October 1986 and July 1988, Libera and
Sablone engaged in a scheme to trade securities based on
information from the ``Inside Wall Street'' column in copies of
Business Week magazine not yet released to the general public.
   The two men allegedly paid $20 to $30 to employees of the
magazine's printing company, R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, of Old
Saybrook, in exchange for advance copies of the magazine, said U.S.
Attorney Stanley A. Twardy Jr.
   The indictment alleges the magazines were delivered to Libera
and Sablone every Thursday morning; the magazine is released to the
general public later in the day.
   Companies receiving favorable mention in the column often see
their stock price rise temporarily. By obtaining the column early,
the two allegedly were able to get a jump on the market by trading
the stocks of companies in the column. The indictment alleges that
Sablone grossed $75,079 and that Libera grossed $113,806 as a
result of the early trades.
   Each of the charges carries a maximum penalty of 5 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Attempts to reach Libera and Sablone were unsuccessful.

   The vast majority of top economists in a
monthly survey believe a recession will begin before year's end,
but most predict it will be brief and relatively mild, a prominent
economic newsletter reported Friday.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators said 80 percent of the 55
economists in its survey feel a downturn will start before the end
of 1990. Another 5 percent said the slump would start in 1991.
   ``It now seems very likely that America's longest peacetime
expansion is about to come to an end,'' wrote Blue Chip editor
Robert J. Eggert of Eggert Economic Enterprises Inc. in Sedona,
Ariz.
   Even President Bush, while avoiding the use of the word
recession, acknowledged at a Thursday news conference that ``we're
in for some tough times right now.''
   And Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser, said Thursday
the economy could slip into ``negative territory'' this year.
   ``The economy at best is in a lull, but we do expect that lull
to be relatively brief and relatively minor,'' Boskin told the
American Council for Capital Formation here.
   The Blue Chip survey found three-fourths of the respondents
expect any downturn to last no more than two or three quarters.
   ``An even larger majority - 82 percent - anticipate that the
recession will be relatively mild,'' the newsletter said.
   Because of the predicted slump, the newsletter's masthead was
printed in red ink for the first time since the last recession - a
warning that economic growth may drop below zero. A recession
generally is defined as two consecutive quarterly economic
declines.
   Since the economy emerged from the July 1981-November 1982
downturn, the Blue Chip banner has been either green or yellow.
   Green meant the economy was expanding above long-range growth
potential of 3 percent, while yellow warned that economic growth
was lagging between zero and 2.9 percent.
   The survey's consensus forecast anticipated a 0.8 percent annual
rate of decline during the current quarter, followed by a 0.6
percent drop from January through March 1991.
   It projected growth picking up 0.8 percent, 2.1 percent and 2.5
percent in the following quarters.
   The survey participants represent many of the nation's top
banks, brokerage companies, corporations, economic forecasting
organizations and universities.
   However, there are dissenting economists.
   Lawrence Kudlow, a top Reagan administration economist now with
Bear Stearns &amp; Co., told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on Thursday
he foresees ``no off-the-cliff recession.''
   But he said he wouldn't be surprised to see a negative fourth
quarter before the economy picked up to a 2 percent growth rate for
1991.
   Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. also says the economy
could fall during the current quarter, but added ``we are not
projecting two consecutive quarters of declining GNP.''
   The gross national product, the nation's broadest measure of
economic activity, is the nation's total output of goods and
services.
   The consensus forecast in the Blue Chip survey calls for 1
percent growth this year in the GNP. It grew 1.7 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter, followed by 0.4 percent and 1.8
percent rates in the next two.
   But expectations for growth in 1991 continued to slide,
``dropping three-tenths of a percentage point to a paltry 0.5
percent.''
   And, the newsletter reported, ``the outlook for inflation also
continued on the gloomy side with the consensus estimate for the
annualized rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index for the
current quarter jumping to 7.1 percent.''
   That would push the inflation rate for the year to 5.5 percent.
However, the inflation rate would slow to a 5.2 percent increase
during 1991.

   Fear of war in the Persian Gulf jolted oil
prices for the third straight month in October, but slowing
economic growth held wholesale price inflation for non-food and
non-energy items to zero.
   The Labor Department said Friday that its Producer Price Index
for finished goods, one step short of retail, jumped a seasonally
adjusted 1.1 percent last month.
   That followed increases of 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August, bringing the annual inflation rate for the year
so far to levels not seen in nine years.
   Wholesale price inflation, on an annual basis, was 7 percent for
the first 10 months of 1990, the highest since a 7.1 percent rise
in 1981.
   Even though the October number was higher than the predicted 0.7
percent rise, stock and bond markets rallied immediately after the
report because prices outside the volatile food and energy sectors
were unchanged. This so-called ``core'' inflation rate is
considered a better indicator of long-term inflationary trends.
   Traders took the absence of core inflation as a sign the Federal
Reserve Board likely would stimulate the economy with lower
interest rates after its policymakers meet Tuesday.
   Economists are optimistic that despite the sharp rises of the
last three months, inflation will remain under control unless war
in the Middle East destroys Saudi Arabia's oil-production
facilities. The economy is simply too weak for most goods producers
to pass on higher energy costs, they say.

   In fact, the latest edition of a prominent survey of private
economists said the nation likely will topple into a recession
before the end of the year.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators of Sedona, Ariz., reported Friday
that 44 of the 55 economists in its survey believe a downturn will
start before the end of 1990. Another three said the slump would
start in 1991.
   To symbolize the shift, the survey newsletter changed its
nameplate from yellow to red for the first time since the 1981-82
recession.

   ``The climate is not going to be favorable for an increase in
inflation,'' said economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust
Co. in Chicago. ``We're in a bad inflation patch now, but we'll get
through it.''
   In October, energy costs led prices higher, rising 8 percent
compared with 13.8 percent in September and 9.5 percent the month
before that.
   Fuel oil prices rose 15 percent and were 67.5 percent higher
than a year earlier. Natural gas costs, however, edged down 0.3
percent.
   Gasoline prices increased 8 percent and were 50.2 percent higher
than a year earlier.
   Food prices, meanwhile, rose 0.9 percent, the biggest increase
since unseasonably cold weather froze southern fruit and vegetable
crops in January.
   Egg costs were up 9.5 percent; pork, 8.2 percent, and beef and
turkeys, 5.1 percent. Prices also rose for vegetables and pasta.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak said consumers' demand for red meat
has fallen about as much as is likely and farmers are building
their herds in anticipation of growing demand. That means they are
sending fewer animals to slaughter, pushing prices higher.
   The increases were partly offset by declines in the prices of
fresh fruit, rice, chickens, fish, dairy products, coffee and
cooking oils.
   In other categories, the price of passenger cars fell 2.7
percent after jumping 3.4 percent a month earlier. Economists
attributed the fluctuations to the fact that price increases and
discounts this year have been out of sync with auto dealers' usual
seasonal pattern.
   Other declines were recorded for men's and boys' clothing, floor
coverings and household flatware. Prices rose 3.4 percent for
newspapers and were also up for books, women's clothing, cosmetics,
tobacco and jewelry.
   The various changes left the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 122.3 in October. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $122.30
last month, up from $114.70 a year earlier.
   Prices at earlier stages of the production process were also up
sharply, driven by energy. Prices rose 1.5 percent for
intermediate-level goods and 8.7 percent for crude-level goods.
Excluding energy and food, however, prices rose only 0.4 percent at
the intermediate level and fell 1.7 percent at the crude level.
   Crude petroleum prices jumped 29.2 percent in October and were
double the level of a year ago.
   An example of the three processing stages would be bread for
finished, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.

   Electronic Data Systems, the computer services
division of General Motors Co., will develop computer systems and
applications for the Swedish automaker Saab in a 10-year deal worth
an estimated $300 million, the companies said Friday.
   The contract is the first of its type for a Swedish company. It
is also the first time EDS has acknowledged work for another
automaker.
   EDS will manage Saab's current information systems and develop
data processing strategies. About 250 Saab data processing
employees will be transferred to EDS.
   ``We see this as a long-term strategic partnership which will
help us handle our (information technology) needs more efficiently
and cost-effectively,'' David Herman, president of Saab Automobile,
said in a news release from Stockholm.
   The Saab agreement is a ``natural progression'' for EDS'
European business, said Juergen Berg, who directs the company's
European operations.
   Berg said the pact will form a base for EDS in the Swedish
information technology market, which has been predicted to grow 18
percent annually over the next four years.

   The stock market chalked up a broad gain today,
getting further mileage out of hopes for a more generous credit
policy at the Federal Reserve.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.19 points to
2,475.00 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 2 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 970 up, 484 down and
473 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 1.1 percent in October, slightly
exceeding advance estimates in the financial world.
   But the so-called ``core'' rate of inflation - excluding food
and energy prices - was unchanged from September.
   That gave investors some hope that the Federal Reserve would
find more leeway to relax its credit policy in the near future,
promoting lower interest rates.
   On Thursday the Treasury completed a three-day auction of a
record $34.25 billion in bonds and notes to a warm reception.
Analysts said that gave a little extra credence to talk of lower
rates.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1{ at
53\; International Business Machines, up 2 at 109{; Philip Morris,
up ~ at 48~, and Eastman Kodak, up } at 40|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<TEXT>
   Depressed business across Wall Street has
triggered a round of severe cuts that for the first time is digging
sharply into the high-profile fields of the booming 1980s and
leaving many senior executives unemployed.
   The reversal of fortune has caused punishing losses and pushed a
few firms into bankruptcy, eliminated tens of thousands of jobs,
dried up key money-making areas and deflated the image of Wall
Street pros as ``Masters of the Universe.''
   In the last two weeks alone:
   -Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. fired 50 investment bankers, reducing the
department to 575 from about 700 at the beginning of 1990. The
nation's biggest securities firm has eliminated 2,300 jobs this
year. No. 2 Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc. has cut 3,000.
   -First Boston Corp. laid off 45 workers from its 475-person
stock division, bringing a week's firings to about 100. Hundreds
more layoffs are expected there by year-end.
   -Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. let go 10 investment bankers from a staff
of around 200. Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. fired 120 of 180
investment bankers and revered Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. pared 50
bankers, 6 percent of its force. Other firms are firing
professionals in small increments.
   Wall Street executives say rumors of further layoffs have
triggered paranoia that is hurting firms' ability to do what
limited business exists. Salaries and bonuses are forecast to drop
sharply. Unlike earlier cuts, senior managers and partners are
being let go.
   ``Everyone is looking behind them to see if the ax is coming at
his head,'' said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president with GZ
Stephens Inc., a recruiting firm.
   ``You have an immense morale problem right now,'' she said.
``When people are this insecure, their ability to go out and
generate business and ... concentrate on the business at hand drops
dramatically.''
   Nationwide, more than 45,000 securities industry jobs have been
cut since the October 1987 stock market crash. The latest
reductions focus on highly paid investment bankers who handled the
large mergers and takeovers of the 1980s but have seen their
business evaporate.
   The value of U.S. mergers and acquisitions in the first 10
months of 1990 was down 50 percent compared with the same period
last year, according to IDD Information Services, a research and
publishing concern.
   IDD said 3,575 deals valued at $185.9 billion were completed
from January through October, vs. 4,273 valued at $373.4 billion in
the same 1989 period. The drop was most severe in deals worth more
than $50 million, where investment firms make the most lucrative
fees.
   Crucial fees from underwriting stocks and bonds plummeted to
$1.5 billion in the first nine months of 1990, down 30 percent from
a year earlier and the lowest level since 1984, according to
Securities Data Co.
   The lack of mergers and underwriting by U.S. companies is blamed
on a slow economy, declining stock market volume and insecurity
about the future, in large part because of the Middle East crisis.
   Analysts' projections on further securities industry layoffs
range from at least 10,000 to as many as 40,000.
   ``If '91 turns out to be the way the last couple months have
been then you'll probably see much more,'' said Lawrence
Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache. ``I would say that '91 would have
to be the washout year.''
   Several Wall Street executives said the degree of layoffs was
exaggerated because financial firms typically pare staffing in the
fourth quarter to plan for next year. Cynics say it's cheaper to
pay severance than an annual bonus.
   ``People say the environment is rough and tough and I agree,''
Bear Stearns Chairman Alan C. Greenberg said. ``That doesn't mean
it won't change tomorrow.''
   All agree that Wall Street firms are adjusting to reality
following a period of startling growth. Employment has been reduced
to 1985 levels, but that's still more than 50 percent higher than
in 1980.
   As profits and revenue at top firms sink, managers are assessing
the productivity of certain business lines - witness
Prudential-Bache's investment banking purge - and cutting back
spending as much as possible.
   Some executives said the task is made more difficult by the
uncertain future. If firms scale back too much, will they be
prepared for a possible rebound?
   ``There's a slowdown, but I've seen four or five cycles
before,'' said William E. Mayer, who this week announced his
resignation as First Boston's head of merchant banking. ``This is
just nastier and a little longer.''
   ``Beyond that, there's going to be an industry and people are
going to do well in it,'' he said. ``But that's going to take a
couple years.''

<HEAD>USX, Union Negotiate New Contract As Deadline Approaches</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE DRESSLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. and United Steelworkers union
negotiators gave no hint Friday on the fate of a new contract for
18,000 employees as Saturday's deadline for reaching an agreement
approached.
   Neither the company nor the union would discuss the progress of
the talks, which began Oct. 15.
   ``I don't know whether we'll have something over the weekend or
not,'' said USX spokesman Ernie Glenn.
   Failure to strike a deal by Saturday would not necessarily be a
major setback. The old contract does not expire until February.
   But if the talks drag on, the risk of losing customers who fear
a strike will grow, analysts said.
   ``They've got to settle very, very soon to avoid losing a lot of
business,'' said Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS Securities
in New York. ``They can't wait until early December. The customers
will put their business elsewhere.''
   The union wants USX to fall in line with other steel makers who
restored pay cuts taken by workers during the industry's decline in
the early 1980s.
   The wage concessions made by USX workers average about $1.30 an
hour, said Andrew ``Lefty'' Palm, the union's chief negotiator.
   Greg Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer in Pittsburgh,
said USX can afford to restore concessions today, but could face a
struggle to pay higher wages if the economy doesn't improve soon.
   ``This business is still highly cyclical,'' he said. ``They have
tremendous capital costs.''
   Industry steel orders in the past month were about 20 percent
lower than in the same period of 1989, reflecting high inventories,
a slowdown in construction and some automobile plant closures,
Bradford said.
   In the third quarter, USX's earnings dropped 6.8 percent from a
year earlier, with gains in the energy segment but a 26 percent
income drop from the steel division.
   Most major steel makers' earnings have dropped in the past year,
and competitors would eagerly snatch customers from any supplier
whose ability to produce is interrupted by a strike.
   But analysts said they expect no strike at USX this time. The
last, four-year agreement was reached after a six-month lockout and
shutdown of the company in 1986.
   ``Neither side wants a strike,'' Bradford said. ``Both sides
lost in the strike last time.''
   Ben Fischer, director of the Center for Labor Studies at
Carnegie Mellon University, said the early target date signalled
both sides were feeling confident.
   ``They didn't plan to fail and they don't plan to fail,'' said
Fischer, who believes meeting Saturday's deadline is not critical.
   ``If they are still meeting, if they are continuing to work,
then the particular hours and days are not that critical,'' he
said. ``The most critical thing is to not give people reason to
think there will be a strike.''
   USX's board of directors voted Oct. 30 to make the steel and
energy giant's steel operations a wholly owned subsidiary in a move
that could pave the way for a restructuring.
   Fisher said there was no reason to believe the move would
jeopardize an agreement.
   ``It's not like USX has never had spinoffs and joint ventures
and to the best of my knowledge none of them have resulted in
charges the workers' actual vested interests have been subverted,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines on Friday named John H.
Dasburg president and chief executive officer to succeed Frederick
B. Rentschler, who has resigned.
   Rentschler, who will remain a director on the NWA Inc. board,
had been president of the nation's fourth largest carrier since
June. He said his reasons for leaving are personal.
   ``There are personal and family situations that require my time
and energy,'' he said. ``I leave Northwest with genuine regret. The
people have been terrific and the industry is exciting and
gratifying. There is no doubt in my mind that John will be a leader
in the travel industry.''
   Said Northwest Chairman Al Checchi: ``While I am sorry Fred is
leaving our team, I understand the need to focus on overriding
family and personal priorities. I respect his decision.''
   Dasburg, 47, previously Northwest's executive vice
president-finance and administration, will begin his new duties
immediately. He joined Northwest in November 1989 after nine years
at the Marriott Corp. He held several positions with Marriott,
including president of its Lodging Group, a $3.5 billion business
with more than 100,000 employees.
   Before that, he was Marriott's chief financial officer and also
was responsible for real estate development and architecture and
construction programs.
   ``John Dasburg has impeccable business experience, he knows the
importance of customer service in the travel industry, and he
shares the vision of making Northwest the airline of preference for
our customers and the best place to work for our employees,''
Checchi said.

<HEAD>Government To Seek Billions for S&amp;L Claims; Drexel Says It's Show</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal savings and loan regulators may seek up
to $10 billion from Drexel Burhnam Lambert Inc. for junk bond
investment losses at more than 20 thrifts, people involved in the
case said Friday.
   A lawyer for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the
Resolution Trust Corp. said ``very substantial claims'' would be
filed next week against the collapsed Wall Street firm now in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   The agencies are expected to seek $5 billion to $10 billion for
losses incurred by failed thrifts on investments in high-yield debt
securities handled by Drexel, an individual familiar with their
plans said.
   The total is expected to reflect tripled damages based an
allegations of antitrust law violations, the individual said. The
FDIC insures deposits for the nation's savings and loans.
Resolution Trust oversees the federal thrift bailout.
   The agencies plan to allege fraud and other wrongdoing in
dealings between Drexel's junk bond department headed by convicted
financier Michael Milken and more than 20 savings and loans, FDIC
attorney Thomas Barr said.
   Barr declined to comment on the size of the potential claims, or
whether they would include antitrust or racketeering charges.
   Several big savings and loans invested billions of dollars in
risky high-yield securities sold by Drexel. The junk bond market
collapsed about a year ago, devastating the value of these
securities.
   In papers filed in bankruptcy court, Barr said Resolution Trust
on Oct.31 had a junk bond portfolio valued at $3 billion to $4
billion, with most of the securities underwritten or managed by
Drexel. Resolution Trust has taken over more than 100 savings and
loans.
   The filings said Resolution Trust and some of the thrifts have
been forced to sell large amounts of Drexel-related junk bonds ``at
substantial losses.''
   Through their lawyers, Drexel and Milken have denied any role in
the collapse of the nation's savings and loans. At a pre-sentencing
hearing for Milken, former Drexel employees stated that Drexel
engaged in illegal activity with at least one major thrift.
   Civil lawsuits filed against Drexel, Milken and others have
alleged widespread junk bond fraud at thrifts including Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association and Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association.
Separate trials involving those thrifts are scheduled.
   Drexel is reorganizing under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy
law. It faces more than 100 civil lawsuits alleging stock
manipulation, racketeering, insider trading and numerous other
crimes by Drexel and related entities.
   Lawyers are negotiating over the total amount to be allotted in
Drexel's reorganization to settle the lawsuits by investors,
ex-clients and others. A figure must be approved by U.S. District
Judge Milton Pollack, who is handling the litigation.
   The thrift claims are part of those talks. In addition, the
Internal Revenue Service also is expected to file a large claim
against Drexel.
   Drexel attorney Alan Miller said ``there won't be anything
like'' $5 billion to $10 billion in an agreement settling the civil
litigation.
   He criticized the possible FDIC filing as ``an attempt by one
creditor to dilute the claims all the other creditors'' and to
blame Drexel for the thrift collapse.
   Drexel has about $3 billion in assets and $2.85 billion in
existing undisputed claims. The assets do not reflect the value of
the firm's junk bond portfolio and stock investments in
Drexel-managed takeover deals.
   In court papers, the FDIC said its claims would be filed by a
Thursday deadline but asked for 90 more days to complete its
investigation. The FDIC charged that Drexel was not cooperating
with its efforts.
   The papers said that more than 100 accountants and 50 lawyers
were investigating the junk bond holdings of failed thrifts
nationwide and had collected more than five million pages of
documents.
   They said junk bond records of thrifts taken over by Resolution
Trust ``are in a state of some disarray.'' They also charged that
thrift executives removed boxes of records before the federal
takeovers and that important employees refused to cooperate with
the investigation.
   Claude Montgomery, a lawyer for former Drexel stockholders,
whose claims would be last to be met, said a huge demand by the
thrift agencies could lead to more litigation ``because some
numbers are just too big to negotiate.''
   ``It does strike many of us that somewhat strange that the RTC
should be filing claims against an institution on the theory that
it brought the S&amp;Ls down,'' he said, adding that ``to blame Drexel
instad of Congress and the regulators and 50 years of history is a
little bit aggressive.''

   The stock market staged a spirited rally today,
getting further mileage out of hopes for a more generous credit
policy at the Federal Reserve.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the producer
price index of finished goods rose 1.1 percent in October, slightly
exceeding advance estimates in the financial world.
   But the so-called ``core'' rate of inflation - excluding food
and energy prices - was unchanged from September.
   That bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve would find more
leeway to relax its credit policy in the near future, promoting
lower interest rates.
   On Thursday the Treasury completed a three-day auction of a
record $34.25 billion in bonds and notes to a warm reception.
Analysts said that gave extra credence to talk of lower rates.

<HEAD>Staff Cuts, Other Measures Planned at Australian Carrier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Qantas Airways will reduce its
workforce by 500 by the end of February to help it survive an
industrywide downturn prompted by higher jet fuel costs, chief
executive John Ward said Friday.
   Ward also said five Boeing 747s would be sold earlier than
planned and flying hours would be cut back, as part of a
cost-cutting plan.
   ``These steps are essential if we are to survive,'' he said,
adding that more job cuts were ``inevitable, although the number
depended on the state of the world economies and the impact on
travel demand.''
   Qantas has said its annual fuel bill would rise by 100 million
to 200 million Australian dollars ($78 million to $156 million
U.S.) because of the Middle East crisis and its effect on jet fuel
prices.
   The airline, 49 percent of which the government plans to sell,
has already axed 60 management jobs and 21 jobs in Europe.
   It has also frozen staff recruiting and withdrawn services from
Amsterdam, Athens, Bombay and Bahrain.
   ``We're in a critical period,'' Ward said. ``Small downturns in
traffic and small increases in costs play havoc with
profitability.''
   The International Air Transport Association has predicted
collective losses of $3.5 billion U.S. for the world's airlines
this year.
   Later this month, Qantas is expected to report a small profit
for the past financial year after some aircraft disposals prevented
a loss.
   Ward said Qantas had to restructure its operations to ensure it
can continue to compete on international routes and take full
advantage of tourism opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEAD>Soybean Stocks May Grow But Some Experts Still Bullish On Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The government now says the U.S. soybean stockpile is growing
instead of shrinking but market analysts aren't quite ready to
reverse their predictions for higher soybean prices in the coming
year.
   Some experts say it is too early to know whether this year's
larger-than-expected U.S. soybean harvest means prices will
continue to weaken after the shock of the government latest crop
report wears off.
   But others contend the six-month outlook is as bullish as ever,
based mainly on expectations for a small South American soybean
crop.
   They agree that two keys to the market's behavior between now
and next summer will be the level of export demand for U.S.
soybeans that develops early next year after current South American
supplies are depleted, and the growing conditions that prevail in
Brazil and Argentina this winter, which is their summer.
   ``If we get any kind of weather problem down there, it will
restimulate the bullish situation,'' said Doug Jackson, a grain
analyst with Farmers Commodities Corp. in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Analysts were forced to reassess their price forecasts after the
Agriculture Department on Thursday raised its estimate for the 1990
U.S. soybean crop by an unprecedented 4.4 percent to 1.9 billion
bushels from its October projection of 1.82 billion.
   It was the biggest October-to-November increase ever in the
USDA's harvest projections. Most experts had expected a number near
1.84 billion bushels.
   The government also raised its estimate of how large the U.S.
soybean stockpile will be next Aug. 31, the end of the current
marketing year, to 255 million bushels from 175 million compared
with 239 million bushels last August.
   Soybean futures prices plunged Friday, the day after the report.
Soybeans for delivery in November fell 16{ cents to $5.66} a
bushel.
   Prior to the report, many analysts were expecting soybean prices
to rise sharply early next year due to relatively tight U.S.
supplies and prospects for low production in South America, where
economically distressed farmers are expected to plant fewer acres
than last year.
   Thursday's crop report indicates U.S. supplies will not be as
tight as expected.
   ``The situation has gone from one that's slightly constructive
fundamentally to one that's neutral to bearish,'' said Anne Frick,
senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New
York
   But other analysts said the bigger U.S. harvest estimate will
encourage South American producers to plant even fewer soybean
acres, which would offset the negative impact on prices. The South
American planting season is under way.
   ``This will lock in the fact that South America will lower
production,'' said William Biedermann, research director with
Allendale Inc., a commodities brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill.
   The wild card is export demand, which has been extremely weak
lately but is bound to pick up by early next year as foreign
consumers seek U.S. supplies.
   Biedermann said foreign demand will be stimulated by a drop in
soybean prices in the next few weeks as the market digests the crop
report.
   ``The lower we go bewteen now and December, the more bullish the
picture gets long-term,'' he said.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the
grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., agreed.
   ``I think the lower prices will enhance demand,'' he said. ``I
think by next summer we'll be back up again.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices fell sharply near the close of
trading Friday on a wild rumor of an Iraqi coup.
   Oil had been moving lower anyway, as traders decided they had
bid prices too high Thursday on erroneous speculation that
President Bush was about to announce steps leading to an immediate
conflict in the Persian Gulf.
   ``People aren't expecting any gunfire until next year now,''
said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus
Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   The coup rumor floated in with about a half hour left to trade,
pushing the already depressed price down another 60 cents.
   ``That probably just fueled things a little bit,'' said trader
Ed Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Light sweet crude, the benchmark blend of petroleum, settled at
$33.89 per barrel, down $1.64, for December delivery contracts on
the New York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for delivery in later
months all closed more than $1 lower.
   For the week, crude fell 11 cents a barrel for next-month
delivery.
   Oil opened lower Friday, as traders determined they had
overestimated the impact of a news conference Bush had given the
evening before.
   During Thursday's session, oil shot up as traders speculated
Bush's statement, which came after the market closed, would contain
either an ultimatum to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein or a vow to
airlift supplies to the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   Bush instead said he was vastly increasing the U.S. military
presence in the Gulf, which traders already had been anticipating.
   ``I think people were expecting some type of ultimatum and what
they received was the same old thing,'' Blakeslee said.
   Traders in the New York Mercantile Exchange recently have been
scared of going through the weekend with speculative positions, so
some of Friday's selloff came as they sold oil contracts.
   As crude oil fell, it dragged down the price of refined products
traded on the exchange, a key market for petroleum.
   Wholesale home heating oil dropped 4.06 cents to 90.24 cents a
gallon on December delivery contracts, while wholesale unleaded
gasoline fell 2.28 cents to 88.23 cents a gallon for December
delivery. Later contract months were all lower for both products.
   For the week, heating oil rose 2.82 cents for next-month
delivery, while unleaded gasoline fell .98 cent.
   Natural gas prices were lower or unchanged Friday, with December
delivery contracts falling .6 cent to $2.429 per 1,000 cubic feet.
For the week, next-month contracts for natural gas were up 7.1
cents.

<HEAD>Soybeans Hit 8{-Month Low on Bigger Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell to 8{-month lows Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, dragging grain futures down as well, after
the government issued a surprisingly large estimate of the newly
harvested crop.
   On other commodity markets, oil and precious metal futures fell;
cattle futures rose; and pork futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 5 cents to 17\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in November at $5.66} a bushel, the lowest
settlement of a near-month soybean contract since Feb. 28, when the
March contract finished at $5.66{.
   Wheat futures ended 2{ cents to 3{ cents lower with December at
$2.65} a bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with December at
$2.31 a bushel; oats were 3{ cents to 4 cents lower with December
at $1.17{ a bushel.
   Soybeans were pounded by heavy selling from all sectors after
the Agriculture Department on Thursday released a monthly crop
report raising its soybean production estimate 4.4 percent to 1.9
billion bushels from the October estimate of 1.82 billion. The
market had expected a number near 1.84 billion.
   The report heaped more bearish news on a market that has been
burdened recently by slack export demand.
   ``With export business not being robust, what we need here is
lower prices to hopefully induce better demand,'' said Gerald
Zusel, grain analyst with E.D. &amp; F. Man International Futures Inc.
   The government reduced its corn production estimate to 7.9
billion bushels from 8 billion, which was not enough to offset the
bearish implications of the soybean number.
   Oil futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange
amid profit-taking that reflected reduced fears of imminent war in
the Middle East.
   President Bush's announcement Thursday that more U.S. troops
will be sent to Saudi Arabia might indicate the U.S.-led
multinational force is preparing to attack Iraq troops eventually,
but it quashed expectations for an offensive move in the next few
days.
   The oil market rallied earlier in the week on perceptions that
the U.S. was preparing for an attack this week.
   ``Now it looks like the attack might be put off for a while,''
said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser with Jesup
Josephthal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Light sweet crude oil futures finished $1.01 to $1.64 lower with
December at $33.89 a barrel; heating oil was 2.55 cents to 4.06
cents lower with December at 90.24 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.51 cents to 2.38 cents lower with December at 88.23
cents gallon.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to a variety of bearish factors including
lower oil prices, sharply higher stock prices and a government
report on wholesale prices that indicated inflation outside the
food and energy categories virtually vanished last month.
   Platinum futures fell sharply in thin trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Gold futures were $2.60 to $2.90 lower with December at $386.30
a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents lower across the board with
December at $4.237 a troy ounce; platinum was $11.20 to $11.30
lower with January at $410.30 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures advanced, paced by sharp gains in the live cattle
market, as strength in the cash cattle and beef markets pulled
futures higher.
   Recent gains in pork prices have made beef more attractive to
retailers, which resulted in stronger packer demand for cattle,
said Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Hog futures ended mostly lower but pork bellies advanced amid
continuing concerns about tight supplies of frozen stocks.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .95 cent higher with December at
78.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .55 cent higher
with November at 88.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .42 cent lower
to .18 cent higher with December at 52.65 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .65 cent to 1.25 cents higher with February at
69.85 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael H. Spindler, Apple Computer
Inc.'s chief operating officer, has been named president in a move
that changes no one's responsibilities but endorses his leadership
role, the company said Friday.
   Spindler, who helped launch the computermaker on a turnaround
program, will continue to report directly to John Sculley, Apple's
chairman, chief executive officer and former president. Spindler
also was nominated to Apple's board of directors.
   ``These actions represent strong votes of confidence in Michael
Spindler and ringing endorsements of the excellent job he has done
at Apple since becoming chief operating officer in February 1990,''
Sculley said.
   Spindler's new title and Sculley's relinquishing of it are
merely formalities, said Apple spokeswoman Barbara Krause.
   ``It really is just a title change. At many Fortune 100
companies, the COO is also president because it signifies
leadership of the operational units of the company,'' she said.
   Apple, after several years of fast growth, recently suffered a
sales slowdown and its share of the desktop computer market fell.
Critics blamed the problem on the high prices Apple charged for its
Macintosh line - $1,799 to $11,000 - as clones of International
Business Machines Corp. personal computers dominated the low end of
the market.
   But Apple has overhauled its strategy, hoping to trade high
profit margins for increased sales. It introduced low-cost
Macintoshes last month that start at just under $1,000.
   Spindler, who successfully headed Apple's European operations,
was made chief operating officer in a top-level reorganization. He
took over sales, marketing, manufacturing and corporate
communications while Sculley focuses on research and development.
   Bernard Goldstein, a partner at Broadview Associates, a Fort
Lee, N.J., investment bank specializing in the information
technology industry, also has been nominated to Apple's board, the
company said. Shareholders will vote on the nominations at the
annual meeting in January.

   The stock market staged a broad rally Friday,
inspired by falling interest rates and hopes for a more generous
credit policy at the Federal Reserve.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 44.80 to
2,488.61, cutting its loss for the week to 2.23 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

Analysts said that gave extra credence to talk of lower rates.
   In credit-market activity Friday, prices of long-term government
bonds rose about $10 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their
yields to the 8.59 percent-8.62 percent range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 2 at
53}; International Business Machines, up 2} at 110\; Philip Morris,
up } at 48}, and Boeing, up ~ at 44~.
   Bank stocks were broadly higher on hopes that falling rates
would help heal the industry's finances and shore up the real

   BankAmerica rose 1\ to 22\; First Chicago 1 to 15; Chase

   In the consumer credit group, Beneficial Corp. gained 1{ to 39

   Elsewhere, Russ Berrie &amp; Co. rose 1&rsqb; to 15|. The company, which
markets gift merchandise, reported higher third-quarter profits,
raised its quarterly dividend from 10 cents a share to 15 cents a
share, and declared an extra dividend of 60 cents a share.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 146.11 million
shares, against 155.57 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 181.41 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

1.80 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

   Toys R Us, which made its name and fortune by
setting up shop in the 'burbs, has finally moved into the big city.
   The world's largest toy retailer reached a new milestone last
week with the opening of its first downtown branch in the United

across from two big competitors, Macy's flagship department store
and Lionel Corp.'s Kiddie City.
   The move represents a big opportunity for Toys R Us, convenience
for Manhattanites who used to travel to suburbia for toys and a
headache for stores that haven't had this kind of competition
before.
   Robert Nakasone, a Toys R Us vice chairman, said the company was
doing so well in the suburbs it felt for years that it didn't need
to move into downtown locations.
   ``We said, `Why go ahead and do it?'' he said Friday, the
store's second day open.
   But eventually Toys R Us realized Manhattan was too lucrative a
market to keep passing up, Nakasone said. The company decided to
open a toy store and a companion Kids R Us clothing store in the
heart of the city.
   The success of Kiddie City's Herald Square store may well have
been an inducement to Toys R Us to give Manhattan a try.
   Until a few years ago, if you wanted to buy toys in Manhattan,
you had few choices. There was FAO Schwarz on Fifth Avenue for the
upper crust and department stores and a handful of small
neighborhood stores for everyone else.
   Kiddie City was a trailblazer when it opened its Herald Square
store several years ago. It was a big success, and Lionel followed
with two other stores in residential areas of Manhattan.
   Toys R Us, which has more than 700 stores in the United States
and overseas, has branches in New York City's other four boroughs.
But before last week, its only other downtown stores were in
Singapore and Germany.
   The site chosen by Toys R Us is the building known as Herald
Center, on Broadway between 33rd and 34th streets. It couldn't be
more high profile - it is smack in the middle of Manhattan's
biggest shopping area, directly across from Macy's.
   The arrival of Toys R Us provides Herald Center with a chance at
revival following a checkered history.
   The building began retail life as a Saks &amp; Co. branch. Known as
Saks 34th, it was a poor cousin to the more famous Saks Fifth
Avenue.
   Saks closed the store about 30 years ago and it later became a
discount retailer, Korvettes. After Korvettes folded in the 1970s,
the building became Herald Center, a vertical mall that had few
stores and few shoppers.
   The building later was tied to former Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda. It was sold at a
court-ordered auction recently and is being renovated with Toys R
Us and Kids R Us as the mall's centerpieces.
   For Toys R Us, moving into Herald Center required a revamping of
the company's standard one-story configuration. Shelves had to be
fit around pillars and columns and elevators and escalators had to
be installed. The total facelift cost more than $1 million,
Nakasone said.
   The Herald Square store also is more expensive to run.
   With less stockroom space than other Toys R Us stores, it will
have be resupplied more often. That means more trips to the
company's New Jersey warehouse, and higher labor and fuel costs.
   Moving into Manhattan also meant Toys R Us trucks had to be
adapted to fit into the Lincoln Tunnel, a key thoroughfare that
connects New York and New Jersey.
   But to children, it's like any other Toys R Us outlet. It's
stocked from floor to ceiling with dolls, Nintendo units and
cartridges, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and bicycles.
   To competitors, Toys R Us poses a big threat.
   Macy has long touted itself as the place to go for Christmas
toys, but the department store may find itself hard-pressed to
compete with the price and selection that shoppers will find just
across the street.
   Kiddie City, while carrying many toys, also does not have as
wide a selection as Toys R Us. While Toys R Us had aisles of
Nintendo equipment and cartridges last week, Kiddie City's video
games were tucked into a corner of the store.
   FAO Schwarz could find it has lost some sales to its downtown
rival because Toys R Us prices are lower.
   For instance, a popular baby doll called Oopsie Daisy - so named
because she falls down and cries - costs $66 at FAO Schwarz, and
$40 at Toys R Us. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles figures that go for
$8 in FAO Schwarz were selling for $5 at Toys R Us.
   But this doesn't mean a store like FAO Schwarz should close up
shop. The store appears to be downscaling somewhat - it no longer
features a $15,000 junior Ferrari in its catalog - but still has
$100-plus plush animals, $300-plus dolls and a Fifth Avenue cachet
that no other toy store has.
   Nakasone appeared unconcerned about competition. He noted Toys R
Us competes with Kiddie City in other markets.
   He also did not appear worried about the effect that the
weakened economy and the Persian Gulf crisis have had on the retail
business. While declining to project what Toys R Us sales will be
this year, Nakasone predicted parents would still spend generously
on toys.
   ``We expect to have a good Christmas,'' he said.

<HEAD>DollarDown in Sluggish Trading, Gold Falls</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined broadly in slow trading
Friday amid concerns over the U.S. economy and enthusiasm over
possible weekend tensions in the Middle East.
   Gold prices fell.
   With New York currency markets closed on Veterans Day, traders
stocked up on the U.S. currency in advance of a possible Persian
Gulf escalation during the three-day weekend.
   The dollar is generally viewed as a relatively safe investment
in times of strife. In addition, possible oil shortages resulting
from a Persian Gulf strife could hurt Japan's oil-dependent economy
and help diminish the yen's value against the dollar, traders said.
   But before the day's end, currency trading in New York slowed to
a virtual crawl, as investors eyeing the Middle East already had
covered their short-dollar positions.
   Analysts said a bigger influence was an earlier Labor Department
report that showed the nation's ``core'' inflation rate - the
producer price index minus food and energy costs - remained
unchanged from September.
   Investors sold on this sign of moderating inflation, seeing it
as one more reason for the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates
to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates can have a
chilling effect on the value of the dollar.
   ``You're starting to build up a fairly reasonable case for at
least a quarter of a percent cut,'' said Robert Hatcher, a
corporate dealer at Barclays Bank PLC.
   In New York, the dollar dipped to 129.70 yen from 130.35 yen on
Thursday.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.00 yen to a closing 130.50
yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 129.75 yen.
   In New York, one British pound cost $1.9655, more expensive than
Thursday's $1.9625. In London, the pound was quoted at $1.9670,
unchanged from late Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.4870 German marks, down from 1.4930;
1.2499 Swiss francs, down from 1.2535; 4.9940 French francs, down
from 5.0105; 1,119.00 Italian lire, down from 1,122.75, and 1.1683
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1694.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Thursday's
rates included: 1.4875 German marks, down from 1.4885; 1.2495 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2580; 4.9940 French francs, up from 4.9935;
1.6775 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6780; 1,119.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,129.75; 1.1698 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1685.
   Gold fell in slow domestic trading, depressed by a lack of
volatile news about the Middle East standoff, analysts said. It
fell $2.50 a troy ounce to $384.80 on the Commodity Exchange in New
York. Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of
$384.40 a troy ounce, down $2.75.
   In earlier trading in London, gold fell to a late bid of $384.75
a troy ounce, down from $385.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal
rose to $385.80 an ounce from $384.75 late Thursday. Earlier, in
Hong Kong, gold fell $1.73 to close at a $384.58.
   Silver fell on the Commodity Exchange, closing at $4.22 a troy
ounce, down 3.8 cents. In London, silver bullion was unchanged from
Thursday's close at $4.25 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Boosts Ad Rates at Wall Street Journal, Closes Composing Operation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Friday it was boosting
advertising rates for 1991 at The Wall Street Journal, the nation's
largest daily newspaper.
   At the same time, the company confirmed it was closing the
composing operations at its printing plant in Naperville, Ill., and
transferring the plant's responsibilities to a plant in Dallas, for
a net reduction of 30 jobs.
   The moves come as Dow Jones begins an austerity program under
which it has frozen capital spending, is trying to hold salary
spending in 1991 at 1990 levels and is taking other steps to cut
costs.
   Two weeks ago, Dow Jones said it was boosting the cover price of
the Journal to 75 cents from 50 cents effective Dec. 3 and the
yearly subscription price by 7.8 percent to $109.
   The Journal has the largest daily circulation of any U.S.
newspaper, averaging about 1.85 million in the six months ended
Sept. 30.
   The company's earnings have fallen this year as the slump on
Wall Street and the economy as a whole has shown up in sharply
reduced advertising spending by financial companies.
   The new ad rates, which take effect Jan. 2, 1991, include
increases of 6 percent for national edition advertising and bigger
increases for regional and overseas editions.
   The increase will boost the cost of a full-page ad in the
national edition of the Journal to $105,352.
   Rates in the Eastern, Midwest, Western and Southwest editions
will increase 7 percent while regional rates will rise an average
of 9 percent.
   The ad rates will jump 12 percent for the Wall Street Journal
Europe and 10 percent for the Asian Wall Street Journal and The
Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly.
   Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones, said the closing of the
composing operation at the Naperville plant effective in January
reflects technological improvements that enable the company to cut
the number of its composing operations to three from four
nationwide.
   He said the closing would mean a cost savings and an improvement
in operating efficiency but would not adversely affect the quality
of the newspaper.
   He said some of the 40 people employed in the composing
operation in Naperville would be transferred to Dallas, but that
the company expected there would be a net reduction of 30 jobs.
   In addition to the Journal, Dow Jones publishes Barron's
magazine, the Ottaway Group of community newspapers and electronic
business information services. Its Telerate Inc. subsidiary
provides financial information.

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Friday vetoed a bill
intended to block drug companies from reaping windfall profits
through monopolistic marketing of drugs that treat rare diseases.
   The bill applies to ``orphan drugs'' used against diseases that
affect fewer than 200,000 people. It was designed to foster more
competition by eliminating the 7-year exclusive marketing rights
granted under current law to companies that develop such drugs.
   Bush withheld his signature from the bill, and in taking no
action at a time when Congress is not in session killed it through
what is known as a pocket veto.
   ``I have serious concerns about the effect that (the bill) would
have upon the incentive of drug companies to develop orphan
drugs,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chief sponsor of the bill in the
House, said he was ``really shocked'' that Bush did not sign the
bill because the White House had ``never made a fuss'' previously
about the legislation.
   The White House contends that taking away the exclusivity
benefit actually would decrease the willingness of firms to come up
with orphan drugs because of the expense involved in the research
and development.
   The legislation Bush vetoed would have amended the 1983 Orphan
Drug Act that established the 7-year marketing monopoly as an
incentive for companies to develop drugs that don't promise as
large a profit as drugs that are used against more widely prevalent
diseases.
   ``I believe we must not endanger the success of this program,
which is due in large measure to the existence of the `market
exclusivity' provision in the Orphan Drug Act,'' Bush said.
``Weakening the current 7-year period is the basis of the economic
incentive to attract drug firms to invest in orphan drugs.''
   Critics, however, complain the current law has resulted in
excessively high prices for some drugs, including those used to
treat AIDS, and millions of dollars in profits by the drug firms.
   Bush also objected to changing the current law's provision that
allows orphan drug status to diseases that affect more than 200,000
people when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of
developing the drug will be recovered from sales.
   The new legislation would have cut off a drug's orphan drug
status as soon as the number of people who need the drug exceeded
200,000.
   Bush said he was ``extremely concerned ... that individuals with
rare disease may suffer because of changes that this bill would
make in the incentives to develop new drug treatments.''
   The legislation was supported by AIDS activists and other
advocacy groups.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association opposed the
legislation, but said it was not recommending that Bush veto it.
   The PMA contended the current act was working well to stimulate
development of drugs that otherwise would not be of interest to
manufacturers.
   ``Only six of the 45 orphan drug approvals since 1983 are for
populations greater than 50,000. Many of these drugs would not be
available without the incentives offered by the Orphan Drug Act,''
the organization said in a position paper on the legislation.
   There was no immediate comment from the PMA on Bush's veto, said
spokesman Mark Grayson.
   But Waxman alleged, ``Some drug companies have gotten to the ear
of the White House.''
   Waxman said companies don't want to lose the advantage they
enjoy by being the monopoly supplier of drugs used to treat
diseases that once were limited to a small population but have
spread to thousands of people.
   He said drugs to treat AIDS, for example, should no longer be
considered orphan drugs.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who sponsored the bill in the Senate,
was not immediately available for comment.
   The Food and Drug Administration has granted so-called orphan
status to more than 375 drugs, more than 40 of which have reached
the market. Critics have been concerned that some of these drugs
were producing monopolistic windfalls for the drug companies that
marketed them.
   Some of the diseases that orphan drugs have been developed to
treat include Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, narcolepsy
and muscular dystrophy.
   On a separate matter, Bush on Friday signed a bill requiring
food manufacturers to put more nutrition information on the labels
of food packaging.
   The bill also would prohibit manufacturers from making health
claims on their packaging unless scientifically proven according to
the Food and Drug Administration.
   The legislation mandates that most bulk food in bins, raw fish
and fruits and vegetables be displayed with a sign or brochure
providing nutritional information.
   Food labels will have to show calories, calories from fat, fat
content, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrates,
complex carbohydrates, sugars, dietary fiber and protein.

<HEAD>Three U.S. Firms Question Their Elimination From Cellular System
Bidding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communications Ministry said Friday it
selected five finalists for Poland's first cellular telephone
contract and defended the bidding process from questions about its
fairness raised by three U.S. companies.
   Communications Minister Jerzy Slezak did not name the finalists,
but said he had proof the review was fair and would provide full
documentation to the companies seeking the contract, valued at up
to $100 million.
   According to U.S. Ambassador Thomas W. Simons, two U.S.
companies, two European consortia and a Hong Kong company were
among the final five.
   The contract is the first major government project in Poland to
be put to open bid. It attracted international telecommunications
companies and is considered a test of whether the newly capitalist
economy is ready for sophisticated business dealings with the West.
   Cellular telephones are viewed as a quick fix for Poland's
disastrous telephone system, which is impeding business investment.
For the bidders, the contract represents an entry point into the
former East bloc.
   The discontent registered by the three American companies was
underlined by an unusual meeting with journalists held by Simons to
discuss the bidding.
   While cautioning that the U.S. government is making no judgment
about the veracity of the companies' concerns, he said, ``we
recognize there are questions'' about fairness.
   Communications Ministry specialists invited detailed proposals
from eight of 24 companies that made initial offers in February. In
September, three U.S. competitors were eliminated: U S West Inc. of
Englewood, Colorado, Ameritech of Chicago, and Millicom Inc. of New
York.
   From the five finalists - including the U.S. companies Nynex and
Crowley - two will be selected by late December for final
negotiations, Simons said.
   The three disqualified U.S. companies are ``seeking
clarification'' about why they were eliminated based on a review of
the technical section of their proposal, said James Whisenand of
Ameritech.
   ``All the rejected companies are concerned with is that - win or
lose - they have the comfort that the process was pristine and
fair,'' he said.
   Whisenand would not specify how the companies felt the bidding
had been compromised, but said they seek a reappraisal by the
ministry.
   ``All three companies would hope that the process will be
clarified and all eight companies' proposals reviewed,'' he said.
   The companies contend that their size and experience make clear
their ability to meet the technical requirements, Simons said.
   Slezak said he was ``astonished'' by the questions.
   ``I have materials proving ... the fairness of the process,'' he
said. ``Each of the firms concerned will receive full
documentation.''
   The ministry said two of the companies were eliminated because
they violated an anonymity requirement by disclosing their names in
the technical portion of their bids.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel Cutting Price Hike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Steel Corp. said it would halve
an 8 percent price increase scheduled for sheet steel shipments
after Dec. 29, a move that other major steel makers are expected to
followed.
   Bethlehem and the others raised prices in an effort to shore up
eroding profits, said Charles Bradford, an analyst with UBS
Securities in New York.
   Bethlehem told its customers about the price hike in September,
but customers asked for a reprieve, said Bethlehem spokesman Henry
H. Von Spreckelsen said Thursday.
   ``This action is being taken to better reflect the realities of
the marketplace,'' Spreckelsen said.
   But he added, ``At an appropriate time in months ahead,
customers can expect an additional increase to offset rising
costs.''
   A spokesman at USX declined to say whether his company, the
nation's No. 1 steel maker, would follow Bethlehem's lead. However,
Bradford said USX and other steel makers have little choice.
   He said an 8 percent increase was ``kind of a joke in the first
place.''
   ``I don't think too many (companies) really expected to get that
much,'' he said. ``But if you don't ask for more you don't get
anything.''
   Bradford said steel makers need price relief to cover increased
costs and wage hikes that go into effect Jan. 1.
   Sheet steel is used for autos, appliances and construction
materials. Bethlehem makes it at its Burns Harbor, Ind., and
Sparrows Point, Md., plants.
   The company reported earnings of $53.3 million for the first
nine months of 1990, down sharply from $195.7 million in the same
period of 1989.
   Under the new schedule, the price increase on hot-rolled steel
will be lowered to $20 from $35 a ton, on cold-rolled steel to $25
from $47 a ton and on galvanized steel to $30 from $49 a ton.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nordstrom Inc. earnings declined 7 percent
despite an 11 percent increase in sales during the third quarter,
the retailer said Friday.
   The company said profits for the quarter ended Oct. 31 amounted
to $20.4 million, or 25 cents a share, on $634.9 million in sales,
compared with $22 million, or 27 cents a share, on $572.4 million
in sales for the same period last year.
   The sales gains came entirely from stores opened within the past
year. They include stores opened in the third quarter in Santa
Barbara, Calif., and Paramus, N.J., and clearance outlets in San
Leandro, Calif., and Dale City, Va., said John Goesling, senior
vice president.
   Sales at stores open more than a year were down 2 percent in the
quarter, Goesling said.
   ``We are not immune from effects of the softening sales trends
in the entire retail industry,'' he said. ``We are encouraged,
however, that our efforts to control inventories and expenses have
reduced the impact on earnings.''
   Goesling said advertising and the work force at some stores had
been reduced. He refused to give figures or say what other
belt-tightening moves the chain had taken.
   For the first nine months of 1990, net earnings were $69.5
million, or 85 cents a share, on $2 billion in sales, compared with
$84.5 million, or $1.02 a share, on $1.8 billion in sales a year
ago.
   Nordstrom operates 63 stores in Washington, Oregon, California,
Alaska, Idaho, Utah, Virginia and New Jersey.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Jump as Market Anticipates Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices jumped Friday as the
market anticipated the Federal Reserve Board would lower interest
rates when it gathers next week, traders said.
   The price of the government's bellwether 30-year bond climbed
29-32 point, or about $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield,
which falls when the bond's price rises, slid to 8.62 percent from
8.70 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices rose despite a government report showing wholesale
prices soared 1.1 percent in October, the third consecutive monthly
advance, boosted by rising food and energy prices.
   The jump brought producer-price inflation for the first 10
months of the year to a 7 percent annual rate, sharply higher than
1989's 4.9 percent rate and the worst since inflation soared at
double-digit rates in the early 1980s.
   But the bond market took its cue from the so-called core
inflation rate, which doesn't include food and energy prices, said
Bob Sbarra, a senior vice president at the investment firm Carroll
McEntee &amp; McGinley Inc.
   Minus those factors, inflation didn't change from September.
   Investors believe the Fed's Open Market Committee will vote at a
meeting Tuesday to lower interest rates to counteract increasing
signs that the economy is entering a recession, traders said. The
flat core inflation rate also gives the Fed more latitude to lower
rates, they added.
   Lower rates benefit fixed-return securities such as bonds.
   Some traders are looking for a \-point reduction in the federal
funds rate following the Fed's meeting. That is the interest rate
banks charge each other on overnight loans.
   That belief prompted investors to buy government bonds Friday,
bidding up the price, said William Pike, a managing director in the
government bond-trading department of Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co. The government bond market is closed Monday for Veterans Day.
   Pike said the market also was buoyed by a general sense of
optimism, sparked by lower oil and gold prices, higher stock prices
and the successful completion this week of the Treasury's record

<HEAD>Former Mulroney Aide Named To Lead Campeau Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanley Hartt, a former chief of staff to Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney, was named Friday to succeed the ousted
Robert Campeau as head of Campeau Corp.
   Hartt, who was also a Canadian deputy finance minister, was
named president of Campeau Corp. and was expected to be named
chairman and director, the company said in a statement.
   Robert Campeau, 66, was replaced in August as chairman and chief
executive after Campeau Corp. could no longer handle the $10
billion debt burden from its takeovers of Allied Stores Corp. and
Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Allied and Federated are currently undergoing reorganization in
bankruptcy court in the United States.
   After Robert Campeau's ouster, James Raymond and Gary Goodman
shared the chief executive's duties on an interim basis. They will
continue as directors of the corporation, representing two of
Campeau's major creditors and shareholders.
   Raymond is a director of Montreal-based National Bank of Canada
while Goodman is a top executive of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd.
   The bank and Olympia &amp; York became more closely involved with
running Campeau Corp. after it ran into trouble.
   Olympia and York took control of Campeau in Sept. 1989 after
giving the company a $250 million loan. The bank became a major
shareholder after Robert Campeau defaulted on bank loans that were
secured by his Campeau Corp. stock.
   Robert Despres has been Campeau's interim chairman and will
continue as a director of the corporation.
   Campeau lost $298 million in the first half of its current
fiscal year, following a $1.74 billion loss for the year ended Jan.
31, 1990. Third-quarter results for the current year have not been
released.

   The judge said two other counts violated the defendants' right
to due process because they were too vague.
   One of those counts alleges they published advertising for a
bond sale without first filing a copy of the ad with the state
Department of Corporations. The other count alleges they lied to
the department.
   Prosecutors maintained they could amend the indictment to
address the judge's concerns.
   Deputy District Attorney Paul Turley said the judge sustained
defense objections to the charges but did not grant the request for
dismissal and the charges would stand for the time being.

   Turley said that for the first 20 counts, prosecutors would
merely need to be less specific in the charges, which allege that
bonds were sold in ways not approved by the department.
   On the other two counts, prosecutors were more likely to add
additional counts to add more detail, he said.
   Keating and the others are accused of misleading investors and
regulators about the safety of uninsured bonds sold to Lincoln
Savings depositors. About $250 million worth of ``junk bonds''
became worthless when Lincoln and its parent company collapsed.
Many elderly investors lost their life savings.
   Abbe Lowell, one of the defense attorneys, said he did not think
prosecutors would have much luck with the amended charges, which
must be filed with the court by Nov. 19.
   ``Let them try as they might, they cannot create statutes where
none exist,'' Lowell said.
   He said he thought Keating had been charged as the result of
hysteria over the nation's savings and loan crisis by well-meaning
but mistaken prosecutors.
   ``I think that the district attorney is a little bit confused
about who the wrongdoers are,'' he said.
   Ito allowed to stand 20 counts alleging that bonds were sold to
Lincoln Savings investors by means of untrue statements or
omissions of material facts.
   Ito ordered the attorneys to return on Dec. 3 for another
hearing. The defense said they would pursue additional motions to
dismiss the case at that time, no matter how many charges are
allowed to stand then.

   Mazda Motor of America on Friday recalled
2,708 RX-7s because three of the sports cars may have defective
airbags.
   The automaker has been notified by airbag manufacturer TRW that
there might be three defective airbags among RX-7s manufactured
between Nov. 1, 1989, and July 2, 1990, said Mazda spokesman Bob
Marsocci.
   ``There's a mechanism that senses when there's an impact and
that module might be defective,'' he said. The recall was
voluntary.
   Owners are being notified by mail to take their cars to Mazda
dealers for inspections. If necessary, the airbags will be replaced
at no cost.
   Mazda said it was not aware of any injuries that have resulted
from any defective airbags.

   More than half the securities fraud charges
against Charles H. Keating Jr. were jeopardized by a judge who said
they cannot stand as written.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said Friday that in 20 of the 42
counts against the Arizona developer and three co-defendants, the
indictment appeared to be lacking. He said two other counts
violated the defendants' right to due process because they were too
vague.
   Keating, the former head of American Continental Corp., was
jailed for 33 days on a 42-count indictment. He posted a reduced
bond of $300,000 last month.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Fear of war in the Persian Gulf jolted oil
prices for the third straight month in October, but slowing
economic growth held wholesale price inflation for non-food and
non-energy items to zero.
   The Labor Department said Friday its Producer Price Index for
finished goods, one step short of retail, jumped a seasonally
adjusted 1.1 percent last month.
   That followed increases of 1.6 percent in September and 1.3
percent in August, bringing the annual inflation rate for the year
so far to levels not seen in nine years.

but most predict it will be brief and relatively mild, a prominent
economic newsletter reported.
   Blue Chip Economic Indicators said 80 percent of the 55
economists in its survey, released Friday, feel a downturn will
start before the end of 1990. Another 5 percent said the slump
would start in 1991.

   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Saudi Arabia expects to be producing
8.5 million barrels of oil a day soon and is considering expanding
its oil industry to put out 10 million barrels a day despite the
threat of war with Iraq.
   Saddam Hussein has threatened to devastate the kingdom's main
oilfields in the northeastern desert if the U.S.-dominated
multinational force in Saudi Arabia launches an offensive to
liberate occupied Kuwait.
   The Saudis have already raised their oil output to 8.2 million
barrels a day, a 10-year high and a 57 percent increase since Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal savings and loan regulators may seek up
to $10 billion from Drexel Burhnam Lambert Inc. for junk bond
investment losses at more than 20 thrifts, people involved in the
case said.
   A lawyer for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the
Resolution Trust Corp. said Friday that ``very substantial claims''
would be filed next week against the collapsed Wall Street firm now
in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.
   The claims are to be negotiated along with dozens of other civil
actions in the bankruptcy reorganization.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said it was boosting
advertising rates for 1991 at The Wall Street Journal, the nation's
largest daily newspaper.
   At the same time, the company said Friday it was closing the
composing operations at its printing plant in Naperville, Ill., and
transferring the plant's responsibilities to a plant in Dallas, for
a net reduction of 30 jobs.
   The moves come as Dow Jones begins an austerity program under
which it has frozen capital spending, is trying to hold salary
spending in 1991 at 1990 levels and is taking other steps to cut
costs.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush has vetoed a bill intended to
block drug companies from reaping windfall profits through
monopolistic marketing of drugs that treat rare diseases.
   The bill, vetoed Friday, applies to ``orphan drugs'' used
against diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 people. It was
designed to foster more competition by eliminating the seven-year
exclusive marketing rights granted under current law to companies
that develop such drugs.

<HEAD>Largest Minority-Owned Bank In the Country Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government declared the Freedom National
Bank of New York insolvent Friday, closing what local officials
called the largest minority-owned bank in the country.
   The bank had assets of $101.9 million. Its main branch was in
Harlem and two others were in Brooklyn.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the federal agency that
closed the bank, by law must reimburse depositors with holdings up
to $100,000 each.
   However, about 100 of the bank's accounts exceed the $100,000
limit, totaling $11 million. Those uninsured depositors will share
with the FDIC the proceeds of liquidating the failed bank's assets.
   The FDIC said there were no bids by other banks to take over the
Freedom National Bank.
   The bank has a total of 22,000 accounts in which $90.8 million
had been deposited.
   Debts and liabilities owed by the bank but secured by various
types of collateral total about $9.1 million.
   In a statement, Mayor David Dinkins expressed regret over the
bank's closing. He said it was the largest minority-owned U.S.
banking company.
   ``Since its founding in 1964, Freedom has served as the
financial backbone of the Harlem community at a time when few other
institutions showed much interest in doing business there,''
Dinkins said in a statement.
   ``Over its 26 years, it has provided loans and safeguarded the
deposits of thousands of neighborhood residents and businesses.''
   Dinkins said the city has accounts at the bank that totaled
$300,000 Sept. 30, but that the money is in separate accounts of no
more than $100,000 each and is therefore protected.
   Deposits up to the $100,000 limit will be made available to
account holders starting Tuesday. The FDIC had not yet determined
where the reimbursements would be made.
