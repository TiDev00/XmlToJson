   Humphrey, the wayward whale who captured
the nation's heart while wandering through San Francisco Bay five
years ago, got stuck on mudflats and then on a submerged rock in
the bay Monday.
   Worried rescuers tried coax the mammoth mammal off the rock and
out to sea.
   ``This could be very serious when the tide goes out,'' said
Peigin Barrett, spokeswoman for the California Marine Mammal
Center. ``However, we are not sure if it's stuck on the rock or
just wants to stay there.''
   Humphrey, a humpback whale, spent 25 days in the fall of 1985
swimming - seemingly lost - in San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento
Delta before being guided back to the Pacific.
   Rescuers used everything from underwater explosives to recorded
whale sounds to convince the whale to head for open water.
   Humphrey's earlier visit drew legions of fans and national media
attention, and became became the subject of songs, poems, books and
T-shirts.
   ``It's definitely, definitely Humphrey,'' Barrett said of the
whale that grounded on a rock shortly after freeing itself from
mudflats near Candlestick Park south of downtown.
   Barrett said the identification was made by Ken Belcomb of the
Washington-based Center for Whale Research Whale Research through
distinctive markings. Humpbacks often are identified by tail
markings.
   The whale, measuring 40 feet long and weighing up to 40 tons,
was first spotted in about three feet of water on mudflats near
U.S. Highway 101. Traffic backed up a motorists stopped to watch
the whale, not then identified as Humphrey, struggle, then swim
free as the tide rose.
   It then got stuck, partly out of the water, on the submerged
rock a short distance offshore. Rescuers worked to get Humphrey
headed out of the bay and into the ocean. They feared it could dry
out or crush itself by its own massive weight unless completely
supported by water.
   The Coast Guard kept boats in the area to help out.
   Belcomb has followed Humphrey's exploits since the 1985 visit.
Since then, Barrett said, Humphrey has been spotted in the ocean
near San Francisco every year in August or September.
   Barrett said that while other species of whale appear in San
Francisco Bay, it is rare for the endangered humpbacks to do so. In
most cases, the animal is hurt or sick, she said.
   ``When it was beached there was no observation of any kind of
mark or injury ... so we think in all likelihood that if there was
a problem with it, it was internal,'' Barrett said, adding it was
``very possible'' the whale was ill.

<TEXT>
   King Fahd and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt met for talks
Monday in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, on Iraq's occupation of Kuwait,
diplomatic sources said, as world capitals buzzed with reports that
the Saudis were talking concessions.
   On Sunday, Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan insisted on an
unconditional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, but suggested that in the
post-withdrawal stage, negotiations could be held to consider
Iraq's long-standing border dispute with Kuwait.
   The prince said that ``rights, whether valid or doubtful'' could
always be discussed, but only after Iraqi withdrawal.
   Some reports quoted Sultan as saying Arab nations were willing
to grant Iraq ``all its rights,'' but a reporter for The Associated
Press who covered the speech said ``all rights'' was not mentioned.
   Some quarters took the prince's remarks as a sign that the
Saudis were ready to agree to territorial concessions by Kuwait.
This was a factor in oil prices plunging $5.41 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, to close at $28.38.
   Before invading Kuwait on Aug. 2, Iraq demanded territorial and
financial concessions from the oil-rich emirate, including claims
to the Kuwaiti islands of Warba and Bubiyan on the Persian Gulf and
to the Rumailah oil field. Most of the field is in Iraq but a
disputed section runs two miles inside Kuwait.
   Speculation grew so intense about the Saudi position that the
information office of the Saudi Embassy in Washington issued a
release Monday titled: ``Clarification of Statements Made by His
Royal Highness Prince Sultan.''
   It said that Sultan ``declared to the Saudi Press Agency today
(Monday) that some news agencies have wrongly interpreted certain
elements of his speech addressing the Arab journalists on Sunday .
. . and their analysis contained a clear distortion of the intended
meaning.
   ``To clarify the misinterpretation, His Royal Highness said that
he meant to convey that . . . Saudi Arabia has in the past, through
good will, resolved its respective border problems with Iraq,
Jordan and the United Arab Emirates by cordial and mutual
understanding.
   ``Regarding the Iraqi aggression on sisterly Kuwait, the Kingdom
declared its absolute rejection of the said aggression, and
reiterates its total commitment to all Arab and international
resolutions calling upon Iraq to immediately, completely, and
unconditionally withdraw from Kuwaiti territory, and restore its
legitimacy under the leadership of HRH Prince Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah.''
   The diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia, speaking on condition of
not being further identified, said Fahd and Mubarak agreed that
Iraqi withdrawal and restoring the al-Sabah family rule in Kuwait
could be followed by negotiations on the bilateral disputes that
preceded the invasion.
   Mubarak met Fahd at the Saudi resort of Jiddah on the Red Sea.
The Egyptian leader arrived Monday and visited Egyptian troops
deployed with multinational troops after Iraq invaded Kuwait and
massed troops on the Saudi border.
   The two agreed that continued Iraqi refusal to withdraw from
Kuwait would hurt the Arab world's leading cause - the Palestinian
problem, the sources said.
   ``They saw that the continued Iraqi refusalto respond to peace
calls will harden the splits in Arab ranks and dissipate the Arab
and international concern about the principal Arab cases led by the
Palestinian problem and the situation in Lebanon,'' one diplomatic
source said.
   Mubarak went to the northeastern region of Hafr al-Batin at the
start of a visit to Saudi Arabia, his first overseas trip since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He is to go to the United Arab Emirates
on Tuesday.
   At least 14,000 Egyptian troops are deployed to the
multinational forces. Mubarak has said the number might increase,
and Maj. Gen. Mohammed Ali Bilal, the Egyptian commander in the
kingdom, said he expects the size of Egypt's force here to reach
20,000 by the end of October.
   The forces from Western, Islamic, Arab and gulf countries number
about 300,000. The Iraqi force assembled in and around Kuwait since
the invasion has exceeded 400,000.
   Sultan had told a gathering of Saudi newspaper editors Sunday
that anything short of an unconditional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait
and return of the Al-Sabah family to power ``is unacceptable and
rejected by the gulf states in particular and by most of the Arab
and world nations.''
   He said he was troubled by the suffering trade sanctions were
causing Iraqis, but convinced that was a far better thing than war.
   ``It causes us deep pain to see the Iraqi or any other nation
facing a worldwide trade embargo,'' he said. ``But the premise for
the embargo is peace, not war. Perhaps it is meant to spare the
shedding of Iraqi blood.''
   Prince Sultan, third in the Saudi leadership after Fahd and
Crown Prince Abdullah, said the foreign forces amassed following
the invasion of Kuwait ``brought an umbrella of peace.''
   He denied any plans to form an Arab-Western security alliance in
the region. ``It is not acceptable that an Arab country enters into
an alliance with a non-Arab foreign power,'' he said.

   Oil prices plunged on the world market Monday on raised
prospects for peace in the Middle East following a report of a
dream in which the Prophet Mohammed supposedly appeared before
Saddam Hussein and the Saudi defense minister hinted at territorial
concessions.
   An oil price drop for any reason was upbeat news for the U.S.
economy, and more welcome news came from the leader of an
Iraqi-American group, who said Saddam will free some sick and
elderly Americans from among the hundreds of U.S. citizens held by
Baghdad since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   It was not immediately clear when the releases might come, or
how many Americans would be affected.
   ``We don't want to talk about figures or names at the moment,
but I'm happy to announce that some good news will come up,'' said
Salim Mansour, leader of the Maryland-based Iraqi-American
Foundation.
   Oil prices fell $5.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, closing at $28.38 - the biggest one-day drop in exchange
history. In London, North Sea Brent Blend oil plunged $5.65 a
barrel to close at $26.75.
   The prices dropped following reported remarks by Saudi Arabia's
defense minister Sunday that Arab nations were willing to grant
Iraq ``all its rights.'' The market interpreted that as a sign
Saudi Arabia was prepared to agree to territorial concessions by
Kuwait.
   The same day, however, Prince Sultan reiterated that ``any
solution must provide for an unconditional Iraqi pullout from
Kuwait and the return of the rule of the al-Sabah family,''
   A reporter who covered the speech for The Associated Press said
the prince declared that ``rights, whether valid or doubtful''
could always be discussed, but only after Iraqi withdrawal - with
no mention of ``all rights.''
   Also reported as figuring in the oil price drop was a dream
President Saddam supposedly had. The Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Seyassah
said Saddam dreamed Mohammed appeared before him and told Saddam
Iraq's missiles ``were pointed in the wrong direction.'' The
missiles are pointed south toward Saudi Arabia, where hundreds of
thousands of Western forces have massed since the invasion.
   Al-Seyassah said Iraqi intelligence was spreading the story
around Baghdad in an apparent attempt to prepare Iraqis
psychologically for a pullout from Kuwait.
   The report could not be independently confirmed. Al-Seyassah is
an arm of the ousted government of Kuwait, and has been trying to
discredit Saddam.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, oil prices have fluctuated
wildly on world markets, passing $40 a barrel at times compared
with precrisis levels of $22 a barrel.
   In other developments:
   -The State Department said Monday that Iraqi military forces
captured most of Kuwait's arsenal of U.S. Hawk anti-aircraft
missiles and evidently are trying to learn how to use the weapons.
   -Britain said Iraqi troops in Kuwait rounded up seven more
British citizens and were to transfer them to Iraq.
   -A handwritten letter from Americans and other Westerners
detained at strttegic sites in Iraq reached a Western embassy on
Monday in Baghdad, diplomats said. In it, the captives complained
about their treatment.
   -President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, whose country is the leading
Arab contributor to the multinational force, visited his troops in
Saudi Arabia and met King Fahd.
   In Baghdad, Mansour, leader of the Iraqi-American group, said he
received a commitment from Saddam to release Americans. He said his
group met the Iraqi leader Sunday night.
   It was not immediately clear whether Mansour was referring to
Americans held in both Iraq and Kuwait, which Saddam annexed after
his invasion. Saddam considers Kuwait Iraq's 19th province.
   About 700 Americans are held in Kuwait and more than 300 in
Iraq, many at strategic sites to deter a possible attack by
multinational forces.
   Western diplomatic sources said they had no independent
confirmation, but understood ``that what Mansour is saying could
turn out to be true.''
   In Washington, the State Department had no comment.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
understood the Americans to be freed were ``sick or elderly.'' They
said 47 to 57 American captives fit this category.
   Saddam also appeared to make concessions to France. In a letter
Monday to Parliament, Saddam asked legislators to discuss freeing
French nationals, saying such a move would be a sign of Iraq's
friendship with France.
   More than 300 French citizens are held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   French leaders have favored linking a solution to the gulf
crisis with negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over
Israeli-occupied territory. Saddam has tried to make the same
linkage.
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said release of
French nationals was ``not negotiable.''
   To enforce the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq, a multinational naval
force has been patrolling the gulf. It has searched numerous
commercial ships, and in a dozen cases warships have fired shots to
halt suspected transgressors.
   In the latest incident, American and Australian sailors halted
and boarded an Iraqi freighter, Al-Bahar al-Arabi, that ignored
warning shots and defied orders to return to Iraq, said White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   But the ship, which Fitzwater earlier said was carrying steel
and plywood, was later found without cargo and allowed to continue
to Aden, Yemen, the Pentagon said.
   It said it assumed the crew dumped the cargo over the side.

   Country singer George Jones was
hospitalized Monday with bronchitis, a hospital spokesman said.
   The performer known for such ballads as ``He Stopped Loving Her
Today'' was being treated by his personal physician at Huntsville
Hospital, said Burr Ingram, a hospital spokesman.
   The hospital didn't list a condition for Jones said Ingram, who
described his ailment as ``a flu-like bronchitis condition.''
   He said Jones didn't appear seriously ill: ``He walked in and
was admitted.''
   Jones battled alcoholism and drug problems in the 1970s and
early 1980s. He was married to Tammy Wynette from 1969 to 1975 and
recorded duets with her including ``Golden Ring,'' ``Near You'' and
``Southern California.''
   Jones performed with Randy Travis and Ms. Wynette at the Country
Music Association Awards show Oct. 8 in Nashville, Tenn.
   The singer was born in Saratoga, Texas, and was a house painter
until becoming a full-time performer in the mid-1950s. He is known
for honky tonk songs, many of them about two-timing women.

   George Armelagos sees nothing sick
about his hobby - collecting airline barf bags.
   The University of Florida anthropologist has more than 100
(unused) barf bags of varying sizes, designs and colors on the
bulletin board of his office.
   ``All artifacts of a culture give clues about a way of life,''
he said. ``Barf bags, which after all represent food and sickness,
shoud be no different.''
   The British Airways bag gives terribly proper instructions: ``If
used for air sickness, please hand to the cabin crew for
disposal.''
   ``In other words, don't leave it on the seat,'' Armelagos said.
   Armelagos' favorite bag, from KLM Airlines, depicts a kangaroo
throwing up in his pouch. It reads, ``For a clean feeling.''
   Air Afrique's barf bag is decorated with gold masks, Aero Peru's
with archaeological symbols. Passengers can play gin rummy on the
gameboard on a TWA barf bag or use the Kodak ad on an American
Airlines bag to get their film developed.
   ``One of the biggest problems in collecting barf bags now is
that more and more airlines are starting to use generics,''
Armelagos said. ``I feel cheated when I get on a plane and find the
same barf bag that I saw on some other flight.''

<HEAD>CBS Lost a Bundle on the World Series</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cincinnati Reds' sweep of the Oakland A's in
the World Series cost CBS a bundle.
   Oakland lost the series in four straight games, meaning CBS,
which paid $1.08 billion for the rights to four years of baseball,
lost the revenue from three unplayed games and had only 14 of a
potential 21 postseason games to broadcast.
   Industry estimates put the loss as high as $150 million.
   ``We could use a little better luck, for sure,'' said CBS Sports
President Neal Pilson, who put the loss significantly lower.
``Under $100 million is, I think, a reasonable guess at this
point.''
   John Reidy, a media analyst for Smith Barney, estimated CBS'
overall fourth-quarter loss at more than $50 million, with an
overall loss for the year of about $100 million.
   ``If they had gotten three more games, we figure they could have
had an increased contribution to their profits on the order of $15
million to $20 million without too much difficulty,'' Reidy said.
   In 1990, all major sports contracts were up for renewal and CBS
was looking to break out of its third-place prime-time standing
with aggressive bidding.
   CBS' $1.08 billion for baseball was part of a $3.6 billion
package for NFL football, NCAA tournament basketball and the next
two Winter Olympics.
   ``They bid up the price of prime-time sports too high to support
the business that's out there,'' said John Rohr, a programming
analyst for Blair Television, advertising representative for TV
stations. ``There's a lot more supply nowadays than there is
demand.''
   The network boasted that 1990 would be a ``Dream Season,'' with
its would broadcasts of the Super Bowl, basketball's Final Four
college championships and the pros' NBA championships, the All-Star
Game, tennis' U.S. Open and the World Series.
   ``The Dream Season turned into a nightmare of blowouts, sweeps
and rain delays,'' said CBS spokeswoman Susan Kerr.
   In the Super Bowl, the San Francisco '49ers obliterated the
Denver Broncos 55-10; the University of Las Vegas won the Final
Four in a 103-73 blowout of Duke University, and the NBA's Detroit
Pistons won their title in five games.
   ``These are things we can't control,'' Pilson said.
   CBS' baseball dream began going bad when the owners' lockout
delayed the season for nearly a month. Rain delayed the All-Star
Game for more than an hour, pushing the final innings into the
small hours.
   ``All of our sports, including baseball up through the World
Series, performed better than projected in terms of the bottom
line,'' Pilson said. ``But what we ran into was a fourth-quarter
softness in the overall economy. It wasn't just television and it
wasn't just sports television.''
   Baseball's truncated playoffs hurt. The first National League
playoff game between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati was the lowest-rated
in history. Ratings for the six prime-time playoff games declined
10 percent from last year.
   This year's World Series ratings were better than last year's
earthquake-delayed championship, which got an all-time low rating
of 16.4 mostly because both teams came from the same, smaller media
market.
   The '90 Series' overnight ratings averaged 21.3 - up about 25
percent over last year, but still second-lowest since night games
were added in 1971.
   Oakland and Cincinnati are not New York- or L.A.-size markets.
``No disrespect to Oakland or Cincinnati, but the only thing I can
think of that would be worse for a series would be Toronto versus
Montreal,'' Rohr said.

   Roughly 150 dozen times on this typical
day, Debbie Slade will check the seams, the snaps, the fabric and
the measurements of baby pajamas before sticking on her signature:
``Inspected by No. 6.''
   But then, life is full of inspections.
   She's got exams to think about in her night classes. She's got
to keep the pounds off, working out on the exercise bike her
husband bought her. And in a year or two, she hopes to have that
first granddaughter the families are looking for.
   ``Everybody's pushing us to have that granddaughter. It's all
boys,'' Inspector No. 6 says amid the clatter of sewing, cutting
and fastening machines in the Gerber Childrenswear plant. A box of
three dozen completed outfits has just been added to the
never-finished pile next to her 4-by-6-foot work table.
   This time, they're hot-pink affairs, tiny ``fashion sleepers.''
She'll get to that box next, visualizing the wearer. ``You can just
picture the little girl, with the little bows and everything,'' she
says.
   Inspector No. 6 laughs, but she doesn't pause. Hands tugging
seams and probing terrycloth toes, she works at what seems a
double-time pace, like nearly everyone at the plant, where pay is
usually by the piece.
   The infant clothes are created by dozens of seamstresses arrayed
in rows in a room the size of a football field. Some wear stereo
earphones to drown the sewing machines' whir and the snare
drum-like cracks as ``gripper girls'' pound metal snaps into place.
Some talk over the noise.
   ``Peggy, you feelin' good today?''
   ``I'm feeling all right.''
   Some spend all day making nothing but collars, others nothing
but sleeves or cuffs, to be passed along to the next seamstress,
who with a quick arc of stitches attaches that part to the evolving
garment.
   By the time all the pattern pieces finally come together as
pajamas, they've reached 28-year-old Debbie Slade and the other
``100 percent inspectors.''
   Inside-out and unsnapped, the outfits quickly are reversed,
snapped, checked and sent by the inspectors on their way, in one of
three directions.
   Most go toward the packagers, to be placed in boxes marked
``Crafted With Pride in the USA.'' Others go back to sewing
machines to have minor irregularities mended. Some, with faded
fabric or a leg that's too wide, go to the seconds box.
   First, however, the outfits that pass inspection go to Frances
Martin, the plant's quality assurance manager. Years ago, she was
Inspector No. 10 at another plant.
   All day, she roves among the seamstresses, checking,
occasionally turning a garment back to be resewn. ``But Frances,''
Sandra Brake jokingly protests from behind her machine, ``I crafted
it with pride.''
   Occasionally, there's some friction when a garment is rejected,
acknowledges quality control executive David Sanders. That's
because the piece-work seamstress loses production time. ``You
can't make money doing repairs,'' he says.
   Mrs. Martin also inspects the inspectors, sending reports on to
Sanders. She pulls a set percentage of outfits from the dozens they
examine and gets out her ruler ``to make sure they're meeting
specifications.''
   Sleeve: 10\ inches long. Neck: 5 inches across. Another
inspection for Inspector No. 6. On this day, her sheet in Mrs.
Martin's log shows a perfect score.
   ``Most people, when they ask me, `What do you do?' and I say,
`I'm an inspector,' they say, `Do you inspect Hanes?' - you know,
the underwear inspector,'' No. 6 says, laughing again, recalling
the television commercial of a few years ago.
   In it, a no-nonsense Inspector No. 12 tugs the elastic of briefs
before growling into the camera: ``They don't say Hanes until I say
they say Hanes.''
   Inspector No. 6 feels similiarly proprietary.
   With sharp nippers that have left scars on her fingertips in
five years at this job, she cuts extraneous threads while telling a
story.
   A new mother wrote a letter complaining about an uncut string,
an inconsequential matter until it gets wrapped around a baby's
toe. The infant wasn't hurt, but Mrs. Slade says the message
registered. ``It was a dangerous thing,'' she says.
   Plant managers pass such problems back to those assigned to
catch them. Whose inspector label turned up isn't mentioned. ``They
just talk to all of us about it,'' No. 6 says, and she's not
smiling now.
   ``Tell me if it's mine,'' she says. ``I know I put labels in
mine 'cause I want to know.''
   Debbie Slade doesn't plan to be Inspector No. 6 forever - she's
closing in on a degree in fashion merchandise and marketing.
   What'll she do next? Become a buyer for a store? Stay with
Gerber? She's not sure. But the clothing business is in her blood
now.
   ``I'm the type,'' she says, ``that when I buy something I
inspect it now, even for myself. ... I want to know what I'm
getting.''

   Tired of living like a starving artist,
Oslo's Munch museum is putting its collection up for adoption.
   The director of the city-owned museum for works by Norwegian
artist Edvard Munch hopes companies and individuals will pay
between $833 and $16,500 - plus annual support payments - for one
of a selection of 1,100 paintings.
   The donors, however, will only have visiting rights because all
works will remain in the museum.
   Museum director Alf Boe said the money is needed to expand and
modernize the 27-year-old building. The first appeals were expected
to be mailed today.
   Finances in Norway's capital city have been strained by a
national economic slump. Not even the sale of some works fattened
the museum's coffers enough for the project.
   ``Oslo's budget is so thin that we are completely dependent on
getting some extra income,'' Boe said Monday at a news conference
held in a cafe Munch once called his livingroom.
   The cafe claims it kept Munch from starving by stretching his
credit ``a very long way.''
   Munch's work was a primary inspiration for German
expressionists. His dream-like and often violent style explored
such themes as isolation, fear and death.
   When he died in 1944, Munch left paintings, sketches and
lithographs to his native city of Oslo, called Christiania when
Munch was born in 1863.
   Boe said appeals to adopt the paintings would be sent to
companies beginning today. The cry for help is accompanied by a
postcard featuring ``The Shriek,'' Munch's famous 1893 painting.
   ``We can't expect all of them to be adopted,'' said Boe, who
noted numerous Norwegian firms and a Japanese company have
expressed an interest in adopting. Boe said there will be no
placards saying who adopted the works.
   The director refused to guess how much the adoption might raise,
but said the museum needs $2.5 million for an addition and $8.3
million for renovations, including a cold-storage room to keep
prints from deteriorating.
   Boe said the museum also needs funds to rebuild its staff, cut
from a peak of 65 to 47.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Squeezes Out Rivals, Karrubi Emerges as Radical Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is
intensifying his purge of anti-Western radical rivals in a power
struggle that looks to be heating up against the backdrop of the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   The outcome, at this stage, does not seem to be in doubt:
Rafsanjani is gradually consolidating his power.
   But he needs to force the pace to maintain the momentum of his
effort to liberalize Iran's economy and society after the June 1989
death of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists, is seeking to
improve the quality of life for Iran's 55 million people to cement
his popularity. He also seeks to rebuild bridges with the West and
the Arabs.
   But rearguard actions by the radicals can slow down his campaign
and jeopardize his strategy.
   Rafsanjani's latest target is Mehdi Karrubi, hardline Speaker of
the 270-member Majlis, or Parliament.
   The Majlis is dominated by the radicals, and with elections at
least 18 months away, Rafsanjani has to do something to contain
them.
   Since the death of Khomeini, who was known as the Imam,
Rafsanjani has systematically removed many radicals and
ultra-conservative clerics from the government and key
institutions.
   ``This reactionary tendency has grown since the Imam's demise
and is now coveting total power,'' radical parliamentarian Abbas
Douzdouzani declared last week. ``It is feared that it will destroy
all revolutionary achievements and aspirations under the guise of
religious rules and put American-style Islam in control.''
   Rafsanjani's supporters now control the 12-member Council of
Guardians, which screens legislation to ensure it conforms to
Islamic tenets, and the 13-man Expediency Council, established by
Khomeini to resolve legislative issues.
   Earlier this month, Rafsanjani gained control of the 83-member
Assembly of Experts, one of the most important institutions in
Iran, through a piece of political trickery that has enraged the
hard-liners.
   Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as spiritual
leader, has also come under heavy criticism for siding with
Rafsanjani. The radicals say he's unfit to be Khomeini's successor
because he lacks Islamic credentials.
   The radicals claim to be Khomeini's true heirs and accuse
Rafsanjani and Khamenei of straying from Khomeini's teachings.
   The Iraq-based Iranian opposition group, Mujahedeen Khalq, or
People's Holy Warriors, say Khamenei has threatened to use his
constitutional powers and dissolve Parliament if attacks against
him continue.
   Their claim could not be independently confirmed, but sources in
Tehran have said Rafsanjani made similar threats when the radicals
tried to block his five-year economic plan in January.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has strengthened Rafsanjani's hand.
Higher oil prices are earning Iran an extra $35 million a day,
badly needed for his drive to revive the economy.
   Saddam Hussein was forced to make peace with Iran, his foe in a
1980-88 war, withdraw from captured territory and share sovereignty
of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms part of the Iran-Iraq
border and was Iraq's lone outlet to the Persian Gulf before it
seized Kuwait.
   But the American military intervention in the region, coupled
with Iranian suspicions that the troops could remain indefinitely
even if Saddam quits Kuwait, has given radicals a political boost.
   The radicals remain deeply entrenched in the bureaucracy and
revolutionary institutions, such as the security committees which
control life in the streets.
   Karrubi, a middle-ranking cleric known for his aggressive
fundamentalism, has emerged as one of the government's chief
antagonists.
   Authorities arrested his brother, Hassan, on corruption charges
last month.
   Last week, Khamenei ordered Ali Yunessi, Tehran's public
prosecutor, to investigate the multimillion-dollar Martyr's
Foundation, which Karrubi heads.
   The foundation, which looks after the families of men killed in
the war, has become a virtual conglomerate, running companies, real
estate and other assets expropriated from supporters of the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
   In an open letter to Ayatollah Yussof Saneie, a senior
hard-liner who the radicals say is more qualified than Khamenei to
be spiritual leader, Karrubi called Khamenei and the moderates
``devourers of the Imam's legacy.''
   The feud sharpened earlier this month over the elections for the
Assembly of Experts. The hard-liners had sought to win enough seats
to replace Khamenei with a radical troika led by Saneie.
   But Khamenei and Rafsanjani cut the hard-liners out by changing
the rules for candidates and making them undergo examinations to
test their knowledge of Islamic religious teachings.
   Many radicals who had announced their candidacy, like Karrubi,
refused to take the test. Most of those who did were flunked,
giving Rafsanjani's supporters an easy victory.

   In a county where fence posts outnumber
people, the signs on the posts tell what people are thinking:
``Boyd County Held Hostage,'' ``Dump the Dump Queen,'' and
``PinnochiOrr.''
   They aren't the only blemishes on the pastoral landscape in the
sparsely populated ranchland among the rolling foothills of the
Niobrara River in northeastern Nebraska.
   Since a developer named a site near Butte last December as its
choice for a five-state low-level radioactive waste warehouse, a
rancher who opposes the dump has staged a 30-day hunger strike and
Gov. Kay Orr has received a death threat.
   The dump has divided neighbors and even families in Boyd County,
a slice of farm country along the South Dakota line about 200 miles
north of Lincoln. And now, it has become part of the governor's
race between Mrs. Orr, the nation's first Republican woman to be
elected governor, and her Democratic challenger, Ben Nelson.
   Mrs. Orr has been called ``PinnochiOrr'' after the storybook
puppet whose nose grew when he lied. She supports the dump, but
opponents say she lies by saying that most community residents
agree with her.
   Nelson, who opposes the dump, has been accused of making
political hay out of the situation.
   Nebraska is one of the states farthest along on the road to
complying with a federal law that requires all states to dispose of
their own low-level radioactive waste by Jan. 1, 1993.
   The law allows states to form associations to dispose of the
waste. Nebraska belongs to the Central Interstate Low-level
Radioactive Waste Compact with Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana and
Oklahoma.
   Nelson and other opponents say there is some doubt that the
nation needs more dumps. They also say that only California and
Nebraska appear to be trying to comply with federal guidelines.
   Mrs. Orr's legal aide, Bud Cuca, said the governor wants to
introduce measures in the January legislative session to ensure
that other states have complied with federal law before Nebraska
issues a license for the dump.
   The state has already begun a yearlong review of the license
application by US Ecology.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Orr said she wouldn't be campaigning in
Boyd County, which has about 3,000 residents, because she had
received a death threat. The Nebraska State Patrol said it was
investigating the letter that Mrs. Orr received last August.
   ``I don't believe that Gov. Kay Orr is afraid to come to Boyd
County. I think she is ashamed to come to Boyd County,'' said Jim
Selle, a founder of the anti-dump group Save Boyd County and member
of a monitoring committee appointed to oversee development of the
waste site.
   Some Boyd County officials have welcomed the money the dump may
bring. Opponents have said they fear accidents and long-term
effects of the waste.
   ``You have a county with one great big, broken heart and nobody
seems to care,'' said Lowell Fisher of Spencer, a town about 10
miles from the waste site.
   Fisher, 50, lost 36 pounds when he staged a month-long hunger
strike that began Sept. 17.
   He declined to say why he ended his fast Thursday or if he
considered the battle against the dump to be lost.
   Fisher says there are children in Boyd County who no longer
speak to their parents because of disagreements over the dump. Dump
officials say one of the regular protesters at the fenced-in site
is the father of one of the guards hired to protect it.
   Guards have complained that they have been harassed; barbed wire
on fences has been cut, and tire spikes have been found on work
roads. Jim Neal, a US Ecology spokesman, says residents near the
project who support it have had their fences cut and their cattle
have gotten loose.
   Last month, a grand jury noted the difficulty of finding people
for a monitoring committee to oversee work at the site. The reason:
Nearly everyone in the county had too strong an opinion to take an
objective view.

   Americans holed up in the U.S. Embassy
fight boredom by watching old war movies on video, playing chess
and pumping iron. Mostly, they try to keep their spirits up.
   They are among more than 1,000 Americans prevented from leaving
Iraq and Kuwait because Saddam Hussein's government wants human
shields against attacks by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the
Persian Gulf.
   About 600 foreigners, including 104 Americans, have been taken
to strategic locations in Iraq that would be most vulnerable to air
attacks, according to diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Americans are among several thousand foreigners stranded or
held in Iraq since Saddam's forces seized Kuwait on Aug. 2. Saddam
calls them ``guests'' who will remain in Iraq ``until the clouds
roll by and the sky once again becomes clear.''
   ``We understand that the Americans have been scattered
everywhere, practically at every strategic location,'' said an
Asian diplomat. ``We know that some of them are sick, probably
suffering from diarrhea,'' he added. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The hostages at the sites have been denied visits by officials
from their embassies and are being moved from place to place,
sources said.
   ``We want to start a mail service where we can forward and
receive mail from them,'' said William Armbruster, 37, a U.S.
diplomat at the embassy.
   The embassy is also printing a weekly newsletter giving
summaries of world news and football and baseball results.
   ``We're handing over these papers to the Iraqis, requesting them
to forward them,'' Armbruster said.
   Some Americans and other foreigners stranded in Baghdad are ill
and urgently need medical care.
   ``I have 48 documented cases,'' said Laurence Vellekoop, an
American doctor who had been assigned to the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait. Like many other Americans, he left Kuwait for Iraq after
the invasion.
   Vellekoop said some of the trapped Americans suffer from serious
heart disorders, ulcers, diabetes and severe backaches. One
American said he is anxious to leave because his 80-year-old mother
is going blind.
   Salim Mansour, leader of an American-Iraqi delegation that met
with Saddam, said Monday he received a commitment from the Iraqi
leadership to release some ailing and elderly Americans.
   ``We don't want to talk about figures or names at the moment,
but I'm happy to announce that some good news will come up,''
Mansour said.
   About 650 Americans were living in Iraq when Saddam's forces
captured the ermirate. As many as 2,700 Americans were working in
Kuwait. Some Americans received Iraqi permission to leave, and
others found their own way out.
   Embassy officials decline to say how many Americans remain in
Iraq and Kuwait or how many have taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy.
But there are believed to be 54 diplomats and dependents in the
U.S. compound.
   Two Iraqi soldiers keep watch outside the walled embassy and the
U.S. Information Service office across the street. Iraqi secret
service agents note who visits the embassy.
   The Americans living in the embassy compound and embassy
residences are free to move around the city. But most prefer to
stay close to home.
   ``I don't feel unsafe,'' said Armbruster. ``There's very little
anti-Americanism in the streets. Perhaps that's the contribution of
Arab hospitality.
   ``But no one talks to us as it's illegal. It's dangerous for
Iraqis to talk to foreign diplomats.''
   On the streets, young men occasionally chant ``Down, Down,
Bush!'' when they spot an American reporter.
   A 6-week-old motherless kitten has become the Americans' mascot.
   The striped gray kitten, named ``Bosh'' after the way Iraqis
pronounce President Bush's name, was found in the embassy garden by
an Iraqi secretary.
   ``Bosh will find a new home in Minneapolis if and when we make
it,'' said Vellekoop. ``Bosh would probably die if I leave him
here.''

   Marine Sgt. Randy Rodriguez says
he is ready for any attack on Iraq, but he hopes no one bombs the
capital. His brother, who was a Marine guard in Kuwait, is trapped
in Baghdad.
   ``I'm not worried - concerned, yes,'' Rodriguez said, explaining
that his 23-year-old brother Paul is a Marine and a devout
Christian. ``I know the training he went through. As a brother, I
know he is a strong man.''
   Randy, 27, said Paul had been at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait for
seven months when Iraq invaded on Aug. 2.
   When Randy was deployed near the Saudi Arabia border two weeks
later, Paul was less than 100 miles away in Kuwait.
   Since then, contact between the brothers has been spotty,
filtered by distance and delayed by military mail.
   ``He called my sister to say things were pretty shaky, and then
they (the ftamily) read in he newspaper that Americans were taken
from the embassy to Iraq,'' Randy said.
   He said Paul and other American officials were allowed to move
freely within a limited radius of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Only
civilians are being held at strategic sites as part of Saddam
Hussein's human shield against attack.
   Paul sent a letter out Sept. 14 with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and
he has been able to call his family in Orlando, Fla. The brothers'
father, the Rev. George Rodriguez, is pastor of the Spanish Church
of God.
   Randy Rodriguez joined the Marines in 1981 and served at
embassies in Uruguay, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico before
joining the 1st Force Support Services Group, which ended up in the
1st Marine Expeditionary Force in Saudi Arabia.
   Paul joined four years later and the brothers tried to stay
close.
   ``Let's see,'' Randy said, checking his watch. ``Last year at
this time we were vacationing together in Kenya.'' Paul had been at
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi.
   The wait is hardest on the brothers' teen-age sister, Randy
said, but the whole family is holding up well.
   ``I pray for them more than my brother. They all have a strong
Christian faith, strong beliefs,'' he said.
   Everything suggests that Paul is in high spirits on the other
side of the frontlines, he added.
   Rodriguez supervises fueling operations at a desert outpost.
   ``We're the local 7-Eleven,'' he said, with a light chuckle.
``There's not much else. Without us, nobody eats, moves or
shoots.''
   At quiet moments, Rodriguez plays Scrabble, writes letters and
prays for his brother. As always, there is the constant game of
guessing what happens next.
   ``We're just waiting on our boss,'' he said. ``I don't know what
will happen, but I don't see leaving here peacefully.''
   If it becomes necessary to call air strikes on Baghdad,
Rodriguez said, the family is confident.
   ``The last thing my brother shared with me was a verse from
Psalms 145:20, that for those who love the Lord, the wicked will be
destroyed,'' he said, shifting easily from wry humor to quiet
thoughtfulness.
   ``This doesn't worry me,'' he concluded. ``If I don't see my
brother again, I know I'll see him later.''

   Sarit Bakshi left a Jewish settlement in the
West Bank to escape the Palestinian uprising, but the uprising
followed her.
   A knife-wielding Arab walked into the Jewish neighborhood of
Baka at breakfast time Sunday and stabbed three Israelis to death,
one of them outside Mrs. Bakshi's house.
   ``I moved here to get away from the stones and now every morning
I have to open my shutters and see blood,'' she said.
   The people in Baka were angry and scared Monday. Extra police
were on the streets to prevent attacks on Arabs, and also were
outside the house of a neighborhood moderate who drew his
neighbor's wrath.
   More suspicion and tension clouded Baka when people awoke Monday
to find the tires slashed on 35 cars. Arab saboteurs? Jewish
provocateurs? Nobody knows.
   Stone walls were plastered with black-bordered death notices for
Sunday's victims: soldier Iris Azulai, gardener Eli Eltratz and
off-duty policeman Charles Chelouche.
   Downtown, police were questioning the suspected assailant, a
19-year-old Arab laborer named Omar Abu Sirhan. They said he was
seeking vengeance for the killings of Palestinians.
   ``This is the first time a man died in my arms and it was a
terrible thing,'' said Daniel Marciano, an unemployed tenement
dweller who heard screaming and came out to offer aid.
   He pointed to a dark patch of blood soaked into the pavement and
said:
   ``Yesterday, a Jew was lying here, another over there, on the
other side a soldier. It was a horrible thing. Take a look today -
calm. Believe me if an Arab would come no one would hurt him. We
are merciful Jews.''
   Baka straddles the Bethlehem Road leading to Christ's
birthplace. It was an Arab district until it became part of the new
state of Israel in 1948, and although most Arabs fled, it kept its
Arab name.
   Its majestic Arab houses with exquisitely carved limestone have
attracted Jerusalem's yuppies, joining other Jews who had fled Arab
countries and settled in Israel.
   Today Baka is considered a microcosm of Israel itself.
   The Palestinian uprising effectively divided Jerusalem. Few Jews
venture into the Arab sector without good reason. At the same time,
the feeling has grown that Jewish Jerusalem is safe. Sunday's
bloodshed shook that conviction.
   ``I thought it was impossible for it to happen here and it is a
devastating experience. I mean, it could have been me. This is my
neighborhood and it's very very scary,'' said Rabbi Levi
Weiman-Kelman, who moved here 15 years ago from New York.
   A survivor of Sunday's rampage was 13-year-old Amikam Kovner,
who sustained head injuries and needed eight stitches.
   His father, Michael, a painter, sat at the kitchen table of his
renovated Arab home while Amikam, back from hospital, played with a
friend.
   Michael Kovner's father was Abba Kovner, a Jewish poet and
ghetto fighter against the Nazis who came to Israel after World War
II.
   Did Michael Kovner see any link between his father's travails
and his son's narrow escape? Kovner thought, and concluded it was
``a part of the total fabric of our existence.''
   Judy Labensohn, a writer, said that the night before the attack,
Baka residents had finished turning an abandoned lot into a
playground and celebrated with a bonfire.
   ``It pulled us all together, and then boom! We didn't even have
24 hours to enjoy it,'' she said.
   Mrs. Bakshi said her 4-year-old daughter saw one of the
killings. ``At this age she already knows what a corpse is.''
   ``That's the thing about Jerusalem,'' said Mrs. Labensohn. ``The
physical space has a feeling of serenity, but it's anything but
serene. That is the illusion of Jerusalem.
   ``Even if you can see the smoke of tires burning in the Arab
sections of towns you could have still said `that's over there.'
Baka has always been so calm and peaceful. It's hard to believe it
happened here in our front yards.''

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Moratorium on Western Land Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by protests from Western states, the
Senate late Monday rejected a proposed one-year ban on selling
federal land containing gold, silver and other hard-rock minerals
to mining companies for as little as $2.50 an acre.
   The proposed temporary moratorium on issuing cheap titles to
federal mining land was sponsored by Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., who
called the practice a flagrant giveaway of public land and ``the
biggest scam still going on in America.''
   Western senators led by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said Bumpers'
proposal would devastate the U.S. mining industry and stifle
economic development in the West.
   The Bumpers proposal was defeated 50-48 as the Senate debated an
$11.7 billion appropriations bill for the Interior Department and
several other federal agencies from the Forest Service to the
Smithsonian Institution.
   A similar moratorium was previously approved by the House in its
version of the money bill. Differences will have to be reconciled
later by House and Senate negotiators.
   Under an 1872 law intended to encourage settlement of the West,
a miner can file a claim on federal land and sell its minerals
without paying royalties to the government so long as the miner
performs $100 worth of work annually.
   Miners can acquire title to the land for $2.50 to $5 an acre
with proof that a valuable deposit has been found and $500 worth of
work has been performed. The government receives no royalties,
lease fees or bonuses when the minerals are sold, and there are no
restrictions on use or sale of the land after title is obtained by
the miner.
   Bumpers said he sought the moratorium to give Congress time to
consider reforming the 1872 law, including proposals to prohibit
the sale of federal land and create a system of titles for mineral
deposits only. Bumpers also seeks provisions for payment of
royalties and land reclamation.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said it was ``plain baloney'' to
call the current system a public land giveaway, as Bumpers charged.
   ``This is a rotten deal,'' said Sen. William L. Armstrong,
R-Colo., an opponent of the moratorium proposal. ``This is a rotten
deal for the American taxpayers,'' retorted Bumpers.
   Bumpers said a recent General Accounting Office study of 20
sales since 1970 showing that federal land worth as much as $47
million was sold for $4,500 under the law.
   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, said the study by the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, was ``a piece of junk'' riddled with
inaccuracies, and that Bumpers' arguments were ``long on emotion
and short on facts.''

<HEAD>Minor Earthquake in Northern Delaware; No Damage Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northern Delaware was shaken by a rare
earthquake Monday night, but there were no immediate reports of
damage from the minor temblor, a state official said.
   Dr. Robert Jordan, state geologist and director of the Delaware
Geological Survey, said the quake occurred at 9:34 p.m. and lasted
about 20 seconds. It measured between 3.3 and 3.4 on the Richter
scale.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., the nation's prime
quake information center, put the magnitude at 2.9, said
spokeswoman Pat Jorgenson. The quake was centered 15 miles south of
Wilmington in the Delaware River Valley and was felt in that area
an  in southern New Jersey, she said.
   Kirk Lombardy, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service
in Wilmington, said his office had received many calls about a
possible earthquake.
   ``I didn't feel anything,'' he said.
   Jordan said the earthquake was just about strong enough to cause
minor damage, such as cracked plaster. Since 1972, the state has
recorded 40 earthquakes, all minor Jordan said. The worst occurred
on Feb. 28, 1973, measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale.

   Democrats are likely to bolster their majority
of governorships this year but face tough Republican resistance in
three Sunbelt states crucial to congressional redistricting.
   A state-by-state Associated Press survey showed Democrats with
credible challenges to six GOP governors and running strong races
in four other states where Republican governors are retiring.
   By contrast, no incumbent Democratic governor appears seriously
threatened. Republicans have high hopes in six states where
Democratic governors are not seeking re-election.
   All told, the AP survey found 14 races for governor and seven
Senate contests too close to call.
   Entering the campaign, the Democrats controlled the Senate by a
margin of 55 to 45. Of the nation's governors, 29 are Democrats and
21 Republicans.
   In the Senate races, Democratic incumbents Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island, Daniel Akaka of Hawaii and Tom Harkin of Iowa, and
John Kerry of Massachusetts are threatened, as are Republicans Mark
Hatfield of Oregon and Jesse Helms of North Carolina. In New
Hampshire, where Republican Sen. Gordon Humphrey is retiring,
former Sen. John Durkin, a Democrat, and GOP Rep. Bob Smith are in
a close race to succeed him.
   The great unknown this midterm election year is the impact of
voter discontent, a factor leaders of both parties agree exists to
an unusually high degree.
   ``The mood is bad and getting worse,'' said Democratic pollster
Geoff Garin. He cited the ``budget fiasco'' which he said
``confirms every worst suspicion people have about the political
system.''
   Garin predicted that ``some incumbents who've ecome complacent
because of their easy elections in the '80s are going to end up out
of work.''
   The race with the highest stakes is for governor of California,
where Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican Pete Wilson are
running neck and neck to succeed GOP Gov. George Deukmejian, who is
retiring after two terms.
   Based on preliminary Census figures, California will gain seven
new U.S. House seats in 1992. If Feinstein is elected governor, the
Democrats will draw the new district lines without interference
from Republicans.
   Wilson, re-elected to the U.S. Senate in 1988, was recruited to
run for governor as the best chance the GOP had to retain that seat
and the veto power over any redistricting plan drawn by the
Democratic legislature.
   Recent independent polls give Wilson a narrow lead, well within
the margin of error. The rivals agree on many issues, including
their support of abortion and the death penalty. Both are former
mayors, he of San Diego, she of San Francisco.
   Redistricting also is a major stake in races for governor in
Florida and Texas, the other big winners when more House seats
shift to the Sunbelt in 1992.
   Texas, where Republican Gov. William Clements is retiring, is
likely to gain three new House seats.
   Republican millionaire Clayton Williams seemed well on his way
to victory over Democrat Ann Richards in Texas. But last week a new
poll said Richards had moved to within 5 points of Williams, whose
repeated verbal gaffes may be cutting into his support.
   In Florida, which could gain four House seats, Republican Gov.
Bob Martinez got into trouble over taxes early in his first term
and then found his hard-line anti-abortion stand was also costing
him support. Former Democratic Sen. Lawton Chiles got into the race
and led in most polls. Recently the margin has narrowed and
Martinez has a big edge in money.
   Other Republican governors with tough opponents are Alabama Gov.
Guy Hunt, who is leading teachers union official Paul Hubbert;
Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, who is trailing businessman Ben Nelson;
Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden, who is in a dead heat with state treasurer
Joan Finney; Maine Gov. John McKernan, who trails former Democratic
Gov. Joseph Brennan; and Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete, who is
running far behind businessman Bruce Sundlun.
   Minnesota was the state where Republicans had high hopes of
defeating Democratic incumbent Rudy Perpich. But those hopes faded
abruptly when two young women alleged that GOP candidate Jon
Grunseth swam nude with four teen-age girls at a 1981 party.
   Grunseth denied the allegations and took a lie detector test. He
vowed to stay in the race and accused Perpich of being behind the
allegations.
   In Vermont, former Gov. Richard Snelling is favored to regain
the office he gave up six years ago and return that state to
Republican control. Republican Arliss Sturgulewski is leading in a
three-way race for governor of Alaska, where Democratic incumbent
Steve Cowper is retiring. Tony Knowles is the Democratic nominee
and former GOP Gov. Walter Hickel is running as an independent.
   In Oregon, John Frohnmayer, the Republican state attorney
general, is in a tight race against Democrat Barbara Roberts, while
the Massachusetts race between Democrat John Silber and Republican
Wlliam Weld also is a tossup.
   Former Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich, a Republican, is
leading Democrat Tony Celebrezze in the race to succeed Democrat
Richard Celeste as governor of Ohio.
   Democrat David Walters and Republican Bill Price are accusing
each other of dirty campaigning in the race to succeed Republican
Gov. Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma. Price also is attacking Walters as
a liberal who tried to ``ram Michael Dukakis down the throats'' of
Oklahomans in the 1988 presidential election.
   These are the top Senate races:
   NORTH CAROLINA - Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, is giving Helms the toughest race of his career.
Independent polls say the race is a dead heat. Gantt and Helms
differ on just about every issue.
   IOWA - Democrat Tom Harkin is battling Republican Rep. Tom Tauke
as well as an Iowa tradition of not re-electing Democratic
senators. Polls show Harkin consistently in the lead but his edge
is often well within the margin of error.
   OREGON - Republican Mark Hatfield, bidding for a fifth term, may
be the best example of a complacent incumbent. Democratic
businessman Harry Lonsdale hammered away at Hatfield for months and
the senator ignored the challenge until a recent poll showed
Lonsdale had climbed to within 6 points of the incumbent.
   HAWAII - Generally regarded as the best chance for the
Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat. Democrat Daniel Akaka was
appointed to the Senate last summer after Sen. Spark Matsunaga
died. A lackluster campaigner who held a safe House seat for seven
terms, Akaka is opposed by Republican Rep. Pat Saiki. Even Hawaii
Democrats conceded that Saiki is a far more dynamic campaigner and
has a strong chance to win in this heavily Democratic state.
   MASSACHUSETTS - Sen. John Kerry was considered a shoo-in for
re-election in this heavily Democratic state until the voters
expressed their rage in the Sept. 18 primary. Suddenly independent
polls said the race between Kerry and his Republican challenger,
Jim Rappaport, was a dead heat.
   RHODE ISLAND - Democrat Claiborne Pell was elected to the Senate
in 1960, the year John F. Kennedy was elected president. He is
challenged by 43-year-old Rep. Claudine Schneider. Politely but
firmly, Schneider suggests it is time for a younger person to take
Pell's seat.
   NEW HAMPSHIRE - GOP Rep. Bob Smith was heavily favored to
capture the Senate seat being vacated by fellow conservative Gordon
Humphrey. But former Sen. John Durkin has made a race of it, and a
recent poll said Smith's 4-point lead was within the margin of
error.

<HEAD>Sheriff: Band Can Be Arrested Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.(AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sheriff who hauled members of 2
Live Crew into court on obscenity charges warned that despite their
acquittal, the rappers risk arrest again if they give another
concert in his bailiwick.
   A Broward County jury Saturday acquitted three members of the
group of obscenity over an adults-only performance June 10 at a
Hollywood nightclub.
   Luther Campbell, Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross and Chris ``Fresh
Kid Ice'' Wongwon could have received up to a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
   Sheriff Nick Navarro said Sunday he still considers songs from
the group's ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be'' album illegal, and he
warned band members against keeping their pledge to give another
concert in Broward County.
   ``If it is in Broward County, they will be arrested,'' Navarro
said.
   Navarro noted that a federal judge and another Broward County
jury had found the album obscene. ``Nothing has changed. Until
those decisions are reversed by a higher court, that is the law in
Broward County,'' he said.
   Jurors said their verdict was almost instantaneous.
   ``We found many of the things very humorous,'' said Beverly
Resnick, 65. ``Our feelings were, the musicians in the band were
telling the public how they felt inside of themselves, and they
were doing it with music. We thought it had some art in it.''
   Juror Helena Bailie, 76, a retired sociology professor, said the
band's performance despite threats of arrest may have been an act
of political defiance. ``Maybe the band felt threatened, and they
were thumbing their noses back,'' she said
   ``As the cross-section of the community that we are, it was just
not obscene,'' said foreman David Garsow, 24.
   The arrests came four days after a federal judge pronounced the
album obscene. The record includes references to oral and anal sex
and sexual violence against women.
   Earlier this month, record store owner Charles Freeman was
convicted of obscenity for selling ``Nasty.''
   Freeman, who is black, called Saturday's verdict ``true
justice'' and blamed his conviction on an all-white jury.
Saturday's jury had one black member. ``2 Live Crew had a
cross-section for a jury and I didn't,'' he said.
   The owner of the nightclub where the rap group played offered
the place to 2 Live Crew again, saying authorities should
concentrate on street crime and drugs. ``It's time to go on to
bigger and better things,'' said Ken Geringer, owner of Club
Futura.

   The slaying of a 10-year-old outside his
parents' year-old convenience store has dramatized the way
Columbus' growing prosperity has been accompanied by an increase in
violence.
   A bullet fired from a passing car two months ago shattered the
skull of Jasper Moffit Jr. as he stood outside the store on the
near east side.
   ``What really hurt us was that our son got shot dead in front of
us, and there was nothing we could do to help him,'' said his
mother, Cynthia Moffitt.
   The Moffitt business is an example of how the city's prosperity
has reached into some of its poorest neighborhoods. But the slaying
Aug. 25 points to a jump in violent crime that belies the state
capital's image as a sedate Midwestern city known more for big-time
college football than big-city crime.
   The violence comes at a time when national publications are
touting Columbus as a good place to do business.
   ``I think it is a combination of drugs and other things,'' said
police Sgt. Ralph Casto. ``It's just probably an unanswerable
question as far as being able to say specifically (what) the
increase of crime is caused by.''
   During just one recent weekend, a pipe bomb killed an 8-year-old
in his home, an 11-year-old girl was shot in the head while sitting
in a car at a restaurant, the body of a man in his early 20s was
dumped from a car, and a bullet pierced the abdomen of a woman who
was eight months' pregnant, killing the baby.
   The metropolitan area also has been hit by more than 100 bank
robberies since January. That's 24 more than last year and more
than all the bank robberies in metropolitan Cleveland and
Cincinnati combined.
   Law enforcement officials attribute the increase in bank
robberies to the large number of branches built to serve the city's
ballooning population.
   ``It's the way this city is growing, it's just exploding,'' said
Douglass C. Ogden, agent in charge of the FBI's Columbus office.
   Preliminary 1990 census figures indicate Columbus surpassed
Cleveland as Ohio's largest city, growing about 10 percent since
1980 to 622,500.
   In 1976, police counted 53 homicides, 328 rapes and 985
aggravated assaults. Last year, 89 homicides, 534 rapes and 1,898
aggravated assaults were recorded, although police say overall
crime decreased in 1989 for the first time since 1985.
   ``People used to talk about Cleveland being bad,'' said Annie
Kate Freeman, a Columbus resident since 1969. ``They used to give
Columbus praise, but they can't do it now because Columbus has
gotten really bad.''
   But national publications have praised Columbus.
   Fortune magazine this month ranked it among the top 10 locations
for business, citing the city's ``affordable housing and good
schools in an economically diverse city.''
   A World Trade magazine panel called Columbus one of the 10 best
second-tier cities for international companies, and the August
issue of Money magazine rated Columbus businesses as showing the
fourth-best stock performance among companies in the nation's 40
biggest cities.
   In August, The Wall Street Journal called Columbus ``one of the
few growing metropolitan areas in a slow-growth region.'' It said
the city ``has become a magnet for artists, actors, musicians and
bohemians.''

   Gus Somera, one of the ``Duncan Filipinos'' who
toured the world performing yo-yo tricks, has died at 82.
   Somera, whose real name was Sotero Parpana, died Thursday at the
West Side Veterans Administration Hospital.
   While the yo-yo's origin is uncertain, Don Duncan called the toy
a primitive Philippine weapon when he began marketing it in the
United States in 1929.
   To reinforce the myth, Duncan hired a group of Filipinos,
including Somera, to tour the country for his Duncan YoYo Co.
   ``He was a living legend. He was a magician not only in the use
of the toy, but also in how to work a crowd,'' said Duncan
spokesman Tom O'Brien.
   Somera served in the Army in World War II.
   He is survived by his wife, Felicitas.
   Services were scheduled for today.

   Neatness counts. Just ask Roland
``Duke'' Landry, the nation's oyster shucking champion.
   Competing in the U.S. National Oyster Shucking Championship on
Sunday, Landry, the defending champion, shucked two dozen oysters
in 2:03:52, a fraction behind Clementine Macon, who threw up her
hands in 2:02:80.
   But after the judges adjusted the competitors' times for
infractions such as a cut oyster or blood, dirt or grit on the half
shell, Landry finished at 2:59:52 and Macon at 3:31:80.
   ``I've got to give God the glory. I'm a born-again Christian,
and I've got to give him the glory,'' said Landry, 33, part-owner
of a Baton Rouge, La., restaurant.
   The shuckers had to pop open the oysters, discard the top shell,
cut the meat out of the bottom shell and place it neatly on the
half shell on a wooden tray as if they were serving at a raw bar.
   Longtime shucking contest observers said they had never seen
such a close competition.
   ``That was a horse race if I've ever seen one. It was oyster for
oyster and every second counted,'' said Cuthbert Fenwick of the
Lexington Park Rotary Club, which sponsors the competition.
   Landry and Macon faced off after winning the best male and
female shucker titles earlier Sunday. Both won $300 and a plaque.
The rotary club will pay for Landry's trip to Ireland for the world
championships next year.
   He finished sixth out of 11 competitors in the world
championships this year.
   The contest rules limit competitors to three national titles.
Landry has now won three times. ``I might come back next year to
watch,'' he said.
   It was Macon's first national women's title. A college student,
she honed her skills working in an oyster packing house.
   The contest is the highlight of the St. Mary's County Oyster
Festival. About 24,000 people attended the festivities Saturday and
Sunday.
   The competition drew competitors from Maryland, Washington,
Florida, South Carolina, New York, Connecticut and Texas.

<HEAD>Bypassed Combat Guard Unit Disappointed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield has lifted the spirits
of a U.S. military battered by budget cuts and the demise of the
Cold War, but one segment of the armed forces sees the Persian Gulf
buildup as a slap in the face.
   Combat units of the Army National Guard have been excluded from
the force deployments, which now total more than 200,000 personnel
in the gulf area, including more than 34,000 non-combat reserves
from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.
   ``We're trained and we're ready,'' said Beryl Diamond, a
spokesman for the Georgia Army National Guard, whose 48th Infantry
Brigade was left behind when the two active-duty brigades with
which it trains headed off for Saudi Arabia last month.
   ``It was disappointing to troops who had trained for a
mission,'' Diamond said.
   As in many of the other active divisions in the U.S. Army, the
48th serves as a ``roundout'' brigade for the 24th Mechanized
Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, Ga. But when the Pentagon
deployed the 24th to Saudi Arabia, it substituted an active brigade
- the 197th at Fort Benning, Ga. - instead of sending the 48th.
   The 155th Armored Brigade of the Mississippi Army National
Guard, which rounds out the 1st Cavalry Division from Fort Hood,
Texas, also was left cooling its heels when the division shipped
out for the Saudi desert this month. The Pentagon chose to fill out
the 1st Cavalry with an active brigade of the 2nd Armored Division.
   The controversy is growing now that the Pentagon is preparing to
rotate fresh troops into Saudi Arabia to replace those that have
been there from the start.
   No final decisions have been made, but the services are expected
to set Persian Gulf duty limits of six months. President Bush
ordered the gulf buildup on Aug. 8.
   That means the Pentagon again faces the question of whether to
use combat reserves, which are available under federal law for
six-month stints. The alternative would be to again deploy nnly
active units.
   The Pentagon's initial decision not to deploy the 48th and other
combat reserve units has raised fundamental questions about the
role of reserves in the U.S. armed forces.
   ``If we do not use the reserves when they are required, why have
a reserve?'' said Bill Legg, director of naval affairs at the
Reserve Officers Association, a private group.
   Since 1973, when the draft was abolished and the military
restructured itself, the armed forces have put increasing emphasis
on the role of reserves. But the gulf crisis is the first time the
``total force policy'' has been put to a test.
   Legg's group applauded the Bush administration when it
authorized the callup of as many as 48,800 non-combat reserves to
perform cargo handling, air transport, port security, intelligence
and various military supply jobs.
   But the Reserve Officers Association and others say that not
using combat reserves is a fierce blow to the morale of these
citizen soldiers who train with active units and are required by
law to be ready to mobilize in times of crisis.
   National Guard units train one weekend per month, plus one
four-week exercise each year.
   ``We've heard a number of reasons for not sending Guard and
reserve combat units but they're about as solid as sand,'' said
Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. ``I suspect the most important factor is the active
force prejudice against using reserve forces.''
   Aspin and Reps. Beverly Byron, D-Md., and Sonny Montgomery,
D-Miss., released a report last week sharply criticizing the Bush
administration for not using combat reserve units in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The suggestion, intended or not, that their work is neither
fully appreciated or really needed in time of hostilities would
have a disastrous influence on morale and performance,'' the report
said. ``The failure to make greater use of reserve units in this
crisis raises the broader question of when - and even whether -
they would be used in the future.''
   Pentagon officials cite two reasons for not sending combat
reserves to Saudi Arabia. One is that field commanders in Saudi
Arabia have not said they need them. The other is that the 180-day
maximum deployment period for reserves is too short to make good
use of combat units since they would need extra training before
shipping out.
   Critics say the reserves should not need extra training. They
cite the Pentagon's own study of the reserve forces, published last
spring, stating that ``the reserve components have achieved
unprecedented levels of capability and readiness.''
   The Georgia Army National Guard's Diamond scoffed at the
suggestion that the 48th would need extra time to get ready.
   ``We believe the 48th brigade would require no more training
than an active brigade would,'' he said.

   If the Agriculture Department is truly
interested in saving money, it could consider eliminating some of
the scores of studies that high-salaried economists and policy
analysts spew forth each year.
   But Congress has called the tune until now, leaving USDA no
choice but to study such things as gypsy moths, brucellosis, flower
sales and composting.
   This could change under the 1990 farm bill approved last week by
conferees from the House and Senate.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., was fed up with all the expensive studies
the USDA was ordered to perform and conferees approved his
amendment to cut back on some of the load.
   ``Many of these studies are duplicative and unnecessary, and
very likely will never even be read or used to shape future policy
decisions,'' Dole said. ``This provision removes some of the
nonsense which an election year has put into the farm bill.''
   Dole said his plan could potentially save up to $100 million by
limiting the studies. ``Let's save some money for a change and stop
this silly study craze,'' he said.
   Under his plan, the USDA would choose a minimum of 12 studies to
be carried out as part of the five-year farm bill. The selection
would also have to gain the approval of Senate and House
agriculture committee chairmen.
   According to Dole's office, the massive farm bill calls for 168
studies, reports and surveys.
   The significance of the Dole amendment is that USDA would be
able to pick and choose those subjects for study, with committee
approval. Previously, it was mandatory for USDA to study whatever
was specified.
   Many of the studies over the years have been self-serving
instruments for farm commodity groups, agricultural industries and
individual members of Congress. Studies are sometimes an easy way
to impress the home folk and to delay or affect legislative action.
   In short, some of the USDA studies can be pretty dear to the
hearts of certain lawmakers.
   For example, when Senate members of the farm bill conference
committee tried to eliminate a study on roses and other flowers,
the House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
jumped to its defense.
   The study on the effects of imported flowers on the domestic cut
flower industry meant a lot to the House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, said de la Garza.
   Flower-growing is an important industry in Panetta's northern
California district.
   ``I don't want to make a big issue of this,'' said Sen. Richard
Lugar, of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the committee. ``But
our research shows that in 10 of the last 13 years there has been a
cut-flower (study) program'' by the government, including the U.S.
International Trade Commission.
   De la Garza insisted another study was necessary. The Senate
side of the conference table surrendered.
   More than 200 studies were listed in the House and Senate farm
bills. Some duplication appeared to exist even within single
portions.
   In the Senate bill, for example, the title on trade specified
four separate studies or reports on: export assistance update; the
trade assistance office; export sales, use of credit guarantees and
direct loans; and food aid assistance.
   The bill's portion about conservation sought a ``study of
compost uses and processes for composting agricultural wastes.'' It
also asked for studies on ``outreach to socially disadvantaged
farmers'' and ``consolidation of USDA offices on Indian
reservations.''
   Finally, at the end of the conservation title, the Senate bill
specified compilation of a ``catalog of laws, rules and programs
regarding composts.''
   In the research part of the bill, a study was sought on ``farm
accident prevention'' and also a ``tractor rollover study.''
   Global warming was a biggie for Senate farm bill writers, with
three USDA studies outlined on:
   -Agriculture and forestry implications of global change.
   -Effects of global warming on rice production.
   -Experimental studies on the effects of global warming on the
production of major U.S. crops.
   The House version of the farm bill included a heavy
concentration on food aid to foreign countries, including one on
World Food Day.
   Others included a report on ``wood and fish export promotion,''
which was listed next to Chairman de la Garza's favored study on
cut flowers, followed by a ``commodity transportation and
technology assessment'' report and a ``red tart cherry'' study.

   Lebanon's political mob war has spared no
one.
   Leaders from all major Moslem and Chrisiian groups in the bloody
15-year power struggle have been assassinated by bullets or bombs.
   The latest victim, Christian leader Dany Chamoun, was killed
Sunday when five gunmen burst into his Beirut apartment. The five
uniformed gunmen, who used silencer-equipped pistols, also murdered
his wife and two small sons.
   The slayings were branded by Christian and Moslem leaders alike
as an attempt to block a plan to end the civil war, which has
primarily pitted Moslems against Christians.
   Chamoun, a Maronite Catholic and the son of late President
Camille Chamoun, was one of the most outspoken critics of President
Elias Hrawi and Syria's military presence in Lebanon.
   He also was at odds with Christian warlord Samir Geagea, whose
Lebanese Forces militia fought a four-month war with Gen. Michel
Aoun's troops early this year for mastery of the Christian
hinterland.
   Chamoun was a top supporter of Aoun, who took refuge in the
French Embassy a week ago after being routed by government and
Syrian troups. France has granted him asylum, but the government
insists he stay and stand trial for alleged crimes.
   Chamoun's father, Camille, died a natural death in August 1987.
But in 1980 and 1987, he narrowly escaped assassination when
remote-controlled bombs exploded near his car, wounding him both
times.
   On June 13, 1978, Christian militiamen loyal to Bashir Gemayel
murdered Tony Franjieh, son and political heir of Suleiman
Franjieh, president of Lebanon from 1970 to 1976.
   Franjieh's wife and three-year-old daughter were also killed.
   Gemayel later admitted that his men were involved - but said
they had no authorization to kill Franjieh, who led a rival
militia.
   Four years later, Gemayel was slain at age 34. Three weeks after
being elected president on Aug. 23, 1982, he was killed in an
explosion at the headquarters of his Phalange Party, the leading
Maronite Christian political grouping.
   Rene Mouawad, head of an important Christian clan in northeast
Lebanon, did not even last as long as Gemayel as president.
   On Nov. 22, 1989, just 17 days after his election, a
remote-control bomb killed Mouawad. He was succeeded by Hrawi, who
is seeking to implement an Arab League-brokered peace plan.
   The most important surviving Christian militia leader, Geagea,
has survived several assassination attempts.
   Moslem factions have also seen their top chiefs murdered.
   Prime Minister Rashid Karami, the most prominent Sunni Moslem
leader in Lebanon, was killed June 1, 1987, when a bomb exploded
aboard an army helicopter in which he was a passenger.
   The current prime minister, Salim Hoss, has tasted the threat of
assassination.
   Hoss, a prominent Sunni Moslem leader, was education minister in
1984 when a bomb exploded as he drove to a mosque, wounding him
with glass and shrapnel.
   Lebanon's largest religious group, the Shiite Moslems, lost
their leader Musa Sadr. He disappeared in 1978 while on a trip to
Libya, whose leader Moammar Gadhafi has backed the Sunnis. Sadr is
presumed to have been murdered.
   Kamal Jumblatt, a prominent left-wing political leader and chief
of Lebanon's Druse sect, which fields one of the toughest militias,
was machine-gunned to death at a road ambush in March 1977.
   His son and successor, Walid Jumblatt, survives uneasily. In
June 1987, he asked an aide to open a gift that appeared to be a
case containing a pen. It exploded, blowing the aide's hands off.
   Prominent foreigners have also fallen in the spate of
assassinations.
   In June 1976, kidnappers took U.S. Ambassador Francis E. Meloy
and his economic counselor, Robert O. Waring, from their limousine.
Their bullet-riddled bodies were recovered later at a beach in
Moslem west Beirut.
   Four French Embassy staffers have been killed since 1981,
including Ambassador Louis Delamar when three gunmen fired on him
on Sept. 4, 1981, just outside his home.
   Malcolm Kerr, president of American University of Beirut, was
shot to death in a hallway outside his office in January 1984.
   On Oct. 23, 1983, a suicide truck-bomber blew up the
headquarters of the French contingent of the multinational
peacekeeping force in Beirut, killing 58 French soldiers.
   A similar bombing was carried out at the same time against the
force's U.S. Marine contingent, killing 241 Americans. The bombings
were claimed by the pro-Iranian Shiite extremist group called
Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War.
   An estimated 150,000 people have died in Lebanon's civil war.

<HEAD>Iraqi Troops May Be Regrouping North</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi troops are continually repositioning
themselves inside Kuwait, making it ``entirely possible'' that a
large number of forces have regrouped in the north, according to
Pentagon and private analysts.
   Lt. Col. Steve Roy, a Pentagon spokesman, said Sunday he could
not confirm a report from the Persian Gulf that Iraqi forces have
begun pulling back to the northern part of the country.
   But he said the report was ``entirely possible'' because of
constant Iraqi troop movements in Kuwait, the oil-rich country Iraq
invaded on Aug. 2. U.S. officials estimate Iraq has up to 400,000
troops in or around Kuwait.
   Al-Khaleej, a newspaper in Sharjah, one of the United Arab
Emirates, reported Sunday that hundreds of tanks and armored
vehicles and armored personnel carriers have been sighted heading
toward north Kuwait, specifically to the region of Matla.
   The paper gave no source for its report, and independent
verification could not be obtained because journalists have been
unable to enter Kuwait recently.
   The Iraqi forces were grouping around a fence in the occupied
country, the paper said. Last week, Kuwaiti refugees said Iraqis
were building a fence in the region of Matla, surrounding the
islands of Warba and Bubiyan and the Rumailah oil field. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein claimed these regions before Aug. 2.
   Marshall Wiley, a former ambassador to Iraq now in private
business, said Saddam might be inclined to increase protection of
the oil field and the islands if he believed the United States was
prepared to launch offensive action.
   James Akins, a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia an now a
private consultant, said the Bush administration's ``worst
nightmare'' would be for Saddam to withdraw from most of Kuwait,
clinging only to the huge oil field and the islands. Saddam has
long sought the islands because they give Iraq access to the sea.
   Such a scenario would force the administration to justify
keeping 200,000 troops in Saudi Arabia even though Saddam had left
most of Kuwait, Akins said.
   The Bush administration and the United Nations have insisted
that Iraq withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait and returning
control of its government to the al-Sabah family now in exile.
   There have been conflicting interpretations of what Saddam
intends to do in Kuwait, a country his troops have systematically
looted over the past 2{ months.
   CIA Director William Webster said in an interview with The
Associated Press last week that ``everything suggests he is there
for the long haul.'' Webster said Saddam's troops are ``dug in.''
   Another intelligence analyst, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Saddam's fall-back position might be to relinquish
all of Kuwait except the islands and the oil field.
   Last week, a London-based Iraqi opposition group said Iraq was
considering withdrawing from Kuwait. The Kurdistan Democratic
Party-Iraq said Iraq's ruling political party had circulated a
questionnaire asking key members for their opinion on the issue.
   In other developments Sunday:
   - Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, insisted that
only Congress has the right to declare war. Mitchell reiterated a
position that has put Congress at odds with top Bush administration
officials. ``Only Congress can make that grave decision,'' Mitchell
said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press'' program.
   Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III refused to
commit the administration to getting any advance congressional
approval for any military action.
   - The Middle East Policy Survey, a newsletter published in
Washington, reported that a few days before Saddam invaded Kuwait,
Bush sent a message to the Iraqi president. The message, relayed to
the Iraqi foreign minister, expressed the administration's concern
about Iraqi troop movements, but said the United States wanted
improved U.S.-Iraqi relations.
   The Washington Post in Sunday's editions quoted sources as
confirming that Bush wrote a presidential message which was
supposed to be relayed to Saddam through April Glaspie, the U.S.
ambassador to Iraq.

   Josie Heath was showered with national attention
when she became the only woman in the country to launch a serious
Democratic bid for the U.S. Senate this year.
   The former Boulder County commissioner attracted support from
women's groups with her pro-choice abortion stance and she captured
the Democratic nomination in August after a tough primary election
campaign against attorney Carlos Lucero.
   Then she ran up against Republican Rep. Hank Brown.
   Brown, who has been in Congress 10 years, holds a comfortable
lead in the pols and is gaining ground. His well-financed campaign
emphasizes the congressman's independent streak.
   For example, Brown has been a diehard opponent of new taxes. And
he has a more moderate record than the current holder of the seat,
GOP Sen. Bill Armstrong, on issues such as abortion and the
environment.
   Brown never has been a Republican Party ``goose-stepper,'' says
press aide Katy Atkinson. ``He's voted against Ronald Reagan, and
he's voted against Bush - even though Bush has been out here twice
to raise money for him.''
   The fact that Brown is an incumbent is not a drawback in
Colorado.
   ``Simply to be a part of the news flow that comes out of the
nation's capitol, at this point, is not a disadvantage,'' said Rick
Ridder, a political consultant to Democratic candidates. ``We've
not seen any anti-incumbency movement in Colorado, unlike
Massachusetts.''
   Brown ``is so popular right now I think people just aren't going
to change - no matter what the television ads say,'' says longtime
lobbyist Stan Sours of Denver.
   During the primary campaign, Heath, 53, proposed converting the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant to a toxic waste research
facility. She also favored some form of national health care.
   But in the race against Brown, she has spent much of her time
attacking her opponent, characterizing him as an advocate for
polluters and a friend of savings and loan wheeler-dealers.
   Lately she has toned down that approach. But she has failed to
establish who she is and what she stands for.
   ``You cannot launch an attack on someone without establishing
your own base - it's fundamental,'' said longtime Democratic
consultant Jim Monaghan.
   Aside from her reputation as a hard-working Boulder County
commissioner, she has no established political credentials.
   ``It's clear that voters do not yet know who Josie is,''
acknowledges Heath coordinator Bobby McCallum.
   Brown was leading Heath 57 percent to 29 percent in the latest
poll. His lead went up 8 percentage points in two weeks. He also is
way ahead in campaign finances, collecting more than $2.5 million
in donations to Heath's $1.25 million.
   McCallum predicts a major shift in support when Heath's campaign
airs new television ads, claiming that only 36 percent of Brown's
support is solid. And Heath's camp has enough money to make ``a
decent buy'' on the airwaves, he says.
   Some feel Heath may have turned some Democrats off during her
vitriolic clashes with Lucero before the August primary.
   ``In Colorado, if they (the voters) don't know you, they don't
really like to see you come out blasting someone they do know,''
said one political advisor, who asked not to be identified because
she is working for a Republican candidate.
   Heath's views on defense also don't play well with many of
Colorado's conservative Democrats.
   Early in the primary campaign, she proposed cutting the defense
budget by half over 10 years. That backfired after the primary when
political cartoonists juxtaposed her stand on defense with
depictions of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.
   In addition, Heath is emphasizing her opposition to the line
item veto and a proposed balanced budget amendment when more and
more of the state's Democrats are embracing those ideas.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Students Risked Another Tiananmen, And Won</HEAD>

   More than 200 went on hunger strike. Six
were hospitalized. But in the end, the students who created a
bloodless version of Tiananmen Square in the Ukraine were sad to go
home.
   For 16 days this month, the pro-independence hunger strikers
lived in a tent city on the main square of Kiev, the Ukrainian
capital, deliberately duplicating the tactics of pro-democracy
Chinese students in Beijing in 1989.
   The Ukrainian students gambled that Soviet authorities would not
dare to follow China's example and send the army to crush them.
   They turned out to be right.
   ``We went in with cold minds, prepared for any kind of conflict,
but with the conviction that the only real path open to the
government was peaceful,'' said Vladimir Boyarsky, a 22-year-old
medical student.
   On Wednesday, the Ukrainian government capitulated to most of
the students' demands for faster steps toward independence,
including the resignation of the republic's prime minister.
   On Thursday, they took down the tents they had staked between
cracks in the marble slabs of Revolution Square.
   And over the weekend, they headed back to their homes across
this fertile republic of 51 million people, the breadbasket of the
Soviet Union.
   ``After the government announced it was giving in, we went wild
with joy,'' Boyarsky said Friday.
   ``Then we all realized that this piece of our lives was ending,
we would be heading off in different directions, and hardly anyone
slept that night with all the sentimental goodbyes.''
   That sentiment was far removed from the tension the students
felt on the first day of the hunger strike, Oct. 2, when seven
busloads of riot police pulled up to the square.
   The strike had been planned for weeks, in extreme detail, by the
Ukrainian Student Union in Kiev and the Student Brotherhood in
Lvov, a city of 770,000 in the Western Ukraine.
   Both groups were angry over the lack of progress toward
independence by the republic's parliament since it declared
sovereignty July 16. They demanded bolder moves, such as those
taken by the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   ``Every nation has a right to self-determination on its own
territory,'' law student Igor Osobik, 22, said Friday.
   ``You know, more than 40 million Ukrainians have been killed in
the period of Soviet power, from famine and from bullets. Why can't
we be masters of our own fate, our own future, our own land?''
   On Oct. 2, a day after the Ukrainian parliament opened its
session, 120 hunger strikers and 50 supporters set up the first 22
tents on Revolution Square, under a towering bronze statue of
Lenin.
   Supporters wore armbands to mark their pre-assigned roles: red
for medics; black for guards keeping order in the camp; blue for
people serving tea and cleaning up.
   They had a permit for a demonstration, but not for the tents.
While fearing a police raid at any minute, they concentrated on
explaining their position to passers-by.
   The students accused the parliamentary majority, a bloc of 239
Communist Party members, of ``toadying to Moscow.''
   They argued that the Communists and the republic's prime
minister, Vitaly Masol, were trying to thwart real independence by
moving toward a new union treaty with other Soviet republics at the
urging of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   They vowed to remain on the square until the parliament agreed
to six demands: Masol's resignation; rejection of any new union
treaty; permission for all Ukrainians in the Soviet army to serve
on Ukrainian soil; nationalization of Communist Party property in
the Ukraine; dissolution of parliament; and new elections.
   ``The first day there was a very heavy feeling, because we
didn't know what the police were going to do,'' said Boyarsky.
``But all they did was surround us, and the next day, we began what
you might call normal life.''
   History student Lyudmila Demirskaya, 25, said most of the
students spent their days singing folk songs and meeting new
arrivals, who came at the rate of more than 50 a day from schools
across the republic, swelling the camp to more than 800 people.
   A total of 217 students registered as hunger strikers for
varying lengths of time. About 20 reportedly went without food for
a full two weeks.
   Christopher Kedzie, a Harvard University researcher working on
economic reform in the Ukraine, said he walked by the tent city
every day and was ``amazed at two things: the discipline of the
students and the outpouring of support'' from Kiev residents, who
brought mattresses, blankets, money and flowers.
   Thousands of people marched through the city last Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesdaty to support the students' demands. Students
claim the largest march, on the 17th, involved more than 100,000
people; authorities say it was only 20,000.
   Whatever the figure, public support for the students was strong
enough that parliament realized ``we had to take them seriously,
and the only rational course was compromise,'' said Alexander
Kotzuba, a centrist lawmaker.
   On Wednesday evening, Masol agreed to resign, and parliament
passed a resolution promising to put off signing a new union treaty
and saying all Ukrainian soldiers should be allowed to serve inside
the republic.
   It also set up a commission to work on nationalizing Communist
Party property and called for a referendum to decide whether to
dissolve parliament and hold new elections.
   ``Last week, we felt the strength of our youth,'' Sergei Sukhov,
a 62-year-old printer, said on a Kiev streetcorner. ``Not all of us
were at the demonstrations, but we supported, they won, and they
are now the pride of our nation.''

   Retiring from Congress this year must feel
like stepping off a runaway train: Relief mixed with concern - and
no regrets.
   ``One of my burdens is being teased by my colleagues for having
such incredible timing,'' laughs Rep. Bob Whittaker, R-Kan. ``I'm
glad I'm going to do it now.''
   The budget mess, government shutdown, ethics scandals and the
pay raise have made this latest Congress even more hateable than
usual. But if the historical pattern holds, and it may not, there
will be few House incumbents sent packing by the voters on Nov. 6.
   There are a handful packing their own bags for home. Eleven out
of 434 House members are retiring - not defeated, just leaving.
   Conversations with most of them reveal some bitterness, a
longing for happier times and a wish they were retiring from a
Congress with higher public esteem.
   ``It takes you out with a bad taste in your mouth,'' the way the
101st Congress has performed, said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., who
labored mightily to find a bipartisan budget only to have the House
shoot it down. ``It's no fun to be part of a group that can't get
its work done.''
   Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., ran for governor last year. He could
have kept his House seat, but decided against seeking another term.
He feels he's been proven right.
   People who questioned ``the rightness and correctness of my
decision'' are now coming up and saying, ``I don't blame you,'' he
said.
   Courter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said
things had changed for the worse over the 12 years he's spent in
the House. He related how he was barred from recent House-Senate
talks on the defense budget, and then was threatened if he didn't
sign the agreement.
   ``They told me, `You've put some language in there (the bill).
It's going to come out unless you sign it,''' he said. He didn't
sign.
   ``It's a heck of a way to go out,'' he sighed, looking forward
to what he said would be ``a more simple life.''
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., saw her husband Hale give his life to
the House. She now is retiring from the seat he once held.
   The current gloom ``gives me particular pain because I spent so
many years in the institution.'' But she takes solace in the work
she did on marking Congress' bicentennial.
   ``When this temporary difficulty is passed, (that) will be there
to sustain the institution ... the People's Body,'' she said.
   Whittaker, who'll be teaching political science at the
University of Kansas, said he wasn't worried about Congress. He
said there have been other periods when the legislative branch was
held in low regard.
   ``From a historical perspective, it's something that goes
around,'' he said.
   Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, says he hopes people will see
something positive in his retirement from an influential
congressional career at age 59.
   ``People say nobody walks away from that job. Well, somebody
did. And maybe that gives a little bit of faith to people who think
the system is so totally corrupt and bad. It really isn't,'' Leath
said.
   Rep. Virginia Smith, R-Neb., though saddened by the current
uproar, remains sentimental about the place.
   ``It's been 16 great years,'' she said, recalling how she ``had
to win over nine handsome young men just to come to Congress'' at a
time when women were still considered unusual in politics.
   ``I'm going to miss these folks,'' she said, but ``we want to

home.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., is a powerful committee
chairman who looks forward to returning to private life after 28
years - and complaining about Congress.
   ``It's good. I'm glad to see it,'' he said of the national
discontent. ``And I'll be one of those outsiders attacking.''

<HEAD>Four Policemen Killed by Sikh Land Mine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMRITSAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sikh extremists lured a government patrol
down a lonely road early today and exploded a land mine that killed
four policemen and wounded 10, a police official said.
   Three police jeeps were dispatched to Vadalakan after Sikh
gunmen fired on a police post at the village, according to Parmjit
Singh, senior superintendent of police of the surrounding Majitha
district.
   When the patrol approached the village 25 miles east of
Amritsar, a land mine exploded between the first two jeeps, he
said.
   No one was injured by the gunfire directed at the police post,
Singh said. Similar attacks have been staged often in Punjab in
order to ambush policemen rushing to the assistance of colleagues.
   Sikh militants fighting to create an independent nation in
Punjab state have killed at least 2,430 people so far this year,
making 1990 certain to be the extremists' deadliest year since
their separatist revolt started in 1983.
   The worst previous year was 1988 when about 2,440 people were
killed by the militants in Punjab, a prosperous farming state
northwest of New Delhi.
   The Sikh militants accuse India's Hindu-dominated government of
economic and political discrimination.
   Sikhs hold a slight majority over Hindus in Punjab, but
nationwide they make up only 2 percent of India's 880 million
people. Hindus have a national majority of 82 percent.

<TEXT>
   Kevin Hermening is still searching for the
right start to his political career a decade after his release as
an Iranian hostage. He is fighting his past as much as his
political rival.
   The former hostage label is a political noose to him.
   ``It is the single major liability to my running for office,''
said Hermening. The 31-year-old Republican is running for the
Wisconsin Assembly after two failed bids for Congress.
   ``The people of the community are sick and tired of it,''
Hermening said of his hostage past. ``The biggest difficulty is
most people think the only thing I have done has been in Iran.''
   Hermening, a former Marine guard, was the youngest of the 52
people held hostage for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Iran in
1979.
   Since returning to Wisconsin, he has worked for a political
consulting firm and run twice unsuccessfully for Congress, losing
in 1986 and 1988 to Democratic Rep. David Obey.
   Hermening scaled back his political ambitions in June,
announcing he would challenge state Rep. Brad Zweck, a two-term
Democrat. He is running in a north-central Wisconsin district that
has elected five different legislators in the past 12 years.
   Running for the legislature is a ``relief actually,'' not a
letdown, Hermening said.
   ``Running for Congress in the `80s and `90s is like trying to
scale a mountain with none of the gear,'' Hermening said. ``Unless
you are a self-made millionaire, you simply don't have a chance.''
   A year ago, on the 10-year anniversary of the seizure of the
embassy in Iran, Hermening said the experience drove everything he
did.
   Today, he tries to distance himself. Politics dictates such a
strategy, he says.
   Hermening has received letters from people praising him for his
courage. But letters accusing him of cowardice come too: ``Kevin
Hermening and other Marines surrendered the fort. They gave up the
ship,'' one letter said.
   Hermening has sent out about 75 campaign news releases over the
past five years, none of which mentioned Iran or the hostages.
   He's asked newspapers editors not to refer to him as a former
Iranian hostage - at least not in the first three words of their
stories.
   ``My campaign brochure doesn't have a picture of me with a
Marine uniform,'' Hermening said.
   Zweck says Hermening's celebrity status is a ``two-edged
sword.''
   People have a very strong first impression of him, ``one way or
the other,'' the incumbent said.
   But Zweck isn't so sure voters question Hermening only about his
role in the Iranian hostage crisis. Some wonder if he is a
carpetbagger who moved from his native Milwaukee to northern
Wisconsin only to run for Congress, Zweck said.
   ``They resent he abused that status and moved into a strange
area and immediately ran for office,'' Zweck said.
   Hermening's well-publicized involvement in protests against
Indian hunting and fishing rights in northern Wisconsin also
irritates some voters, Zweck added.
   ``Those are types of activities that make you a great person in
the eyes of some but a very negative figure in the eyes of
others,'' the lawmaker said.
   Hermening, a self-described conservative, said he's always been
interested in public service. He's owned a home in the district for
3{ years.
   ``Tell me what Brad Zweck ever did to better qualify him for
running for office compared to what I did,'' he asks.
   While Hermening shuns the ``former hostage'' label in public, he
maintains personal pride in the ordeal he survived. And he feels a
special concern for those now held hostage in Iraq.
   ``I have got my medals displayed prominently. I have a flag
outside my house. You're damn right I am proud of it,'' Hermening
said. ``I have a big yellow ribbon outside my house. Millions of
people put them up for me. The least I can do is put one up for
them.''

<HEAD>House Votes Limits on Mailing Privileges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stung by public criticism, the House is moving
to force its members to tell the public how much postage-free mail
they send and rein in those lawmakers who abuse the privilege.
   New limits on how much mail House members can send out free were
made part of a $2.2 billion bill that provides money to operate
Congress in the 1991 fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The bill was
approved 292-117 Sunday and sent to the Senate.
   The bipartisan compromise limit on Congress' franking privilege,
adopted on a voice vote, was a sign that lawmakers are nervous
about their low standing in the public eye.
   With that in mind, and with elections just 16 days away, the
House also voted $76 million in spending cuts before giving final
approval to the appropriations bill. Included in the cuts was a
proposed $50,000-per-member increase in staff salary accounts.
   Members were so sensitive about spending money on themselves
that they hours Sunday sparring over whether to spend $500,000 on
modular furniture and $350,000 to renovate the House beauty shop.
   The furniture was nixed, but the beauty shop renovation was
preserved after female House members argued that its old wiring
represents a safety hazard.
   Despite appearances, the ceilings on free mail were set high
enough to avoid affecting most lawmakers. And some of the other
cuts are expected to be restored in negotiations with the Senate
this week or in a supplemental money bill next year, staff sources
said.
   Left unscathed was a whopping increase in House members'
salaries - from their current $96,600 to $125,100 effective Jan. 1.
   Under the new mail limits, each House member would be given an
allowance sufficient to send three first-class mailings to each
residential address in the district, an average of $178,000.
   Members could boost that another $25,000 by transferring money
from their office accounts, and each would have to report quarterly
on how much had been spent. Total mailing costs would be limited to
$59 million in the year that began Oct. 1.
   The move was designed to prevent abuses by a few members who
spend upwards of $400,000 a year on mail, including the ubiquitous
newsletters designed primarily to get a lawmaker's name and picture
into thousands of homes.
   It is those mailings that reformers point to as a primary
benefit that enabled 98 percent of the incumbent House members to
hold on to their job last election.
   Mass mailings were used as ``a public relations menu for some
members of the House,'' said Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., who argued
in favor of the change along with Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.
   The Senate already restricts and reveals the mail costs of its
members, but House leaders until recently resisted the idea.
   Two congressional watchdog groups, Common Cause and the National
Taxpayers Union, had endorsed the restrictions on the franking
privilege.

   A teen-ager posing as a hanging victim
along the route of a Halloween hayride was found hanged for real,
authorities said.
   Brian Jewell, 17, of Toms River was found dead Saturday night by
the driver of the hayride.
   Police spokesman Lt. Howard Patterson said the death appeared to
be accidental.
   The rope was a prop only and never should have gone around the
boy's neck, said Lt. Michael Murray, spokesman for the Ocean County
prosecutor's office.
   A group of hayriders had approached the hanging scene, but
Jewell never gave them his haunting pitch, Murray said. It was then
that the driver checked on the boy.
   The ride, featuring costumed performers, was run by Ocean
Haunted Hayrides Inc., for whom, Jewell, a high school student, was
working. A employee who refused to give his name said the ride's
operators had no comment.

<HEAD>Dollar Still Edging Up, Stocks Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar continued edging up today from its
13-day slide against the Japanese yen, and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's key index rose above 25,000 points for the first time
since Sept. 13.
   The dollar closed at 126.25, up 1.00 yen from Friday's close of
125.25 yen. It opened at 125.68 yen and ranged as high as 126.40
yen.
   The dollar had fallen 13.55 yen in 13 trading days before
gaining 0.85 yen on Friday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average
rose for the sixth consecutive trading day, closing at 25,070.86,
up 589.37 points, or 2.1 percent, from Friday's close.
   The index gained a total of 2,091.33 points last week.
   In dollar trading, traders said some market players have been
expecting a correction after the U.S. currency's rapid decline. But
most, they add, look for the dollar to fall later this year near
its postwar low of 120.45 yen, reach on Jan. 4, 1988.
   ``There is a tug-of-war between the two sides,'' said Jumpei
Ishii of Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Katsumi Asako, chief corporate dealer with Standard Chartered
Bank in Tokyo, said, ``I don't think the dollar can climb as high
as 130 yen.''
   ``Over the medium term, most people are still bearish toward the
dollar. But for the next one or two weeks, the market should be
nervous and won't have enough momentum to push the dollar down
further,'' said Masafumi Iwamoto, assistant general foreign
exchange
manager with Mitsui Trust and Banking.
   Meanwhile, ``the stock market continues to be vigorous,
following last week's five-day rallying stretch,'' said a dealer at
Wako Securities Co., who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Reports about a possible peaceful resolution of the Middle East
crisis added to the market's optimistic mood, he said. Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein expressed interest in a negotiated settlement in a
Japanese television interview.
   Peace in the Persian Gulf is expected to mean cheaper oil prices
for Japan, which depends on the Middle East for about 70 percent of
its oil. Japan has been plagued by inflation fears and plummeting
stock prices since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The market now is recovering from a two-year Nikkei index low of
20,221.86 points on Oct. 1.
   Trading volume also has recovered. Estimated volume for the
first section Monday was 600 million shares. Volume last Friday was
1.1 billion shares, the highest this year.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds rose
to 84.75 points today from their close of 84.66 on Friday. Their
yield dropped to 7.750 percent from 7.770 percent.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Forest Service Workers Join Group Critical of Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEQUIM, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the Olympic Peninsula, where logging is
revered and spotted owls are hung in effigy, Jeff DeBonis preaches
a message that many folks don't want to hear: the Forest Service
has been raping the land for decades to feed a ``profit-hungry''
timber industry.
   It's a message that the founder of the Association of Forest
Service Employees for Environmental Ethics repeats often - to
generally polite audiences.
   However, he acknowledges he has his work cut out for him in a
region where the conservation vs. jobs debate tends to be stated in
stark terms.
   ``There is a real cultural bias that has been perpetuated - the
tree-hugging, environmental hippy on food stamps versus the
good-ol'-boy, red neck, pickup-truck-driving logger,'' DeBonis said
recently before making an appearance at the Highway 101 diner.
   ``If they consider me to be the enemy, then that's fine. The
Forest Service has been considering the public the enemy for
years,'' he said in an interview.
   DeBonis, of Eugene, Ore., resigned his job in February after 12
years as a timber sales manager with the Forest Service. He said
most of the 1,500 Forest Service workers who have joined his group
are foresters who went to college in the 1960s and 1970s ``and got
a dose of ecology and social conscience.''
   ``They have seen the destruction but they are not in a position
of power yet to do anything about it,'' he said.
   AFSEEE advocates dramatic reductions in timber harvests to help
protect the Northwest's dwindling supply of old-growth forests. The
group contends that the Forest Service has been overcutting trees
in violation of the 1976 National Forest Management Act.
   DeBonis said those practices have resulted in the northern
spotted owl becoming a threatened species and the red cockaded
woodpecker becoming endangered.
   DeBonis' fear of a hostile audience in Sequim proved to be
largely unfounded. But one critic in the crowd of 75 did shout,
``You're wrong,'' and a local Forest Service employee charged that
DeBonis' organization was ``a front for preservationists ... a
special interest the same as the timber industry.''
   ``It seems to me that you're saying if I am not a member, then I
am not for the environment,'' said Harvey Olson, a Forest Service
timber sale administrator.
   ``There are a lot of people in the Forest Service with guts and
real concerns. You don't have a license on that,'' Olson said.
   Since he launched AFSEEE nearly two years ago, DeBonis said its
membership has grown to include about 5 percent of the agency's
workforce nationwide.
   More importantly, he said, an increasing number of those
disgruntled workers are going public with their complaints.
   ``There are lots of people who are still afraid to join AFSEEE.
It's a very valid fear because the Forest Service is decentralized
and there are lots of old-school managers out there. It is very
easy for them to make people's lives miserable,'' DeBonis said.
   ``But the lower echelon people are starting to say enough is
enough. I know of a lot of people in the past who would just quit
in disgust,'' he said.
   DeBonis' appearance was sponsored by the Quilcene Ancient Forest
Coalition.
   Bob Crowley, head of the coalition and the Olympic Environmental
Council, said interest in AFSEEE became visible on the peninsula
among 30 to 35 Forest Service workers about a year ago ``but it was
pretty clandestine.''
   John Calhoun, Olympic regional manager for the state Department
of Natural Resources in Forks, said the debate over timber
management practices has sharply divided the Forest Service.
   ``The Forest Service internally is just in a shambles right now.
There is a lot of difficultly with morale,'' Calhoun said.
   DeBonis said he is sympathetic to concerns of lost jobs as a
result of reductions in logging. But he said at the current rate of
cutting, the jobs will be lost in 10 years anyway, regardless of
the spotted owl or other environmental issues.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
governing coalition retained power in weekend elections, winning
more than the two-thirds parliamentary majority it had sought,
election officials said today.
   The National Front coalition won 127 seats in the lower house to
49 for the combined opposition. Four seats went to independents.
   Elections Commission officials said the final results were
delayed until this afternoon because heavy rains prevented some
ballot boxes from remote aborigine settlements from being airlifted
when the polls closed Sunday.
   After singing a victory song and cutting a cake, a jubilant
Mahathir said, ``We are happy that the people have returned us to
power with a more than two-thirds majority. This will enable us to
give a strong, peaceful and stable government.''
   It was his third election victory since becoming prime minister
in 1981. He claims credit for one of the fastest growing economies
in Southeast Asia.
   But the governing coalition suffered to upsets: Defense Minister
Ahmed Rithaudden was defeated in the Kelantan state district of
Kota Baharu, and Stephen Young, minister for science, technology
and environment, lost in Sarawak.
   Anything less than a two-thirds majority in Parliament would
have been regarded as a setback for Mahathir. Such a margin is
needed to amend the constitution and it also is a gauge of the
prime minister's power.
   In the old Parliament, the coalition held 133 of the 177 seats.
The new one was enlarged by three seats.
   Opposition leader Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah won re-election to his
Parliament seat.
   He issued a statement congratulating the governing coalition on
its victory. But, he added: ``I wish to remind that this victory
has been achieved through abuse of power, money, the mass media,
government machinery and every deceit possible.''
   He did not elaborate.
   The campaign was largely bereft of issues, focusing instead on
personalities.
   The opposition charged the National Front with economic
mismanagement and cronyism and said it was indifferent to ethnic
tensions and eroding judicial powers.
   Mahathir dismissed the accusations as groundless and derided the
opposition's promise of tax cuts as ``the height of
irresponsibility.''
   Voter turnout ranged from 60 percent to 70 percent across the
nation. The nation's 7.9 million voters are not required by law to
cast ballots.
   Polling began Saturday in remote areas of Sabah and Sarawak
states and in the rest of the country Sunday.
   Mahathir narrowly defeated Razaleigh in a 1987 contest for the
leadership of the United Malays National Organization, the key
party in the governing coalition.
   Malaysia has been ruled by a multiracial coalition led by the
United Malays ever since independence in 1957.
   Political parties are essentially based on race. The National
Front coalition also includes the Malaysian Chinese Association,
Malaysian Indian Congress and seven smaller parties.
   Malays comprise about 53 percent of the population of 17.8
million. Chinese make up about 32 percent, with Indians and other
races making up the balance.
   In seven earlier national elections, a fragmented opposition
made little headway against the National Front, establishing only
regional power bases.
   But this time, the electorate had an organized alternative
representing the same ethnic mosaic as the National Front.

   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
agreement today on a wide-ranging clean air bill that will require
factories, automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically
over the next decade.
   The legislation, which toughens federal air pollution laws for
the first time in 13 years, was expected to be formally approved by
a House-Senate conference, possibly later today, and then go back
to the two chambers for endorsement.
   Congress began considering the clean air measure more than a
year ago.
   The compromise bill retains a five-year, $250 million aid
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher
pollution controls. The White House had objected to financial
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included.
   But the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the
provision after language was included to keep the program from
becoming too costly.
   White House aides when departing from the talks did not repeat
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt
President Bush would scuttle the long-sought clean air legislation
on that job-loss assistance issue.
   Agreement on the last sections of the massive bill, which covers
nearly 700 pages, came as House and Senate negotiators worked
through most of night Sunday and much of the early morning today.
Congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend
to give it enough time to clear Congress before adjournment Friday.
   The bill's controls, aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, are expected to touch
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between $22
billion and $25 billion when all its provisions go into effect.
   Negotiators reached agreement early Sunday on steep pollution
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain. Coal-burning
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur
dioxide releases almost in half, reducing annual emissions by about
10 million tons by the year 2001.
   The acid rain provision, which will hit utilities and consumers
of electricity in the industrial Midwest the hardest, was the last
major section of the bill to be resolved. Agreements had been
reached previously that cut smog-causing emissions from automobiles
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses.
   ``We're getting real protection. It meets the acid test on acid
rain,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., a leading proponent of
acid rain curbs.
   The House-Senate conferees struggled since mid-July to resolve
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the House and
Senate.
   For weeks there was only modest progress, but the pace quickened
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the
massive and technically complex legislation. Among the major
provisions:
   - Utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by
10 million tons, or nearly in half, by installing ``scrubbers'' or
switching to low-sulfur coal. They also must cut nitrogen oxides,
which also contribute to acid rain.
   - About 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years,
depending on the severity of the problem, by reduce smog-causing
emissions. Los Angeles is given 20 years.
   - Industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the
next decade. Only the steel industry's coke ovens would be given
more time, until 2020. Even stronger pollution control measures
could be required if the Environmental Protection Agency concludes
that residents near a plant are not ensured ``an amble margin of
safety'' from the risk of cancer.
   - Pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phase-in
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets. A California pilot program
also would require 300,000 personal cars powered by alternative
fuels by 1999. It could be copied by other states.
   - Oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities
with the worst smog problems. The requirement is aimed at pushing
the sale of ``reformulated'' gasoline or blends that include
additives such as ethanol.
   The measures affecting factories, thousands of small businesses,
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive.
But environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by
savings in health care because of the cleaner air.
   The controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the
industrial Midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest
plants because of their heavy reliance on high-sulfur coal.
   In final bargaining, Midwest lawmakers gained some additional
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution
devices, especially over the first five years. Negotiators,
however, rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially, according to congressional
sources.
   Early today, the House and Senate negotiators also agreed to
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore
oil rigs, an issue pressed by California lawmakers. Rigs off the
Gulf of Mexico, however, are exempt.
   Meanwhile, a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks
was taken out of the bill. Several western senators had threatened
to block the legislation on the Senate floor if it contained the
visibility provision. The compromise calls for park visibility to
be studied.

   Premier Hau Pei-tsun today protested
Japan's move to block two Taiwanese ships from reaching a disputed
island chain and warned of ``effective measures'' if Japan harasses
Taiwanese ships in the area.
   ``We launch the severest protest against Japan's unfriendly
harassment of our fishing boats,'' Hau said after an emergency
Cabinet meeting.
   He also urged Japan to tear down a lighthouse built on one of
the eight unpopulated islands that make up the chain in the East
China Sea.
   They are known as the Senkaku Islands to the Japanese and the
Diaoyutai Islands to Taiwan and China.
   Japanese coast guard patrol boats turned back two Taiwanese
fishing vessels approaching the islets on Sunday. The Taiwanese
boats sought to land a delegation of politicians and athletes to
plant national flags on one of the islets, Uotsuri, to reinforce a
claim to the territory by Taiwan's Nationalist Chinese government.
   In Tokyo, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official said the islands
are ``our country's native territory and it is regrettable that
such an action was conducted'' by the Taiwan boats.
   ``Our government handled the matter according to related laws,''
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In Taipei, about 30 Taiwanese pelted Japan's unofficial embassy
with eggs, and demonstrators said they opposed what they called the
``revival of Japan's militarism.''
   In the southern city of Kaohsiung, protesters burned a Japanese
flag.
   Like most countries, Japan does not recognize Taiwan. It
maintains close trade ties with the island nation, but has
diplomatic relations with Taiwan's longtime enemy, Communist China.
   Uotsuri, about 2{ miles long and one mile wide, is the largest
of the disputed islands. Five of the eight islets are no more than
rocks.
   The area, however, is regarded as a rich fishing ground, and
also is believed to contain oil deposits. Taiwanese fishermen have
been known to shelter in the islets during storms.
   The islets are 270 miles southwest of Naha, capital of the
Japanese island prefecture of Okinawa, and 95 miles northwest of
the nearest neighboring Japanese island, Iriomotejima. They are 118
miles northesat of Taiwan.
   Premier Hau said the government supported Sunday's ``patriotic''
efforts.
   ``Japanese authorities must not deter our boats from fishing
near Diaoyutai waters, or we will take effective measures to
protect such fishing activities when necessary,'' Hau said. He did
not elaborate.
   The islands were claimed by Japan in 1895.
   But the Nationalists, who claim to be the legitimate rulers of
all of China, say the islets came under Chinese sovereignty in 1945
when Japan was defeated in World War II. In 1949, the Nationalists
lost a civil war to the Chinese Communists and fled mainland China
to Taiwan.
   The United States took over administration of the islets after
the war and returned them to Japan, along with Okinawa, in 1972.
   The Communist government in China laid claim to the islands in
1971 and reiterated the claim last week.
   The latest dispute followed reports that a Japanese right-wing
political group had received permission from the Japanese
government to renovate a lighthouse on one of the islands.
   The issue has touched a raw nerve among Taiwanese who suffered
much during Japan's occupation of the island from 1895 to 1945.

struck dead in an unrelated train accident, authorities said.
   An Amtrak train enroute from Los Angeles to San Diego Sunday
scattered the bodies of a man and woman about 60 yards apart.
Another man was in serious condition at Scripps Memorial Hospital
in La Jolla, nursing supervisor Carla Dadd said.
   Three others were treated for minor injuries and released.
   ``Trespassers were playing cards and drinking on the track,''
said Arthur Lloyd, an Amtrak spokesman in San Francisco. ``The

<TEXT>
   Tom Carvel, a drummer-turned-ice cream
maker who parlayed a $15 loan during the Depression from his future
wife into a fortune, has died at age 84.
   Carvel, who died at home Sunday of undetermined causes, was the
gravel-voiced spokesman on television and radio for his Carvel
Corp., the nation's third-largest ice cream store chain after Dairy
Queen and Haagen-Dazs.
   Carvel Corp., based in Yonkers, has more than 700 stores, most
of them in New York, Florida, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Jersey and other East Coast states.
   In 1989, Carvel sold his 99 percent share in the Carvel Corp.
for more than $80 million to an investment bank, Investcorp, and
stayed on as a consultant.
   Carvel founded the ice cream company in 1938. He began narrating
his own commercials in 1955, and his pitches to ``please visit your
local Carvel store'' became known to millions.
   His commercials promoted Fudgie the Whale and Cookie Puss ice
cream cakes, Flying Saucers ice cream sandwiches and Thinny Thin
dietary frozen dessert.
   Despite criticism of his diction and syntax, Carvel never edited
for flubs and said his commercials ``are for the people who look
like us, talk like us and sound like us.''
   Carvel was credited with paving the way for corporate chairmen
like Lee Iacocca and Victor Kiam to make their own commercials.
   Born Thomas Andreas Carvelas in Greece, Carvel emigrated to the
United States when he was 4. His family settled in Connecticut.
   In the 1920s, Carvel played drums in a Dixieland band and worked
as an auto mechanic before borrowing $15 from his future wife in
1934 to sell ice cream. He later opened his first ice cream store
in Hartsdale, a New York City suburb.
   In the mid-1920s, Carvel invented the first machine to make soft
ice cream.
   He is survived by his wife of 53 years, Agnes, and a brother.

   The robber captivated the Israeli public by
holding up 22 banks and making off on a motorcycle. But the suspect
in custody apparently is anything but a latter-day Robin Hood.
   Police on Sunday identified the suspect as an heir to millions
who allegedly turned to crime to pay his debts.
   Dozens of Israeli press and broadcast reports had chronicled his
exploits, and his helmeted image adorned T-shirts and decal
stickers. In news reports, he was nicknamed ``Bikerbank.''
   But the man, identified by police as Roni Leibovitz, tried to
fight that image in an interview with army radio today. He said he
was not a hero, and had made ``a terrible mistake,'' the radio said
in the interview.
   ``All of this attention I am getting - I am not a hero, not a
folk hero or a hero of any other type,'' Leibovitz was quoted as
saying. ``They are creating me as they want. I made a terrible
mistake.''
   He was quoted as saying the robberies were a ``result of
pressure on me ... of certain family circumstances, certain
environmental circumstances.''
   Many Israelis were shocked to learn that Leibovitz, arrested
Thursday, was the suspect.
   The 37-year-old man's family runs a large Israeli food products
company and several businesses in New York.
   Leibovitz, in custody in Tel Aviv, has acknowledged taking
$175,000 from banks but had no charitable goal for the loot, police
said.
   ``When asked what his motive was, he said `money.' He said he
did not want to take revenge against police or the banks; he did
not want to be a national hero, but needed the money because of his
debts,'' Tel Aviv police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad said Sunday.
   The deputy police superintendent who headed the investigation,
Chaim Pinchas, said Leibovitz was as meticulous in his planning
``as an army operations officer,'' but not so in his financial
affairs. He owed more than $1 million, Pinchas said.
   The bandit would walk into a bank wearing a crash helmet and
fire one shot in the air from a .38-caliber pistol. He always
robbed the teller nearest the door, then disappeared on a
high-powered motorcycle. No one was ever hurt.
   Leibovitz had unsuccessfully tried to run family ventures in
Israel, according to the Israeli media.
   Newspapers described his privileged life and a large villa he
started to build in Herzliya Pituach, a wealthy seaside area near
Tel Aviv.
   Leibovitz was arrested at his parents' Israeli home after he
attempted to rob a bank in suburban Tel Aviv. Police said they
found the motorcycle and pistol allegedly used in the robberies in
the garden.
   Police say he had had an initial hearing and will be charged
soon. He has so far accompanied police to about half of his robbery
sites to show them how it was done.
   But even with the arrest, the myth did not die completely.
   As Leibovitz was taken to a Haifa bank on Friday to recreate one
robbery, hundreds of Israelis gathered outside and applauded.

<HEAD>Another Protest in Korean Spying Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students hurled firebombs
today at a main office of the South Korean intelligence agency and
demanded that the government stop spying on dissidents. Police said
eight protesters were arrested.
   A number of students hurled about 20 firebombs in the predawn
attack on an office in central Seoul of the Agency for National
Security Planning, formerly called the Korean Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Police said the students burned a car, scattered leaflets
demanding the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo, and shouted slogans
insisting that intelligence units be disbanded.
   About 20 intelligence and police officers, firing blanks and
tear gas, immediately surrounded and arrested eight protesters
trapped on an elevated road, police and news reports said.
   In declaring war on crime and violence last week, Roh gave
police permission to open fire when necessary.
   It was not immediately clear whether the firebombs damaged the
office. Intelligence officers declined to comment and blocked
access to the building housing one of the security agency's two
main offices in Seoul.
   Police said a firebomb exploded at an adjacent police
substation, scorching a motorcycle, but no injuries were reported.
Intelligence officers took the eight protesters away for
questioning, they said.
   The students' leaflets, titled ``The Reason for Our Attack on
the Agency,'' accused Roh of stepping up ``suppression of the
democratic movement'' and declard war on his government.
   Government intelligence offices have been the target of sporadic
protests by dissidents and radical students since a scandal
involving a military intelligence unit spying on civilians surfaced
early this month.
   The attack today came as Roh was urging police to end social
unrest and crime. In a televised speech commemorating police day,
Roh asked police officers to concentrate all their power on ending
crime and civil disorders.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher in Light Trading, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose slightly today against other major
currencies in light trading in Europe.
   Gold prices fell in part because of weakening world oil prices,
bullion dealers said.
   Foreign exchange dealers said trading was generally quiet. The
first major economic indicator for the week is not due for release
until Wednesday when U.S. durable goods orders for September are to
be announced.
   A trader in Milan said ``it's becoming pretty clear'' that the
seven major industrialized nations, known as the Group of Seven,
have lowered their ``acceptable dollar range.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1 yen to a closing 126.25 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at a fractionally lower rate of 126.20
yen.
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9490 compared with
$1.9590 late Friday.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning in Europe compared with late
rates Friday included:
   -1.5080 German marks, up from 1.5040.
   -1.2735 Swiss francs, up from 1.2700.
   -5.0505 French francs, up from 5.0380.
   -1.6995 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6940.
   -1,128.00 Italian lire, up from 1,127.00.
   -1.1710 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$368.50 per ounce at midmorning, down from $372.75 per ounce late
Friday.
   In Zurich, gold was bid at $369.10 an ounce, down from $372.50
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.22 an ounce to $371.36.
   Silver traded in London at a bid of $4.22 a troy ounce, down
from $4.28 late Friday.

<TEXT>
   Tom King and Vivian Taylor's plans
for a quiet wedding atop North America's second tallest bridge were
gone with the wind when a couple of thousand spectators crowded in.
   The Memphis, Tenn., couple were wed on Saturday during the 11th
annual Bridge Day, when hundreds of parachutists bounded off the
876-foot New River Gorge Bridge to land on the banks of the New
River.
   The wedding was not without its glitches. Some wedding guests
were crowded out of the ceremony, a couple of guests were barred
from jumping because organizers felt they weren't qualified for a
windy-day jump, and one groomsman was cited on a trespassing charge
after he landed in the wrong place.
   Bridge Day is the only day of the year that jumping is allowed
on the New River Gorge Bridge. It's the premier event for members
of the U.S. BASE Association, whose members like to jump off
stationary objects like buildings, bridges and cliffs, sometimes
without legal sanction. BASE stands for building, antenna, span and
earth.
   King, a veteran BASE jumper, wanted to marry in a special roped
area on the bridge before taking the plunge with two groomsmen and
three wedding guests.
   But the crowd wouldn't let him. King, Taylor and their guests
couldn't move past the center of the bridge reserved for jumping.
They married instead on a wooden portable staircase, while
screaming people pushed each other for a closer view.
   Some guests missed the wedding entirely because they were
waiting elsewhere on the bridge.
   ``They ended up getting married in the wrong spot,'' said
groomsman Mark Worthen.
   Worthen had problems of his own. After jumping, he landed on
railroad tracks instead of the riverbank and was promptly cited for
trespassing by railroad police.
   ``I told him `I didn't land here on purpose,' and (the officer)
said, `Did someone push you off that bridge?''' Worthen said.
   Worthen now must return to court in Fayette County to face a
trespassing charge.
   On Saturday, King took the plunge with another groomsman, Andy
Calistrat, trailing a blue banner reading ``Just Married'' behind
him. The new bride is jumping enthusiast, too - but only as a
spectator.
   Bridge jumping was described by participants as ``high anxiety
followed by total euphoria'' and ``a rush.'' Jumpers pull their
parachute cords three seconds after leaping and slow to a landing
in about eight seconds, after reaching speeds of 60 mph.
   Three parachutists suffered leg injuries and a fourth hit his
head on a rock on the riverbank when his parachute snagged a tree
branch, officials said. All the injuries were minor.
   More than 20 jumpers landed in the water and were pulled from
strong currents by people in rescue boats, officials said.

   More than 700 people marked the first
anniversary of the abduction of an 11-year-old boy with tears,
music and testimonials, saying his absence ``crushes you inside.''
   ``We are not giving up, no matter what,'' Sister Pauline
Fernandes said Sunday before the vigil at a church less than two
miles from where Jacob Wetterling was snatched by a masked gunman
on Oct. 22, 1989.
   Fernandes, a Roman Catholic nun who has regularly volunteered
time to the foundation working for Jacob's return, said the
anniversary has reinforced the hopes of many who believe Jacob will
be found alive.
   The boy's parents, Jerry and Patty Wetterling, attended Sunday's
vigil but did not speak to the crowd about 700. They also were to
attend a tree planting ceremony this afternoon at Centennial Park
in St. Joseph to mark the anniversary.
   Carol Keller of St. Augusta, a frequent volunteer at the Jacob
Wetterling Foundation, said supporters of the family are still
working hard t keep the public aware of Jacob's abduction. The
foundation continues to average about 2,000 mailings a day, she
said.
   ``He's coming back, that's a promise,'' Mrs. Keller said.
   ``Jacob we miss you, we want you home,'' Ron Marotte, a director
of the foundation, said Sunday night at the vigil at St. Joseph's
Catholic Church.
   ``Can I say something to him?'' Dottie Bradford, 33, of Key
Biscayne, Fla., asked minutes before the vigil. ``Everybody loves
you and we hope you're home soon.''
   Bradford said she hasn't been able to keep Jacob out of her
thoughts since she heard of his plight on a television show.
   ``Just looking at (pictures of) his face it kind of takes your
heart,'' she said. ``The best way to sum it up is that it crushes
you inside.''
   Stearns County Sheriff Charlie Grafft said a nationwide search
for the boy has failed to find a trace of him. He said a new
suspect was being checked out, but said people should not get their
hopes up unduly.
   At the vigil, the congregation prayed for the boy's protection
and return.
   ``Bless the abductor with your love and forgiveness so that
Jacob may be released to his family,'' the group said in a prayer
that many in the town of 1,300 have memorized.
   The Minnesota Gospel Twins called for people in the church to
start a three-day fast and sang ``He Has Never Failed Yet.''

<HEAD>CIA Defector in Moscow Says He Has Traveled in West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first CIA agent to defect to the Soviet
Union says he has traveled widely in the West since he fled the
United States five years ago, according to an interview with The
Washington Post.
   ``I don't think any secret service can deal with multiple names,
multiple passports,'' Edward Lee Howard said in an interview from
Moscow published today in the Post.
   Howard said he has dodged Western intelligence services and
customs officials while traveling in France, Canada and Mexico. He
also said he has traveled widely in Nicaragua, Cuba and Eastern
Europe since asking for asylum in June 1986.
   Howard said he did the traveling ``for fun'' and over the
objection of the KGB.
   The Post said the interview, resulting in Howard's first
published remarks since a series of meetings with author David Wise
more than three years ago, was conducted over a four-hour period at
Howard's dacha outside Moscow and at a restaurant in Moscow.
   Asked why he decided to talk, Howard said he was replying to an
item in a recent news magazine report that said he had committed
suicide. Howard maintained the CIA had planted the item as a
``deliberate plot to get me to surface.''
   ``They hit me, I hit them,'' he said. ``Very simple. I know why
they want to hit me. there have been traces of me in the West. They
know I've been there.''
   Howard insisted that ``I love my country - America,'' but said
he is ``waging war with the CIA,'' which forced him to resign.
   He fled the United States after U.S. authorities accused him of
spying for the Soviet Union.
   Howard has maintained consistently that he was not a Soviet spy.
``I'm a political refugee and defector,'' he said.

<HEAD>Nation's Largest Cities Hit by 20 Percent Increase in Murders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Murders in the nation's largest cities jumped
20 percent in the first half of the year, the FBI reports.
   The big-city murder rate contributed to an overall 10 percent in
violent crime reported by the nation's police departments, the FBI
said in a report released Sunday.
   Overall, the number of crimes reported to state and local police
departments increased less than 1 percent during the first six
months of the year over the same period last year, the FBI said.
   But the bureau's Uniform Crime Index reported that violent
crimes - murder, aggravated assault, rape and robbery - went up 10
percent during the period that ended June 30.
   Murders increased 8 percent nationwide but in cities with
populations greater than 1 million they were up 20 percent during
the period, the FBI said. Murders increased 10 percent in cities
with populations between 500,000 and 1 million.
   The jump in violent crimes was the largest since 1986, when it
increased 12.1 percent over 1985. It was also twice the 5 percent
increases posted during the first six months of both 1988 and 1989.
   By region, the Northeast led the way with an 18 percent jump in
murders, followed by an 8 percent increase in the West. Murders
went up 4 percent in the South and 5 percent in the Midwest.
   In response to the report, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, complained that ``drug dealers are
battling over turf, and we are waging an anemic war to stop it.''
   ``Deadly weapons are being used to slaughter innocent
bystanders, and the gun lobby is blocking action to stop it,''
Biden, D-Del., said in a statement. ``We have a national bloodbath
on our hands and we must get serious about stopping the killing,''
Biden said.
   Dan Eramian, a spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh,
called the figures ``further evidence of the need to pass a crime
bill that is tough on criminals.''
   Rapes were up 10 percent, with the biggest increases occurring
in medium-sized cities.
   The number of rapes reported to police in cities with
populations between 100,000 and 250,000 went up 16 percent. Cities
with populations between 250,000 and 500,000 reported rapes
increasing by 15 percent.
   Robberies increased 9 percent and car thefts were up 6 percent.
   Burglaries declined 5 percent and thefts were down 1 percent.
   Suburban areas posted an 8 percent jump in violent crimes,
including a 1 percent jump in murders. The increase in violent
crime also reached rural areas, where it went up 3 percent.

   President Elias Hrawi's government is
moving to accelerate the process of unifying Beirut, disbanding
rival militias and freeing Western hostages, aides said today.
   They said plans were made during two days of talks in Damascus
between Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who renewed a
pledge to support efforts to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Hrawi returned to Beirut on Sunday night, hours after gunmen
killed Christian leader Dany Chamoun, 56, his wife and two young
sons at their home in suburban Baabda.
   Today, the Christian area staged a day-long shutdown to protest
the slayings, which came a week after Hrawi's army and Syrian
troops crushed the mutiny of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun. The
general took refuge in the French Embassy.
   Chamoun, the younger son of the late President Camille Chamoun,
supported Aoun. Aoun's headquarters had been in Baabda.
   Pro-Syrian groups blamed the killings on Christian warlord Samir
Geagea, whose Lebanese Forces militia fought an unsuccessful
four-month war with Aoun's troops for mastery of the Christian
heartland northeast of Beirut early this year.
   Geagea denied involvement in Chamoun's killing. He joined other
Christian and Moslem leaders in urging Hrawi's government to bring
peace to the area that had been controlled by Aoun's forces.
   Hrawi told Syrian state television his government was resolved
to end the militia control of Beirut.
   ``All militias will be disbanded by peaceful means, but we will
use other means if we face objections,'' Hrawi said. ``I warn
everybody that no opposition by the gun or the cannon will be
tolerated.''
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss headed for Damascus today for talks
with Syrian leaders on ways to end the 15-year division of
Christian east Beirut and Moslem west Beirut.
   A Hrawi aide said that within two weeks, the government wants
Geagea's men to give the Lebanese army control of the three east
Beirut districts they hold.
   ``If the Lebanese Forces agree to a peaceful handover, then
there will be no need for Syrian troops to enter east Beirut like
they did with Aoun's zone. The ball is in Geagea's court,'' the
aide said.
   He said the army also hopes to peacefully assume control of
Beirut's Shiite Moslem southern slums from Hezbollah, the umbrella
for pro-Iranian factions holding most of the 13 Western hostages in
Lebanon.
   Hrawi's aide said the Syrian government plans to discuss the
slums' fate with Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran this
week.
   ``This (the talks) will definitely include the fate of the
Western hostages, whether they still are held in the slums or
smuggled out to the Bekaa Valley,'' the aide said.
   ``There is a Syrian-Lebanese understanding that the hostage
issue should be resolved correspondingly with the creation of
Greater Beirut irrespective of where the hostages are being held.
Wherever they are, the Syrians control the access,'' he said.
   Two Lebanese army intelligence officers told The Associated
Press last week that six American and two British hostages were
spirited from south Beirut to east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley before
the attack on Aoun's enclave Oct. 13.
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League mandate. They control more than 70 percent of Lebanon's
territory, including the Bekaa Valley.

<HEAD>Former Romanian Leader Criticizes End of Security Chief's Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former member of Romania's revolutionary
government has bitterly criticized the suspension of the trial of
the late dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's secret police chief.
   In a weekend telephone interview with The Associated Press,
Silviu Brucan said the decision by a military court in Bucharest to
suspend the trial of Gen. Iulian Vlad was an ``international
scandal.''
   The military court trying Vlad on charges of complicity to
genocide acted Friday, citing insufficient evidence against the
former head of Securitate, the Ceausescu regime's secret police.
   Brucan, a writer and former ambassador to the United States, had
been under house arrest when Ceausescu fell last December, and
became the second ranking official in the National Council of
Salvation which took over the government.
   He later quit the council to protest its inclusion of high
officials from the Ceausescu regime.
   ``Vlad controlled the most monstrous repression machine in
Eastern Europe,'' Brucan said, adding it was ``wrong only to have
tried him only on the limited charges of complicity in genocide
from December 17 to December 23 of last year.''
   The charge stemmed from the alleged killing of more than 1,000
Romanians by Securitate troops during the revolution that toppled
Ceausescu. Vlad faced a maximum sentance of life in prison if
convicted.
   Brucan said the story had been framed ``to avoid an examination
of Securitate itself, and its criminal activity'' during the
Ceausescu regime.
   Brucan is in the United States on a lecture tour that includes
visits to Dartmouth College in New Hampshire and Tulane University
in Lousianna.
   One of the earliest members of the Romanian Communist Party,
Brucan was frequently harassed and imprisoned by the Securitate
after he broke with the Ceausescu government.

   A letter from Americans and other
foreigners complaining about their detention at strategic sites in
Iraq reached a Western embassy today, diplomats said.
   A photocopy of the handwritten letter, minus the signatures, was
distributed to reporters. It referred to foreigners detained inside
a gas storage terminal by Iraqi officials. They are among those
being held by Iraq to try to deter attack following its invasion
Aug. 2 of Kuwait.
   The letter said:
   ``The camp inside the LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) storage
terminal compound is in an extremely dangerous location and in the
event of fire or explosion resulting from any reason whatsoever, it
would be impossible for camp occupants to survive.
   ``Disregarding our strong protests, the persons named herein
have been forced to move into this camp.
   ``This is contrary to international law, the Helsinki Accord on
Human Rights and the promises of his excellency the president, Mr.
Saddam Hussein, who has stated that the guests would be housed
alongside of Iraqi residents and share the same risks as Iraqi
citizens.
   ``We, the undersigned, continue to protest this immoral and
illegal act and herewith demand that we be permitted to contact our
respective embassies and inform embassy personnel of this inhuman
action being taken by representatives of the Ministry of
Petroleum.''
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition they were not
identified further, said they believed the signatories were
Americans and other foreigners.
   The diplomats declined to say how many signatures were on the
letter. There was no immediate clue to the location of the plant
mentioned in the letter.
   When asked how the letter was received, one diplomat said it
``came along with the mail.'' But he did not say if it had actually
been stamped and postmarked, or just slipped into a regular mail
delivery.
   About 600 Americans, Britons, Germans, Japanese and other
foreigners are being held at strategic sites in Iraq, according to
sources. The number is believed to include about 100 Americans,
they added.
   Diplomats said they have not been allowed to visit their
citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins is set to announce that he's
cutting his own pay and that of hundreds of top officials by 5
percent, according to a report published today.
   The wage cuts - 5 percent for officials earning at least $70,000
annually - would affect 44 mayoral aides, 60 commissioners, and
nearly 350 deputy or assistant commissioners, the Daily News said
in today's editions. The story quoted unidentified senior Dinkins
administration officials.
   Dinkins himself would lose $6,500 from his $130,000-a-year
salary.
   The city has been plagued by a budget shortfall caused in part
by a slowdown in the city's economy.
   In addition to the pay cuts for top officials, Dinkins planned
to freeze the pay of 3,800 municipal managers with salaries of more
than $40,000, the News said. The cuts and freezes would be
effective immediately and stay in effect until fiscal year 1992.
   The city would save $25 million from the wage freezes and $1.2
million from the pay cuts.

   A Palestinian youth stabbed an Israeli delivery
man in Jerusalem today as police sent 2,000 reinforcements into the
city and set up roadblocks to keep Arab visitors out.
   Police said the travel ban was intended to prevent assaults on
Jews. They said they also feared Jews might attack Palestinians to
avenge the killings Sunday of three Jews by an Arab assailant.
   Scattered clashes were reported today between stone-throwing
Palestinians and Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. At least 18 Palestinians were shot and wounded by troops,
Arab reports said.
   An Arab youth attacked a soldier with an ax today in a military
government building in the Gaza town of Rafah, Arab and Israeli
reports said. On Sunday night, a soldier was assaulted by an
attacker armed with a knife in the Gaza town of Khan Yunis. Both
soldiers were slightly wounded, radio reports said.
   Police said a 46-year-old Israeli, Moshe Koren, was slightly
wounded in the back when he was attacked by a Palestinian today as
he unloaded his meat truck outside a supermarket. The Palestinian
was a delivery boy at the market.
   Koren told Israel radio, ``I turned and saw him running away
with a bayonet.''
   Police pursued the assailant, who escaped by running toward Arab
villages in the West Bank, the radio said.
   Also today, family and friends buried the last of the three
Israelis stabbed to death Sunday in Jerusalem.
   The victim, Charlie Chelouche, 28, was an off-duty policeman who
managed to shoot the assailant in both legs before he was killed.
The two other victims were buried Sunday.
   The attacker was captured and has been identified by police as
Omar Abu Sirhan, 19, a construction worker from the West Bank
village of Ubbadiyeh.
   Police said he apparently acted alone and intended to avenge the
Oct. 8 police killings of at least 19 Palestinians on Jerusalem's
Temple Mount. The shootings on the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as
Haram al-Sharif, came after Palestinians stoned Jews praying at the
nearby Western Wall.
   Israeli newspapers said Abu Sirhan had no police record and that
he told interrogators he also wanted revenge because he was beaten
by three Jews several years ago.
   Police officials said they would decide late today whether to
continue the ban on Palestinians entering Jerusalem.
   National Police spokesman Adi Gonen said there was concern that
``in a tense situation, there can be cases where hot-headed people
beat the Arabs.''
   Arab reports said some Palestinian-owned vehicles were stoned in
Kfar Sabah north of Tel Aviv, but no injuries were reported. On
Sunday night, three Jews attacked a Palestinian youth with a sharp
instrument in east Jerusalem, injuring him slightly, the radio
said.
   Jerusalem is home to 350,000 Jews and 150,000 Palestinians.
Israel captured the Arab eastern sector from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East War and later annexed it. Most Western countries do not
recognize Israeli rule in the eastern portion.
   Some newspaper editorials urged the government to consider
permanently barring West Bank and Gaza Strip residents from
entering Israel.
   ``A substantial problem exists,'' the Hebrew daily Maariv said.
``Jews are still being killed simply for being Jews.''
   Amir Cheshin, adviser on Arab affairs to Jerusalem Mayor Teddy
Kollek, suggested the violence could cause irreparable harm.
   ``We are returning to a normalcy with scars of our wounds. We
won't forget and they won't forget,'' he said on the radio.
   Also today, Israeli leaders urged increased security measures.
   ``We need an increase in security to overcome this insane
terrorism,'' Justice Minister Dan Meridor said.
   Measures being considered included random searches of Arabs in
Israel and allowing troops to fire more freely at Arab protesters,
Israeli media said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's senior adviser, Avi Pazner,
sought to lay some blame for Sunday's slayings on the U.N. Security
Council, which condemned Israel for the Temple Mount killings.
   He said the U.S.-supported condemnation created ``an atmosphere
that incites extremist actions against innocent Jewish civilians.''
   Israel has refused to cooperate with a U.N.-ordered
investigation of the Temple Mount shootings.

   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
agreement today on a wide-ranging clean air bill that will require
factories, automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically
over the next decade.
   The legislation, which toughens federal air pollution laws for
the first time in 13 years, was expected to be formally approved by
a House-Senate conference, possibly later today, and then go back
to the two chambers for endorsement.
   The bill's controls, aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, are expected to touch
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between $22
billion and $25 billion when all its provisions go into effect.
   Under the legislation, pollution from automobiles would be cut
30 percent to 60 percent, oil companies would be required to
provide cleaner gasoline, industries would reduce the amount of
toxic chemicals released into the air and about 100 cities would be
ordered to meet federal air quality standards.
   The compromise bill retains a five-year, $250 million aid
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher
pollution controls. The White House had objected to financial
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included.
   But the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the
provision after language was included to keep the program from
becoming too costly.
   White House aides when departing from the talks did not repeat
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt
President Bush would scuttle the long-sought clean air legislation
on that job-loss assistance issue.
   Congress began considering the clean air measure more than a
year ago.
   Agreement on the last sections of the massive bill, which covers
nearly 700 pages, came as House and Senate negotiators worked
through most of night Sunday and much of the early morning today.
Congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend
to give it enough time to clear Congress before adjournment Friday.
   Negotiators reached agreement early Sunday on steep pollution
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain. Coal-burning
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur
dioxide releases almost in half, reducing annual emissions by about
10 million tons by the year 2001.
   The acid rain provision, which will hit utilities and consumers
of electricity in the industrial Midwest the hardest, was the last
major section of the bill to be resolved. Agreements had been
reached previously that cut smog-causing emissions from automobiles
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses.
   ``We're getting real protection. It meets the acid test on acid
rain,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., a leading proponent of
acid rain curbs.
   The House-Senate conferees struggled since mid-July to resolve
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the House and
Senate.
   For weeks there was only modest progress, but the pace quickened
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the
massive and technically complex legislation. Among the major
provisions:
   - Utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by
10 million tons, or nearly in half, by installing ``scrubbers'' or
switching to low-sulfur coal. They also must cut nitrogen oxides,
which also contribute to acid rain.
   - About 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years,
depending on the severity of the problem, by reduce smog-causing
emissions. Los Angeles is given 20 years.
   - Industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the
next decade. Only the steel industry's coke ovens would be given
more time, until 2020. Even stronger pollution control measures
could be required if the Environmental Protection Agency concludes
that residents near a plant are not ensured ``an amble margin of
safety'' from the risk of cancer.
   - Pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phase-in
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets. A California pilot program
also would require 300,000 personal cars powered by alternative
fuels by 1999. It could be copied by other states.
   - Oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities
with the worst smog problems. The requirement is aimed at pushing
the sale of ``reformulated'' gasoline or blends that include
additives such as ethanol.
   The measures affecting factories, thousands of small businesses,
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive.
But environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by
savings in health care because of the cleaner air.
   The controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the
industrial Midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest
plants because of their heavy reliance on high-sulfur coal.
   In final bargaining, Midwest lawmakers gained some additional
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution
devices, especially over the first five years. Negotiators,
however, rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially, according to congressional
sources.
   Early today, the House and Senate negotiators also agreed to
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore
oil rigs, an issue pressed by California lawmakers. Rigs off the
Gulf of Mexico, however, are exempt.
   Meanwhile, a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks
was taken out of the bill. Several western senators had threatened
to block the legislation on the Senate floor if it contained the
visibility provision. The compromise calls for park visibility to
be studied.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ambassador David Tothill of South
Africa today criticized black leader Nelson Mandela for playing on
the ``heartstrings of the Western democracies'' to raise money.
   Hours before Mandela was to reach Canberra, the federal capital,
to begin a four-day visit to Australia, Tothill addressed a Foreign
Correspondents Association luncheon. He told the reporters Mandela
is not the clear-cut leader of all blacks in South Africa.
   ``Many Australians seem to believe that the negotiations (for a
new South African Constitution) are a subterfuge that will bring
about a handover of power to the ANC, whereupon Mr. Mandela will
become the country's first black president,'' said Tothill.
   ``However, the ANC itself recognizes that it is not the only
spokesman for black opinion. Their level of support cannot be
quantified until an election is held.
   Tothill said Mandela was a ``persona of the creation of the
international media.''
   The South African ambassador said he could not estimate what
Mandela's trip to Australia would raise for the ANC. Mandela's
itinerary includes a rally outside Sydney's Opera House on
Wednesday and a fund-raising dinner at a hotel.
   ``I have heard that his (Mandela's) tour of the United States
raised $10 million, but I would not like to guess what he might
achieve in Australia,'' Tothill said.
   Earlier this year, the South African government freed Mandela,
the ANC's deputy president, after 27 years in prison. The
government also legalized opposition groups and has announced a
partial lifting of the state of emergency in effect since 1986.
   The ANC, outlawed for many years for its armed opposition to the
white-led government, is working to end apartheid in South Africa
and give the vote to its 26 million blacks.
   Tothill said the steps already taken by the South African
government should bring an end to sanctions against his country. He
said Australia and Canada should drop their continued trade and
sporting sanctions.
   ``Australia and Canada should face the fact that unless they
take the lead, nothing will change,'' said Tothill. ``It is about
time that these important members of the Commonwealth established a
bottom line for themselves and fixed the goalposts firmly in the
ground so that they cannot again be shifted.''
   Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said sanctions
against South Africa would not be lifted because ``not enough has
changed yet.''
   ``The Separate Amenities Act has been repealed, but there are
many other pillars of apartheid still remaining intact including,
in particular, the constitutional prohibition on black people
voting,'' said Evans.
   ``It may be that it will be time to start progressively lifting
the sanctions before all those pillars have been removed, but I do
not think anybody is going to rush in to lift sanctions.''

   A crowd of 1,000 people did $40,000 worth
of damage in and near the South Dakota State University campus when
weekend homecoming revelry turned to rioting, authorities said.
   Court appearances were scheduled for today for some of the 50
people arrested. Those who were scheduled in court face felony
charges in connection with overturning a television news car
belonging to Sioux Falls station KSFY.
   The damage occurred Friday night and Saturday night during the
Hobo Day homecoming weekend at SDSU, a state-supported school with
an enrollment of more than 7,000 students.
   Several hundred people marched across campus toward downtown
Saturday, tearing down signs and light poles. Three fires were
started near the campus, and some students pelted authorities with
eggs and beer bottles when they responded to the fires.
   Reports indicated a campus police officer was kicked in the back
and a firefighter dislocated his shoulder as he worked to put out
one of the blazes. Both were treated at a hospital and released.
   By Sunday morning, few signs remained of the violence except for
the cardboard cartons and beer cans littering many streets near the
campus.
   ``Frankly, I think it's inexcusable,' said university President
Robert Wagner. He said the school would take steps to try to change
student behavior.
   ``It doesn't reflect well on our university and it doesn't
reflect well on our students in general,'' Wagner said.
   He called the violence the worst in years.
   Most of the arrests were on misdemeanor charges, including
intentional damage to property, aggravated assault, alcohol
violations, interfering with police work and fleeing police
officers. Police Chief Dennis Falken said most of those arrested
were students.
   ``This was nuts,'' said Shane McKay, an SDSU junior who lives
near the site of one of the bonfires. ``A little group of people
being drunk and stupid started it. Everybody just followed them to
see what had happened.''
   Although parties and mischief have been a part of Hobo Day, some
believe the violence has gotten worse in recent years since the
legal drinking age was raised to 21. Younger students can't be in
the bars anymore, so they attend off-campus house parties.

   Iran demanded today that Iraq free an
Iranian oil minister who was captured 10 years ago and said it
refused to believe that he was killed when he fell into enemy hands
at the outset of the Iran-Iraq war.
   The dispute over the captured minister comes just as the two
nations have begun to improve relations.
   Iraq began improving ties with Iran so it could move hundreds of
thousands of troops off its border toward Saudi Arabia, where they
have been in a standoff with a multinational force since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News agency demanded the
immediate release of the oil minister, Mohammed Tondguyan.
Tondguyan was believed to have been wounded and captured by Iraqi
forces while visiting a border oil field in October 1980, a month
after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.
   He was not among 75,000 prisoners of war of both sides who were
exchanged following the improvement of relations between the former
combatants. IRNA said Iraqi officials claimed at the end of the
exchange that Tondguyan was killed during the Iraqi attack on the
oilfield.
   But the Iranian official overseeing the POW exchange, Mohammad
Nazaran, was quoted by IRNA as saying Iran had ``live and
documented evidence'' that Tondguyan ``is alive and being held in a
secret Iraqi prison.''
   ``If Iraq has good will it should release him immediately,'' he
was quoted as saying in the report, which is monitored in Nicosia.
   The Iraqis claim all the Iranian prisoners were repatriated in
the monthlong swap, which was abruptly halted last month without
any explanation from either side.
   The Iranians and the International Committee of the Red Cross,
which coordinated the exchange, maintain Iraq still holds several
thousand Iranians.
   Nazaran said Iran is waiting for information about 24,000
Iranian prisoners whose fate was not known.
   Prisoners refusing to be repatriated would be interviewed by
officials of the International Red Cross. According to
international regulations, prisoners cannot be repatriated against
their will.
   Nazaran accused the Red Cross of being influenced by the
Iraq-based Iranian opposition group, ``Mujahedeen Khalq,'' or
People's Holy Warriors, in discouraging many Iranian prisoners from
returning home.
   Iran and Iraq resumed formal diplomatic relations last week, but
the POW issue has caused a chill in the improved climate.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, under heavy international
pressure following his invasion of Kuwait, accepted Iranian peace
terms in mid-August.
   The terms included shared sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, Iraqi withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory and the
exchange of prisoners.

<HEAD>NEA Chairman Denies Grant For Boston Exhibit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts has rejected a $40,000 grant to support an exhibit at a Boston
museum by an artist whose work includes sexual themes, a museum
official said today.
   The Institute of Contemporary Art received formal notification
last week that NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer had rejected the
grant, which had been recommended for approval by a review
committee, said Arthur Cohen, the ICA's marketing director.
   The money was earmarked for an exhibition by Mike Kelley, a
mixed-media artist from Los Angeles, museum officials said.
   ``It is almost unprecedented in the history of the NEA that an
application for a gallery is approved by a peer review panel and
then gets rejected by the director,'' said Cohen.
   ICA director David A. Ross said Kelley's work ``deals with
serious and critical issues in our culture, some of which deal with
the pathology of our times, some of which deal with the body and
references to sexuality and sociology, some of which deal with
nationality and nationalism, some of which deal with madness and
particular forms of modern schizophrenic behavior.''
   Ross said it was unlikely Frohnmayer would reverse his decision.
He said he did not know why the director objected to Kelley's
exhibit.
   Earlier this year, Frohnmayer rejected four other grants that
had been recommended by review panels. Those grants were to
individual artists involved in controversial works, not a museum or
gallery.
   Cohen said about two-thirds of all applications submitted to the
NEA are rejected by the peer panels, and that the artists approved
for grants are heavily scrutinized.
   ``This is a show about a very important artist,'' Cohen said.
   The NEA controversy began last year when Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and other conservatives in Congress objected to NEA funding
of works by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano.
   ``They start with the easiest things first - photography and
performance, where there is less of a historical precedent - and
then they get down to censorship of other kinds of work,'' Kelley
told The Boston Globe.
   The peer panel recommended the $40,000 grant after reviewing the
ICA's application for $60,000.
   The Kelley exhibit was scheduled to originate in Boston and tour
other museums across the nation and in Europe. ``We're going to do
the show no matter what,'' said ICA curator Elizabeth Sussman.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today ousted the
Communist Party chief from its upper house after his criticisms of
government reforms prompted
nationwide anti-Communist protests.
   The dismissal of Communist Chairman Vasil Mohorita followed
President Vaclav Havel's firing last week of Gen. Miroslav Vacek as
defense minister to regain civilian control of the military after
four decades of Communist rule.
   Stepping up the anti-Communist campaign ahead of local elections
in November, Havel today renewed his call for the abolition of the
Warsaw Pact, saying it is an ``outdated tool of Stalinist
expansion.''
   Mohorita was dismissed today from the 40-member Parliament
Presidium, the upper house in the 300-seat bicameral national
assembly that can pass legislation whenever the lower chamber is
not in session.
   Presidium members are chosen by the lower house in proportion to
the popular vote for each party the lower chamber. Legislators in
the lower chamber, the House of the People, voted 117-86 to replace
him, the state news agency CTK reported. Mohorita will remain a
deputy in the lower house.
   CTK did not say who would replace him in the Presidium.
   There was no official word on why Mohorita was replaced, but his
criticism of government reforms aimed at dismantling centralized
Communist rule and introducing a market economy probably played a
key role. His comments were criticized by officials and caused
anti-Communist protests nationwide.
   In a speech published earlier this month, Mohirita said high
unemployment and inflation from the reforms would be unacceptable.
He urged ``a hard and uncompromising struggle.'' The economic
reforms have been developed by Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus,
increasingly seen as a more conservative rival to Havel.
   In a broadcast on state radio, Havel today said Czechoslovakia
would propose to abolish the Warsaw Pact's joint military command
at a summit of the military alliance in Budapest, Hungary on Nov.
3-4.
   ``The Warsaw Pact is outdated, and it has lost its meaning ...
it was created as a tool of Stalinist expansion,'' Havel said.
   Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces invaded Czechoslovakia to crush
the 1968 attempt to reform Communist government there. A hard-line
government was installed that ruled until a popular uprising in
November 1989.
   Waning Soviet influence and the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Eastern Europe has also prompted calls for dissolution from other
former Moscow satellites such as Hungary.
   Hungary has said it will withdraw from the military part of the
Warsaw Pact next year if it is not dissolved before then.
   Havel acknowledged the need for the pact to continue in
existence as a ``practical tool'' in arms reduction talks, but
stressed that full abolition of the alliance should be the final
objective.

   Gunmen killed a union leader today,
and officials ordered armed escorts to ride passenger buses after
Communist rebels burned two buses in support of an impending
general strike.
   The strike called for Wednesday by the country's major labor
federations is intended to press for a wage increase President
Corazon Aquino has said is ``unrealistic.''
   Police said Oscar Lazaro, 53, chief of an association of
passenger jeep drivers, was slain by at least four gunmen who
barged into his suburban office. Police were uncertain whether the
killing was strike-related.
   Lazaro's union had not announced whether it will join the
general strike, which was planned to push for a pay increase of 38
pesos ($1.50 dollars) a day for all workers. His union refused to
join a transport strike two weeks ago.
   Leaders of the militant Labor Advisory Consultative Council and
the conservative Trade Union Congress of the Philippines called
Wednesday's strike.
   ``The workers have run out of patience, so we have decided to go
on with the strike,'' said council leader Fred Bentulan.
   On Sunday, assailants burned two buses in the suburbs of Makati
and Pasig after flagging them down and ordering passengers to get
off.
   The Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila wing of the Communist New
People's Army, said it carried out the attacks because the bus
owners were anti-labor and pressured drivers not to join previous
strikes.
   ``The ABB will mobilize all its forces and its wide networks of
mass support to ensure that the people's revolutionary spirit will
not be hindered by scabs and saboteurs,'' the rebels said in a
statement.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos ordered armed escorts to ride on
passenger buses. He told police to step up efforts to control
firearms and coordinate intelligence work.
   Last week, unions rejected a 17-peso (68-cent) per day increase
granted by the government to Manila-area workers. They said the
raise was an insult and would not cover increases in the prices of
fuel, food and utilities.

   The fax machine is making the wheels of
justice turn a little more smoothly these days in California.
   A two-year experiment approved this year by the Legislature lets
lawyers file lawsuits and probate and family law documents by
facsimile machine.
   Attorneys say it helps them beat deadlines as well as traffic in
car-clogged California, where papers usually are delivered by
messenger or by lawyers themselves.
   ``Like everybody else, we wait until the last minute and
sometimes things are developing until the last minute,'' said Delph
Wilson, a personal-injury lawyer in Los Angeles. ``You're in your
office pacing back and forth like a father in the maternity ward
while your secretary is pounding it out and you're hoping the
messenger gets there on time.''
   Smaller court clerks' offices around the state receive documents
directly on their own fax machines.
   In Los Angeles, the most clogged court system in the state with
more than 10,000 documents filed daily in Los Angeles County
Superior Court alone, the clerk's office is not equipped to receive
a flood of fax transmissions.
   Instead, Fax Court Filings Inc., a company formed by 30 attorney
service firms in the area, accepts fax transmissions of documents
to its office, then walks them over to the Los Angeles County
Courthouse nearby.
   Andrew Estin, president of Fax Court Filings Inc., said fax
filings have saved attorneys from missing the statutory deadline
for suing. In one case, he said, a lawyer faxed a petition for a
stay of execution.
   ``The realities of filing documents in metropolitan areas of
California are traffic and parking,'' he said. ``It's often
difficult to get a document to the court by the filing deadline.''
   Fax filings must meet specific requirements, including the type
of paper used. Fax Court Filings Inc. receives the documents on 20
sophisticated laser printing fax machines using bond paper instead
of the slippery thermal stuff.
   The filing of certain documents such as wills and codicils by
fax is prohibited. Otherwise, signatures on faxed documents
generally are acceptable.
   At the end of the experiment, the Legislature will decide
whether to make the program permanent.
   Minnesota was the first to try fax machines in such a way, in
October 1987. After a yearlong experiment, machines were ordered
installed in all state courts.
   Other states that have fax transmission in at least some courts
include Colorado, Idaho, Florida, Nevada, New York, Oregon and
Washington.
   Tony Nevarez, former lobbyist for the California State Bar, said
faxing was seen as a way to save clients and lawyers money by
eliminating messengers. He said the only opposition came from
process servers who feared losing business.
   Frank Zolin, Los Angeles County clerk and executive officer of
the Superior Court, said services such as Estin's are working well
but that less than 1 percent of documents are being filed by fax.
   ``People are slow to adapt to change,'' said Zolin. ``I see it
as a real convenience. But it's not a revolutionary change. I's
mainly a convenience to the litigants and attorneys.''
   In some cases, Zolin said, judges and lawyers will continue to
demand original documents. But he said the fax is a boon for
out-of-state firms.
   Estin, whose service was launched in June, said business has
been slow, but ``in five years everybody's going to be doing it.''

<TEXT>
   Kenya today broke diplomatic relations
with Norway, claiming it was helping to undermine President Daniel
arap Moi's government.
   Foreign Minister Wilson Ndolo Ayah said Norwegian diplomats have
a week to leave the East African nation.
   ``Recent events have demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt
that the government of Norway has been an accessory to illegal
activities by those Kenyan fugitives bent on undermining the
stability of the country and its constitutionally elected
government,'' Ayah told reporters.
   The Foreign Affairs Ministry in Norway denied the accusations.
``The government dismisses all allegations of it interfering in
Kenya's internal affairs,'' the ministry statement said.
   Ambassador Neils Dahl of Norway said 150 diplomats and aid
workers were affected by the expulsion order. He delined further
comment.
   Norway has provided Kenya with development aid for 25 years.
   In Oslo, Development Aid Minister Rom Vraalsen said the aid
would end when the Norwegian diplomats leave. He said there are
about 120 aid workers in the former British colony.
   On Oct. 8, police arrested Koigi wa Wamwere, a former legislator
and one-time political detainee who had sought political asylum in
Norway in 1986. Police said Wamwere was caught with machine guns
and grenades after secretly re-entering Kenya.
   During the weekend, Moi told a public rally the Norwegian
government backed Wamere's plans to overthrow his government. ``I
suppose what he was planning was at the behest of the Norwegian
government,'' Moi said.
   Tore Linne Eriksen, chairman of a recently formed Wamwere
Support Group in Oslo, said Norway exerted little pressure on Kenya
in Wamwere's case and the ``decision to break off diplomatic
relations with Norway shows how desperate the Moi regime is.''
   Wamwere nd three other Kenyans were arraigned on treason
charges Friday and ordered held until another court appearance Nov.
2. Treason is punishable by death in Kenya.
   Relations between the two countries long have been strained
because of Norway's criticism of Kenya's human rights record.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says Israel is
``doing all it can'' to bring thousands of Ethiopian Jews to
Israel, an aide said today.
   Shamir responded to a protest by 500 Ethiopian immigrants who
gathered outside his office Sunday and shouted, ``We don't want a
second Holocaust.''
   Israeli officials estimate 22,000 Jews remain in Ethiopia. Most
are stranded in the capital of Addis Ababa after gathering there
from outlying villages to await passage to Israel.
   About 17,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel. About half came to
Israel during a secret rescue mission in 1984-85.
   Shamir told demonstrators ``Israel is doing all it can for their
brothers in Ethiopia. We are in contact with the Ethiopian
government to allow greater emigration,'' Shamir's senior adviser,
Avi Pazner, said in a statement.
   Pazner said Shamir also promised to send three Israeli doctors
to Addis Ababa and to try to improve conditions for Jewish refugees
there. Many are suffering from disease and food shortages.
   Ethiopian Jewish activists in Israel say some 250 Jews have died
of disease and malnutrition since their exodus came to a halt
without explanation in July. Before then, 500 Ethiopian Jews had
left monthly for Israel under an agreement reached when Israel and
Ethiopia re-established ties in October 1989.
   The quasi-governmental Jewish Agency that deals with immigration
had estimated up to 18,000 Jews remained in Ethiopia. But agency
spokesman Gad Ben Ari revised the figure today to 22,000.

   President Saddam Hussein has agreed to
release some sick and elderly Americans held in Iraq, the leader of
the American-Iraqi Association said today.
   ``There is a definite commitment by the Iraqi leadership that
some Americans will be released,'' said Salim Mansour, who is
leading a delegation that met with Saddam on Sunday night.
   ``I would call the meeting very constructive,'' he said. ``We
don't want to talk about figures or names at the moment, but I'm
happy to announce that some good news will come up.''
   It was presumed Mansour was talking about Americans held in Iraq
and Kuwait, which Saddam annexed after his Aug. 2 invasion of the
emirate. Saddam considers Kuwait Iraq's 19th province.
   About 700 Americans are being held in Kuwait, and more than 300
in Iraq, many at strategic sites to deter a possible attack by the
U.S.-led multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian
Gulf.
   Before the invasion, about 3,500 Americans were living in Iraq
and its oil-rich neighbor. Saddam has allowed women and children to
leave, and some men have managed to escape overland to Jordan and
Saudi Arabia. Iraq also has allowed American men of Arab descent to
leave on commercial flights.
   Western diplomatic sources said on condition of anonymity that
they had no independent confirmation of Mansour's claim, ``but we
understand that what Mansour is saying could turn out to be true.''
   The diplomatic sources said they understood the Americans to be
released ``were all sick and elderly Americans.'' The diplomats
said between 47 and 57 Americans were in that category.

<TEXT>
   The KGB and Interior Ministry today announced a
crackdown on black marketeers and lawmakers voted for a new law
against ``speculation,'' stepping up an official Soviet assault on
the shadow economy.
   The actions follow two presidential decrees aimed at breaking
the black market's hold on many state supplies and a reform plan
designed to transform the centrally planned economy into a partial
market system.
   ``For the transition, we want to try to put more order in our
economy,'' KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov said at a news conference
with other officials.
   Interior Ministry chief Vadim Bakatin agreed but said the
targets of the crackdown might someday pull the country from its
economic morass. ``I believe the shadow economy will be supplanted
by law and commodity relations. But it's clear that we will have to
(get through) a transition,'' he said.
   ``We will have to have intermediate legislation for this period
to support the economy, while we hold criminal tendencies in
check,'' he said. ``Stealing and embezzling should not have a place
in the new economy.''
   Across town at the Kremlin, the Supreme Soviet legislature gave
preliminary approval to a bill to ``toughen responsibility for
wrongdoing in trading and for speculation and black marketeering,''
Tass said.
   The bill, which will undergo further debate, defined speculation
as ``the purchase of goods from state trading outlets and consumer
cooperatives and their resale for profit.'' It makes the activity
punishable by up to three years in jail and confiscation of
property, or ``corrective labor'' for up to two years and a fine.
Higher penalties would be imposed for severe crimes.
   Kryuchkov and Bakatin were vague about what kinds of activity
would be prosecuted. Activities ranging from purchase of hard
currency to reselling of state-produced goods now are outlawed.
   Officials said only crimes that harmed citizens would be
prosecuted, but it remained unclear how those activities would be
defined.
   ``If somebody goes to a village to buy food, then sells it in a
market in Moscow, that would've have been punished under old laws,
but no longer,'' Justice Minister Veniamin Yakovlev told the news
conference.
   But it would be illegal ``if a person buys goods at a state
store for (subsidized) state prices, then goes around the corner
and sells those goods at a higher price. This is no service to the
people,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Arkansas' attorney general, accused of
wining and dining friends, family and political supporters on his
state-issued Visa card, says he's guilty of no more than sloppy
record-keeping.
   Jury selection began today in Pulaski County Circuit Court at
Steve Clark's trial on one charge of theft by deception, with his
attorney quizzing potential jurors on their attitude toward
politicians and lawyers.
   In February, the allegations forced Clark to give up his
candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor, improving
Gov. Bill Clinton's re-election chances.
   If convicted, Clark, 43, could get up to 20 years in jail and a
$15,000 fine.
   As the trial opened, Clark's attorney, Bill Bristow, told
potential jurors his client had two strikes against him.
   ``One of the problems I've got with this case is my client is a
lawyer,'' he said. ``Lots of people don't like lawyers. My client
is also a politician, and I've heard people say they don't care
much for politicians. The fact that my client is a lawyer and a
politician, does that create any problem?''
   A pool of 48 prospective jurors was called for questioning, with
jury selection expected to last two days.
   Two pool members were dismissed this morning because of their
association with Clark. One was excused because he works for a
utility on rate-setting cases in which Clark's office is also
involved, and the other had worked in political campaigns,
including Clark's past campaigns.
   Among those subpoenaed to testify at the trial are Rep. Tommy
Robinson, R-Ark., and Arkansas' chief justice. In addition,
defense's list of prospective witnesses includes Clinton and Lt.
Gov. Winston Bryant.
   Clark, attorney general since 1979, is accused of improperly
billing taxpayers at least $8,448.27 on his credit card for meals
56 times from 1986 to 1989. The amount included $2,012.38 for tips
and alcohol. State law prohibits the purchase of alcohol on state
expense accounts.
   He reported as business expenditures meals with people who say
they didn't eat with him or that it wasn't business. Some who ate
with him said they paid the tab.
   After the allegations arose, Clark reimbursed the state
$3,951.29. He blamed poor record-keeping and said records of the
meetings were reconstructed from notes, his calendar, receipts or
memory every two to three months.
   The attorney general, whose job includes giving state agencies
his interpretation of the constitution and laws, also said he, an
elected official, wasn't required to keep itemized records required
of other state employees.
   Prosecutor Chris Piazza says Clark entertained supporters on the
taxpayers' tab to generate campaign contributions that ended up in
his pocket.
   ``To support his lifestyle, he would wine and dine some of his
biggest contributors at the state's expense,'' Piazza said at a
hearing.
   Piazza has said Clark was in poor financial shape and that the
contributions were deposited in his personal account.
   The attorney general's salary is $26,500, among the lowest for
the office in the nation, as mandated by the Arkansas Constitution.
Clark also gets $1,250 a month in public relations money with no
itemized accounting required.
   He was charged July 11 and released on $2,500 bail after the
discrepancies were revealed by the Arkansas Gazette Jan. 28. Eight
days earlier, Clark announced his candidacy for governor.

   There are no couch potatoes in
Connie Post's furniture stores.
   Unless you consider that original sofa spud, Rip Van Winkle,
snoring away on a fluffy recliner. But you surely couldn't count a
wide-awake Little Red Riding Hood, who tiptoes through a bedroom
set into the clutches of the Big Bad Wolf.
   Around a typical Post store, neon lighting, Greek columns and
high-tech mannequins add to the fun.
   Post designs stores for the furniture industry the way some
people design sets for the theater.
   ``I knock the socks off customers when they walk in,'' she said.
``I feel like I'm playing a game of seduction. ... I'm creating a
desire that they want to buy new furniture more than to buy a new
car or go out of the country.''
   The Chicago Tribune called Post ``one of the most sought-after
furniture store designers in the country.'' She grabbed the
industry's attention three years ago after designing Jordan's
Furniture store in Avon, Mass.
   Jordan's customers are greeted near the door by larger-than-life
likenesses of store owners Barry and Eliot Tatelman in an antique
car. The real-life Tatelmans have video monitors and microphones in
their offices to make their likenesses move and talk to startled
shoppers.
   The fun continues with a gorilla at a dining room table, free
video games and a pool table in a store lounge.
   ``It's not a typical boring furniture store,'' Barry Tatelman
said.
   Post said clients are sometimes surprised that she's based in
West Virginia.
   ``They think everyone in West Virginia has one leg longer than
the other, drinks moonshine and lives in the coal fields,'' she
said. ``I think everyone in America failed geography.''

   The leader of Germany's Jewish community issued a

   Heinz Galinski, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, said the march ``overstepped ... the patience of

   Several hundred neo-Nazis paraded through the southeastern city

foreigners in Germany.
   Galinski urged German political leaders to reflect on their
responsibilities.
   Gerhart Baum, a former West German interior minister, wrned
that extra caution is needed in the area that used to be East
Germany to prevent the growth of neo-Nazi movements.
   ``The police must intervene if there is any glorification of
National Socialism (Nazis),'' Baum said in an interview with the

   Leonard Bernstein decided two weeks before he
died to use a $100,000 arts award he had won to further musical
education, the prize sponsor said Monday.
   Bernstein, who died Oct. 14, will be honored posthumously with a
Praemium Imperiale award on Tuesday in Tokyo. The other winners are
director Federico Fellini, architect James Stirling, sculptor
Arnaldo Pomodoro and painter Antoni Tapies.
   The maestro's prize money will be used to establish the
Bernstein Education Through the Arts Fund, said Hiroaki Shikanai,
chairman of The Japan Art Association's Praemium Imperiale
executive committee.
   ``The Bernstein Fund will be one of many lasting legacies left
behind by this towering figure of 20th century culture,'' Shikanai
said in a news release. ``We are touched profoundly by Mr.
Bernstein's generosity and his commitment to a significant role for
the arts in modern society.''

   Country music legend Dolly Parton
doesn't believe in formalities. It will be just fine if you call
her ``Dr. D.D.''
   Miss Parton received an honorary degree Sunday from
Carson-Newman College, and brought down the house when she called
herself ``Dr. D.D.,'' a reference to her married name, Dolly Dean,
as well as her bust size.
   ``I'm trying very hard to hide it underneath this robe at this
fine Baptist ceremony,'' she said.
   The college offered the degree because of Miss Parton's
``personal involvement in supporting education,'' said
Carson-Newman President J. Cordell Maddox.
   Miss Parton has established a foundation in her native Sevier
County to encourage children to stay in school.
   ``I didn't like school at all. I was in a big rush to get out in
the world,'' she said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - It's not the first time Mick Fleetwood has
had to say goodbye to valued band members, but he admits some
soul-searching will follow the departures of Stevie Nicks and
Christine McVie.
   ``I just don't think anyone has realized how sad it's really
going to be,'' Fleetwood said. ``It's like a countdown to a
fountain of tears that will only come the moment those last notes
are played.''
   Fleetwood Mac's current tour is scheduled to end Dec. 7, marking
the end of the two singers' formal association with the band.
   The two want less stress and more time to focus on their solo
careers and personal affairs, Fleetwood said. There is a chance
they will record an album with the group before leaving, but it's
not definite. McVie, the former wife of bassist John McVie, joined
Fleetwood Mac in 1970 and Nicks in 1975.
   The band's remaining members - Fleetwood, bassist John McVie and
guitarists Rick Vito and Billy Burnette - may continue as a
scaled-down Fleetwood Mac or take on new talent, Fleetwood said.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Kirstie Alley says that if ``Cheers'' hadn't
come along, Hollywood still might only think of her as the Vulcan
officer in ``Star Trek II.''
   ``Now they see me as funny,'' Alley says in this week's People
magazine.
   With comic film roles like ``Look Who's Talking'' and ``Sibling
Rivalry'' coming in, Alley says she might not renew her ``Cheers''
contract when it expires at the end of this season.
   ``I used to think that I was a television actress who dabbled in
movies,'' she said. ``Now I like to think of myself as a movie star
who also works on a TV series. ...
   ``I have a big ego.''

   STOW-ON-THE-WOLD, England (AP) - Magistrates on Monday banned
Princess Anne from driving for one month and fined her nearly $300
because she was caught speeding twice on the same road in one week.
   The 40-year-old daughter of Queen Elizabeth II admitted driving
77 mph on Aug. 2 and 90 mph on Aug. 9 on Fosse Way, near Stow, in
the scenic Cotswalds northwest of London. The speed limit is 60
mph.
   Her attorney, Michael Sullivan, said she wished to ``express her
regret for both offenses.'' The princess was not in court.
   Buckingham Palace had no comment on Anne's ban but said she is
entitled to use the royal family's fleet of chauffeur-driven cars.
   Earlier this month, Princess Diana was given a warning for
driving 55 mph in a 30 mph zone near Kensington Palace in central
London.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Author John Updike says he has little respect
for the film industry after ``Rabbit, Run'' flopped and ``Witches
of Eastwick'' received mixed reviews.
   But he's willing to give Hollywood another shot and thinks
``Rabbit, Run'' star James Caan deserves consideration if a film is
ever made of Updike's latest novel, ``Rabbit at Rest,'' the fourth
and final ``Rabbit'' book.
   ``He wasn't bad,'' Updike said in a recent interview with The
Associated Press. ``He was too short, but the face is right, kind
of a wistful, rabbity, face. Why not have James Caan? He's been
aging along with the rest of us.''
   Updike said he had lukewarm feelings about the adaptation of
``Witches of Eastwick,'' a 1987 film starring Jack Nicholson, Cher,
Michelle Pfeiffer and Susan Sarandon.
   ``It had some life and the women were fun to look at. Nicholson
gives it a good shot but you were aware he was trying to energize a
script that nobody quite understood,'' he said.

Denver and Natalie Cole.
   Ritenour, 38, proposed to Santos one evening in Paris under the
Eiffel Tower, said Bobbie Marcus, Ritenour's publicist. They
married Sunday.
   The two met when Ritenour was on tour in Brazil and dated for
three years.
   Santos, 34, is director of the Sociedade Cultural Arte Brazil, a
non-profit arts and music organization based in Sao Paolo and Los
Angeles.

   A township mayor who was one
of South Africa's longest-serving black leaders resigned, citing
dissatisfaction with the national government. He urged other blacks
to do the same.
   Tom Boya, who was mayor of the Daveyton township for 10 years,
quit unexpectedly Sunday during a rally at the township east of
Johannesburg. He also said he was resigning as head of the United
Municipalities of South Africa, an organization of local black
councils.
   Many township residents oppose the idea of local black councils,
saying blacks should work to end apartheid through non-governmental
organizations such as the African National Congress. Like many
black municipal leaders, Boya had been under pressure to resign.
   ``This was the wish of the people. They wished me to resign from
the local authority structure, and I've decided to do so,'' Boya
said. He accused the government of not meeting township needs.
   At the same rally, Boya's deputy mayor and two local councilors
also announced they were quitting.

   A group of armed white men
gathered outside a hospital where a black woman was admitted,
forcing officials to move the woman to a ward for Indians, a
newspaper said Monday.
   The Star said the incident occurred Thursday at Voortrekker
Hospital in the town of Potgietersrus, about 125 miles north of
Johannesburg in the northern Transvaal region.
   It is one of the most conservative areas of the country.
   The Star quoted a witness, who was not identified, as saying the
men were armed with pistols, batons and rifles. They claimed to be
members of the White Wolves, an ultra-conservative group that
opposes racial reform, and threatened to remove the woman from the
hospital.
   The government in May declared public hospitals open to all
races, but blacks in the Potgietersrus area are generally sent to
another hospital near Voortrekker.
   The black woman had been taken to Voortrekker for special
surgery, the newspaper said. It quoted an unidentified doctor as
saying the woman was moved to an Indian section of the hospital for
her safety.

   A judge on Monday threw out a petition
alleging that Prime Minister V.P. Singh was suffering from
``lunacy'' and urging him to undergo a mental exam.
   The complaint by O.P. Saxena, president of the Lawyers' Forum
for Civil Liberties, contended Singh ``is suffering from mental
disorder and his continuance in the office of prime minister is
injurious to the health of the nation,'' according to the United
News of India.
   It said his alleged ``lunacy and unsound mind'' were
demonstrated by contradictory policies and statements and by the
fact that his minority government depends on support from parties
on the extreme right and left.
   Saxena sought to call Singh's wife as a witness, citing news
reports that she had accused her husband in a 1952 court case of
suffering ``an acute attack of lunacy'' when he gave away family
property to the poor.
   District Court Judge Mohammad Shamim dismissed the complaint as
``frivolous.''

   Workers arguing over the election of a
union official hurled home-made bombs and stones at each other,
leaving 100 people injured, police said Monday.
   Police used tear gas and fired bullets into the air to break up
the melee Sunday at the Adamjee Jute Mills, 10 miles southeast of
Dhaka, the capital.
   The clash erupted when opposition-backed workers disputed the
election of a government-supported candidate as the bargaining
agent for the mill's trade unions.
   It was the fifth time the rival workers had clashed in the past
month. At least 300 people were injured in previous confrontations.
   Politics in many industries and student campuses are organized
along national lines. Admajee Jute Mills employs more than 100,000
workers, making it the largest industry in Bangladeshi.
   Recently, the opposition has intensified a campaign to seek
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's resignation and to hold
elections under a neutral interim government.

<TEXT>
   They may have a fancy title, but the folks
who met here over a banana split luncheon recently were just a
bunch of jerks. And proud of it.
   Of course, that's an old joke for the 20 or so members of the
National Advisory Council of the National Association of Soda
Jerks. And their business in Omaha was serious stuff. They want to
preserve America's past.
   More specifically, they want to preserve that part of America's
past that dispenses ice cream and sodas from behind counters in
drug stores.
   ``The organization is dedicated to the preservation of American
nostalgia,'' said its president and founder, Betty J. Davis,
between bites of her split.
   Ms. Davis conceive of the organization after helping organize a
series of annual soda jerk reunions at Omaha's Western Heritage
Museum. The event ended in 1988.
   Last July, she announced formation of the organization and began
a search for soda jerks and fountains. Since then, she said, she
has heard from 300 former soda jerks across the country, and the
organization has registered 50 soda fountains.
   It also has embarked on a nationwide search for the oldest
existing fountain, and plans to publish a list of soda fountains
along with the memories of former soda jerks in 1992.
   Gary Laughlin of George Jay Drug Co. in Shenandoah, Iowa, said
his fountain is 102 years old, ``but it isn't the oldest.''
   ``People will ask, `Do you care if I take a picture?' We see it
every day so I guess we don't realize that there aren't as many
around as there used to be,'' Laughlin said.
   Ms. Davis said her interest in soda fountains stems from her
parents.
   She said her mother was a soda jerk at Oard Drug Store in
Council Bluffs, where she was courted by her father, ``who said she
made the best malts in town.''
   Later, Ms. Davis said, her mother confessed her secret: ``She
always put an extra egg in his malt. That was my Victorian
mother.''

   Baseball fans turned out by the hundreds
despite a steady rain today as the World Series champion Cincinnati
Reds were given a hero's welcome for their upset sweep of the
Oakland Athletics.
   Hundreds of people carrying umbrellas crowded downtown sidewalks
and second-floor elevated walkways to cheer and throw confetti as
members of the team rode through downtown streets in open red
convertibles.
   The five-block parade ended in a noon rally at Fountain Square,
a traditional gathering spot for celebrations.
   On Sunday night, hundreds of fans screaming ``Sweep! Sweep!
Sweep!'' turned out to welcome the players upon their airport
arrival, capping a euphoric weekend of celebrating the four-game
rout.
   ``It's stirring. It's just overwhelming for all these people to
be out here at this hour of the night,'' Reds owner Marge Schott
said after emerging from the plane. ``They're great fans. I love
them.''
   Airport officials had tried to keep the timing of the arrival
quiet, but fans gathered behind a fence and shouted as the players
and coaches stepped off the plane.
   Jose Rijo, the pitcher who won the first and fourth games of the
Series, said, ``Next year, we've got to win it again. This is too
much fun.''
   Schott, who was met by her St. Bernard, Schottzie, in a Reds
cap, hugged and kissed Rijo, saying, ``He's my boy.''
   Reds catcher Joe Oliver appeared amazed by the TV camera lights
and cheering crowd as he emerged from the plane carrying his
sleeping 8-week-old son.
   Some 10,000 fans took to the streets minutes after the Reds won
the series with a 2-1 victory Saturday night. The fans cheered,
drank and honked car horns into the wee hours. Police reported a
few arrests for disorderly conduct.
   Mayor Charles Luken won a bet with Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson
requiring the losing team's mayor to wear the winning team's
baseball cap to the next City Council meeting.
   Wilson said he will pay off on the bet.
   ``Yes, I will,'' Wilson said. ``I want to congratulate Charlie.
His guys came to play. They wanted it and they went out and got
it.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Joe Brennan and Republican John
R. McKernan traded jobs four years ago when McKernan became
governor and Brennan headed for Congress.
   Now, Brennan wants his old job back and he's waging a one-issue
campaign in which he accuses McKernan of setting the state up for a
post-election budget crisis.
   Brennan has been trumpeting the doomsday theme so loudly that
McKernan describes him as ``Joey One Note.'' The governor has spent
much of the campaign answering Brennan's attacks.
   McKernan boasts that Maine has been ``spared the mess of
Massachusetts,'' where the booming economy that once was touted as
the ``Massachusetts miracle'' has gone sour.
   ``It's an awful quibbling campaign. ... It's a bore,'' said
Joseph Sewall, a Republican activist and former Maine Senate
president. ``It's a `you did, you didn't' kind of campaign.''
   Pollsters say the race is so close that the outcome could hinge
on the performance of independent candidate Andrew Adam, a
political newcomer who portrays himself as a tax- and
budget-chopping populist.
   Recent polls show Adam pulling less than 5 percent of the vote,
but that could make a difference. Brennan holds a small advantage,
with 46 percent support to McKernan's 39 percent in a survey with a
margin of error of 4 percentage points. McKernan was down 12
percentage points in September.
   ``This thing could come down to the wire,'' says Kenneth Hayes,
chairman of the political science department at the University of
Maine in Orono and a one-time Democratic congressional nominee.
   The economy remains the major issue.
   Last spring, McKernan approved a deficit-reduction package. The
Democratic Legislature had enacted across-the-board cuts in
spending and deferred numerous tax breaks.
   A tax-amnesty program aimed at encouraging delinquents to pay up
was launched and the state threw in with the Lotto America game to
raise money.
   But Brennan contends Maine will enter 1991 facing a $100
million-plus deficit and the ``biggest fiscal mess'' in the state's
history.
   He says McKernan's program is based on faulty assumptions. It
counts on a nearly 14-percent growth in revenues - nearly $190
million - the bulk of it materializing after the election, he says.
   ``There's just no indication that those things are going to grow
like that - none,'' Brennan said during a recent campaign swing
through McKernan country.
   ``Obviously, they want to try to camouflage it the best they
can,'' he said. ``They know this. No one knows any better than
them. They know those monies aren't going to come in.''
   McKernan denies there's any evidence of a looming budget crisis.
   ``I don't expect applause from Joe Brennan. ... But frankly, if
he were concerned about the people of the state, he would be
applauding,'' he says.
   McKernan notes that the state has gotten through so far without
tax increases. However, neither he nor Brennan has ruled out tax
increases in the next four years.
   Brennan, 55, succeeded McKernan in southern Maine's 1st
Congressional District in the 1986 election. He was barred by state
law from seeking a third consecutive term as governor.
   At the same time, McKernan, 42, succeeded Brennan as governor.
Last year, McKernan married Maine's other U.S. House member,
Republican Rep. Olympia J. Snowe.
   McKernan, aided by campaign appearances by President Bush and a
procession of Bush Cabinet members, has raised the most money -
$1.3 million through mid-September. Brennan, who has received
similar help from Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
accumulated $1.1 million.
   McKernan continues to try to change the focus of the campaign.
   He contends that as governor, Brennan filled high-level
government jobs with cronies and was excessively lenient and showed
favoritism to political friends in granting pardons and
commutations.
   ``I believe Joe Brennan when he says he has compassion,''
McKernan said. ``I've got compassion, too, but it's for the victims
of violent crimes.''
   Brennan dismisses the criticism as unfounded, singling out the
cronyism charge as ``baloney of the first order.''

   A moderate earthquake awoke a number of
residents in Southeast Alaska around midnight, but there were no
reports of damage or injuries, authorities said.
   The quake had a magnitude of 4.5 on the Richter scale, according
to a preliminary reading, said George Carte, a seismologist with
the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center.
   The temblor was recorded at 11:58 p.m. about 40 miles west of
Haines in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Carte said.
   ``It was felt pretty good and it woke up a few people,'' Carte
said. ``But it's a typical event for that area. Glacier Bay is a
place where we record a fair number of quakes.''
   The earthquake was too small to generate a tsunami threat, he
said.
   ``It was an attention-getter but it was nothing of any
consequence,'' Carte said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of magnitude 4 moderate damage and 5 considerable
damage if it strikes a populated area.

   The Resolution Trust Corp., faced with a
limited pool of outside talent to help clean up the savings and
loan mess, has bent its ethics rules to do business with some
companies.
   The RTC, the federal agency responsible for disposing of
hundreds of collapsed S&amp;Ls, is signing on about 1,000 new
contractors a week and could soon rival the Defense Department as a
lucrative source of government contracts.
   At the same time, there is a limited number of outside
companies, such as accounting firms, with the expertise the RTC
needs. Because the $500 billion savings and loan scandal is so
far-reaching, many of the companies with the know-how needed to
resolve it have been touched by it in some way.
   ``All of a sudden you find yourself with very few horses in the
corral that aren't lame in some way,'' said Caryl Austrian, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   Another worry for the RTC is the potential for fraud by outside
contractors. The agency said this summer that it planned to hire
special employees to watch for possible corruption as it sells S&amp;L
assets. But the 20 to 30 ``contractor cops'' and their boss haven't
been hired yet, said RTC spokeswoman Lezley Norris.
   The RTC has bent its rules by granting conflict-of-interest
waivers to 11 companies, from big accounting firms to mortgage
companies and real estate brokerages, documents examined by The
Associated Press show. Many of the companies are the objects of
lawsuits that the RTC and the FDIC inherited from seized banks and
S&amp;Ls.
   Seven more companies also have received waivers, but information
on them is not yet publicly available, Kate Spears, another RTC
spokeswoman, said Monday.
   In granting the waivers, regulators decided that the lawsuits
don't indicate a pattern of wrongdoing by the companies as a whole,
only by some individuals. But the waivers also impose certain
operating conditions on the companies designed to avoid future
conflicts.
   The waivers cleared the way for the RTC to award millions of
dollars in contracts to the companies, which are helping the agency
evaluate and sell assets of the failed thrifts it has taken over.
   The RTC's Contractors' Conflicts Committee has given waivers in
all the cases of that type it has considered, Ms. Norris said.
   Many of the companies receiving waivers are accounting firms.
The accounting industry has been rocked by a merger wave in recent
years that has reduced the number of big firms, which are often the
most qualified to do complex S&amp;L work.
   Some accounting giants are targets of direct government suits
alleging shoddy audit work for failed S&amp;Ls and banks. These
generally do not do contracting work for the RTC.
   But other big accountants, named in suits filed by S&amp;Ls and
inherited by the government when it took over the thrifts, have
been allowed to do business with the RTC through the waivers. Three
- Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Grant Thornton and Laventhol &amp; Horwath -
received waivers from the Contractors' Conflicts Committee in June
and July.
   In an effort to avoid future conflicts, the waivers require the
companies to screen out employees involved in the litigation and
prevent them from working on new RTC contracts.
   Those conditions can be time-consuming and costly for the
contractors, said Michael O'Neill, a partner in Coopers &amp; Lybrand's
Washington office.
   ``You have to know where everyone is and what they're doing,''
he said.
   Other companies receiving waivers from the RTC are Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc., the nation's second-largest commercial real estate
company; Kidder Peabody and Co., a major financial company; Verex
Mortgage Corp.; and Flusche, Van Bevern &amp; Kilgore.

   Congress may be talking about taxing

of a bottle of Dom Perignon rose champage and a $110 set of two
Baccarat crystal glasses for a combined $250.
   Today, it costs $230 just for the champagne.
   Producers attribute the champagne crisis in part to the fall of
the U.S. dollar, and in part to a too-successful marketing
campaign.
   ``Democratization can sometimes go too far,'' explained
Christian Bizot, chairman of the Bollinger champagne house.
   During the past decade, French champagne producers marketed
their product toward the masses. They did such a good job that
worldwide sales last year hit 250 million bottles, up 75 percent
since 1982.
   ``Our sales have gone up much too fast,'' said Jean-Michel
Ducellier, president of the Ayala champagne house and chairman of
the Association of Champagne Producers. ``We have kept our prices
too low.''
   People who now pay $24 for a bottom-of-the-line bottle of Moet &amp;
Chandon, Taittinger or Bollinger soon may have to spend $30 or more
for a bottle. And the top-of-the-line bottles are expected to go
from $80 to about $100 a bottle by the end of the year.
   Patrick Poupart, the wine consultant at Hampton Liquors in Palm
Beach, said the higher prices will drive many champagne buyers to
sparkling wines from California and Spain.
   Still, De Fendi said it's bound to affect the lower end of the
market more than the higher end.
   ``The people who buy Moet for $20 or $30 a bottle complain when
it goes up a dollar,'' he said. ``But the people who buy Dom
(Perignon) won't care. If it was $200 a bottle, they'd just say,
`Fine,' and throw their credit card on the counter.''

   Government troops on Monday raided one of
several monasteries they are surrounding in the central city of
Mandalay and detained some of those inside, state radio reported.
   Monks, who have been at the forefront of anti-government
protests, had been refusing to minister to soldiers.
   But on Sunday, reports reaching the capital, Rangoon, sid the
monks had given up their boycott after troops ringed at least six
monasteries. Defiant monks also were threatened with the death
penalty.
   Official Rangoon Radio said troops raided Mandalay's Phayagyi
Monastery Monday morning and searched 139 of its buildings.
   Some people were detained and action would be taken against
them, the radio said. It did not say how many were detained or if
any of them were monks.
   The radio said the search would be extended to 11 other
monasteries in the city that were surrounded by troops.
   Mandalay is Burma's second-largest city and its religious
center.
   Buddhist monks in Mandalay and other Burmese cities began a
boycott of the army after soldiers put down a pro-democracy
demonstration there on Aug. 8, reportedly killing four people,
including two monks.
   Government television showed footage of the monastery search and
displayed pamphlets, duplicating machines, political badges, rubber
stamps and other items allegedly seized during the raid.
   The troops also seized sling shots and other weapons, the radio
report said.
   The pamphlets included publications of the outlawed Burma
Communist Party, the radio said. The military government has
persistently accused pro-democracy forces of links to the virtually
defunct party.
   The government had set a midnight Saturday deadline for
``illegal'' monks organizations to end their ban on performing
religious ceremonies for soldiers. On Sunday, it empowered army
commanders to try monks involved in politics under martial law
tribunals.
   Sentences dispensed by such tribunals range from a minimum of
three years in prison to a maximum of death.
   According to Rangoon Radio, 29 monks in Mandalay and nearly 200
in Rangoon formally declared they were ending their boycott.
   The monk's campaign is an potentially explosive problem for the
government, which has refused to acknowledge the May national
elections in which Burmese voted overwhelmingly for the opposition
National League for Democracy.
   Monks emerged at forefront of Burma's democracy movement in
1988. Millions of people took to the streets demanding an end to
more than a quarter of a century of military backed
authoritarianism. The army crushed the movement last year, killing
thousands of people.
   Troops began surrounding monasteries in Mandalay Saturday
morning. Details of developments in the city were scant beyond
official radio reports.
   The monks' boycott began in Mandalay on Sept. 6. It quickly
spread to other areas, including Rangoon, 350 miles to the south.
   About 85 percent of Burma's 40 million people are Buddhist and
some 300,000 monks live in monasteries around the country.
   In Buddhist societies, monks are regarded as spiritual leaders
of the community and also play a key role in popular celebrations
and various rites.

   A young lawyer says threatening phone
calls and a dousing with beer at her alma mater helped her land the
perfect job at an Iowa law school.
   And now her 11-year legal battle against Princeton University,
set off by that beer dousing when she tried to join one of the
school's all-male eating clubs, might bring her a chance to argue
before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``This could have an effect on fraternities and sororities
across the country,'' said Sally B. Frank.
   It's already made a mark on Frank, 31, who this semester became
an assistant law professor at Drake University.
   Her lawsuit against Princeton gave her a reputation as a
troublemaker by the time she got her law degree from New York
University in 1983.
   ``I did have trouble getting a job,'' she said.
   She finally landed one as law clerk for a New York civil court
judge and later taught a landlord-tenant clinic at Antioch Law
School in Washington and a discrimination clinic at New York Law
School.
   The assistant professor post in Drake's Law School is focused on
running its legal clinic, supervising law students handling cases
of poor neighborhood residents and university students and staff.
   Frank said she thinks Drake considered her background - and the
Princeton case - before hiring her.
   ``I think it showed an ability to take on a difficult and
unusual and complex piece of litigation and to work it through, and
they were interested in that for the clinic,'' Frank said. ``They
knew pretty much what they were getting and I haven't felt them
unhappy with what they got.''
   Frank took on Princeton and its three remaining all-male eating
clubs when she was a junior.
   The clubs, which Frank said provide a ``dining and social
function'' similar to fraternities, arose after the university
banned fraternities in 1856 and then lost its dining hall in a
fire.
   ``The clubs allow women at everything. They just want to keep
them in a second-class status by not allowing them to be members,''
Frank said of the Tiger Inn, Cottage Club - F. Scott Fitzgerald's
club - and the Ivy Club, the school's oldest and most prestigious.
   Frank wanted to join one about a dozen years ago. ``I went to an
event at their club for people planning to join,'' she said. ``One
member poured beer on me and 20 to 30 members started chanting,
`Let's throw Sally Frank in the fountains!' ''
   Then she got obscene and threatening telephone calls.
   ``They denied me membership, but more importantly, I felt that
they were having a negative effect on campus by increasing sexism
at the university.''
   She sued the clubs and the university in February 1979.
   She and a co-counsel from the New Jersey American Civil
Liberties Union argued that the clubs were public groups affiliated
with Princeton and that their male-only policy violated New
Jersey's law against discrimination. The clubs' lawyers argued they
were private groups free to bar anyone they wanted under their
federal right to freedom of association.
   On July 3, the ew Jersey Supreme Court ordered the clubs to
admit women and to pay Frank $5,000 in damages.
   The Ivy Club admitted 15 women at the beginning of this month.
The Cottage Club admitted women in 1986, when it and Princeton
settled with Frank.
   But Tiger Inn's members voted Oct. 9 to retain their ban on
women - shortly after their lawyer, Russel H. Beatie Jr.,
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.
   ``This is not an issue involving 125 overprivileged kids in a
rich-kid's school in New Jersey,'' Beatie said. ``This is an issue
affecting 7,000 fraternities and sororities with a membership
totaling roughly 9 million,'' as well as social organizations of
all kinds.''
   Frank isn't intimidated by the appeal. She notes that the high
court has ruled on the issue three times since 1974, ordering the
Jaycees, Rotary Clubs and elite New York social clubs to admit
women.
   And besides, she said, ``I think every lawyer always has the
dream of arguing a case before the Supreme Court. It's kind of the
ultimate.''

   Eric Kunkel wrote one of the weekend's most
engaging advertisements, but he nearly missed his target audience -
his bride-to-be.
   Kunkel, a Tulsa accountant, proposed marriage to Suzette Brewer
through a small ad in Sunday's editions of the Tulsa World. Trouble
was, Ms. Brewer nearly missed it.
   The ad read: ``Suzette, I love you. Will you marry me? Eric.''
   Ms. Brewer said she didn't initially see the ad, deep on Page 3
of the paper's Living section. But Kunkel, acting ``real cool,''
pointed it out.
   She said ``yes.''
   Ms. Brewer said she was shocked initially, then laughed ``for
two minutes. I was pretty red in the face.''
   ``Eric is a pretty creative person,'' she added.
   Kunkel had predicted success in advance.
   ``I'm 99 percent sure it will work,'' he had said Friday. ``But
I'm not taking anything for granted.''

   Rear Admiral Sigmund R. Petersen will become
head of the NOAA Corps, the nation's smallest uniformed service, on
Tuesday.
   Petersen, a native of Haugesund, Norway, who emigrated to this
country with his parents in 1948, succeeds Rear Admiral Francis D.
Moran.
   The NOAA Corps, a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, includes about 400 officers who operate 23 research
vessels and several hurricane hunting aircraft and who conduct
atmospheric and oceanic research.
   The corps was founded in 1917 as the U.S. Coast and Geodetic
Survey, taking its current name in 1970. During wartime the corps
comes under military command.
   Petersen joined the corps in 1961 after graduation from
Washington State University. Most recently he served as director of
NOAA's Pacific Marine Center in Seattle.

   Gov. George Mickelson said Monday he was
saddened by the weekend rampage of a crowd that did $40,000 worth
damage during the South Dakota State University homecoming.
   More than 50 people were arrested, and four faced felony charges
in connection with overturning a car belonging to Sioux Falls
station KSFY-TV.
   ``I'm very disappointed that what I know of now to be a small
group of perpetrators and a large group of onlookers did as much
damage,'' Mickelson said.
   An estimated $30,000 damage was done at SDSU, and off-campus
damage may total $10,000, officials said.
   The damage occurred Friday night and Saturday night during the
Hobo Day homecoming weekend at the 7,000-student, state-supported
school.
   Several hundred people marched across campus toward downtown
Saturday, tearing down signs and light poles. Three fires were
started near the campus, and some students pelted authorities with
eggs and beer bottles when they responded to the fires.
   Two people suffered minor injuries.

   The Democratic candidate for state treasurer
says his Republican opponent isn't emotionally or physically fit
for the job after being seriously injured in a September plane
crash that killed his wife.
   Bob Seale was hospitalized for more than a month after the Labor
Day crash during a campaign swing.
   He was flying the plane when it crashed, killing his wife, Judy,
and injuring three others, including state Sen. Sue Wagner, the
Republican candidate for lieutenant governor.
   The day after the crash, Seale defeated incumbent Treasurer Ken
Santor in the primary by a margin of 60 percent to 32 percent.
   Seale, 49, had been active for years in the state Republican
Party, but wasn't widely known until the crash.
   Democrat Ray Shaffer, 57, has urged Seale to withdraw from the
race until he's able to prove his mental and physical fitness to
tackle the job of handling the state's investment portfolio.
Shaffer also contends Seale's judgment woud be impaired because of
pain medication.
   ``Mr. Seale unfortunately must still be suffering from
considerable pain,'' Shaffer said. ``Just to take the pain
suppressants has to hamper the judgment of the individual.''
   However, aide Brian Krolicki said Seale was taking no pain
medication.
   Seale was hospitalized until Oct. 11 with burns and broken
bones. He officially returned to the campaign trail Oct. 16,
despite metal pins keeping the bones of his left forearm in place.
His other limbs were either bandaged or in a removable cast.
   Seale's cast and metal pins were expected to be removed soon,
and he's beginning to get around on crutches, an aide said.
   ``The loss of my wife of course is a tragedy and something that
has hit me very hard,'' Seale said. But, he said, she would have
wanted him to continue the race.
   Shaffer, a state senator who works as the North Las Vegas
building director when the Legislature isn't in session, also has
questioned Seale's qualifications for the post.
   Seale, a managing partner of Pangborn &amp; Co., has 20 years
accounting experience and has given investment advice to clients.
   ``I'm sure he's made out a lot of income tax returns for people,
but that doesn't make him an investment expert,'' Shaffer said.
   Shaffer said he would solicit advice from outside companies to
recommend a investment strategy.
   ``Once an investment policy is in place, it is very easy to
follow,'' he said.

   Law schools should require students to donate
their services to people who can't afford legal representation, a
group of law students said Monday.
   ``We find that it is really outrageous that people can go
through three years of law school and never be exposed to the legal
problems of someone who can't afford a lawyer,'' said Harvard law
student Steve Donzinger, a member of Law Students for Pro Bono.
   ``We are asking our educators to say ... these problems are
important enough to incorporate into our education,'' he said at a
news conference here.
   The group wants each of the nation's 175 accredited law schools
to incorporate a pro bono requirement into their traditional
courses of legal study by 2000. Lawyers and other professional
don't charge for pro bono services.
   Donzinger said fewer than one in six lawyers or law students
performs any pro bono work, even though American Bar Association
guidelines say its members should perform 50 hours of such work
annually.
   As many as 1 million people could receive needed legal services
if each of the nation's 129,000 law students performed 100 hours of
pro bono work a year, Donzinger said.
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who spoke on behalf of the
students' efforts, said the legal profession was becoming too
profit-oriented.
   ``It's not just the poor who are being deprived,'' he said.
``The law is a very noble institution that has been ennobled by its
practitioners. The practice of law is not just for commercial gain,
it's for the advancement of justice.''
   Pro bono requirements have been adopted by Tulane University and
Florida State University, Nader said, adding that several other law
schools - including Hawaii, Harvard and UCLA - are considering such
programs.

   With their pockets full of Iraqi dinars, hundreds
of Iraqi visitors have descended on Kuwait, buying everything they
can.
   A group of Baghdad-based journalists went to Kuwait over the
weekend on a trip arranged by the government to discredit Western
media reports that Iraqi soldiers were plundering the occupied
emirate.
   During the visit, it appeared that Kuwait, a thriving business
center before the Aug. 2 invasion, is slowly but steadily becoming
more and more Iraqi.
   Saddam's photographs are everywhere, just as in Iraq. More and
more vehicles are displaying Iraqi license plates, and there are no
signs of Kuwaiti armed resistance.
   ``I feel here like at home,'' said Kamal Abbas, a visiting Iraqi
businessman. ``There are no visas, no border checkpoints and no
need for re-export license.
   ``I buy anything and everything,'' he said, referring to the
supply of consumer goods that surpasses what he can find at home.
   Bashar Mubarak, a Kuwaiti businessman selling household goods in
the city's Nigras district, was asked what he thought about the
presence of his Iraqi counterpart.
   ``Who cares,'' he replied. ``Money is not an important thing
right now.''
   Iraqi officials strongly deny reports that there may be a chance
for a compromise solution of the Persian Gulf crisis. They say they
will never give back any of Kuwait.
   ``After decades, Kuwait has become what it should be - part of
Iraq,'' said Shihab Ahmed al-Jassim, the new head of Kuwait's
education department.
   Out of 500 schools, at least 108 are open, said al-Jassim, who
formerly was head of education in Basra, Iraq's second-largest
city.
   All the schools have photos of Saddam. The names of schools that
bore the names of family members of Kuwait's exiled rulers - the
al-Sabah family - are being changed, said al-Jassim.
   ``However, some Kuwaiti students are not attending school,'' he
said, explaining many Kuwaitis were out of the country when Iraq
``freed'' Kuwait.
   The schools are guarded by volunteers of Iraq's Popular Army,
which also guards all government buildings and nine checkpoints in
downtown Kuwait.
   During their 36-hour stay, the reporters did not hear any
gunshots.
   The Iraqi government imposes a curfew daily from 11 p.m. to 7
a.m., turning the once busy city into a ghost town.
   And even 12 weeks after the invasion, people are still fleeing
Kuwait - some because they lost their jobs or business, others
because they are unsure about the future.
   Immigrant workers are waiting to leave, but uncertain what will
happen to them.
   ``I have never been out of Kuwait since I came here. I do not
know where to go,'' said Mariana Niaeshai, a housekeeper at a
hospital who came here six years ago from the Philippines.

   The trial of two teen-agers charged with the
brutal rape and attempted murder of a jogger in Central Park was
disrupted just after it opened today when a defendant broke down
and screamed.
   ``No! No! No! I can't deal with this!'' cried defendant Kharey
Wise as four court officers ushered him out of the courtroom. ``I
can't take this! It isn't true!''
   His outburst, which led to an unsuccessful defense request for a
mistrial, came just after Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth
Lederer completed her opening statement. The trial is the second
stemming from last year's highly publicized atttack.
   Lederer said Wise, 18, and his co-defendant, Kevin Richardson,
16, would convict themselves through the statements they gave
police, statments the defense argues were obtained improperly.
   As Lederer was winding up her remarks, Wise talked to himself,
rocked in his seat and held his hands to his face as if he was
praying. He bit his lip and pounded his forehead with his fist.
   After she finished, the judge announced a brief break for the
jury before the defense's opening remarks. As the jury was filing
out, he began crying and yelling. He also vomited.
   Howard Diller, attorney for Richardson, asked the judge for a
mistrial because of the other defendant's outburst. But as the
trial resumed after a break, the judge denied the mistrial motion
and warned Wise to behave. Opening arguments for the defense then
proceeded.
   In her statement, Lederer told jurors that Wise and Richardson
were among 30 youths who went into Central Park the night of April
19, 1989, ``to beat, to rob, to assault, to attack anyone they
found in the park.''
   Defense lawyers claim incriminating statements made by Wise and
Richardson were coerced from mentally deficient boys. But Lederer
said statements from the two youths were ``freely and voluntarily
made,'' and are corroborated by other evidence in the case.
   The two are among six teens charged with the attack on the
jogger.
   The first trial ended in five-to-10-year sentences - the maximum
for juvenile offenders - for Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and
Antron McCray, all 16. They were convicted of rape, assault,
robbery and riot, but acquitted of attempted murder and sodomy.
   Wise, 16 at the time of the attacks, faces adult penalties that
could total up to 57 years in prison if he is convicted on all
counts. Richardson, 14 when he was arrested, faces the same five to
10 years as the three youths convicted in the first trial.
   Lederer told the jury that the defendants' guilt will be proved
by the testimony of bicyclists, joggers, police officers, medical
and scientific experts and by the defendants' own written and
videotaped statements.
   She said Richardson, in his videotaped statement, described how
he and the other teen-agers hid in the dark, behind trees, and
attacked the jogger when she ran past.
   She said Richardson describes how they ripped her shirt off, how
she screamed for help and how she scratched Richardson's face.
   Lederer said Wise made two videotaped statements because he
admittedly lied to police in the first one. She said he
acknowledged he had gone into the park with a group ``to do
violence.''
   In the second tape, he describes how he held her leg and fondled
it while others raped her.
   Defense attorney Colin Moore was rebuffed Friday when he asked
Justice Thomas Galligan to allow expert testimony that Wise is not
smart enough to have knowingly and meaningfully waived his Miranda
rights against self-incrimination. Moore said Wise has an
intelligence quotient of 73.
   Diller has said Richardson likewise is not intelligent enough to
have said the things police attributed to him in his statement.

   Before the doors of the jail slammed
shut behind him, Asif Ali Zardari was best known as the playboy
husband of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   But when Zardari was arrested and jailed Oct. 10 on charges of
kidnapping and extortion, he became a celebrity in his own right.
   In arresting the 38-year-old businessman, authorities accused
Zardari of kidnapping a Pakistani-born British citizen in April and
extorting $800,000 from him.
   Zardari vehemently denied the charges, saying they were
fabricated by an army-backed caretaker government bent on
destroying his wife's political career and her populist Pakistan
People's Party.
   This week, Zardari could well be elected to Parliament. Even Ms.
Bhutto's critics say her husband's popularity has grown since the
arrest.
   ``From the darkness of my cell, the light of democracy burns
bright,'' Zardari wrote in a plea for justice published in
Urdu-language newspapers.
   ``When I was arrested I felt proud. I joined the people who
broke the chains of oppression and fought for stability, human
rights and democracy,'' he wrote.
   Zardari is expected to remain in custody at least until Tuesday,
the eve of Pakistan's parliamentary elections.
   He still is a candidate for two seats in Wednesday's elections,
in the districts of Lyari and Nawabshah, his home town.
   The elections were called after Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old
government was sacked Aug. 6 on charges of rampant corruption,
nepotism and abuse of power.
   While her husband sat in jail, Ms. Bhutto led a mile-long
procession of brightly-colored trucks festooned with banners
through her husband's home constituency in southern Sindh Province.
   Ms. Bhutto pleaded her husband's case in an emotional speech to
tens of thousands of party loyalists who waited nearly 12 hours in
scorching desert heat for her.
   An employee of acting Prime Minister Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, a
Bhutto rival, said Zardari's popularity has grown since the arrest.
``That (the arrest) was the government's decision and it was a
mistake,'' said the employee on condition of anonymity.
   ``The arrest has become his badge of honor,'' said a foreign
diplomat, also insisting on anonymity.
   Lyari, a sprawling slum district in the provincial capital of
Karachi, was considered a good bet for Zardari before he was
jailed. Now it's believed to be a sure thing, even by political
opponents.
   Zardari was a favorite target of Ms. Bhutto's opponents during
her 20 months in power. They called him ``Mr. 10 Percent,'' a
reference to commissions he allegedly charged for lucrative
government contracts.
   ``Everybody believes he was the root cause of her downfall. But
if her hands were clean how could he get away with so much?'' asked
Jatoi during a campaign stop in his home constituency of New Jatoi,
a village neighboring Zardari's hometown of Nawabshah.
   But most Pakistanis now dismiss the the corruption issue as
irrelevant - a failed attempt by the caretaker Cabinet to portray
Ms. Bhutto's government as the most corrupt in Pakistan's 43-year
history.
   In the sun-baked streets of Nawabshah, a squalid village of
dried-mud huts surrounded by imposing 10-foot walls, people talk
about the election. Most people shrug off the charges.
   ``We've read about it, but we don't know. His family lives in
the same house in Nawabshah. We haven't seen any change. We don't
know,'' said a local resident, who refused to give his name.
   The fight in Nawabshah is expected to be tough and violent.
   ``People are keeping their vote in their heart,'' said a street
vendor who declined to give his name for fear of reprisal.
   Zardari is pitted against Jatoi's son, Murtaza, and most people
say the acting prime minister has pulled out all the stops for his
son.
   Mohammad Hashim, a local laborer, said several people had been
arrested in Nawabshah since Jatoi was appointed Ms. Bhutto's
successor, all of them workers for her Pakistan People's Party.
   While Zardari's family is native to Nawabshah, most residents
say their loyalty lies with his wife and her deposed father,
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown in a 1977 coup and hanged
two years later.
   Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is considered Pakistan's first populist
leader. Even his detractors say he dismantled the centuries-old
barriers between Pakistan's wealthy and and poor.
   ``In the past the poor person couldn't talk to a rich person,
but now he can grab anyone by the throat and make them listen. The
PPP has given us this courage,'' said another Nawabshah voter, who
refused to be identified.
   ``Bhutto did a lot for us and we'll vote for him, not Asif
(Zardari).''

   Saddam Hussein has agreed to release some sick and elderly
American captives, the leader of the Iraqi-American Foundation said
today. The Iraqi leader also asked his parliament to consider
letting all French hostages leave.
   American and Australian sailors, meanwhile, halted and boarded
an Iraqi freighter in the Gulf of Oman that over the weekend had
ignored warning shots and defied orders to return to Iraq, a U.S.
military spokesman said.
   The 5,200-ton Iraqi vessel was stopped as it sailed toward the
Arabian Sea. It had been shadowed during the night by U.S. and
Italian warships, sai Cmdr. J.D. Van Sickle, a Navy spokesman.
   The operation went smoothly with ``no shots fired, no resistance
met,'' Van Sickle said. He said ``the crew of the Iraqi ship is
cooperating.''
   The Pentagon later said the Iraqi vessel was allowed to proceed
on its way after it was found to be empty. The Pentagon said in a
statement that the ship had probably dumped overboard the cargo of
steel pipes and plywood that it was carrying to Yemen in violation
of the U.N. embargo.
   The head of the Iraqi-American Foundation, Salim Mansour, leads
a delegation that met with Saddam on Sunday night. He said today
that he received a commitment from the Iraqi leader to release
Americans.
   ``We don't want to talk about figures or names at the moment,
but I'm happy to announce that some good news will come up,''
Mansour said.
   It was presumed Mansour spoke about Americans held in Iraq and
Kuwait, which Saddam annexed after his Aug. 2 invasion of the
emirate. Saddam considers Kuwait Iraq's 19th province.
   About 700 Americans are being held in Kuwait, and more than 300
in Iraq, many at strategic sites to deter a possible attack by the
multinational forces arrayed against Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   Western diplomatic sources said on condition of anonymity they
had no independent confirmation of Mansour's claims, but added:
``We understand that what Masnour is saying could turn out to be
true.'' They said they understood that the Americans released would
by ``sick or elderly.''
   Also today, oil prices in New York were down $4.19 to $29.60 a
barrel as of 1:05 p.m. (EDT). In London, North Sea Brent Blend oil
fell $5.65 to $26.75.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, oil prices have fluctuated
wildly on world markets, reaching above $40 a barrel at times,
compared with pre-crisis levels of $22.
   Oil prices fell today on reports that Saudi Arabia's defense
minister, Prince Sultan, suggested Arab countries were willing to
grant Iraq ``all its rights.'' The market interpreted this as a
sign Saudi Arabia was prepared to agree to Kuwait ceding some land
to Iraq.
   Saddam, in a letter to the Iraqi parliament, said that
legislators should discuss freeing French nationals held in Iraq
and Kuwait. He said such a move would be a sign of Iraq's
friendship with France.
   There are more than 300 French citizens in Iraq and Kuwait.
   French leaders have favored linking a solution to the gulf
crisis with negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians over
the Israeli-occupied territories. Saddam has tried to make the same
linkage, and in a Japanese television interview broadcast today,
said the proposal deserved consideration.
   Saddam's request, reported by the official Iraqi News Agency,
did not say when the parliamentary discussion should take place.
   To enforce the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq, a multinational naval
force has been patrolling the gulf. It has searched numerous
commercial ships, and in a dozen cases warships have fired warning
shots to halt suspected transgressors.
   The latest incident began Saturday, when U.S. Navy and Coast
Guard inspectors boarded the Iraqi freighter Al-Bahar al-Arabi in
the Persian Gulf.
   The ship agreed to turn back to Iraq because its cargo of
plywood and steel pipes was prohibited under the sanctions, Navy
sources said.
   But the freighter continued to sail southward, despite the fact
that the O'Brien early Sunday fired three separate volleys of
warning shots from its deck and machine guns in an attempt to again
halt the vessel, the sources said.
   The O'Brien and the Italian frigate Libeccio shadowed the vessel
overnight.
   The boarding team today included 15 men from the Australian
missile frigate HMAS Aeelaide and 11 from the American frigate USS
Reasoner, Van Sickle said.
   The ship had been sailing southward toward the port of Aden in
Yemen, where there are strong sympathies for Saddam and his
struggle with the West.
   The Pentagon statement was issued on behalf of U.S. Central
Command, which is in charge of Operation Desert Shield.
   It said the Iraqi vessel was found to be no longer carrying
prohibited material and was allowed to proceed to her original
destination.
   Asked what had happened to the ship's cargo, the U.S. Central
Command said: ``We...can only assume it was dumped over the side by
the crew of the al-Bahar al-Arabi sometime between her first
boarding and today.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said the ship was leased by a private
fishing company and carrying fish from ``the Indian Ocean and
African ports.''

   Crude oil prices plummeted more than $4 a barrel
in heavy trading today on optimism about a peaceful solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Prices tumbled below $30 a barrel in New York - and even more,
to below $27, in London. The markets appeared to be reacting to
comments by Saudi Arabia's defense minister, Prince Sultan, who
suggested that Arab countries were willing to grant Iraq ``all its
rights.''
   ``The statement has really gotten the markets unsettled,'' said
Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E.D.F. &amp; Man International Inc.
``There is some expectation that maybe an Arab-proposed solution
... is in the cards.''
   By early afternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
contract for November delivery of light, sweet crude was off $4.19
at $29.60 a barrel.
   The decline comes on the heels of losses Friday, when the
November contract settled down $3.01 a barrel on the Mercantile
Exchange.
   In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for December delivery
closed at $26.75 a barrel, down $5.65 from $32.40 late Friday.
   Prices of refined products also fell sharply in New York.
   The contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline for November
delivery, which lost more than 5 cents on Friday, was trading at 77
cents a gallon on the Mercantile Exchange by early afternoon, down
a steep 10.91 cents.
   Home heating oil was down about 13 cents a gallon at 75.40 cents
after the near-term contract lost 8.11 cents on Friday.
   The market interpreted the Saudi official's comments as a sign
Saudi Arabia was prepared to agree to Kuwait ceding some land to
Iraq. Traders pushed prices lower on the belief that this
development might lead to a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis,
which began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Activity in London was fairly light as many traders stayed on
the sidelines waiting out the decline.
   ``We're just watching the prices go down,'' said a trader at a
major international trading house in London.
   But dealings in New York were hectic. ``It's extremely busy,''
one trader said. ``Prices opened lower, and then there was more
liquidation.''
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, oil prices have fluctuated
wildly on world markets, reaching above $40 a barrel at times,
compared with pre-crisis levels of $22 a barrel.
   North Sea Brent is a key European barometer of oil prices.
   In the United States, the price of a gallon of gasoline rose 2{
cents in the past two weeks, reaching a national average of $1.47,
according to a survey released Sunday.
   The biweekly Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gas stations indicated
prices have risen more than 40 cents a gallon since Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.

   Genetic parents who paid a surrogate
mother to bear their test-tube baby should raise the boy despite
the surrogate's claim that she wants the child after all, a judge
ruled today.
   Mark Calvert gently kissed his wife, Crispina, as Orange County
Superior Court Judge Richard Parslow rejected 29-year-old surrogate
mother Anna Johnson's claim seeking partial custody of the baby
boy.
   ``I believe he should be raised exclusively by the Calverts,''
Parslow said. The baby, whom the Calverts call Christopher, is now
4 weeks old.
   The judge said that a ``three-parent, two-natural-mom
situation'' would be confusing to the child and ``invites emotional
and financial extortion.''
   The Calverts, of Tustin, had agreed to pay Ms. Johnson $10,000
to bear their child, which was conceived through in vitro
fertilization using sperm and egg donated by the Calverts. Mrs.
Calvert can't carry a baby because she had a hysterectomy.
   Ms. Johnson wasn't in court for the ruling, but she had said
earlier that she would appeal an unfavorable decision.
   In the six-day hearing, her attorneys tried to show she and the
baby had developed an unexpected but deep emotional attachment
during the pregnancy that must not be severed.
   The Calverts had insisted that they should be recognized as the
sole parents. Parslow earlier granted the Calverts temporary
custody of the baby.
   Attorneys have said the Calvert-Johnson dispute could break new
legal ground because a genetically unrelated surrogate never has
sought custody. The famous Baby M case in New Jersey involved a
surrogate mother who was also the baby's genetic mother.
   Referring to the Calverts and the baby, the judge said, ``In
this case we have a family unit, all genetically related.''
   He said the argument by Ms. Johnson's lawyer that the baby has
three natural parents ``is really not in the best interest of the
child. ... I think the decision I'm making in this case is
definitely pro child.''
   Of Ms. Johnson, the judge said the Calverts ``entrusted her with
carrying their child.''
   The judge said Ms. Johnson appears to be articulate and
intelligent, so ``I don't think the Calverts conned Anna into this
agreement.''
   Ms. Johnson claimed that the Calverts neglected her during the
pregnancy and were late making payments.
   The Calverts offered evidence about the importance of the
genetic link. They also attempted to cast doubt on Ms. Johnson's
motives, claiming she was motivated by a thirst for publicity and
money, not love of the child.
   ``The only bonding Anna Johnson has is with your television
camera,'' Calvert told reporters after the ruling.
   Ms. Johnson, a single mother of a 3-year-old girl, and Mrs.
Calvert, 36, met while working as nurses at a Santa Ana hospital.

   Mimi Rogers sees a gleam of hope that women
may one day achieve equal status in today's macho movie world.
   ``It's an unfortunate fact that there are many more roles for
men than there are for women. A favorable sign is the success of
films like `Pretty Woman' and `Ghosts' - much more successful than
big, male-dominated action films,'' she said.
   ``With these two films, in which women are on more of an equal
level, being so successful, maybe the trend will start to shift in
the direction of having men and women really co-starring.''
   Upcoming movies seem promising: Cher and Winona Ryder co-star in
Orion's ``Mermaids,'' a sweet relationship movie; Michelle Pfeiffer
co-stars with Sean Connery in ``The Russia House,'' based on the
John le Carre thriller; Julia Roberts stars in next spring's
``Sleeping With the Enemy''; and Academy Award-winner Jody Foster
is eagerly awaited as the star of ``Silence of the Lambs,'' a taut
thriller based on the best seller by Thomas Harris.
   If not equal, Rogers has a vital role in ``Desperate Hours,''
with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. It's Dino De Laurentiis'
update of the 1955 movie, with Rogers in the part originated by
Martha Scott. Rourke plays the Humphrey Bogart role of a criminal
psycho who takes a suburban family hostage. Hopkins has the part of
the husband, originally played by Fredric March.
   The director of the MGM release is Michael Cimino. Yes, the same
Michael Cimino who won an Academy Award for ``The Deer Hunter'' in
1978, and made the financial bomb ``Heaven's Gate'' in 1980.
   Rogers remarked that during the ``Desperate Hours'' filming
Cimino ``was very relaxed, very much at ease and enjoying the whole
process. There was an awareness on his part that he wanted to bring
it in on time and on budget. I think we actually finished a week
early and under budget.
   ``He knows that he knows how to make movies. There's no question
the guy has made some brilliant movies. It's more a matter of
reaffirming that he can do it, that he can follow a schedule and a
budget, that it's no problem and boom - there's the movie. That's
what he did.''
   Rogers has three new films: ``Desperate Hours''; ``The Doors,''
Oliver Stone's biography of rocker Jim Morrison; and ``The
Rapture,'' an apocalyptic drama. Last January, she and Tom Cruise
ended their three-year marriage, during which she seemed to be
subordinating her own career as his zoomed skyward.
   She corrected that impression: ``I actually worked quite a bit.
Unfortunately, two of the films that I did haven't been released in
this country.
   ``I did a picture for Vestron called `Hider in the House' (with
Gary Busey) that got caught up in the company's bankruptcy. Then I
did a film with James Belushi called `To Forget Palermo.' We spent
14 weeks shooting that. It was an Italian-financed film - an
English (language) film with an Italian director. That's always a
bit of an experiment,'' she said.
   ``I don't know what happened to it. Maybe American distributors
looked at it and thought it wasn't going to make money. Both of
those films, I think, have been released internationally but not
here. So there's an apparent void that didn't really exist.''
   Like her former husband, Mimi (short for Miriam) Rogers had a
traveling childhood. Both their fathers were engineers who took
jobs all over. Rogers was born in Coral Gables, Fla., but she moved
to Virginia, Arizona, Michigan, England and finally Los Angeles. A
good student, she graduated from high school at 14, and started
acting in her 20s. Her first film was ``Blue Skies Again'' with
Harry Hamlin.
   Her other co-stars include Michael Keaton (``Gung Ho''),
Christopher Reeve (``Street Smart''), Tom Berenger (``Someone to
Watch Over Me'') and Denzel Washington (``The Mighty Quinn'').
   She usually plays ``the love interest.'' But she hopes that will
change as movies take a feminine tilt.

   He was known to Palestinians as
the ``living martyr,'' a youth who clung to life for more than two
years with a bullet wound suffered in a clash with Israeli troops.
   Mohammed Naim Abu Akar lost his long battle Monday, succumbing
to liver and respiratory failure, doctors at Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital said.
   Abu Akar, 18, had survived on intravenous feedings because his
intestines were all but destroyed by the bullet that hit him in a
clash in the Dheishe refugee camp near Bethlehem on Aug. 6, 1988.
An attempt at reconstructive surgery in Boston failed.
   Palestinians have been rebelling against Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip since December 1987, and more than
3,000 of them gathered for Abu Akar's funeral Monday in the village
of Irtas, south of Bethlehem.
   Mourners marched with scores of outlawed Palestinian flags and
heaped dozens of floral wreaths upon his coffin. In Bethlehem,
shops, offices and schools closed in mourning.
   Activists used loudspeakers to exhort the crowd: ``Anyone who
wants to mourn Mohammed should go out and attack the Zionists!''
   The army did not intervene.
   Earlier, when Abu Akar's death became known, the news sparked
stone-throwing. The army imposed a curfew on the Dheishe camp's
7,000 residents to restore order.
   Dr. Khaled Abu Iqraiah, who treated Abu Akar over the past two
years at Mukassed, said the youth would long be remembered.
   ``In the occupied territories, he stood as a symbol for the
victims of the uprising,'' Abu Iqraiah said. ``He was a dear
example for many Palestinians because he fought to survive for a
long time.''
   Abu Akar was wounded in August 1988 in a stone-throwing clash
with soldiers. It was one of dozens of confrontations he joined as
an activist with the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, friends said.
   The bullet tore into his abdomen, damaging both the large and
small intestines, Iqraiah said.
   He said friends and Palestinian human rights groups raised funds
to help pay for sending Abu Akar to Boston's New England Deaconess
Hospital in November and December 1988 for experimental surgery.
   When it failed, Abu Akar was brought back to Dheishe and kept
alive on intravenous feeding.
   He began to fail two days ago and was moved to Mukassed, where
he died in the intensive care unit, the doctor said.
   Palestinians call those killed by the Israelis ``shuhadaa,'' or
martyrs, and they now count Abu Akar as the 762nd such victim since
the Palestinian uprising began.
   ``With our souls, with our blood we will avenge your death,''
they chanted at his funeral.

<HEAD>Chefs and Nutritionists Unite To Concoct Healthy, Delicious Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CECI CONNOLLY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of nutritionists and chefs have joined
together to forge a ``new era'' of eating, to show people there are
ways to eat healthily and still enjoy good food.
   ``Welcome to the meeting of two formerly warring groups, the
taste community and the science community,'' chef Julia Child said
when the group met this weekend.
   Cholesterol warnings, mixed messages on caffeine, scares over
chemicals and the all-encompassing bad word ``fat'' have left many
fretting over what they eat.
   The conference, sponsored by the National Dairy Board and the
American Institute of Wine and Food, attempted to allay people's
fears and guilt about eating patterns.
   ``Fat is not a four-letter word,'' said Jan Weimer, a food
consultant and conference organizer. ``It has its place.''
   Dr. Carl Orringer, director of preventive cardiology at the
University of Michigan Medical Center, applauded the group's
efforts, but said that ultimately people need to recognize some
food is not good for them.
   The conference sponsors ``would obviously like to avoid
eliminating foods that they sponsor,'' he said. ``In reality, what
they're admitting is if it's better to eat less than more, then
maybe it's better to eat even less, to the point where maybe it's
better not to eat those foods at all.''
   Child noted that chefs traditionally have viewed dieticians and
nutritionists as ``the wicked stepmother,'' and the medical
community has been dubious about chefs.
   After months of negotiations and cooking, the group agreed on
some general statements embracing the importance of tasty, healthy
meals.
   Dr. C. Wayne Callaway said people should focus on what they eat
over longer periods, and regular, moderate exercise.
   ``We're teaching people how to eat, rather than what not to
eat,'' he said.
   The group plans to lobby fellow nutritionists and chefs and then
take their ideas to the public.
   Callaway believes peer pressure and changing market demands will
make restaurateurs, store owners and even fast food chains change
their ways.

<HEAD>Lab Study Finds Cocaine Prompts Growth of AIDS Virus</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine speeded the growth of the AIDS virus in
laboratory tests, prompting concern that it could increase infected
people's chances of developing the deadly disease, researchers
reported Monday.
   Microbiologists at the University of Minnesota Medical School
exposed cells that are the primary target for the AIDS virus to
doses of cocaine. The virus, HIV, was found to grow as much as
three times faster in the cocaine-laced tests than in control
studies.
   If what happened in the test tube happens in HIV-infected
cocaine users, it could increase their risk of developing AIDS,
said Dr. Ronald Schut, the lead researcher.
   ``In persons who are infected, if they continue to abuse this
drug it may have a significant impact on the development of
clinical AIDS,'' Schut said.
   While about 150,000 AIDS cases have been reported in the United
States, researchers say a million or more other Americans are
infected and at risk of developing AIDS.
   Test-tube tests, however, don't always mimic what happens in the
human body. The question now for researchers is whether drug use
somehow modifies the immune system to enhance HIV growth in humans.
   ``The initial in-vitro (test-tube) studies suggest that it's
possible,'' Schut said.
   Schut presented the findings at the Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, sponsored by the American
Society for Microbiology.
   Further studies are under way using immune cells from drug users
in a methadone program, where cocaine use is high, ``to see if the
virus grows easier,'' Schut said.
   Dr. James Curran, director of the Division of HIV-AIDS at the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control, said little if any solid
information is available concerning the AIDS risk of cocaine users.
He added that drug users are notoriously difficult to study and
many cocaine users are involved in injectable drug abuse, which can
spread HIV by dirty needles.
   Nearly one-fourth of the AIDS cases reported in this country
stem from intravenous drug use, according to the CDC.
   Curran said that while the Minnesota test results may be
correct, of greater concern is the practice of trading cocaine for
sex, leading to the spread of the AIDS virus by sexual contact.
   Still, as far as cocaine is concerned, Curran said, ``I think
it's safe to recommend don't do it.''
   Also at the microbiology conference Monday:
   - Curran predicted that homosexual men will still make up ``a
large proportion'' of AIDS cases five years from now, despite the
increase in AIDS among intravenous drug users and their sex
partners. Half of last year's AIDS cases in the United States
involved gay men, he said.
   - Dr. Douglas Richman, an AIDS specialist at the University of
California, San Diego, predicted that even without an AIDS vaccine,
combination drug treatments will enable infected people to live
``normal'' lives and approach normal lifespans.
   ``A patient with HIV will be treated similarly to a patient with
diabetes or hypertension - prevent the progression of disease and
maintain the quality of life,'' Richman said.
   Complications from high blood pressure and diabetes can be
controlled and reduced with drug treatment, and so will various
complications of HIV infection, he said.
   - Development of an AIDS vaccine is ``a concept that is
achievable,'' said Dr. Lawrence Corey, an AIDS specialist at the
University of Washington in Seattle. But ``cocktail'' vaccines,
combating various HIV strains, aren't at the human trial stage yet,
and the protection offered by some vaccines tested in animals has
tended so far to be quite short in duration, he said.
   Because of the risk involved in testing a whole-virus AIDS
vaccine, it's more likely that researchers will aim for development
of a ``sub-unit'' vaccine, utilizing only pieces of the AIDS virus,
he said.

   Japanese students at Teikyo Loretto Heights
University say they have been racially harassed.
   Twelve students reported some types of harassment, from racial
taunting to egg-throwing and people urinating in front of them. Two
incidents involved beatings and robberies of students.
   Earlier this year, a fake bomb was sent to the school with a
note reading, ``Japs go home,'' authorities said.
   The university was formed as a cooperative effort between Regis
College and Teikyo University in Tokyo. About 350 students, all
Japanese, began classes last April. The school is limited to
Japanese students, but hopes to expand to include U.S. students
next year.
   Despite recent incidents near the campus, many students say they
are not afraid because no one has been seriously injured.
   ``These incidents made students wake up to the fact that they
are living in the United States,'' said Takanori Matsui, 22.
``Students sometimes think they are living in Japan, which is a
very, very secure place.''

<HEAD>Republicans Criticize Delay in Senate Ethics Committee Ruling</HEAD>

   Republicans sharply criticized the Senate
Ethics Committee today for delaying a crucial ruling in the cases
of five senators who assisted former savings and loan executive
Charles H. Keating Jr.
   The Republicans demanded that the committee, headed by Sen.
Howell Heflin, D-Ala., act before adjournment this week on a
special counsel's recommendation that two senators be dropped from
the probe and three others remain subjets of an intensified
inquiry.
   Heflin defended the timetable, citing work conflicts by
senators.
   The criticism was led by Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the only
Republican among the five senators under investigation.
   McCain said the committee's ranking Republican, Warren Rudman,
R-N.H., had tried unsuccessfully to move the investigation along.
   ``There's far more at stake than my reputation. There's the
reputation of the United States Senate,'' McCain said.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. joined the criticism as
did Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. and John Danforth, R-Mo.
   The senators noted that Congress is less than a week from
adjournment, and six weeks have passed since committee special
counsel Robert S. Bennett recommended that McCain and Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, be dropped from the probe.
   Bennett proposed continuing the investigation against Democratic
Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan
and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona.
   Heflin said in a floor speech that there had been ``an organized
campaign of leaks'' that harmed three of the Democrats under
investigation.
   Documents before the committee, obtained by The Associated Press
and others, have shown that Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle had
closer relationships with Keating than they have publicly
acknowledged.
   ``It is interesting to note that the leak of documents has been
confined to three senators and that there has been no leak of
documents about the other two senators,'' Heflin said in a floor
speech.
   Heflin added that in addition to Bennett's recommendations, the
committee should study an Oct. 1 statement by Common Cause, urging
that no senator be dropped from the probe at this time.
   He added that the committee would meet Tuesday.
   Dole said there are rumors the committee doesn't want to make a
decision because of politics. ``It seems the failure to act would
lead to the same conclusion. It's not a partisan committee.
Judgments never have been considered in a partisan way on the
Senate floor. We want to keep it that way. Two of our colleagues
have sort of been hung up to dry,'' he said.
   The five senators intervened for Keating with banking regulators
and also received $1.3 million in political contributions from the
businessman and his associates.
   Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan was seized by the government
in April 1989. It may cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to cover
the losses.
   Common Cause, the congressional watchdog group, requested the
investigation a year ago, and the preliminary probe began last
December.

   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on
Monday ended her campaign for vindication in the polling booths
with a procession through Lahore, traditionally her opponents'
territory.
   Hundreds of riot police carrying semi-automatic weapons and
steel-cased batons lined the streets. Officials divided the city
into separate areas for cavalcades by Bhutto's Pakistan People's
Party and those of her opponent, Nawaz Sharif's Islamic Democratic
Alliance.
   Nearly 50,000 soldiers were deployed nationwide because of fears
of violence between Bhutto's and Sharif's supporters.
   In Lahore, the parade by the Islamic Democratric Alliance
strayed only briefly into territory earmarked for the Pakistan
People's Party, and no violence was reported.
   By law, campaigning stopped at midnight Monday for the
parliamentary elections Wednesday.
   The elections were called after Ms. Bhutto's government was
dismissed three years early Aug. 6 on charges of corruption and
nepotism.
   The elections pit the center-left Pakistan People's Party
against the Islamic Democratic Alliance, a coalition united by
supporters' contempt for Ms. Bhutto.
   The two groups, along with 30 other smaller parties and
independents, are vying for 217 seats in the National Asembly, the
law-making lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime
minister.
   Ms. Bhutto, whose father Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was deposed as
prime minister in 1977 and hanged two years later, has regularly
warned of likely vote-rigging by the caretaker government and the
president.
   The former prime minister's opponents have tried to portray her
as one of Pakistan's most corrupt and inept leaders.
   The 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto is being tried on six charges of
corruption and abuse of power before the special courts in Lahore
and her hometown, Karachi. She could be banned from politics for
seven years if convicted on any of the charges.
   Ms. Bhutto spent almost a decade in prison, under house arrest
or in exile after the overthrow and execution of her father. She
became the first woman to lead a modern Moslem nation in November
1988 in Pakistan's first free elections that ended 11 years of
military rule for the nation of 110 million people.
   Her 20 months in office were marked by confrontation that
paralayzed Parliament and alienated the army. Allegations of
corruption, which she denies, ultimately brought about her
downfall.

   Two thousand people packed a small Bronx church
and lined the streets around it Monday to mourn the death of a
10-year-old girl whose slaying has compounded the grief of a
crime-weary city.
   ``Those of us gathered here are the city weeping, the city in
tears,'' said Cardinal John J. O'Connor, who officiated at the
funeral Mass for Jessica Guzman. ``We are related by pain, by
suffering, by this common language of sorrow, the anguish we all
feel, every one of us.''
   Mayor David Dinkins and other city officials attended.
   Jessica, who would have turned 11 on Saturday, disappeared from
her home on Oct. 10. Her body was found Wednesday about five miles
away.
   The city medical examiner said she was killed by ``homicidal
asphyxiation,'' but the exact method could not be determined
because her body had begun decomposing. Police said there were no
wounds on her body.
   Police have reported no developments toward solving the killing,
one of many high-profile crimes that have plagued New York City
this year. Detectives have reopened the 5-month-old case of a
21-year-old woman because of similarities to Jessica's death.
   Detectives also are considering a possible link between
Jessica's death and that of two other Bronx children killed last
year.
   Hundreds of people squeezed onto the sidewalk across from St.
John Vianney Church while the Mass was held inside. Some held signs
in English and Spanish calling upon Gov. Mario Cuomo to reinstate
the death penalty. Other signs, some held by small children, said,
``Adios, Jessica'' or ``Jessica, We Are With You.''
   ``I'm a mother and a grandmother and I am scared,'' said Maria
Ramirez, who held a sign in Spanish calling for death to the
killer. ``Our children are our future. We need the death penalty or
we will destroy our future.''
   Jessica's mother, Milagros Guzman, barely able to walk and
supported by her husband, Wilfredo, and a family friend, clutched
her daughter's doll throughout the service, which was piped to
loudspeakers outside.
   Wilfredo Guzman clutched a wooden cross.
   O'Connor urged the family and those assembled to ``use this
suffering. It can make all of us compassionate. It can change this
city. It can completely revitalize this city. It can replace
violence with love and gentleness. It can replace crime with
tenderness. It can replace anger with peace.''

<HEAD>Missouri Supreme Court Strikes Ethics Amendment From Ballot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Missouri Supreme Court on Monday
threw an ethics amendment off the Nov. 6 ballot. Opponents argued
it was unconstitutional because it covered too many subjects.
   In a one-paragraph ruling, the court upheld a judge's decision
to take Amendment 5 off the ballot.
   The judges offered no immediate comment, saying they would issue
a written opinion later. Amendment backers could seek a rehearing,
but there apparently are no other routes for state appeals.
   Amendment 5 would create a state ethics commission. It also
would reduce the 163-member House to 103 members by 2003, shorten
legislative sessions, and appropriate money for ethics commission
operations ahead of other spending.
   Democrats contend the measure is an attempt by Republican Gov.
John Ashcroft, a major financial backer of Amendment 5, to reduce
legislative strength.
   ``No other governor in recent memory, Democrat or Republican,
has undertaken such a blatant campaign against the elected members
of the Senate and House under the guise of `ethics.' Luckily, the
Missouri Supreme Court has seen through his duplicity,'' said
Senate President Pro Tem James Mathewson, a Democrat.
   Ashcroft had no immediate comment.
   The court's decision - issued 15 days before the election - was
distributed to reporters within 90 minutes after it concluded a
hearing appealing Cole County Circuit Judge James McHenry's order.
   Attorney John Bardgett Sr., representing amendment opponents,
told the state's highest court that Amendment 5 unconstitutionally
deals with too many subjects. It placed voters in the confusing
position of voting for ethics while reducing their legislative
representation, he said.
   ``Do you think people ought to have to swallow one to get the
other?'' asked Bardgett, the court's former chief justice.

   The Office of Thrift Supervision said today it
will seek $30.8 million in restitution from David L. Paul, the
former chairman of the failed CenTrust Bank of Miami.
   OTS officials told a news conference it was the second-largest
amount they are seeking in a savings and loan case.
   They said Paul's ``insatiable vanity and greed'' were a major
factor in the failure of CenTrust, which will cost taxpayers an
estimated $1.7 billion.
   The thrift agency said it is serving Paul with an order
demanding restitution to CenTrust and barring him from selling or
transferring any assets of more than $5,000.
   The OTS also is seeking an order that would prohibit Paul from
working for any savings and loan.
   The regulators are seeking the return of $15 million from a
legal defense fund set up by CenTrust to pay legal fees in lawsuits
filed against Paul and other directors.
   The $30.8 million also includes $4.9 million from a special
retirement plan created mainly for Paul. The assets of the plan
were transferred out of the country and managed by Edward D.G.
Davies, a British financier and former director of CenTrust.
   The OTS officials said Paul will have until Nov. 1 to pay the
money or to post bond in that amount. However, they said, they do
not know his whereabouts.
   ``We believe he still has a residence in Miami, Florida,'' said
Faith Hochberg, a senior deputy chief counsel of OTS. She said the
order will be sent to that address.
   There is speculation that Paul is currently in Israel.
   If Paul does not answer the request, the regulators said they
will go to federal court in Miami to compel him to do so.
   The largest amount sought by federal regulators in an S&amp;L case
was $40 million, from Charles Keating, Jr.

   The World Health Organization said Monday that
tests on four continents show weekly hormone injections for men
could be a more effective birth control method than the pill.
   The agency said the technique used a hormone preparation,
testosterone enanthate, that is already in use for other purposes.
It halts sperm production.
   The WHO said the research involved 271 men, of whom 157 received
weekly injections of the hormone. Their partners stopped using any
other form of contraception for a year.
   ``There was only one pregnancy during 1,486 months of exposure,
an extremely high contraceptive efficacy, comparable to that of
female injectable contraceptives, better than that of oral
contraceptives and intrauterine devices, and substantially better
than that of condoms,'' the WHO said.
   The tests were conducted in seven countries - Australia, China,
Finland, France, Sweden, Britain and the United States.
   The WHO said there were ``few side effects directly attributable
to the hormone'' but did not elaborate.
   It said a number of volunteers withdrew from the project because
they found it impractical to get weekly injections.
   ``WHO's four-continent trial devised to examine a hormonal
antifertility technique in men has produced a major breakthrough,''
a WHO statement said.
   More practical ways of dispensing the hormone, perhaps requiring
only three injections a year, are being developed, WHO said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Congress are about to turn
economic wisdom on its head with a plan to raise taxes and slash
spending with the nation seemingly on the verge of a recession.
   Yet despite occasional jeers from supply-side disciples in
Congress, many economic experts say it's precisely the right thing
to do.
   ``Under normal conditions, you don't want to be cutting back on
government demand at the same time that private demand is dropping
in a recession because that gives a double whammy to the economy,''
said David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI-McGraw Hill Inc.
   ``But when things are this far out of kilter, the benefits of
solving the underlying structural problem outweigh the short-term
damage,'' he said.
   Economists are afraid rising government borrowing needs will
push U.S. interest rates higher and make it difficult for American
companies to finance the modernization needed to compete in a world
economy.
   The emerging budget deal in Congress would cut spending
throughout the government, raise income taxes on the wealthy and
increase the federal gasoline tax, all contrary to the traditional
economic theory that says spending should be increased and taxes
cut during slow times in the hope of stimulating the economy.
   Critics of the deal are warning it will turn George Bush into
Herbert Hoover, another Republican president who preached the need
for budgetary prudence as a response to an economic downturn.
   But a large number of private economists believe Congress and
the president are doing the right thing in putting together a
program to trim the federal deficit by $500 billion over the next
five years although they admit it goes against the economic gospel
as preached by John Maynard Keynes.
   Keynesian economics holds that the government through its
spending and taxing policies should stimulate the economy when it's
weak and restrain it when it's strong.
   Supporters of the deficit program make these arguments:
   While the combination of tax increases and spending cuts will
remove purchasing power from the economy at a critical time, the
Federal Reserve has promised to offset those adverse impacts by
lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity.
   In addition, the impact of the deficit-cutting package is
relatively small in the immediate future. It calls for a small down
payment of only $40 billion in deficit-cutting medicine in the
current fiscal year, at a time when the economy is expected to be
weakest.
   The really big tax and spending changes won't begin to bite
until later years, when the economy will supposedly be in better
shape because of the Fed's efforts to push interest rates lower.
   Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, whose arguments for tax
increases got him into hot water during his days as head of
President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, is one of many
economists supporting the deficit reduction package.
   ``To the extent that it is contractionary, it is fairly easy for
the Fed to offset that and the longer term results of the package
will be expansionary,'' Feldstein said.
   Many economists said they believed the $40 billion in deficit
cuts called for in the first year was about the right size - large
enough to be credible but not so large that it would too seriously
dampen a $5 trillion economy.
   However, there is debate on that point. Some analysts contend
that the recession they believe is imminent will be made worse by
the deficit package.
   ``The simple fact is that Congress and the administration waited
too long to get serious about deficit cutting,'' said David Jones,
chief economist of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer. ``I think it is incorrect to think that interest rates will
fall far enough to offset the negative effects of raising taxes and
cutting spending that are in the plan.''
   Jones said he believes a recession, the first one in eight
years, started in August and could last for up to 18 months.
   The trouble Bush has had selling the deficit-cutting package to
House Republicans reflects a belief among supply-side enthusiasts
that tax cuts, not tax increases, are what an ailing economy needs.
   ``The deficit cutters have a simplistic notion that if the
medicine doesn't taste good then just swallow hard and you will
feel better in the morning. I don't think that is true,'' said John
Makin, an economist with the conservative American Enterprise
Institute.
   But other economists argue that economic peril lies in
continuing to ignore the string of budget deficits. Next year's
deficit is expected to total nearly $300 billion without any
changes.
   They contend this legacy of debt has driven U.S. interest rates
higher, increased the country's dependency on foreign capital and
curtailed the critical investments America needs to boost
productivity.
   ``We need more deficit reduction, not less,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. ``It is not so much for us but
for our kids and their potential standard of living that this is so
important.''

   For $6 and a pack of cigarettes, Saddam Hussein's troops looked
the other way as Ruthie Schaeffer's husband - a Kuwaiti Air Force
major - joined a 100-car convoy in slipping into Iran from Iraq.
   ``My heart was beating out of my chest when they looked at my
identification papers - all fake,'' the 12-year military veteran
said Monday in a telephone interview from Tehran, Iran. ``I tried
to say anything nice.''
   So, to an Iraqi soldier, Kazem stammered: ``You are heroes.''
   ``And the Iraqi, he looked at me. He said `Do you really believe
we are heroes?'''
   ``And I said `Yes, I believe you are.' I gave him some
chocolate. He took it and then said: `We are not.' Then he let me
go.''
   The father of three, who asked that his last name be withheld to
protect family still in Kuwait, plans to join his American wife and
children in Germantown, Tenn., after securing a new passport later
this week.
   ``When I left I really felt I would never see him again. He was
torn between his country and his children,'' said Ruthie Schaeffer,
who fled Kuwait with her young children about a month after Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``I had very little hope that he'd get out alive,'' she said.
``But after all the waiting, waiting day by day, it's over. We're
going to start over.''
   An estimated 1,000 U.S. citizens are still trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait, their relatives remain hostages of Saddam, who on Monday
reportedly said he would release some elderly and sick Americans.
   For Kazem, the prospect of leaving Kuwait was wrenching.
Returning to the United States meant a reunion with his wife and
children. But for a career military officer and patriot, it also
was a personal admission of defeat.
   ``I did not want to go. If I leave the country and my friends in
the military leave, who's going to fight the Iraqis?'' Kazem said.
``But we were like animals ... hunted and with no where to hide.''
   The decision to leave finally was made for Kazem. ``My uncle
said I was endangering my family,'' he said. ``The Iraqis were
looking for me.''
   So at dawn on Oct. 8, Kazem took a set of false Iranian
identification and joined a caravan at a highway outside Kuwait
City for a seven-hour journey through Iraq and into Iran.
   Kazem said Monday that he'd learned through friends that Iraqi
officials last week put an end to the daily convoys, which were led
by Iranian Embassy officials ostensibly bringing their own citizens
home.
   ``There were at least a hundred cars in front of me and many
more behind,'' Kazem said. ``When I got to the border I saw some
friends there. They were hugging and kissing me. They'd heard two
days before that I had been killed.''
   Kazem, who never stayed in once place longer than 12 hours, said
at least three of his relatives - many of whom are in the military
- have been murdered by Iraqi troops. ``And many, many of my
friends - my best friends - in the military,'' he said.
   ``The Iraqis, they are looking in all the houses ... pulling out
nails, cutting ears, burning with their cigarettes,'' Kazem said.
``We in the military have to leave. What else to do?
   ``We fought; we did our best. But there are about 400,000 Iraqi
soldiers and we are what? Between 20,000 to 30,000. We are a small
country, a peaceful country. We've never had to fight before.''

   A Kuwaiti newspaper reported that Saddam
Hussein dreamed the prophet Mohammed appeared before him and told
the Iraqi president his country's missiles ``were pointed in the
wrong direction.''
   Reports on the dream that circulated in international financial
circles are said to have accounted in part for the largest one-day
drop ever on New York markets of oil prices - a fall of $5.41 a
barrel to $28.38. Oil prices plunged $5.65 a barrel to close at
$26.75 in London.
   Saddam is said to have told an audience of top aides who
murmured ``God be blessed'' how Mohammed appeared before him
swathed in white robes, the newspaper Al-Seyassah said Sunday.
   ``The prophet Mohammed visited me in my sleep all dressed in
pure white, but appearing concerned about something,'' Al-Seyassah
said.
   It quoted Saddam as relating:
   ```O prophet of the Lord,' I told him, `what is it you require
of me?' And he replied `I've come, Saddam, to call your attention
to a big mistake.'
   ```What is it O Prophet,' I asked, and he said `I see your
rockets deployed wrongly.'''
   Iraqi missiles have been reported to be pointing south toward
the hundreds of thousands of Western forces massed in and around
Saudi Arabia, which abuts the Kuwaiti border.
   ```How?' I asked, and he replied, ``They are not pointed in the
right direction,''' the paper said of Saddam's purported remarks.
   ```What is the direction you want, O Prophet of the Lord?' I
asked and he replied, `You know the direction and you should
correct it.'''
   Saddam then reportedly said, ``Suddenly the Prophet disappeared,
and it seems he only came to make that remark.''
   Al-Seyassah, whose report could not be independently confirmed,
is an arm of the ousted government of Kuwait, and has been active
in trying to discredit Saddam.
   Al-Seyassah is published in Saudi Arabia where the Kuwaiti
government fled after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Al-Seyassah said the story was being spread around Iraq's
capital of Baghdad by Iraqi intelligence in an apparent attempt to
prepare Iraqis psychologically for a pullout from Kuwait.
   There have been unconfirmed reports in recent days that Iraqi
troops were being pulled from major parts of Kuwait and amassing
around a fenced area that surrounds two northern Persian Gulf
islands and an oilfield that Saddam covets.

<TEXT>
   A teen-age defendant disrupted the second
Central Park jogger rape and attempted murder trial Monday when he
began sobbing and yelling that the prosecutor was lying.
   ``No! No! No! I can't deal with this,'' Kharey Wise, 18, cried
when Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer finished her
opening statement.
   Wise then bent forward and vomited next to the defense table.
   As court officers led him out of the courtroom, Wise screamed:
``I can't take this! It isn't true! She's lying! She's lying!''
   Wise is one of two teen-agers on trial in connection with the
gang rape and savage beating of a woman who was attacked during her
nightly run and left for dead in Central Park. In an earlier trial,
three youths were convicted of rape and assault but acquitted of
attempted murder.
   Howard Diller, attorney for co-defendant Kevin Richardson, 16,
asked Acting Justice Thomas Galligan for a mistrial or a separate
trial for his client. Diller said Wise had become ``stressed out''
and was ``foaming at the mouth.''
   The judge denied the motion, noting that the outburst occurred
just after he called a break in the session and the jurors had left
the courtroom.
   Galligan warned Wise he would be removed from the courtroom if
he disrupted the trial again.
   Shortly before Lederer finished her opening remarks, Wise had
rocked in his seat, talked to himself and held his hands to his
face. He bit his lip and pounded his forehead with his fist.
   Lederer said Wise and Richardson were among 30 youths who went
into Central Park the night of April 19, 1989, ``to beat, to rob,
to assault, to attack anyone they found in the park.''
   She said the defendants' guilt will be proved by the testimony
of bicyclists, joggers, police officers, medical and scientific
experts, and by their own written and videotaped statements.
   She said Richardson described in a videotaped statement how he
and the other youths hid in the dark and attacked the jogger when
she ran past.
   The prosecutor said Richardson describes how they ripped the
jogger's shirt off, how she screamed for help and how she scratched
Richardson's face.
   ``He tells how everyone was feeling her, how they took her pants
off and raped her,'' Lederer said.
   She said Wise made two videotaped statements because he
admittedly lied in the first one.
   In the second tape, he describes how he held the victim's leg
and fondled it while others raped her.
   Diller, who began his opening remarks immediately after the
15-minute break, told the jury that police put words in his
client's mouth. He suggested that Richardson confessed to things he
did not do, that he was tricked.
   Wise's lawyer, Colin Moore, told the jury in his opening that
the prosecution's case was ``an optical illusion, a conjurer's
trick, done with smoke and mirrors.''
   He said the prosecutor was promising more than she can deliver.
``I want you to compare the preview with the actual thing,'' he
said.
   Wise and Richardson are among six teen-agers who were charged in
connection with the attack on the female jogger and two male
runners that night.
   The first trial ended in five-to-10-year sentences - the maximum
for juvenile offenders - for Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and
Antron McCray, all 16. They were convicted of rape, assault,
robbery and riot, but acquitted of attempted murder and sodomy.
   The sixth defendant, Steven Lopez, 16, will be tried separately
on the charges early next year.
   Wise, 16 at the time of the attacks, faces adult penalties that
could total up to 57 years in prison if he is convicted on all
counts. Richardson, 14 when he was arrested, faces the same five to
10 years as the three convicted in the first trial.

   Iraqi military forces captured some of Kuwait's
cache of U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft missiles and apparently are
trying to learn how to use the weapons, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney said Monday.
   A State Department spokeswoman in Washington said most of
Kuwait's Hawk missiles were captured in Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.
   The United States had sold Kuwait five Hawk batteries and more
than 150 Hawk missiles. The Hawks are said to be superior to other
anti-aircraft weapons in the Iraqi arsenal.
   ``We don't know precisely how many they have. We do know that
the Iraqis captured some Hawk missiles that the Kuwaitis previously
acquired and they now have them,'' Cheney told journalists after
meeting President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``Whether or not they're able to make them function or not at
this point, we don't know,'' he said.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said: ``We assume
that the Iraqis are attempting to learn to use the Hawk systems.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Jordan had given assurances at ``the highest
levels'' that it was providing no assistance to Iraq in learning
how to use the Hawks. ``We have no collateral information to
dispute those assurances,'' she said.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that concerned U.S.
officials inquired after Israeli reports appeared saying Jordanian
technicians were teaching Iraqis how to use the missiles.
   The Post reported Iraq brought the Hawks back to Baghdad, where
Iraqi technicians were trying to learn how to use them.
   Many U.S. and allied military aircraft in the gulf region have
no ready means of protection against the Hawks, the newspaper cited
U.S. officials as saying.
   Cheney spoke to reporters after 45 minutes of talks with
President Francois Mitterrand. The talks completed Cheney's 10-day
European tour, which also included stops in London and Moscow. He
headed back to Washington late Monday.
   In an interview earlier Monday with the French television
network La Cinq, Cheney said ``there is no particular calendar''
for the U.N. sanctions against Iraq to drive Baghdad's troops out
of Kuwait.
   ``We believe that the sanctions are getting more and more
effective,'' he said. ``They're beginning to hve an impact on the
economy and to have an impact on their ... military potential.''

<HEAD>South Korean Prime Minister Met Sister in North, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon
secretly visited a sister he had not seen in 45 years during last
week's high-level talks in North Korea, according to Tuesday
newspaper reports.
   Two other senior Seoul officials also saw relatives, Korean
newspapers said, citing as their source North Korean reporters now
in Seoul for an inter-Korean soccer match.
   There was no confirmation. All three - Kang; National
Unification Minister Hong Sung-chul; and Limb Dong-won, chairman of
the state-run Institute for Foreign Affairs - were originally from
North Korea and all have said they wanted to meet their separated
family members.
   The reports said Kang, 65, saw his 64-year-old sister Yong-sun
and her son for an hour at the government guest house where he was
staying in Pyongyang. Kang fled to the South in 1945 when the
peninsula was divided.
   Hong and Limb also met relatives during the four-day stay, the
reports said.
   A spokesman for Kang had denied speculation Kang would see his
sister during the second round of talks. The spokesman said it
would be inappropriate to mix personal matters with the talks.
   The peninsula was divided in 1945 and the two nations fought a
1950-53 war. An estimated 10 million Koreans are separated from
family members on either side of the tightly sealed border.

   Nearly two weeks after he took $125,000 at
gunpoint from a currency exchange, a janitor who believes he has
cancer returned to New York to surrender, saying he did it to
``provide for my family.''
   ``It's no life on the run,'' Bernard Gamble, 59, said in an
interview published Monday. ``Stay with the ones you love for the
little time you have left. Give them all the love you can. Because
when you are alone, you have nothing.''
   Gamble robbed the Deak International currency exchange at
Kennedy International Airport of $125,000 on Oct. 7 while keeping
his co-workers at bay with a gun, authorities said. He told
employees he was dying of cancer and needed the money for his wife
and five children.
   Before fleeing, he dropped off $85,000 at his daughter's home in
the borough of Queens. He told New York Newsday he then spent most
of the time riding Greyhound buses between Chicago and Florida.
   His family immediately turned the money over to police and made
public appeals for their father to come home. Gamble returned to
the city Thursday and checked into a hospital on Friday for tests
for stomach cancer, said his attorney, Barry Slotnick.
   ``I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone,'' Gamble told
Newsday. ``All I wanted to do was provide for my family, give my
wife something to live on after I am gone.''
   Slotnick, who refused to divulge his client's whereabouts, said
Gamble would be arraigned on robbery charges Tuesday.
   ``There are no developments,'' said Richard Piperno, a spokesman
for Queens District Attorney John Santucci. He said he could not
comment further on the case.
   Slotnick said the family would return the rest of the money by
the end of the week.
   Gamble told Newsday that while on the run, he carried a slip of
paper with the name of his daughter and her telephone number, as
well as the phone number of his wife, Joanne, for notification in
case he died.
   He also said he did not read his family's appeals for his return
because he lost his glasses.
   Donna Chiorando said her father ``is back with the people who
love him. Now we're waiting to see what the doctors say. We're
waiting to find out how long he will be with us.''
   Gamble said he never planned a getaway, and was finally
persuaded to stop running when his only grandchild, 2-year-old John
Chiorando Jr., spoke to him on the phone.
   ``He said, `Grandpa, I love you. Come to my house and play ball
with me,''' Gamble said.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of organizing a ring that
smuggled illegal aliens across the Niagara River from Canada in
small rubber rafts pleaded guilty Monday to conspiracy.
   The ring, which smuggled mostly Chinese aliens, operated from
the summer of 1988 until the end of that year, when a raft sank in
the icy river. Two bodies were recovered and two others are
believed killed.
   Yick Tak Cheung, 41, of New York, faces up to five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine for the conspiracy count. Another ring
member, Wai Wei Cheng, 31, pleaded guilty Friday to one count of
transporting illegal aliens, U.S. Attorney Dennis C. Vacco said.
   U.S. District Judge John T. Elfvin was scheduled to sentence
both in January.
   U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service officials estimated
that the ring ferried several dozen aliens across the fast-running
river.
   The aliens entered Canada on real or phony tourist visas, then
paid smugglers up to thousands of dollars apiece to be smuggled
into the United States, authorities said.
   Taxi drivers James Dullan and Richard Kephardt testified in
pre-trial proceedings that they met aliens near the riverbank in
Lewiston, about 30 miles north of Buffalo, and drove drive them
either to the Buffalo airport or to New York City.
   U.S. authorities said the rafts had cellular telephones the
aliens or their escorts could use to arrange to be picked up upon
arrival.
   Authorities began investigating the ring in the fall of 1988
after groups of wet, bewildered Asians were seen in the small
border village of Lewiston. The case was cracked when the raft
sank.
   Dullan and Kephardt pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the summer
of 1989 and became government witnesses.
   Minh Hoang, accused of ferrying the aliens across the river,
pleaded guilty in Canada to negligent homicide and is serving a
21-month prison sentence there.
   INS officials said Tick and his wife, Cheng Chui-Ping, each ran
separate smuggling rings catering primarily to Chinese destined for
New York.
   Ms. Cheng pleaded guilty over the summer to conspiracy to
transport illegal aliens and was sentenced to six months in prison.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph will raise its
basic night and weekend long-distance phone prices by 2.2 percent,
beginning Nov. 2, the company said on Monday.
   ``The change is necessary to bring prices in line with costs,''
said Merrill Tutton, vice president of AT&amp;T Consumer Services.
   The company said the increase will result in about $39.4 million
in increased annual revenue.
   That amounts to about five cents on an average $16 monthly
long-distance bill, the company said.
   AT&amp;T said the increase applies only to out-of-state
direct-dialed long distance calls made during night and weekend
hours.
   These are after 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday and all weekend
until 5 p.m. Sunday.
   The company said that overall its out-of-state direct-dialed
long-distance rates have gone down about 42 percent since the
breakup of the Bell System in 1984.

<HEAD>External Examination of Cassette Recorder Wouldn't Reveal Bomb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUMFRIES, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The radiocassette recorder packed with
explosives that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 could have worked
normally and the bomb would have been difficult to detect, an
explosives expert said Monday.
   Anyone examining the Toshiba twin-speed recorder would have seen
nothing suspicious on the outside, said Alan Faraday, head of the
forensic explosives laboratory at the Royal Armament Research and
Development Establishment.
   He told a public inquiry into the Dec. 21, 1988, terrorist
bombing that killed 270 people there was ``no reason'' why the
recorder should not work normally even with the device inside.
   ``I am certain that if someone had seen it and turned it on it
would have been insufficient to determine it had been modified,''
he said.
   Passengers carrying cassette recorders or radios at British
airports are routinely asked by security personnel to turn them on.
   New security measures agreed on after the Pan Am disaster
require security staff to make other checks, ``but we can't go into
that because of security,'' a Department of Transport spokesman
said on condition of anonymity.
   Asked by Scotland's chief law officer, Lord Advocate Lord
Fraser, if the device would have shown up on airport X-ray
machines, Faraday said it would have taken an extremely good
operator to spot it.
   Faraday said experiments showed only a small amount of explosive
could be hidden in the player, but that the cassette recorder would
look like an ordinary machine without any external signs of a
concealed bomb.
   Faraday said a number of items had been found in the wreckage
that indicated a Toshiba recorder had been used to hide the device.
   He said examination of a luggage container from the jumbo's
wreckage showed the ``unique characteristics'' of a close
detonation.
   Specimens taken from the wreckage showed evidence of two types
of chemicals that are manufactured as ``colorless, crystalized
substances,'' he said.
   Both chemicals are used in the Semtex explosives made in
Czechoslovakia, he said.
   ``I don't know of any other explosives that are manufactured
including these two ingredients other than the Semtex range but
there could be others,'' he said.
   Before Faraday gave evidence, the presiding judge, Sheriff
Principal John Mowat, said it would be ``undesirable'' for Faraday
to be photographed or sketched while around the court.
   The inquiry, expected to last into the new year, is focusing on
the deaths of 259 people aboard the Boeing 747 and 11 on the ground
in Lockerbie, and ways to prevent a similar disaster.
   Scottish investigators have said they are investigating several
radical Palestinian groups, but the inquiry is not considering
criminal responsibility.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Arsenic Poisoning Goes on Trial</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A woman accused of giving arsenic to
two husbands and a boyfriend went on trial Monday for the
boyfriend's death. But her attorney said it was yet another man who
was responsible for the crimes.
   The prosecutor told jurors that Blanche Taylor Moore had forged
a chain of overlapping relationships with men that led her to
murder Raymond Reid, a boyfriend with whom she had worked at a
supermarket.
   Defense attorney Mitchell McEntire insisted on the innocence of
the 57-year-old grocery clerk, whom he described as a hard-working,
churchgoing mother.
   ``Her life has not been above sin. Sin has touched her life,''
McEntire said. ``But she is free of guilt in any crime. For indeed,
she is not guilty.''
   Mrs. Moore is being tried in Forsyth County Superior Court on a
charge of first degree murder in Reid's death. She also has been
charged with killing her first husband, James N. Taylor, and trying
to kill her second husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore. Those cases are
being tried separately.
   McEntire pinned the crimes on Garvin Thomas, who apparently had
an obsession from afar with Mrs. Moore and ``could not bear the
thought of another man having her.''
   The defense attorney said Thomas signed a letter confessing to
the three poisonings, which took place over 15 years, but died
before the letter reached the Alamance County Jail, where Mrs.
Moore was being held.
   However, McEntire said Thomas had visited his office several
weeks earlier. ``He said: `Your client didn't do these things. I
know your client is innocent,' '' the defense lawyer told the
court.
   In his opening arguments, Forsyth County District Attorney
Warren Sparrow described Mrs. Moore's tangled web of relationships
with men.
   He said Mrs. Moore's relationship with Reid began in the
mid-1960s. Reid was divorced in 1971 and James N. Taylor, then Mrs.
Moore's husband, died in 1973 of what investigators now believe was
arsenic poisoning.
   ``Raymond Reid gave her money and jewels over the years to
come,'' Sparrow said. ``But in January 1985, the defendant decided
that Raymond Reid might not really be the man she wanted.''
   During that time, Mrs. Moore was counseled by a psychiatrist,
Sparrow said. ``The primary topic between the defendant and her
psychiatrist was more her inability to get along with Raymond
Reid,'' Sparrow said.
   McEntire said psychological tests performed during that time
found that Mrs. Moore displayed no hostility, multiple
personalities or any other similar traits.
   ``Blanche Moore is not deranged, nor does she carry a load of
hostility or repressed anger,'' he said.
   Reid died on Oct. 7, 1986. At the time, his death was attributed
to Guillain-Barre syndrome, the symptoms of which are similar to
those of arsenic poisoning.
   Mrs. Moore married Dwight Moore in 1989. Three days after their
wedding, Moore became ill with what doctors have described as a
near-fatal bout with arsenic poisoning.

<HEAD>Avenson May Leave Church Over Abortion Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Don
Avenson said Monday he may leave a church his family founded
because the minister threatened to expel him for continuing to
support abortion rights.
   Avenson said he's discussed resigning from the church with his
family and has written to the church hierarchy explaining his
stance.
   Avenson belongs to Peace Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. The
Missouri Synod of the church opposes abortion rights.
   The controversy began on Sunday when Avenson released a copy of
a letter from the minister of his church criticizing his
``persistent outspokenness for abortion.''
   The minister, Rev. Bruce Scarbeary, said he wanted to talk with
Avenson about abortion rights ``in view of your continued
membership in the congregation.''
   Avenson said the dispute ``is exactly why we ought not to be
drafting into statutes the theology of any given church. It leads
to problems for people who don't believe that theology.''
   Though the letter didn't directly threaten to expel him from the
church, Avenson said that's the way he interpreted the letter.
   ``I'm not going to get involved in a private matter between Don
Avenson and his minister,'' said Republican Gov. Terry Branstad,
who said there should be no ``mixing of church and state.''
Branstad opposes abortion rights.

<HEAD>Five Women Run for Four Top State Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The old boy's club of California
politics may become a thing of the past.
   Five contenders for four top offices are women. If they win,
women candidates for governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer and
secretary of state would in a single election quadruple the gains
that women have made in top-level state politics over the past 34
years.
   Democrat Dianne Feinstein is waging an aggressive battle for
governor against Republican Pete Wilson. And Democratic challenger
Kathleen Brown - the daughter of one former governor and the sister
of another - is leading appointed GOP incumbent Thomas Hayes in the
race for treasurer.
   California is virtually assured to retain a woman for secretary
of state. Democratic incumbent March Fong Eu, only the second woman

<HEAD>Gay Lobby Gives Record Amount to Republican Candidates</HEAD>

   The nation's largest gay and lesbian lobby has
given a record $76,000 to Republican candidates for the U.S. House
and Senate, a spokesman said Monday.
   The Human Rights Campaign Fund made the contributions because
support for gay causes can be found in both parties, said Timothy
McFeeley, the fund's executive director.
   The $76,000 accounted for 18 percent of the lobby's total
contributions this election cycle, McFeeley said.
   The fund gave the legal limit - $10,000 - to three GOP
candidates: Rep. Ron Machtley of Rhode Island, Trudy Coxe, who is
running for the seat being vacated by Rep. Claudine Schneider of
Rhode Island; and Rep. John Miller of Washington.
   Rep. Bill Green, a moderate New York City Republican with strong
ties to the gay community, received $7,000.

   Israeli forces blocked Palestinians from
entering Jerusalem on Monday to prevent clashes following the
murders of three Jews by a knife-wielding Arab.
   A Palestinian teen-ager was killed and 19 others were
hospitalized with wounds suffered in clashes with Israeli troops
Monday throughout the occupied West Bank, Arab reports said.
   Despite the heightened security in Jerusalem, a Palestinian
stabbed a Jew, slightly injuring him. Police searched a nearby
village for the assailant.
   Also Monday, an 18-year-old Palestinian died of wounds suffered
in an August 1988 clash. Mohammed Naim Abu Akar was known among
Palestinians as ``the living martyr'' for surviving on intravenous
feedings after Israeli bullets destroyed his intestines.
   Later, police in downtown Jerusalem arrested a 23-year-old
Palestinian after he tried to stab one of the officers, police
spokesman Aharon Elchayani said. Israel television said the
attacker came from the West Bank in spite of the travel ban.
   Jews angered by Sunday's killings stoned Arab cars and beat
several Arab pedestrians, Israel radio said. It blamed members of
the anti-Arab Kach Party, saying they were bent on inciting
trouble.
   After the violence, national police headquarters announced the
ban on Palestinians entering Jerusalem would continue for at least
a second day Tuesday ``in view of the present tension in the
city.''
   The blockade does not affect the 140,000 Palestinians living in
Jerusalem, but does apply to thousands who come from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip to work in the city.
   Police spokesman Ron Yishayahu said that in addition to a
``massive deployment of police forces'' in Jerusalem, night patrols
by police and paramilitary troops would be stepped up.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir blamed the violence on ``a
terrible atmosphere of incitement'' in the Arab world following
President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``There is some kind of delusion that redemption will come from
Baghdad and that once and for all, the Arabs will get rid of the
`Zionist satan,''' Shamir told reporters.
   He said Israel was prepared to take tougher steps to stop
attacks, adding the Jewish state would ``surmount this wave of
hostility and terrorism.''
   Shortly after Shamir spoke, his right-wing coalition survived
its second no-confidence motion since taking office June 11. The
53-51 vote, with two abstentions, was forced by left-wing parties
angered by Shamir's handling of the economy, relations with the
United States and Soviet immigrants.
   Serious clashes in Jerusalem began Oct. 8, when police fired on
Moslems on the Temple Mount after they stoned Jewish worshipers at
the nearby Western Wall. At least 19 Palestinians were killed and
140 wounded.
   On Sunday, a knife-wielding Palestinian apparently sought to
avenge the killings on the Temple Mount, known to Arabs as Haram
es-Sharif. He attacked Jews in Jerusalem, killing three and
wounding a 13-year-old boy.
   Two victims, a woman soldier and a gardener, were buried Sunday.
The third, an off-duty policeman who died stopping the attacker,
was buried Monday.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the 19-year-old man arrested for the Sunday stabbings
``obviously had gone temporarily insane.''
   ``The president deplores the tragic killings of three Israeli
citizens,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``These
killings make it all the more important that the cycle of violence
be ended. We urge all parties to act to reinforce peace and calm in
the region.''
   The Bush administration supported an Oct. 12 U.N. Security
Council resolution condemning Israeli police for the slayings and
authorizing Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to send
investigators to the city.
   On Monday, a Palestinian armed with a bayonet-style blade
attacked a Jewish man delivering meat to a supermarket in a Jewish
neighborhood of Arab east Jerusalem. The victim, Moshe Koren, 46,
was slightly wounded in the back.
   Police pursued the attacker, who worked at the market, to nearby
Hizmeh, his home village. Door-to-door searches were reported.
   Police poured reinforcements into Jerusalem and set up army and
police roadblocks to bar Palestinians from the occupied territories
from entering the city.They said they wanted to prevent further
attacks on Jews and head off possible revenge attacks on Arabs.
   A soldier was stabbed by an ax-wielding Palestinian inside a
military government building Monday in the Gaza town of Rafah, the
army said. The army spokesman's office said the soldier was
slightly wounded.
   Scattered stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops were
reported in a half-dozen towns and refugee camps in the occupied
territories. Arab hospital officials said at least 19 Palestinians
were admitted with gunshot wounds.
   In the West Bank town of Jenin, Mahmoud Lahlouh, 14, died after
a live bullet hit him in the chest, the army said.
   His death and the death of the so-called ``living martyr''
raised to 763 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the 34-month uprising against Israeli occupation.
   An additional 284 were slain by fellow Arabs, most for allegedly
collaborating with Israel. Fifty-one Israelis have died in the
violence.

   The head of a museum that displayed photographs by
Robert Mapplethorpe says politics is the reason why the hea of the
National Endowment for the Arts rejected a grant for another
exhibit there.
   ``A week ago I would have said no, but now I would say that
maybe there is an informal blacklist,'' said David A. Ross,
director of the Institute of Contemporary Art.
   The institute drew protests this summer with the Mapplethorpe
show. In Cincinnati, a gallery and its director were acquitted of
obscenity charges after showing the same photos.
   NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer told Ross he was rejecting a
$40,000 grant to fund an exhibit by Los Angeles mixed-media artist
Mike Kelley. The grant had been approved by an NEA selection panel.
   ``It is almost unprecedented in the history of the NEA that an
application for a gallery is approved by a peer review panel and
then gets rejected by the director,'' said Arthur Cohen, the
institute's marketing director.
   An NEA spokeswoman denied that.
   ``It's not unusual for grants to be rejected at any level
because of last-minute information or whatever,'' said spokeswoman
Virginia Falck.
   Falck said NEA policy prevented the organization from saying why
it rejected the grant, out of consideration of the artist's
privacy.
   ``We get 18,000 applications a year, and we have money for only
about 4,000,'' she said.
   Ross, however, cried foul.
   ``I see this action as an insult to the peer review system and
to the artist as well as integrity of the Institute,'' he said. ``I
am both saddened and angered by it.''
   ``We will do the show no matter what,'' Ross said.
   Traditionally, NEA grants are recommended by a peer panel and
referred to the National Council on the Arts, the agency's
26-member advisory board, but the chairman has the authority to
approve or deny grants on his own.
   A late afternoon statement by the NEA said the council rejected
the application in May, and Frohnmayer accepted that
recommendation, but didn't tell the Boston museum because of a
clerical error.
   ``Owing to an administrative oversight, the Institute for
Contemporary Arts in Boston was not notified,'' the NEA said. ``The
Art Endowment deeply regrets the error. It always is our intention
to notify rejected grantees as soon as possible so that they can go
on with their business.''
   Before the statement was issued, Ross said: ``It appears that a
fully political decision was made to reject this grant because the
work may be considered controversial to some. ... It deals with any
number of aspects of the dissolution of American society on a
social and psychological level. (Kelley) deals with great humor and
great wit and with great force and darkness as well.''
   Kelley's work includes pen and ink drawings, painting, film and
other mediums, such as arranging stuffed animals in a room to
appear as though they are having conversations.
   Cohen said the only piece of Kelley's art that people might
consider offensive was a cartoonish drawing of a man defecating.
Kelley's drawings also include depictions of disembodied sexual
organs.
   Ross said Kelley's work is part of several museums' permanent
collections, including the Hirschhorn Museum in Washington, New
York's Museum of Modern Art and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
   The NEA controversy began last year when Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., and other conservatives in Congress objected to NEA funding
of works they considered obscene.
   Helms singled out the Mapplethorpe exhibit, ``The Perfect
Moment,'' for its sexually graphic photographs and nude children.
   Last week, a House compromise that would have allowed the NEA to
award grants without content restrictions was derailed by the
Senate Appropriations Committee, which reinstituted an
anti-obscenity pledge that artists must sign before they receive
grant money.
   The Kelley exhibit is scheduled to be shown in Boston in October
1992 and tour other museums across the nation and in Europe.

<HEAD>Rio Montt Accuses President of Hijinks in Guatemala Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALFONSO ANZUETO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former dictator Jose Efrain Rios Montt,
himself banned from running, was said Monday to have accused
President Vinicio Cerezo of planning to fix Nov. 11 elections to
favor his Christian Democratic Party.
   The newspaper Prensa Libre said the retired general leveled the
charge at a political rally last weekend in Chiquimula, 104 miles
east of Guatemala City.
   It quoted Rios Montt as saying Cerezo plans to stack the
balloting in favor of Alfonso Cabrera Hidalgo, the presidential
nominee of Cerezo's centrist Christian Democrats. Rios Montt
offered no evidence, the paper said.
   ``King Vinicio and his court are preparing the throne for prince
Cabrera because they think we are still 450 years back, and they
are trying to manipulate the law,'' Rios Montt was quoted as
saying.
   He urged his supporters to write his name on ballots ``to show
that it is you who want me in power.'' By law, this would
automatically invalidate the ballot. Enough invalid ballots could
scuttle next month's election.
   Rios Montt also said he was robbed of victory when he ran for
president on the Christian Democratic ticket in 1974. He said the
election was fixed to put conservative Gen. Eugenio Kjell Laugerud
in power.
   There was no immediate response from Cerezo or the Christian
Democrats.
   Rios Montt was prohibited from running in next month's election
because he became president as a result of a military coup 7{ years
ago.
   Cerezo completes his five-year term Jan. 14, the first civilian
elected president in 17 years in a country convulsed by a leftist
guerrilla insurrection the past three decades. All the rest have
been rightist military men.
   A born-again Protestant, Rios Montt headed a military junta that
overthrew President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garcia, an elected army
general, in March 1982.
   Three months later, he forced out the junta's two other officers
and stayed on as president until the military forced him out in
August 1983.
   While in power, he cracked down on crime and the guerrillas. He
had more than a dozen suspected rebel leaders summarily executed by
firing squad.
   Until banned under provisions of a constitutional reform enacted
by Cerezo, Rios Montt was a frontrunning candidate who advocated a
war on crime. He was the nominee of a three-party rightist
coalition.
   Public opinion polls indicated he appealed most to middle-class
people fed up with a crime wave that has been sweeping Guatemala
the past three years.
   Efforts to negotiate an end to the leftist insurrection plan
have failed so far. Human rights organizations estimate more than
100,000 people have been killed since the early 1960s.
   Rebel leaders say they back none of the 12 presidential
candidates, but are meeting in Mexico with representatives of
Guatemalan political parties, labor unions and other popular
groups.

   Assailants in a car shot to death six
students on a protest fast and left another person dead and 14
injured when they sped away in a blaze of gunfire, police said
Monday.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing
rules, said the gunmen were suspected Sikh extremists fighting for
a separate state in the northern Punjab.
   The killings occurred in a downtown market in the state capital
of Chandigarh.
   The victims were among a group of upper-caste students sitting
under a tent on a hunger strike to protest federal job quotas that
reserve half of 18 million government jobs for low-castes.
   The spokesman said the students were all 17 or younger.
   The seventh victim was a street vendor who died when the gunmen
fired at onlookers while fleeing, he said. Six of the injured were
reported in serious condition.
   Immediately after the shooting, a mob set fire to two
government-owned buses and hurled stones at a police vehicle.
Curfew was imposed and the army arrived to assist police, United
News of India news agency said.
   Thousands of students across northern India have been protesting
the job quotas announced Aug. 7 by Prime Minister V.P. Singh. At
least 67 students have committed suicide in protest and another 67
have died in street clashes with police.
   Student groups in Punjab were reported to have rejected offers
for help by Sikh extremists.
   Earlier Monday, Sikh extremists lured a government patrol down
an isolated road and detonated a land mine that killed four police
officers and wounded 10 others, authorities said.
   The three-jeep patrol was headed to Vadalakan village to
investigate a reported shooting attack by militants on a police
post. The village is 100 miles east of Chandigarh.
   No one was injured in the shooting attack on the police post,
police said.
   Press Trust of India said nine other people were killed in Sikh
militant violence in the state Monday. It did not give details.
   Sikh militants have killed at least 2,439 people this year.
   The separatist revolt started in 1983 with Sikh militants
accusing India's Hindu-dominated government of economic and
political discrimination.
   Sikhs hold a slim majority over Hindus in Punjab, but account
for only 2 percent of India's 880 million people while Hindus
account for 82 percent.

<HEAD>Finance Inspector, Boss Suspended in French Wiretap Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city suspended a finance inspector and his boss
for illegally wiretapping municipal officials during investigations
into alleged fraud, officials announced Monday.
   Assistant Mayor Jean Tiberi said the pair had been removed from
their workplaces following an internal probe sparked by a newspaper
report of the illegal wiretaps.
   The weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported last week that wiretaps
had been conducted by Paris' General Inspection department without
required court authorization.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac ordered an immediate investigation into the
department, which is assigned to police against financial
irregularities in the city government.
   Tiberi reported the wiretaps stemmed from ``individual
initiative'' during a probe into alleged fraud into the city
department dealing with the restaurant industry.
   The squad investigating the wiretaps found a tiny transmitter
the size of a matchbox in the telephone of Maurice Guilmault, chief
of the restaurant department, Tiberi said.
   The agent, Hubert Rosenzweig, and his superior, Guy Legris, who
was apparently unaware of the operation, have been suspended from
their duties, Tiberi said.
   No other wiretaps appear to have been planted, Tiberi said.
   Tiberi added that the probe into the restaurant department would
continue and that an official report will be made public.
   The case follows two other recent wiretapping controversies. In
one, the chief executive and several employees of the Century
surveillance company were charged with illegal wiretapping.
   In the other, questions have been raised about police wiretaps
of a maverick pastor, Joseph Douce, who has been missing since
July. He was under surveillance by officers suspicious of his
associations with homosexuals.
   The national government is considering possible changes in its
wiretapping law. The existing law, requiring a judge's consent, is
believed to be widely defied, both by government agencies and
private firms.

   At least 46 children have died over the last
eight years when they were struck by closing automatic garage
doors, government safety experts said Monday.
   They urged homeowners to replace doors without automatic
reverse. The children were killed when garage doors did not reverse
automatically, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said.
   The agency urged homeowners to help save children's lives by
checking garage door openers and to have them repaired or replaced
immediately if they fail to reverse after striking an object.
   Many garage-door units manufactured before 1982 do not have
automatic reverse.
   ``Some older door openers are euipped with a device that only
stops the closing door and does not reverse it when it strikes an
object,'' the commission said.
   Some of the older doors doors may have a device intended to
cause the closing door to reverse but, because of wear, poor
maintenance or a bad installation, may not be safe enough to
prevent child deaths, the commission said.
   It said these door-closing devices cannot be adjusted or
repaired to provide the safety available in garage door openers
produced in 1982 and after.
   Homeowners concerned about their doors can safety by placing a
two-inch wooden block in the path of the door, the commission said.
``If the door does not promptly reverse on striking the block, the
unit should be disengaged and a service technician called to see if
repairs are needed,'' it added
   It said the old garage door should be replaced if it does not
have a working automatic reverse.
   The commission advised that additional safeguards now are
available to protect children.
   It said closing units made after 1982 can be improved with an
``electric eye'' near the floor to reverse a closing garage door
automatically whenever an object crosses the path of the door.
   It also advised homeowners to relocate wall switches out of the
reach of young children and to keep remote control units in the
glove compartment of the car.

<TEXT>
   The Arab League on Monday formally
appointed Assaad el-Assaad of Lebanon as secretary general, a post
he has filled since Chedli Klibi quit last month amid criticism of
his handling of the gulf crisis.
   The appointment is for two years. Sources close to the 21-member
League said the Council of Ministers named Ahmed Adel Ismail of
Egypt, Adnane Omrane of Syria and Mongi Fakih of Tunisia as
assistant secretaries general.
   The sources did not say how the League members voted. Under
Article 12 of the League's constitution, a two-thirds majority is
required for appointments.
   The council was meeting in the Tunisian capital to discuss the
transfer of the League headquarters to Cairo and the financial
compensation of employees who cannot make the move.
   The sources said Iraq opposed the move. Egypt is one of the main
countries opposing it in the Persian Gulf conflict.
   The five-nation Union of Arab Maghreb including Algeria, Libya,
Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia has asked that the move be
postponed from the scheduled move Oct. 31.
   Transfer to Cairo, approved earlier this year, turned into a
bone of contention with the onset of the gulf crisis, which has
seen the group split into pro- and anti-Iraqi camps.
   El-Assaad, 70, the doyen of the former secretary-general's
assistants, has been running the League's executive and
administrative functions since Klibi resigned on Sept. 3.
   Klibi, a Tunisian, had come under severe criticism for his
inability to prevent a fracture in the League over the crisis. His
government has aligned itself with Iraq and opposed the relocation.
   Tunisia boycotted the League meeting in Cairo on Sept. 10 where
a majority of countries endorsed the sending of foreign troops to
the gulf to counter Iraq's annexation of Kuwait.
   Klibi had been secretary general of the League since it moved
from Cairo to Tunis in 1979. He was reappointed to a five-year term
in March.

   Twelve people were sentenced to death and three
to life imprisonment at a public rally in northwest China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, an official report said.
   The Intermediate People's Court of Urumqi, the regional capital,
publicly sentenced the criminals on Sept. 13, the Xinjiang Daily
reported in its Sept. 16 edition, seen in Beijing on Monday.
   The report gave details of only four of the criminals.
   On July 23, Zhou Xinxu, Zhou Xijian and Ahbulaiti, from one of
China's ethnic minority groups, charged into the home of the Chai
family, tied them up and demanded money.
   The Chai's 11-year-old son began crying, and Ahbulaiti shot him
in the chest with a stolen submachine gun, wounding the boy's
mother and uncle, the paper said.
   In another incident, Yumiti-Yibulayin, also a minority, was
already serving a seven-year prison term when he ordered a cellmate
to attack a newcomer to their cell. Zhang Weimin was so badly
beaten that he went into shock from loss of blood and his heart
stopped. He was sent to hospital but doctors were unable to save
him, the report said.
   The four were sentenced to death along with eight others that
the report did not give details about. It said the court ordered
them to be immediately executed.
   Executions in China are by a single bullet to the back of the
head.
   Three others were sentenced to life in prison and four to jail
terms of 3-15 years, the paper said without giving details of their
crimes.

<HEAD>Gibbs Looks for More Scoring from Redskin Drives</HEAD>

   Coach Joe Gibbs wouldn't mind trading some
of the long drives the Washington Redskins have gotten so good at
for a few more points on the scoreboard.
   The Redskins 13-7 victory over Philadelphia on Sunday
highlighted the nagging trouble Washington has had getting the ball
in the end zone this season.
   ``If you put teams on the 20 every week, they're going to have a
tough time getting it in against anybody,'' Gibbs said Monday. The
Eagles ``had a hard time getting it in against us and we had a
tough time against them.
   ``That's what happens when you don't score from outside on long
plays,'' he said.
   ``We hurt ourselves in scoring opportunities because we had some
key third down shots down around the 30 that hurt us,'' Gibbs said.
``We missed a blitz read and dropped two balls in there that cost
us big plays.''
   The Redskins moved deep into Philadelphia territory on their
first six possessions in Sunday's game, but they stalled on all but
one of the drives and had just a 7-0 lead to show for the effort.
   Their first two drives got to the Eagles' 31. But Earnest Byner
lost two on a 3rd-and-1 play on the first possession and
quarterback Stan Humphries tossed a pass into the hands of safety
Wes Hopkins, who dropped it, on 3rd-and-3 the next time and the
Redskins got no points.
   Finishing drives has been one of their problems in close games
this year. Throw out their 38-10 rout of the Cardinals' porous
defense, and the Redskins had scored three touchdowns the eight
times they have gotten inside the 20.
   Their lone TD Sunday, a 1-yard plunge by Gerald Riggs, was set
up by a big play - Art Monk's diving reception inside the 1 for a
44-yard gain.
   ``Normally against Philadelphia you expect to hit a couple of
big plays. We just hit one,'' Gibbs said.
   Their lack of a finishing touch was magnified against the Eagles
by four missed field goals by Chip Lohmiller. The kicker is now 10
of 12 on attempts inside the 40 and 2 of 7 from beyond the 40.
   Humphries drove the Redskins back to within sight of the goal
posts in the fourth quarter and Lohmiller connected from 33 and 39
yards for the final winning margin.
   ``We do not want to do something stupid like turn the ball
over'' near the end zone, Gibbs said. ``We're getting our shots.
When you miss field goals, it hurts you dramatically against good
football teams.''
   The offense has had to adjust to a second quarterback after Mark
Rypien went down with a knee injury in the third week. Humphries'
three starts since then are his first in the NFL.
   Humphries was 14-of-31 for 200 yards against Philadelphia and
has thrown two TDs in his three starts.
   ``Stan made some very good plays,'' Gibbs said. ``There were
also several times there when he got balls in their hands. There's
good news and bad news there. There were three balls we could have
gotten in trouble with.''
   Meanwhile, defensive end Markus Koch's sprained left knee was
examined by doctors on Monday and coaches said it was doubtful he
would be able to play against the New York Giants this Sunday.
   Gibbs said he would decide later this week whether to place Koch
on injured reserve, which would idle him for at least four weeks.
Koch's spot on the roster would likely be taken by defensive tackle
Jumpy Geathers, who has recovered from major knee surgery and is
ready to be activated.

   President Elias Hrawi's government worked
on plans Monday to disarm gunmen in Christian and Moslem militias
who are involved in the 15{-year-old civil war, and to gain the
release of Western hostages held by Moslem extremists.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss branded as ``interference in Lebanon's
domestic affairs'' a French request that the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council convene to discuss the Lebanese
conflicts.
   He said he communicated this official position to the five
permanent members - France, the United States, the Soviet Union,
China and Britain.
   France's request was announced Monday by French Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas. France considers itself the protector of Lebanon's
Christians, who supported France's mandate from 1920-43 in Lebanon.
   Dumas said the assassination of Christian leader Dany Chamoun
with his wife and two small sons at their home east of Beirut on
Sunday ``shows the extent of the horrors'' of Lebanon's civil
strife.
   Leaders of France's right-wing opposition have held Syria
reponsible for the killings that followed the ending of Gen. Michel
Aoun's mutiny on Oct. 13.
   Aoun, who operated from an enclave in the Christian heartland,
has taken refuge in the French Embassy after being driven out by
Hrawi's troops and the Syrian army.
   ``The only issue Lebanon wants the Security Council to discuss
is Israel's occupation of the border enclave in south Lebanon and
the implementation of Resolution 425 calling on Israel to
withdraw,'' Hoss said.
   ``We are in the process to preparing a demand for the
application of U.N. sanctions against Israel for refusing to pull
out.''
   Hoss issued his statement after returning from daylong talks in
Damascus with Syrian leaders to speed up reunification of Beirut
now that Aoun, the major foe of an Arab League-brokered peace plan,
has been removed.
   A Hrawi aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
president himself returned from the Syrian capital Sunday night
with plans to disband the militias and gain the hostages' release.
   Hours before, gunmen had killed Chamoun, younger son of the late
President Camille Chamoun, and his family.
   The Christian area staged a daylong strike Monday to protest the
slayings. Chamoun was a key supporter of Aoun.
   Aoun had opposed the peace pact because it did not guarantee
complete withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops, in Lebanon since 1976.
   In New York, the Council of Lebanese-American Organizations
asked the Security Council to convene an emergency session to move
a battalion of U.N. peackeeping forces from southern Lebanon to
Christian areas to halt purported violence by Syrians and militias.
   The Hrawi aide said ``filling the security vacuum'' in areas
formerly held by Aoun is the government's No. 1 priority.
   The official Syrian Arab News Agency reported Monday the
Lebanese army will now assume security tasks in Aoun's former
areas.
   Pro-Syrian groups blamed the Chamoun killings on Christian
warlord Samir Geagea, whose Lebanese Forces militia fought
unsuccessfully with Aoun's troops for mastery of the Christian
heartland this year.
   Geagea denied involvement. He joined other Christian and Moslem
leaders in urging Hrawi's government to bring peace to the area
that had been controlled by Aoun's forces.
   Hrawi told Syria's state television network over the weekend
that ``all militias will be disbanded by peaceful means, but we'll
use other means if we face objections. I warn everybody that no
opposition by the gun or the cannon will be tolerated.''
   A dozen major militias are blamed for most of the 150,000 deaths
in the civil war.
   The Hrawi aide said among the areas to be cleared of fighters
are the south Beirut slums, stronghold of the fundamentalist Shiite
Moslem Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is the umbrella for pro-Iranian extremists holding
most of the 13 missing Westerners, including six Americans. Longest
held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Hrawi's aide said the Syrians will discuss plans to move into
the slums with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati when he
visits Damascus later this week.
   ``This will definitely include the fate of the Western hostages,
whether they're held in the slums or have been smuggled out to the
Bekaa Valley,'' a Syrian-controlled area in eastern Lebanon, the
aide added.
   ``There's a Syrian-Lebanese understanding that the hostage issue
should be resolved in parallel with the creation of a greater
Beirut.''

   Kuwait on Monday appealed to the International
Civil Aviation Organization to condemn Iraq for stealing 15 of its
aircraft and registering them as part of the Iraqi Airways fleet.
   ``On the morning of Aug. 2, Iraqi warplanes bombed the Kuwait
International Airport where 18 aircraft were on the ground,'' Sheik
Jaber Mubarak Al-Sabah, head of Kuwait's Civil Aviation Authority,
told a news conference here.
   ``Iraq unlawfully seized aircraft owned by Kuwait, Lebanon,
Morocco and the United Kingdom. Aviation equipment - essential to
the operations of an international airport - were systematically
dismantled.
   ``And you may find it hard to believe, but even the immigration
counters in the terminal have been stolen and taken to Iraq.''
   The head of Iraq's delegation to ICAO, Tariq Salbi, refused
Monday to comments on the charges.
   Al-Sabah said among the 15 Kuwaiti aircraft taken were five
Airbus 310s and three Airbus 300-600s - all multimillion-dollar
widebodied jets made by a British-French consortium.
   Kuwait has eight aircraft now flying out of Cairo while the
country is occupied by Iraq.
   The 162-member organization, which is concerned with airline
safety and security, took up the matter in a session Monday when
Kuwait asked for the group to consider its resolution. The only
dissenting voice was Iraq. Eight nations abstained.
   Following 10 resolutions imposing an economic embargo on Iraq,
passed last month by the U.N. Security Council in New York,
Kuwait's resolution asked ICAO delegates to:
   -Condemn Iraq for violating Kuwaiti airspace;
   -Declare the registration of Kuwait's planes as part of the
Iraqi fleet to be null and void;
   -Demand all states that may find the stolen aircraft on their
soil turn them over to the Kuwaiti authorities;
   -Request all states refrain from supplying Iraq with any spare
parts, equipment, supplies or services for the stolen aircraft.

   An Iraqi vessel apparently dumped
its cargo overboard rather than have it seized under U.N.-approved
economic sanctions, U.S. military officials said Monday.
   Following a 48-hour chase that included three rounds of warning
shots, sailors who boarded the vessel al-Bahar al-Arabi in the Gulf
of Oman on Monday found ``no prohibited cargo,'' a Navy spokesman
said.
   On Saturday in the Persian Gulf, crews from the destroyer USS
O'Brien reported the 5,700-ton Iraqi ship was carrying steel pipe
and plywood, which are blocked by the embargo.
   ``We don't know what happened to it, and can only assume that it
was dumped overboard sometime between the first boarding and the
second boarding,'' said Cmdr. J.D. van Sickle, a Navy spokesman.
   After the second inspection, the ship was allowed to continue,
he said.
   The ship's captain, who was not identified, originally said his
destination was Aden, Yemen, at the southern tip of the Arabian
peninsula. Yemen is among a handful of countries supporting Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The embargo, imposed two weeks after the invasion, cover trade
from Iraq and en route to the nation.
   The slow-moving vessel was first intercepted as it sailed
southward toward the Strait of Hormuz, linking the Persian Gulf and
the Gulf of Oman.
   The ship's master agreed to return to Iraq after the piping and
plywood was discovered, but the vessel resumed its course when the
boarding party left, the Navy spokesman said.
   The vessel refused orders to stop, and the destroyer fired three
volleys across its bow on Sunday. Van Sickle said the 7,800-ton
destroyer fired its 5-inch and 25-millimeter deck guns and
.50-caliber machine guns.
   Shadowed overnight by the Italian frigate Libeccio as it passed
through the strait, the Iraqi ship stopped again when challenged in
the Gulf of Oman by the American frigate USS Reasoner and the
Australian missile frigate HMAS Adelaide, van Sickle said.
   Fifteen men from the Adelaide and 11 from the Reasoner were
dispatched and ``thoroughly searched the ship and found no
prohibited cargo,'' van Sickle said.
   U.S. officers said they did not know the Iraqi captain's reason
for defying the order to return to Iraq or divert to another port.
   ``Maybe it was because he knows what would happen to him if he
did go back,'' said one officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Reasoner and Adelaide have been operating in the Gulf of
Oman and north Arabian Sea the past month as members of the
multinational fleet enforcing the U.N. embargo.
   About 12 nations have sent ships to the region.
   According to the U.S. military, more than 2,500 commercial ships
have been challenged, 250 boarded and about a dozen diverted on
grounds their cargo was Iraq-related.
   U.S. warships had a role in 191 of the boardings. The British,
Australian, Spanish and Greek navies have also participated.

   Nebraska's state treasurer was charged
Monday with theft by deception for allegedly misusing state phones.
   The felony charge alleges Treasurer Frank Marsh used a state
credit card to make more than $300 worth of personal phone calls,
said Lancaster County Attorney Mike Heavican. If convicted, Marsh
could face up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Marsh, a Republican seeking a fourth term, also was charged with
a misdemeanor filed jointly by the prosecutor and the state
accountability commission, said Heavican.
   Reached at his home Monday, Marsh said he was unaware of the
charges and declined to comment on them or on whether he would
resign.
   The Democratic candidates for auditor and treasurer last month
accused Marsh of using state phones for personal calls.
   The next day, Marsh reimbursed the state $1,663 for calls he
said might be in question and authorities began an investigation.
   ``The voters in Nebraska are due an apology for this mistake in
judgment,'' Marsh said then.
   He said many of the calls were business-related. He said he made
monthly estimates of his personal calls and offset the costs by
using his own car for state business, purchasing gasoline and
stamps with his own money, and buying miscellaneous office
supplies. However, he kept no records of such reimbursement.
   ``I'm glad that they were able to complete part of the
investigation before the election,'' said Dawn Rockey, Democratic
candidate for treasurer.
   ``It's important for the voters to understand the gravity of the
situation. The voters will decide if the public trust has been
violated,'' she said.
   John Breslow, Democratic candidate for auditor, joined with Ms.
Rockey in bringing up the issue, and noted that an audit by
Republican Ray A.C. Johnson of the treasurer's office did not find
the questionable calls.
   State Republican Party Chairman Norm Riffel declined comment, as
did Gov. Kay Orr and Attorney General Robert Spire, both
Republicans.
   The misdemeanor under the statutes of the state Political
Accountability and Disclosure Commission deals ``with a specific
phone call made for his own personal gain,'' Heavican said. It is
punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine.
   ``I think it's safe to say there are further investigatory
things to be done, but I don't want to speculate further on that,''
Heavican said in response to a question of possible further
charges.
   Marsh, 66, has said that, if re-elected in November, it will be
his last term. The former secretary of state and lieutenant
governor was first elected treasurer in 1975. He served until 1981
when he resigned to become state director of the Farmers Home
Administration, then was elected treasurer again in 1986.

<HEAD>Nepal's Government Accepts Changes in Draft Constitution</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai
on Monday said the government has accepted ``certain changes''
proposed by King Birendra in this kingdom's constitution.
   But the prime minister refused to say if the concessions
included Birendra's key demand that the monarchy share sovereignty
with the people and retain emergency powers.
   The Cabinet has ``acceded to certain changes suggested by the
palace, but all other clauses in the draft constitution would be
kept intact,'' Bhattarai told reporters before he entered the
palace to present the draft constitution.
   Birendra earlier rejected a draft constitution approved by
Bhattarai's Cabinet that seeks to make him a constitutional
monarch.
   Instead, he submitted amendments, prompting Bhattarai to say he
would rather resign than accept the king's draft, which he said
were against his political and moral beliefs.
   Asked if he had changed his mind about resigning, Bhattarai said
``not so far,'' indicating the Cabinet's changes did not include
Birendra's main demands.
   The king had bowed to pro-democracy demonstrations and yielded
his absolute power last April after a mass people's uprising and a
subsequent police crackdown that left at least 200 people dead.
   ``I am going to the palace to request the king to accept the
draft constitution submitted by the government,'' Bhattarai said
after a three-hour Cabinet meeting. He refused to elaborate.
   ``We will inform you when the time comes,'' he said.
   But Health Minister Mathura Prasad Shrestha described the king's
draft as ``illegal,'' saying, ``We will accept only certain changes
provided they are not against the fundamental spirit of the
constitution.''
   Earlier Monday, the palace issued a statement that it had ``no
knowledge of the prime minister having any wish to resign.'' It
said the king would deal with all issues of national importance
with the advice and knowledge of the prime minister.
   The official Gorkhapatra newspaper repoted Monday that
Bhattarai has informed the king's chief secretary, Rebati Raman
Khanal, that he could not have the king's draft approved by the
Cabinet or by his Nepali Congress Party. Therefore, it had no
chance of being accepted by the people.
   Birendra's amended draft would reserve the king's right to
exercise emergency powers in case of threat to the country's
sovereignty, economic distress, failure of the constitutional
organs or external threats to the country.
   ``This is a serious point under which the king can stage a
comeback under the smallest pretext,'' said a Nepali Congress party
official who did not want to be further identified.
   Party General Secretary Girija Prasad Koirala said ``the king
should fulfil his historic responsibility by promulgating the
constitution before the people waiting for a democratic
constitution lose their patience.''

<HEAD>ANC Recommends Mandela-Buthelezi Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
recommended Monday that Nelson Mandela meet rival black leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, a breakthrough that could help ease the
violence in black townships.
   The ANC proposed a meeting between itself and Buthelezi's
conservative Inkatha Freedom Party ``in the near future,'' but did
not specify a date. The ANC statement said both Mandela and
Buthelezi should attend.
   Buthelezi said he welcomed the offer and was ready to consider a
suitable time and place for the talks.
   Mandela is in Australia and will be traveling throughout Asia
until early November.
   Since his release from prison in February, Mandela has turned
down invitations from his old friend Buthelezi despite the ongoing
violence between their supporters in the eastern province of Natal
and in black areas outside Johannesburg.
   ANC leaders have harshly briticized Buthelezi and accused him of
orchestrating the violence to obtain a meeting with Mandela and
enhance his stature.
   Buthelezi has denied the charge and accused the ANC of trying to
destroy all rivals.
   The ANC was conciliatory in its statement Monday.
   The group said ``it welcomed the steps being taken jointly by
the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party'' to stop the violence.
   The two sides have been holding periodic peace talks, but
neither Mandela nor Buthelezi has attended.
   About 5,000 blacks have died in the ANC-Inkatha power struggle
since 1986 in Natal Province. The fighting spread to the
Johannesburg area in August and has claimed 800 lives.
   The ANC and Inkatha, the two largest black opposition movements,
both oppose apartheid but differ over tactics and a future South
Africa.
   The socialist-oriented ANC has employed boycotts, strikes,
protests and waged an armed struggle, recently suspended, in its
battle against the government.
   Inkatha does not endorse any of those measures and favors
capitalism.
   The ANC draws support across tribal lines, while virtually all
Inkatha members are Zulus.
   The ANC also has opposed Buthelezi's role as leader of the
KwaZulu homeland in Natal Province. The ANC considers the 10 black
homelands part of the apartheid system. Buthelezi, meanwhile, sees
the limited self-government in the homelands as an interim step on
the road to black majority rule.

   ``Henry &amp; June,'' the sexually charged film
that earned the first NC-17 movie rating, is generating vigorous
business at the nation's theaters.
   ``Henry &amp; June'' has been playing for three weeks in limited
release. Last weekend, it grossed $1.2 million in 212 movie houses,
Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. said Monday.
   That placed it 12th on the box-office charts. To date, the
Universal Pictures release has made $4.6 million, a considerable
return for a production not aimed at teen-age audiences.
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said director Philip Kaufman. ``When you
make a film, you have hopes there will be an audience for it. ...
There are not enough adult movies for people to see.''
   The film, a story of a menage a trois that earned the new
no-children rating for a lesbian love scene and a shot of an erotic
drawing, is based on the diaries of writer Anais Nin. Starring Fred
Ward, Uma Thurman and Maria de Medeiros, it was originally rated X.
   Kaufman said the ratings flap may have helped the film but
maintained that wasn't solely responsible for its strong
performance. The film is promoted in some advertisements with the
line, ``Completely uncut in its original version.''
   ``It obviously has good word of mouth and it got some good
reviews,'' Kaufman said in a telephone interview from San
Francisco. ``We might have had better reviews without the
controversy - some people say it isn't sexy enough.''
   Kaufman noted that the recent Spanish film ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me
Down!'' originally was given the X rating, too, but didn't perform
well at movie theaters. ``So you cannot say the controversy worked
for it,'' he said.
   Kaufman and Universal both felt ``Henry &amp; June'' deserved the
less-harsh R rating, rather than the X originally given it by the
Motion Picture Association of America.
   When the MPAA announced Sept. 26 that it would replace the X
with NC-17, which excludes children under 17, Kaufman and Universal
canceled their appeal of ``Henry &amp; June's'' X rating and accepted
the new classification.
   Many newspapers and hundreds of television and radio stations
reject advertisements for movies rated X. Filmmakers said that the
X mark was synonymous with hard-core pornography, and the NC-17 was
created to resolve that economic impasse.
   ``Henry &amp; June'' was pulled from one theater in Dedham, Mass.,
when two civic leaders protested its exhibition to the theater
owner. Newspapers in Sacramento and in Birmingham, Ala., have
refused to run advertisements for NC-17 rated films.

<HEAD>U.N. Ships 19,000 Tons of Wheat To Famine-Threatened Sudan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.N. World Food Program on Monday said
it had delivered 19,000 tons of wheat to Sudan where severe drought
has threatened millions of people with famine.
   The total food needs in the vast, impoverished nation are not
yet known as a full crop assessment will not be completed until the
end of November, the Rome-based organization said in a news
release.
   However, the United Nations has said 1 million tons of relief
supplies may be needed.
   As an interim measure, the government of Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir has requested 75,000 metric tons of food for emergency
distribution to 2.4 million people in northern Sudan.
   Relief workers in Sudan say the country is facing a situation
potentially as bad as a devastating famine that wasted much of the
country in the mid-1980s and killed at least 250,000 people.
   The World Food Program said the wheat at Port Sudan will be used
for 800,000 people in the Red Sea province of eastern Sudan, in the
western regions of Kordofan and Darfur as well as the country's
central El Butana region.
   It is part of a preliminary emergency allocation of 25,000
metric tons to be supplied for immediate drought relief, WFP said
in the release sent by Telex to news organizations in Nairobi.

   The House voted Monday to spend $52.2 billion
on farming, nutrition and rural development programs, including a
half-million dollars to renovate the former home of retired
bandleader Lawrence Welk and build nearby tourist accommodations.
   By voice vote, the House accepted compromises worked out by a
House-Senate conference committee on the fiscal 1991 appropriations
bill that pays for farm subsidies and most Agriculture Department
functions, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.
   Among the $14.1 billion for rural development projects is
$500,000 for Strasburg, N.D., the birthplace of Lawrence Welk.
   ``That's right `Ah one, ah two, ah three, ah four, ah half a
million dollars,'' said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass., mimicking the
way Welk used to direct his orchestra.
   The money was included in the bill by the Senate to help
revitalize the 700-population community in the south central part
of the state. But Conte and Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., both
conference committee members, went on record as opposing the
appropriation before signing the compromise bill.
   It's money is to be used by Welk Heritage Inc. and the Strasburg
Economic Development Corp. to renovate the Welk family home and
help build a motel and other facilities to accommodate the tourist
trade that is beginning to develop around the bandleader's former
residence.
   Many rural communities where farms have been consolidated over
the years, causing a loss of economic base, are looking to the
government for help to develop other businesses.
   About half the money in the bill, $27.6 billion, goes for food
programs, including $19 billion for food stamps and $2.5 billion
for the Women, Infant and Children program, said Appropriations
Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.
   Food donations, the special milk program and child nutrition
programs also are covered by the bill.
   The bill appropriates $5 billion for farm subsidies this year
and continues the crop insurance program which Whitten had stripped
from the original House bill.
   ``Since 1980 the (crop insurance) program has lost over $2.6
billion in indemnity payments,'' said Whitten. ``Administration in
the past 10 years increased over $2 billion, an increase of over
450 percent.''
   But, at the urging of the Senate, he agreed to allow the program
to continue under certain conditions, including the Agriculture
Department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service
taking control over policy sales and loss adjustments.
   The service had controlled the program before 1980 when it was
expanded to allow private insurance companies to issue policies to
farmers. The practice became costly because the private companies
were reimbursed by the government for administrative expenses and
operating losses.
   Other specific agencies and their appropriations included:
   -Farmers Home Administration, $11.5 billion
   -Rural Electrification Administration, $334.6 million.
   -Soil Conservation Service, $771.3 million.
   -Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service, $1.5
billion.
   -International programs, including food giveaways, $1.1 billion.
   -Food and Drug Administration, $824 million.

   A teen-ager who pretended to hang from a
gallows as part of a Halloween hayride died while performing the
stunt over the weekend.
   Hayride customers found the body of Brian Jewell, 17, about 8
p.m. Saturday, hanging from the gallows, his feet on the ground.
   The the stunt had worked other nights and there was no
indication of foul play, Prosecutor James W. Holzapfel said. The
gallows was being checked for flaws and an autopsy was performed
Monday.
   ``The way it's supposed to work is he's supposed to have the
noose around his neck, but it's not a noose that tightens,'' said
Holzapfel.
   Jewell would step down about one foot to the ground, making it
appear he had been hanged, Holzapfel said.
   During the ride, about 40 people sit in a hay-filled wagon drawn
by a tractor, which takes them past a number of Halloween fright
exhibits.
   The stunt went off without problems earlier Saturday. But the
tractor driver became concerned later that evening when Jewell
failed to give the speech he normally did as the wagon passed.
   Preliminary autopsy results were expected Tuesday, said Lt.
Michael R. Murray of the prosecutor's office. Blood tests for drugs
would take several weeks, Murray said.
  The hayride, which had been conducted every night this month,
was suspended after the death of Jewell, a junior at Tom's River
High School in southern New Jersey.
   Telephone calls placed to Haunted Hayrides Inc., based outside
Syracuse, N.Y., were not immediately returned.
   An attorney representing the Lakewood Riding Center, where the
ride was held, said his client had nothing to do with the Haunted
Hayrides operation.

<HEAD>Argentine Rebel Writes Letter to President, Gets 60 Days' Arrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A renegade colonel who led a 1988
barracks revolt was arrested Monday for insubordination because of
a letter he wrote to President Carlos Menem.
   Army chief Gen. Martin Bonnet sentenced former Col. Momahed Ali
Seineldin to 60 days at the Fourth Army Corps base in La Pampa, 391
miles southwest of Buenos Aires.
   ``I can't give details,'' Seineldin said. ``Tonight, I leave for
La Pampa.''
   The cause of his arrest was a 5-page letter Seineldin delivered
Saturday to the presidential compound at Olivos, a Buenos Aires
suburb, while Menem was in Europe on a state visit.
   The letter said ``the state of unrest'' among officers and
commissioned troops could lead to ``extremely dangerous''
incidents.
   But military officials and politicians have discounted the
possibility of another revolt like the three that occurred between
April 1987 and December 1988, undermining the government of former
President Raul Alfonsin, Menem's predecessor.
   Seineldin's letter instead was considered insubordination.
   Defense Minister Humberto Romero said Seineldin's statements and
arrest ``in no way ... can find an echo in the rest of that armed
service.''
   Vice President Eduardo Duhalde said, ``It seems that certain
sectors would take advantage of the absence of the president to
take ... liberties.''
   He ordered Bonnet give Seineldin the harshest sanction
applicable - 60 days arrest - for an officer who violates the
military chain of command.
   Seineldin, a 56-year-old former commando, led a hard-line group
within the army that opposed the trials of fellow officers for
human rights abuses committed in the 1976-83 regime's crackdown on
alleged leftist subversives.
   At least 9,000 Argentines disappeared during the military's
``dirty war'' against suspected subversives and are presumed dead.
   During Seineldin's 4-day uprising in December 1988, he demanded
the army budget be increased and top generals replaced. According
to Seineldin, then army chief Gen. Jose Caridi agreed to the
demands, then reneged.
   Seineldin said he was prompted to write to Menem because
officers who agree with him are being denied promotion, the army
budget still is inadequate, and the shake-up in the military
hierarchy never took place.
   ``I consider it a duty to tell the commander-in-chief of the
armed forces about something I believe is extremely dangerous for
the future of the armed forces and the Argentine nation,'' he said
in the letter.
   Seineldin and cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico, who led the first
two uprisings in April 1987 and January 1988, both insist they are
soldiers who want to return to uniform.
   Both have held public meetings and rallies this year in an
apparent attempt to mobilize political dissent that stems from
chronic economic problems and Menem's plan to sell money-losing
state enterprises many Argentines consider the national patrimony.
   Rico is a minor-party candidate for governor of Buenos Aires
Province, the country's most populous, in elections set for
November 1991.
   Spokesmen for Seineldin distributed the Menem letter Saturday to
reporters and asked them to cover his probable arrest on Monday.

<HEAD>Bush Vetoes Major Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush vetoed a major civil rights
bill Monday and seemed assured of winning a battle in Congress to
override him. Bush argued that the bill before him would force
employers to adopt hiring quotas, a position disputed by backers of
the measure.
   The president called on lawmakers to enact his version of the
measure before they quit for the year, probably later this week.
However, that appeared unlikely, as Bush's critics said his
proposal would weaken current law.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the chief Senate sponsor,
called the veto ``tragic and disgraceful.''
   ``When the chips are down, the White House is against civil
rights,'' Kennedy said. He urged Congress to override the
president.
   Ralph G. Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, said Bush's veto ``will victimize his presidency
forever. He joins Andrew Johnson and Ronald Reagan as the only
presidents to veto a civil rights bill.''
   The bill was passed by the Senate 62-34 and by the House 273-154
- strong majorities, but not reaching the two-thirds required to
override a veto.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., the prime House sponsor,
said he would not even ask for an override vote without the
two-thirds needed by supporters. ``I'm just not going to waste any
more time,'' Hawkins said, adding that civil rights forces might
even lose support in an override fight.
   In his veto message, Bush said, ``The temptation to support a
bill - any bill - simply because its title includes the words
`civil rights' is very strong.
   ``But when our efforts, however well-intentioned, result in
quotas, equal opportunity is not advanced but thwarted,'' he said.
``The very commitment to justice and equality that is offered as
the reason why this bill should be signed requires me to veto it.''
   He said, ``I deeply regret having to take this action with a
bill bearing such a title, especially since it contains certain
provisions that I strongly endorse.''
   The measure would nullify six Supreme Court decisions that have
made it more difficult for women and minorities to prove and win
job discrimination suits. It would ban racial harassment in the
workplace and allow punitive damages in the most serious
discrimination cases.
   Bush said there were many similarities between the bill he
vetoed and the version that the administration supports, offered at
the last minute to ease the veto.
   Civil rights advocates denounced the latest version of Bush's
bill as a sham for permitting challenged hiring practices to stand
if they could be justified on such grounds as ``customer
relations,'' justifications they said were used to support the
separate-but-equal ``Jim Crow'' laws of the first half of the 20th
century that kept blacks in segregation.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, called Bush's bill
``a tired rehash of policies considered and rejected by the
Congress. ... We have nearly compromised this bill to death.''
   Summing up his key argument, Bush said, ``Despite the use of the
term `civil rights' in the title ... the bill actually employs a
maze of highly legalistic language to introduce the destructive
force of quotas into our nation's employment system.''
   He said that under Congress' bill, ``employers will be driven to
adopt quotas in order to avoid liability.''
   Bush said legal experts disagree over how to interpret important
sections of the bill. He said that was a sure sign that the vetoed
bill would have led ``to years, perhaps decades, of uncertainly and
expensive litigation.''
   Ron Brown, Democratic national chairman, said: ``The issue for
the president isn't quotas - it's politics. George Bush got to the
White House by pandering to fear ... Today he chose Willie Horton
over Abraham Lincoln.'' Horton was the convicted murderer featured
prominently in Bush campaign ads in 1988.
   In a last-minute appeal, black activist Dick Gregory marched in
front of the White House on Monday carrying a sign that read:
   ``Mr. President, before you veto the civil rights bill, please
think about the number of black African Americans you have sent to
the Persian Gulf willing to die for someone else's human rights.''
   The president's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said earlier he
believed Congress could not override the veto.
   ``There are a lot of members of Congress who believe, as we do,
that there can be a better bill,'' Fitzwater said. ``I think
everybody wants a good civil rights bill.''
   Despite the odds favoring Bush, Neas predicted a close override
vote and said civil rights advocates would push through a bill
early next year if they lose this time.
   ``It's only a matter of time,'' he said. ``The question is not
if there's going to be a civil rights act, but when.''
   Arthur Fletcher, head of the Civil Rights Commission, said the
panel disagreed with Bush's stand.
   Tensions between the White House and civil rights supporters
were reflected in the sharp language used by Fitzwater against
Bush's critics.
   ``I think they are being unfair,'' Fitzwater said. ``A lot of
them don't understand the legal implications of the bill.''
   Fitzwater said the veto would not undermine Bush's campaign to
improve his standing among blacks.
   ``I think they (blacks) understand that we want a good civil
rights bill and they don't want a quota bill, either,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Bush's bill was very similar to the measure
adopted by Congress.
   ``The only difference is that our bill does not include the
language that we believe has the effect of forcing quotas,'' he
said.
   A key dispute has been language that would help those filing
discrimination suits and make it more difficult for employers to
defend themselves. Bush says those provisions are so stringent that
companies would adopt quotas to have a ready-made defense - an
argument sponsors dispute.
   Under the Supreme Court decisions at issue, a plaintiff had to
prove that the hiring practices in dispute were not the result of
business necessity. The bill would shift that burden of proof to
the defendant employer.
   The White House plan would cap at $150,000 the total damages an
employee could win in a job discrimination suit. As passed, the
bill would allow unlimited compensatory damages in some cases and
cap punitive damages at $150,000 or the total of compensatory
damages plus back pay, whichever is greater. The White House
previously had insisted on a $100,000 cap.
   The administration proposal also would allow those filing suit
to press their cases if employers could not explain their hiring
methods in legal terms.

arbitration</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A special court refused Monday to decide
whether the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway has the right to run its own
trains on a short stretch of Conrail tracks between Buffalo and
Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   ``The judges denied Conrail's petition,'' said Richard Eriksen,
clerk of the court. ``They will explain their reasons when they
issue their memorandum or opinion.''
   Conrail immediately served the D&amp;H trustee with a demand for
binding prbitration, said Laurence Z. Shiekman, a lawyer for
Conrail. He said Conrail would also assignment of trackage rights
by a bankruptcy court next month.
   The decision came only hours after lawyers for Conrail argued
that the special regional rail reorganization court has
jurisdiction because the issue dates to 1976 when the federal
government formed Conrail. The special court decides any cases
arising out of that reorganization.
   But a lawyer for the D&amp;H's bankruptcy trustee said the case
should be decided in bankruptcy court because the trackage rights
were conferred in a separate 1979 agreement.
   The approximately 15-mile stretch is key to a $25 million offer
by Canadian Pacific Ltd. to buy the ailing D&amp;H. Without access to
the Buffalo-Niagara Gateway, CP would be unable to connect the D&amp;H
with its own lines in southern Ontario.
   Canadian Pacific wants the D&amp;H system to connect Philadelphia
and New York with the Canadian interior. If CP can put all the
pieces together, it would compete directly with Conrail for freight
in the Northeast.
   The Canadian company has been operating the D&amp;H since August
under an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   Charles H. White Jr., lawyer for the bankruptcy trustee, pointed
out that Conrail chose not to object to the D&amp;H takeover in
bankruptcy court or before the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   ``It is ironically using its own statutory court to throw grave
doubt on the reorganization of its competitor,'' White said. ``I
think we can see through the thin jurisdictional arguments exactly
what's happening here.''
   Chief Judge John Minor Wisdom called the case troubling, and
asked both sides why they had never submitted the question to
binding arbitration, as required by both the 1976 and 1979
agreements. Neither side had a clear answer.
   The D&amp;H, the nation's oldest continually operated railroad,
filed in July 1988 for protection from its creditors under U.S.
bankruptcy laws. The railroad, which runs from Montreal to
Washington and between Albany and Buffalo, owes more than $100
million.
   This is the second time that Conrail has thrown up a roadblock
in CP's effort to buy the D&amp;H. Earlier this year, Conrail refused
to negotiate the rights to its tracks between Hagerstown, Md., and
Harrisburg, Pa. This led CP to withdraw its initial $35 million bid
for the D&amp;H.

<HEAD>Chilean Communists Become Legal Again After 17 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile's Communist Party on Monday emerged
from 17 years of repression and became legal again.
   The party, once one of the largest in the Western Hemisphere,
now is badly split and weakened.
   Party members joyfully paraded through the streets of downtown
Santiago as Secretary-General Volodia Teitelboim delivered 61,400
supporting signatures to the Election Board, a requirement for a
political party's legal recognition.
   But the party faces the gravest crisis in its 68 years of
existence. Leading members have resigned, unhappy with an old-guard
leadership that they said failed to accept democratic changes.
   For many years, Chilean Communists were staunchly pro-Moscow,
but local leaders did not go along as changes effected in the
Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev spread through the world
Communist movement.
   Central Committee member Luis Gustavino was expelled after he
publicly attacked the party's ``lack of internal democracy.''
Prominent members resigned, as did about 200 members of the youth
branch.
   ``We have again a legal Communist Party in Chile,'' Telteiboim
said. ``It was not easy, as the party lived for 17 years under
ferocious repression.''
   Under the 16{-year military regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
which ended in March, scores of party leaders were killed, arrested
or sent into exile.
   The party was outlawed. Other leftist parties received similar
treatment. Under Pinochet's successor, President Patricio Aylwin,
restrictions have been lifted.
   The Communist Party was a major member in the six-party
coalition supporting the leftist government of President Salvador
Allende, who died when Pinochet toppled his administration in a
bloody 1973 coup.
   The Communists were especially strong among workers and
attracted up to 16 percent of the vote in national elections.
   In last December's congressional elections, the party failed to
elect one senator or congressman. Its total vote was estimated at
2.5 percent.
   Teitelboim on Monday described the crisis within the party as
``a process of deep renovation.''

   The directive was sent to Defense Secretary Richard Cheney just
four days before Bush arrives in Hawaii for a two-night visit.
Bush's order did not offer any explanation for his decision.
   ``This directive extends to use of the island for small arms,

   The United States has paid $40 million
toward its delinquent U.N. dues of $521.9 million, giving the world
body enough cash to keep operating though November, officials said
Monday.
   The payment was made Friday, but not announced until now.
   It reduces U.S. arrears to $481.9 million - about 80 percent of
the arrears owed by all 159 member nations.
   America also owes more than $160 million to various peacekeeping
operations, which come under separate budgets.
   The United States began withholding large portions of its U.N.
dues in 1985, under President Reagan, to protest what it said was
the organization's anti-Western bias, inefficiency and budget
overruns.
   Reagan said in September 1988 he was pleased with the world
body's progress toward budget reform, trimming its staff, and its
new spirit of consensus and cooperation. He left details of paying
the arrears to his successor, President Bush.
   The administration has proposed a plan for full funding of
annual U.N. dues assessments and a repayment schedule in which
about one-fifth of the arrears would be paid each year for five
years.

<TEXT>
   Nursing home staffers and 33 residents
agreed to end a two-day standoff Monday and comply with a corporate
eviction notice that had already sent residents at two other
Florida nursing homes packing.
   ``I would have done it if I could, as well as every staff member
here,'' said acting administrator Kandi Kelly, praising staffers
who continued to provide care even though their employer said they
would not be paid.
   ``We've given our heart and soul, but there's nothing I can
do,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services officials were investigating evictions at all three
facilities to determine whether residents were given the proper
seven days' notice.
   Residents of three Village Green Centers - in Winter Haven, New
Port Richey and Tallahassee - were given a day's notice to move
Friday, when the manager, Universal Equities Inc., ordered the
homes closed because of financial problems.
   While residents of the other homes complied over the weekend,
administrators, staffers, relatives and 33 residents of the Winter
Haven home banded together to keep Universal Equities executives
off the property. Guards were posted outside the home's door.
   Ms. Kelly said she had been trying to find a ``white knight''
buyer for the home to prevent residents from moving. But with the
fight over, she said new housing arrangements would be made for the
residents.
   On the advice of attorneys, Ms. Kelly said she had no choice but
to comply with the eviction demand.
   Village Green Inc. of Winter Haven filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, said
attorney Thomas Woodward, who represents the company.
   The company is involved in litigation with First Federal Florida
Savings of Osceola, which is foreclosing on the Village Green
property, Woodward said.
   Village Green corporate officials did not immediately return
telephone calls Monday from The Associated Press.
   Administrators at the nursing home fielded hundreds of offers of
food and volunteer help, and residents passed the time inside
watching television.
   ``I'm shocked at all this, I really am,'' said resident Edna
Boddicker. ``I can't believe it.''
   ``Their life is in an uproar,'' said Robin Marshall, a certified
nursing assistant at the home. ``I don't think it's right to put
these old people out. It's time the public take a look at what's
going on with the elderly.''
   Connie Cheren, HRS' director of licensure and certification,
said residents at all three homes will be questioned to determine
whether they were given the seven days notice required by law.
   She also said HRS attorneys will ask a Polk circuit judge to
appoint a temporary receiver to supervise the Winter Haven eviction
to ensure residents are given seven days to move out.

<HEAD>Security Council Tries to Avoid U.S. Veto on Israel Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Security Council met on Monday trying
to avert a U.S. veto of a resolution that would demand Israel
cooperate with a U.N. team investigating the killing of 19
Palestinians on Temple Mount in Jerusalem.
   America, which often shields Israel with its veto, seeks a
nonbinding consensus statement to be issued by the council
president, expressing regret at Israel's refusal to cooperate with
a U.N. probe and urging it to reconsider.
   Informal consultations were suspended Monday night until
Tuesday.
   Israel has rejected any U.N. probe as an infringement on its
sovereignty. The United States has sought to avoid using its veto
power, as one of the five permanent council members empowered to
kill any measure.
   The killing of three Jews by an Arab in an apparent revenge
slaying Sunday appeared to complicate the situation and call for a
broader resolution that also would implicate the Palestinians in
violence.
   The council already has unanimously condemned the actions of
Israeli security forces in killing 19 Palestinians two weeks ago.
Members were seeking to preserve the unity of the 15-member
council.
   The United States, Britain and other Western nations want to
return the focus of the council and the international spotlight to
the issue of Iraq's aggression against Kuwait.

<HEAD>Briton Held in Iraq Dies of Heart Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 62-year-old British engineer held hostage by
Iraqi authorities has died of a heart attack, the Foreign Office
and his family said Monday.
   ``We know nothing more than the fact that he died and that a
doctor was with him at the time,'' said Ronald Duffy's widow,
Christine. ``I'm terribly shocked.''
   Duffy worked for a British company, Merz and McLellan, in Kuwait
when Iraq invaded Aug. 2.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said the Iraqi Foreign Ministry
reported Duffy's death to the British Embassy in Baghdad on Sunday,
but did not say where he died.
   Duffy, who had no history of heart trouble, worked for the
company for 26 years, mostly on foreign postings. His widow said
she received a letter from him two weeks ago saying he was well.
   He was among hundreds of Britons held at various facilities in
Iraq as part of President Saddam Hussein's policy of using Western
hostages to deter an attack, British officials said.
   Earlier Monday, the Foreign Office said Iraqi troops in Kuwait
have rounded up seven more Britons and are holding them at the
Regency Hotel in Kuwait City to await transfer to Iraq.
   ``It is illegal and deplorable, like all the others
(detained),'' said a spokesman, who requested anonymity.
   He said the men rounded up were ``almost certainly in hiding,''
but there were no details of how they were caught.
   The Foreign Office said there were 650 Britons left in Kuwait,
most in hiding, and about 800 Britons trapped in Iraq, including
340 being held at strategic locations.
   Former British Prime Minister Edward Heath said Saddam promised
on Sunday to release an unspecified number of sick or elderly
Britons.
   An aircraft from British-based Virgin Atlantic airline is
scheduled to fly to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Tuesday for
Heath and to possibly return freed hostages.
   Duffy was the third Briton to die in Iraq or Kuwait since the
invasion.
   A Scottish scientist, William Norrie Atack, 46, died in Kuwait
this month. A 45-year-old businessman, Douglas Thomas Croskery, was
shot to death in August while trying to escape from Kuwait.
   Three members of the Irish parliament were granted Iraqi visas
Monday for a November trip to Baghdad to plead for the release of
nationals trapped by the gulf crisis.
   The legislators are expected to meet Iraqi government officials,
but it was not known whether they would talk directly with Saddam.
   Ireland's Gulf Relatives Support Committee asked the legislators
to make the trip, which is not formally sanctioned by the Irish
government.

   Five gunmen held up a bus in
southwestern Panama, stripped the passengers of their belongings
and spray-painted the vehicle with the initials of a little-known
pro-Noriega group, police said Monday.
   None of the 27 people aboard the bus were hurt in Sunday's

Panama City. Police said they found the bus on a mountain road near
Nata, spray-painted with the initials M-20.
   M-20 is the acronym for the December 20 Movement, made up of
loyalists to deposed dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   It takes its name from the date last year when the United States
invaded Panama to remove Noriega, who is in Miami facing trial in

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh on Monday
appealed for a peaceful resolution to a religious site dispute that
has caused violent Hindu-Moslem clashes and could threaten the
Singh's coalition government.
   ``Religious fanaticism is the first step towards the foundation
for a theocratic state. It will be the death of India as a secular
state,'' Singh said during a 20-minute televised speech.
   At least 80 people have died this year in battles over a 16th
century mosque, the Babri Masjid, in Ayodhya, about 310 miles east
of New Delhi.
   Hindus believe the town was the birthplace of a god, Rama, and
want to dismantle the mosque, claiming it was built by Mogul rulers
on the foundations of an ancient Hindu temple.
   The Hindu World Council has vowed to start rebuilding the temple
Oct. 30, but a Moslem group had said it will protect the mosque.
Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people. Moslems
account for 12 percent.
   Singh said he has appointed five state chief ministers to help
``solve the issue.'' Chief ministers are the highest elected
officials of a state.
   He also asked the Hindu fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party to
work toward a nonviolent solution.
   There was no immediate reaction from the Bharatiya Janata, or
Indian People's Party. Several other political parties and groups
have unsuccessfully appealed to the party to call off its campaign.
   Singh's 10-month-old National Front coalition government needs
the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Left Front, a conglomeration of
communist groups, to remain intact.
   The Bharatiya Janata Party has threatened to withdraw support
from the government if the proposed temple construction is
disrupted.
   ``How can a country be governed in circumstances like this? Is
it necessary that the country has to be plunged into communal
chaos? Can't they wait to build the temple until a peaceful
settlement has been reached?'' asked Singh, whose Janata Dal party
comprises the largest part of the coalition government.
   ``Hundreds of governments can come and go but the nation should
remain one,'' he said. ``Government is too small a consideration
when people are involved.''
   Clashes between the Moslems and Hindus escalated last month
after Bharatiya Janata Party leader Lal Krishna Advani set off on a
6,000-mile van journey from a west Indian Hindu shrine to Ayodhya.
   Advani is scheduled to reach Ayodhya on Oct. 30. Authorities in
Uttar Pradesh state have said they may arrest Advani when he
crosses the state border.
   Fearing unrest, police already have detained more than 20,000
Hindu activists. Many road and rail links to Ayodhya have been
blocked or subject to stringent checks.

<HEAD>Communist Leader Voted Out of Czechoslovak Parliament Presidium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party chairman Vasil
Mohorita on Monday was voted out of the Presidium, the highest
parliamentary body, by legislators in the lower house, the state
news agency CTK reported.
   The agency gave no reason for the ouster, but Mohorita's recent
attack on planned government reforms stirred anti-Communist
protests around the country.
   The reforms are aimed at dismantling structures left by four
decades of Communist Party rule and introducing a market economy.
   Legislators in the House of the People, the lower chamber of the
300-seat, two-house national assembly, voted 117-86 to replace
Mohorita, CTK said.
   Although no longer one of the 40 members of the Presidium, he
will remain a deputy in the lower house. The Presidium, made up of
deputies from both houses, can pass legislation when Parliament is
not in session.
   In a speech published two weeks ago, Mohirita said high
unemployment and inflation, probable side-effects of reforms, were
unacceptable and urged ``a hard and uncompromising struggle.''
   Also on Monday, President Vaclav Havel renewed his call for
abolition of the Warsaw Pact as an ``outdated tool of Stalinist
expansion.''
   He said over state radio that Czechoslovakia would reiterate its
proposal to abolish the pact's joint military command at a summit
meeting of the military alliance in Budapest Nov. 3-4.
   The summit is to determine the future of the Warsaw Pact, formed
in 1955 as the Soviet bloc's answer to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   In a bid to reform Czechoslovakia's army and break from its
Communist past, Havel last week dismissed Defense Minister Gen.
Miroslav Vacek and appointed a civilian, Lubos Dobrovsky in his
place.
   CTK also reported that Miroslav Stepan, former Communist Party
chief in Prague, was sentenced Monday to 2{ years in prison for
abuse of power after appealing a four-year sentence.
   He was convicted of ordering the use of water cannon and tear
gas against demonstrators on Oct. 28, 1988.
   The appeals court ruled his guilt in ordering the use of force
in January 1989 against anti-Communist demonstrators in Prague
could not be established. Stepan was a hard-liner against
dissidents before the Communists were ousted in Czechoslovakia's
peaceful November 1989 revolution.

<TEXT>
   A jury was seated Monday in the trial
of Arkansas Attorney General Steve Clark, who is accused of using
his state-issued Visa credit card to entertain friends, family and
political supporters.
   The allegations in February forced Clark to give up his
candidacy for the Democratic nomination for governor, improving
Gov. Bill Clinton's re-election chances.
   The 43-year-old Democrat, the state's top legal officer since
1979, is charged with one count of felony theft by deception. If
convicted, he could be sentenced to 20 years in prison and could be
fined $15,000.
   During jury selection, Clark's attorney, Bill Bristow, quizzed
potential jurors on their attitudes toward politicians and lawyers,
and on whether they had expense accounts and how they spent the
money.
   Bristow said his client had two strikes against him.
   ``One of the problems I've got with this case is my client is a
lawyer,'' he said. ``Lots of people don't like lawyers. My client
is also a politician, and I've heard people say they don't care
much for politicians. The fact that my client is a lawyer and a
politician, does that create any problem?''
   A pool of 96 prospective jurors was called for questioning. Two
pool members were dismissed because of their association with
Clark.
   Pulaski County Circuit Judge Perry V. Whitmore said the trial
would begin Tuesday. The jury of 10 women and two men included a
meat cutter, an Army National guardswoman and an electronic
technician for AT&amp;T.
   Clark said he was glad the trial was under way so he could ``get
a chance to tell my side.'' He declined to say whether he planned
to take the stand.
   Bristow pointed out that prosecutor Chris Piazza is running for
Whitmore's seat on Nov. 6. He also noted that the allegations
surfaced about nine days after Clark announced his plans to run for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
   Clark is accused of improperly billing taxpayers at least
$8,448.27 on his credit card for meals 56 times from 1986 to 1989.
The amount included $2,012.38 for tips and alcohol. State law
prohibits the purchase of alcohol on state expense accounts.
   He reported as business expenditures meals with people who say
they didn't eat with him or that it wasn't business. Some who ate
with him said they paid the tab.
   After the allegations arose, Clark reimbursed the state
$3,951.29. He blamed poor record-keeping and said records of the
meetings were reconstructed from notes, his calendar, receipts or
memory every two to three months.
   Piazza has said he will show Clark spent state money in part to
entertain political supporters. Money contributed to Clark's
campaign ended up in his habitually-overdrawn checking account,
Piazza has said.

<HEAD>Officials Confirm Asian-Strain Citrus Canker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts confirmed that a canker
infecting more than 200 citrus trees in this citrus-rich state is
the highly malignant Asian strain, the state agriculture department
said Monday.
   At least 214 trees in a three-block area of the commercial grove
in Highlands County will be removed while authorities determine how
to prevent further damage, a department spokeswoman said.
   Citrus is a leading crop in Florida, generating about $1.5
billion annually. The virulent bacerial disease causes citrus trees
to drop their fruit.
   The affected 400-acre grove is near Central Florida's Lake
Placid, about 30 miles northwest of Lake Okeechobee. It contains
about 70,000 trees.
   ``We're sure it can be contained,'' said Maeve McConnell,
information specialist for the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services. ``We've had good success on Florida's west
coast where we've found it before.''
   Removal and defoliation could also protect neighboring trees,
Ms. McConnell said.
   A 1984 outbreak of what at first appeared to be the Asian strain
prompted authorities to burn 20 million citrus trees. Scientists
later determined the strain was not a threat to commercial citrus.

   Congress took a first step Monday to require
colleges to tell prospective students how many athletes graduate
and how much crime there is on campus as well as how many football
titles and Nobel Prize winners it has.
   By voice vote, the House approved a bill requiring colleges and
universities that receive federal financial aid and grant athletic
scholarships to provide graduation data to the Education
Department.
   Academic institutions receiving federal student aid also must
disclose to students and employees campus security policies and
crime statistics.
   The bill was produced by a conference committee of the House and
Senate that ironed out differences in versions passed by each
House. The Senate must approve before the bill can go to the
president.
   ``Choosing which college or university to attend is a difficult
decision for parents and students,'' said Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., chairman of the Education and Labor subcommittee on
post-secondary education.
   ``Surely they deserve as much information as possible.''
   Under the bill, academic institutions must provide an annual
report to the Education Department, starting in 1992, on how many
students receive athletic scholarships and the graduation rate by
race and sex for students on football and basketball scholarships.
   In addition, colleges and universities must provide the
graduation rate for all students as well as the rate for students
on other athletic scholarships, including baseball, track and all
other sports combined.
   When a student is offered an athletic scholarship, the college
must provide the information to the student, parents, coach and
guidance counselor.
   The provisions on crime awareness and campus security take
effect on Sept. 1, 1991 and require the college to provide
statistics on crimes that have occurred during the past three
school years, including murder, rape and robbery.
   The college also must report the number of arrests for liquor
law violations, drug abuse and weapons possession.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began Monday in the
trial of a man whose daughter has accused him of molesting and
murdering her young playmate 21 years ago.
   The crimes resurfaced last November when the man's daughter told
investigators she suddenly had remembered she saw her father
sexually attack, then kill, her best friend when she was 8 years
old.
   Jury selection in the trial of George Franklin Sr. is expected
to take up to two weeks, said Judge Thomas McGinn. Franklin faces a
possible life sentence if convicted.
   Eileen Franklin-Lipsker testified during a preliminary hearing
in May that she repressed her memory of the crimes for 20 years
because her father had threatened to kill her if she told anyone.
   But she said she began having vivid flashbacks of the crimes in
early 1989.
   Franklin, 51, a retired firefighter, was arrested last November
at his apartment near Sacramento. He has pleaded innocent and is
being held on $2 million bail in San Mateo County jail.
   Susan Nason, 8, of Foster City, disappeared on Sept. 22, 1969.
Her decomposing remains were found in a remote area three months
later.
   A pathologist found she was killed by two blows to the head.
   Ms. Franklin-Lipsker was not questioned about the murder at the
time.

   A high-level delegation of Angolan Roman
Catholic Church leaders visited the headquarters of guerrillas
fighting the Marxist government, rebel radio reported Monday.
   A government official confirmed the visit and said the
government approved of the bishops' peace visit to the rebel camp.
   The delegation was headed by the Most Rev. Franklin Costa
Fernandes, archbishop of the southern city of Lubango and president
of the Angolan Episcopal Conference.
   Costa Fernandes was joined by two other bishops on his visit to
Jamba, the southeastern stronghold of the U.S.-backed UNITA
guerrillas, said the rebels' Voice of the Black Cockerel radio
station.
   In another development, the government began returning property
confiscated from the church after Angola's independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   A prestigious religious education center in Luanda was handed
back to church authorities Friday, 13 years after its was
expropriated.
   Almost half Angola's 9.4 million people are Roman Catholics.
   The Portuguese government has mediated at four meetings between
the two sides since April.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi said recently a cease-fire in the
conflict could be signed before the end of the year.
   Portuguese officials say the two sides have reached broad
agreement on the adoption of multiparty democracy and human rights.
   But there were several reports of fighting in Angola this week.
   An Monday army statement said rebels killed 150 civilians in the
southern province of Huila the past 35 days, including 12
officials.
   The official ANGOP news agency reported Monday 12 rebels were
slain Wednesday by government troops in Huila.
   The rebels from the the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, or UNITA, have been fighting the
Soviet-backed government since Angola's independence in 1975.
   According to government figures, 350,000 people have died as a
result of the fighting.

   A militant teachers federation
on Monday blamed the Salvadoran army for complicity in the
strangling of a teacher in a small western town.
   Teacher Vilma Chavez, 42, was found strangled with a broken neck
Sunday night at her home in Colon, 25 miles west of San Salvador,
according to police reports.
   ``The colleague's murder corresponds to the accusations to which
we have been subjected by President (Alfredo) Cristiani and the
armed forces, who say that our labor activities are part of
guerrilla plans,'' said Saul Sanchez, a leader of the National
Salvadoran Educators Association.
   Chavez was a leader of the association, which traditionally has
been critical of the Salvadoran government and has stepped up
protests against the Cristiani administration in recent months.
   The administration last week issued a statement saying that
``some organizations of well-known political affiliation are
developing a plan of social agitation and tension-building that
coincides with plans the leadership of the FMLN's leadership has
reiterated.''
   The FMLN is the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, a
rebel force that has been fighting a series of U.S.-backed
administrations in an 1l-year-old civil war.
   The Cristiani administration contended in recent days that ``the
use of arguments and demands that are impossible to meet by some
leaders who are promoting strikes, work stoppages and street
demonstrations confirms that these are political not labor
movements.''
   Sanchez, in an interview, said that ``with these accusations
they are condemning to death all teachers and all colleagues who
demand better living conditions.''
   The Salvadoran war has claimed an estimated 72,000 lives, most
of them civilian. Human rights groups say as many as 30,000 deaths
have been at the hands of right-wing death squads.
   Authorities on Monday charged five people - among them one
teacher add three university students - with participating in a
guerrilla attack on air force headquarters in San Salvador on
Wednesday.
   Judge Raul Armado Diaz said the five are accused of being
members of the Armed Forces of Liberation, one of five military
organizations that make up the FMLN.
   He said authorities seized Chinese-made rocket launchers from
the group members.
   He identified the arrested as University of El Salvador students
Jeny Ereli Lemus, Silvia Yanira Hernandez, Edith Emilia Gomez,
physical education teacher Omar Eriberto Quintanilla and
businessman Salvador Portillo.

<TEXT>
   Two labor leaders were killed Monday
hours before militant unions announced plans for a nationwide
general strike to demand wage increases.
   Military officials ordered armed escorts on buses in the wake of
both attacks, which came one day after Communist rebels burned two
buses in the Philippine capital of Manila in support of the strike.
   Police said Oscar Lazaro, 53, chief of an association of
passenger Jeep drivers, was slain by at least four gunmen who
entered his office in suburban Paranaque.
   In a separate incident, a lone assailant fatally stabbed Adriano
Yumul, president of the Metro Port Worker's Union, as he was
walking to a bus stop in central Manila.
   Police were uncertain if the attacks were strike-related.
   Lazaro's association had not announced whether it would join in
Wednesday's threatened strike, called to demand a pay increase of
$1.50 a day for all workers. President Corazon Aquino has called
the proposed pay hike excessive.
   Lazaro's group refused to join a transport strike two weeks ago
and had not supported protests called by more militant unions.
   During a press conference after the killings, leaders of the
Labor Advisory Consultative Council, which claims 1.5 million
members, announced plans for the strike unless the government meets
pay raise demands by noon Tuesday.
   ``The workers have run out of patience so we have decided to go
on with the strike,'' said council leader Fred Bentulan.
   On Sunday, rebels burned two buses in the suburbs of Makati and
Pasig after ordering passengers to disembark.
   The Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila wing of the Communist New
People's Army, said it carried out the attacks because the bus
owners were anti-labor and had pressured drivers not to join
previous strikes.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos on Monday ordered armed escorts on
buses, and additional police checkpoints were seen late Monday on
major thoroughfares.
   Last week, unions rejected a 68-cent-a-day increase, which they
called insufficient to protect workers against spiraling costs of
fuel, food and utilities.
   Early Tuesday, bombs exploded in the Manila headquarters of
Caltex Inc. and Shell Cos. of the Philippines, both of which are
seeking government approval to raise fuel prices because of the
gulf crisis and the decline of the Philippine peso. Police said no
one was reported injured in the bombings.
   In a radio address Sunday, Mrs. Aquino urged workers not to
``endanger the very existence of your employer firms by asking for
unrealistic wage increases.''
   Most national strikes called in recent years have had a limited
impact. Only about 10 percent of the work force is organized, and
the labor movement is divided.
   But military rebels in the past have sought to exploit labor
unrest to launch attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino.
   Mrs. Aquino has survived seven military revolts since she took
power in the February 1986 ``people power revolution'' that toppled
the late President Ferdinand Marcos.

   White supremacist Tom Metzger and others
must pay $12.5 million in damages to the family of a black man
beaten to death by racist ``skinheads'' Metzger is accused of
inciting, a jury ruled Monday.
   Metzger, 52, a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, was
assessed $5 million and his White Aryan Resistance was ordered to
pay $3 million in damages. His son John, 22, was must pay $1
million in damages.
   Metzger was accused in the lawsuit of inciting the murder by
sending an agent to Portland to organize skinheads and teach them
how to attack minorities.
   Metzger, a TV repairman from aallbrook, Calif., who said his
family lives on $1,200 a month, said he couldn't come close to
paying the judgment and probably would appeal.
   ``I'll be broke, and under the Constitution I can advocate
violence now and nobody can sue me anymore,'' said Metzger. ``So
all the things I'm accused of that I didn't do I can do now.''
   The jury decided that Kenneth Mieske and Kyle Brewster, two
skinheads who pleaded guilty in the slaying, must pay $500,000 each
in damages.
   The wrongful-death suit brought by the family of Mulugeta Seraw
sought $12.5 million, and the jury awarded the entire amount. It
wasn't immediately clear how the remaining $2.5 breaks down among
the defendants.
   Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian who planned to attend school in
Portland, was attacked by three racist ``skinheads'' as he returned
home from a party in November 1988. His head was split open by a
softball bat.
   ``People from this country ... have avenged my son's death for
me,'' Seraw's father, Seraw Tekuneh, said through an interpreter
after the verdict was announced. ``This is the happiest I feel
since my son died because I know he has not died in vain.''
   The lead plaintiff's attorney, Morris Dees of the Southern
Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., noted the jury awarded all
the damages he sought.
   ``Back home, we say, `It cleans his plow,' '' Dees said of the
verdict.
   ``This jury, I believe, has said there will be a new season for
justice in the Northwest and the hate and violence as preached by
Tom Metzger hopefully will be shut down forever,'' Dees said.
   Jurors deliberated about five hours before reaching the verdict
on an 11-1 vote.
   The Multnomah County Circuit jury found that the Metzgers and
White Aryan Resistance conspired to do violence to minorities and
that they were reckless in sending Dave Mazzella to Portland as
their agent.
   Metzger, who served as his own attorney, said the white
separatist movement wouldn't be deterred by the ruling.
   The verdict ``will cause the ire of a growing underclass of this
country,'' Metzger said. ``They made a fatal mistake, I believe. I
think they shot themselves in the foot and as conditions change in
the country, I think you're going to see it.''
   The Metzgers never faced criminal charges in the beating.
   Mieske pleaded guilty to murder and racial intimidation, in the
beating, Brewster to manslaughter and racial intimidation and a
third skinhead, Steven Strasser, to manslaughter.
   Three years ago, Dees won a $7 million jury verdict against the
United Klans of America after two Klansmen from Mobile, Ala.,
killed a 19-year-old black man.
   Judge Ancer Haggerty told the jury that in order to return a
verdict against the Metzgers, they must find that the Metzgers,
through their agents, substantially assisted or encouraged conduct
leading to the fatal beating.
   Metzger told jurors that if he is found liable, their own
freedoms could be eroded. As an example, he said a juror could be
sued for sending a co-worker out for coffee if that person then
held up a convenience store.
   ``Under this loose idea of agency, you're all in trouble,'' he
said.
   Metzger attacked the credibility of Dave Mazzella, 21, a former
vice president of John Metzger's Aryan Youth Movement who was the
plaintiffs' star witness.
   He contended that Mazzella lied when he said the Metzgers sent
him to Portland to stir up the local skinheads, members of East
Side White Pride. Mazzella said he since has changed his racist
ways.
   Metzger noted that other witnesses said Mazzella was the leader
of a southern Oregon skinhead group as recently as a few months
ago.
   ``Mazzella exaggerates and wants to be in the spotlight in the
center of the stage,'' he said. ``Without Dave Mazzella, there is
no case.''
   ``The only thing you're here to decide is if there was a meeting
of minds to specifically radicalize East Side White Pride and
specifically find a black person and kill him,'' Metzger said. ``If
that didn't happen, there's no case.''
   Elden Rosenthal, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said in his
rebuttal that the First Amendment wasn't the issue.
   ``We have no evidence that Tom or John Metzger said, `Go kill
Mulugeta Seraw.' We're not required to prove that,'' he told the
jury.
   He said the plaintiffs had proven that the Metzgers and Mazzella
conspired to create random acts of violence ``and the fact that in
one of those random incidents a man died, and that's why we're
here.''
   Metzger said the case is a conspiracy to destroy him. ``Do you
want to make me a martyr?'' he asked jurors.
   He also claimed he has few assets. ``In many cases I could
qualify for the poverty level,'' he said.
   Rosenthal said the plaintiffs' intent is not to become wealthy,
but to stop racist violence. The way to do that, Rosenthal said, is
to strangle it financially.
   ``This community, indeed this country, is going to remember your
verdict for a long time,'' he said.

<HEAD>N-Plant Officials Release Documents, Say Plant Will Be Safe</HEAD>

   Officials at the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant on Monday released a summary of a report critical of
management and denied that safety was being jeopardized in the rush
to restart plutonium reprocessing.
   A consulting firm, Cermak Fletcher Associates Inc. of
Gaithersburg, Md., has done a study for EG&amp;G Inc., the plant
contractor, citing serious management problems at the plant in the
last five months. The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear
weapons.
   A summary of its report, completed in August, was released
Monday after The Associated Press last week reported parts of the
document.
   Rocky Flats workers who spoke on condition of anonymity told the
AP that managers were endangering safety at the plant in a rush to
restart operations, which have been suspended since November 1989
because of safety and environmental concerns.
   The summary said the plant's civilian management team ``failed
to establish and implement a comprehensive management control
program for procedure development'' for resuming operations.
   EG&amp;G Inc. operates the plant outside Denver for the Department
of Energy. Plant officials acknowledged Monday there was a push to
get safety problems fixed at the plant, but denied there is a rush
to restart plutonium reprocessing at the expense of safety.
   ``Obviously, we'd like to get all the things fixed here that
need fixing,'' Bob Nelson, plant manager for the Department of
Energy, told a news conference. ``We have a budget and a certain
number of dollars, and we'd like to get all we can for the money.''
   Nelson denied there is a rush to restart plutonium reprocessing
at the expense of safety.
   John Davis, an assistant EG&amp;G manager who commissioned the
report, said it was ordered after he twice tried to submit
procedures for DOE approval that failed to meet federal
requirements.
   Plant officials denied the report was responsible for the firing
on Friday of plant manager Phil Warner. Warner was replaced by
James O. Zane, an EG&amp;G vice president. Plant officials said in a
statement that the company felt it was time for a change.
   Workers at the plant claimed problems are even worse than the
report indicates.
   One worker said that when he questioned whether he should
install a fire door before checking if it standards for a nuclear
plant, a supervisor ordered him to go ahead and install because
checking would take too long. The worker said he checked records
later and found it failed to meet federal standards.
   Workers also said so-called red-line drawings, which are used to
identify critical operations at the plant, were improperly drawn up
over the past six months and many will have to be redone. They said
it could cost as much as $130 million to redo the work.
   Francis Allhoff, assistant general manager for administration
and planning, acknowledged that some of the drawings will have to
be done over. But he said most could be used in resuming operations
of the plant, even though they don't meet industry standards.
   ``All of the red-line drawings may not have been done correctly.
They will have to be redone, but it's not a big number,'' he said.

   Chess champion Garry Kasparov sustained his edge
over challenger Anatoly Karpov as the two agreed to a draw Monday
in the fifth game of the world chess title match.
   Kasparov went into the game leading by 2{ points to Karpov's 1{
points.
   When the game ended just after 10 p.m. after Karpov's 36th move,
the score was 3 to 2 in Kasparov's favor.
   The champion's Game 2 victory was worth a full point. The three
other games were draws, worth one-half point each to the two
contestants.
   ``Kasparov is trying to create many problems for Karpov in each
game,'' said grand master Sergey Kudrin, of Stamford, Conn. ``Even
when they draw, Karpov has to work very hard for it.''
   Kasparov took one of his three allowed timeouts on Friday,
postponing Game 5 until Monday. Karpov had used one of his timeouts
a week earlier to recuperate from his Game 2 loss.
   The first player to reach 12{ points in the 24-game series will
win the championship. Kasparov, who dethroned Karpov in 1985, would
retain his title if the match ended in a 12-12 tie.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York and the
remainder will be played in Lyons, France.
   The winner will receive $1.7 million and the loser will get $1.3
million.

   The long-delayed sale of MGM-UA
Communications Co. neared completion Monday when Italian financier
Giancarlo Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. delivered the
balance of the $1.3 million price.
   MGM-UA's board of directors scheduled a meeting Tuesday about
the sale of the historic studio, the two companies said in a news
release. Pathe, a Beverly Hills-based entertainment conglomerate,
said if the board gives its approval, Pathe anticipates closing the
deal Friday.
   The deal was negotiated by Parretti and Kirk Kerkorian, the
financier who owns 80 percent of MGM-UA and has been trading its
various pieces for several years.
   The deal with Pathe had been hung up over concerns Parretti
wouldn't be able to come up with the money.
   Pathe paid $967 million, representing the balance of the
purchase price of MGM-UA, into an escrow account. Combined with
previous installments totalling $353 million, the payments fulfill
the purchase price.
   Of the additional $967 million, Pathe said almost $600 million
was raised through a sale of stock in the combined company. Pathe
spokesman Craig Parsons said details of the offering would be
revealed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
later this week. He declined to identify the new investors.
   Pathe on Sunday sold English-language television rights for
nearly 1,000 MGM-UA films to Turner Broadcasting System Inc. That
transaction was valued at a reported $200 million.
   MGM-UA is responsible for the Oscar-winning ``Rain Man,'' and
the James Bond and Rocky films. Its television arm makes the shows
``thirtysomething,'' ``In the Heat of the Night,'' ``The Young
Riders'' and ``Dark Shadows.''
   Over the last two years, production at the studio has slowed to
a crawl as MGM-UA has gone through a variety of aborted takeovers.
   Parretti, Pathe's co-president, is an elusive figure. The son of
a olive merchant, he made his fortune, he says, by buying,
restructuring and selling troubled European companies. He has
predicted that one day he will preside over ``the biggest film
group in the world.''
   He has been Liberia's ``ambassador at large,'' has dodged
published reports accusing him of making anti-semitic comments and
has been convicted of a fraudulent bankruptcy in a Naples court.
   Parretti bought the financially strapped Cannon Group movie
studio, purveyors of exploitation titles like ``River of Death,''
in 1988 for $200 million. Other holdings include a French
real-estate concern, European theater chains and movie production
and distribution companies.
   MGM-UA executives declined to comment on Monday's announcement.
   Ever since Kerkorian placed MGM-UA on the block in April 1988,
the sale has been an odyssey of failed financing, lawsuits and
juicy gossip.
   Kerkorian, who owns 80 percent of the company, has been courted
by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., Australia's Qintex Entertainment
Inc., PolyGram N.V., MCA Inc., Japan's C. Itoh and Co., Barris
Industries Inc., several unidentified foreign investors and the
Walt Disney Co.
   A March 1989 deal with Qintex appeared to be one of the most
likely to be completed. But the $1.5 billion transaction fell apart
when Qintex was unable to raise the money.
   If he is successful in selling the company, MGM-UA Chairman
Jeffrey Barbakow will receive a bonus of $21.4 million. He declined
to be interviewed Monday, but has said previously that he will
remain at the studio.

   A popular Republican launched a write-in
campaign for governor Monday, offering himself as an alternative to
the GOP candidate under fire over allegations he once asked
teen-age girls to go skinny dipping.
   The entry of State Auditor Arne Carlson as a write-in candidate
``kind of took the wind out'' of a move by some state lawmakers to
pressure Jon Grunseth to get out of the race, said Sanate minority
leader Duane Benson.
   His candidacy became controversial last week when two women
stepped forward to say that when they were teen-agers, Grunseth
tried to get them to swim nude with him in the pool at his home.
   At least nine Minnesota newspapers have run editorials calling
for Grunseth to step aside.
   The entry of the well known Carlson offers Republicans a choice,
some relieved party leaders noted.
   ``A lot of people are kind of comfortable with two (Republican)
people in it,'' said Benson said. ``But it would have really boiled
had Arne waited another day.''
   Prior to Carlson's announcement, State Rep. Elton Redalen warned
that Grunseth could drag down the rest of the Republican ticket
unless he quits.
   Redalen's call for Grunseth to step aside came three days after
an internal Republican poll indicated that five state Republicans
could defeat Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich in the Nov. 6 election,
but that Grunseth could not.
   Among the five was Carlson, who led Perpich by a 55-to-29
percent margin in the poll.
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he helped initiate the
survey, and has urged Grunseth to ``make a hard-minded, objective
decision about his own chances and the chances of all the other
candidates around him.''
   Carlson, who finished second to Grunseth in the Sept. 11
primary, announced his write-in candidacy at a news conference.
``We can win,'' he said.
   Carlson pledged a ``totally upbeat, positive campaign.
   ``This news conference is not to blame anyone but to allow all
Minnesotans to know full well that they are entitled to a campaign
that will dedicate itself to the high road,'' he said.
   A statewide bipartisan coalition of voters known as Minnesotans
for the WRITE Choice had rallied earlier in the day to encourage
Carlson to run.
   The nude-swimming allegations concern a 1981 Fourth of July
party at Grunseth's house. Two women who were 13 and 14 years old
at the time alleged in sworn statements that an apparently
intoxicated Grunseth encouraged them, his 13-year-old daughter,
Nina, and a 16-year-old girl to join him for a nude swim. One of
the women said Grunseth tried to pull down the strap of her swim
suit and to touch her breast.
   Grunseth has said that if any nude swimming occurred at the
party, it was after he went to bed. ``Have I ever been
skinny-dipping in my life?'' he said Sunday. ``Yeah. So what?''
   He also referred to a period in the late 1970s and early '80s as
his ``wild years,'' a remark that Redalen cited in calling for his
departure from the race.
   ``That's not acceptable to me or to my constituents down here,''
Redalen said. He added that he finds unacceptable a ``lifestyle of
fun and heavy drinking and womanizing ... even though it's in the
past.''
   Grunseth's continued presence in the race, Redalen said ``could
bring down the entire (Republican) statewide ticket, and we could
lose many of the seats we thought we could pick up in both the
House and Senate.''
   The Republican poll showed Grunseth trailing Perpich, 41 percent
to 24 percent. But Grunseth campaign chairman Leon Oistad said
another GOP poll, taken Friday night and Saturday morning, showed
that margin narrowing to a 37-to-27 percent Perpich lead.

<TEXT>
   Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald was
sentenced Monday to nearly six years in a tribal jail and fined
$11,000 for bribery, ethics violations and conspiracy.
   His son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., was given a 1{-year
sentence and fined $2,500.
   MacDonald, 61, who was suspended as tribal chairman last year,
was convicted in tribal court Wednesday of 41 counts of bribery,
conspiracy and ethics violations for taking cash, loans, plane
rides and use of an car from businessmen trying to curry favor with
him.
   His 36-year-old son was convicted of 23 counts of bribery, theft
by extortion, ethics violations and conspiracy.
   Judge Robert Yazzie sentenced MacDonald to 5 years and 335 days
in a tribal jail in Window Rock, the Navajo reservation's capital.
MacDonald also must do four years and 340 days of labor, similar to
community service, after his jail term, and his son must serve one
year of labor, Yazzie said.
   MacDonald is seeking the new office of president of the nation's
biggest Indian tribe. The tribal council on Friday voted to
authorize the election board to postpone the election, originally
scheduled for Nov. 6, for 60 days.
   He will remain in jail for at least a week until Yazzie rules if
he can be released on bail or his own recognizance pending an
appeal, said defense attorney Val Jolley.
   ``You have not admitted to any wrongding and shown no remorse,''
Yazzie said. ``I truly say you were a great leader and made
valuable contributions to the Navajo people.''
   MacDonald, a former aerospace engineer, showed no emotion as he
stood before the court.
   MacDonald's opponent in the election is former tribal chairman
Peterson Zah. Whether the conviction will remove him from the
ballot, as tribal law apparently requires, won't be known until
Tuesday at the earliest, when the tribal election board meets.
   The board is reviewing a proposed amendment to its code to allow
interim tribal leader Leonard Haskie, who finished third to
MacDonald and Zah in a non-partisan primary election, to run in
MacDonald's place.
   MacDonald's second trial was scheduled to begin Tuesday, but a
judge on Monday postponed it until Nov. 27.
   That case involves conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's
purchase of a ranch for $33.4 million from a company which paid
$26.2 million for the property only five minutes earlier. His son,
an unemployed lawyer, is a co-defendant.
   Last week, Byron ``Bud'' Brown, a Scottsdale real-estate agent
who allegedly was the middleman in the ranch sale, and his brother
were indicted on federal money-laundering and fraud charges in the
case.
   In another case, MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts stemming from
the tribe's 1986 primary and general elections. Suspended Vice
Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is a co-defendant.
   About 180,000 Navajos live on the 21,100-square-mile
reservation, the nation's largest. It covers a large portion of
northeastern Arizona and extends into southeastern Utah and
northwestern New Mexico.

   McGraw-Hill Inc. said its third-quarter profit edged up 5.1
percent from a year ago, as strong operating performances from its
financial services and book publishing businesses more than offset
lower results from broadcasting and information services.
   Media General Inc., meanwhile, reported its profit climbed 87
percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 compared with a year
earlier.

   The diversified New York-based media company said it earned
$67.4 million, or $1.38 a share, in the third quarter compared with
$64.1 million, or $1.31 a share, in 1989.
   Revenue rose 11.2 percent to $502.8 million from $452.2 million
a year earlier.
   Overall operating profit was up 20.4 percent to $98.3 million,
including $10 million in pretax savings from the 1989 corporate
realignment.
   Operating earnings rose 40 percent from financial services,
which include the Standard &amp; Poor's debt ratings service and MMS
International market research. Its educational and professional
publishing business posted a 36.5 percent rise in operating profit
for the quarter despite disappointing results in the college
segment.
   But operating profit slipped by less than 1 percent in
broadcasting because of the sale of syndicated programming in 1989.
   Operating profits from information and publications services
were down 7.1 percent due to the adverse impact of economic
uncertainty on advertising in Business Week magazine and the costs
of automation at the F.W. Dodge segment.

   Revenue rose 6.9 percent to $152.1 million from $142.3 million
in 1989, including gains in all three business divisions -
broadcast, newspapers and newsprint.
   Advertising in the company's newspapers remained generally

   Media General also owns the Richmond (Va.) Times-Dispatch, The

   Revenues rose 5.7 percent to $321.7 million from $304.3 million
last year.
   Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive, said operating
income rose for the quarter despite a very difficult advertising
revenue environment at the company's 19 daily newspapers.
   He cited a strong increase in cable television income, and said
the broadcast group performed well.
   Scripps owns nine television stations, five radio stations and
cable systems with 595,500 basic subscribers. The company also
syndicates and licenses news features and comics, such as
``Peanuts'' and ``Garfield.''
   For the first nine months, Scripps earned $27 million, or 35
cents a share, down 53.7 percent from $58.3 million, or 74 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 3.4 percent to $951.1 million
from $920.1 million.

   Pulitzer, based in St. Louis, had net earnings of $1.4 million,
or 13 cents a share, down from $3.2 million, or 31 cents a share,
for the same period last year. Revenues of $98 million were up 3.5
percent from $94.6 million.
   The cmpany, which reported a 33 percent decrease in profits
last quarter and a 70 percent decrease in the first quarter,
continued to blame soft newspaper advertising conditions.
   In addition, third-quarter profits were affected by costs
related to the purchase of WDSU-TV in New Orleans in December.
   ``While our third-quarter results are disappointing, we are
optimistic over the long term as we continue to emphasize market
share and cost control,'' said Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of the
board.
   For the first three quarters, net income was $6.9 million or 66
cents a share, down from $13.2 million, or $1.26 a share, last
year. Revenue increased to $297 million from $256 million.
   Pulitzer's newspaper operations include the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch and The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, and newspapers
and shoppers in the Chicago area.
   Pulitzer's broadcasting operations consist of
network-affilitated TV stations in Greenville, S.C.; Lancaster,
Pa., Winston-Salem, N.C.; Albuquerque, N.M.; Omaha, Neb.;
Louisville, Ky.; and New Orleans. Pulitzer also owns two radio

   The New York Times Co. said its after-tax profit skidded 95.6
percent in the third quarter from results a year ago, which were
fattened by a large, one-time gain on the sale of its cable
television operations.
   Affiliated Publications, owner of The Boston Globe, reported its
net earnings dropped by more than 50 percent, add McClatchy

   The newspaper, magazine and broadcast company said it earned
$9.2 million, or 12 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept.
30, compared with $210.8 million, or $2.68 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue edged up 1.3 percent to $420.7 million from $415.3
million.
   The 1989 results included $2.47 a share from the sale and
results of NYT Cable TV, which was sold in August 1989.
   Even without counting the cable sale gain, Times said its income
from continuing operations was down 43.9 percent from a year ago
because of a decline in advertising linage at its flagship
newspaper and costs related to two new plants.
   Income from continuing operations amounted to $9.2 million, down
from $16.4 million a year earlier.
   Operating profit in the newspaper group dropped 43.8 percent to
$19.6 million in the quarter from $34.9 million a year earlier. Ad
linage was down 10.7 percent at The New York Times, but up 4
percent at the company's 35 regional newspapers.
   Depreciation and interest expenses on a new production center in
Edison, N.J., and a new facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News
reduced earnings by 9 cents a share in the quarter.
   For the first nine months, the company earned $52.6 million, or
69 cents a share, down 81.6 percent from $285.6 million, or $3.63 a
share, from a year ago. The 1989 results included $2.52 a share

   Sacramento, Calif.-based McClatchy earned $7.5 million, or 26

31 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 12.8 percent to $107.0 million from $94.9 million.
   The company said the profit decline stemmed from the costs of
buying six newspapers in South Carolina in January and losses on
its investment in a new newsprint mill. It said profit would have
risen slightly otherwise.
   For the first nine months, McClatchy earned $17.7 million, or 62

<HEAD>Phillips Plans To Retire as Dow Jones Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warren H. Phillips, chairman and chief executive
of Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., plans to step down next year.
   Phillips said Oct. 17 that he would relinquish his chief
executive duties Jan. 1 and retire as chairman July 1.
   Phillips, 64, has been chief executive of the media and
financial information company since 1975 and chairman since 1978.
He will be 65 by the time he retires as chairman.
   Peter R. Kann, the company's president and chief operating
officer, is to succeed Phillips as chief executive. Kann also is
publisher of The Wall Street Journal.
   Spokesman Roger May said Phillips' decision to leave was based
on the customary retirement age of 65 and was unconnected with
recent financial troubles at the company, which reported a sharp
drop in third-quarter earnings.
   Dow Jones has no mandatory retirement age except for its
directors, who must step down at 70, May said.
   The timing of Phillips' announcement came as a surprise to some
Dow Jones employees. It followed the bad earnings report and the
disclosure of a severe cost-cutting plan.
   But May said the company's outside directors knew of Phillips'
plans for more than a year.
   Phillips will remain on the company's board of directors. No
date was set for election of a new chairman.

   United Press International and Reuters settled
their court dispute over photo services, agreeing Reuters will
continue to supply UPI with foreign news photos but will cover the
United States for itself.
   A 1984 agreement called for UPI to supply Reuters with
photographs from the United States and for Reuters to provide UPI
with pictures from other countries. The agreement was to run for 10
years beginning in 1985.
   Reuters later sued to void the picture exchange, and UPI filed a
counterclaim saying Reuters had negotiated in bad faith.
   No compensation or monetary damages will be paid by either
organization under the settlement, the news organizations said Oct.
19. The announcement said UPI will have the option of ending the
exchange agreement by giving Reuters 30 days' notice.
   Otherwise, Reuters will supply UPI with foreign news photos
without charge until September 1992. After that, UPI will have the
option of subscribing to the Reuter service.
   Reuters will cover the United States with its own resources and
will not use UPI pictures, the announcement said. It said UPI will

<HEAD>Suit Against Tribune Newspapers in Arizona Dropped</HEAD>

   A former Arizona State University football coach
agreed Oct. 19 to drop a $2 million libel suit against Tribune
Newspapers, which publishes in Mesa, Tempe and Chandler.
   An agreement to drop the suit by former strength coach Ronald
Jones was signed by attorneys for Jones and the newspaper company
and sent to Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Frederick Martone.
   The September 1989 suit concerned comments attributed to Jones
in a story published in the newspapers a year earlier about steroid
use by the Sun Devil football team in 1985 and 1986.
   Jones was quoted as saying steroid use on the team increased
after head coach John Cooper took over in 1985. Jones, now a coach
with the Philadelphia Eagles, later denied making the statements to
reporter Mike Tulumello. The reporter said he tape-recorded the
interview.
   The agreement to drop the suit stipulated that Jones was indeed
the source of the statements and that he suffered no damages from
the article.
   ``The suit was baseless, should never have been filed, and
certainly should never have remained active this long,'' a

   A former independent distributor of The
Oregonian has been sentenced to 21 years in prison for plotting to
kill two executives of the Portland, Ore., newspaper. Neither of
the men was hurt.
   Marvin M. Clapp, 47, of Vancouver, was sentenced Oct. 19 for
soliciting to commit murder and arson.
   He was convicted in June of hiring Billy Ray Robinson of
Vancouver to kill circulation director Patrick L. Marlton and
Robert J. Gillard, home-delivery zone manager.
   Gunshots were fired at the men's homes in August 1989. Marlton's
home was firebombed Jan. 8, causing about $30,000 damage.
   Robinson, who testified against Clapp, was sentenced to five
years' probation on a first-degree arson charge.
   Prosecutors said Clapp wanted revenge because his distribution
contract was not renewed in 1982 when The Oregonian began using its
own distribution agents. Clapp had blamed Marlton and Gillard
specifically for the loss of his dealership, for which he had paid
about $38,000.
   Clapp had sued The Oregonian twice earlier, charging breach of
contract and slander. He lost both lawsuits.

   Associated Press sports writer Ronald Blum was
arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest Oct.
17 while covering the World Series.
   Richard L. Creighton Jr., Blum's attorney, filed written pleas
of innocent the next day with Hamilton County Municipal Judge
Joseph Luebbers. The court scheduled a Nov. 9 trial before
Municipal Judge Albert Mestemaker.
   Blum was arrested in a dispute with police at Riverfront Stadium
immediately after the Cincinnati Reds' 5-4 victory over the Oakland
Athletics. He was released on his own recognizance.
   Police said Blum, who is based in New York, became disorderly
and used profanity when a stadium security woman attempted to keep
him from getting onto a crowded elevator with other reporters
returning to the press box from post-game interviews.
   Blum, who has been with the AP since February 1986, denied being
abusive, disorderly or resisting arrest.
   ``I was just trying to do my job. I told them I had to write a
story and went on the elevator,'' Blum said. ``When the elevator
got upstairs and I tried to get off, they pulled me back and told
me I was under arrest.''
   ``He was on deadline and was trying to get back up here with
some quotes,'' said Terry Taylor, the AP's deputy sports editor who
directed the news cooperative's coverage of the game.
   A spokesman for Major League Baseball declined comment on the
incident.

   The drug cartels have made the news
business deadly for journalists in Colombia, the editor in chief of
the newspaper El Tiempo said.
   Enrique Santos Castillo said his nephew, Francisco Santos
Calderon, had planned to attend the Oct. 16 meeting of the Inter
American Press Association with him in Kansas City, but had been
kidnapped and is said to be a captive of the Medellin drug cartel.
   ``We walk around with armed guards. We have armored cars. We
have soldiers in our homes. It's an incredible situation,'' Santos
Castillo said.
   At latest count, the cartels hold seven Colombian journalists
captive as a means of intimidation.
   ``All the newspapers of Colombia have assumed a very courageous
posture against the drug mafia,'' he said.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, owner and editor of the Bogota daily El
Espectador, has seen his brother murdered and his paper bombed on
orders of the drug cartels.
   El Espectador may compete for readers with El Tiempo, but the
two are united in their stand against the grip cocaine cartels have
on Colombia.
   ``I am convinced that the free press will come through, as it
has always come through,'' Cano said.
   Edward Seaton, president of IAPA, which monitors press freedoms
in the Americas, said drug violence had killed 19 Colombian news
media employees in 1989 and seven so far this year.
   Also attending the special conference on Colombia were Jorge
Hernandez, general editor of El Colombiano, a daily in the cocaine
capital of Medellin, and Luis Fernando Santos, general manager of
El Tiempo and the son of Santos Castillo.

   It called on the government to reverse an Oct. 10 decision
making the newspaper and some 30 other publications part of the

   Tineretul Liber's editorial board maintains the staff should be

He accused the journalists of trying to steal state property.

   The Federal Trade Commission on Oct. 15
challenged R.R. Donnelley &amp; Son Co.'s acquisition of a smaller
publishing-printing partnership, saying it could substantially
lessen competition in the high-volume publication field.
   Donnelley, which has its headquarters in Chicago, bought the
Meredith-Burda companies for $570 million in a deal completed Sept.
4. The previous week, a U.S. District Court judge denied the FTC's
request for a preliminary injunction blocking the sale.
   ``We were convinced at the very beginning, when this sale was
agreed upon in December 1989, that it did not present legal
obstacles,'' said James Ratcliff, Donnelley's vice president for
corporate affairs. ``We think we were right on the facts of the
law, and that we have a good case, and we will press on.''
   The FTC issued an administrative complaint that the acquisition
``created a firm whose share of the market is so high that it has
become a dominant firm.'' It said the deal will eliminate
competition among other firms in the market.
   Donnelly is a printing firm specializing in high-volume
publication gravure printing of the type used for long runs of
magazines, newspaper inserts and catalogues. Meredith Corp., based
in Des Moines, Iowa, is a magazine publisher that also owns seven
television stations. It is a partner in printing operations with

<HEAD>ABC Closing Bureaus in Three Cities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it's still earning money, ABC News will
close its bureaus in Chicago, Boston and Dallas because of lean
times, but will maintain reporters in all three cities, an ABC
spokesman said Oct. 18.
   The spokesman, Scott Richardson, said no further cuts were
expected. The bureaus will be closed by Dec. 31.
   The move, which leaves ABC with nine U.S. bureaus, comes as ABC
News is undergoing belt-tightening as a result of Persian Gulf
coverage costs and lower-than-expected advertising revenues that
affect all three networks.
   In Dallas, correspondent Charles Murphy will work from his home.
In Boston, a two-person staff will be kept to work with ABC's
medical correspondent, Dr. Tim Johnson, who reports for several ABC
shows.
   In Chicago, correspondent Chris Bury will work out of ABC-owned
WLS-TV.
   Twelve off-camera staff members are affected by the closings.
Some will be reassigned or offered other jobs and others will be
let go, Richardson said. He said it was not yet known how many
would be laid off.
   CBS, which has seven domestic bureaus, and NBC, which has nine,
have no plans to close any offices, spokeswomen for those networks
said.
   ABC's action was expected. The network earlier put on hold a
planned 1 a.m.-6 a.m. news feed to its affiliates that would have
begun in January. That operation would have employed 40 people.
   ABC News officials have said the division will show a profit
this year despite the lean times, although it probably will earn
about $25 million less than the $75 million that had been
anticipated.
   NBC News recently said it would let go 25 staff members, but it
isn't a cutback, said NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble. Their skills
were just not needed for various projects being planned. Ms. Hubble
said NBC is hiring an additional 100 staff members, the majority
for the 24-hour NBC News Channel for affiliates it is starting next
year.
   The remainder would work for the new ``Real Life With Jane
Pauley'' series that NBC says it will add to its schedule as a
midseason replacement.

<HEAD>Gynecologist Refiles Suit Against CBS</HEAD>

   Former gynecologist James Burt has refiled
his $250 million defamation suit against CBS Inc.
   Last month, U.S. District Judge Walter Rice dismissed a portion
of Burt's suit, saying Burt has no private right of action under
the FCC's personal-attack rule. However, Rice said he would
consider further arguments on the question of whether the statute
of limitations had run out on the CBS broadcast in question.
   Attorney Earl Moore said the suit was refiled Oct. 12 in U.S.
District Court without the arguments on the FCC issue.
   Burt filed the original suit in March, alleging he was defamed
by a CBS television program on his sex-related surgery.
   The October 1988 episode of ``West 57th Street'' featured
interviews with Burt and several of his patients.
   Burt is facing scores of medical malpractice suits for his
self-described ``love surgery,'' in which he physically altered the
genitals of his female patients to allegedly enhance sexual
responsiveness. The suits allege Burt performed the surgery either
without patient consent or by fraudulently obtaining consent.
   In January 1989, Burt surrendered his medical license to the
State Medical Board after being charged with gross immorality and
other violatons.

<HEAD>Newswoman Files Sexual Discrimination Suit Against Dees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newswoman filed a sex discrimination
lawsuit against ``Into the Night'' TV host Rick Dees, claiming she
was publicly humiliated by risque jokes during his appearance on a
TV show.
   Liz Fulton said in her Superior Court suit filed Oct. 16 that
Dees humiliated her by appearing on ``The Wally George Show'' in
1988 with a scantily clad, buxom woman he identified as Miss
Fulton.
   ``This is only the tip of the iceberg on how women are forced to
endure sexual stereotypes in broadcasting. But many don't file
lawsuits because they fear they will be blackballed by the
industry,'' said attorney Gloria Allred.
   Dees, a KIIS-FM radio personality who worked with Miss Fulton
until she was fired in April, recently began as host of the
late-night variety show ``Into the Night Starring Rick Dees.''
   Jack Silver, a spokesman for KIIS-FM, referred all calls to
Gannett Radio, which owns the station.
   ``We have received the documents from Liz Fulton's attorney and
we are now reviewing them,'' said Jay Cook, Gannett Radio
president. ``We will respond when appropriate.''
   While acting as his radio show sidekick, Ms. Fulton said Dees
frequently referred to her as ``Liz Rugburn Fulton.''
   ``In addition,'' the suit said, ``Dees humiliated and damaged
her when he appeared on `The Wally George Show' . . . accompanied
by a woman purporting to be Ms. Fulton who was dressed in a scant
bikini.
   ``The impostor behaved in an inappropriate and embarrassing
manner and was eventually led off the set in handcuffs.''
   Ms. Allred said her client, now a newswoman at KFI radio, never
consented to the impersonation.
   Additionally, the suit states Ms. Fulton, 37, believes she was
fired because ``she was perceived as too old and family oriented
and not sufficiently sexy enough to satisfy Mr. Dees.''
   Dees was accused of employment discrimination on the basis of
sex and age and unauthorized commercial use of Miss Fulton's name,
invasion of privacy, intentional misrepresentation and defamation.
   Ms. Fulton asked for general, compensatory and punitive damages
for humiliation, mental anguish, anger and emotional distress. The
dollar amount would be determined at trial.

   Random House says a new book by Rupert Murdoch will cover
everything from his global media invasion to a recipe for jet lag.
Murdoch will disclose his theories of success, his view of women in
business and his philosophy of hiring and firing. The book is to be
published next year . . . The National Enquirer has been tattling
about celebrities for decades. Now the tables are turned somewhat,
in the form of stories by ``60 Minutes'' and Los Angeles magazine,
and lawsuits filed by Elizabeth Taylor and Roseanne Barr. But
Enquirer Editor Iain Calder said readers won't see any difference
in the way the newspaper covers stories. ``It sort of goes with the
territory. Every few years you suddenly get attacked. After all
these stories are run, within a few days, the dust will settle.''

   Budget negotiators are ready to boost gasoline
taxes by at least a nickel a gallon and are narrowing differences
over new taxes for the rich and cuts in Medicare benefits.
   But after a weekend of dickering that featured a well-timed
walkout by an unusually talkative White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu, a final agreement on a $250-billion assortment of tax hikes
and spending cuts reained elusive.
   ``It's a very difficult negotiation,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
said as talks among congressional leaders ended late Sunday. ``Our
problem is trying to put something together that passes both
houses.''
   Lawmakers planned to resume their search today for a compromise
package that would also satisfy President Bush and allow Congress
to go home for the year by week's end.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush's rebuke of new civil rights
legislation is a ``race-conscious'' political ploy reminiscent of
the 1988 Willie Horton campaign ad, civil rights advocates are
charging.
   ``It is a clear attempt to incite fear in white workers, to
incite fear in white businesses,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said
Sunday.
   Bush said Saturday he would veto the bill today, declaring it
would force businesses to adopt hiring and promotion quotas to ward
off lawsuits. He sent Congress an alternate plan, but it was
quickly condemned by civil rights activists.
   Congressional leaders said they would wage an override battle
over the vetoed bill, which they said is necessary to combat job
discrimination.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Democrats are likely to bolster their majority
of governorships this year but face tough Republican resistance in
three Sunbelt states crucial to congressional redistricting.
   A state-by-state Associated Press survey showed Democrats with
credible challenges to six GOP governors and running strong races
in four other states where Republican governors are retiring.
   By contrast, no incumbent Democratic governor appears seriously
threatened. Republicans have high hopes in six states where
Democratic governors are not seeking re-election.
   All told, the AP survey found 14 races for governor and seven
Senate contests too close to call.

   ATLANTA (AP) - Tuberculosis, dreaded by earlier generations as
much as AIDS is feared now, is headed for its biggest increase on
record in the United States. And the comeback is blamed in part on
AIDS.
   Reported cases of TB in 1990 are up 9 percent compared to a year
ago, when the disease reversed a decade of decline, the Centers for
Disease Control reported.
   Tuberculosis, an often lethal disease, affected millions before
drugs to combat it were developed about three decades ago.
   ``It was forgotten, but not gone,'' Donald Kopanoff, associate
director of the CDC's Division of Tuberculosis, said last week.
``It ought not to be turning around and going up. That is a
terrible shame.''
   ---&equals;
   JERUSALEM (AP) - Thousands of police patrolled Jersusalem today
after a Palestinian went on a rampage and stabbed to death three
Israelis, and police planned to close the city to Arabs to prevent
further violence.
   The slayings Sunday morning in a quiet neighborhood raised
tensions in a city already stretched to the limit by the Temple
Mount killings, in which police opened fire on stone-throwing
Palestinians and killed 19.
   Police said the 19-year-old Arab laborer accused in Sunday's
stabbing deaths was seeking revenge for the Oct. 8 killings on the
Temple Mount, which is sacred to both Moslems and Jews.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's senior adviser, Avi Pazner,
sought to lay some blame for Sunday's rampage with the U.N.
Security Council, which condemned Israel for the Temple Mount
killings.

<TEXT>
   Americans holed up in the U.S. Embassy
fight boredom by watching old war movies on video, playing chess
and pumping iron. Mostly, they try to keep their spirits up.
   They are among more than 1,000 Americans prevented from leaving
Iraq and Kuwait because Saddam Hussein's government wants human
shields against attacks by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the
Persian Gulf.
   About 600 foreigners, including 104 Americans, have been taken
to strategic locations in Iraq that would be most vulnerable to air
attacks, according to diplomatic sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Americans are among several thousand foreigners stranded or
held in Iraq since Saddam's forces seized Kuwait on Aug. 2. Saddam
calls them ``guests'' who will remain in Iraq ``until the clouds
roll by and the sky once again becomes clear.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Resolution Trust Corp., faced with a
limited pool of outside talent to help clean up the savings and
loan mess, has bent its ethics rules to do business with some
companies.
   The RTC, the federal agency responsible for disposing of
hundreds of collapsed S&amp;Ls, is signing on about 1,000 new
contractors a week and could soon rival the Defense Department as a
lucrative source of government contracts.
   At the same time, there is a limited number of outside
companies, such as accounting firms, with the expertise the RTC
needs. Because the $500 billion savings and loan scandal is so
far-reaching, many of the companies with the know-how needed to
resolve it have been touched by it in some way.
   ``All of a sudden you find yourself with very few horses in the
corral that aren't lame in some way,'' said Caryl Austrian, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The RTC has bent its rules by granting conflict-of-interest
waivers to 11 companies, from big accounting firms to mortgage
companies and real estate brokerages, documents examined by The
Associated Press show. Many of the companies are the objects of
lawsuits that the RTC and the FDIC inherited from seized banks and
S&amp;Ls.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli forces blocked Palestinians from
entering Jerusalem on Monday to prevent clashes following the
murders of three Jews by a knife-wielding Arab.
   A Palestinian teen-ager was killed and 19 others were
hospitalized with wounds suffered in clashes with Israeli troops
Monday throughout the occupied West Bank, Arab reports said.
   Despite the heightened security in Jerusalem, a Palestinian
stabbed a Jew, slightly injuring him. Police searched a nearby
village for the assailant.
   Also Monday, an 18-year-old Palestinian died of wounds suffered
in an August 1988 clash. Mohammed Naim Abu Akar was known among
Palestinians as ``the living martyr'' for surviving on intravenous
feedings after Israeli bullets destroyed his intestines.
   ---&equals;
   ATLANTA (AP) - Cocaine speeded the growth of the AIDS virus in
laboratory tests, prompting concern that it could increase infected
people's chances of developing the deadly disease, researchers
reported Monday.
   Microbiologists at the University of Minnesota Medical School
exposed cells that are the primary target for the AIDS virus to
doses of cocaine. The virus, HIV, was found to grow as much as
three times faster in the cocaine-laced tests than in control
studies.
   If what happened in the test tube happens in HIV-infected
cocaine users, it could increase their risk of developing AIDS,
said Dr. Ronald Schut, the lead researcher.
   ``In persons who are infected, if they continue to abuse this
drug it may have a significant impact on the development of
clinical AIDS,'' Schut said.

activity will have neither good plumbing nor good philosophy.
Neither its pipes nor its theories will hold water.'' - John W.
Gardner, former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (1912-

Charlotte Saunders Cushman, American actress (1816-1876).

<HEAD>TV's Most Boring Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   How boring is television?
   Television is so boring, according to Alan Caruba, that it rots
your brain, leads to drug and alcohol addiction, encourages divorce
and speeds society's demise.
   Which leaves ``waxy yellow buildup'' and ``ring around the
collar'' as seemingly the only travesties in life not caused by an
idle brain.
   Boredom is Caruba's speciality.
   Well, boredom and public relations.
   From his home in Maplewood, N.J., the 53-year-old Caruba founded
The Boring Institute in 1984. Intended as a spoof of the much-hyped
entertainment world, the institute publishes yearly lists of the
most boring celebrities, the most boring films and ``Fearless
Forecasts of TV's Fall Flops.''
   Caruba knows a lot about hype. For 20-plus years he has been in
the public relations business (his real job) and before that he was
a journalist.
   ``I certainly have a very fine sense of hype,'' Caruba says in a
phone interview from his home, which he has shared with his parents
for most of his bachelor life. ``It's almost as if I'm the doctor
of hype.''
   When it comes to television predictions, the doctor is in. Most
of the time, anyway.
   This fall's picks as the best of the worst:
   ``E.A.R.T.H. Force,'' ``Family Man,'' ``Sons and Daughters'' and
``Uncle Buck'' on CBS; ``Lifestories,'' ``Ferris Bueller,''
``Parenthood,'' ``The Fanelli Boys,'' and ``Hull High,'' on NBC;
``Cop Rock'' and ``Going Places'' on ABC and ``D.E.A.,'' ``Parker
Lewis Can't Lose,'' and ``Beverly Hills, 90210,'' on Fox
Broadcasting Co.
   ``E.A.R.T.H. Force'' has been canceled after three episodes.
``Sons and Daughters'' probably won't make it onto the small screen
until next year. The rest of Caruba's cancellation predictions have
yet to materialize, but the shows' ratings are lackluster.
   Caruba's forecast is ``very successful,'' he says, ``mostly
because it's incredibly accurate, if I may be so vain.''
   Caruba may be vain, but he also is good at getting the media to
pay attention to him. His lists have generated hundreds of radio
interview requests, several talk-show appearances and stories in
The Boston Globe, The New York Times and Newsday.
   Like Mr. Blackwell's annual ``Worst Dressed'' list, Caruba's
catalog punctures some of the biggest egos in Hollywood. Among last
year's most boring celebs: Cher, Zsa Zsa Gabor and Roseanne Barr.
   Among last year's TV cancellation predictions: ``Peaceable
Kingdom'' (axed), ``Baywatch'' (gone) and ``Sister Kate'' (outta
here).
   Caruba says he has never heard a word from anyone at any of the
networks about his yearly forecast. ``I am widely and universally
ignored by the networks in terms of their programmers.''
   Not one would comment on Caruba's list for this column.
   ``It doesn't take a genius to predict failure in television,''
said Brad Turell, Fox's senior vice president of publicity.
   But Caruba has more in mind than just poking fun at television
and celebrities. He believes that boredom causes most of society's
ills.
   ``I take what I do very seriously,'' says Caruba, whose efforts
as the one-man Boring Institute include designating each July as
``Anti-Boredom Month.''
   He also publishes a pamphlet titled ``Ten Secrets to Avoid
Boredom.'' Among its recommendations: Read more, develop hobbies
and be nice to yourself.
   ``Boredom in people's lives causes depression and drug and
alcohol abuse,'' Caruba says. ``A lot of the major social issues
start with something as common as boredom.''
   When it comes to television, Caruba says, the boob tube is not
only boring in its mediocrity, it is a drug.
   ``Television is addicting,'' he says. ``It encourages people to
abandon their lives and live vicariously through this emptiness on
TV.''
   And though the mind seemingly zones out while watching the small
screen, in reality heavy TV viewing ``creates a constant state of
tension,'' Caruba says. ``Television's real secret message is that
the viewer is somehow inadequate. There's something wrong with the
viewer's life because they're not a superstar, they're not rich and
famous.''
   Does Caruba like anything on television?
   Well, yes. He likes ``Murphy Brown'' and ``Major Dad'' on CBS.
   Television is not all bad, he emphasizes. When watched
selectively it is just fine. When viewed constantly, it is a real
bore.
   And we all know now what that means.
   ---
   Elsewhere in Television...
   REASON 439 TO CONTINUE LIVING: ``Leafy Green Dreams,'' the same
copany that made the ``I Killed Laura Palmer'' T-shirts, has a new
one available. It says ``Nuke The Simpsons.''

<HEAD>A Congress of Special Interest Spenders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Households know that when expenses exceed income
they must: (a) cut expenses, (b) raise income or (c) simultaneously
cut expenses and raise income.
   Judging from its record, Congress either does not know these
choices or chooses to ignore them.
   Since 1976 federal spending under the budget control act has
grown by more than $500 billion, compared with half that in the 15
preceding years. Those are comparable dollars, adjusted for
inflation.
   For 13 of the 16 years under the act, Congress failed to pass
its first budget resolution on time. For seven of the past eight
years, it has failed to complete its budget before start of the new
fiscal year.
   As a consequence, Congress since 1975 has been forced to pass 46
emergency stop-gap spending bills, and in six of the past 10 years
the federal government has run out of funds.
   Households couldn't get away with it. Neither could businesses,
churches, univerities, or philanthropic organizations. But what's
impossible for all other institutions is marvelously easy for
Congress.
   Unless the law is changed, the situation won't be any better in
the future, says the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think
tank. It claims the law is flawed, encouraging special interest
spending and discouraging saving.
   ``The tragedy of the system is that because everyone is to
blame, no one is to blame,'' says Mark B, Liedl, director of the
foundation's congressional assessment project.
   Prior to 1974, presidents had the authority to refuse
appropriations made by Congress, and they did so. But in that year,
the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act was passed. It
expanded congressional control over the budget process while
reducing the president's powers to limit spending.
   That situation exists today. Says Liedl, ``While 535 politicians
in Washington are empowered under the Budget Act to spend money, no
one is responsible for cutting spending.''
   Since then, Congress has had a very tough time meeting
requirements of the law it passed. ``It routinely ignores its
promises to cut spending,'' says Liedl.
   In fact, he says, Congress has reneged on each of five budget
summit agreements between 1982 and 1989, failing to lower spending
to agreed-upon levels, while including tax increases in four of the
agreements.
   Whatever agreement is made this year, he suggests, will be no
different. For promises of future unspecified and unlikely cuts to
be determined by its committees, Congress will immediately receive
higher revenues through taxes.
   Congress, itself, recognized the problem, passing in 1985 the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control
Act, which provides for automatic across the board cuts if Congress
fails to make its own.
   But Laidl says Congress simply ignores or modifies the law to
avoid the consequences. Since 1985 it has voted 16 times to waive
the law and, he says, increase spending freely.
   It leaves Congress with a pro-spending bias, he says, driven by
special-interst demands and an insatiable hunger for re-election,
a bias that compels members to rate local interests higher than the
national good.
   He contends that for common sense and financial logic the
president must be granted line-item veto authority, which was
eliminated in 1974. Even now, 43 of 50 governors have such powers.
   He suggests elimination also of so-called baselines, or
estimated levels of funds that must be budgeted if existing
services are to continue. These baselines are not horizontal; they
always rise, locking in higher spending.
   In your household budget, a cut would reduce expenditures below
an earlier month or year. In baseline budgeting, you would raise
the current-year spending over that of the previous year, and make
any ``cuts'' from the higher figure.
   Finally, he would encourage the injection of discipline into the
budget process by requiring Congress to pass a binding budget law
each year, rather than the current nonbinding budget resolution.

   You're standing in the river. The cool water
rushes through your legs and the round pebbles below massage your
feet. You reflect: The river water is always the same and always
different.
   Watching ``Art of Indonesia: Tales From the Shadow World,'' a
documentary that airs tonight on PBS, inspires Buddhist meditations
such as these, piquing one's thoughts to consider nature's more
metaphysical lessons.
   After all, the lotus blossom, like the self, has many layers.
   The documentary is more a montage of beguiling images than of
explanatory narration. There are lush shots of the verdant Bali and
Java countryside wrapped in gauzy mist; strange and unusual
Bronze-age icons of gods and goddesses; temples, sculptures and
Buddha statues with their mysterious Mona Lisa smiles.
   Spun between the evocative pictures are snippets of Indonesian
folklore. The village blacksmith was revered because he forged new
elements in the fire, which cleansed and purifed the metals while
creating something new.
   There are magic scrolls, singing healers, wise women and the
puppet master who tells tales of heroes and kings with his carved
stick figures who dance before a linen screen.
   Writer-director Andrea Simon took a film crew to numerous
locations in Indonesia's 13,000 island archipelago chain, such as
Borobudur, the largest Buddhist monument where serene Buddhas watch
out over Java's countryside.
   ``Turn from desire and leave behind the world of suffering,'' a
narrator intones.
   If there is a problem with ``Art of Indonesia'' it's that too
much is packed into its scant 30 minutes. The several vignettes
quickly hopscotch around, giving it a blustery feel - like an
autumn leaf tossed in the wind.
   Although it lacks a cohesive thread, the documentary does retain
the quality of the river water running through your feet - always
different, always the same, but refreshing nonetheless.
   The film coincides with an art exhibition, ``The Sculpture of
Indonesia,'' and an 18-month long Festival of Indonesia, which
began last month in Washington, D.C., and includes 250 events and
exhibitions in more than 50 cities, according to the filmmakers.
   ``The Sculpture of Indonesia'' opened at the National Gallery of
Art in Washington, D.C., and will travel to the Museum of Fine Arts
in Houston, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the
Asian Art Museum in San Francisco.
   ``Art of Indonesia'' was produced by the National Gallery of Art
and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and underwritten by Mobil
Corporation.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Medicine has been encroaching on death for years
now, pushing existing technology to the limit. But now, out of the
laboratory, comes a new approach using two new technologies that
can alter our own bodies and instruct them how to beat the bum raps
that nature deals out.

   Imagine killer cells, coded to make them
more potent, that go to the heart of cancers and make them bleed to
death, a kind of microscopic dum-dum bullet that saves lives.
   Also think about cells equipped with missing genes that are
injected into humans to thwart those deficits of nature that leave
numberless humans to suffer shortened lives.
   Then consider:
   -In September a child began to receive cells reaped from her own
body and genetically altered to cure a disease that would otherwise
have left her at the mercy of infections that would only deal
normal people a glancing blow.
   -So far 10 melanoma victims, each of whom had barely three
months to live, have been given altered cells that proved for the
first time that foreign genes could be introduced into humans
safely and could remain biologically active in the human body.
Coincidentally, three of the first five showed dramatic shrinking
of their tumors and one had complete remission.
   -And the same scientists who conducted these tests are ready to
introduce altered genes into humans to enhance the potency of
killer cells to tumors to help them fight a variety of cancers that
would otherwise overwhelm their immune systems.
   Two different therapies are coming together - immunotherapy,
helping the immune system to fight established cancers, and gene
transfer, in which a debilitated cell is corrected by inserting a
healthy gene for a defective one.
   It's as if a door is opening and a small shaft of light is
reaching into the very processes that control our lives.
   There is evidence right here and now that mankind can instruct
its own genes, tell them what to do.
   How many thousands of currently doomed human beings will be
saved is not yet ours to know. But it is hard to hold back the
breathtaking possibilities.
   ``You have to remember that last year in the United States
cancer killed 495,000 people,'' says Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the
National Institutes of Health. ``That means that one of six
Americans now alive is going to die of cancer. That's in spite of
our best available treatments, and we have good treatments. We can
cure half of everybody who develops the disease using surgery and
radiation and chemotherapy. But the half that can't be cured is
more Americans every year than died in World War II and Vietnam
combined.
   ``So we are in desperate need of new cancer treatments and these
biological approaches I'm hoping will become a fourth way to treat
cancer. They can join surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
   ``They are intrinsically different. Biological therapies don't
directly attack the cancer. Rather they try to alter the host so
that the host's own natural defenses will lead to the rejection of
the cancer. That's the avenue we are pursuing.''
   And there is a sense of urgency.
   Dr. W. French Anderson, a gene therapy researcher at NIH and
editor of the new journal of Human Gene Therapy, wrote recently
that he remembered ``the anguished words'' at a public forum of one
Ola Huntley, three of whose children have the inherited disease
called sickle cell anemia.
   She said, ``I resent the fact that a few well-meaning
individuals have presented arguments strong enough to curtail the
scientific technology which promises to give hope to those
suffering from a genetic disease.''
   That was in 1983.
   In an editorial this summer, Dr. Anderson asked rhetorically,
``What's The Rush?''
   ``The rush is the daily necessity to help sick people. Their
(our) illnesses will not wait for a more convenient time. We need
help when we are sick...So...ask the cancer patient who has only a
few months to live, ask the AIDS patient whose body is shriveling,
ask Ola Huntley. The `rush' arises from our human compassion for
our fellow man who needs help now. It will take many years of
clinical studies before gene therapy can be a widely used treatment
procedure. The sooner we begin, the sooner patients will be
helped.''
   It has begun. And in coming years it could explode.
   There are plans for clinical trials at research institutions all
across the country. Dr. Malcolm Brenner at St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., is designing a clinical trial
to fight juvenile leukemia and certain solid tumors. Dr. Ken
Cornetta at the University of Wisconsin is doing the same for adult
leukemia and some solid tumors.
   Dr. Mike Lotze at the University of Pittsburgh is planning a
clinical trial similar to the ones being done at NIH, using tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) to goad the immune system into
throwing off cancers. There are half a dozen other experiments
planned.
   ``All of us have cancers in us all of the time,'' Dr. Anderson
explains. ``We have about 50 trillion cells in our body and
occasionally something is going to go wrong. But our immune systems
recognize that and keep it down. Only when a group of cells is
dividing out of control and overwhelm the immune defenses do you
get a cancer. What Steve Rosenberg's approach has been for 15 years
is to help the immune system fight back.''
   In the first wave of experiments in immunotherapy against
cancer, the TILs have been the weapon of choice. The scientists
readily admit they were lucky with the first five patients. While
the experiment was designed basically to demonstrate the safety of
inserting foreign genes into human cells, the byproduct was lives
saved.
   Pieces of tumors were excised from the five and minced and grown
outside the body with interleukin-2, a substance that encourages
lymphocyte growth in the body.

   The active cells mass-produced, doubling and redoubling in days.
The idiosyncrasy of these cells is that they home in on tumors from
which they were derived. The cells were then reinjected into the
patients.
   Three of the five patients showed anti-tumor effects. One
patient, a 27-year-old mother, had over 30 melanoma tumors in her
lung, skin and mouth, a particularly virulent cancer untreatable in
advanced stages. They have all disappeared and she is back at work.
   A second patient's tumor was completely arrested, stopped in its
tracks. She is back at work teaching aerobic dancing. A third
patient had 95 percent to 98 percent reduction in his tumors, but
it failed to hold for 30 days. He was re-treated and this time the
tumor was arrested. But after a year he slipped back again and died
last Sept. 14.
   That same day the NIH team used a different technique on a
4-year-old girl who was suffering from a rare disease, severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID), which leaves its victim
defenseless against infection and cancers.
   These children, who used to be called ``bubble babies'' after
the extreme isolation required to protect them from disease, can be
maintained by giving them a missing enzyme called adenosine
deaminase. And in fact being on that therapy is a requirement for
the current gene transfer therapy. There are fewer than 20 SCID
patients in the world.
   The 4-year-old's blood was taken and the T-lymphocytes were
given a gene for the missing enzyme. They were grown in profusion
outside the body and then a billion of them were infused into the
child.
   The treatment will continue, but it may be months before
appreciable results can be seen. One reason is caution. Some people
are still worried about tinkering with human genes and perhaps
creating Frankenstein diseases that could run rampant. But the
protocols under which this work is done have been carefully
designed.
   ``The worst case scenario?'' muses Anderson, the father of gene
therapy who with other scientists has spent three years thinking of
the worst that can happen. ``I don't think anything that could
happen could surprise us. Short of a meteor coming through the
roof.''
   For years they will test for the chance that a recombinate virus
would emerge that is infectious and pathologic. But the chances are
so slim. After all the animal studies, Anderson says it would be a
``tremendous surprise because there is no place it could come from.
   ``The things that could happen, the thing that is most
worrisome, the thing that keeps me awake at night is that she (the
4-year-old patient) could run into a major problem which has
nothing to do with the therapy.''
   An air embolus during reinjection could get into the lung and
she could ``gasp three times and die. Unrelated to anything.''
   ``It would be a major setback for gene therapy,'' he says.
   Another possibility is that the therapy could unlock a
cancer-causing gene or stymie a cancer-inhibiting gene. The other
possibility is that the treatment could work too well and instead
of giving her gene-corrected cells in a uniform way would give her
spotty protection, leaving holes in her protection. As a result
they made the rules of the game ``so safe that it will be a year
before we know if we've done anything to help at all.''
   Dr. Michael Blaese, another member of the team, latched onto
lymphocytes as a vehicle for altered genes when work with blood
marrow cells proved too tricky. ``Until we have other tissues to
work with besides lymphocytes, the number of diseases we can work
with will be minimal,'' he says. ``When the bone marrow puzzle is
solved, then there will be many more diseases, but still a
relatively small number.''
   They tried originally to alter the genes in stem cells of the
blood marrow which would follow more natural pathways of immune
cells. But stem cells are quiet and reproduce only spasmodically.
Not enough of a response could be built up quickly or consistently.
   Which led to the lymphocyte approach.
   Which led to the next step which is to harness tumor necrosis
factor cells, some of the most potent killer cells in the immune
system. A gene transfer would make these cells multiply in the body
and greatly enhance the response to tumors.
   And the future for gene transfer? With further progress the
treatment of a number of gene-defective diseases - hemophilia,
cystic fibrosis, diabetes, to name a few. All stem from a genetic
deficiency in which nature failed to program the cells to produce
needed enzymes or proteins. Gene transfer can correct those
deficiencies.
   The most immediate weapon will be the use of altered genes in
lymphocytes to fight cancer, and facing the question of why some
patients respond and some do not.
   ``It's a very hard question to answer,'' says Rosenberg.
``People's cancers are different. Every cancer differs from every
other cancer and people are different...So the nature of their
tumors and the nature of their immunological responses are
relatively unique.
   ``Right now we are at the infancy of understanding what those
interactions are.
   ``I sort of put the development of these biological therapies to
where the Wright Brothers were in 1903. You know we've shown the
plane can get off the ground... But they weren't carrying
passengers, they weren't carrying mail. They only went 75 yards.
But they showed it was possible. What we've shown right now is that
it is possible.
   ``The challenge now is to make it more potent, more widely
applicable.''

   ``This is a philosophy that says progress is possible; that
government can be limited by the contract people agreed to enter
into,'' she says.
   She adds Adam Smith's thought that man is led ``by an invisible
hand'' to act in ways that benefit all of society.
   Minutes later she comes back to that thought and adds a personal
twist.
   In raising her three sons, she says, ``it took a very visible
hand to order my society.''
   The class chuckles and later a student comments:
   ``She always mentions her family, the fact she is a mother. One
way or the other she always brings it up.''
   As an American diplomat in a hostile world Jeane Kirkpatrick had
a rather austere public image, an image she largely retains.
   ``In fact she is surprisingly motherly,'' the student says.
``She says she takes pains at teaching because she wants to be as
good a teacher as she would have wanted her own sons to have when
they went to college.''
   ``She is remarkably available,'' says Robert Vanasse, a graduate
student from New Bedford, Conn. ``She's great at teaching...I never
would have gotten the idea or inspiration for my master's thesis
without direct support from her.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick never officially left the Georgetown faculty
during her United Nations years. She was on leave of absence
throughout the period.
   Would Jeane Kirkpatrick ever give up teaching and return to
public life?
   ``I'm not saying I never would,'' the professor of political
science replies. ``But I doubt it.''
   Since leaving the Reagan administration in 1985, the year she
switched her party affiliation from Democratic to Republican, Jeane
Kirkpatrick has been taking the temperature of change and plotting
its course and spelling out her conclusions in speeches and a
syndicated column that now runs in about 100 newspapers.
   She is using the column, ``a journal of the changes going on in
the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,'' as the basis for a book,
``The Withering Away of the Totalitarian State.''
   ``I was paying attention when I saw, early on, some basic
deviation and changes in Marxist-Leninist theory and practice,''
she says.
   ``I was saying Gorbachev was for real before a lot of people,''
says the professor, known as a scourge of the communist system. ``I
shocked a lot of people. But I was really watching it more
closely...It caused me to conclude that something really
fundamental was going on.''
   Where may the changes resulting from the collapse of communism
end?
   ``I think not only is the Cold War over, but it goes far beyond
that,'' she says. ``Nineteen eighty nine marked the year in which
the dog didn't bark. Gorbachev kept the troops in their barracks''
as the face of Eastern Europe changed.
   ``I know it's not over yet. But I think we've come to the end of
communism in Europe.
   ``What we learned was the Communist empire was sustained by
force. Force turned out to be the keystone of the arch. And when
force wasn't used, the whole structure collapsed.''
   Mrs. Kirkpatrick has lately been portrayed in some circles as
opposing President Bush's decision to rush troops to defend Saudi
Arabia in the aftermath of Iraq's August 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Some have lumped her with other conservatives - such as
commentator Patrick Buchanan - as embracing isolationism as the
Cold War thaws.
   She calls that a misunderstanding and says it occurred when she
responded to a question about Bush's Persian Gulf policy ``in an
academic rather than a political mode.''
   ``I said I did not believe the United States had a distinctive
national interest in the Gulf but that we shared an interest with a
good many other nations and because it was shared it was important
that we have a shared response,'' she says.
   As for President Bush?
   ``He is recognizing there are broad, shared, interacting
interests and is putting together an international coalition to
deal with the problem,'' she says.
   ``I am no kind of isolationist. I don't even think isolationism
is possible in the contemporary world.
   ``And if it was, I wouldn't be one.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Jeane Kirkpatrick first met Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987. She was not impressed.
   ``I was not charmed by Gorbachev,'' says the former U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations. ``But I did understand that he
was a very non-typical Soviet leader, very different as a human
type and as a political type.''
   About the same time she talked with Soviet dissident Andrei
Sakharov, who told her that Gorbachev was not only the Soviet
Union's best chance for reform but its only chance.
   Then there was glasnost.
   Always in the past Soviet leaders had treated opinion as a
reflection of one's position in the class struggle, Mrs.
Kirkpatrick says.
   ``If you believe opinions are an expression of class struggle,
someone who has a difference of opinion is really your enemy in an
ongoing class war,'' she says. ``Differences of opinion were
eliminated after the revolution. It led to all kinds of distortions
of reality in the Soviet Union.''
   Then, under Gorbachev's glasnost, differences of opinion were
suddenly legitimate.
   ``This is an absolutely heretical opinion,'' she says. ``It
opened the way for an enormous liberalization of the media.
   ``This was such a basic revision of Marxist doctrine that all my
antennae went up. They went `BOING.'
   ``I said, `If this man knows what he is doing, he is making a
major deviation.'
   ``We've literally had an earthquake.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Sales of kosher food products have mushroomed
dramatically in recent years and dozens of new kosher restaurants
are opening from coast to coast. One big reason, say rabis and
sociologists, is that young professional Jews are returning to
their orthodox religious roots.

<DATELINE>TEANECK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A kosher craze spreading across the country
has added a new word to the marketing lexicon.
   Fruppie. That's a Jewish yuppie who is ``fromm,'' the Yiddish
word for religious.
   And rabbis, sociologists and marketing consultants say the
number of fruppies is growing as Jewish baby boomers return to
their orthodox religious roots after experimenting with and
rejecting other lifestyles.
   ``Orthodox Jews today are far more visible than they were 10 or
15 years ago. They've come out of the shtetl,'' says Steve Ostrow
of Middletown, N.Y., who recently published a guide to 850 kosher
restaurants in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
   One of the measures of their growing numbers is an explosion in
sales of kosher foods.
   According to figures from Lubicom, a marketing company that
sponsors the International Kosher Food Trade Show twice a year in
New York City, the number of different kosher products available
has increased from 1,000 in 1977 to 20,000 this year. At the same
time, sales ballooned from $290 million to $1.75 billion a year as
companies from Coors beer to Pepperidge Farm have been awarded
kosher certification.
   Manufacturers pay an annual fee to supervisory agencies, the
largest of which is the Union of Orthodox Congregations, to inspect
their plants and certify products as kosher. Some have had to
reformulate recipes, switch to kosher ingredients and buy new
kitchen equipment.
   ``Certification has become a marketing tool,'' says Lubicom
president Menachem Lubinsky. ``Beer is inherently kosher, yet Coors
opted to try to obtain the symbol from the Orthodox Union.''
   But Lubinsky notes that only 1.5 million consumers of the 6
million who buy kosher products are Jewish. About 1.5 million are
Muslims and Seventh-day Adventists, whose religions also forbid
eating pork. The rest are vegetarians and others who buy kosher
food because they think it's healthier than non-kosher food.
   ``I, as a marketer, am astounded,'' Lubinsky says. But, he adds,
``It's consistent with the yuppie lifestyle. People are
entertaining more. They're going out to eat more.''
   ``Jews are the most affluent ethnic group in America,'' says
Queens College sociologist Steven Cohen. ``When you combine
affluence with education, you get upper-class and
upper-middle-class tastes.''
   Preparation of kosher food at home also has opened new markets.
   Here in Teaneck, a medium-sized suburb of New York City that is
home to about 1,500 Orthodox Jewish families, the latest fad is
kosher kitchens.
   For between $20,000 and $125,000, an ordinary kitchen can be
remodeled to make it easier to follow the dietary rules of
kashruth, which requires the complete separation of dairy and meat
products, from preparation to eating to cleanup. Families often buy
double sets of appliances, sinks and kitchen utensils.
   ``I wanted two dishwashers and more counter space, and I didn't
want to knock down walls,'' says Basheva Goldberg, who remodeled in
1984. ``I had to compromise on nothing.''
   Mrs. Goldberg called Lingold Design and Construction in Queens,
N.Y., and has since collaborated with owner David Linzer on dozens
of kosher kitchen projects throughout northern New Jersey, New York
and Connecticut.
   Linzer takes care of the nuts and bolts while Mrs. Goldberg, a
teacher of Jewish adult education, tells him what observant Jews
want in a kitchen.
   Exotic kosher food was born on Manhattan's Lower East Side in
1959 when Solomon Bernstein, the founder of Bernstein-on-Essex
kosher restaurant, decided o substitute veal for pork to make a
kosher eggroll.
   The repertoire was soon expanded with the help of Chinese chefs
to include other popular Cantonese dishes, with chicken and veal
replacing non-kosher shrimp and pork, says Bernstein's grandson,
Ira Rosenfeld.
   From that humble beginning, kosher restaurant fare has come a
long way from the borscht, chopped liver and chicken schmaltz that
were staples of the Russian and Eastern European Jewish shtetls, or
villages, before World War II.
   While the greatest concentration of kosher restaurants is in New
York City, more than 30 have opened in Los Angeles in the past five
years, according to Ostrow, the guidebook writer. And new kosher
eateries are popping up in Atlantic City, Miami, Chicago, San
Francisco and Brookline, Mass., he says.
   ``There's been a return to Jewish ritual,'' says Rabbi Menachem
Genack, head of the kashruth department at the Manhattan-based
Orthodox Union. ``People are coming back.''
   A major culinary sensation on the haute kosher circuit was the
introduction of kosher venison at Levana restaurant in Manhattan.
Deer meat had not been considered kosher because no one had made
arrangements for the kosher slaughter of the animals, says Levana
owner Sol Kirschenbaum.
   Under the many rules spelled out in the Torah and the Talmud,
animals that qualify as kosher must be killed by specially trained
rabbis. These shohets slit the animal's throat to minimize its
suffering and inspect the organs to ensure they are disease-free.
From animals that pass the rigorous inspection comes ``glatt''
kosher meat, the highest designation of purity in the kosher
universe.
   A year ago, Kirschenbaum arranged for a shohet to perform the
ritual slaughter on a deer farm in upstate New York.
   Describing himself as a ``b'alei t'shuva,'' or one who has
returned to the faith, the 39-year-old graduate of City College of
New York says he is typical of a generation of Jews who were raised
in secular homes but became more religious than their parents.
   ``We got spoiled by fine foods and fine wines. We had eaten at
Lutece and the Four Seasons,'' he says, referring to two of
Manhattan's fine restaurants. ``When we opened the restaurant, we
decided we would try to serve what was current and spectacular, not
traditional kosher food.''
   About 10 percent of the 5.9 million Jews in the United States
are Orthodox, according to the American Jewish Committee. Cohen
estimates the kosher-keeping population at between 500,000 and 1.8
million, depending on one's definition of kosher.
   Many Jews with only one set of dishes don't feel comfortable
eating non-kosher ham and bacon, while the most observant will buy
only those dairy products labeled ``cholov yisroel,'' which means
that the milking and the processing were supervised by an Orthodox
Jew.
   The most marked difference today in the American Jewish
community, says Cohen, is that Jews across the religious spectrum
feel more intensely Jewish.
   ``My grandparents who were observant gave birth to parents who
are less so,'' he says. ``Now our generation is more ideologically
Jewish.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - It was a rollicking city with wide-open gambling
and a race track, a European-style spa in America's Southland. But
the tourist trade in Hot Springs cooled off in recent years, after
the casinos were shut down, and most of the bathhouses closed. Now
the city is taking on a new look with a burgeoning colony of
artists.

   Across from Bathhouse Row, new art
galleries hold the paintings and sculptures of local and
international artists. At Magee's Cafe, poets from 8 to 87 years
old gather each week to read their works to standing-room-only
crowds.
   This old spa, where once the high and the low came to take the
waters, bet the horses and party the night away, is enjoying a
cultural renaissance. A burgeoning colony of artists is
revitalizing the run-down downtown area.
   The artists colony is centered on Central Avenue, across from
the two-block row of nine Mediterranean-style thermal bathhouses,
built between 1892 and 1936 and now designated a National Historic
Landmark District.
   The city for decades was a wide-open mecca for gamblers. Al
Capone and rival gangsters came to relax under a truce. Then in
1967 Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller sent in the state police to shut
down the casinos.
   This city of about 33,000 people, adjacent to Hot Springs
National Park, has been in economic decline since.
   Getting into hot water is not as popular as it once was. By late
October, only about 22,000 people had partaken of the mineral baths
this year, as compared with more than 100,000 in 1978.
   Only one of the baths on Bathhouse Row is open for business,
owned by the National Park Service and leased to a private
operator, as is one other public bathhouse, the Libbey Memorial
Medical Center and Spa, which is not on the Row.
   But now those empty storefronts which blighted the downtown area
are being rejuvenated by the artists moving into the city.
   Joe Orlando, a sculptor who works in bronze, moved from Dallas
in April. He is establishing a foundry for fine arts in a 1911
two-story building near the downtown area. The foundry will pour
bronze for artists' works, and Orlando says he hopes to attract
sculptors from around the world.
   A growing number of gallery owners also have moved in, buying up
at bargain prices the turn-of-the-century stores and warehouses
across the street from Bathhouse Row. They have turned the
buildings into showcases and studios for artists.
   On the first Thursday of each month, the doors open for an
informal gallery walk, an unstructured tour of the exhibits in Hot
Springs' seven fine-arts galleries and 14 arts-related studios and
museums.
   Malinda Herr-Chambliss, owner of the Herr-Chambliss gallery, has
displayed sculptures from artists in Holland and Iceland. She has
shown works from Romania, Little Rock, Italy and Jonesboro.
   She estimates that 1,500 people, mostly Hot Springs residents,
roam the galleries when they open for the monthly walks.
   In Magee's Cafe, a lectern is crammed into a corner in what used
to be the carriage house of an 1871-vintage store. Weekly poetry
readings at the cafe, going on now for almost two years, draw a
diverse crowd of artists and pseudo-poets, children and their
mothers.
   It is a place where the patrons know almost everyone who walks
in the door.
   Those who come in for the evening bring their spiral notebooks,
which lay open on tables. They scribble words as they listen to
others who have stepped up to the microphone to read.
   On this night, Robert Brummer, 58, intermittently naps and
writes on a napkin. Sometimes, he will add his name to the list,
step forward to the podium and read the words he's written that
evening. On this night, he's dressed in a red velvet dinner jacket,
the large lapels trimmed in black. He sports a black top hat.
   Carrie Jamison is 87 and serious about her poetry. She moved to
Hot Springs in the 1930s, when she made her living as a masseuse in
the city's hot mineral baths. She wears a large plumed hat and
flowered skirt and shares her table with a woman who will read her
own poetry in French.

   ``I think this is the most wonderful thing that could happen to
Hot Springs,'' Ms. Jamison says. ``If these galleries can survive,
it will bring other cultural things to this town. It's changing the
whole tone of the town.''
   John Eagleheart plays his guitar for the cafe's audience. A
visitor from Scotland offers songs from her homeland. A massage
therapist reads a fairy tale, and brings tears to his own eyes.
   Paul Tucker, known as the singing neurologist, reads Robert
Browning.
   Bud Kenny, who two years ago walked from Pennsylvania to
California with a dog and a pack horse, moderates the evening's
lineup, which is carried live on radio station KBHS.
   A key figure in the Hot Springs art scene is a painter named
Benini.
   Benini - he uses no other name - sat on a couch for a recent
interview, beneath a huge, heavy-lined portrait of himself. Two
small braids tied in black ribbon reached to his beard.
   He is cited by many in the community as the driving force behind
Hot Springs' renaissance.
   Benini moved to Hot Springs in September 1988 from Central
Florida. He and his wife, Lorraine, were returning from an exhibit
of Benini's works at a Fort Smith arts center when they took a
wrong turn off the interstate, he says.
   ``I was blown away by the old elegance and beauty at night,''
Benini says. ``Night is very beautiful in old cities.''
   Benini, 49, left his hometown of Imola, Italy, when he was 14.
He said Hot Springs reminds him of the Italian countryside; the
baths remind him of Europe.
   The environment allows him the peace to pursue what has become
his passion during the last three to five years - bright acrylics
and three-dimensional geometric shapes that spill from the canvas.
   Artists who have moved to Hot Springs, some at Benini's urging,
say Hot Springs' appeal is manifold: It's undiscovered. It's
reminiscent of Europe. The mountains are enticing. And the hot
baths are a curiosity.
   ``It's probably the most European spa atmosphere in the United
States,'' says Paul Sullivan, a curator with the National Park
Service.
   About five blocks from Central Avenue, in an elementary school
turned studio, Jeanfo, a sculptor originally from the south of
France, welds steel in a cavernous gym. Some 250 steel sculptures,
from 3 to 7 feet tall, line the hallways of Jeanfo Studios.
   ``This is something very different, because the environment is
not the same,'' Jeanfo says. ``People are not the same. In New
York, there are too-sophisticated people who know, perhaps, too
much about art.''
   And it's cheap. Jeanfo says buying the same amount of space in
France, New York or the West Coast would have cost 10 times as
much.
   Low overhead for gallery owners allowed them to drop their
commission to 33 percent, instead of the 67 percent that is
standard in New York, says gallery owner Debrah Phillips.
   ``When I came up here from Florida, people thought I was
committing professional suicide,'' Ms. Herr-Chambliss says. But her
gallery is booked through May 1991, she says.
   Paul Tucker, a Hot Springs doctor, and his wife, Suzanne,
restored four buildings and donated the use of one of them to the
non-profit Hot Springs Arts Center for five years.
   ``There's a much more eclectic collection of art here than in
other places,'' Tucker says.
   But even before the arts came in, Tucker says, Hot Springs was
an unusal town.
   ``This was a town with open gambling. This was a town with open
prostitution. It has one of the biggest race tracks. So it's always
been unusual.
   ``Even before the arts, it was a city of complexity.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The sadistic murder of a teen-ager was the stuff
of horror movies, played out in the rolling wheat fields of the
Texas Panhandle. Charged with the murder is a 19-year-old who once
told a friend his heroes were serial killers Ted Bundy, Charles
Manson and Jack the Ripper. And while he awaits trial, local
residents worry that there will be other attacks by other
satanists.

<TEXT>
   It was Friday the 13th, a steamy night
in July, when 17-year-old Frankie Garcia was taken to a barn
outside an abandoned shack known locally as the ``Haunted House''
to meet his death.
   Witnesses who found the body say Garcia apparently was forced to
kneel in the dirt and taste the barrel of a high-powered
.223-caliber rifle as his killer pulled the trigger.
   Local residents were shocked when word got out that a
self-professed satanist had confessed to the murder.
   Kenneth Glenn Milner, a 19-year-old admirer of Charles Manson
and Jack the Ripper, has been charged with murdering Garcia, a
former friend. He is also charged with the attempted murders of
Kenneth Williams, his former high school principal, and Jimmy
Britten, a former girlfriend's stepfather, that same night.
   The 2,300 people who live in this farming town worry that there
will be other attacks. Parents closely watch their children,
keeping them off the dirt roads that crisscross the rolling wheat
fields of the region.
   ``There is fear that there are more satanists out there,'' says
Linda Salas, who has four children. ``There are rumors that they
are looking for a blond-haired, blue-eyed boy to sacrifice.''
   Milner has been held without bond in the Carson County Jail
since his arrest the day after Garcia's killing, a killing a friend
says Milner bragged about committing.
   ``He said he shot Williams and then said, `I finished off
Frankie Garcia,''' says 16-year-old Carrie Horner. ``Then he took a
gun out and shot a hole through the window of his car to prove he
was serious.''
   Carson County District Attorney David McCoy, who will seek the
death penalty, said Milner gave police a written confession in
which he said he wanted to die.
   ``Mr. Milner has indicated a strong desire to die and I intend
to do all I can to see his wishes are accommodated,'' McCoy said.
   Court-appointed defense attorney Douglas Woodburn of Amarillo
says the trial could begin as early as January but he will likely
seek a change of venue.
   ``There has been extensive publicity of the case and Panhandle
is a small town,'' Woodburn says. ``And it's a common notion of
fair play that everyone should start off in a trial with no
preconceived ideas of the case.''
   As for the rumors that satanism was involved, Woodburn says, ``I
don't think that's a guiding influence in his life, but I just
don't know.''
   Carson County Sheriff Terry Timmons would not permit an
interview with Milner. Milner's parents, who run a bar called
``Shirley's'' just outside of Panhandle, would not discuss the case
or their only son.
   But Milner's friends say he is obsessed with death and spent
countless hours watching horror movies, reading books about Satan
and creating special effects like those used in slasher movies.
   ``He knew every horror movie by heart,'' says 18-year-old
Katrina Powell, who lived next door to Milner for 14 years. ``He
would make masks of characters in the horror movies - grotesque
masks - like with blood and an eyeball hanging out.''
   Craig Shackelford, 16, Milner's best friend, said his pal
frequently discussed creating an illusion of shooting a person
through the mouth.
   Milner imagined attaching a low-power plastic explosive to the
back of someone's head, sticking a gun in their mouth, and
simultaneously pulling the trigger and setting off the explosives
to make it appear the person had been shot, Shackelford said.
   ``He wanted to know what that would look like,'' he said.
   Shackelford said Milner has a ``twisted sense of humor,'' loves
to ``scare the hell out of people'' and enjoys notoriety.
   Milner's bedroom is lined with black, ghoulish posters from
horror movies, Shackleford said. He said the room also contains a
clay corpse Milner made to test his special effects and a cast of
his own head, covered with a demon mask.
   Milner wrote Shackelford from his jail cell, chastising his
``best - closest friend'' for not writing. ``I'm not going to shoot
you through the Postal Service or anything,'' he joked.
   ``Glenn wasn't normal,'' Shackelford said. ``But I don't think
he was a satanist either.''
   ``Glenn read the Bible from cover to cover. He read other books
too, like the Necronomican and stuff about astral projection. He
didn't know what to believe, so he would explore.'' The
Necronomican is a handbook of spells that supposedly summon demons.

   Shackelford said Milner told him some of his heroes were Ted
Bundy, Charles Manson and Jack the Ripper.
   ``Glenn admired Jack the Ripper because he was never caught,''
he said.
   Friends and school officials say Milner was a well-behaved
student through grade school, but began showing signs of depression
in high school.
   ``He started to drink more,'' Ms. Powell says. ``And sometimes
when he would get angry, he would slice up his arms with a knife.''
   In the spring of 1988, Milner climbed to the top of a water
tower and threatened to jump. Police talked him out of it.
   A few months later, while driving alone, he ran his car over a
cliff at Palo Duro Canyon. After being treated for injuries, his
friends say he was placed in psychiatric care at Northwest Texas
Hospital in Amarillo. The hospital refused to confirm Milner's
stay.
   ``Glenn and I talked about the times he tried to kill himself a
lot,'' Shackelford says. ``He did it because he wanted to know what
was on the other side.''
   An entry Milner wrote in Shackelford's high school yearbook the
day before Garcia was killed leads Shackelford to believe Milner
planned the alleged attacks.
   ``Your wisdom and advice have helped me out many times,'' Milner
wrote. ``Wish it could on the problem that I face now - wish I
could tell you, but you'll find out sooner or later.''
   The entry was signed ``Damion,'' the misspelled name of the
Antichrist in a series of horror films.
   ``He liked people to call him Damien,'' Shackelford says. ``He
liked people to take a step back when he introduced himself as
Damien.''
   Those who knew Garcia and Milner say they were not very good
friends.
   ``Frankie really got on Glenn's nerves,'' said Ron Doty, 19, a
companion of both. ``Frankie tried really hard to be everyone's
friend.''
   So when Milner invited Garcia to go out on the town on Friday
the 13th, Garcia told Shackelford he was skeptical.
   ``Glenn doesn't even like me does he?'' Shackelford quoted
Garcia as saying in a telephone conversation a couple hours before
he was killed. ``He just wants to take me out and pull a prank on
me - scare the hell out of me.''
   Police say Garcia was killed about 10 p.m. About 10:30 p.m.
Shackelford and Doty noticed Milner speeding out of town. After
cathing up with Milner, Shackelford said he asked his friend what
he was doing.
   Both Doty and Shackelford recall Milner responding, ``I just got
done taking care of some business. I've got to go take care of some
more.''
   Britten, whose stepdaughter Jenny English once dated Milner,
says Milner slashed his throat and arms with a straight razor
shortly after 1 a.m. on July 14.
   Ms. English said Milner began vomiting during the attack,
allowing Britten to overpower him.
   Two hours later, three shots were fired from a .357-caliber
Magnum revolver through a door at Ken Williams, Milner's former
high school principal.
   Williams was struck in the leg and abdomen, authorities said.
The other shot missed.
   Both Williams and Britten are recovering.
   Milner did not like the way Britten treated his stepdaughter and
he thought Williams was spreading rumors about him to other kids in
the high school, Shackelford said.
   Milner also left behind a ``hit list'' of intended victims and a
videotape detailing his motives and plans, according to his friends
who have been questioned by police.
   Four days after the attacks, state District Judge John T. Forbis
placed a gag order on attorneys and investigators.
   Shackelford says he doubts if Milner cares what happens to him
now.
   ``I think he would have committed suicide eventually,''
Shackelford said. ``I think he wants to die. I think the death
penalty would probably please him.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - If many communities have ``bookmobiles'' that
deliver library books to various neighborhoods, Alaska has taken
the program a big step further. In a special state-operated
service, books are delivered by air to families far out in the
bush. For many of them it is their main source of entertainment and
education.

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the back country of Alaska, out of
the reach of television, commercial radio or even daily newspapers,
thousands of families are staying in touch the old-fashioned way.
   They're reading books.
   Bush pilots regularly fly library books to some 3,000 Alaskans
to fulfill a promise dating from territorial days that all
residents should have equal access to public libraries.
   For people such as Elaine and Pete Velsko and their two
daughters, who live on Tutka Bay, 125 miles from Anchorage, those
green mailbags full of books, which arrive once or twice a month,
offer both education and entertainment.
   ``My husband asks for all non-fiction. He wants to keep up with
the world,'' Elaine Velsko says. ``But I like my stories. If I
didn't get my green bags, I think I'd perish out here.''
   Mrs. Velsko has spent 13 years on Tutka Bay, 14 miles from
Homer, managing her modern ranch home and teaching her children,
ages 8 and 4, through correspondence courses. Her husband runs the
state fish hatchery nearby.
   The way some people might flick on a soap opera, she'll pull a
novel out of the sack and read.
   ``We are living more the pioneering life,'' she says. ``It's
what we want.''
   About 175 miles north, in the village of Skwentna, Joe and Norma
Delia have spent 40 years on their 10-acre homestead hunting,
trapping, running the post office and reading flown-in library
books to their two children.
   ``For my kids, books were a big thing in their lives,'' Joe
Delia says. ``They didn't have things that kids in town have to
occupy their time.''
   Begun in 1957, Alaska's bush library service operated for more
than a decade out of the state library at Juneau. But it
specialized in historical and government material and, for readers,
wasn't the same as being able to browse a library shelf or
bookstore for a good read.
   George Smith, who oversees the $265,000 state grant that pays
for the service's postage and library staff, says the service was
transferred 10 years ago to the public libraries at Juneau,
Fairbanks and Anchorage to give readers a chance at more
contemporary collections.
   Only a fraction of the estimated 40,000 people who live in rural
Alaska are signed up for books by mail.
   One of them is writer Janice Schofield. From her one-room cabin
in the Rocky River Valley near Homer, Schofield began a study of
grasses and flowers and was inspired to write a book on Alaska's
native plants.
   Her reference guides were almost exclusively library books
delivered by mail plane and left for her at a remote mail shed on
Kantishna Bay.
   ``It was always great - like having this little goody box coming
in the mail,'' she says.
   To fetch the books, Schofield and her husband, Edward, hiked or
skied to their car, drove to the end of the road, and then hiked or
skied another half-mile to reach the shed. There the books went
into backpacks and the Schofields made their way back out.
   ``Discovering Wild Plants,'' published last year by Northwest
Discovery Publications, was the first book she ever researched by
mail, letting the library know generally what she needed and then
waiting to see what turned up.
   Most people in the bush want popular fiction, children's books
and popular non-fiction, Smith says.
   ``They tell us what they want - either they give us titles or
they just specify a subject - and then we choose the collections,''
he says.
   Joe Delia, who says he'll often rise at 3 a.m. to finish a Louis
L'Amour novel or maybe a spy thriller by Robert Ludlum, has been a
patron of the bush library service for at least 20 years, longer
than almost anyone else. Once in a while, he says, he'll open a
fresh sack of six or 10 books only to find he's already read them.
   ``The more I read the more I want to read,'' says Delia, 59.
   ``When we had nothing to read in the trap line cabins - and this
is no joke - we'd read the labels on cans.
   ``I used to be able to tell you all the ingredients in a can of
Carnation milk. I didn't pronounce it all correctly, but I knew
them.''
   In Juneau or Fairbanks or Anchorage, where a computer helps
track the book requests, librarians too can follow a family's
progress by the books they want. After a few years of being a
family's personal book-shopper, library workers get Christmas cards
or friendly notes.
   ``We keep up a lot of correspondence,'' says Brenda Bergsrud,
who works with the program at Anchorage's Z.J. Loussac Library.
   ``A parent will write and say, `Tanya likes horses, so send us
horse books.' And then Tanya will send us a picture of a horse. We
start to feel like family.''

   Will Smith keeps a chessboard handy on the
set of NBC's ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air.'' But like the character he
plays, what he'd really like is a pool table.
   Smith, a Grammy-winning rap singer known as Fresh Prince,
frequently plays chess when he's not working on his new NBC comedy
series. The show is his acting and television debut in the role of
a tough street kid from Philadelphia sent to live with wealthy
relatives in Bel Air.
   The comedy hinges on his attempts to adjust to the alien
environment of wealth and excess, and to bring his relatives back
in touch with their humbler roots.
   The 21-year-old Smith's frequent chess opponent is Joe Marcell,
who plays Geoffrey the butler as though he's just stepped out of
``Masterpiece Theatre.'' They've also had a game on an episode of
the comedy series.
   ``I play a lot of chess, but I don't know if I could say it's a
passion,'' Smith says. ``Pool is more of a passion with me. I put
in a request for a pool table on the set.''
   Smith sees a similarity between himself and his character, also
named Will Smith and nicknamed Fresh Prince. Smith also comes from
the Philadelphia area and says he prefers not to fit in.
   ``I've never done any acting,'' he says. ``I've never had any
formal theatrical training whatsoever. I'm playing a character I
designed five years ago for my rap concerts. It's pretty much a
part of me now.''
   Smith, like his character, is a person who smoothes the way with
incredible charm and an ability to think - and talk - fast. On the
screen he seems at ease and natural, although his lack of training
and experience occasionally surfaces in scenes with other cast
members.
   Prior to its premiere in September, NBC ballyhooed the show as
its breakaway hit of the seasn. As often happens to highly touted
young racehorses, it stumbled coming out of the gate. ABC's ``Cop
Rock'' stumbled even more so, as did ABC's ``Chicken Soup'' last
year.
   In the ratings for its first weeks ``Fresh Prince'' has been
barely ahead of its Monday night competition, CBS' ``Uncle Buck''
and ABC's ``McGyver,'' and trailing ABC's NFL Monday Night
Football.
   Part of the problem may be that the audience apparently is not
reacting well to Smith's making fun of middle-class values. As a
result, some of the sharper edges of the humor are being honed
down.
   ``Fresh Prince,'' like NBC's ``Ferris Bueller,'' which
immediately follows it, is part of television's trend of
youth-oriented comedies - replacing ``sitcom'' with ``punk-com.''
In such shows, including NBC's ``Hull High'' and Fox's ``Parker
Lewis Can't Loose,'' wisecracking kids outsmart slow-witted adults.
   Among those hoping that Smith's ``Fresh Prince'' recording and
stage performance success will transfer to a new audience is 20th
Century Fox, which recently signed him for an action-adventure
movie.
   Smith picked up the nickname Prince in school. It has nothing to
do with rock singer Prince.
   ``My eighth-grade teacher started calling me Prince and it sort
of stuck,'' he says. ``She did that because I was a pretty charming
guy. I had a couple of different names. I don't remember all of
them. When you're rapping you change your name every week trying to
find one that fits. Once I was Willie Will. I settled on Prince in
1986, then I added Fresh because that's the new slang for cool.
   ``I was performing rap at parties by 1981 and getting paid for
it. I always did rap. I play a little piano and guitar.''
   His rap partner was Jeff Townes, and by 1986 they had become
D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince. Their first single was ``Girls
Ain't Nothin' But Trouble,'' which they recorded on their own label
and sold nearly 200,000 copies in Pennsylvania, Delaware and New
Jersey. A major company picked it up and it became an international
hit.
   They've since recorded three albums, one of which sold 3 million
copies. A fourth album is due out next year.
   ``Fresh Prince is not very different from Will Smith,'' he says.
``He's fun-loving, mischievous and very handsome. He's just a sweet
fellow. It's me, not a character. It's just me, rapping or acting.
   ``Rap is the only real musical art form we have in America now,
other than jazz. You can listen to Elvis Presley and other stuff.
It's all stolen from black Americans. Elvis is nothing but bits of
Little Richard and Chuck Berry.
   ``Rap is more expressive and more individual. You have to write
your own material because rap comes from the heart. I'd never sing
anyone else's song.''
   Smith says the show is loosely based on the life of Benny
Medina, a record company executive who is a co-producer of the
series.
   ``He literally went from the streets to Beverly Hills High
School in the span of a weekend,'' Smith says of Medina, who
recommended that the ``Fresh Prince'' of rap music would be a
natural TV character.
   ``He saw my music video and never considered anyone else,''
Smith says.

   Lonny Price is doing double duty these days - as
director of ``The Rothschilds'' and a star of ``Falsettoland,'' two
off-Broadway musical hits.
   Well, maybe that's triple or quadruple duty. He's also appearing
on the television soap opera ``Loving,'' playing a district
attorney, and in what's left of his spare time, he's trying to
write several musicals, including one about that celebrated
Catskills family, the Grossingers.
   But every night, you'll see him down at the Lucille Lortel
Theater playing Mendel, the psychiatrist in ``Falsettoland,''
William Finn's acclaimed musical about coming to terms with life in
the age of AIDS.
   The Lortel is a five-minute walk from the Circle in the Square
Downtown where a revival of ``The Rothschilds,'' Price's latest
directorial effort, is running.
   When ``The Rothschilds,'' a musical about the famous European
banking dynasty, first opened in New York in 1970, it was one of
the most lavish productions Broadway had ever seen.
   Price first directed the show last winter off-off-Broadway in
the basement of a West Side supermarket, on a playing area no
bigger than most New York bathrooms.
   ``It was an impossible stage,'' Price says. ``But that's the
best thing about directing. Instead of worrying about how I'm
doing, I worry about how the actors are doing. You become a problem
solver. It takes your mind off yourself.''
   ``The Rothschilds'' was so successful it was moved to the larger
theater. And Price has had to juggle a new career in the theater -
a field he has been passionate about all his life.
   ``My mom was crazy for musicals,'' he says. So is her son.
   Price, born in New York and raised in Queens and New Jersey, saw
his first Broadway show at age 3. He sat on a couple of phone books
to watch a Saturday matinee of ``Oliver!''
   ``If you don't want your little boy to be on stage, don't take
him to `Oliver!','' Price advises. ``All those kids having such a
good time up there.''
   He was the kind of star-struck teen-ager who took his bar
mitzvah money - some $3,000 - and put it in Broadway musicals
rather than savings bonds or electric guitars.
   Over a period of several years, Price and family invested in six
shows. On some, like the Angela Lansbury revival of ``Gypsy,'' he
made a little money. On others, like Stephen Sondheim's ``Pacific
Overtures,'' he lost it all.
   Price has been writing fan letters to Sondheim since he was 13,
after he saw ``Company.'' ``He was my absolutely favorite Broadway
composer,'' Price recalls. ``He was like my Mick Jagger.'' And
Sondheim wrote back. Even today, they still correspond two or three
times a year.
   Sondheim put Price in touch with producer Harold Prince, who
gave him a job backstage working on ``Pacific Overtures,'' a
musical about the opening of Japan to the West.
   ``I copied scripts, kept them up to date and did everything but
get coffee,'' Price says.
   The day before ``Pacific Overtures'' was to open on Broadway,
the show's rickshaw was stolen. Price was told to stay at the
theater and protect the set.
   ``I was 15 and probably shorter than I am now,'' he says. ``I
sat in the dark on the stage of the Winter Garden Theater, guarding
the set. Now if anyone had come and taken anything, I don't know
what I would have done.''
   Price eventually was fired from ``Pacific Overtures'' - a
volunteer job - because one of Prince's assistants said the eager
youth was asking too many questions.
   But that didn't sour his enthusiasm for Broadway.
   He attended the Performing Arts High School in New York, the
school made famous by ``Fame.''
   ``After that I went to Juilliard for a year and dropped out -
and have been working ever since,'' Price says. But he wanted to be
an actor, not a producer or director or someone behind the scenes.
   Price got a job in an off-Broadway play called ``Class Enemy,''
a drama about teen-agers in London's East End. The play ran for
seven months and won him a Theater World award as a promising
newcomer.
   He left to do the workshop of a new musical and was seen by
Sondheim, who learned Price could sing.
   That may have helped him get a role in ``Merrily We Roll
Along,'' an unsuccessful Sondheim show that many consider one of
the composer's most accomplished scores.
   ``It was the best time of my life,'' Price says. ``You can
understand, from my background, how much appearing in a Sondheim
musical meant to me. Prince and Sondheim were my heroes. Getting
them to write a song for me was great.''
   But it was also a painful, difficult experience, so much so that
Price hasn't seen any of the revivals of the musical that have
played around the country in recent years. The show played only 16
performances in 1981 but lives on in a wonderful RCA cast
recording.
   ``I would like to have grown in the role but the rug was pulled
out from under us,'' Price says. Despite the musical's quick
demise, he never gave up the theater.
   In fact, Price has turned down a half-dozen television shows
over the years, three in the last 12 months, to continue to do
stage work.
   ``They offer me a lot of money to do something pretty dopey, and
I really don't want to do it. I don't like sitcoms, which is mostly
what I get offered. Roles like the best friend of the hero or real
nerds. Totally uninteresting except that you make enough money to
never have to work again.
   ``It's a real challenge every time one of them rears its head.
But I say `no.' I'd really rather be on stage or direct.''

   Let's all get scared. After all, it's the season of fright, the
time to scream, the hour of the witch. Let your living room be the
den of horror for your Halloween frightfest.
   There are lots of scary movies available on video for the home
viewer. Please note that not all are for the casual viewer; many
are for hardcore horror fans.
   Here is the first part of an alphabetical list of some of what's
available on video for Halloween. Tune in next week for more:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The Abominable Dr. Phibes'' (1971): Vincent Price gets a nose
job and seeks revenge. With some funny bits and a little help from
Terry-Thomas, Hugh Griffin and Joseph Cotton.
   ``Alison's Birthday'' (1984): A nasty 19th birthday celebration
for Alison, who's father's ghost has warned her to stay away. Oh
well.
   ``The Amityville Horror'' (1979): Forget this borish movie.
About as frightening as Bugs Bunny in an Amusement Park. Even
worse, its two sequels.
   ``And Now the Screaming Starts'' (1973): A Peter Cushing
bloodfest. Eerie and scary British film.
   ``Angel Heart'' (1987): Very bloody, vague and occasionally
vapid. Nice cameo by Robert De Niro. More sleaze from the sleaze
king, Mickey Rourke. With Lisa Bonet and lots of violence.
   ``The Believers'' (1987): A voodoo cult runs rampant in New
York. Not bad.
   ``The Birds'' (1963): Excellent Hitchcock eerie and scary
thriller. Don't mess with your fine, feathered friends.
   ``The Black Cat'' (1934): Stylish and surrealistic scare flick
teaming Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. A bloody concept at the end,
with not much shown. Paired on video with another Karloff-Lugosi
winner, ``The Raven.'' Classics worth owning, and horror movies the
way they should be - thoughtful and unsettling.
   ``The Black Room'' (1935): Karloff as twins with family curse.
   ``Black Sabbath'' (1964): A trilogy of horror tales. Pretty good
stuff.
   ``Blood Beach'' (1981): The challenge here is to keep from
laughing as hapless beach bunnies are mysteriously sucked into the
sand and killed. A real clunker.
   ``Blood on Satan's Claw'' (1971): Satan and witchcraft in
17th-century England. A good fright.
   ``Bride of Frankenstein'' (1935): Not very scary, but stylish
and snappy. Stars Elsa Lanchester as the bride and Karloff as
you-know-who.
   ``Burnt Offerings'' (1976): Strange and disjointed haunted house
tale, with Bette Davis, Oliver Reed and Karen Black as the doomed
family.
   ``Cameron's Closet'' (1989): OK, you're warned. Don't go into
Cameron's closet. What you did? Oops. Not a bad supernatural
thriller. Worth a watch.
   ``Carnival of Souls'' (1962): A scary little zombie thriller set
in Kansas.
   ``Carrie'' (1976): Sloppily directed film version of
best-selling Stephen King novel, by Brian De Palma. Worth seeing
for performances by Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie.
   ``Cat People'' (1942): The curse of the panther played out in
the imagination. Well done.
   ``Cat People'' (1982): 40 years later, filmmakers decided to add
sex, nudity, an irritating synthetic soundtrack and lots and lots
of blood. Not worth the bother.
   ``Cat's Eye'' (1985): Scary story trilogy. Kind of neat.
   ``The Changeling'' (1979): Good, solid ghost story. Lots of
chills and first-rate cast: George C. Scott, Trish Van Devere,
Melvyn Douglas.
   ``Child's Play'' (1988): Watch out for your ankles and don't
play with talking dolls. Amusing and a tad disarming.
   ``Count Dracula'' (1970): Christopher Lee bares his fangs.
   ``The Crawling Eye'' (1958): Old-fashioned horror - you don't
know what's out there until the end of the movie. Scary.
   ``Curse of the Demon'' (1958): A compelling and frightening
classic about a devil cult.
   ``The Curse of the Werewolf'' (1961): Oliver Reed as the
four-legged critter.
   ``Damien: Omen II'' (1978): Damien (the Antichrist) grows up,
and the specter of death hovers over his family. Sequel to ``The
Omen.''
   ``Dawn of the Dead'' (1979): Not for the squeamish, as corpses
feast on a human buffet.
   ``Day of the Dead'' (1985): The third sequel to ``Night of the
Living Dead.'' Don't bother.
   ``Dead of Night'' (1945): A horror anthology from England, and
worth seeing on a stormy night.
   ``The Devil Doll'' (1936): Lionel Barrymore goes in drag with
his army of tiny people to seek revenge against those who destroyed
him.
   ``The Devil's Rain'' (1975): A not-so-bad movie about devil
worshippers. Stars Ernest Borgnine and Tom Skerritt.
   ``Dr. Terror's House of Horrors'' (1965): Good anthology
starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.
   ``Dracula'' (1931): The best. The very best. Bravo Lugosi.
   ``The Dunwich Horror'' (1970): Anything with Sandra Dee in it is
an automatic horror. Skip this one.
   ``The Evil'' (1978): A haunted house with Satan.
   ``The Exorcist'' (1973): Pea soup and twirling heads. Great
stuff. Skip the sequel, ``Exorcist II: The Heretic.''
   ``Fall of the House of Usher'' (1960): Vincent Price in haunted
house tale based on Edgar Allan Poe story.
   ``Frankenstein'' (1931): The Karloff classic. A real sweet,
misunderstood guy.
   ``Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man'' (1943): Lugosi plays Frankie
this time around. Lon Chaney Jr. reprises his Wolf Man role. Not
bad.
   ``Friday the 13th'' (and six sequels): Lighten up, Jason.
   ``Fright Night'' (1985): Sophisticated, amusing and scary
vampire tale. See it.

   ``Stray'' (Sire-Reprise) - Aztec Camera
   
   Aztec Camera's excellent fourth album showcases the versatility
of Roddy Frame, the English group's songwriter, singer, guitarist
and co-producer.
   The nine songs on ``Stray'' range from the melancholoy title
ballad to jazzy instrumentals to the angry rock of ``Good Morning
Britain'' with ex-Clash member Mick Jones.
   The first single, ``The Crying Scene,'' is a gem that combines
in one eminently danceable construction the album's two main
themes: the pain of love lost and the importance of pushing on
through adversity.
   After three spotty releases from Aztec Camera, ``Stray'' is a
consistently strong album that shows why some of Britain's leading
songwriters, including Elvis Costello, have long championed Frame.
   ---&equals;
   ``Black Sheets of Rain'' (Virgin) - Bob Mould
   
   The title of Bob Mould's second solo album is a dead giveaway
that it won't follow in the subtle, melodic vein that made last
year's ``Workbook'' such a big surprise.
   ``Black Sheets'' has its gentle moments but it is mostly a dark,
brooding work dominated by Mould's roaring vocals and swirling
guitar.
   The music sounds loud even when played at low volume, an
achievement that recalls Mould's old thrash band, Husker Du. Mould
is again joined here by drummer Anton Fier of the Golden Palominos
and Pere Ubu bassist Tony Maimone, his sidemen on ``Workbook.''
   Mould's emotional intensity pierces through the noise, making
such songs as the environmental lament ``It's too Late'' and the
lover's plea ``One Good Reason'' memorable.
   ``Black Sheets of Rain'' proves once again that Mould is more
than a big guy with a scary voice and a bunch of amplifiers. The
fruits of his uncompromising efforts may not always be sweet but
they are consistently interesting.

   You can run your hands over the crazy quilt and
twirl the propeller on the 19th-century whirligig in an American
folk art exhibit that is turning common museum practice on its
head.
   ``Bringing Folk Art Closer'' is the first exhibit created as
part of Access to Art, a program designed to make the arts
available to all museum visitors. The show, now at the Baltimore
Museum of Art, features examples of folk art in a variety of media
- pottery, sculpture, textiles, furniture and painting. It marks
the first time any objects have been presented for touch in a major
folk art exhibition.
   The display, an overview of American folk art, is the brainchild
of Irma Shore, director of Access to Art. She is losing her sight
and believes a few steps can make many types of art available to
people who are in wheelchairs, deaf or vision-impaired.
   ``The idea really was to create an exhibit that would be
available to all ages and abilities,'' Shore said. ``It's not about
people with disabilities or for people with disabilities but to
create an exhibit that can be experienced by everyone.
   ``Touching enhances people's understanding of art and art
objects. Touching seems to draw people a lot closer to the objects.
I think it breaks down the barriers that people sometimes feel in
an art museum.''
   The pieces of folk art were selected from a special collection
at the Museum of American Folk Art in New York. When it leaves
Baltimore Nov. 11, it will travel to Portland, Ore.; Indianapolis;
Louisville, Ky.; Madison, Wis.; Muscatine, Iowa; New London, Conn.;
Huntsville, Ala.; Halifax, Nova Scotia; and Memphis, Tenn.
   Twenty-seven of the 28 objects can be touched. The display
includes a late 18th-century Shaker rocker from upstate New York, a
bottle-cap snake made in New Mexico in 1985 and a life-sized wooden
and plaster lumberjack that once served as a roadside sign.
   The only display that is marked ``Do Not Touch,'' is an unsigned
19th-century portrait of a rural New England family's toddler,
rendered by an itinerant painter. Rural and middle-class families
relied on these traveling painters for likenesses of their loved
ones.
   Every object in the room is at a level that can be easily
reached from a wheelchair. The accompanying booklet is in large
type and in Braille for blind people or those with limited sight.
   The audio tape for visitors describes each object, including its
colors, and gives clear instructions about how to walk from one
display to another in the room. A written version is also
available, and can be used as an aid by deaf people.
   Each display features a white beam on the gray carpeted floor so
blind people with canes will know when to stop. Because the beam is
in stark contrast to the floor, it aids those who have difficulty
seeing.
   A large, laminated black and white photo is attached to each
piece of art for close examination by those who have vision
problems.
   Here is a list of exhibits and shows at some museums and
galleries in the United States.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Matthew Modine Moves Closer to Stardom</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With two hit movies now in the nation's
theaters, Matthew Modine gets a few jumps toward the status that
has so far eluded him: stardom.
   Modine, whose quiet manner and fresh-faced looks conceal an
inner intensity, has delivered a variety of impressive performances
since his debut in John Sayle's ``Baby, It's You.'' He has ranged
from drama (``Streamers,'' ``Birdy'') to action (``Mrs. Soffel'')
to warfare (``Full Metal Jacket'') to comedy (``Married to the
Mob'').
   He hasn't yet snagged that breakthrough hit that will elevate
him to the multimillion-dollar elite, as ``Big'' did for Tom Hanks
and ``Top Gun'' for Tom Cruise.
   Modine's two new films may help. In ``Pacific Heights,'' he and
Melanie Griffith are home-buying yuppies whose dream is shattered
by their vicious tenant, Michael Keaton. In ``Memphis Belle,'' he
is the World War II B-17 pilot who leads his crew through a final,
devastating mission.
   The California-born actor was here from his New York home for
the opening festivities for ``Memphis Belle.'' He and other members
of the B-17 crew, who include Eric Stoltz, Sean Astin and Harry
Connick Jr., underwent eight days of rugged basic training in
England, ending with a Marine survival course.
   Modine hadn't experienced anything like it, ``though by the end
of `Full Metal Jacket,' I felt as if I had been through basic
training,'' he said.
   ``The thing that was really good about it was something none of
us could have anticipated. When we were on the plane, we weren't
going to see other members of the crew; we were just communicating
through headsets.
   ``Having gone through that boot camp allowed us to get to know
each other. Not just to be able to identify another person's voice,
but to really know that individual. During harsh, difficult, trying
periods, one gets to know another person quite well. It became
invaluable when we were on the plane.''
   ``Memphis Belle'' started out with a bang ($5 million in the
first weekend) and ``Pacific Heights'' scared up $19 million in 17
days despite tepid reviews.
   About ``Pacific Heights,'' he remarked: ``Was it fun? Well,
there was a lot of screaming and hollering and dumping of bugs in
one's face. But the nicest thing about it was working with Melanie
Griffith; I didn't really work with Michael - I was either yelling
at him or beating him up. ... Melanie is a hard worker and she
juggles a lot quite well: family, husband (Don Johnson), career.''
   The reason for the film's success?
   ``I see it as a metaphor for what's happening in society today.
We all live in a civilized community and have agreements with each
other. We agree that we're not ging to steal from each other or
take advantage of each other. There's always someone who comes into
this community who takes advantage of the good nature of other
people. It's unfortunate.''
   Like others of his acting generation (Tom Hanks, Demi Moore, Tom
Cruise, etc.), Modine had a traveling childhood. The reason had to
do with his father who was manager of drive-in movie theaters, a
dwindling medium.
   ``The cars were getting smaller and people weren't going to
theaters as much because of television,'' he said. ``Kids could go
to the playgrounds at the theaters, then go back to the cars and go
to sleep while the parents watched the movie. But playgrounds were
taken out because of the insurance costs.
   ``Drive-ins were always out in the middle of nowhere, among
apple and peach orchards. But then the price of real estate went
up. I'd go back to the towns I'd lived in, and I couldn't recognize
them. Where my dog had been buried was a Grand Central parking lot.
Our house and the drive-in were just erased, as though they had
never existed.''
   Modine's future life came into focus when he saw a documentary
about the musical ``Oliver!''
   ``Having come from this itinerant family, I saw these children
learning to sing and dance and it looked like fun,'' he recalled.
``I was always the new kid on the block. Here were these kids who
were orphans in the script, and they were learning the songs and
dancing. It seemed like a good family to be part of. So I asked my
father if I could take some tap dancing and singing lessons. Much
to my surprise and enjoyment, he said yes.''
   Modine, who lives in a Greenwich Village house with his wife and
two young children, agrees that a traveling childhood can be
perfect training for future actors: They study a wide range of
human nature, learn to adapt to new surroundings. But he found a
drawback.
   ``I didn't get a proper education. Teachers let you slide a bit
so you can catch up. Public schools are so crowded that teachers
can't give you that special attention to let you catch up,'' he
said.
   ``I didn't really read a book until I was working on a film
playing a high school student. I was sitting in a classroom and I
saw the Ernest Hemingway book, `The Old Man and the Sea.' It was
one of the first books I read from cover to cover. Otherwise, I was
lying and cheating my way through school.''
   Another result of his childhood: He learned to say goodbye to
friends. Film actors spend two or three months of intimate contact
with fellow workers, many of whom they never see again.
   ``I value friendships very much,'' says Modine, 30. ``One or
two, sometimes three people from each movie I work on I desperately
try to keep in touch with. I don't want to disregard those
friendships just because the picture is over. I want to continue to
share and grow with them.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Placido Domingo Hits 2,200th Performance</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHEILA NORMAN-CULP</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A week after his 2,200th performance opened the
Metropolitan Opera's fall season, Placido Domingo has no intention
of cutting back from the hectic schedule for which he is famous.
   ``I do rest a lot more than people think,'' the tenor said,
squeezing in an interview during a short break at a recording
studio. ``I continue at the right pace; I pace myself well.''
   The right pace for Domingo would kill many a lesser mortal. He
averages 90 performances a year, in addition to recording albums
(he has over 70) and serving as an artistic consultant to the Los
Angeles Opera and the 1992 Universal Exposition in Seville, Spain.
   Even as he talked, aides interrupted him with questions, while
photographers who had planned on just a few minutes more to shoot
his picture for an album cover bemoaned the loss of time.
   ``Tell him I have my hands full now,'' the singer told an
assistant who asked if he would speak the next day with ABC-TV
anchorman Peter Jennings.
   ``When you have interviews, or extra work, ahh,'' Domingo
shrugged, somewhat sheepishly. ``The singing is not so hard as all
the extra things that come along.''
   But ask him how he plays Rodolfo in ``La Boheme,'' or what it's
like making his first album with Itzhak Perlman, or about his role
as artistic consultant for Expo 92 in Seville. Then the strain of
being one of opera's most prolific stars melts away in the sheer
joy of talking about opera, music and Domingo's native Spain.
   The opening night performance was his 120th portrayal of
Rodolfo, the brash young poet. Still, the tenor says he enjoys the
role, relishing its blend of comedy and tragedy, and the chance to
don Rodolfo's bohemian mantle of youth.
   ``It's very good to have an element of comedy,'' he says, noting
that most roles for his vocal range lean toward tragedy.
   Critics praised the chemistry between Domingo and soprano
Mirella Freni, who played the frail, yearning seamstress Mimi, even
though the two had not previously performed together.
   According to Domingo, how a role is acted in ``La Boheme'' can
be as vital to the performance as how it is sung. ``The acting is
very important, how you play certain moments. The interaction has
to be very strong.''
   The Spanish star says the ending of ``La Boheme,'' where Mimi
dies apparently from consumption, is especially tricky for a tenor.
   
   ``You can really spoil the ending. So much tragedy is there,
it's almost melodramatic,'' he said. ``If you go too far or stay
too cool, perhaps the atmosphere at the ending is not the right
one.''
   The atmosphere at the recording studio, where Domingo joked as
he and Perlman posed for pictures, was certainly the right one. The
as-yet unnamed album, under the Angel/EMI label, will feature some
of the pieces made famous by the Irish tenor John McCormack.
   Songs already recorded include ``Elergie,'' by Massenent;
``Ideale,'' by Tosti; the Largo from ``Xerxes,'' by Handel; and
Barcarole, from Offenbach's ``The Tales of Hoffman.''
   Domingo says some of his finest work, however, has come from
behind the floodlights instead of in front of them.
   ``We have five years of great results. Opera is happening in Los
Angeles,'' he declared, not without pride. ``We do all kinds of
repertoire. We have created fantastic company that didn't exist
five years ago.''
   At Expo '92, one of the main cultural highlights will be the
production of every opera set in Seville - seven total, including
``Carmen,'' ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' ``The Barber of Seville''
and ``Don Giovanni.''
   ``Our plans are quite spectacular,'' he said, reeling off the
names of opera companies scheduled to perform in Seville: the Met,
Milan, Florence, Dresden, Stockholm, Vienna, maybe Los Angeles or
Paris.
   He doesn't stop there. Symphony orchestras are expected from
London, Vienna, Leningrad, Israel and Pittsburgh, among other
places.
   The Maestranza Theater, where many of the productions will be
held, is now under construction but plans to open this spring, a
year before Expo '92 opens. Domingo, a native of Madrid, says he
will perform in Seville, but waved off further questions with a
smile.
   The Spanish tenor, well aware of frailities of the human body,
guards his instrument by not talking at all on the day of a
performance. He bends the rule somewhat on recording days.
   ``Recording, you can redo, you never do things the first time,''
he said. ``In the theater no one is going to help you. You have to
do it from beginning to end.''
   But the prospect of turning 50 this January doesn't faze him in
the least.
   ``It's wonderful to arrive at 50,'' he smiled. ``I am working
with more energy than ever.''

   Age hasn't mellowed the high priest of punk,
Iggy Pop.
   Since his early days as the volatile leader of the Stooges, Pop
(born James Osterburg), has been an angry man - angry about life's
despair and angry at the state of rock music as he knows and loves
it.
   On his latest album, ``Brick by Brick,'' Pop reiterates his
anger from the viewpoint of someone who's seen it all and doesn't
like much of what he's seen.
   He blasts artists who fall victim to commercialism in ``Main
Street Eyes,'' record company executives looking for new blood at
any cost on ``My Baby Wants to Rock and Roll,'' and yuppies who
glorify the almighty dollar in ``Starry Night.''
   He's proud of his own integrity and self-respect, but knows he's
in for a fight to keep those traits intact because, as he says, 'my
head keeps trying to sell me ambition.'
   Pop realized that he had to make a stand for the kind of music
he believed in when he was dropped from Elektra Records in 1970 and
was faced with making a career move that would have threatened that
music. He said the decision only made him more determined.
   ``It's when you say no at crisis times - it strengthens your
resolve and your self-respect, and at the same time, it also makes
it harder for you to get along in the big stream of things,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   ``I have corruptions as far as there are things that are not
particularly glorious that I do to try to protect and promote the
music that I do that I think is good, but I try to keep the music
part as pure as I can.''
   Pure music, according to Pop, is ``life-affirming.''
   ``It's something that talks to your central nervous system about
the fact that there was life before, there's going to be life in
the future and that really there's something a little more glorious
here,'' he said.
   There are tender spots on ``Brick by Brick,'' despite its anger.
``Candy,'' a duet with Kate Pierson of the B-52s, lets him grieve
over a long-lost love, but allows the woman, in the form of
Pierson, to state her mind as well. And ``Home'' is Pop's attempt
to show that he is grateful for a life now rooted after years of
instablity.
   ``I'm saying that I value and need my home life and people that
I actually can trust,'' Pop said.
   ``I spent years and years totally and absolutely alone almost
all the time, and I couldn't let anybody get near me and that's how
I wrote,'' he said. ``The only people I would know was my band and
I kept them at quite a distance, too.
   ``That has begun to change, but it's never going to totally
change, maybe because partly that's my nature and partly because
that's how I've gotten used to living, but it's changed quite a bit
now.''
   Guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan from Guns n' Roses are
featured as musicians and co-writers on several tracks. Pop praised
the band for its understanding of the punk attitude.
   ``They really have the energy of a good punk band, and
lyrically, that guy (singer Axl Rose) actually does what a good
punk lyricist tries to do,'' he said. ``He describes what's bugging
him, no matter how out there it is, and he describes what's going
on around him faithfully.''
   Pop tried to achieve his own directness on ``Brick by Brick,''
both with music and with lyrics.
   ``I want to be able to say more, just basically about the
landscape,'' he said. ``I have a lot I'd like to say and I'd like
to be able to say it more succinctly.
   ``I seem to be getting more articulate. And also as I get older,
it's like, hey, I'm gonna die anyway, (so) I'm getting less afraid
to come right out and say what I think, whereas before, I would
kind of allude to it in metaphor.''
   Despite its biting criticism, ``Brick by Brick'' wasn't a
protest album.
   ``I protest a lot of stuff in it, but if I was going to protest
it, it would be more like saying change it,'' he said. `` And I
don't ever expect it to change, so I just listed it.''
   As a self-described ``fringe character,'' Pop said rock 'n' roll
is best played by someone on the outside of society.
   ``To be done convincingly, it (rock) requires a real outsider -
the kind of people (who) may not really be bad - doomed is probably
a better word,'' he said with a laugh.
   ``There's a sense of doom, there's a sense of somebody that's
outside the accepted rewards system. Half the morbid fascination of
watching a rock career is usually when is he going to get punished
for this behavior.''
   Has he made it to that point?
   ``I made it. I'm really bad, but I feel good inside,'' he said.
``I feel cleansed from the thing, which is why I do it. I feel
appropriately clean and doomed at the same time.''

   Mario Vargas Llosa has said goodbye to the rigid
world of politics to publish an erotic novel that caused him
trouble during his quest for Peru's presidency.
   Few political hopefuls would admit to writing about an
adolescent's affair with his stepmother. Vargas Llosa said he did
not write ``In Praise of the Stepmother'' (Farrar, Strauss and
Giroux, $18.95) as a provocation. It's just that there was no
reason for him to hide his literary views.
   ``It was used against me in the campaign,'' he said of the
novel, which is being released in English this month. It was
published last year in Spanish.
   ``Announcers on television would warn people, `Get your children
out of the room,' then they would read sections of the book,'' he
said.
   The book, however, did not cost him the election, Vargas Llosa
said. A Peruvian-Japanese engineer, Alberto Fujimori, defeated him
because of differences in their plans for Peru's bankrupt economy.
   John Updike called Vargas Llosa's loss a gain for literature.
Reviewing the novel in the New Yorker, Updike said ``Praise'' would
have been a startling document in ``our erotically retrenched
nation.''
   ``Not only would an American Presidential candidate not have
written it but the National Endowment for the Arts wouldn't have
given it a grant,'' Updike wrote.
   In an interview from a 38th-floor hotel room overlooking
Manhattan's Central Park, Vargas Llosa said his life and works
often got in the way of his short political career.
   ``As a writer, you are your own master. The political life is
very different - bodyguards, rigid schedules. Not having control of
your life, becoming very dependent. It was a great effort just to
get used to this...''
   Vargas Llosa said several of his earlier novels, including
``Conversation in the Cathedral,'' ``The Green House'' or ``The
Real Life of Alejandro Mayta,'' advocated a more radical political
change than his moderate political campaign offered.
   ``In politics, I think the reformist path is the best of all
possible evils,'' he said.
   ``But not so in art. I am for the excess. In art, I think it is
important to open the door, release all that is repressed in life.
It is very dangerous to do this in real life.''
   ``In Praise of the Stepmother'' tells the story of Don
Rigoberto, an art-loving insurance executive; his wicked but
cherubic son, Alfonsito; and the stepmother, Dona Lucrecia.
Chapters alternate between the destruction of the family and erotic
fantasies based on paintings by Titian, Jordaens and Fra Angelico.
   ``The erotic world is a world in which you add art to the
physical world,'' he said. ``So there are two levels in which the
love relationship develops, the realistic one and the imaginary
one.''
   Vargas Llosa wrote it in 1987 and early 1988 and then ``got rid
of it.''
   ``You write trying to create something that you don't know what
it is until it's finished. You fight your own ghosts. You find
something that opens mysterious doors in your own personality.''
   Updike called the book an ``impish and delicate yet fiercely
serious work'' about ``the dark complexity of sex.''
   Vargas Llosa's most popular novel, ``Aunt Julia and the
Scriptwriter,'' also dealt with a romantic relationship between a
younger man and an older woman. The author only smiled when asked
about the role of past experiences in his writing.
   A film version of ``Aunt Julia,'' renamed ``Tune in Tomorrow''
and starring Peter Falk, opened last month in U.S. theaters. It
will broaden the author's exposure in the United States, and Vargas
Llosa said he was pleased with the adaptation.
   ``They have changed the story, and they have moved it from Lima
to New Orleans, but the atmosphere is quite similar. I think it
will do well.''
   However, Vargas Llosa was uncertain how his new novel would fare
in the ``complex American society.''
   ``On one hand, there is something that is great in this society
- its freedom, its possiblity to change things. At the same time,
it is difficult to understand these movements to repress.
   ``What is so obvious is that it is not books or art that corrupt
men; it is men who corrupt an idea by trying to censor it.
Repression won't solve it, it will just come out in more dangerous
ways, such as violence.''
   Vargas Llosa, saying he would ``never again'' enter politics and
staying out of Peru since his electoral loss in June, says he has
salvaged something from his two-year quest for the presidency -
material for his next novel.
   ``I had this idea before going into politics - how violence,
little by little, can take over society. This is something that
fascinates and terrifies me. Violence has become the atmosphere in
which the society breeds.''
   He mentioned the increase in drugs, which has ripped apart
societal structure in Peru, Colombia and - to a lesser extent -
much of the developed world.
   In his two-month runoff campaign against Fujimori, more than 100
of his campaign workers were killed, mostly by Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas intent on disrupting the elections.
   When asked about a Rand Corp. report predicting that the Maoist
guerrillas would take over Peru within two years, Vargas Llosa
paused for a moment and leaned back on his sofa:
   ``I wouldn't prophesize, but you must recognize that the
increase in violence is terrifying.''

   Country music pioneer Hank Snow, who
performed for American soldiers in Korea and Vietnam, would be
eager to entertain U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf if he were
younger.
   The 76-year-old Snow established himself as one of country
music's ambassadors by making several overseas tours to perform for
U.S. armed forces between 1950 and the mid-1960s.
   Besides Korea and Vietnam, Snow also sang for military personnel
in Germany, France, Norway, Italy, England and Japan.
   ``If I was 20 years younger, I'd jump at the chance to go over
again,'' said Snow, celebrating his 40th anniversary on the Grand
Ole Opry country music show.
   ``I've seen what good it can do. When we entertained over there
before, the amount of good you could feel you were doing made you
want to go back. They just needed a touch of home.
   ``It's one of the things that stays in my memory. This was a
great experience, one that money couldn't buy. It was the most
important part of my life as far as entertaining is concerned.''
   While in Korea, he offered to write letters if soldiers would
give him the names and addresses of their loved ones. He expected
to get a few hundred, but 7,000 were turned in. When he returned to
the United States, a secretary was needed to send form letters to
the soldiers' relatives.
   ``Someone came up to me at the Opry not long ago and thanked me
for the letter I wrote to his mother,'' Snow recalled.
   Snow, known as ``the singing ranger'' because he prefers cowboy
attire, has been a performer for more than 40 years.
   RCA Records has just released the ``Hank Snow Collector's
Series,'' reissuing eight of his records. Bear Records of Germany
is putting out every song he ever recorded. This is a mammoth
undertaking. Snow has sold an estimated 70 million records and made
more than 100 albums.
   His ``I'm Moving On,'' which he wrote, was No. 1 on the country
music charts for almost a year in 1950. Emmylou Harris, one
generation younger, brought it back with her version six years ago.
The song, about boarding a train to leave a wayward lover, has been
recorded by about 60 other performers.
   The ``Hank Snow Collector's Series'' includes ``I'm Moving On,''
his version of the pop music classic ``Sentimental Journey'' and
``Today I Started Lovin' You Again,'' which was a hit for Kenny
Rogers.
   Snow has had more than 40 songs in the Top 10 of the country
music charts. His heyday was the '50s and '60s.
   He was born in Liverpool, Nova Scotia. He left home at age 12
and became a cabin boy on a freighter for four years. As a
teen-ager, he used $30 in earnings from a two-week stint unloading
salt from a ship to buy his first guitar.
   He moved to the United States in the '40s and began singing in
Dallas. Country music star Ernest Tubb helped him get a spot on the
Grand Ole Opry in 1950 and he's performed on the show ever since.
   ``I think it gets in your blood,'' Snow said about the Opry in
an interview in his office at his modest home in suburban
Nashville.
   ``Sometimes you say, `I'm tired of going to the Opry.' But if
you didn't go over there and laid off for three or four weeks,
you'd want to get back there again.''
   A proud and plain-spoken man, Snow has been involved in several
ontroversies during his long career.
   In 1986, he had a dispute with CBS-TV and the Opry. He refused
to appear on a TV special saluting the Opry because he felt
slighted when asked to sing only one verse of ``I'm Moving On.''
   In another tiff, he has said he lost $2 million to $3 million in
royalties because he did not have an attorney and accountant to
keep track of the amount due him from RCA Records. He ordered an
audit and feels it contributed to the fact RCA dropped him from its
recording roster in 1980 after 45 years under contract.
   Snow and Col. Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's longtime manager,
operated a talent agency in the '50s, and Snow has long claimed
that he was not compensated fairly as Presley's agent.
   Looking back on his lengthy career, Snow is uncomfortable when
called a legend or pioneer.
   ``There are legends, living legends, dead legends and all that.
I don't go for that. I appreciate it when people say I'm a pioneer,
but you have to earn that right.''

   In the Soviet Unon's most radical departure from
Communist economics in 70 years, the legislature has voted to
transform the economy into the market-oriented system advocated by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But a rift with the country's largest republic threatened to
disrupt the effort which was approved Friday.
   Gorbachev's plan to free most prices of government control, end
most government monopolies and encourage free enterprise is an
ambitious outline for ending chronic shortages of food and housing,
integrating the Soviet Union in the world market and encouraging
people to work harder and enjoy the benefits.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Michael Milken stammered and rose from his desk
after learning speculator Ivan Boesky was cooperating with the
government's insider trading investigation in late 1986, a Milken
subordinate testified.
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond salesman Terren
Peizer described on Friday a climate of fear after the Boesky deal.
   The comments came during a pre-sentencing hearing before U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood on a series of alleged crimes the
government says were committed by Milken beyond those to which he
has pleaded guilty. Prosecutors hope to convince Wood that Milken
deserves a stiff punishment.

   DETROIT (AP) - Executives of General Motors Corp. and the United
Auto Workers union have signed a new three-year labor contract
guaranteeing the wages of about 300,000 U.S. workers.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel and UAW President Owen Bieber signed
the documents Friday.
   Bieber is now expected to turn up the heat on Chrysler Corp.
when bargaining with the No. 3 automaker intensifies next week.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Midway Airlines says it will sell off its
unprofitable hub operations at the Philadelphia International
Airport and end 61 daily flights by April 30 as it faces even
greater losses due to fuel prices.
   The selloff, said Midway President Thomas Schick said, would
cost his airline about $30 million.
   David Hinson, Midway chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement that the sale was necessary to stabilize the
airline's financial condition and return it to profitability.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The consumer group Public Citizen has admitted
it made a mistake in putting the ITT Hartford Insurance group on a
list of five insurance companies it said could fail in the event of
a recession.
   ITT Hartford said it was Public Citizen, not the insurance
company, that ``flunked the test.''
   The consumer group, affiliated with Ralph Nader, on Friday
issued a statement acknowledging the error.
   Public Citizen said Monday that the Hartford, Aetna, American
International Group, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp;
Guaranty each failed four of six tests that it used to measure
vulnerability to insolvency.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate backers of a bill to regulate cable TV
prices say the compromise measure is dead for the year, after they
failed to move it to a floor vote.
   Friday's defeat marks the end of three weeks of private
negotiations between Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., to soften language in the bill to prevent cable
programmers from making exclusive contracts with cable system
operators.
   It also culminated a two-year effort to meld two dozen cable
bills into a law that would address rising concerns about shoddy
service and cable charges, which have risen 43 percent in the last
three years.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers who for more than a year have wanted

have pretty much given up the idea in the waning days of the
Congressional session.
   The House voted 247-174 Thursday to overrule President Bush's
decision in May to allow China to retain ``most favored nation''
status.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
disagreed with Bush's decision, but Mitchell said supporters lacked
the two-thirds majorities needed in both houses to override what
administration officials said would be a sure veto by Bush.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An international panel said it would include
in a list of chemicals to be reviewed in 1992 a drug that could
induce cows to give more milk.
   The drug, bovine somatotropin or BST, is still under review by
the Food and Drug Administration for possible use by U.S. dairy
farmers. Tests indicate the synthetic hormone could increase a
cow's milk production by 10 percent to 25 percent.
   The Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods met
in closed session Friday.

   BOSTON (AP) - More bad news surfaced for one of New England's
largest banks. The Bank of New England Corp. reported a loss of
$123.2 million or $1.78 a share in the third quarter, due largely
to a $100 million provision for possible credit losses.
   The company blamed its losses on the slowdown of the New England
economy, worsened by rising oil prices and Middle East
uncertainties.

   The company that brought the all-purpose
Swiss Army pocketknife to America is now offering products that do
more than open wine bottles, strip wire or gut fish.
   Forschner Group Inc., the U.S. distributor of the multiblade red
knives with silver crosses, has expanded into the sunglass and
watch business with its new subsidiary, Swiss Army Brands Ltd.
   The company is banking on consumers' familiarity with the Swiss
Army name to get these products off the ground.
   ``There is a high-quality imagery associated with the knife,''
said Forschner President James Kennedy. ``It has always been known
as a useful, utilitarian product and we were able to transfer that
to the watch's image.''
   Sales of the Swiss Army Brand watch totaled around $4 million
since its debut last fall, double the projections, said Kennedy.
   The simple watch with a large face, big numbers and black strap
was designed in the United States and manufactured in Switzerland.
It sells for $95 retail.
   The Swiss Army Brand aviator-style sunglasses were introduced in
April and sell for around $115 retail. But sales have been
disappointing thus far, totaling just $385,000 in the first nine
months of this year. Kennedy said the glasses came out too late to
be included in many retailers' summer catalogs.
   The new products are targeted at upscale, outdoorsy types who
frequent camping and hunting stores. The company does minimal
advertising and its products are sold by exclusive retailers such
as Hoffritz for Cutlery, Eddie Bauer and Hammacher Schlemmer.
   The Swiss-based Victorinox Cutlery Co., founded in 1884 by Karl
Elsener, developed the original Swiss Army knife in 1891. Its
patent on the pocketknife expired in 1908, and since then, many
imitations have surfaced.
   About half the soldiers in the Swiss Army carry Victorinox
knives. The rest are manufactured by their rival, Wenger, which
also sells Swiss Army knives in the United States through retailers
like K Mart and L. L. Bean.
   Victorinox makes 295 different models of the knife, but
Forschner sells only about 50 in the United States.
   The ``Scientist'' model features a magnifying glass, while the
``Tinker'' contains two can openers and a Phillips screwdriver. A
saw, pliers, scissors and a file are part of the ``Craftsman.''
   Forschner became a distributor for the pocketknives shortly
after World War II. The company started out 135 years ago in New
Britain selling only butcher scales. In the 1930s, it added
Victorinox butcher knives to its line.
   The butcher knives, sold almost exclusively to slaughterhouses
and restaurants, accounted for 27 percent of Forschner's business
last year. Another 23 percent came from Swiss Army knives printed
with corporate logos. The other half came from the pocketknives.
   When Kennedy came to work at the company in 1975, it decided to
stop selling butcher scales and to halt sales of the pocketknives
to its 40 wholesalers. Forschner began selling the pocketknives
directly to specialty retail stores.
   Imitation knives have plagued Forschner for years, but when
knockoffs of the watches started showing up in stores for $20-$25,
the company took immediate action against some Asian manufacturers
for violating trade laws.
   Since the knockoffs were not manufactured in Switzerland, the
companies making them were not allowed to call them Swiss-style or
Swiss-like and were prohibited from using the trademark Swiss
Cross.
   Such restrictions also have limited Forschner's growth.
   ``We have to have all our products made in Switzerland, where
the factories are small, inefficient and expensive,'' Kennedy said.
He added that the strength of the Swiss franc has added to his
purchase price.
   Nonetheless, in the past 16 years, Forschner's profits have
grown 4,000 percent. Last year, Forschner sold $33 million worth of
knives, up from less than $1 million in 1974.

   Holding the battle lines these days at Chrysler
Corp.'s headquarters is tough work.
   Executives of the financially struggling automaker are fighting
on a number of fronts, any one of which can explode in their faces.
   Profits are sinking. Talk of some sort of merger deal with Fiat
SpA won't go away. Criticism for lacking a new mid-size car
persists. In some quarters at least, Chairman Lee Iacocca's once
magnetic personality is weakening.
   But all's not dark and gloomy at the nation's No. 3 automaker.
   Chrysler has about $4 billion in cash to weather tough times.
Much of the Fiat speculation centers on joint production of a
vehicle that would cut costs for both companies. Chrysler's new
minivan has been well received in showrooms. The company's
advertisements featuring Iacocca stressing safety have coincided
with increased American consumer demand for safe cars.
   Perhaps the company's most immediate problem is the United Auto
Workers union. On the surface, the confrontation between Chrysler
and the union representing about 63,000 of its hourly and salaried
workers seems intractable.
   The UAW vows there will be no deviation for Chrysler from the
contract it has reached with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. Some UAW members are wearing buttons saying ``Pattern or
Picket.''
   Chrysler insists the pattern agreement is too expensive. The
company wants relief from what it calls spiraling health-care
costs.
   But as in most negotiations, there's room to maneuver.
   ``The issue here isn't concessions,'' Chrysler Motors Chairman
Bennett Bidwell said in a recent interview. ``The issue here is
moderation.
   ``Can we have some flexibility and move the furniture around in
a way that is both appropriate and proper for the UAW and its
membership and constructive for the company?'' he said.
   Chrysler is involved in a cost-cutting program begun in October
1989 designed to remove $2.5 billion in costs by next June. Despite
those reductions, the company is expected to report later this
month that losses during the third quarter will erase the $251
million it earned in the first six months of this year.
   The fourth quarter promises to be better, but some Wall Street
analysts are wondering whether Chrysler will have made any money by
year-end.
   Chrysler and Fiat executives have acknowledged they are
discussing a range of associations, including joint development of
the ``JJ'' small sport-utility vehicle, vehicle distribution
arrangements and a Fiat investment in Chrysler.
   Through the first nine months of this year, Fiat held 14.3
percent of the Western European new car market, second only to
Volkswagen AG's 15.1 percent. Third was Peugeot SA of France at
12.9 percent; GM and Ford European subsidiaries each held 11.7
percent, tied for fourth place.
   Chrysler held less than 1 percent of the market.
   Before Fiat would consider buying part of Chrysler, Fiat USA
Inc. spokesman Gualberto Ranieri said, the company has other more
pressing projects, including expansion into the emerging Eastern
European vehicle market.
   Fiat's chairman, Giovanni Agnelli, has said the Chrysler-Fiat
talks must reach a conclusion soon, possibly within a month.
   Chrysler spokeswoman Karen Stewart said earlier this month the
company had no reaction to Agnelli's comments. ``There's nothing
new to report,'' she said.
   Although the specific nature of any joint vehicle hasn't been
announced, it's unlikely to be a new mid-size car, seen as badly
needed by Chrysler.
   As plans stand now, Chrysler will bring out a new high-volume
sedan, codenamed ``LH,'' in late 1992 for the 1993 model year.
Company officials have said the ``LH'' is likely to look like the
Eagle Optima car Chrysler has been exhibiting at auto shows.
   If that proves true, it would point Chrysler in a new design
direction away from the officially dead, but not gone, K-cars that
helped pull the company away from bankruptcy in the early 1980s.
   No matter what cars or trucks come off drawing boards, Chrysler
still must sell them. That's where Iacocca comes in.
   Bidwell concedes Iacocca's image may have slipped a bit in
Detroit and Washington from overexposure. Chrysler research says
that's not so elsewhere.
   ``According to their research, which is repetitive, in Dubuque
(Iowa) and places like that, the image is still pretty good,''
Bidwell said.
   In Dubuque, sales manager Perry Pickel of Wilson Brothers Dodge
agreed.
   ``It's not as strong as it was,'' he said, ``but I don't think
it has lost as much as people think.''

   Shoney's Inc. is providing braille menus
in 42 Tennessee restaurants and, if there's a demand, plans to
insert the special menus in its 715 restaurants across the country.
   The concept is public service - and public relations. But if it
generates a profit, that's all right too, company executives say.
   Making the notion work is another matter.
   ``The difficulty in preparing braille menus in one place and
sending them out is you'll still have price variations. Prices in
Dothan, Ala., might be a little cheaper than in New York City,''
said Oral Miller, executive director of the 40,000-member American
Council of the Blind in Washington.
   McDonald's introduced braille menus and large-type menus 10
years ago and is updating the project.
   ``McDonald's didn't do a real good job at publicizing those
menus. As a result, many blind people didn't know they existed. In
many cases when a blind person asked for it, because the menu is
such a rare thing, many employees didn't know they had it,'' Miller
said.
   ``So, it's essential for the restaurant to keep the employees
informed.''
   Shoney's marketing director Jeff Sowell came up with the idea
after talking with a visually impaired worker about placing orders
in restaurants.
   ``He said `I know what I want or I take a sighted person with
me,''' Sowell said.
   Problems arise when a busload of blind customers shows up at the
family restaurant with only a driver or a couple other people who
can see, Sowell said.
   ``We're just doing it in the Middle Tennessee right now as a
test. Two menus at each location - two for breakfast, two for lunch
and two for dinner,'' he said.
   The company spent less than $5,000 to have the six-page menus
converted to braille, produced at the Tennessee School for the
Blind and delivered to the midstate restaurants.
   Shoney's executives will decide within three months whether to
extend the braille menus nationwide.
   ``I don't foresee us dropping it in this market because there is
a large market in Nashville for visually impaired people,'' Sowell
said.
   Such menus will make ordering easier for many blind people, but
only 40 percent of the legally blind people in the country can read
braille, Miller said.
   A volunteer network based in Austin, Texas - Sight through
Helping Hands - provides braille menus for some McDonald's, Pizza
Hut and Mr. Gatti's restaurant groups along with restaurants in the
Marriott chain.
   A group of students from Tennessee School for the Blind prepared
the Shoney's menus on computers, and Shoney's donated $1,750 to the
school for computer classes.
   ``Of course, when you hear a menu there's no way in the world
you can remember all the items and the prices. So, this is a way
for them to read and feel more comfortable,'' said Harbans Dhindsa,
the school's coordinator of special education.

<TEXT>
   Channel One, the news network for students,
already has received mixed marks for running commercials. Now
students at a high school here have staged a boycott against it
after giving the news show a failing grade.
   ``Students feel Channel One is just another kid show, a senior
high `Sesame Street,''' says Fargo North High School Principal Ed
Raymond.
   Some 600 Fargo North students took part in the two-day boycott
of Channel One last month by refusing to go to the classes showing
the newscast. The following week, dozens took their concerns to the
Fargo School Board. The matter was referred to a three-member
curriculum committee, which is to make its recommendations Tuesday.
   Channel One always has been controversial since Whittle
Communications announced its plan to provide free video equipment
to schools that agreed to air the daily television news program,
with two minutes of commercials wedged in each 10-minute program.
   Gary Belis, a spokesman for Whittle Communications, based in
Knoxville, Tenn., says Fargo North High School is an aberration.
   ``Out of 4,000 schools on line, this is the only one raising a
protest,'' he says.
   Raymond says the school, which has 850 students, needs the
satellite dish, central control panel and 36 video monitors Whittle
provides. But some students say they feel they were used as a
bargaining chip.
   Jared Eide, a senior at Fargo North, says students are eager to
learn more about current events, but Channel One presnnts the news
in 30-second sound bites.
   ``There are only 2{ minutes of hard news,'' says Eide. ``You get
more out of reading the newspaper headlines.''
   Student body president Erika Hovland voted in favor of Channel
One last spring after viewing a promotional program. But she said
it's been a disappointment and she now wants to switch channels.
   Educational programming is also available from the Public
Broadcasting Service, Cable News Network and other channels.
   Eide and Hovland say students are willing to raise the $30,000
needed to replace the equipment if they are allowed a choice of
programs.
   A survey last spring by the Fargo Education Association showed
347 teachers opposed Channel One and 109 favored it. Most, like
Joan Humphrey, rejected its commercialism.
   ``I just think it's unethical to close the classroom door when
commercials are being aired,'' she says.
   Most Channel One commercials get titters from Humphrey's senior
English students. An ad for acne medication gets a collective
groan.
   ``I think everyone would agree that programming without
commercials is better than one with commercials,'' Belis says.
``The problem is, how do you pay for it?''
   Eleven North Dakota high schools in Fargo, Bismarck and
Jamestown now tuning into Channel One. Whittle recently approached
the Dickinson School District about becoming the 12th.

   Oil prices should drop after the Persian Gulf
crisis ends, but probably will still wind up higher than they were
before the invasion of Kuwait, says a survey of independent oil
executives.
   The survey, released Sunday, also indicates independent
producers are not changing their plans based on current oil prices.
   Two-thirds of the 203 executives responding to The Roper
Organization survey said they were ``somewhat optimistic'' about
the long-term future of the petroleum industry, while another 20
percent said they were ``very optimistic.''
   Seventy-three percent of the executives said the Gulf crisis
will result in a permanent increase in the price consumers pay for
oil; 94 percent said the crisis will spur interest in non-oil
energy sources; and 97 percent said the demand for domestically
abundant natural gas will increase because of the higher oil
prices.
   While 80 percent said the crisis would increase North American
energy insecurity, 66 percent of the executives said the conflict
will not result in decreased use of oil from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel.
   Nevertheless, the executives said the crisis hasn't changed
their plans:
   -71 percent said they have not increased production since Aug.
2, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and 73 percent said they had not
increased capital spending.
   -80 percent said they have not changed strategic planning since
the invasion.
   ``The survey shows that though people are optimistic, they
haven't changed their strategy because of what's happened in the
Middle East,'' said Grant Porter, a managing director of Lehman
Brothers, which sponsored the survey along with the Independent
Petroleum Association of America.
   ``What the industry needs right now is stability,'' Porter said.
``They are not making planning decisions based on $40 a barrel oil.
They may enjoy the cash flow, but they're not making plans.''
   Asked where they thought the price of oil would stabilize once
the crisis ends, 38 percent said it would settle at $25 a barrel,
and 30 percent said it would return to between $21 and $24 a
barrel. A barrel holds 42 gallons of oil
   On Friday, the near-term contract for light sweet crude, the
benchmark U.S. grade, fell to $33.79 a barrel, down $3.01 from
Thursday and $5.81 from a week ago.
   The price, which hit a record $41 a barrel earlier this month,
was less than $20 in July, the month before the invasion.
   Porter said some people may be surprised at results showing that
of the 92 executives who said their companies are reviewing new
exploration areas as a result of the crisis, 89 of them, or 97
percent, were looking at the 48 contiguous states.
   In other findings, only 4 percent said they were considering
expanding into alternative energy forms.
   The survey was conducted by telephone in September and has a
margin of error of plus or minus 7 percent.
   The Independent Petroleum Association of America, meeting this
week in Dallas, represents 10,000 independent crude and natural gas
explorers and producers. Independents drill about 85 percent of all
wells in the United States and produce about 31 percent of the
domestic oil and 60 percent of natural gas production.

   Veterans of American Bankers Association
conventions say the lavish social events have largely disappeared
this year as the banking industry meets amid soft earnings in a
weakening economy.
   ``It's more, let's take care of business,'' said one longtime
conventioneer.
   The attendance of about 4,500 is down 18 percent from last year
as some banks decided to forego the meeting to cut expenses.
   There also are fewer exhibitors. Those who did come apparently
are displaying a degree of frugality. At a makeshift marketplace on
the convention floor, vendors selling modestly-priced items were
doing far better than those with big-ticket goods.
   ``If they keep buying, we'll have to make more,'' said Darlene
George of Newport Richy, Fla., who was selling linen and lace
figurines.
   But Art LaBellman, an Orlando fur coat dealer, said Sunday he'd
yet to make a sale. ``We had a lot of interest yesterday, but no
sales,'' LaBellman said. ``But we're selling an expensive luxury
item. Someone's not going to spend $500, $1,000, $2,000 very
quickly.''
   The banking industry has been racked by a spate of losses or
reduced earnings caused in part by a decline in the economy and
fallout from bad loans.
   Those problems are much on the minds of those attending the
five-day ABA meeting, which continues through Wednesday.
   But the word here, repeated dozens of times over the first two
days of the meeting, is that banking is nowhere near the type of
crisis that engulfed the nation's savings and loan industry.
   ``I think banks are concerned. They're trying to find every
avenue they can to cut back,'' said William S. Bushnell of
Danielson Associates Inc., a consultant from Rockville, Md.
   ``But there are banks that are doing very well, thank you,''
said Bushnell, formerly a bank chairman in New Hampshire. ``Like
everything else in this world, you hear about who's not doing
well.''
   Andrew C. Hove Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., told a session on Sunday that bankers must
emphasize to their customers that banking is much healthier than
the S&amp;L industry.
   Hove said that between 1985 and 1987, 600 of the nation's 2,400
thrifts had less than zero capitalization and those S&amp;L's were
holding $300 billion in assets. By comparison, he said, last year
81 of the nation's 13,000 banks had negative capitalization and
those banks had only $11 billion in total assets, he said.
   ``Those are positive numbers,'' Hove said.
   Others are emphasizing that the banks are better capitalized and
better regulated than the thrifts.
   Nevertheless, the slumping economy makes many banks vulnerable,
said analyst Alex Sheshunoff of Austin, Texas.
   ``If we have a recession, which it looks like we're going to
have, it will have an even greater impact because the country is so
over-leveraged,'' said Sheshunoff, president of Sheshunoff &amp; Co.
``There's no room to simply go ahead and prime the pump by telling
banks to lend some more money.''
   Government regulation also is commanding the attention of the
bankers, with several seminars devoted to recent and expected
changes in the system.
   Edward L. Yingling, executive director of the ABA's government
relations group, said he expects at least a half dozen reform
proposals to surface next year in Congress.
   Yingling said Sunday he anticipates major deposit insurance
reform with new requirements for the amount of capital maintained
by banks, restructuring of e products and services rules, changes
in the S&amp;L bailout legislation and a new interstate banking bill.
   ``Almost all the rules you are operating under could be changed
in the next Congress,'' he said. ``Can something like this pass? No
one knows the answer to it. There's going to be a real donnybrook
in terms of the lobbying involved.''

   It's a late entry, but Boeing Co.'s new 777
jetliner should prove to be a strong seller and one of the
aerospace giant's key products over the next decade, industry
analysts say.
   ``In my way of thinking, it's the forerunner of the planes of
the 21st century,'' says Paul Nisbet, who follows Boeing for
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York. ``I think we're in for an
era of the `big twins' if you will.''
   The two-engine 777, second in size to Boeing's four-engine
747-400, is the first all-new design by the Seattle planemaker in
12 years. Boeing also says the aircraft may be the basis of a new
family of jets, and represents a change in philosophy in the way it
develops planes.
   Last Monday, United Airlines became the first to order the jets,
buying 34 777s and taking options on another 34. It also placed 30
orders and took 30 options on 747-400s. If it buys all 128 planes,
the deal would be worth more than $22 billion, the largest
commercial jet purchase ever.
   More orders may be on the way. All Nippon Airways says it is
considering the 777 for a possible 30-plane purchase by the end of
the year.
   Analyst Howard Rubel of Cyrus J. Lawrence in New York said he
expects Boeing to receive about 100 777 orders in the near future.
Nisbet said he thinks two or three orders may be placed by the end
of the year and could help push the total value of Boeing's 1990
orders to more than $50 billion, a sixth consecutive record year.
   Still, that would be only a beachhead in one of the most
fiercely competitive markets in commercial aviation: high capacity,
medium- to long-range jets.
   Boeing thinks the market will be huge. Between now and 2005, it
estimates, 10,000 commercial jets will be delivered with a total
value of $626 billion in 1990 dollars. A quarter of those planes
will be large-capacity aircraft, Boeing says, but will account for
43 percent of the dollar value - about $268 billion.
   The first 777 is to fly in 1994, with deliveries to customers
the next year. That gives Boeing's two competitors, McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie, a long head start.
   McDonnell Douglas plans the first deliveries of its three-engine
MD-11 by year's end, spokesman Donald Hanson says. It has 173 firm
orders from 32 customers for the plane, a reworked successor to the
DC-10.
   Airbus has firm orders for 88 of its four-engine A340 and 129 of
the twin-engine A330. The A340 enters service in 1992 and the A330
the year after, spokeswoman Sandy Smith said.
   The two models are basically the same design, except for the
number of engines. The A340-200 can carry 262 passengers in two
classes 8,600 miles, the stretched A340-300 can carry 295 people
7,700 miles, and the A330 can take 335 passengers 5,400 miles.
   The MD-11 carries 293 passengers up to 8,000 miles, while the
777 will haul 360-390 passengers up to 4,800 miles. Chris
Longridge, executive vice president for sales for Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group, says it is studying a 300-320 passenger version of
the 777 with a range of 7,200 miles.
   All three manufacturers say they have the best planes. All make
advances in aerodynamics, avionics and cabin design and will be far
more fuel-efficient and quieter than the DC-10s and Lockheed
L-1011s they aim to replace.
   But Boeing might have an edge by getting into the game late,
says analyst Bill Whitlow of Gallagher Capital Corp. in Seattle.
   With no deliveries until 1995, Boeing should be able to produce
a more modern and economical plane, Whitlow says.
   Nisbet agreed. ``I think these big twins are going to be
considerably more efficient and therefore more attractive,'' he
said. ``I think the 777 is going to be the leader because of its
size and expandability and it's somewhat later technology.''
   The 777 will feature folding wingtips to fit in at more airport
gates, extensive use of lightweight composite materials and a
high-efficiency wing to let it take off with heavier loads under
more adverse conditions.
   Longridge told a news conference last week he wasn't too
concerned the plane will debut after his competitors'.
   The long lead time also dissipates short-term concerns about
high fuel costs, Longridge said. Airlines have been hurt by fuel
prices, Nisbet said, but if anything, it should spur them to buy
more efficient planes.

<HEAD>TBS Buys Rights To Televise 1,000 MGM-UA Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. has agreed to buy
the rights to nearly 1,000 MGM-UA movies from Pathe Communications
Inc. if Pathe can complete its attempt to buy the MGM-UA
Communications Co.
   The l0-year license agreements cover classic films in the United
Artists library as well as MGM films produced in 1985-1988 and some
in 1989. In 1986, TBS paid $1.5 billion to buy the MGM library of
films prior to May 1985.
   The package includes the first 16 James Bond movies and the
``Rocky'' through ``Rocky IV'' series.
   TBS and Pathe did not release the value of the agreements
announced Sunday. TBS spokeswoman Kitsie Riggall said the value of
the package was greater than a similar deal TBS made with Columbia
Pictures last year for $22 million, but not nearly as expensive as
the 1986 purchase of the MGM catalogue.
   The deal hinges on Pathe completing its purchase of MGM-UA.
   So far, Pathe has paid $353 million toward the purchase price of
about 1.3 billion. Questions still surround how Pathe's principal,
Giancarlo Parretti, will finance the remaining $900 million.
   The license agreements will allow TBS to show the films
exclusively for 10 years on its cable television channels, WTBS
Superstation and Turner Network Television.
   In addition to the James Bond and Rocky movies, the agreements
cover movies such as ``Rainman,'' ``A Fish Called Wanda,''
``Wargames'' and ``Yentl,'' as well as classics like ``West Side
Story,'' ``The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,'' ``Annie Hall,''
``Fiddler on the Roof,'' and ``Some Like It Hot.''
   The agreements do not include any future MGM-UA productions.

   Congressional negotiators reached a tentative
agreement today on a wide-ranging clean air bill that will require
factories, automakers and utilities to cut pollution dramatically
over the next decade.
   The legislation, which toughens federal air pollution laws for
the first time in 13 years, was expected to be formally approved by
a House-Senate conference, possibly later today, and then go back
to the two chambers for endorsement.
   The bill's controls, aimed at cutting urban smog and ridding the
air of millions of pounds of toxic chemicals, are expected to touch
on almost every sector of industry and cost the economy between $22
billion and $25 billion when all its provisions go into effect.
   Under the legislation, pollution from automobiles would be cut
30 percent to 60 percent, oil companies would be required to
provide cleaner gasoline, industries would reduce the amount of
toxic chemicals released into the air and about 100 cities would be
ordered to meet federal air quality standards.
   The compromise bill retains a five-year, $250 million aid
program for workers who lose their jobs because of tougher
pollution controls. The White House had objected to financial
assistance and had threatened to veto the bill if it were included.
   But the administration appeared to soften its opposition to the
provision after language was included to keep the program from
becoming too costly.
   White House aides when departing from the talks did not repeat
their veto threat and congressional sources said they doubt
President Bush would scuttle the long-sought clean air legislation
on that job-loss assistance issue.
   Congress began considering the clean air measure more than a
year ago.
   Agreement on the last sections of the massive bill, which covers
nearly 700 pages, came as House and Senate negotiators worked
through most of night Sunday and much of the early morning today.
Congressional leaders had wanted a bill by the end of the weekend
to give it enough time to clear Congress before adjournment Friday.
   Negotiators reached agreement early Sunday on steep pollution
cuts from electric power plants to reduce acid rain. Coal-burning
power plants in 21 states will be directed to cut their sulfur
dioxide releases almost in half, reducing annual emissions by about
10 million tons by the year 2001.
   The acid rain provision, which will hit utilities and consumers
of electricity in the industrial Midwest the hardest, was the last
major section of the bill to be resolved. Agreements had been
reached previously that cut smog-causing emissions from automobiles
and toxic chemical releases from factories and businesses.
   ``We're getting real protection. It meets the acid test on acid
rain,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., a leading proponent of
acid rain curbs.
   The House-Senate conferees struggled since mid-July to resolve
differences in separate bills approved earlier by the House and
Senate.
   For weeks there was only modest progress, but the pace quickened
in recent weeks with tentative agreements on key sections of the
massive and technically complex legislation. Among the major
provisions:
   - Utilities must reduce their annual sulfur dioxide emissions by
10 million tons, or nearly in half, by installing ``scrubbers'' or
switching to lw-sulfur coal. They also must cut nitrogen oxides,
which also contribute to acid rain.
   - About 100 cities now considered to have unhealthy air must
meet federal air quality standards within five to 15 years,
depending on the severity of the problem, by reduce smog-causing
emissions. Los Angeles is given 20 years.
   - Industry must install new pollution control equipment to cut
the release of toxic chemicals into the air by 90 percent over the
next decade. Only the steel industry's coke ovens would be given
more time, until 2020. Even stronger pollution control measures
could be required if the Environmental Protection Agency concludes
that residents near a plant are not ensured ``an amble margin of
safety'' from the risk of cancer.
   - Pollution from automobiles must be cut 30 to 60 percent
through additional controls on tailpipe emissions and the phase-in
of alternative fuel vehicles in fleets. A California pilot program
also would require 300,000 personal cars powered by alternative
fuels by 1999. It could be copied by other states.
   - Oil companies must provide cleaner gasoline blends in cities
with the worst smog problems. The requirement is aimed at pushing
the sale of ``reformulated'' gasoline or blends that include
additives such as ethanol.
   The measures affecting factories, thousands of small businesses,
automobiles and electric rates are acknowledged to be expensive.
But environmentalists argue much of the cost will be offset by
savings in health care because of the cleaner air.
   The controls on acid rain are expected to hit hardest in the
industrial Midwest where electric utilities have the dirtiest
plants because of their heavy reliance on high-sulfur coal.
   In final bargaining, Midwest lawmakers gained some additional
credits that will ease the cost of installing new pollution
devices, especially over the first five years. Negotiators,
however, rejected efforts by the utility industry to roll back the
sulfur dioxide reductions substantially, according to congressional
sources.
   Early today, the House and Senate negotiators also agreed to
impose for the first time air pollution restrictions on offshore
oil rigs, an issue pressed by California lawmakers. Rigs off the
Gulf of Mexico, however, are exempt.
   Meanwhile, a requirement to regulate visibility in federal parks
was taken out of the bill. Several western senators had threatened
to block the legislation on the Senate floor if it contained the
visibility provision. The compromise calls for park visibility to
be studied.

   Grain and soybean futures prices rose in early
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as a rally led by the soybean
complex overcame selling interest linke to the advancing harvest.
   Soybeans rallied modestly amid indications the Soviet Union
bought up to 50,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal last week.
There was no confirmation of a sale.
   Harvest pressure limited the gains, analysts said.
   ``We had real good harvest weather over the weekend and more of
the same is expected this week,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an
assistant vice president in the grain-trading division of Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   A weekly government report scheduled for release after today's
close probably will show the harvest about 50 percent complete and
still lagging behind the normal pace, he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.64} a bushel; corn
was 1\ cents to 2{ cents higher with December at $2.30} a bushel;
oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with December at $1.24{ a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 7 cents higher with November at

   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange ahead of two Agriculture Department
reports due out after the close: the quarterly cattle-on-feed
report and the monthly USDA cold-storage report, which will provide
an update on frozen pork belly stocks.
   Live cattle futures were .30 cent to .37 cent lower with
December at 76.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .25
cent lower with October at 86.82 cents a pound; hog futures were
.52 cent to .70 cent lower with December at 53.45 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.55 cents to 1.77 cents lower with
February at 65.40 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

   Egypt cut its oil export prices by $6 a
barrel on Monday, reflecting a possible easing in the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   It was Egypt's largest drop since the crisis began with Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The reduction was the second in two days and brought Egypt's
prices $12 a barrel below levels a week ago. Prices last month
reached close to $40 a barrel.
   A senior oil ministry official said the drop reflects the
increasing possibility of a peaceful end to Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait.
   He also said prices were driven down by indications that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is ready to release some foreign hostages
held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The new prices are $26.30 a barrel for the top-quality Khalig
el-Zeit and Ras el-Bihar; $26 a barrel for the benchmark Gulf of
Suez; $25.15 a barrel for Belayim; $24 a barrel for Ras Badran; and
$23.70 a barrel for Ras Ghareb.
   Egypt is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries but generally sets its prices according to OPEC policies
and world market conditions.

<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
repeating a call he has made the last two years, told bankers at
their annual convention today they must increase their capital base
if the industry is to thrive.
   Greenspan declined to use the forum of the American Bankers
Association convention to deliver any major policy statement. He
left the Orange County Convention Center immediately after his
speech and refused to answer reporters' questions.
   He said capital was a key to survival in the high-tech age.
   ``During the past year, as events have unfolded around the
world, we have been continually reminded that capital is critical
to the stability and competitiveness of the banking industry,''
Greenspan said in an address that primarily focused on the history
of check-clearing technology.
   Greenspan's call for more capital repeated a theme he has
brought to the past two ABA conventions and echoed concerns on the
matter that have been expressed here during the first three days of
the five-day gathering.
   Greenspan said changing technology has broad implications for
the banking business. He said developments will eventually give
banks more competition.
   ``The creation and delivery of financial services appear to
depend to a greater and greater extent on technology that will not
be the exclusive preserve of any single firm or industry,''
Greenspan told the bankers. He said if competing businesses have
equal footing in technology, a strong capital base could be the
factor that ensures survival.
   ``Business may well flow to firms that can combine these
services with efficient and low cost access to credit and credit
markets,'' Greenspan said. ``This in turn will require a strong
capital base.''

<HEAD>Carbide Earnings Drop 35 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANBURY, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. announced today
third-quarter earnings fell 35 percent due to rising energy prices
and a soft market for chemicals.
   The company said it earned $91 million, or 63 cents a share, on
sales of $2.2 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30. That
compared with earnings of $139 million, or 98 cents per share, on
sales of $2.1 billion for the same 1989 period.
   The earnings loss was partly blamed on rising prices of energy
used to produce chemicals, said Robert D. Kennedy, chairman of
Union Carbide. The cost of crude oil and other fossil fuels has
risen sharply since the Persian Gulf crisis began in August.
   Union Carbide primarily uses liquid natural gas to produce its
chemicals, spokesman Thomas F. Sprick said, although some of its
plants are equipped to use oil.
   Kennedy said the price for raw materials and general economic
weakness ``will result in further pressures on margins and the need
for continuing controls on capital spending and costs.''
   He said third-quarter earnings included a non-recurring gain of
14 cents per share from the sale of the polysilicon business of
Union Carbide's Chemicals and Plastics Company Inc. to Komatsu
Electronic Metals C., Ltd. The gain was partly offset by
non-recurring charges totaling 7 cents per share associated with
several cost-reduction programs.
   In addition, costs associated with a power outage at Union
Carbide's Taft, La., site were estimated at 4 cents per share.
   For the first nine months of 1990, earnings dropped 43 percent.
   For that period, earnings totaled $301 million, or $2.10 cents a
share, on sales of $6.5 billion. That compared with earnings of
$526 million, or $3.74 a share, on sales of $6.6 billion for the
same 1989 period.

   Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma led an increase of

the United States, a widely-watched drilling industry index said
Monday.
   The toolmaker Baker Hughes Inc. reported the latest count

   Baker Hughes has kept track of the rig count since 1940. The
count represents the number of rigs actively exploring for oil, not
those producing oil.
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   In the most recent total, Texas gained 17 rigs while Oklahoma
and New Mexico each increased by nine.
   North Dakota showed the biggest decline of six.

   American Exploration Co. on Monday announced it
was acquiring another Houston-based oil company, Conquest
Exploration Co., in a deal estimated at $160 million.
   Under terms of the agreement, American Exploration, an
independent oil and gas company, will pay $1.90 per share for about
12 percent of Conquest's common stock and exchange 0.44 shares of
American Exploration common stock for each remaining share of
Conquest stock. Conquest has more than 44.4 million shares
outstanding.
   In addition, American Exploration will buy 5 million shares of
Conquest voting preferred stock and assume Conquest's debt of about
$55 million.
   The deal is subject to the approval of shareholders of both
companies and regulatory agencies.
   ``The acquisition of Conquest will significantly increase our
cash flow over the next few years and balance the very long life
reserves added by our acquisition of Hershey Oil Corp. earlier this
year,'' said Mark Andrews, chairman of American Exploration.
   At the end of 1989, Conquest had 6.4 million barrels of crude
oil and 112 billion cubic feet of gas. Conquest also had 222,300
undeveloped acres in North America.
   American Exploration's reserves at the end of last year included
9.9 million barrels of crude oil and 184 billion cubic feet of
natural gas, plus 84,700 undeveloped acres in North America.

   Congressional and White House negotiators
resumed their search for compromise over new taxes on the rich and
cuts in Medicare benefits today, hoping to end their budget
stalemate by week's end.
   A weekend of dickering at the Capitol left bargainers ready to
boost gasoline taxes by at least a nickel a gallon. Negotiators
also seemed closer together on proposals for Medicare cuts and
taxing the wealthy.
   The meetings also featured a well-timed walkout by an unusually
talkative White House Chief of Staff John Sununu. But this morning,
administration budget director Richard Darman returned to the
deficit-reduction talks on Capitol Hill.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
today that Sununu and Darman left Sunday's session to return to the
White House to brief the president upon his return from a weekend
at Camp David.
   He said Sununu's hasty departure did not signify White House
pessimism or a new impasse.
   Fitzwater insisted that the White House aides were no longer
part of the direct negotiations, but were only there ``as
advisers'' so conferees will know what's acceptable to the White
House. ``This is a matter between the House and Senate
negotiators,'' he said.
   ``The M&amp;M problem still remains,'' House Budget Committee
Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said today, referring to
disagreements over taxing millionaires and cutting Medicare.
   ``It's a very difficult negotiation,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee,
said as talks among congressional leaders ended late Sunday. ``Our
problem is trying to put something together that passes both
houses.''
   Lawmakers planned to resume their search today for a compromise
package that would also satisfy President Bush and allow Congress
to go home for the year by week's end.
   Narrowing one important dispute, Democrats agreed to accept a
nickel increase in the 9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax, two cents less
than Republicans wanted. The Senate last week approved a nine-cent
boost, but the House insisted on no change.
   Divisions remained over how much new taxes the rich should pay.
But the two sides seemed to be nearing an understanding - amazing
progress considering Bush's opposition to any tax increases just a
few months ago.
   Both sides were willing to boost the marginal rate on the
wealthiest Americans - families with incomes above $180,000 a year
- to 31 percent, up from the current 28 percent. And each party was
willing to limit the deductions that people earning more than
$100,000 can claim.
   But a big gap existed over a Democratic demand to levy an
additional 7.5 percent surtax on those with incomes above $1
million. Republicans said they would not accept the plan, and
instead offered a proposal - rejected by Democrats - to reduce
deductions on incomes above $1 million by 8 percent.
   In addition, Republicans wanted to lower from 33 percent to 31
percent the tax rate on families with incomes between $80,000 to
$180,000. Democrats opposed the idea.
   Negotiators also moved closer to each other on Medicare.
Democrats would restrain the growth of the program by about $44
billion over the next five years. Republicans want the cuts to be
$3 billion deeper.
   About one-fourth of the reductions would be borne directly by
the 33 million handicapped and elderly people who use the program.
Rostenkowski said the two sides were less than $2 billion apart on
the precise cut to be aimed at beneficiaries.
   Democrats also want to boost the $51,300 wage cap from which
Medicare taxes are deducted to $125,000. Republicans would increase
the cap to $98,000. The 1.45 percent Medicare tax is part of the
Social Security deduction.
   The final plan also is certain to include higher taxes on
cigarettes, alcohol, luxury items such as furs, and airline tickets
- elements that were in separate bills the House and Senate passed
last week.
   Also destined for the final bill were cuts in crop payments to
farmers, new fees for federal environmental tests and Coast Guard
services, and stingier benefits for retired civil servants and
veterans.
   Sunday afternoon, speaking to reporters just in time to make the
evening's network news programs, the usually gruff Sununu
complained that Democrats were dawdling rather than responding to
the administration's offer to raise taxes on the nation's
highest-income people.
   ``We're not going to negotiate with Democrats who can't come to
an agreement among themselves,'' he said as he left the Capitol
with White House budget chief Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady. ``This was a great offer.''
   Top Republican lawmakers agreed, with Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., saying, ``These important negotiations have reached
an impasse.''
   But shortly after the gloomy GOP assessments, congressional
leaders from both parties resumed bargaining in Dole's office.
   The deficit-reduction bill combined with other savings - mainly

lower the deficit by $40 billion for the 1991 fiscal year that

   Kansas City Power and Light Co. on Monday
extended its $875 million tender offer for Kansas Gas and Electric
Co. stock until Nov. 30, keeping alive the first hostile takeover
effort involving two major U.S. utilities.
   Kansas City Power and Light is offering $27 a share for the
stock.
   The company said that as of the expiration of the previous
tender period on Friday, 47 percent of Kansas Gas and Electric's
common stock had been tendered. That is an increase from the 43.7
percent pledged when the previous tender period expired Sept. 14.
   Turner White, Kansas City Power and Light spokesman, said last
week he expected the number of shares tendered to decrease this
latest period because state and federal regulatory agencies have
set 1991 hearings on the takeover, meaning there is no rush to make
tender decisions.
   White has said the large percentage of shares tendered is a
message from Kansas Gas and Electric stockholders urging the
utility to drop its refusal to negotiate with Kansas City Power and
Light.
   Kansas Gas and Electric's position remain unchanged. ``We're not
really sure what the numbers mean,'' said Lyle Koerper, Kansas Gas
spokesman.
   He said Kansas Gas and Electric still contends the offer is
inadequate and illegal. He said the utility is negotiating with a
third party and exploring all its options, including remaining
independent.

   The U.S. dollar rose today against major foreign
currencies in light trading in Europe. Gold prices were lower.
   Dealers said that despite the dollar's rise, the U.S. currency
still appears weak on fundamental economic factors.
   Dealers said they expected the dollar to trade within a narrow
range before Wednesday's release of U.S. durable goods orders for
September, a report that could provide more evidence about the
state of the U.S. economy.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 126.25 Japanese yen from
125.25 yen at Friday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 126.00
yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at midday at 126.25 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9495 from $1.9590 late
Friday. At midday in New York, the pound was quoted at $1.9460.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday. included: 1.5135 German marks, up from 1.5040; 1.2800 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2700; 5.0662 French francs, up from 5.0380;
1.7060 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6940; 1,134.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,127.00, and 1.1725 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675.
   Selected dollar rates at midday in New York included: 1.5195
German marks, 1.2868 Swiss francs, 1,140.20 Italian lire and
1.17305 Canadian dollars.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $367.75 a troy ounce from
$372.75 late Friday. In Zurich, gold was bid at $369.00 an ounce,
down from $372.50 late Friday. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell
$4.22 an ounce to $371.36.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of $4.21 a troy
ounce, down from $4.28 late Friday.

<HEAD>3M Reports 9.4 Percent Earnings Gain for Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.
said Monday its earnings rose 9.4 percent in the third quarter on
continued growth in overseas sales.
   Net income for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $336 million,
or $1.52 a share, compared with $307 million, or $1.37 a share, in
the same quarter last year.
   Sales for the quarter rose 11.6 percent to $3.34 billion from
$2.99 billion.
   Allen F. Jacobson, chairman and chief executive officer, said 48
percent of third-quarter sales came from overseas, where the
company booked a 13 percent increase in the number of product units
it sold. The company did not attach a dollar figure to the unit
increase.
   ``Our international volume growth remains good, but probably
won't match the third quarter's 13 percent gain,'' Jacobson said in
a forecast of the fourth quarter. He said 3M expects annual sales
and profits to exceed 1989 levels, but he said fourth-quarter
results will be influenced by the sluggish U.S. economy.
   ``Our U.S. business began to feel the effects of the slowing
U.S. economy in September,'' Jacobson said.
   The company said third quarter 1990 results also benefited from
weakening of the U.S. dollar, which makes American products cheaper
overseas, and a lower effective tax rate.
   For the first nine months, 3M's net income increased 6.4 percent
to $1.01 billion, or $4.57 a share, up from $952 million, or $4.29
a share, in the same period last year.
   Sales rose 7.8 percent to $9.74 billion from $9.04 billion.

   Retail gasoline prices rose 2{ cents per
gallon on average during the past two weeks to another record high,
a survey showed.
   The average pump price of gas for all grades, including taxes,
was $1.4709 a gallon on Oct. 19, up 2.89 cents from the old high
mark of $1.4420 at the previous sampling on Oct. 5, according to
the biweekly Lundberg Survey.
   The increase was about half the 5.8 cent rise per gallon from
Sept. 21 to Oct. 5.
   In the latest survey, average retail prices were $1.3267 a
gallon for self-serve regular, $1.3637 for regular unleaded and
$1.5264 for premium unleaded, the Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gas
stations indicated.
   Full-serve prices were $1.53.60 a gallon for regular, $1.5771
for regular unleaded and $1.7141 for premium unleaded.
   Motorists aren't the only ones being pinched, analyst Trilby
Lundberg said. Retailers are feeling the squeeze as tee high prices
and the end of the summer peak driving season reduce demand, she
said.
   Retailers haven't been able to pass on all of the wholesale
price increases to consumers because ``they are fighting for
sales,'' Ms. Lundberg said.
   The dealers' margin, the difference between what they pay for
gas and the price at which they sell it, stands at about 11 cents a
gallon, down 2 cents a gallon from before the Middle East crisis,
Ms. Lundberg said. The lost profit can amount to thousands of
dollars.

<TEXT>
   Two House Agriculture Committee subcommittee
chairmen said Monday they oppose a Chicago Board of Trade plan to
double the number of grain and soybean futures contracts available
to speculators.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said such changes should not be made
until the effects of the 1990 farm bill are known.
   The bill, which establishes new planting options as part of
government budget cuts, will dramatically change the commodities
market, said Glickman, chairman of the wheat, soybeans and feed
grains subcommittee.
   He and Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., whose subcommittee oversees
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, have asked the commission
to withhold approval of the Chicago Board of Trade plan until next
year.
   The farm bill has been approved by a House-Senate conference
committee, but awaits final votes in both chambers and the
president's signature.
   Congress is expected to recess at the end of this month.
Glickman and English said: ``At the very least we do not believe
the commission should take final action on this proposal while
Congress is in recess.''
   In a letter to commission chairwoman Wendy Gramm, the
congressmen said the Chicago Board of Trade plan appears to be
response to pressure from big commodity trading fund managers.
   The funds ``have little interest in the price discovery or
legitimate hedging functions of these markets and view them simply
as another speculative venture to market to their customers,'' the
congressmen's letter said.
   ``We do not believe the commission should approve the proposal
until its proponents can verify with certainty that it will enhance
the performance of these markets and allay fears that it will
simply subject grain producers, marketers, and users to
unnecessary, damaging price fluctuations,'' the letter said.
   Critics fear the change adopted by the Chicago Board of Trade
directors would make the commodities market even more volatile than
it is currently. They say the increased price uncertainty could be
costly to farmers and others who deal on the exchange to hedge
inventories and setting prices of produce.

<HEAD>Reports More Than Eight-fold Increase in Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pittston Co. said Monday its
third-quarter earnings were more than eight times higher than a
year earlier, when union miners were on strike against its coal
subsidiary.
   Pittston reported earnings of $26.4 million, or 71 cents per
share, in the period sending Sept. 30, compared with earnings of
$3.1 million, or 8 cents per share, in the third quarter of 1989,
the company said.
   For the January-September period, Pittston earned $35.6 million,
or 96 cents per share, compared with net income of $22.6 million,
or 60 cents per share, for the same period of 1989, Pittston said.
   Third-quarter revenues totaled $483.78 million, up 22 percent
from $395.32 million in the 1989 third quarter. For the nine
months, revelues totaled $1.36 billion vs. $1.23 billion, up 10.6
percent.
   Pittston's coal groups earned $14.4 million in the third
quarter, compared with a loss of $9.8 million in the third quarter
of a year earlier and net income of $13.3 million in the second
quarter. Its coal subsidiaries are Pittston Coal Group Inc. and
Pyxis Coal Group.
   For the first nine months of 1990, the coal groups earned $27.4
million compared with a loss of $1.7 million in the same period of
1989, Pittston said.
   About 1,700 United Mine Workers members in West Virginia,
Virginia and Kentucky struck Pittston Coal Group Inc. for 10
months, ending in February. The strike also led to a six-week
wildcat strike by up to 46,000 miners in other states.
   Third-quarter coal earnings were hurt by about $1.8 million from
a short-term price reduction under the provisions of a long-term
utility contract, said Paul W. Douglas, Pittston's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Pittston's three other subsidiaries - Burlington Air Express,
Brink's and Brink's Home Security - also showed gains in
third-quarter net income compared with the year-ago period.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade, influenced by seasonal
harvest pressure, rumors of Soviet grain purchases and volatile
outside markets.
   Dry conditions were expected to continue for most of the week in
the Midwest, where the corn and soybean harvest is believed to be
near the halfway point, analysts said.
   Rumors of Soviet buying interest in U.S. corn and soybeans
provided modest support to those markets.
   But a steep drop in crude oil and petroleum prices on the New
York Mercantile Exchange tended to defuse inflation fears, which
helped limit gains in grain prices, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $2.63 a bushel; corn
was 1} cents to 2} cents higher with December at $2.30\ a bushel;

   World stocks of cocoa have reached the highest
level ever, following the sixth straight season of overproduction,
the Internaional Cocoa Organization reported Monday.
   The 41-nation body estimated total inventories of cocoa at the
end of the 1989-90 (October-September) season at 1.391 million
tons.
   It put 1989-90 world production at 2.377 million tons - the
second biggest figure ever recorded and 167,000 tons more than
consumption.
   The all-time production high was 2.447 million tons reached in
1988-89, when the market was in surplus by a record 309,000 tons,
the organization said.
   Malaysia and Indonesia achieved record cocoa harvests in
1989-90, which together with a bigger crop in Brazil helped to
offset the declines in the Ivory Coast and most of the rest of
Africa, organization estimates show.
   Traders said years of oversupply have weakened the world market,
where prices earlier this year dropped to the lowest level in 13
years.
   They have recovered from the low point partly on worries that
dry weather may have damaged new season African crop prospects.

<HEAD>Phillips Earnings Double, Other Oil Companies Also Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. reported Monday its third-quarter
earnings doubled partly because of rising oil prices, while Arco
and Ashland Oil Inc. also reported sharp earnings gains.
   But all three companies said they did not pass the full cost of
the higher prices to customers.
   ``During the quarter, crude oil prices increased about 53 cents
a gallon while our wholesale gasoline prices only increased about
36 cents a gallon,'' said C.J. Silas, Phillips chief executive
officer.
   Lodwrick M. Cook, chief executive of Arco, said the company
``made every effort'' to hold its gasoline prices down.
   Phillips earned $178 million or 72 cents a share on revenues of
$3.43 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30 The Bartlesville,
Okla.-based company made $87 million, 36 cents a share, on revenues
of $3.07 billion during the third quarter of 1989.
   For the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Phillips earned $542
million or $2.21 a share on revenues of $9.54 billion. That's up
from $474 million or $1.95 a share on revenues of $9.46 billion in
the year-ago period.
   Arco earned $462 million or $2.79 a share, on revenues of $4.82
billion in the third quarter, vs. $379 million or $2.19 a share on
revenues of $3.71 billion in the same period a year ago.
   Los Angeles-based Arco froze retail gas prices for two weeks in
August following President Bush's appeal for companies to hold
retail prices down. Arco's third quarter results also include about
$80 million from the settlement of a dispute over an offshore
accident and sale of its Norwegian assets.
   For the nine months, Arco earned $1.45 billion or $8.70 a share
on revenues of $13.1 billion, vs. $1.55 billion or $8.87 a share on
revenues of $12 billion during the same period in 1989.
   Ashland earned $59 million or $1.06 a share, on revenues of $2.5
billion for the latest quarter, which ended its fiscal year. That
was a sharp reversal from the same quarter in 1989, when Ashland
lost $39 million or 71 cents a share, on revenues of $2.3 billion.
   Ashland closed its year with earnings of $182 million or $3.27
per share on revenue of $9.05 billion. In fiscal 1989, the company
made $86.2 million or $1.55 a share on revenue of $8.54 billion.
   The Ashland, Ky.-based company reported gains from the sale of
its Valvoline oil brand in the latest quarter. But the company said
its Super America gasoline division showed lower profits because
retail gas prices did not keep up with higher oil prices.

<TEXT>
   Bankers' hands could be tied in the coming
year by lawmakers bent on correcting the mistakes that led to the
savings and loan crisis, a top industry official said Monday.
   Kelly Holthus, outgoing president of the American Bankers
Association, warned his colleagues of congressional overreaction in
a farewell speech to the organization's annual convention.
   ``The temptation for Congress to take drastic measures in the
current political environment is strong,'' said Holthus, whose term
expires Tuesday.
   ``All of us will have to work hard to make sure that commercial
banks are not tarnished by the S&amp;Ls' record. Otherwise, we'll
surely find ourselves the victims of misguided legislation.''
   Leaders of the banking industry say they expect a rash of
legislation affecting their industry in the next Congress, and at
this week's ABA convention they are firing up the lobbying machine.
   ``It's up to us to make sure that in politicians' zeal to
correct a wrong - the banking industry doesn't end up battered
instead,'' Holthus said.
   Several of the nation's top banks are having trouble because of
the slowdown in the economy and fallout from bad loans. But those
attending the ABA meeting are going to great lengths to distance
themselves from the thrift ind yearly.
   ``Ninety-five percent of this package essentially is demanding
serious sacrifice from everyone else, veterans, government
employees, working families,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman
Leon Panetta, D-Calif. ``We think it's fair to let millionaires pay
their fair share.''
   But GOP senators were ardently against the idea, arguing that
imposing a surtax on some taxpayers would invie boosts later on
for everyone. After days of bargaining, Democrats were considering
other plans, which House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
described as ``infinitely changeable.''
   The two sides were entertaining similar offers in other
unresolved areas.
   They seemed near agreeing that the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline
tax would increase by a nickel or perhaps slightly more. And while
Democrats wanted to reduce the growth of Medicare by about $44
billion over the next five years, Republicans wanted to slash to be
about $3 billion deeper.
   But participants emphasized that nothing had been settled in
either of those areas. Democrats were saying the more taxes they
could raise from the wealthy, the milder the Medicare reductions
would be.
   ``M and M is still the problem, millionaires and Medicare,''
Panetta said.
   There were even hints that the gasoline tax might not be raised
at all.
   Rep. Dale Kildee, D-Mich., said Gephardt told him it would be
difficult for Democrats to achieve the 10 percent surtax on the
wealthy, but indicated it might be possible to leave the gasoline
tax alone.
   Last year, 65,000 families reported earning more than $1 million
on their income-tax returns. Boosting tax rates on the wealthiest
people would mean an increase for 600,000 families.
   Bargaining was also continuing over raising the $51,300 ceiling
below which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax is deducted from
paychecks. Democrats want to boost the cap to $125,000, Republicans
to $98,000.
   The bill, when completed, would be the cornerstone of $500
billion worth of savings over the next five years. The rest of the
deficit-cutting would come from restraining the defense budget in a
separate bill and from savings from projected payments on the
national debt.
   White House budget chief Richard Darman was in the Capitol
Monday participating in the talks. On Sunday, White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu and other administration officials left the
meetings, complaining that Democrats were not responding to GOP
offers. The meetings went on without them.

   The stock market finshed mixed today after a
quiet, meandering session.
   Analysts said buyers were leery of chasing after the sharp runup
in stock prices late last week, given persistent uncertainties over
the business outlook.
   Government budget talks bogged down over the weekend, leaving a
major problem facing investors unresolved.
   At the same time, however, brokers said the mood in the
marketplace had been given a big lift by the recent slide in oil
prices.
   Crude oil for November delivery, which ended last week at $33.79
a barrel, tumbled to the neighborhood of $28.50 a barrel today on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   If inflationary pressures abate, many observers believe the
Federal Reserve will be encouraged to relax its credit policy.

   The dollar strengthened Monday against all major
currencies in worldwide trading.
   Gold prices declined.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $369.60 a troy ounce, down $3.20 from Friday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold of
$369.50 an ounce, off $3.25.
   Currency dealers said internal market influences were largely
responsible for the dollar's across-the-board gain even though the
currency remains fundamentally weak. Some dealers said the dollar
had been due for a ``correction'' following its rapid decline over
the past few weeks.
   The plunge in oil, by more than $5 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange on Monday, helped the Japanese yen, since Japan
is heavily dependent on oil imports, dealers said. They said the
dollar was indirectly boosted by the subsequent cross-trading
between the yen and other currencies.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to a closing 126.25 Japanese yen from
125.25 yen Friday. The dollar traded at 126.00 yen in London, and
at 126.015 yen in New York, up from 125.95 yen Friday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound compared with
levels Friday. Sterling cost $1.9495 in London, less than $1.9590;
and $1.9455 in New York, down from $1.9585.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late quotes
on Friday, included: 1.5182 German marks, up from 1.5025; 1.2835
Swiss francs, up from 1.26805; 5.0815 French francs, up from
5.0295; 1,137.00 Italian lire, up from 1,124.25; and 1.17605
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17305.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.5135 German
marks, up from 1.5040; 1.2800 Swiss francs, up from 1.2700; 5.0662
French francs, up from 5.0380; 1.7060 Dutch guilders, up from
1.6940; 1,134.25 Italian lire, up from 1,127.00, and 1.1725
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1675.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $367.75 an ounce from
$372.75 Friday. In Zurich, gold was bid at $369.00 an ounce, down
from $372.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $4.22 an ounce to $371.36.
   Silver prices also slipped. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current deliery settled at $4.194 a troy ounce, down 6.4 cents
from late Friday. Silver fell in London to $4.21 an ounce from
$4.28.

<HEAD>Posts $91 Million Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time Warner Inc. said Monday it lost $91 million
in the third quarter due to the heavy costs associated with the
media and entertainment giant's merger last year.
   But the company said that excluding interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization costs, third-quarter earnings were up
4 percent from comparable results a year earlier.
   The quarter included record operating results from its filmed
entertainment recorded music, cable television and HBO programming
units.
   Operating results fell slightly in magazines for the quarter due
to losses at the new Entertainment Weekly magazine, while operating
earnings tumbled in books because of the absence of a contribution
from Scott Foresman and Co., the textbook publisher sold last
December.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Time Warner lost $4.05 a share
in contrast to a loss of $124 million, or $4.62 a share, on a pro
forma basis a year earlier. Interest, depreciation and amortization
costs amounted to more than $600 million in the latest quarter.
   The pro forma results for 1989 indicate what Time Warner would
have lost had Time Inc. owned all of Warner Communications Inc. for
the full year. Time bought a 59.3 percent interest in Warner in
July 1989 and acquired the remainder of Warner this past January.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 9 percent to $2.9 billion from
$2.66 billion a year earlier.
   Ed Atorino, who follows Time Warner for the investment firm
Salomon Brothers Inc., said the results showed a ``very solid''
operating performance.
   ``Although they lost a lot of money, the operating numbers were
very encouraging even for the magazine group,'' he said.
   In magazines, Time Warner said it had operating earnings of $38
million compared with $41 million a year earlier. The division
would have had record results as well despite the depressed state
of the magazine advertising market, company executives said, had it
not been for losses at Entertainment Weekly, the magazine of
entertainment reviews and features launched in February.
   The company failed to say how much the startup magazine lost in
the quarter, but Atorino said company executives told analysts that
seasonal factors produced a slightly larger loss than expected for
the quarter. He said the company previously had projected a $50
million loss on the magazine for the year, or about $12.5 million
per quarter.
   Other magazines in the group are Time, Life, People, Sports
Illustrated and Fortune.
   Operating profit in the book division fell to $16 million from
$66 million in the quarter a year ago when Scott Foresman
contributed profits of $57 million to the total.
   Operating earnings climbed 36 percent to a record $140 million
in filmed entertainment for the quarter, bolstered by record
domestic syndication revenue that included sales of the TV shows
``Head of the Class,'' ``Alf'' and ``Perfect Strangers.''
   In recorded music and music publishing, Time Warner has record
operating earnings of $109 million, up from $108 million a year
earlier led by domestic releases from Keith Sweat, AC-DC and Faith
No More.
   The cable TV group had record operating earnings of $198 million
in the quarter, up from $165 million a year earlier, and the
programming-HBO division had record operating earnings of $45
million, up from $42 million.
   For the first nine months of the year, Time Warner lost $193
million, or $10.59 a share, compared with a pro forma loss of $257
million, or $11.75 a share, a year earlier.
   Nine-month revenue rose 7 percent to $8.23 billion from $7.69
billion a year earlier.

   U S West signed a joint venture agreement on
Monday to build the first commercial cellular telephone network in
the Soviet Union.
   ``With the monumental changes occurring in the Soviet Union,
communications will play a vital part in the country's future
success,'' said Jack MacAllister, chairman of U S West.
   The agreement was signed in Leningrad with the Leningrad City
Telephone Network Production Association and the Leningrad Station
of Technical Radio Control.
   MacAllister said the agreement involves an initial $6 million
investment in cellular equipment by U S West International
Holdings, a subsidiary of U S West.
   The system is expected to serve 3,000 customers by mid-1991. It
could be expanded to serve 50,000 customers.
   U S West is providing technical, financial and operational
expertise for the project. The Soviets will provide interconnection
to the local network, local network talent, land, buildings and
labor.
   U S West began service to the first cellular system in Central
Europe in Budapest, Hungary, on Oct. 15.

   Crude oil prices plunged a record $5.41 a barrel
in heavy trading Monday on a combination of Middle East peace
hopes, technical trading factors and a report of an apparition
appearing to Saddam Hussein in his sleep.
   The drop in the November contract for light, sweet crude oil to
$28.38 per barrel marked the biggest single-day drop since futures
contracts began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
1983. The previous record was a $4-a-barrel decline on Aug. 17, the
Merc said.
   But the sudden erosion of the so-called ``war premium'' may not
show up at the gas pump anytime soon. Analysts said it would take
anywhere from three to 14 days for price movements to be passed
along to consumers, presuming the downward trend continued.
   Analysts cautioned that Monday's decline might have been
exacerbated by the expiration of the November contract. Activity
typically is volatile ahead of a contract's expiration as dealers
try to settle their accounts.
   The November crude contract, which had traded above $40, lost
$6.50 a barrel last week. The last time the near-term contract
traded below $29 was in the second week of September.
   Other contract months fell $3 a barrel, the limit for contracts
beyond next month. Because the difference in the decline between
those contracts and the November contract was so great, traders are
expecting prices to fall further at Tuesday's opening.
   Prices for refined products traded on the Merc also plummeted.
The November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoline, which lost
9.22 cents last week, fell 11.41 cents to settle at 76.50 cents a
gallon.
   The contract for home heating oil for current delivery declined
12.42 cents to settle at a 75.98 cents a gallon after losing nearly
17 cents last week. The November contracts for refined products do
not expire until next week.
   Oil prices began tumbling in Europe's energy pits and opened
sharply lower in New York as markets reacted to comments by Saudi
Arabian Defense Minister Prince Sultan, who suggested that Arab
countries were willing to grant Iraq ``all its rights.''
   Market observers called Sultan's comments the most conciliatory
since the crisis began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
His comments were interpreted as a sign that Saudi Arabia was
prepared to agree to Kuwait ceding some land to Iraq.
   Traders pushed prices lower on the belief that this development
might lead to a peaceful resolution of the Gulf crisis.
   Unconfirmed rumors continued to tweak the market. One had Iraq
pulling back its troops, while a more outlandish report appearing
in a Kuwaiti newspaper said Iraqi President Saddam was inclined to
withdraw from Kuwait because the prophet Mohammed instructed him to
do so in a dream.
   ``Between Saddam's dream and increasing supply and declining
demand, the market is weaker than the Oakland A's,'' said Peter
Beutel, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. of Hoboken,
N.J.
   On the fundamental side, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said oil production in September was 22.7 million barrels
a day, or about 200,000 barrels a day higher than previous
estimates, according to the Cyprus-based newsletter the Middle East
Economic Survey.
   Production at that level fully compensates for the shortfall
created by the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   ``The market has been in a downward mood for the past week and a
half . . . but the general consensus is that it will find
support,'' Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.F. &amp; Man
International Inc.
   Despite the drift lower, Fiedler said there remains a hefty
amount of skepticism that ``we've got peace breaking out overnight
as long as Saddam's in power.''
   In natural gas trading, the November contract closed at $1.970
per 1,000 cubic feet, up from $1.900 on Friday.

   The Persian Gulf crisis will mean billions
of dollars in higher oil revenues to the OPEC nations, Britain and
the Soviet Union, but Eastern Europe and the Third World will
suffer, a top U.N. official said Monday.
   ``A sharp rise in oil prices has darkened the prospects for
global growth and hit the oil-importing developing countries and
Eastern Europe particularly hard,'' said Rafeeuddin Ahmed, the
undersecretary-general for international economic and social
affairs.
   Oil prices have risen sharply since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, driving the price per barrel to about $40 earlier this
month. Prices tumbled Monday below $30, but their long-term
direction remains unclear.
   Based on the pre-crisis per-barrel price of $21, developing
countries expecting to pay $30 billion for oil in 1991 will instead
face bills of $45 billion to $60 billion, Ahmed told the General
Assembly's Second Committee, which deals with economics.
   ``For many of these countries, this will be an unbearable
additional burden,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and his
Mexican counterpart, Jaime Serra Puche, on Monday began a five-city
tour to promote a proposed U.S.-Mexico free trade agreement that
would eliminate trade barriers between the countries.
   The pair told 300 Houston business and civic leaders attending
the first full day of the traveling seminar on U.S. and Mexico
business alliances that the free trade agreement could enhance
economic opportunities for both countries and make North America
more competitive with the European Economic Community.
   Canada reached a similar agreement with the United States two
years ago and is considering joining the proposed alliance as a
trilateral agreement.
   ``This is a win-win situation,'' Mosbacher said. ``We will be
creating more jobs and more business on both sides of the border.''
   He said there will be more U.S. jobs in the form of management
teams and business owners and investors as well as complimentary
firms in the United States while Mexico will benefit with more
jobs, less outward migration and a more structured economy.
   ``The growth in Mexico is likely to produce increased demand for
U.S. goods,'' Mosbacher said. He estimated U.S. exports to Mexico
could rise from $52 billion last year to $100 billion by the year
2000.
   But he said that increase would depend on the approval of the
agreement by Mexico over the next two years and in the coming
months in Congress.
   ``If all goes well, we can hope to have an agreement in force by
early 1993,'' Mosbacher said. He predicted such a pact would
produce ``a combined output 36 percent more than the entire EC's.''
   Serra said recent advancements in Mexico to stabilize the
economy by reducing trade tariffs have laid the basis for serious
negotiations for an alliance.
   ``In 1982, Mexico was one of the most closed economis of the
world and today Mexico is one of the most open economies of the
world,'' Serra said. He noted the nation's more relaxed trade
restrictions that dropped import licensing requirements for 100
percent to less than 2 percent of imports during that period. At
the same time, the maximum tariff dropped from 100 percent to 20
percent, encouraging more import investments.
   Serra said Mexico also has allowed two-thirds of its firms to be
100 percent open to foreign ownership, dropped its effective tax
rates to encourage business development and cut regulations on its
transportation and shipping industries.
   ``In Mexico, we are committed to becoming a world-class
competitor,'' Serra said.
   Mexico is the United States' third largest trading partner,
behind only Canada and Japan.
   ``From the beginning of this century, the U.S. has been Mexico's
biggest trading partner,'' Serra said.
   The ``Road Show,'' as Mosbacher and Serra call their series of
information seminars will continue in Dallas, New York, Chicago and
Los Angeles in the next four days.

   The Treasury Department on Monday postponed a
$19.2 billion auction of 13-week and 26-week bills because of
inaction on legislation raising the debt limit.
   It was the second auction within a week to be delayed because
the debt ceiling has been reached. The Treasury on Thursday
postponed an auction of $10.75 billion in 52-week bills.
   The debt limit dropped from $3.195 trillion to $3.12 trillion
Saturday and a bill to raise the ceiling is mired in negotiations
between the Bush administration and Congress over a budget for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   The Treasury had planned to offer $9.6 billion each of 13-week
and 26-week bills in its weekly auction Monday.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said Monday the average yield for
one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes
in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.58 percent last week, down
from 7.62 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>Gold Hangs Tough Against Oil Price Collapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices fell Monday on New York's Commodity
Exchange, but analysts said the metal held up well against a
record-breaking plunge in oil prices in response to speculation
Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures also
fell, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.20 to $3.40 lower in New York with the
contract for spot delivery at $369.60 a troy ounce; silver ended
6.4 cents to 6.9 cents lower with the spot contract at $4.194 a
troy ounce.
   Gold and oil prices often move in sync, because precious metals
are considered a safe haven when oil is rising. But gold did not
respond as strongly to oil's recent gains as many observers
expected it would. And on Monday, gold did not fall as sharply as
the conventional wisdom would dictate.
   In oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract
for November delivery of light, sweet crude oil fell $5.41 to
$28.38 a barrel in the market's sharpest move since crude oil
futures began trading in 1983.
   The previous record move was a $4-a-barrel drop on Aug. 27.
Other crude oil futures tumbled $1.38 to $3 a barrel.
   Crude oil's loss, combined with a $3.01 decline on Friday,
represented a 23 percent drop in the near-term delivery price in
just two days. During the same period, the spot gold price fell 50
cents, or a little more than 1 percent.
   Frederick Demler, metals analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said
gold's performance indicates the gold market never perceived
$40-a-barrel crude oil as a sustainable price.
   He said the fact that gold prices did not collapse along with
oil was ``bullish overall'' for the gold market.
   Oil prices plummeted amid increasing speculation that the
standoff in the Persian Gulf is moving toward a peaceful

   The sell-off was prompted in part by a Kuwati newspaper report

   Loral Corp., which is acquiring the
communications and weather satellite business of Ford Motor Corp.,
is taking on three European firms as partners in the venture, Loral
announced Monday.
   Loral said it had signed memoranda of understanding with
Aerospatiale Societe Nationale Industrielle, Alcatel NV and Selenia
Spazio SpA, who are expected to pay $182 million for 49 percent of
the new firm, Space Systems-Loral.
   Space Systems-Loral is part of Ford Aerospace Corp., which Loral
is acquiring from Ford Motor for $715 million. Ford Aerospace's
other space-related businesses, whose main customers are the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Pentagon, are
not part of the deal announced Monday.
   Loral said it would retain a 51 percent stake in Space
Systems-Loral and would be responsible for managing the business.
   Space Systems-Loral is expected to design, manufacture and
support telecommunications and weather satellites. Under Ford
Aerospace, the business has been responsible for the Intelsat VII
telecommunications satellites.
   Loral said its prospective partners have worked with Ford
Aerospace since the early 1970s on projects including the
Intelsats.

<DATELINE>STOUGHTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reebok International Ltd., blaming
sluggish U.S. sales of its footwear, reported a 17 percent drop in
third quarter earnings Monday.
   Reebok said earnings totaled $41 million, or 36 cents per share,
for the quarter that ended Sept. 30. That compared with earnings of
$49.8 million, or 44 cents per share, for the same period a year
earlier.
   Sales for the quarter increased to $588.8 million from $524.5
million in the same three-month period in 1989.
   Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive officer, said sales
for the Reebok brand outside the United States exceeded $360
million during the first three quarters, an increase of 119
percent.
   Last month, the company said it expected third quarter earnings
would drop to the 33-35 cent per share range, due to lower U.S.
sales of its Reebok brand footwear and higher advertising and
promotional expenses.
   Fireman said the results were slightly higher than expected
because of increased shipments from the company's international
division and better-than-anticipated U.S. sales.
   For the first nine months of 1990, earnings totaled $137.1
million, or $1.20 per share, on sales of $1.67 billion. That
compared with earnings of $140 million, or $1.23 per share, on
sales of $1.44 billion in the same period a year earlier.

<HEAD>Institutes Paint Gloomy Picture for East German Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly half of former East Germany's
workers will have fewer working hours or no job at all by next
year, Germany's five leading economic institutes predicted Monday.
   It was one of the gloomiest employment forecasts ever for East
Germany, which united with West Germany on Oct. 3.
   Economic growth is also slowing in what used to be West Germany
and growth for the whole nation will likely reach only 1.5 percent
in 1991, the institutes said.
   Two top German officials responded to the report by saying its
unemployment prognosis for eastern Germany was too pessimistic. New
investment in the region will quickly create new jobs, Economics
Minister Helmut Haussmann and Finance Minister Theo Waigel said.
   The five institutes said about 1.1 million people in former East
Germany are either jobless or working shorter weeks. The region now
has 8.4 million workers.
   The region's unemployment problem will peak sometime next year
with 1.7 million jobless and 2 million others working fewer hours,
the report forecast. The region will average about 1.4 million
jobless and 1.75 million with fewer working hours in 1991, it said.
   Workers in the region are losing their jobs because many aging
factories and businesses are unable to compete in the new
free-market system. The report predicted that production in eastern
Germany will stailize by the middle of 1991, but that the job
market won't immediately benefit.
   ``The necessary transformation of the east German economy will
need much time,'' the report said.
   The report said the economic transformation of former East
Germany is occurring more slowly than expected because of a slow
rate of privatization, questions of property ownership, the
continued existence of ``monopolistic operations'' and difficulties
in ``building up a public sector that is capable of achievement.''
   The institutes also said a slowdown of the world economy and
shrinking exports will limit Germany's overall growth.
   In former West Germany, economic growth in 1991 will slow from 4
percent predicted for 1990 to 2.5 percent, the institutes forecast.
   The report was published by the DIW German Institute for
Economics in Berlin, the HWWA Institute for Economic Research in
Hamburg, the IFO Economic Research Institute in Munich, the
Institute for World Economics in Kiel and the RWI Economic Research
Institute in Essen.
   The report assumed that oil prices would gradually decline,but
remain higher than they were before Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The researchers said they did not expect higher oil prices to
dampen the German economy as long as wages don't climb. But they
acknowledged that the Gulf crisis presented considerable risks to
any forecast.

<HEAD>Former Junk Bond Customer To Plead Guilty To Criminal Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond
customer with close ties to Michael Milken has agreed to plead
guilty to criminal charges related to dealings with the firm, a
federal prosecutor said Monday.
   The government was expected to use the plea by Richard
Grassgreen, who resigned last week as chairman of Enstar Group
Inc., to bolster its case at a pre-sentencing hearing on new
allegations against Milken.
   The disclosure by Assistant U.S. Attorney Jess Fardella came
during the sixth day of testimony on charges that Milken committed
an array of crimes beyond the six felony counts to which he has
pleaded guilty.
   Fardella said Grassgreen will plead guilty to two felony counts
for personally receiving fees on financings paid for by Kinder-Care
Inc., Enstar's predecessor. Grassgreen's lawyer, William Schwartz,
did not return a call seeking comment.
   Kinder-Care, a Montgomery, Ala.-based day care company, was
built largely with money raised by Drexel through the sale of
high-yield junk bonds. Grassgreen and Milken had a close
relationship and Milken and his advisers often pointed to
Kinder-Care as an example of a successful junk bond-financed
company.
   Details of the charges against Grassgreen were not disclosed.
But people familiar with his case said they were related to
misappropriating corporate funds and failing to disclose to his
board his personal interest in MacPherson Investment Partners, a
fund created by Drexel that invested in Storer Communications Inc.,
another Drexel-financed takeover deal.
   The 1985 Storer takeover is one of the main subjects of the
special pre-sentence hearing on Milken underway in federal court.
   Prosecutors have sought to show Milken misappropriated valuable
Storer stock warrants and used them to bribe customers into buying
risky Storer securities.
   The accusation is part of the government's attempt to show
Milken was a systematic lawbreaker. They want to convince U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood he deserves a severe punishment. He faces
28 years imprisonment.
   Grassgreen was expected to testify as a witness at the Milken
hearing on Tuesday about the Storer transaction, along with former
Drexel chief executive Frederick Joseph. It would be Joseph's first
public testimony against Milken.
   On Monday, a lawyer who worked for Drexel said he questioned
whether the firm had properly disclosed plans to allocate millions
of dollars worth of Storer equity to important clients and Drexel
employees.
   According to the government's charges, five Drexel-affiliated
investment partnerships acquired 82 percent of certain Storer
equity warrants without legally disclosing the interests.
   A large block of the preferred stock and the warrants were
repurchased by Drexel from a customer, Atlantic Capital, shortly
after the Storer deal was completed and in turn sold to MacPherson,
one of the Drexel-formed investment partnerships.
   It consisted of several Drexel employees and major investors the
government claims were given a stake by Milken as gratuities.
One-third of the partnership was held by a trust for Milken's
children. The outside parties included Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Chairman Thomas Spiegel, takeover strategist Nelson Peltz and
Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Ray Arani.
   The government has charged that Drexel client David Solomon was
sold an interest in MacPherson to compensate for trades conducted
by Drexel to help him generate illegal tax losses, a transaction
included in Milken's guilty plea.
   The Drexel lawyer, Craig Cogut, testified that the failure to
disclose the 82 percent stake in the Storer raised questions in his
mind. ``I was concerned as to whether it was appropriate for
individual representatives of clients to receive these partnership
interests,'' he said.
   Cogut also said that a fund manager who was given a stake in
MacPherson in 1987 became concerned whether the investment was
appropriate.
   But he said he did not discuss the disclosure with Milken. He
also said Milken's brother Lowell handled the bulk of drafting
documents and structuring the Storer deal, and that he had very
little contact with Michael Milken.
   The government dropped criminal charges against Lowell Milken as
part of Michael Milken's guilty plea in April.

<HEAD>Nintendo to Allow Licensees to Manufacture Own Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nintendo Co., which has strictly
controlled the manufacture of games for its entertainment systems,
has offered U.S. companies that design the games the chance to
manufacture them, a company spokeswoman said Monday.
   Lynne Gray, a spokeswoman for Nintendo in Los Angeles, said the
company sent a memo to its licensees on Oct. 3, offering the chance
for them to manufacture their designs.
   No one has signed up yet to do so, Gray said, describing the
program as experimental.
   The Japanese company licenses designers to produce games for its
patented systems and manufactures the game cartridges itself in
Japan. Nintendo's wildly popular computer system revitalized the
video game industry in this country.
   Gray said the experimental offer was unrelated to a Federal
Trade Commission investigation of Nintendo for possible
anti-competitive practices.
   Nintendo had been studying the possibility of allowing games to
be manufactured by licensees for some time, Gray said. It waited,
she said, until it could be assured that quality control could be
maintained by outside manufacturers.
   Nintendo makes many of its own games, including its No. 1 game,
``Super Mario Bros. 3,'' which has sold 8 million copies since its
introduction earlier this year. It licenses 53 other companies to
design games, but maintains exclusive marketing rights.
   Nintendo, whose subsidiary Nintendo of America Inc. is based in
this Seattle suburb, estimates total video game market retail sales
for 1990 at $5.1 billion. Of that, Nintendo estimates it will
capture $4.1 billion or 80 percent.
   It forecasts it will sell about 9 million of its game systems
this year. The systems range in price from $79.95 to $149.95.
   Nintendo spokesman Richard Lindner said the FTC investigation
stemmed from allegations made late last year by Rep. Dennis Eckart,
D-Ohio, that Nintendo was stifling competition. Lindner said the
FTC has been examining company records and talking with officials
from Nintendo and its licensees, competitors and retailers since
shortly after the first of the year.

<HEAD>American Express Third-Quarter Profit Increases 3.6 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Express Co. said Monday its
third-quarter profit rose 3.6 percent as its travel-related
business flourished but its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage
subsidiary posted a loss for the period.
   American Express said it earned $343.8 million, or 74 cents per
share, up from $331.8 million, or 77 cents per share, in the same
quarter of 1989. The drop in per-share earnings reflected an
increase in the number of American Express' outstanding shares.
   The company's revenue tumbled 6.8 percent to $6.06 billion from
$6.5 billion a year earlier.
   The decline was largely attributable to a slump in revenue at
Shearson, where sales fell 23.3 percent to $2.52 billion from $3.28
billion. Shearson recorded a loss of $5.4 million, compared with
earnings of $40.9 million in the same period of 1989.
   American Express blamed the loss on the slowdown on Wall Street
that has put a crimp in business at many investment firms. American
Express also noted that third-quarter 1989 earnings at Shearson
were boosted by an after-tax gain of $37 million from the sale of
its institutional money management division.
   Earnings at other American Express subsidiaries rose.
   The company's travel-related business, which includes its charge
card and travelers check operations, earned $277.1 million in the
third quarter, up 15.1 percent from $240.8 million last year.
American Express said the number of its outstanding credit cards
increased 7.3 percent to 36.2 million from a year earlier.
   The company's IDS Financial Services subsidiary recorded a
third-quarter profit of $55.9 million, up 17.6 percent from $47.6
million in the same period of 1989.
   American Express Bank, which operates largely outside of the
United States, reported earnings of $34.7 million, up more than 63
percent from $21.3 million a year earlier.
   And American Express Information Services reported earnings of
$26.7 million, up nearly 24 percent from $21.6 million the previous
year.
   For the first nine months of 1990, American Express earned $43.6
million, or 4 cents per share, on revenue of $18.34 billion. During
the same period in 1989, the company earned $899.8 million, or
$2.09 per share, on revenue of nearly $18.73 billion.
   The nine-month figure reflects Shearson's $915 million
first-quarter loss that resulted from a restructuring of the Wall
Street firm.

   House and Senate negotiators approved a
clean-air bill Monday that is expected to eventually cost the
economy $22 billion a year and affect most of American society by
toughening pollution controls on automobiles, factories and power
plants.
   The bargainers worked out the final details before dawn, ending
more than a year of bargaining between the two chambers. Late
Monday afternoon, the conference committee gave the measure formal
endorsement, with only Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., opposing
it.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called the
legislation ``historic in its significance'' and said he expected
both the Senate and House to endorse it and President Bush to sign
it into law. Final approval from both chambers is expected by
week's end.
   Bush, meanwhile, noted that tougher clean-air legislation ``has
been 13 years in coming'' and said that ``no American should have
to wait another day for clean air.''
   Republican members of the clean-air conference, including Rep.
Norman Lent of New York and Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island,
predicted that Bush would sign the bill.
   Late Monday, White House officials indicated that the president
would likely look favorably on the bill, including the compromise
job-assistance program.
   ``While we have to take a look at the final language, we are
encouraged by the agreement reached on (the jobs assistance)
amendment,'' said White House spokesman Steve Hart.
   Earlier, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater had
indicated that the administration was still not satisfied by worker
assistance program, although he too said the administration ``has
not signaled a veto.''
   Under the legislation, there would be drastic reductions in
emissions of acid rain pollutants and toxic industrial chemicals.
In addition, more than 100 cities would be given five to 15 years
to bring their air quality up to federal standards, mainly by
controlling pollutants that cause smog.
   The new requirements would be expensive, although cost estimates
vary widely.
   The White House estimates the legislation would cost the economy
$11 billion a year by 1995 and $22 billion to $25 billion annually
by 2005, when the bill's provisions would take full effect.
Industry estimates have put the cost in the $30 billion to $50
billion range toward the end of the decade.
   While conceding that the controls would cost in the tens of
billions of dollars, environmentalists have argued that much of the
cost can be expected to be made up from savings in health costs.
The American Lung Association estimates that perhaps $50 billion a
year could be saved in reduced health expenses from cleaner air.
   To improve air quality, the nearly 700-page bill would:
   -Tighten controls on tailpipe emissions, cutting smog-causing
pollutants from motor vehicles by 30 percent to 60 percent.
Businesses such as dry cleaners would also have to cut
smog-producing emissions.
   -Require the sale of cleaner gasoline blends in cities with the
worst smog problems and a phase-in of alternative-fuel vehicles in
taxi and other fleets. A pilot program using private
alternative-fuel cars would also be started in California.
   -For the first time control industrial releases of 189 toxic
chemicals, including many carcinogens, through the installation of
pollution-control equipment. Toxic air emissions, which total more
than 2.4 billion pounds a year, would be cut by 90 percent by the
end of the decade.
   -Reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power
plants by 10 million tons, cutting nearly in half such acid
rain-producing emissions. Midwestern utilities, reliant on
high-sulfur coal, would be hit the hardest.
   Many of the plants will have to install expensive ``scrubbers''
or switch to low-sulfur coal. Those prospects have led many
lawmakers to call for a financial aid program for miners who lose
their jobs because of the tougher pollution controls.
   As they finished work on the bill, the negotiators agreed to a
$250 million, five-year program to help workers who lose their
jobs, but only if tied to a retraining program with strict
qualification standards.
   Congress worked more than a year to craft the legislation as
lawmakers struggled to find compromises that would overcome strong
regional interests amid intense lobbying from the myriad of
affected industries.
   The House and the Senate approved separate versions of clean-air
legislation earlier this year, but the task of reconciling
differences proved slow and difficult.
   Indeed, while representatives of the two chambers began their
work in mid-July, there was no significant progress until earlier
this month, when agreement was reached on automobile pollution.
   House and Senate negotiators followed with agreements to reduce
toxic industrial chemicals and, on Sunday, reached an accord on
acid rain.

   Authorities arrested a former photo technician
for General Motors Corp. Monday on charges he tried to get the
automaker to pay $75,000 for stolen confidential photographs of GM
cars.
   Gregory Charles Hooper, 36, of Royal Oak, was charged with mail
fraud in a complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's office, the FBI
said. He was released on bond.
   Hooper faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine.
   The FBI began an investigation June 16 after receiving a
complaint from GM that some photographs of cars it was working on
were appearing in magazines. Hooper allegedly tried to obtain
$75,000 from GM for the return of the photographs, the FBI said in
a statement.
   Last November, GM offered a $30,000 reward for the arrest of
whomever was responsible for leaking pictures, slides and drawings
of a variety of future GM products to auto enthusiast magazines.
Among them were photos of what was described as the
yet-to-be-released 1991 Saturn automobile.
   ``Such crime has a profound impact on GM's future competitive
position and we will continue to cooperate with the FBI in its
investigation of how these materials were obtained and who may have
purchased them illegally,'' said GM spokesman Don Postma.
   Postma said Monday the $30,000 had not been paid.
