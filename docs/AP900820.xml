   Iraq announced Monday it had carried out a plan to move Western
hostages to vital military installations to deter any U.S. attack
and warned its people not to try to hide any of the thousands of
foreigners trapped in the country.
   With the United State building up its armed forces in Saudi
Arabia and blocking Iraqi ports with an armada of ships, the Iraqi
regime moved to use the Westerners as human shields.
   For the first time, President Bush publicly referred to the
3,000 Americans and the other Western captives as hostages.
``Whatever these innocent people are called, they are in fact
hostages,'' he said in Baltimore. He demanded their release.
   In a blow to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Iran announced
Monday that it will abide by a U.N. resolution ordering economic
sanctions against Iraq. This followed Saddam's moves last week to
make peace with Iran, his longtime enemy, so as to better focus on
his confrontation with the West.
   Late Monday, the U.N. Security Council met informally to pursue
possible U.N. action to enforce its embargo of Iraq. Diplomats
entering the meeting carried draft papers that called for members
to use ``all necessary action'' to enforce the embargo.
   The meeting occurred as an Iraqi tanker, one of two tankers
fired on Saturday by U.S. ships, was reported about to enter Yemeni
waters.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a spokesman for Baghdad's
National Council, or parliament, as saying: ``Iraq's foreign guests
have been in fact moved to all vital and military installations.
They have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all
in good physical condition.''
   It did not say how many foreigners were moved or give other
details.
   In Washington, the State Department reported that 12-14
Americans and some other foreigners were taken from their Kuwait
hotels and moved to undisclosed locations. A U.S. official said the
Americans included both men and women, adding, ``they may be going
to Baghdad.''
   Earlier Monday, Saddam's government informed diplomats they had
until Friday to close their missions in Kuwait or lose their
special status.
   Several countries said they had no plans to close their
embassies. They included Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland,
France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the Soviet Union and West Germany.
   In other developments Monday:
   _Israel said it will allow Egyptians fleeing Iraq and Kuwait to
travel through the Jewish state on their way home, Israeli TV said.
   _A U.S. Embassy spokesman said in Amman that American citizens
in Jordan were being advised to leave on a ``voluntary basis.''
   _An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted over the weekend
found that 72 percent of those surveyed approved of how Bush is
handling the crisis. Seventy percent said they approve of the
decision to send military forces to Saudi Arabia and the gulf. The
telephone poll had a margin of error of four percent, NBC said.
   _Jane's Defense Weekly in London reported that an Iraqi
freighter is heading to Jordan with 17 East German-made armored
bridgelayers. The bridgelayers are capable of crossing difficult
terrain because it has a 66-foot-long scissor-like bridge. Iraq
received seven last year in an earlier deal, the magazine said.
   _Amnesty International demanded the immediate release of all
foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and protested reported
human rights abuses by Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
   _American military cargo planes are being allowed to operate
from the United Arab Emirates, becoming the second gulf nation to
accept foreign troops in response to the Iraq crisis, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney said.
   _In New York, wholesale unleaded gasoline prices surged over the
$1 mark for the first time, boosted by the belief among traders
that the Mideast crisis will persist and continue creating tight
supplies.
   _In Hampton, Va., 20 F-117A Stealth fighters left Langley Air
Force base for deployment in the Middle East.
   _Col. Moammar Gadhafi criticized both Iraq and the United States
for provocative actions in the Mideast and threatened to withdraw
Libya from the United Nations.
   In warning their own people about harboring foreigners, Iraqi
authorities said Monday that anyone doing so faced the ``severest
punishment,'' according to Iraqi radio. The report said the rule
applied to Iraq's ``entire administrative border,'' apparently
including Kuwait.
   Iraq invaded the small emirate Aug. 2 after accusing it of
cheating on OPEC production quotas, thus driving down world oil
prices and depriving Iraq of billions of dollars in revenue. Iraq
declared four days later that it had annexed Kuwait and began
referring to it as a city in southern Iraq.
   Two senior U.N. officials went to Baghdad to press for release
of foreigners held in Kuwait and Iraq. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar said Saddam asked that the envoys be sent.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, appealed to
a visiting Iraqi deputy premier in Moscow to free the foreigners.
Tass said he ``expressed satisfaction'' to Saadoun Hammadi that
Soviet citizens were allowed to leave and asked for ``a similar
decision in relation to citizens of other states.''
   OPEC said there was not enough support among members to call an
emergency meeting on Saudi Arabia's request for increased output to
make up the shortage of 5 million barrels a day caused by the loss
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti production.
   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said Saturday his
country would increase production by up to 2 million barrels a day
with or without support from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Ship radios crackled Monday with the sounds of U.S. warships
challenging nearly every commercial vessel in the southern Persian
Gulf, but no Iraqi vessels were found in the area, shipping sources
reported.
   Addressing the national Veterals of Foreign Wars convention in
Baltimore, Bush said:
   ``We have been reluctant to use the term hostage. But when
Saddam Hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent
people are called, they are in fact hostages.
   ``And I want there to be no misunderstanding. I will hold the
government of Iraq responsible for the safety and well-being of
American citizens being held against their will.''
   On Sunday, Saddam offered to release foreigners if the United
States withdrew its forces from the Persian Gulf region and
promised to lift the economic embargo. U.S. officials refused.
   He said later he would free citizens of nations that remained
neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland,
Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of
the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraq said Monday that Indonesian and some Argentines would be
allowed to leave. China's official news agency, Xinhua, said the
first group of 97 Chinese was leaving and Tass said 122 Soviet
citizens crossed into Jordan on Monday, 346 had reached the border
and only 188 remain in Kuwait.
   Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia visited Damascus
on Monday to discuss the gulf crisis with Syrian leaders.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iraqi soldiers
continued withdrawing from occupied Iranian territory, freeing
thousands of troops to face U.S. forces. Iraq and Iran also are
repatriating prisoners from their eight-year war, which ended with
a cease-fire in August of 1988.
   Despite their newly established peace, however, Iran informed
Perez de Cuellar that as a U.N. member, it would go along with the
sanctions ordered by the world body, IRNA reported.
   The United States is pouring military personnel into Saudi
Arabia, and U.S. officials have said the deployment could reach
200,000. American warships and aircraft carriers are stationed in
and near the Persian Gulf.
   Other Western and Arab countries have contributed troops to the
growing multinational force, but it is predominantly American.

<HEAD>Jurors Hear Closing Arguments in Contra Supply Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contra supplier Eugene Hasenfus and a fellow
courier killed during a failed mission in Nicaragua had no formal
contract and knew the risks of the covert flight, defense attorneys
said Monday during closing arguments.
   But lawyers for Hasenfus and the family of Wallace Sawyer Jr.
say the men deserve to be ``taken care of'' for working on behalf
of a network, approved by the White House, to support the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua.
   Jury deliberations were scheduled to begin Tuesday in the
five-week civil trial, which was severely limited after U.S.
District Judge C. Clyde Atkins threw out a major portion of the
claims last week.
   All that remains to consider are some financial issues such as
whether Hasenfus is due back pay and if Sawyer's family can collect
death benefits from Gen. Richard Secord and Miami-based Southern
Air Transport.
   Atkins ruled Friday that jurors cannot consider damages for
mental stress suffered by Hasenfus or his wife, Sally, after the
plane was shot down by Sandinista troops in October 1986. Hasenfus
of Marinette, Wis., was the sole survivor of the crash. He was
detained for three months before being returned to the United
States.
   The judge also removed from the case claims seeking punitive
damages and allegations the aircraft was unsafe.
   Thomas Spencer, an attorney for Secord, said his client did not
have the authority to make a contract with Hasenfus or Sawyer, of
Magnolia, Ark., who went by the nickname ``Buzz.''
   ``My client didn't contribute to the death of Buzz Sawyer or the
harm to Gene Hasenfus,'' said Spencer. ``The White House called him
and asked to help with the resupply operation.''
   Southern Air attorney Robert Beckman said the carrier was just
one of several companies involved flights to supply the U.S.-backed
Contra rebels, who were fighting the Marxist Sandinista government
of Nicaragua.
   ``Hasenfus could just as well brought suit against the maker of
the parachute that saved his life,'' he said.
   Defense attorney Brian Strange told the jury Hasenfus and his
wife should at least be reimbursed for expenses connected to
Hasenfus' legal battle in Nicaragua.
   ``They were told their families would be taken care of and then
the defense comes before you and says, `Not us,''' said Strange.
   Secord helped former National Security Council aide Oliver North
organize the Contra supply network. Secord was sentenced to two
years' probation after pleading guilty to lying to Congress about
his role in the Iran-Contra affair.

   An advocacy group for the deaf sued state
education officials Monday, alleging the state's teacher
certification test discriminates against deaf people.
   The lawsuit filed in Travis County state district court is the
first challenge in the nation by deaf educators of a teacher
certification exam, the group said.
   One of the plaintiffs, Nancy Mumme, 32, said the test asks
questions about how to instruct students on the differences in the
sound of certain letters.
   ``How am I supposed to be identifying a sound?'' Ms. Mumme said
in sign language through an interpreter.
   The lawsuit against the Texas Education Agency and State Board
of Education says deaf people who want to become teachers shouldn't
have to take the test until it has been adjusted.
   The lawsuit was filed by the Texas Association of the Deaf and
Ms. Mumme.
   Jorjanna Price, a spokeswoman for the education agency, said
lawyers for the agency had yet to see the lawsuit.
   She said Education Commissioner W.N. Kirby has met with deaf
educators. ``He said he wanted to look into the test matter,'' Ms.
Price said.
   Ms. Mumme, who has a Maryland teaching certificate, failed the
Texas test twice.
   Despite favorable evaluations and performance as a classroom
teacher she was demoted last year and her contract at the Texas
School for the Deaf has been canceled for this school year,
according to the lawsuit.
   ``I have been very, very frustrated. I cried and cried after I
got my test results back,'' she said in an emotional statement at a
news conference.

<HEAD>Jeffersonian Idea Brings Power to Powerless in Rural South</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>APPOMATTOX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A quiet revolution is under way in dozens
of rural Southern counties where people historically unrepresented
are nurturing a shadow government to help them take ``the last step
up from slavery.''
   This alternative power structure, conceived by a descendant of
slaves and based on Thomas Jefferson's ideas, is called simply
``the assembly.''
   It has brought millions of dollars' worth of new schools, miles
of paved roads and, most important to the assembly members, who are
mostly black, a voice that can no longer be ignored.
   In Appomattox County, gospel songfests and candy sales helped
the local assembly raise $65,000, purchase six acres and clear the
land for a community center.
   ``We were always going from one place to another, having our
meetings,'' said Milton Chambers, the 36-year-old assembly
president, a foundry worker who lives three miles from the spot
where the Civil War ended 125 years ago.
   ``To have a building to call our own,'' he said, members gladly
sacrificed, some contributing hundreds of dollars.
   ``The only way to control our destiny,'' he said, ``is to be
able to turn on and cut off the lights when we want to.''
   In a phrase, he was stating the goal and purpose of the 40-odd
assemblies in Virginia and other Southern states: organization for
self-help and representation.
   ``I'll say it 'til I die, if you give people something, you'll
build dependency,'' said Don Anderson, a black former congressional
committee lawyer who created the assembly system. ``But if you just
organize the voluntarism, they'll do it themselves. ...
   ``And once it's done it's like magic.''
   For 22 years, Anderson has been trying to work that magic
through his Washington, D.C.-based National Association for the
Southern Poor.
   With a staff of 10 and an annual budget of nearly $500,000,
mostly from individual donors and foundations, its goal is to
create assemblies in 258 Southern counties with low incomes and
black populations of about 30 percent to 80 percent.
   Anderson has written that his aim was to give these people ``a
vehicle for solving their problems, and for taking the last step up
from slavery.''
   Most assemblies are in Virginia and North Carolina, but new ones
are being formed in Georgia and South Carolina and plans are to
expand to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee.
   To spread his self-help concept across the region, Anderson
touts assemblies' accomplishments to date: the paving of 20 miles
of roads in black areas of Washington County, N.C.; job training
for the hardcore unemployed in Portsmouth, Va.; $2.5 million in
water line extensions and home renovations through federal grants
in Jones County, N.C.; and many other projects.
   The assemblies operate within ``a very refined structure, based
on Jefferson's idea of ward republics,'' Anderson explained.
   ``We go into a county and divide it up into manageable groups of
50 people each,'' the equivalent of Jefferson's wards, Anderson
said. ``And these are represented in a central decision-making body
called the assembly.''
   To establish an assembly, Anderson's organizers usually spend
two months locating community leaders and bringing them together in
preliminary meetings. Anderson, who attends a final organizational
gathering, said it costs $18,000 on average to organize a county.
   Procedurally, the assembly is ``a very accurate copy of the
British House of Commons,'' said Anderson, who holds a degree from
the London School of Economics.
   At a recent meeting of the Assembly of Charlotte County, Va., in
a muggy school auditorium, members who were dressed as if for
church closely followed parliamentary rules _ calling ``questions''
printed on an agenda named the Order Paper, rising whenever
addressing the group, and directing all comments to the Speaker.
   The difference is that at the House of Commons, they don't serve
fried chicken and biscuits beforehand.
   Assembly members must be at least 18 and must be registered
voters. Although the groups are non-partisan, voter registration
often is a first-priority project.
   The relationship between the assembly and local elected
officials varies.
   ``I see it as a system to assist the government that's in
place,'' said Andrew Murray, who heads the assembly in Caswell
County, N.C.
   Others see it as a watchdog organization. The Appomattox
assembly and others have appointed members to monitor county
supervisor and school board meetings.
   In Surry County, Va., three assembly members sit on the
five-member county Board of Supervisors.
   ``So all the issues that come up in the assembly are heard by
members that can actually vote on them,'' said Surry Assembly
President Thomas Hardy, who also chairs the county planning
commission.
   Surry's assembly, founded 21 years ago, is the oldest and most
successful. Hardy proudly showed off its projects to a reporter.
Some came about through grants the group applied for, some through
its pressure on local officials:
   _ A neat, 50-unit subsidized apartment complex, built after the
assembly decried the falling-down, tin-roofed shacks that many
lived in, is to be expanded.
   _ A $1 million medical clinic put up by the assembly with
foundation grants has visiting specialists and is working to find
full-time doctors.
   _ A handsome $540,000 recreation center hums with activity: a
summer day camp program for schoolchildren, meetings of senior
citizens, civic group gatherings, even wedding receptions.
   As everyone benefits from the improvements, relations between
the races have improved, Hardy said. A white official, Sheriff W.C.
Andrews, agreed.
   ``It's a lot of times that maybe we don't see eye to eye,'' the
sheriff said. ``But we get together and try to work things out.''
   Of all the changes the assembly has brought in Surry, a farming
county where pork, peanuts and pines are grown, Hardy is proudest
of the schools.
   Before the assembly started its work with a house-by-house voter
registration drive that made clear the black majority, the schools
``were in a desperate condition,'' he said.
   At the high school, ``We didn't have a gymnasium; we didn't have
a cafeteria.''
   After integration was ordered, all but nine white students left
the 1,300-student district for private schools, according to a 1971
news story. Only two of the district's 60 teachers were white, but
whites held all but one seat on the school board.
   Now, there's a brand new $1 million elementary school, a $4
million high school. Surry's per capita student spending is $5,633,
nearly the highest in Virginia.
   And although the assembly sometimes criticizes the black
superintendent, ``He has been successful in working to bring at
least 80 percent of the white children back,'' Hardy said.
   The black-white ratio among students is now 73 percent to 27
percent, according to Martha Rollings, assistant to the
superintendent for instruction. In the general population, about
six out of 10 people are black, Hardy said.
   There are 58 black teachers, 34 white. Three blacks and two
whites sit on the school board.
   Improvement in standardized test scores has been dramatic. For
example, Surry eighth graders ranked in the eighth percentile
nationally in reading in 1979. Now they're at the 49th _ ``within
reach,'' Ms. Rollings said, of the national average 50th
percentile. ``We're working on it,'' she added.
   Anderson knows the statistics and the faces they represent.
   ``You don't have to think of symbolic changes,'' he said. ``You
can transform a whole community.''

   While politicians loudly ask who's to blame
for the savings and loan mess, regulators and analysts are quietly
asking a much more urgent question: Is commercial banking headed
for disaster too?
   ``The answer is yes,'' said economist R. Dan Brumbaugh of
Stanford University. ``We're already there.''
   He believes that more banks would be declared insolvent _ and
the government fund protecting $2.6 trillion in deposits at 12,500
banks would be broke _ if regulators stopped using outmoded
accounting methods to determine when a bank has failed.
   No, said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., which, through separate funds, guarantees both
bank and thrift deposits up to $100,000 per account.
   ``We will be able ... to handle any failures we can currently
foresee,'' he said. He vigorously disputes Brumbaugh's methodology
and conclusions.
   But from another perspective, the two sides are not far apart.
They are arguing about how bad the condition of the banking system
is, not whether it is in bad or good shape.
   The bank insurance fund is ``in a very much stressed position,''
Seidman conceded at a recent Senate hearing.
   Because bank deposits are nearly triple the $930 billion held by
savings institutions, the bank insurance fund's health has always
been potentially even more critical than the condition of the
now-bankrupt Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The funds were established half a century ago to restore
confidence in the nation's financial system after a wave of bank
and S&amp;L failures swept the nation during the Depression, wiping out
the savings of thousands of Americans.
   For decades, both funds thrived, supported by insurance premiums
paid by member institutions. But so many savings and loans failed
during the 1980s that taxpayers had to rescue the S&amp;L fund at a
cost now estimated as high as $500 billion over 40 years _ $2,000
for every man, woman and child in the nation.
   The bank fund has so far been able to handle bank failures,
though the balance has been dropping for three years now. And if it
falls to zero in the 1990s, taxpayers would have to bail out banks,
too.
   The bank fund, which ended 1987 with $18.3 billion, lost $4.24
billion in 1988, when bank failures hit a post-Depression high of
221. That was its first decline ever. When another 207 banks failed
last year, it lost an additional $851 million.
   Failures remain high in 1990 _ 121 through Aug. 16 _ and Seidman
has estimated the fund will lose around $2 billion, reducing it to
near $11 billion.
   A key ratio measuring the fund's health has been deteriorating
even longer. In 1963, the FDIC had $1.50 for every $100 in
deposits. By 1981, that had gradually eroded to $1.24. As failures
soared during the 1980s, the ratio plummeted. After this year's
loss, Seidman estimates it will be between 50 cents and 60 cents.
   Last week, his board proposed emergency action to battle the
decline, preliminarily endorsing a 62-percent increase in the
insurance premium banks pay. It is the maximum increase allowed by
law.
   The move would increase the FDIC's premium income from $2.8
billion in 1990 to $4.8 billion in 1991. Much of the added expense
will be passed on to depositors through higher fees for checking
accounts and other services.
   Analysts, however, say the added income would provide only a
little extra protection for taxpayers should soaring oil prices
trigger a recession and another wave of bank failures.
   ``The wild card right now in all these forecasts is Iraq,'' said
economist Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution, a
Washington-based, liberal think tank.
   ``Clearly, right now the fund is skating on the edge. It is
conceivable that it could get by if the economy escapes a recession
and if oil prices stabilize in the low- to mid-$20s'' a barrel, he
said. ``However, Iraq could change all that.''
   If the recession was deep, bank troubles in the 1990s could
dwarf those of the 1980s, which occurred despite an unprecedented
eight years of expansion in the national economy.
   An additional worry is that bank regulators, like S&amp;L regulators
before them, would be tempted to allow insolvent banks to remain
open. Then, with federal insurance guaranteeing their deposits, the
banks would have every motive to take wild risks. If they win, they
avoid bankruptcy. If they lose, taxpayers pay.
   A few analysts, like Brumbaugh, contend that is already
happening.
   ``The FDIC's behavior is deja vu all over again and it is
irresponsible,'' he said.
   However, others believe that, with the lesson of the S&amp;L mess
still fresh, bank regulators would appeal for taxpayer assistance
much earlier and Congress would respond more quickly.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
who made his reputation with early predictions of disaster for the
savings and loan fund, said comparisons between banks and S&amp;Ls are
overdone.
   ``Banks are fundamentally sounder institutions. ... And,
basically, the FDIC has not been sweeping the problems under the
rug to the extent that the (thrift regulators) were,'' he said.
   The root of the S&amp;L crisis was planted when the institutions
were created. They borrowed deposits short-term and lent the money
long-term to home buyers. When inflation pushed interest rates past
20 percent they had to pay more interest on their deposits than
they were earning on their mortgages.
   Cures applied in the early `80s _ expansion into new lending
areas coupled with lax oversight _ only worsened the problem.
   The roots of banking's woes are different, but still formidable.
   In the 1970s, the nation's largest banks had lent billions of
dollars to Third World countries, who by the 1980s were defaulting.
By the mid-80s, small farm banks began collapsing, along with
agriculture commodity and farm land prices.
   Then came the drop in oil prices, triggering a collapse in real
estate values in the Southwest. Now, real estate problems have
spread to the Northeast and are threatening the Southeast, Southern
California and even a few Midwestern cities.
   Longer-term, innovations in the financial system are eroding
banks' profitability. Their best deposit customers have been lured
to money market mutual funds. Their largest and most credit-worthy
borrowers raise money by issuing commercial paper, a service that
banks are substantially barred from delivering along with other
securities underwriting.
   Banks' defenders point out that the industry earned a record
$24.8 billion in 1988 and a respectable $15.7 billion in 1989.
Critics, however, say that does little to reduce the potential for
disaster.
   Although commercial banks collectively earned $6.2 billion in
the first three months of this year, 10 percent of them lost money
and 1,058 were considered ``problem'' institutions by the FDIC.
   ``Ten percent can easily send you under. Deep under,'' Litan
said. ``The 10 percent of the banks that are unprofitable ... hold
roughly the same assets that the open, but insolvent thrifts held
in the mid-1980s. We saw what they could do.''

   Arabs at seafront coffee shops have
stopped talking about soccer and turned their attention to the
Persian Gulf crisis and the American role in the Middle East.
   Puffing at water pipes in the cafes of this island state that
has become a banking and business center, Arabs from Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and elsewhere gather to endlessly discuss the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, the American response and where it all will
lead.
   ``America's image in the Arab world is 70 percent bright these
days,'' merchant Abdullah Ahmed suggested. ``But this will not
remain so in the fullness of tie of pro-Israeli
America will surface again, once the Kuwait crisis is over.''
   Listeners in white dishidasha gowns and kaffiyeh headgear nodded
approval.me. The ugly fac
   ``Don't tell me that (Saudi Arabian king) Fahd brought the
Americans to the Persian Gulf waters and the sacred land,'' said
one.
   ``Not at all,'' Ahmed responded. ``Saddam did. But, in the thick
fog of Arab politics, we'll hear many different versions to the
same story. Truth can easily be camouflaged.''
   Lawyer Mohammed Adel interjected loudly: ``No, no, no. First of
all, let's define the basic elements of our discussion, to gain
clarity and avoid moving i ``Four, all supposed warlike scenarios are
frightening and lots of innocent blood might be shed and someone
will likely be blamed for this. Besides, if Israel gets involved in
any military action against Saddam, all his Arab adversaries would
look very, very bad and his sins be forgotten.''
   A number of religious men, fingering worry beads, shouted
expressions of disapproval. One mosque keeper interjected, ``We go
by the book of Allah and say that Fahd is struggling with a clean
heart while Saddam resists with a dirty mind.''
   The loudspeaker blared an Egyptian song about Arab unity. Garage
owner Ali Juma had to raise his voice when he said ``the Kuwaitis
may have have been money-minded, but it is their money anyway and
no one has any right to blame them for investing it in whatever
manner they deem best for themselves.''
   Many people in the gulf consider Kuwaitis ``money-minded,'' and
they are widely considered clever investors and sharp traders.
   Abdullah Ahmed clapped, and the waiter replaced the burned out
tobacco in his water pipe. Inhaling smoke he said: ``I believe the
real crisis is yet to unfold. What we see now is merely a spark.
The harm is done, regardless of how the crisis will be ended.''
   The garage man said, ``Saddam's mistake rests really with the
enormity of his overblown reaction to Kuwait's economic affronts.
Instead of pulling Kuwaiti ears he punched into their houses, raped
their women, deflowered their daughters, and looted their jewelry.''
   ``And I say the real crisis will unfold when the poor Arabs
begin to demand financial help from the rich Arabs,'' said Ahmed,
``sometimes peacefully and sometimes by force.''
   And Saddam?
   ``One eventuality envisions the Iraqi people brightening their
image and getting rid of Saddam,'' said Ahmed. But he also spoke of
an alternative that saw an ``anti-Iraq economic blockade persisting
and Saddam's machinations succeeding in stirring the Arab masses
against one government or another, thus giving him a broader
popularity and support.''
   Another posibility, he said, was that ``the Americans might
provoke a fight and usher in the Israelis, which means Saddam would
die and become an Arab martyr.''
   The lawyer summed it up.
   ``I told you, the future is bleak,'' he said. ``There are
several options, the sweetest of which is bitter.''

<HEAD>Text of Saddam's Message To The Families of Stranded Westerners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's message Sunday to the families of Westerners
stranded in Kuwait and Iraq. His remarks were carried by the
official Iraqi media and translated by The Associated Press:
   Ladies and gentlemen; dear children:
   I know that you are pained because your relatives are not
allowed to leave Iraq. I am just as pained as you are. I am fully
convinced that the speaker and members of the Iraqi National
Council are also pained and so are all Iraqis and Arabs. ...
   We are all sorry for what happened. It was not of our own
making, but the outcome of the will of certain people who acted
arbitrarily and deviated from the will and teachings of God. The
responsibility for all this lies directly with U.S. administration
and the British government. ...
   Gentlemen, you may not know that this country whose rulers
concocted plots (Kuwait) was part of Iraq until 1913 and that Iraq
did not recognize it until the 1960s; that the Iraqi prime minister
issued a decision in 1961 annexing Kuwait, turning it once again
into a district linked to Al-basrah, and appointing its sheikh as
governor as was the case before World War I. ...
   Why do the U.S. president and the British prime minister want to
starve the Iraqi people to death? Cursed be what they are doing.
What have the Iraqi people done other than unite themselves and the
families that were divided by circumstances in Iraq and Kuwait,
defend themselves, and help oust the backward Kuwaiti sheikh, whose
only concern was collecting money and women?
   Why are they imposing a siege on Iraq to kill the babies and
elderly as well as those who cannot get food and medicine. ... Why
are they massing naval fleets, squadrons of planes, and ground
forces with which they want to attack Iraq?...
   As it is clear to you, our homeland is being threatened by
America and Britain and those frustrated and humiliated ones
involved with them. Our people are exposed to a grave danger. ...
   It has been decided that preventing the foreigners from
traveling outside Iraq ... will open a deep dialogue with the
peoples of those countries and those who represent them, and with
the administrations of those countries, to find a peaceful solution
and avert a catastrophe in the region, and maybe the whole world.
...
   The presence of the foreigners with the Iraqi families at vital
targets might prevent an attack. ...
   We are seeking to deter the harm of death, murder, and
starvation resulting from the U.S. policy. ... Preventing their
departure is a service to humanity. ...
   I add, ladies and gentlemen, that many of Iraq's children and
your children will become orphans, many of our women and your women
will be widowed and many of our men and your men will die if war
breaks out. ...
   To deprive an individual from seeing his homeland for some time
is better for him and for humanity as a whole than depriving
thousands of people of life. ...
   Let us cooperate to prevent these governments from committing
major crimes and force them to withdraw their troops from the
region, the presence of which may cause an intentional or
unintentional spark that will result in an inferno and
insurmountable flood of fire.
   In order to give everybody the opportunity to achieve peace; in
order to disclose and expose those who want war and destruction;
and in order to secure freedom for all, we put forward the
following initiative:
   Firstly, the Security Council, with the consent of the United
States, guarantees that U.S. forces will withdraw from the region
under a fixed timetable, and within a period not exceeding the time
it took to mobilize them.
   In addition, the Security Council reassures Saudi Arabia that it
will undertake collective military action against Iraq if it
attacks Saudi Arabia.
   At the same time, both Iraq and Saudi Arabia pledge that neither
of them will commit an act of aggression against the other or harm
the interests of the other.
   Secondly, the Security Council guarantees the security and
stability in the entire region in accordance with the general basis
contained in our previous initiative. ... This alternative, as we
see it, is the option to achieve full and comprehensive peace and
bring definite stability to the region and the world.
   Thirdly if either paragraph one or two above is accomplished,
the foreigners shall be allowed to travel immediately as they
choose.
   Fourthly, if the above is not to be fulfilled for any acceptable
reason, then we will be content with a clear, unequivocal written
commitment from the U.S. president that he withdraw his forces and
those of his allies ... in accordance with a specific timetable and
in a period that does not exceed the time to mobilize these forces;
that he pledges not to use force against Iraq; that he declares his
respect for international law and refrain from violating it; that
he breaks the economic blockade on Iraq by all sides immediately;
and that he deals with Iraq on the basis of mutual respect and
reciprocal refraining from harming the interests of either party.
   For us, when the above mentioned items are met, we will use our
constitutional powers to allow the foreigners concerned to travel
out of Iraq, each according to his wish and decision.
   Fifthly, the issue of Kuwait should be left for the Arabs to
tackle as an Arab issue, the same way they handled similar issues,
such as that of the Sahara in the Arab Maghreb region between
Morocco and the other parties concerned and the issue of Syria's
occupation of Lebanon.
   Will the deaf hear? This is a question directed to the U.S.
administration. A correct answer to this question will serve
humanity. God's peace and blessings be upon you.

<DATELINE>SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military, mindful of the toll taken
by terrorists the last time American troops were on Middle East
soil, is improving the security for its growing force in Saudi
Arabia.
   Already strict security measures have been tightened even more
in the past 72 hours, as Saudi officials expressed more concern
over the possibility of terrorist attacks, a subject U.S. military
officials refuse to discuss except in general terms.
   ``We are doing what we think is necessary to protect our people,
equipment and installations,'' one senior American officer said
here. ``But I'm not going to get into whether we feel there is more
of a threat or less of a threat or things like that.''
   A Saudi government official, however, said Saturday night that
some concerns had been raised over the possibility that Iraqi or
Iraqi-sponsored terrorists could have slipped into the Saudi
kingdom with Kuwaitis fleeing their occupied country.
   ``We essentially have been allowing free crossing of the border
and maybe at times we should have been more diligent,'' the Saudi
official said.
   The official, like others quoted here, spoke only on condition
of anonymity.
   American military officers here have, both publicly and
privately, expressed concerns that American military personnel
might be targeted for terrorist attacks as the stalemate with Iraqi
troops just over the Saudi border in Kuwait drags on.
   American diplomatic posts around the world were urged to take
security precautions in the days after President Bush committed
U.S. troops to the defense of the Saudi kingdom and its oil fields.
   When asked about strict security measures here, U.S. officials
repeatedly recall the devastating 1983 truck bombing of a Marine
barracks in Lebanon.
   ``This a very dangerous part of the world,'' one U.S. military
officer involved in security efforts said. ``History would tell us
to be vigilant.''
   Ground rules for the Pentagon pool operation prohibit disclosure
of specific security steps being taken at U.S. military positions
in Saudi Arabia. Officers also have been urging reporters not to
disclose such details because of their value to Iraq.
   Visits in the past few days to several installations have
provided glimpses of security precautions not in place during
earlier visits.
   At one Army camp, guards kept M-16s aimed at a car filled with
soldiers and journalists waiting outside a command post, even after
the car had passed a series of elaborate security checks.
   ``It might make you nervous but they're doing their job and
they're doing it right,'' the soldier driving the car said.
   The possibility of terrorism also is among reasons cited when
U.S. military officials are asked why American troops are not yet
allowed to take recreation breaks in Saudi cities. The Saudi army
on Saturday was seen stopping and searching cars on a road not far
from where some U.S. forces and equipment are deployed.
   ``It is better to take precautions than to suffer casualties,''
an adviser to the Saudi government said.
   Not that there haven't been security lapses.
   The Air Force included in one package of material it gave
reporters a handout, printed for military personnel, that listed
locations where airmen were staying and the times and pickup points
of shuttles to base areas. Several hours later, after a reporter
brought the document to the attention of military escorts,
reporters were asked to return the handout so it would not fall
into the wrong hands if discarded.
   And a Navy admiral opened a briefing this week by detailing the
number and exact location of Marines and weapons recently arrived
in Saudi Arabia, this despite specific written guidelines that such
details not be discussed.
   A television reporter at the briefing instructed his crew not to
feed that part of the tape back to the United States because it
could have been broadcast or intercepted during satellite
transmission.
   Not surprisingly, the Marines here appear most on edge about
potential security lapses.
   A shotgun-toting Marine was standing guard outside one area
where Marines are stationed, and refused to open the gate even
after speaking with two Navy officers accompanying a small group of
reporters.
   Photographers were clamoring to take a picture of a Marine tank
flying an American flag, but the Marines refused to allow the shot
because from the background it might have been possible to pinpoint
their location.
   ``They will never forget Lebanon, nor should they,'' one of the
Navy officers said. ``They have every right to be extra sensitive.''

Running Water</HEAD>

   Carol Bowyer chose to play the lottery
instead of eating lunch one day, and now her family has two used
pickups, an electric stove and, finally, running water. Soon
they'll have an indoor toilet.
   The Bowyers won $25,000 in the West Virginia Lottery in June,
and though the money was soon spent, life on their mountain in the
heart of Appalachia will never be the same.
   ``It's a dream for me,'' Mrs. Bowyer said. ``It's something I
hadn't never really counted on ever. It's a dream come true.''
   Mrs. Bowyer, 45, her husband, Walter, 46, a coal truck driver,
and three sons live in a five-room house they are still building
outside this mining community. Lightbulbs are bare and most
interior walls show bare insulation between the studs. It started
as one room.
   The house sits isolated, surrounded by sheds for chickens, goats
and tools, against dense woods a few miles south of Beckley in
southern West Virginia.
   ``I love it up here,'' she said. ``The only objection I ever had
was water. When the kids hauled the water, it's OK. But when
they're in school or something and I have to haul water, I didn't
like it.''
   The Bowyers, who occasionally had to go on welfare, had enough
money for electricity and a telephone but not for a well, which
costs about $2,000.
   Instead, the family hiked several hundred yards with buckets to
a spring just off a dirt road, where they drew water for sponge
baths. They got their cooking and drinking water from service
stations.
   ``My husband tells me I'm camping out. Seven years of camping
out. That's enough for anybody. ... We were planning on moving off
the lot,'' she said.
   Then one day in June, Mrs. Bowyer walked more than four miles to
the town of Beaver.
   ``I had a choice: I either eat or put $2 or $3 in the lottery,
and that day I decided to play the lottery,'' she said.
   One of her $1 tickets was a $25,000 winner, less $5,000 withheld
for federal income tax and $1,000 the Bowyers owed in back income
tax.
   Bowyer bought a 1986 pickup and Walter III, 17, bought himself a
1963 pickup. Billy, 15, and Michael, 11, received a stereo and a
remote control car.
   Then little was left after plumbing supplies, clothes, a few
dinners out and a used electric stove Mrs. Bowyer bought from her
mother-in-law for $50.
   So far, the Bowyers' indoor plumbing consists of just a pipe and
spigot in the eldest son's room, soon to be the bathroom. A septic
tank has been installed outside.
   ``We got water in the house so far and that's it. We've got
everything ready to hook up, but he can't take off no more work,''
Mrs. Bowyer said.
   The family moved their mobile home to the mountain in 1983 after
they couldn't afford to make monthly payments on a lot in Beckley.
Here, they pay $300 a year.
   They eventually lost the mobile home, too. That's when they
started to build, one room at a time.
   ``It was just a piece of land. This room here, we threw this
room up and all five of us lived in this room for about six
months,'' Mrs. Bowyer said as she pointed to her kitchen. ``Can you
picture five people living in one room? It was kitchen, bedroom and
everything for a while.''
   She's proud of their new, 105-foot-deep well.
   ``When he pulled that water out of here it was real pretty and
clear and I was really happy,'' she said.
   ``This is going to make me stay up here. Now I'm not ready to
leave. I'm happy. I'm content. I'll stay here until I'm old and
they have to roll me off and put me in a home.''
   She still has dreams.
   ``That money only last me about a week,'' she said. ``I've got
to win me the big lottery. That didn't last long enough.''

   Refugees fleeing occupied Kuwait say
resistance fighters are staging desperate and daring attacks
including suicide bombings, and that Iraq has been unable to wipe
them out.
   In Jordan, escaping Arabs said Kuwaitis opposed to the Iraqi
annexation have been clashing with pro-Iraqi Palestinians in
Kuwait. One refugee said dozens of people had been killed.
   The small oil-rich emirate was overrun by the powerful Iraqi
army on Aug. 2 and annexed six days later. Most communication with
the outside world has gradually been cut by the invaders.
   Refugees arriving Sunday at the Saudi Arabian border crossing of
Khafji said one Kuwaiti resistance fighter mounted a suicide car
bomb attack Friday on an Iraqi position at a hospital in the Kuwait
City suburb of Jabriyeh.
   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but the
clandestine Kuwait radio also reported it, saying an unspecified
number of Iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded.
   In an apparent reference to the same incident, the Kuwaiti
newspaper Al-Anbaa, now publishing in Cairo, said Iraqi soldiers
had been using the hospital as a headquarters.
   A similar attack Tuesday destroyed an Iraqi checkpoint near the
entrance to Kuwait's harbor, the refugees said.
   Some refugees said they witnessed a brief attack Wednesday. Four
Kuwaiti men armed with rifles fired on an Iraqi emplacement at the
town of Jeleeb Al-Shuyoukh, nine miles southwest of the capital.
   The Iraqis conterattacked with machine guns and a tank, and the
four resistance fighters took shelter in a nearby mosque. The tank
fired at least three shells into the mosque, killing one of the
attackers and injuring two. The other fled, according to the
refugees.
   One Iraqi officer was sighted Wednesday dangling by the neck
from a crane in downtown Kuwait, the refugees said, without
elaborating.
   Most resistance attacks take place under cover of darkness, the
refugees said. None could be independently confirmed.
   The guerrillas, who call their movement ``Humane Resistance,''
have also set up an informal organization to handle matters like
distribution of goods, the refugees said.
   British journalist Victor Mallet, who was in Kuwait at the time
of the invasion, said the resistance quickly developed into a
guerrilla force mounting ambushes and sniper attacks, often with
weapons taken from police stations.
   The Kuwaiti armed forces, numbering about 20,000, were quickly
overwhelmed by Iraq's tank-led assault.
   Mallet, who eventuallly escaped across the desert to Saudi
Arabia, quoted a member of the deposed ruling Al-Sabah family as
saying that the resistance was developing an underground political
and military structure and was in contact with the exiled goverment
abroad.
   ``The plan was to encourage popular defiance and demoralize
Iraqi troops already uncertain about their mission,'' Mallet, who
writes for The Financial Times, reported last week from the the
Saudi capital, Riyadh.
   One big problem for the resistance movement has been lack of
coordination. Separate groups have formed in various parts of the
country, Mallet said.
   The resistance groups are also beset by logistical problems and
lack of weaponry, he said.
   Among the non-combat tasks being carried out by the resistance
are care of the sick, the distribution of food and fuel and
guarding against profiteers, the refugees here said in interviews.
   Egyptian refugee Sameh Al-Minyawi said his wife and daughter
would travel on to Egypt, but that he himself would return to
Kuwait and join the resistance because ``this is my duty to the
country where I lived and worked seven years.''
   ``I don't care what politicians may say or do, but these Nazis
should be stopped at any cost,'' he said of the Iraqi invaders.
   The refugees described streams of Iraqis arriving in Kuwait by
car to buy televisions, radios and other appliances. Kuwait is
facing shortages of milk, sugar, rice and soap, they said.
   Electric appliances, which are scarce in Iraq, were being sold
by Iraqi troops who looted them from houses, the refugees claimed.
   They said Iraqi officials appeared on Kuwaiti television
Thursday with seven prisoners _ four Syrians, two Egyptians and a
Kuwaiti _ and announced they would be executed for looting cash and
gold from shops.
   At the Ruweishid border post in Jordan, Arabs arriving from
Kuwait described nights shattered by gunfire as Kuwaitis opposed to
the Iraqi annexation ought pro-Iraqi Palestinians.
   ``Kuwaitis are becoming very nervous and violent. They shoot and
kill other Arab civilians for no reason,'' said Mohammad Ahmad
al-Maarouf, a Tunisian merchant.
   He was one of thousands of Arabs who flooded through the desert
border post Sunday as Iraq tightened its grip on Westerners in
Kuwait and Iraq.
   A senior Jordanian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Iraqi authorities had notified Jordan's government
that at least 350,000 Arabs will be crossing through Ruweishid this
week.
   Maarouf and other evacuees said the shootouts in Kuwait followed
violent political discussions.
   Mohammed Ali, an Egyptian, said Iraqi troops were ``trying
desperately to stop the shootouts that have left tens of
Palestinians dead.''

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat's support for
Iraq has alienated him from key Arab patrons and set off a surge of
radicalism in his own ranks that he may find hard to control.
   By backing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2, Arafat cut off an important source of revenue, the oil
sheiks of the Persian Gulf.
   He also harmed relations with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
the leading Arab moderate who had championed Arafat's peace
initiative.
   Whether these developments will jeopardize his leadership of the
Palestine Liberation Organization remains to be seen.
   Arafat has survived many challenges since he took over the
movement in 1969. But with the PLO now threatened with a new schism
as well as a funding squeeze, he is in a tight corner.
   In the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians
cheer Saddam, not Arafat, in daily demonstrations against the
Americans and Saudis.
   Arafat faces a growing challenge in the territories, where a
Palestinian uprising has raged for 2{ years, from militants of the
Islamic Hamas movement.
   Hamas wants to escalate the stone-throwing riots against the
Israelis into a full-blown guerrilla war. The passions unleashed by
Saddam's actions work in their favor.
   They see Saddam's military might and willingness to challenge
the West and Israel as their best hope of liberating the occupied
lands after decades of despair and humiliation.
   In Syria, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and
the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine have called
for a resumption of the armed campaign against Israel that was
halted by the peace initiative Arafat launched in late 1988.
   They are the largest guerrilla factions in the PLO after
Arafat's Fatah group.
   In Baghdad, the Palestine Liberation Front last week called on
``progressive Arab forces to confront the invading American
aggressors.''
   The group is led by Mohammed Abbas, or Abul Abbas, the
mastermind of the Achille Lauro cruise liner hijack in October
1985, and the failed seaborne attack on Israel that led President
Bush earlier this year to break off the U.S. dialogue with the PLO.
   Arab newspapers have reported that terrorist mastermind Abu
Nidal plans to base himself in Iraq after a split with Libya, where
he has had his headquarters for the last few years.
   But PLO officials interviewed in Tunis by telephone said they
did not believe that Saddam would welcome Abu Nidal, who was based
in Baghdad for seven years in the 1970s.
   Few Palestinians were dismayed when Saddam invaded Kuwait and
touched off a potentially explosive confrontation with the the
United States. They were increasingly frustrated by the Arab
rulers' reluctance to use their oil wealth to force Israel to leave
the occupied territories.
   Saddam played the Palestinian card shrewdly by linking any
settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis to an Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank and Gaza, captured in 1967.
   He appealed to the Arab masses, over the heads of their
governments, for support for his stand against Israel and the
United States.
   He has succeeded to a large degree. Most Arabs see Washington as
Israel's main protector and have long fumed at its failure to
pressure the Jewish state into peace negotiations and a withdrawal
from the occupied lands.
   The PLO was reluctant at first to back Saddam. Arafat shuttled
between Arab capitals trying to find an ``Arab solution'' that
would prevent foreign intervention. But ``he found the leaders far
too divided to cooperate,'' said a PLO official who accompanied him.
   In recent days, PLO officials have been trying to put a better
public face on their position.
   ``The PLO will never condone the occupation of any country by
force when we ourselves are victims of such policies,'' said Salah
Khalaf, Arafat's senior aide who uses the nom de guerre of Abu Iyad.
   But in an interview, he stressed Palestinian resentment at U.S.
failure to force Israel to surrender the occupied territories after
more than two decades. By contrast, he said, when Iraq seized
Kuwait and the oil flow to the West was threatened, the United
States and its allies acted ``like lightning.''

   Tonislav Maricic and his ethnic
Croatian neighbors in this hillside village say they feel like
victims of a campaign for a greater Serbia.
   While their Serbian neighbors were voting Sunday on regional
autonomy in Knin, a city of 11,000 people a few miles down the
hill, Maricic and friends gathered over coffee and fiery brandy to
ponder their fate.
   ``We're pawns in a political game organized by (Serbian
Communist President Slobodan) Milosevic with the aim of creating a
greater Serbia,'' said Maricic, 63, a powerfully built retiree.
   While Maricic and his neighbors are among the majority in the
western Yugoslav republic of Croatia, they are the minority in the
Serbian-dominated southwest.
   The peace among residents of this Croatian village and the
surrounding Serbian villages has not yet been disturbed by the
Serbian drive for autonomy.
   But signs of tension are evident near Potkonje, this village of
60 brick homes scattered around a dirt trail built into rocky hills
near the Adriatic coast.
   One of Potkonje's handful of ethnic Serbs has taken to
irritating his neighbors by racing through the village with a
Serbian flag in the back window of his pickup truck.
   Armed men from other villages around Knin blocked roads to
prevent police from trying to stop the referendum.
   But Maricic, local head of Croatia's new center-right Croatian
Democratic Union, said it is vital for Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman to maintain a moderate policy toward the Serbian minority.
   ``The important thing is for Tudjman to keep a cool head and not
give in to provocations,'' he said.
   The Serbs should be allowed to vent their frustrations, he
added. ``It's better to let wine run out of a cask than to let it
explode.''
   He charged Serb extremists want bloodshed that could result in a
call for the Serb-dominated army to come in and restore order.
   Potkonje residents oppose the Serbian demand for autonomy and
say if it succeeds, they will seek to join a nearby Croatian county.
   They said their area, even though it is dominated now by Serbs,
is traditionally Croatian, and that Croatian King Zvonimir was
crowned nearby nine centuries ago.
   Though residents of the village do not expect trouble with their
Serbian neighbors, they have started to take precautions, forming a
village guard armed with handguns.
   Nikola Pozar, a 66-year-old former railroad worker, said, ``They
hemmed us in, but we're not afraid because we haven't done
anything. ... But if they attack, we will defend our homes with
axes and pitchforks.''

   Carrying a bicycle and a lantern he
had looted from the burning migrant worker hostel, the Xhosa man
smiled as he walked back to his ramshackle squatter camp.
   A few dozen of his comrades casually climbed through windows of
the barracks-like hostel, looking for anything of value abandoned
by Zulus who fled savage tribal fighting.
   A week earlier, thousands of Zulus had filled the concrete and
sheet-metal hostel, separated by a narrow dirt road from the
squatter camp populated mostly by Xhosas.
   A 24-year-old Xhosa man called Bennett used a large hammer to
smash a wall, block by block. He said he would tear down the entire
hostel, which spread over several acres.
   He and his fellow Xhosas said they wanted to prevent the Zulus,
their longtime foes, from ever returning.
   ``We cannot go on like this,'' said Theo, a Xhosa who gave his
age as 30. ``They took us from the taxis and killed us! We cannot
stand the pressure.''
   Police with tear gas guns occasionally rode by in armored
vehicles. The blacks scampered to their shacks, then returned when
the police were gone.
   The Zulus and squatter camp residents began fighting on Aug. 12.
The clashes sparked a week of violence in Tokoza, east of
Johannesburg, and other nearby black townships. The death toll was
more than 290.
   The fighting, mostly between war bands armed with crude spears,
machetes and clubs, had political roots but appeared to have turned
into tribal war.
   Most Zulus support the conservative Inkatha movement, while most
Xhosas are loyal to the African National Congress. Inkatha and the
ANC are the major black opposition groups opposed to the white-led
government.
   Theo, an ANC supporter, said politics fueled the violence. He
blamed Inkatha for trying to make it appear tribal-based.
   ``To make it confusing, they say they're attacking Xhosas,''
Theo said, holding a short iron bar in his hand. ``It started
Sunday, when they killed a Xhosa.''
   The Zulus then attacked the squatter camp on Monday, he said.
``They were trying several times to move us, but they couldn't make
it.''
   The Zulus left Wednesday for another hostel up the road, he said.
   At times, Zulus would stop taxis that transport blacks from the
townships to and from their jobs in Johannesburg, Theo said.
Pointing at his elbow, he said the Zulus would ask riders what it
was.
   If the rider gave the Zulu word for elbow, he was safe, Theo
said. But if he gave the Xhosa word, he was pulled out and killed.
   Bennett, tall and thin with large eyes, said he fought the Zulus
on Monday night armed with a panga, or machete. He had rough
scratches on the side of his throat.
   ``They tried to grab him,'' Theo said, putting his hand around
the younger man's neck. ``He escaped.''
   Behind him, people carried blankets, mattresses and chairs from
the Zulu hostel across the windswept brown clearing to their
shacks. One man had a stereo speaker _ but the squatter camp has no
electricity.

   It may sound like sacrilege to some,
but John Kreuger sees a booming market in kangaroo heads.
   The businessman in Townsville, on Australia's northeast coast,
is about to start stuffing 2,000 to 3,000 kangaroo heads per year
on tropies for sale to overseas tourists. They will sell for about
$40 each.
   Krueger also is advertising in U.S. magazines and hopes to
export 10,000 heads a year to the United States.
   ``Trophies are an accepted part of life overseas,'' Krueger
said. ``The visitors come here and see part of a kangaroo and want
to take it home with them. I think there's a huge market for the
heads out there.''
   Krueger has been stuffing kangaroo heads for 26 years, mostly
for the market around Townsville. Until about six years ago, a few
were sold in other areas, but protests by animal activists halted
the practice.
   ``Now the greenies are more preoccupied with the forests and the
greenhouse effect and what have you, so I figure it'll be OK,''
Krueger said. ``They'll be in Sydney shops within three to four
months.''
   Rick Humphries, national coordinator for Greenpace Australia,
said he was ``disgusted'' with Krueger's plans.

<HEAD>Courts Stay Rules to Restrict `Dial-a-Porn'</HEAD>

   Parents be warned: the government has been
frustrated again in its lengthy fight to help you keep
``dial-a-porn'' messages away from innocent young ears.
   In a continuing battle pitting free speech against the
government's right to protect kids, courts in New York and San
Francisco last week temporarily stayed federal enforcement of new
rules designed to make sure the $2 billion marketplace for phone
sex remains an adults-only business.
   Testimony in the New York court had described some of the
messages as ``re-creations of masturbation, simulated rape,
sadomasochism and group sex.'' Homosexual rights groups had said
such services were a form of safe sex in this era of the AIDS
epidemic.
   Kendall Morrison, the owner of Dial Information Services and one
of the plaintiffs in the New York case, told The New York Times
that his company received 60,000 calls a day, costing the callers
$1 on average.
   Until the courts decide on the constitutionality of the 1989 law
that mandated the most recent Federal Communications Commission
rules, enterprising kids still will be able to shock mom and dad
with a mysterious charge on the family phone bill.
   ``Parents have our full support and our full sympathy,'' FCC
Deputy General Counsel Renee Licht said in an interview last week.
``We are doing everything we possibly can to protect your children
against indecent messages.''
   But, she added, ``There isn't very much we can do until we have
a final disposition'' of the court challenges.
   Parents still can ask phone companies to block access to phone
sex services, where technically possible. But the New York judge
who stayed FCC enforcement of the new rules said only 4 percent of
New York's 4.6 million households had asked the phone company for
blocking.
   Congress and the FCC since 1983 have been trying to erect
technological barriers to ``indecent,'' for-pay phone material.
Obscene material _ of a prurient, sexual nature and without
redeeming value _ is banned outright on commercial phone, radio and
television services.
   But the courts have held that adults have a right to hear
indecency, which the FCC defines as ``patently offensive''
depictions or descriptions of sexual material.
   The courts also have said the government has a compelling public
interest in keeping indecent material away from children. The big
problem is how to do that without trampling on the free speech
rights of phone sex providers _ and the adults who want to call
them.
   In 1987, following two previous court defeats, the FCC
implemented new rules that said phone sex providers would have a
defense from prosecution for providing indecent material if they
did one of the following: required up-front credit card payment;
scrambled their messages or used access codes. The companies also
were required to ask phone companies to identify the charges on
customers' phone bills.
   Those rules were in effect for a short period until Congress,
fearing that enterprising youths still could gain access to
telephone sex messages, banned such services outright in April 1988.
   But the Supreme Court rejected the ban, saying only obscene
material could be banned.
   Congress tried again in November 1989, a few months after the
FCC fined a California company $600,000 for transmitting obscene
phone messages. The mother of a 16-year-old boy complained that her
son had placed more than 280 calls to various phone sex services in
a 2{-month period in 1987.
   The 1989 law reinstated FCC regulation of indecency. But, under
the prodding of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Congress added a new
wrinkle: phone companies, where possible, must block access to sex
message services unless a customer asks in writing to receive them.
   Dial-a-porn services immediately labeled the Helms amendment a
type of ``presubscription'' that would drive them out of business,
and they sued the government. Several local Bell phone companies
told the FCC it was not feasible to selectively block adult
services.
   Despite these challenges, the FCC readopted the 1987 rules _ and
the new ``reverse blocking'' dictum _ in June of this year.
   The rules had been scheduled to go into effect last Wednesday,
but the courts stayed them pending further study.
   The New York federal judge, Robert P. Patterson, said the law
was vague on what constituted indecency; it was not the least
restrictive means available to accomplish the government's
purposes; and it would allow prior censorship without adequate
safeguards.

   The Soviet Defense Ministry recently provided a
rare tour of Soviet army bases. Here is a report.

   ``We always eat like this,'' insisted
the crew-cut Soviet draftee, stuffing a hunk of black bread in his
mouth as he gestured at white tablecloths, artfully arranged salad
plates and hovering waiters in the ``ordinary'' soldiers' canteen.
   When a group of foreign journalists ventured out to the firing
range of this 2nd Guards Artillery base outside Leningrad, four
soldiers with their Kalashnikov rifles and their round metal
`doughboy'-style helmets snapped to attention. It was the merest
coincidence that all four were members of the Young Communist
League.
   The army did not go so far as to paint the grass green for a
rare tour to four army bases by foreign correspondents. But
soldiers had been busy painting everything else.
   Organizers obviously took inspiration from a famous Russian
field marshal, Prince Grigory Potemkin, who had fake villages
erected overnight to greet Catherine the Great as she traveled
through conquered territory.
   Still, it was a remarkable opening by the army, which for
decades considered foreign journalists to be spies. Most of the
area surrounding Moscow is still forbidden territory for
non-Soviets because they might glimpse the fence of a military base.
   On the tour, reporters and television crews were offered a mock
tank-and-helicopter battle, a session with Soviet grenade launchers
and the greasy experience of crawling inside an armored personnel
carrier and peering through tiny slits.
   Like the U.S. Army, the Soviets have discovered it is far
cheaper to train on simulators than the real thing. The
``film-trainer'' for armored personnel carrier drivers captured the
roaring and sheer difficulty of controlling one of these monsters
as they lumber off-road.
   But the simulator had limitations. Its dashboard, with clunky
meters and heavy manual buttons, looked like it belonged to the
mid-1950s, not the age of high-tech warfare.
   Crews for the big guns practiced loading lightweight empty shell
casings and pulling a string. All it lacked for theater was someone
yelling, ``Bang!''
   Draftees, stripped to the waist, lifted legs and arms in
calisthenics more reminiscent of Jane Fonda than U.S. Marines. But
their metal weights were not shiny barbells; they were worn-out
tank treads.
   Most young soldiers were tongue-tied in the face of foreign
journalists and high-ranking officers. But their shyness turned to
rampant curiosity when they learned American recruits earn $670 a
month to their 7 rubles. That's $12 per month at the very best
exchange rate.
   The tour began on the hardly typical, pre-revolutionary base of
the 2nd Guards, nestled among the splendrous gardens of the czarist
palaces outside Leningrad. It even had its own church _ a
crumbling, onion-domed beauty, boarded up so long that saplings
grew from the crenellations.
   The soldiers were reluctant to discuss the army's most serious
problems: hazing, language difficulties among recruits from Asian
republics who cannot speak Russian, and a critical shortage of
housing for Soviet troops withdrawing from Eastern Europe.
   Journalists hoping to see examples of the housing had to make do
chatting with officers' wives at the Malorita base near Brest. They
said they had no problems.
   While many units returning from Eastern Europe have nowhere to
go, their husbands' paratrooper regiment took over an SS-20 missile
base, abandoned by a larger unit under a U.S.-Soviet nuclear
weapons treaty.
   ``We were lucky. Everybody has a place to live,'' said Marina
Petrovna, a captain's wife. Soviet journalists goggled at the
wives, whose youthful looks and Hungarian fashions contrasted with
the appearance of the average Soviet woman.
   The political officers who ran the show borrowed a few tricks
from Intourist, the government tourist agency _ packing the
schedule with travel and ceremonies that left little time for
mixing with ordinary people.
   As a result, the entourage was late for Gen. Boris Gromov's news
conference and war-game show. Ten minutes into correspondents'
questions, the Hero of the Soviet Union and former Soviet commander
in Afghanistan was drowned out by his own artillery fire.
   Political officers looked on indulgently when the
correspondents, many long-time residents who have picked up the
Soviet habit of hoarding, cleared out the military shop's supply of
paratrooper T-shirts, officers' caps and army watches. The hottest
item was an army belt _ leather with a brass hammer-and-sickle
buckle _ for $2.60.

   From a helicopter, the neat
patchwork of farms fades quickly to ragged, stone-fenced cornfields
and the Sierra Madre del Sur, where a cash crop flourishes in the
craggy wilderness.
   ``Pure marijuana, all marijuana,'' said Jesus Verjes, a director
of the annual three-month government effort to destroy the crop.
   The helicopter flew over patch after patch of marijuana in
southwestern Michoacan state.
   Michoacan's border with Guerrero is shaggy with wilderness,
creased with cliffs and rimrock. There are no roads.
   It is only one of many parts of Mexico where marijuana grows,
but is popular because of the soil, climate and isolation.
   Marijuana is a richer green than surrounding foliage and a
trained spotter can pick out the ``plantios,'' or patches.
   Those in the open are sprayed from the air. If they are
shielded, police are flown in to uproot and burn the plants.
   ``We are doing it now because the marijuana is about half
grown,'' Verjes said. ``It is too young to harvest, but too late in
the year for the growers to get another crop planted. We are trying
to break the growing cycle.''
   When the marijuana season ends in three months, the Federal
Judicial Police will start their campaign against opium poppies, he
said.
   Federal police have uprooted or sprayed about 3,000 acres of
plants and confiscated 400 tons of dried marijuana so far this
year, according to government statistics.
   How much of the drug will survive the eradication programs and
get to market is nearly impossible to calculate because no
consistent figures are available on the amount of marijuana planted
or harvested each year.
   The U.S. National Narcotics Intelligence Consumer Committee,
headed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, estimates more than
42,000 tons of Mexican marijuana finds its way into the United
States each year, or about 79 percent of the country's total supply.
   Mexico has 114 planes and helicopters dedicated to drug
eradication. The United States provides about $15 million a year
for such programs.
   In a small glen on a mountainside, soldiers uprooted armloads of
yard-high plants that had been sheltered by trees, and carried them
to a bonfire.
   ``They used to plant these things in plots bigger than a hectare
(about 2{ acres), but when we started picking them out from the
air, they got smarter,'' Verjes said. ``Most plots now are much
smaller.''
   He said the plants were ``criollo,'' or market-grade, which grow
easily and quickly and are fairly easy to spot from the air.
   Verjes said the low-bush cola de borrego, or ``sheep's tail,''
produces a more potent leaf, brings a better price and is easier to
hide among other vegetation, but the yield is lower and it needs
some special growing conditions.
   ``If we spot an area from the air that has maybe five plots, we
send in police and usually find 15 or 20 other plots hidden away
nearby,'' he said.
   Growers have taken to planting corn, giving it a start, then
planting marijuana among it, giving an appearance from above of an
innocent cornfield.
   If nobody lives nearby or there is a shack that appears
abandoned, police often are sent in for a closer look.
   ``They have gotten smarter, but so have we,'' Verjes said.
   Police in helicopters had descended the day before on the camp
used by workers tending the plants that were being burned. The 20
or so men had escaped quickly, abandoning hot food on the fire.
   There were seeding beds for starting the plants, a drying rack
and enough rice, beans, sugar, tortilla flour and other supplies to
last for weeks, possibly months.
   A pot of beans was on the dead fire of the camp, about 140 miles
southwest of Mexico City. Clothes were scattered among crude bamboo
beds on a dirt floor.
   If the crop had survived, Verjes said, it would have been
compressed into bricks and taken to a buyer by burro. He said bus
ticket stubs in the shelter indicated most of the workers were not
from Michoacan, but had come from other poor agricultural states.
   Drug camps are heavily armed and 17 federal police assigned to
drug eradication have been killed so far this year, usually at the
outset of raids.
   Most of the plants in this plantio had been laid out in neat
rows, perhaps from years of habit, making them easier to spot in
the tangle of trees and bushes.
   The patches were scattered over about 40 acres, providing about
five days' work for the men uprooting the marijuana, said Hector
Salinas Almaguer, a lawyer and police agent who led the detail.
   ``From here, they will go down the mountain to some other
patches we have found from the air,'' he said.
   Michoacan's isolation closed in. Aside from the fire's crackle
and the tramp of boots, the only sounds were crickets, mosquitoes
and the rustling of leaves in a light breeze.

   An Army deserter who spent 30 years in East
Germany and was arrested when he returned home was reunited Sunday
with the ex-wife and daughters he left behind.
   Arnold Kephart and about a dozen friends and relatives greeted
his former wife, Brigitte, 30, and the couple's twin 9-year-old
daughters, Karoline and Katharine, at Eppley Airfield late Sunday
night. The reunion was delayed more than five hours because they
missed a connecting flight.
   As Kephart and Brigitte hugged and kissed each other, the girls
were given bouquets of flowers. Kephart's niece, Debbie Rolfe of
nearby Council Bluffs, Iowa, gave the twins toy dolls.
   Brigitte and the twins are supposed to return to East Germany
Sept. 9, but Kephart said he'll try to change that.
   ``We want her to stay. He needs a mother,'' he said, gesturing
toward Frankie, Arnold and Brigitte's 13-year-old son who
accompanied his father to this country earlier this year.
   Kephart and Brigitte were married in 1976 and divorced in 1988.
They had been working on a reconciliation when Kephart left East
Germany. He said Sunday he hopes they can remarry.
   Kephart, 53, was a U.S. Army private in West Germany in 1959
when he wrecked a Jeep and fled to East Germany because he feared
punishment.
   Kephart remained for three decades in East Germany.
   He and Frankie were permitted to leave after the country's
hard-line Communist government fell last fall after massive
pro-democracy demonstrations forced officials to open the borders
to the West.
   They returned to the United States in January. Kephart was
arrested for desertion as soon as he stepped off the plane in
Omaha. A week later, the Army granted him a discharge and he
rejoined his relatives in Council Bluffs.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is seeking
increased international support for the U.S. naval barricade of
Iraqi shipping, as one key Persian Gulf state offers to host
``friendly'' forces on its territory.
   Cheney planned to leave this island nation today after
conferring with its emir, Sheik Isa Al-Khalifa. He was to travel on
to other friendly Arab nations in the Persian Gulf before returning
to Saudi Arabia.
   One stop on his itinerary was the United Arab Emirates, which
announced Sunday it has agreed to the deployment of Arab and
``friendly'' forces on its territory to help defend the Persian
Gulf region.
   Diplomatic sources in Abu Dhabi said the announcement approved
the deployment of U.S., Egyptian and Pakistani troops, but it was
not immediately known if any of those nations planned to send
forces.
   ``The United Arab Emirates has agreed to receive some Arab and
friendly forces as a contribution to the Arab and international
efforts being exerted to defend the region,'' said the Foreign
Ministry statement released by the United Arab Emirates' official
news agency. The statement did not name any countries or say how
many forces would be involved.
   Cheney also was scheduled to visit Oman today before heading to
Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
   During a stop Sunday on the command ship of the U.S. naval task
force in the Persian Gulf, Cheney vowed the United States would
continue its effort to cripple Iraq's international commerce and
use force if necessary. The ship was docked in Bahrain.
   He spoke as U.S. warships shadowed two Iraqi oil tankers after
the vessels ignored U.S. warning shots Saturday and headed out of
the gulf region.
   The shots were the first fired in an interdiction effort ordered
by President Bush to halt goods leaving and entering Iraq. The
United Nations previously ordered a trade embargo against Iraq
involving all goods except food and medical shipments.
   ``Our forces are authorized to intercept shipping that they have
reason to believe may in fact be violating the sanctions,'' Cheney
told reporters traveling with him.
   ``We want to continue to work both by voluntary means and by
naval means, if necessary, to see to it that the sanctions are
enforced,'' he said.
   The Iraqi News Agency said Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on
Sunday called the U.S. shipping interdiction effort ``piracy and
armed aggression'' and asked the international community to condemn
it.
   Cheney would not speculate on any steps that might be taken
against Iraqi tankers if they continued to refuse to stop.
   ``I wouldn't want to speculate on what happens next,'' he said.
``We obviously are prepared to see to it that the sanctions that
the United Nations voted and the action that the legitimate
government of Kuwait asked us to take are carried out.''
   An administration official said the United States intended to go
forward with its interdiction effort, even though no further action
has been taken against the two Iraqi tankers.
   ``There's nothing pushing immediate action here,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We've stated our
intent and many people are complying voluntarily.''
   The official said the administration is looking toward further
action in the United Nations on enforcement of its sanctions.
   The U.N. Security Council unanimously demanded Saturday that
Iraq let all foreigners leave and that Baghdad ``take no action to
jeopardize the safety, security or health of such nationals.''
   Cheney refused to tie the outbreak of shooting in the area's
tense waters to Iraq's refusal to allow more than 3,000 Americans
and thousands of other Westerners to leave that nation or Kuwait,
the tiny oil-rich kingdom that Iraq overran on Aug. 2.
   Cheney insisted ``the two are unrelated.''
   On Sunday, Cheney was in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, where he
inspected U.S. troops at a desert air base.
   The United States is building forces in Saudi Arabia to deter an
Iraqi invasion of the United States' largest supplier of oil.
   ``Should Saddam Hussein be foolish enough to launch an attack on
Saudi Arabia, (American forces) would be able to do a very
effective job of making him pay us a bit of a price for that,''
Cheney told reporters at the base.
   As U.S. and Saudi F-15 fighter jets screamed overhead, he viewed
the mass of U.S. military equipment lined along one runway, visited
with members of a Sheridan tank unit and was taken to a Patriot
missile battery dug into the desert on the outskirts of the air
base.

   The local branch of the Riyadh Bank is closed, big American-made
sedans are parked willy-nilly, and Saudi customs agents are
underemployed these days.
   In fact, the only people passing through this checkpoint are
refugees who have fled Kuwait.
   To them, the Red Cross tents several hundred yards down the road
and the Al Khafji Hotel, six miles away in the small oil town of
Khafji, are oases.
   ``We're very crowded, very crowded,'' said Mursi Abu Bakr, whose
family owns the hotel that fronts on the Persian Gulf with a view
of some of the richest oil fields in the world.
   Abu Bakr said Kuwaitis _ desperate to stay near the border _
have filled his hotel since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Some refugees like Kuwaiti air force Capt. Mohamed Al-Ajmi, 32,
want to stay near the border so they can keep in contact with their
families by car phone. Regular telephone lines have been cut so car
phones must be used, he said.
   From his reports, Al-Ajmi said resistance by Kuwaitis to the
Iraqi occupation is intensifying.
   Refugees arriving Sunday at the Khafji border crossing said one
Kuwaiti resistance fighter mounted a suicide car bomb attack Friday
on an Iraqi position at a hospital in the Kuwait City suburb of
Jabriyeh.
   The attack could not be independently confirmed, but the
clandestine Kuwait radio also reported it, saying an unspecified
number of Iraqi soldiers were killed or wounded.
   Despite its proximity to the border, there are few signs that
people in Khafji are worried about an Iraqi attack.
   Iraqi troops have dug in about 25 miles from the border,
according to a Saudi official, and they are not visible.
   Khalid Al-Otaishan, the governor of the Khafji area, said Saudi
troops were stationed nearby in the desert, but few could be seen
in the city which resembled a ghost town as people sought relief
from the intense mid-day sun.
   Saudi officials have said their goal is to keep troops out of
the public eye to allow life to continue as normally as possible.
   Saudi tank carriers traveled along the paved road to Dhahran _
headquarters of the U.S. military operation, about 220 miles to the
south.
   Handfuls of Saudi soldiers prayed alongside the road in
accordance with Moslem ritual as goats and camels wandered nearby
in the desert.
   Only one group of American soldiers was spotted during the day _
seven Army men sat in a parked station wagon at the border
checkpoint.
   Al-Otaishan, 41, who was educated at the University of Southern
California, said people are less worried than they were immediately
after Iraqi troops occupied Kuwait.
   Some of the few hundred Khafji residents who fled in panic have
come back because they think the situation has stablized, he said.
   Six Saudi tanks were parked in the desert several hundred yards
from the building where the governor was interviewed.
   Abu Bakr, the hotelier, agreed people felt safer in part because
of the presence of U.S. troops and warships.
   Asked if he was scared, he said: ``The first week we were. Now
things are getting better and we work the best we can.''
   Scott Scheid of Newport Beach, Calif., said Khafji was probably
not the best place to be.
   ``I don't think you want to be here if something starts up,''
said Scheid, who works for an American oil company near Dhahran.
   Scheid's company has evacuated its 19 local employees from
Khafji.
   ``There is a lot of tension in the air,'' said a co-worker,
Albert Skiba, of Tucson, Ariz.
   The soul of Khafji is the Arabian Oil Co., which pumps about
300,000 barrels a day and dominates the area with its refinery and
oil tank facilities. The company is 40 percent owned by the
Japanese, with the Saudis and the Kuwaitis sharing the remainder.

<HEAD>U.S. Exports Growing, Commerce Secretary Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regardless of the Middle East's impact on the
world's oil bill, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher believes
U.S. exports will continue to grow and keep the nation's economy
out of recession this year.
   But he admitted in an interview that rising oil costs could ruin
his prediction that the nation's merchandise trade deficit will
come in under $100 billion this year for the first time since 1983.
   Mosbacher commented in his fifth floor office following his
department's announcement Friday that exports in June reached a
record $34.3 billion and helped drive the trade deficit that month
to just $5.07 billion.
   That was the slimmest imbalance since the deficit dropped to
$3.96 billion in June 1983.
   Assuming oil prices decline soon, he said, ``we're headed at
close to a $90 billion trade deficit this year _ it could be $95
billion, under $100 billion is what I've been saying.''
   That would be more than a one-third cut from the 1987 peak
deficit of $152.12 billion. The imbalance has declined each year
since then, falling to $109 billion last year.
   So far this year, Mosbacher said, the deficit has tumbled to
$45.8 billion, the lowest six-month imbalance since the second half
of 1983.
   But he admitted that continued high oil prices could add to the
cost of imports which dropped to $39.37 billion in June and helped
narrow the deficit.
   ``If the price of oil doesn't stay up very long, we'll still
make it,'' he said. The price of oil on Friday was nearly twice the
$14.64 a barrel that it averaged during June.
   Many analysts have said they believe skyrocketing oil prices
will add to the cost of imports in the second half of the year,
offsetting the effect of export growth on the deficit.
   The secretary contended that ``the price of oil is not as big
relatively overseas as it is here'' and will not substantially cut
into purchases of U.S. goods.
   ``So, I think we'll continue to have a good market,'' he said.
``You know, we're now in a trade surplus with Europe and I think
we'll hold that.''
   The surplus with Europe totaled $806.2 million in June, pushing
the six-month total to $4.34 billion. At the same time, the deficit
with Japan _ as usual, the biggest _ fell from $24.42 billion in
the first half of 1989 to $19.59 billion from January through June
of this year.
   ``We've had some real improvement'' with Japan, Mosbacher said.
``We're down from almost $50 billion last year to what looks like
$40 billion this year, plus or minus.''
   The commerce secretary attributed the export progress to the
decline in the dollar, improved quality of U.S. goods and greater
export expertise.
   ``U.S. goods are a lot cheaper overseas now for these
customers,'' he said. ``Plus, our quality keeps improving and our
knowledge of how to export ... keeps improving. And finally, the
government's working with exporters.''
   Thus far, he said, the rising exports ``shows American business
is competitive around the world, it shows American business is
beginning to realize it's a global marketplace, with the biggest
potential area of growth and unsatisfied demand outside the U.S.''

<HEAD>Hubble Mirror Maker Building More NASA Mirrors; Backlash Feared</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The company responsible for the Hubble
Space Telescope's flawed mirror is building mirrors for another
NASA observatory, a $1.4 billion instrument that will ``see''
X-rays from the cosmos.
   Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., formerly Perkin-Elmer, has
said it is confident it can provide quality mirrors for the
Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, or AXAF.
   ``Based on technical considerations ... there's no reason
whatsoever that the Hubble problems should have anything to do with
AXAF,'' said Charles Pellerin Jr., NASA director of astrophysics.
   Even though the two space-based telescopes are worlds apart
scientifically and have different optical systems, scientists fear
the furor on Capitol Hill over the Hubble error may spread to the
AXAF.
   ``The biggest concern is the negative reaction and the resulting
delay in funding,'' said Stephen Murray of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics, a principal investigator for the X-ray
telescope.
   The $1.5 billion Hubble was released from the shuttle Discovery
in April to study stars almost as old as the universe. Two months
later, embarrassed NASA officials reported Hubble's images were
blurry and that its use would be limited until space-walking
astronauts can install a new camera in 1993.
   A spacing error of 1.3 millimeters has been found in a measuring
instrument used by Perkin-Elmer to grind the mirrors. NASA
officials said Thursday thin washers in the device could have
caused the error if improperly installed.
   Hughes Danbury is using a different polishing method for the
X-ray mirrors because of their cylindrical shape, said company
spokesman Tom Arconti. Hubble's mirrors were like saucers and built
to reflect visible and ultraviolet light.
   ``It's a whole different set of challenges,'' Arconti said.
   The telescope will study sources of cosmic X-rays, including
quasars, black holes and supernova remnants, to help scientists
learn the size and age of the universe. Cosmic X-rays do not
penetrate the atmosphere and can't be seen from Earth.
   The telescope is scheduled for a shuttle ride in 1997, and work
is on schedule. The mirrors are expected to undergo rigorous
testing at NASA.
   Still, there is no guarantee something won't go wrong, said NASA
project scientist Martin Weisskopf. ``It has been our experience
... you put something up, it's a miracle if everything works
perfectly,'' he said. ``You have to take risks.''
   More than a third of the $145 million spent so far on AXAF has
gone toward optics, said Fred Wojtalik, project manager for Hubble
and AXAF. NASA is requesting $146 million from Congress for the
upcoming fiscal year, $63 million of that for optics.
   In another botched project, mirrors for a $747 million series of
weather satellites being built under NASA supervision have been
found to warp in the temperature extremes of space. But agency
officials said the problem has nothing to do with Hubble or AXAF.
   ITT Aerospace Communications Division supplied an inaccurate
design to mirror maker Applied Optics Corp. of Sarasota, Fla., said
ITT spokesman Donald Walters.
   Former NASA historian Alex Roland said such problems are
examples of the space agency's budget-based decision making.
   ``There are supposed to be quality control safeguards built into
that system, and my suspicion is some of those steps get cut out,''
said Roland, now a history professor at Duke University.
   ``NASA has an unrealistic agenda, and it's cutting corners on
all its programs. The chances of repeating the problems we've had
with Hubble are very high.''
   AXAF will be the third in the Great Observatories series.
Rounding out the planned fleet are the Gamma Ray Observatory and
the Space Infrared Telescope Facility.
   The $550 million, mirrorless Gamma Ray Observatory is scheduled
to be deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in the spring. The
infrared telescope is still in the early planning stages, with
launch targeted for 1999 or 2000.
   ``It would be terrible if the perceptions of the moment hurt the
visions of the future,'' said NASA administrator Richard Truly.

<HEAD>U.S., Australian Cattle Producers Vie for Japanese Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle producers in Australia and the United
States are headed for a showdown at the old corral over who's going
to be top gun in the lucrative Japanese beef market.
   Australia, traditionally a producer of grass-fattened cattle,
has dominated the limited Japanese beef market. But recent trade
liberalization has brought greater access and prospects of further
growth.
   The United States, with its vast cattle herds and experience in
producing grain-fed cattle, also has enjoyed sharp growth in sales
to Japan.
   In 1983, for example, Australia supplied 37,505 metric tons of
beef to Japan, while U.S. shipments were only 1,231 tons. By 1986,
when the Australian shipments rose to 43,987 tons, the U.S. beef
sales increased to 2,213 tons.
   But the Agriculture Department says that last year, following
Japan's beef trade agreement in 1988, Australia's share was 93,693
tons and the U.S. total was 22,807 tons.
   Meanwhile, according to a report by the department's Economic
Research Service, Australia has stepped up its own capacity to
produce grain-fed cattle to compete in the emerging Japanese demand
for top-quality beef.
   At once, Australia has served notice that it will not be content
to continue providing Japan with lower-quality beef from
grass-fattened cattle while U.S. feedlot operators walk off with
the more expensive prizes.
   The Australian cattle feedlot industry for producing
grain-fattened cattle is less than 10 percent the size of the U.S.
giant. But it's an important competitor.
   ``It is large enough to have an impact on the grain-fed beef
trade today and a greater impact in the future if present industry
expansion plans materialize,'' the report said.
   ``Australia has all the resources needed to be a strong
competitor in the grain-fed beef market in Japan and in other
countries importing grain-fed beef.''
   The agency's report was written by economists William D. Gorman
of New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, and Hiroshi Mori of
Senshu University, Kawasaki, Japan.
   Australia began a small-scale feedlot industry in the 1960s, but
the expansion ended in 1974 when cattle prices plummeted and the
Japanese market was closed, the report said. A number of those
early feedlots were built with Japanese capital.
   ``This early foray into (feedlot) cattle on a large scale ended
in disaster _ not because Australia didn't have the cattle, feed
grains and technical knowledge to make it work, but because
Australia did not have a market for grain-fed cattle,'' the report
said.
   As of early 1990, Australian feedlots had a one-time capacity of
approximately 600,000 head, and plans call for expanding to at
least 1 million head by 1992. Japanese investment once again is
part of the scene.
   Australia produces large quantities of feed-quality wheat and
barley, and smaller amounts of sorghum and corn, the report said.
And the country has the capacity to boost production if demand
increases.
   One of the factors in lining up the Japanese beef trade is ``an
unbelievably wide range'' in the beef quality offered to consumers,
the report said.
   At the top of the Japanese quality list of beef cattle is Waygu,
the domestic beef breed, which may be three or four years old at
the time of slaughter. They may have been fed on grain for as long
as 36 months.
   Special imported ``long-grain-fed'' beef is from Australian and
U.S. cattle two to three years old at slaughter. These were fed
grain for 10 to 13 months.
   Next in line are the U.S. choice and prime grades of beef from
cattle 1{ to 2 years old that have been fed grain for four to eight
months. This is the top-of-the-line beef most commonly available to
American consumers.
   Below these qualities are several grades of Australian beef that
has been produced on grass or grain, or combinations thereof.
   ``Marbling (streaks of fat) and related characteristics are very
important factors in Japanese beef quality,'' the report said. ``In
general, the greater the marbling, the higher the price.''
   The report noted that the current Japanese system of controlling
imports through quotas will be eliminated as of April 1, 1991, when
a new tariff system goes into effect.
   At that point, the current U.S. practice of shipping quality
beef to Japan by air freight, a much more expensive method than by
ocean freight used by Australia, will run into problems.
   The tariff for beef imported by Japan will rise next April 1 to
75 percent from the current 25 percent. The tariff is scheduled to
drop to 60 percent in 1992 and 50 percent in 1993.
   Air freight to Japan typically ranges from 70 cents to 90 cents
per pound, compared with 17 cents to 20 cents for ocean freight.
   ``It will probably not be financially practical to continue air
freighting most beef products after the new tariff rates take
effect,'' the report said. ``Hence, the U.S. beef packing industry
must be able to ship fresh chilled beef by ocean freight to remain
competitive with Australia.''

<HEAD>22 Drug Suspects Extradited During First Year of New Policy</HEAD>

   A year after Colombia resurrected extradition
as a weapon in his country's fight against drug traffickers, the
South American government has sent 22 people to the United States
for trial.
   Although none of them were on the 12 ``most wanted'' list, most
who have stood trial have been convicted and sentenced _ albeit it
not to particularly long prison terms.
   Only one has received the maximum 30-year prison term allowed by
the extradition decree issued last August by Colombia's
then-President Virgilio Barco.
   Of the 22, three were convicted of U.S. charges, eight pleaded
guilty and one was acquitted. Ten still await trial.
   It was the Aug. 18, 1989 assassination by traffickers of
Colombian presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken
foe of the drug trade, that spurred Barco to crack down on the
traffickers.
   Barco's state of siege included resumption of extraditions, even
though the Colombian Supreme Court had tossed out the extradition
treaty several years earlier as its members faced threats from drug
traffickers.
   John Walters, chief of staff to U.S. drug control policy
director William Bennett, said in a recent interview that the
extradition policy ``allowed an opportunity to bring to justice
people who might not have been brought to justice otherwise given
the disruption of the judicial system (in Colombia) that had
occurred as a result of trafficker violence and intimidation.''
   The Medellin drug cartel's leaders, whose missives to the
Colombian government have been signed, ``The Extraditables,''
recently said they will maintain a cease-fire they declared in July
despite the killing of one of the cartel members earlier this month
in a shootout with authorities.
   It is believed they want to convince newly inaugurated Colombian
President Cesar Gaviria to stop the extraditions.
   In his inaugural address, Gaviria swore he would make no
concessions to the traffickers, although he said extradition cannot
be the only weapon used.
   Fifteen people are awaiting extradition. The most recent
extraditions occurred Aug. 3, a few days before Gaviria took office.
   The only person extradited who has gotten the maximum 30-year
sentence is Jose Rafael Abello Silva, a reputed high-ranking member
of the Medellin cartel.
   Abello was convicted in Tulsa, Okla., of two counts of
conspiring to import cocaine and marijuana into the United States
over a seven-year period. He was sentenced to two concurrent
30-year prison terms and fined $5 million.
   Barco's 1989 decree said no Colombian national could be
extradited unless the requesting state guaranteed it would not
impose a prison sentence exceeding 30 years, eliminating the
possibility of life terms or death penalties allowable under some
U.S. laws.
   Several other Colombians have received 15-year terms:
   _Bernardo Pelaez Roldan, convicted in absentia in 1984 in
Detroit on a charge of conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine.
   _Guillermo Juan Bueno-Delgado, also known as Willy Bueno,
pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, one in San Francisco
and one in Tallahassee, Fla. His two 15-year terms are to run
concurrently.
   _Victor Eduardo Mero-Mosquero, convicted in absentia in the
early 1980s on a drug conspiracy charge in New York. He also faces
a cocaine conspiracy charge in Florida, but he is fighting
extradition.
   Of the other defendants sentenced: one got 12{ years in prison,
one got eight, one got seven and two got three years each.
   Nelson Cuevas Ramirez was acquitted in New York City of a charge
of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   Ten others await trial including the first person extradited,
Eduardo Martinez Romero, who arrived in the United States last
Sept. 6. He faces federal charges in Atlanta of conspiracy to
possess cocaine with intent to distribute and conspiracy to launder
proceeds of drug trafficking, part of an immense money-laundering
arrangement uncovered by the government's Operation Polar Cap.

   Here's your chance to be the first person on
Earth to spot the new moon when it makes its appearance Tuesday
night. Your efforts won't be on a par with the discovery of a new
planet, but it will help science all the same.
   Scientists know the position of the moon at any given time
precisely enough to send six spaceships across 250,000 miles of
space and land on the exact lunar spot they chose.
   But they can't predict the exact time or geographic location at
which the young crescent moon will first be spotted. And that's
where you come in.
   The U.S. Naval Observatory asks participants in the Moonwatch to
be outside where there's a clear, flat western horizon and to watch
from about a half hour to an hour after sunset.
   ``Please do not use binoculars or telescope,'' the observatory
says. ``A good horizon is essential since the moon will be best
visible when it is roughly 2 degrees to 5 degrees above the true
horizon.''
   Astronomers will compare the Moonwatch observations with their
theoretical calculations to improve their ability to predict the
time and location when the moon first becomes visible.
   Write to the observatory at 34th and Massachusetts Ave. NW,
Washington, D.C. 20392, about what you saw and when you saw it. A
sketch showing the position of the crescent with respect to the
horizon will be welcome, the observatory says.
   The Naval Observatory had a Moonwatch in 1988 and got
information from more than 2,000 observers, ranging in age from 4
to 92 years. Some groups turned the occasion into family outings.
Their findings were published in the magazine Sky and Telescope.
   Be warned. The new moon usually does not appear until the second
evening but it can be visible under certain conditions.
   There are no prizes, but poets through the ages have praised the
benefits of being showered by moonbeams.
   ``The moon is nothing but a circumambulatory aphrodisiac
divinely subsidized to provoke the world into a rising birthrate,''
wrote Christopher Fry.
   The Naval Observatory didn't wax that poetic. It offered only
this hope: ``May your sky be clear!''

<HEAD>Quebec Resort Town Shaken By Armed Standoff With Mohawks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This resort town nestled between pine forests
and the St. Lawrence River has been turned into an armed camp, and
it may take a long time for the wounds to heal from the standoff
between Mohawks and police.
   The lives of almost everyone here have been changed by the July
11 shootout between Mohawks from the adjacent Kanesatake reserve
and provincial police, who stormed barricades set up by the Indians.
   One policeman was killed, although it is unclear which side
fired the fatal shot.
   The Mohawks were protesting the village's plan to expand its
nine-hole golf course onto land the Indians claim contains a sacred
burial ground.
   Villagers saw their peaceful existence explode that day.
Property values have plummeted, incomes have dropped and trust
between Mohawks and the mostly French Canadian local residents has
evaporated.
   Now this community of 1,800 _ a summer tourist resort and
retirement home for many in the Montreal area _ has been turned
into a police camp.
   Two-thirds of the people have fled their homes, either living
with relatives or in hotels in the region, while awaiting the
outcome of negotiations between the Mohawks and federal and
provincial officials.
   ``I think there will be long-term (psychological) effects,''
said Louis Bricault, a psychologist hired by the municipality to
help residents deal with their problems.
   ``They are suffering from feelings of anxiety, unhappiness,
hostility, impotence and defeat. There are some people for whom
these reactions have become very intense.''
   Even when the crisis is over, it is unlikely life can ever be
the same.
   ``We have to find a way to live together,'' said Yvan Patry,
mayor of Oka Parish, the larger community that surrounds both Oka
village and the Kanesatake reserve.
   Patry said the problem must be solved because the Mohawks are
not going to leave Oka, and neither are the non-Indians.
   ``My greatest wish is that it returns to the way it was before.
We were here together before, we'll be here together afterward.''
   The economic losses have yet to be calculated. There are small
businessmen like variety store owner R. Lauzon, who will be stuck
with his summer stock, laid in for the usual influx of tourists.
   He looked at a rack full of unsold fishing poles. ``I'm friends
with everybody, but I'm still losing one-third of my business.
There are others who are worse off, some with 50-75 percent
losses.''
   One of those is Michel Beaulnes, proprietor of the highly rated
Clementine restaurant, which has shut down completely. The troubles
drove away his upscale Montreal clientele, who once flocked to the
riverfront restaurant for stuffed rabbit back, sweetbreads in port
sauce or pheasant breast with black current sauce.
   Oka feels like a ghost town, not deserted but too quiet. With
negotiations in progress between the Mohawks and the provincial and
federal governments, an uneasy calm has returned.
   On the barricades, an old man and two young cohorts sat in a
pickup truck, guarding the hilltop Mohawk barrier. The
military-type bunkers to the side appeared unmanned.
   Below, only three squad cars were at the police barricade. But
police are omnipresent everywhere else. Every third vehicle is a
police car, snack bars are full of uniformed men gnawing on hot
dogs and the cheese-french fries concoction known as poutine.
   Patry blames the problems here on a combination of Kanasatake
Mohawks who are unable to solve their leadership problems and the
federal government whose attempts at negotiation have been less
than serious.
   The golf course problem is solved. The federal government
announced it would buy the land and turn it over to the Indians.
But the matter of Indian land claims goes far beyond Oka.
   ``Are we trying to solve the problems of Alberta and Manitoba
here?'' Patry asked. ``It's sad it all had to happen here, in this
peaceful little town.''
   ``People are angry at the Mohawks, but it's not the Mohawks,
it's the Warriors,'' said resident Isidore Arsonault, referring to
the militant Warrior Society.
   Arsonault, however, said he was hopeful that ``in one week it
will be over.''
   Minutes after he made his prediction, a car with two Indians in
it approached the barricade.
   ``Go back where you belong,'' shouted one angry man, thumping on
the hood and waving his half-empty beer bottle. ``Do you speak
French? You don't even speak French. Get out of here.''
   He did not find much support among 100 people at the scene, but
neither did he receive condemnation.

   President Bush's naval barricade of Iraq, in
response to that country's invasion of Kuwait, has gone
multilingual.
   The shotgun-toting U.S. sailors who have been specially trained
to board ships heading to and from Iraq have been issued more than
radios, guns and grappling hooks.
   They also carry laminated yellow cards in French, Arabic and
English.
   Besides telling crews that their ships are being inspected for
cargo intended for Iraq or Kuwait, the cards tell them: ``Remain
calm; avoid confrontation. ... If fighting starts in your area,
drop to the deck with your hands outstretched and remain silent.
... Follow all instructions. You will be taken to a safe place.
Cooperate and no harm will come to you.''

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was flown from the carrier
Eisenhower in the Red Sea to the destroyer USS Scott, which had
just come off interdiction duty near the mouth of the Gulf of
Aqaba. He was ushered into the wood-paneled stateroom that usually
serves as the commanding officer's suite but had been transformed
into the ship's ``war room.''
   The officers papered the wall with shipping charts of the Red
Sea and Persian Gulf, filling the map's waterways with small slips
of paper indicating U.S. warships' positions.
   U.S. ground troops were marked with red dots. The northeastern
region of Saudi Arabia _ a possible Iraqi invasion route into the
Saudi oil fields _ had been transformed into a near-solid glob of
red.

   Below decks on the USS Scott, the defense secretary made a point
of spending some time with the cooks, machine toolers and engineers
who made the ship both a home and a finely tuned war machine.
   As the secretary walked through the narrow corridors, a few
adventurous sailors came forward and asked that their pictures be
taken with them. Cheney, wearing a navy blue USS Scott cap, eagerly
complied over and over.
   One sailor had a particular mission, because he and the defense
secretary had names that are pronounced alike, even though they are
spelled differently.
   Cheney chatted with the food service worker for a time, shook
his hand and then autographed a photo of the ship. Asked what the
secretary scribbled, the seaman broke out in a big smile and
replied, ``He wrote, `Good Luck.' And boy, that's the right thing
to wish us now.''

   The Scott's captain, Cmdr. Tom Corcoran, said the first alert
for the vessel to get from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea led to
a frenzy of activity, of loading supplies and fuel on his guided
missile destroyer and transferring missiles at sea from the
Eisenhower.
   Other officers on board the ship reported that Corcoran remained
at his post on the bridge guiding the rush of activity for 18 hours
straight.
   ``We've had the most incredible ten days of my life,'' the
commander said. ``Everyone's responded and nobody's tired.''
   Upon hearing that, a lieutenant and several sailors standing
behind the commander broke out in loud guffaws, and Corcoran
sheepishly joined in.

   The men of the Eisenhower battle group had begun to think they'd
be home soon, since their six months at sea were nearly up. They'd
even begun writing letters to their wives and families that they'd
be back in their home port of Norfolk, Va., in early September. But
as it often does, trouble intervened.
   ``I last talked with my wife on Aug. 5, when I thought I'd be
home in September,'' said Lt.j.g. Paul Drennan, a propulsion
officer on the Scott. ``The next day, we were heading into the Red
Sea, and I don't know when I'll talk to her _ let alone see her _
now.''

   Cheney's visit to combat troops at a windswept and sweltering
air base in Saudi Arabia posed a particularly interesting problem
for defense specialists.
   As Cheney moved swiftly from camouflaged tent to tank to command
center, several dozen reporters, television cameramen and
photographers raced after him, jumping over tent wires, ammunition
boxes _ anything and everyone, no matter how lethally armed _ in
their attempt to glean a word or picture of the secretary's visit
with the troops.
   It took some time before the military officers restored any
semblance of order, leaving the impression that defending Cheney
from the queries of news-hungry journalists might be akin to
defending Saudi Arabia from Iraq.

<HEAD>Midwest Corn a Candidate to Replace Middle East Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midwest corn fields are getting a chance
to pinch hit for Middle East oil fields.
   The U.S. Energy Department has recommended stepped-up production
of ethanol, a corn-based moonshine that is blended with gasoline to
make cleaner-burning gasohol.
   The call for more ethanol is part of a scramble to ease the loss
of Middle East oil arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this
month. Gasohol is approved for use in most vehicles, and proponents
say its time has come.
   ``There's no question in my mind it's the logical thing to do,''
said Wayne Ryan, who raises corn near Wapello, in southeastern Iowa.
   Since ethanol was introduced in 1978, more than 800 million
miles have been traveled using ethanol blends, according to the
Iowa Corn Promotion Board. Gasohol is 10 percent ethanol.
   ``Every year there's a new crop, but every time you take a
barrel of oil out of a domestic oil well it is closer to running
dry,'' said Marty Andreas, a vice president at
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM of Decatur, Ill., the nation's
largest ethanol processor.
   A bushel of corn produces about 2{ gallons of ethanol. Last
year, about 1 billion gallons of ethanol were produced nationwide
from more than 360 million bushels of corn.
   The government estimates U.S. farmers will harvest 7.85 billion
bushels of corn this fall. One out of every five bushels will come
from Iowa, the nation's leading corn producer.
   ``It's renewable, it's domestic and ethanol is benign,'' Andreas
said.
   He said the Energy Department on Wednesday asked ethanol
industry officials how much idle capacity could be brought into
production and was told that an additional 150 million to 175
million gallons could be produced each year.
   Despite the increase in gasohol interest, some warn that ethanol
cannot shoulder the nation's fuel burden.
   The 1 billion gallons of ethanol produced last year compares
with 115 billion gallons of gasoline consumed in the United States,
said David Zinanon, vice president of Petroleum Industries Research
Associates, a New York consulting firm.
   Even if ethanol production rises substantially in the years
ahead, it will remain only a small part of the U.S. energy picture,
he said.
   Still, ethanol has a strong cadre of supporters, who list its
benefits:
   _ Increased reliance on domestic fuels would help shrink the
nation's trade deficit and its dependence on foreign suppliers. The
United States imports more than half its oil. In the first five
months of 1990, Iraq accounted for 7.4 percent of U.S. oil imports,
according to the American Petroleum Institute.
   _ With 10 percent ethanol, gasoline burns cleaner, reducing
hazardous emissions of carbon monoxide, the government said.
Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada have programs that rely on
ethanol blends to reduce pollution.
   _ A major byproduct of ethanol production is corn gluten feed, a
protein supplement for livestock feed that is in demand at home and
abroad.
   Andreas said the industry needs an extension in federal tax
subsidies to maintain what has been a marginally profitable
business.
   The tax break forgives 6 cents of a 9-cent federal excise tax on
each gallon of ethanol sold by an oil company. The subsidy is set
to expire in three years.
   R.G. Ensz, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute,
said ethanol production is not profitable without the tax break. He
added that studies disagree on whether ethanol production is
energy-efficient.
   He said the energy used in transporting and processing the fuel,
together with the fuel used by tractors and other equipment in
working the corn fields, ``can use up as much energy as you make.''
   But Ryan said he uses 23 gallons of diesel and some petroleum in
nitrogen fertilizer to cultivate and harvest each acre, which
brings enough corn to produce 250 to 300 gallons of ethanol.

   Rock fans of all generations
climbed a Prague hill and ignored a pouring rain Sunday to hear the
Rolling Stones, a band once vilified by the Communist government as
a capitalist money-making machine.
   ``What's a little acid rain between friends,'' quipped lead
singer Mick Jagger when the summer rain began falling on the crowd
of 110,000 during the Saturday night show.
   He used his newly acquired Czech to occassionally address the
crowd between songs.
   Several teen-age girls had to be carried away on stretchers
after fainting during the six-hour wait for the group at Strahov
Stadium.
   Shortly before midnight, an anonymous caller told the event's
organizers that a bomb had been planted in the stadium.
   While the group played ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' about 100
policemen searched the gigantic stage structure but found no
evidence of explosives.
   Shortly before the performance, the Rolling Stones were received
by President Vaclav Havel at Hradcany castle. The former dissident
playwright became president in December after a peaceful revolution
toppled the country's hard-line Communist leaders.
   ``In the conversation with Mick Jagger and other members of the
band, the president expressed his joy over the fact that the
concert is taking place and spoke of the role rock music played in
the events leading to the November revolution and the revolution
itself,'' the Czechoslovak news agency CTK reported.
   Proceeds from the concert are to go to the Czechoslovak
Children's Foundation set up by Olga Havlova, the president's wife.
   ``I have listened to their music very often ... songs like
`Satisfaction' are hard to forget, and if their show is at least
half as good as people say, I can't wait to see them live with my
very own eyes,'' Havel told Rock &amp; Pop magazine earlier.
   The playwright-turned president is a well-known supporter of the
arts. One of his close advisers, Michael Kocab, a former rock star,
was also present at the meeting.
   ``I told Mick I used to do rock 'n' roll too, but now I am more
into heavy metal,'' said Kocab, a parliamentary deputy who is
overseeing the withdrawal of Soviet tanks from Czechoslovakia.
   Another parliamentary deputy, veteran rock singer Vladimir
Misik, opened the concert with his band, ETC. In the early 1980s,
the band was banned from performing in Czechoslovakia.
   ``It borders on science fiction out there, we all started
shaking only after the show,'' Misik said, as he popped open a
bottle of champagne, a gift from the Rolling Stones to his band.
   Listening to ETC backstage, Bobby Keyes, a saxophone player
currently playing with the Rolling Stones, said: ``It's very good
stuff, considering those guys had to work in such terrible
conditions all their lives.''
   Chuck Leavell, a keyboard player, added: ``The people seem to
understand what rock 'n' roll is about.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: After Three Months, Budget Summit Gets Nowhere</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Bill Frenzel always seems disgruntled.
It's just the nature of the senior Minnesota Republican.
   So when Frenzel released his recent recap of this year's budget
talks, it was no surprise to see it titled, ``Diary of a
Disgruntled Summiteer.''
   But glancing through his notes and comments would make most
citizens disgruntled too. Seen as a whole, the three-month old
budget summit is clearly less than the sum of the hot rhetoric that
has surrounded it.
   Frenzel, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee,
recalls back in early May how President Bush issued his ``no
preconditions'' statement _ the first hint that Bush was abandoning
his pledge not to raise taxes.
   ``Now things should move,'' Frenzel says.
   But, of course, they didn't.
   The diary is loaded with recitations of the daily crises that
seem ridiculous in retrospect but which, at every turn, threatened
to derail the negotiations.
   ``Perhaps both sides can settle down to serious bargaining ...
Looking for a jump start ... It is an opening bid to get things
moving ... A sign of progress,'' he writes at various points.
   As the talks got older, the two sides seemed to meet more and
accomplish less. ``Closed summit meeting produces hot words and no
discernible progress,'' Frenzel notes for July 19.
   Sometimes the debate takes on an almost absurd quality.
   For example, in meetings on May 22 and May 24, the negotiators
``decide NOT to decide on a $50 billion (deficit reduction) target
for this year's package and $500 billion over five years.''
   Two months later, on July 24 _ ``Whoopee'' _ the group decides
those goals are okay.
   What happened in the intervening weeks?
   The budget situation got worse, of course. New administration
estimates show red ink in fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, will be
near $170 billion _ not including the cost of the savings and loan
bailout.
   The $50 billion deficit-reduction goal for next year seems
modest indeed. But does that drive the negotiators closer to a
solution?
   ``No meetings, no progress,'' Frenzel says of the last days
before Congress departed for its summer recess.
   Curmudgeonly and partisan, Frenzel naturally blames the
Democrats for most of the problems in the talks. And the central
message of his diary isn't really news. Even a casual follower of
Washington's ways knows that the budget summit has been a flop.
   The Frenzel diary could easily be discounted as yet another GOP
attempt to set the foundation for pinning the eventual failure of
the talks on the Democrats who control Congress. Bush has made
several clumsy attempts, and the Democrats have, of course, tried
to return the favor.
   But what's truly disheartening about the diary is what isn't in
there. At no point does Frenzel mention any pressure from the
public on the negotiators to get their job done.
   If anything, it alludes to lawmakers' reactions to public
demands not to raise taxes and not to cut their benefits. That's
been the formula for stalemate for years.
   The negotiators will resume their efforts next month, possibly
with a private retreat away from the pressures of inquiring
reporters, lobbyists, and others who might distract from the task
at hand.
   But after three months of relatively little public pressure, why
would further insulating the negotiators make an agreement more
likely?
   Frenzel is stepping off the treadmill, retiring from the seat he
first won in 1970, so his political future doesn't ride much on the
outcome of the talks. He's been mentioned as a possible future
secretary of commerce because of his expertise in trade as a member
of the Ways and Means Committee.
   With no re-election campaign at stake, Frenzel's frustration may
actually stem from his desire to get something done about the
deficit before leaving Congress.
   Taking readings on his disgruntlement may be one way to monitor
the progress of the talks ahead.

   Physicians treating Lee Atwater have not
decided when to release the Republican National Committee chairman
from the hospital, a spokeswoman says.
   ``There is no release date and ... I have heard no discussion of
that,'' Leslie Goodman, the RNC spokeswoman, said on Sunday.
   Atwater has been undergoing radiation therapy at a Washington
hospital since Wednesday for brain tumor ``progression.''
   Published reports had indicated that physicians found a new
tumor in the brain of the 39-year-old South Carolinian. But Goodman
has said doctors were not specific about whether Atwater was
afflicted with a new tumor or the recurrence of a previous one.
   Atwater, who gained prominence in national political circles
when he directed President Bush's 1988 campaign, underwent brain
tumor surgery on April 3. He has since been in and out of the
hospital repeatedly for treatment of ailments ranging from a blood
clot in his leg to a nagging fever.
   Atwater was described as alert and said to be receiving visitors
following therapy. Goodman said Sunday that his condition was
``unchanged.''

<HEAD>NAACP, Other Groups To Fight Social Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NAACP and more than 100 other
organizations ranging from law enforcement to religious groups have
formed a coalition to battle nagging social ills in black
communities.
   The group, calling itself the National Association of Black
Organizations, grew out of a three-day ``Summit Conference of Black
Organizations'' in Washington assembled by the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Coalition members, which include groups as varied as the
National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives and the
Progressive National Baptist Convention, will focus their efforts
on such problems as teen-age pregnancy, school dropouts and other
social problems.
   NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said the coalition is
designed to enhance the ``continuing struggle of African Americans
to gain a fair share of the American dream.''
   The organization's plans call for establishment of a
communications network to share information, development of a brain
trust to research and make recommendations on social and economic
concerns affecting blacks, spreading of effective self-help
initiatives, and development of strategies to strengthen support
for black institutions.
   The NAACP moves in a new direction with the formation of the
coalition. The nation's preeminent civil rights organization has
traditionally focused on legislation and litigation.
   ``What we have accomplished here is but a beginning,'' Hooks
said. ``It marks the start of a new approach, where the visible
payoff is farther down the road.''
   Hooks said the NAACP does not intend to turn from its historical
focus. But he said the 81-year-old group also realizes the need for
black organizations to address problems facing blacks.
   ``We as black people are stepping up to the bat and saying we
are taking responsibility for our own destiny,'' Hooks said.
   He said the coalition's nine-member executive committee would
meet within two weeks to work out further details.
   The conference concluded Saturday.

   Members of one family fired at a

the military says.
   A military report Sunday said the incident, which involved the
two feuding Moslem families of Pangilan and Jafani, occurred in the
town of Parang in Sulu province, 600 miles south of Manila.
   The report said Pangilan men apparently attacked to avenge the
killing of their relatives in October by the other group.
   The casualties of Friday's rampage included an undetermined
number of bystanders besides Jafani family members, the report said.
   Clan clashes, kidnappings and attacks from Moslem separatists
and Communist guerrillas are rampant in several parts of Mindanao

   Shipping radios crackled today with the
sound of U.S. warships challenging almost every commercial vessel
in the southern Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported.
   But at midday, there were no Iraqi vessels in the area.
   ``Even the two Iraqi freighters that were anchored there for
days are no longer around,'' said one of the executives, referring
to the Al-Abid and Al-Baya.
   The shipping executives said they believed that Baghdad ordered
Iraqi shipping away from the area while U.S. Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney was visiting the United Arab Emirates, where he arrived
early today from Bahrain.
   Two Iraqi freighters last week were refused entry by United Arab
Emirates ports on the gulf, while two Iraqi tankers were refused
entry by Saudi Arabia on the Red Sea, on the other side of the
Arabian Peninsula.
   The four vessels were anchored in international waters off both
coasts.
   The shipping standoff escalated with the first warning shots
fired Saturday by U.S. warships at two Iraqi tankers that refused
to stop for inspection as they were sailing out the Strait of
Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf.
   The two tankers, the 36,397-ton Baba Gurgur and the 35,338-ton
Khanaqin, were empty.
   ``Saddam Hussein must have just sent them sailing down to test
the U.S. reaction after (U.S. President) George Bush's order to use
force if necessary in the so-called interdiction,'' said one of the
shipping sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S.-led interdiction effort is an outgrowth of the U.N.
trade embargo imposed on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion and
subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   ``This is U.S. Navy warship, this is U.S. Navy warship,'' one of
the warships was overheard to radio today on the VHF channel that
was being monitored. Then it asked for last port of call and
destination.
   ``They are calling every vessel, every tanker,'' said one of the
shipping executives. ``It's all going on normally, with all the
ships cooperating.''
   He said the only problem was when sailors could not understand
English. In those cases, they would call the captain to continue
the exchange in English, the international maritime language.
   Most vessels contacted were tankers sailing to and from the
Saudi Arabian oil terminal of Ras Tanura, and other Saudi ports.
   ``Thank you for your cooperation,'' the U.S. warships were
invariably responding as they ended one radio challenge to turn to
the other.
   The shipping executives said the radio contacts were begun this
morning by the British warships, allies of the United States in the
interdiction effort. Then the Americans took over later in the day.

<TEXT>
   Jurors in the Central Park jogger case said the
mood in the jury room was often tense, but they were never split
along racial lines.
   ``The first thing we did in the jury room was to decide whether
or not this case had racial overtones and we all decided it did
not. That cleared the air,'' jury foreman Earle Fisher said.
   Over the next 10 days, the panel _ made up of four blacks, four
whites, three Hispanics and one Asian _ considered the charges
against three of six youths charged with brutally attacking a
female jogger who was raped, beaten and left for dead.
   The verdicts were announced Saturday evening. Yusef Salaam, 16,
Antron McCray, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, were convicted of rape,
assault, robbery and riot, but acquitted of attempted murder and
sodomy.
   Sentencing was set for Sept. 11. They will be sentenced as
juvenile offenders and face a maximum of up to 10 years in prison.
All three defense attorneys promised to appeal.
   Three other defendants, Kharey Wise, 18, Kevin Richardson, 15,
and Steven Lopez, 16, go on trial next month.
   Juror Rafael Miranda said the mood in the jury room was often
tense, with ``a lot of screaming, and a lot of names called.'' But
Miranda said the jury never divided along racial lines during the
deliberations.
   For the final three days, one juror held out against convicting
McCray.
   Juror Ron Gold told The New York Times he felt ``terrible'' when
he finally went along with the others and convicted McCray of rape
and assault.
   The anonymous victim became a national figure as she recovered
from the savage assault by a rampaging youth gang during her
nightly run on April 19, 1989.
   She took the stand during the trial, testifying that she did not
remember the attack but describing the lingering physical problems,
inluding impaired vision and balane, and the loss of her sense of
smell.
   ``We noticed that she had trouble walking, we noticed that she
had trouble speaking,'' said juror Migdalia Fuentes. ``We knew that
she would never be the same, that she would never enjoy life in the
same way.''
   Fuentes said the jogger's appearance on the stand ``showed a lot
of courage.''
   Jurors said the acquitted the youths of attempted murder because
they did not think the youths intended to kill the jogger.
   Juror Charles Nestorick said the attempted murder charges ``gave
us a lot of difficulty because she had really been beaten.''
   But he said the jurors felt the teens didn't realize how badly
they had hurt her. ``Youths that age are not well versed in how
many blows it takes to kill someone,'' he said.
   After three days of deliberating on nothing but the attempted
murder charges, ``we saw that we couldn't prove intent,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's embattled prime minister said
today he will also act as foreign minister following the
resignation of the country's top diplomat.
   Lothar de Maiziere told a news conference in East Berlin he was
taking the action to keep the process of German unification on
track.
   Foreign Minister Markus Meckel quit earlier today after his
political party bolted from the broad governing coalition formed to
lead the nation to unity with West Germany.
   Meckel, a top-ranking member of the left-leaning Social
Democrats, is the fifth minister to leave the coalition in a week.
   De Maiziere previously dismissed four other ministers in a
political dispute that led to the Social Democrats' decision to
leave the coalition formed after the nation's first free elections
on March 18.
   The Social Democrats, the second-biggest party in Parliament,
voted on Sunday to leave the government and vowed to speed the
process of German unity.
   The party said it would seek a vote in Parliament on Wednesday
to advance the date for German unification to mid-September.
   ``There is hardly another alternative,'' said the Social
Democrats' deputy chairman, Karl-August Kamilli.
   The Social Democrats were the second-largest party in the
coalition led by de Maiziere's conservative Christian Democrats.
   Pressure has been building in East Germany to unify quickly with
West Germany so the richer country can deal directly with the
former Communist country's difficult transition to the free market.
   The Social Democrats in both Germanys also want unification to
take place much sooner than elections so West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl can be held accountable at the voting booth for the
costs of bailing out East Germany.
   East Germany can invoke a clause in the West German constitution
and unite with West Germany at any time. De Maiziere and Kohl have
been trying to keep the election date and the unification date
close together.
   German unification is now tentatively set for Oct. 14, with
all-German elections to be held on Dec. 2.
   The East German Social Democrats had been threatening to leave
the coalition for weeks. A smaller Liberal alliance left the
government earlier this month.
   The bickering peaked last week when de Maiziere unilaterally
fired four ministers in his Cabinet, three of whom dealt with the
nation's crumbling economy.
   The Social Democrats accused de Maiziere of firing the ministers
to protect his party politically when voters in both nations choose
which party will lead a united Germany.
   The Social Democrats are closely allied with the West German
Social Democrats, the main opposition to Kohl. Kohl, like de
Maiziere, is a Christian Democrat.
   The departure of the Social Democrats will not derail the
process of merging the two Germanys. But it does solidify the
party's role as an opposition force in East Germany.
   All major East German parties are committed to unification but
they differ sharply on a timetable and on the details of a state
treaty that is to mesh the laws of the two Germanys.
   The collapse of the broad, politically diverse coalition chosen
after East Germany's first free elections on March 18 is yet
another psychological blow to a nation already reeling from a
hemorrhaging economy.
   Joblessness and prices has skyrocketed ever since the nation
shed four decades of socialism for the free market on July 1 by
merging its economy with West Germany's.
   The Social Democrats rebuffed de Maiziere's last-minute offer to
discuss their differences. The prime minister said he made the
offer ``because we in the interests of the people of East Germany
must solve our difficult problems together.''
   He called the Social Democrats' decision a ``flight from
responsibility.'
   With the loss of the Social Democrats, de Maiziere will lack the
guaranteed two-thirds majority in Parliament needed to approve the
unification treaty with West Germany.
   Kohl's government has warned that that could mean that West
German laws would be imposed unilaterally on East Germany.
   The treaty being negotiated now seeks to preserve some East
German laws. The country, for example, has tougher drunken driving
rules and more liberal abortion laws.

   An 11-year-old girl at the center of a
hospital baby-swap case has met the couple proven through genetic
tests to be her parents.
   But Kimberly Mays is still confused by the legal tug-of-war and
all the attention from a family she never knew, her grandmother
told the St. Petersburg Times in an article published Saturday.
   The long-awaited meeting between the Sarasota girl and her
biological parents, Ernest and Regina Twigg, took place quietly
last spring at a miniature golf course in Sarasota.

died of cancer in 1981. The girl born to the Mayses, whom the
Twiggs named Arlena, died`of a heart defect two years ago.
   During an initial rendezvous and two subsequent meetings,
Kimberly also was introduced to her seven brothers and sisters.
   ``??|???ly with the kids it went very good. But when you ask
about the parents, she just puts her hands up in the air and shakes
them,'' said Velma Coker, one of Kimberly's grandmothers.
   ``She's still mixed-up,'' Mrs. Coker said.
   The Twiggs learned through a blood test that Arlena couldn't be
their daughter shortly before she died.
   Searching for their biological daughter, the Twiggs learned that
Mrs. Mays had delivered a daughter within a couple of days of
Arlena's birth at the same hospital, Hardee Memorial in Wauchula.
The babies were the only two white girls born about the time at the
hospital.
   It wasn't until genetic tests last fall that it was confirmed
that the families had raised each other's daughters. Mays agreed to
the tests after the Twiggs promised they wouldn't seek custody no
matter what the tests showed.
   Mays has since joined the Twiggs in a lawsuit against Hardee
Memorial Hospital.
   Efforts to reach Mays and the Twiggs over the weekend for
further comment were unsuccessful; both families have unlisted
telephone numbers.

<HEAD>OPEC Says Not Enough Support to Hold Emergency Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC said today there was not enough
support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider
Saudi Arabia's request to boost oil production.
   A brief statement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said its president, Algerian Mines Minister Sadek
Boussena, would meet with some other oil ministers before the end
of the month to discuss the situation. It did not elaborate.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said Saturday his
country would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels
a day with or without the support of OPEC.
   He had urged the cartel to hold a special session to try to take
measures to bring down oil prices, which have soared because of the
Middle East crisis.
   But the statement issued by OPEC's headquarters in Vienna said
that ``an extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference has not been
able to secure the necessary support'' of seven of the group's 13
members.
   ``An extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference will,
consequently, not be held,'' the statement said.
   Saudi Arabia's pledge to increase its production by as much as 2
million barrels a day would make up about half of the crude lost to
world markets because of the international embargo on oil shipments
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The kingdom, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, was pumping about
5.3 million barrels of oil a day at the end of July, according to
the International Energy Agency.

<HEAD>Wire Company Executives on Trial For Alleged Worker Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suburban Chicago wire manufacturer criminally
exposed 43 workers to toxic chemicals, say prosecutors trying the
case in Cook County Court.
   Chicago Magnet Wire Co. employees suffered severe headaches,
dizziness, vomiting, kidney problems, memory loss and impotence
after working at the plant, prosecutors charge. Temperatures
reached 120 degrees and ventilation was poor, they say.
   Chicago Magnet of northwest suburban Elk Grove Village is the
second company in Illinois history to be charged with criminal
responsibility for alleged job-related injuries sustained by its
workers.
   But defense attorneys contend conditions at the wire coating
plant were safe and complied with federal standards.
   ``We don't think they have a case,'' said Harvey Silets, one of
five defense attorneys. ``We don't think anyone was really injured.
The facility operated within the standards set by the federal
government.''
   Five current or former top-level managers are charged with
aggravated battery, reckless conduct and conspiracy. Prosecutors
allege they lied about potential hazards to employees, many of whom
spoke only Spanish, and failed to provide protective gear.
   On the first day of testimony last week, six years after charges
were filed, assistant state's attorney Frank Parkerson called
working conditions at the plant ``slow torture.''
   He argued that company officials are guilty of violence akin to
street crimes, except in this case, the offenders were
``individuals wearing ties.'' Defense attorney Patrick Tuite said
plant inspections in 1983 by the federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and an insurance company failed to find
unhealthful conditions.
   Prosecutors allege that plant officials had been told of the
OSHA inspection two weeks in advance and were able to hide or
correct hazardous conditions.
   On trial in Cook County Criminal Court are Anthony Jordan, the
company's former president; former plant manager Kevin Keane; Frank
Asta, who was head of maintenance; Allan Simon, then a plant
engineer; and Gerald Colby, then in charge of quality control,
maintenance and engineering. Asta and Colby are the only defendants
who still work at the plant.
   The case is being heard by Criminal Court Judge Earl Strayhorn,
who dismissed the charges in 1985. They were reinstated by the
state Supreme Court in February 1989.
   In the first such case in Illinois, three executives of Film
Recovery Systems Inc. were convicted of murder in the cyanide
poisoning death of a worker.
   The Illinois Appellate Court reversed the verdict on a
technicality in January and ordered a retrial. No trial date has
been set.

<HEAD>Controversial Seabrook Nuclear Plant Begins Regular Operation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear power plant has ended
five months of reactor tests and has begun regular operation to
supply electricity to New England, a spokesman said today.
   The tests ended Friday night, and after a review Saturday
determined that the final round of tests had been successful,
regular operation began at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, spokesman Ron Sher
said.
   The tests began March 20, and the plant has been operating at
100 percent during the past few weeks of final testing. It has been
generating power for New England residents since first connected to
the region's electrical power grid on May 29, as its systems were
tested.
   The $6.5 billion plant, whose constrution was bitterly protested
by anti-nulear activists, is producing 1,150 megawatts of
electricity, enough to supply 1 million homes and eliminate the
need for about 1.5 million barrels of oil a month, plant operator
New Hampshire Yankee says.
   New Hampshire Yankee Senior Vice President Ted Feigenbaum said
Iraq's invasion of oil-rich Kuwait makes it ``painfully clear that
New England must immediately begin vigorous development of
alternative domestic energy sources that are not dependent opon
events halfway around the world.''
   Sher said it will be up to each of the plant's utility owners
and utility regulators in their states to decide how Seabrook's
power will be reflected in power bills.
   Critics of the plant, located near the Massachusetts border,
said it should not have been built because the area around the
plant could not be evacuated quickly enough in the event of an
accident.

   Officials kept a wary eye on the sky and
on a leaking dam after workers laboring under emergency lights
sandbagged a leaky dam early today to protect homes from a
rain-swollen lake.
   Heavy rain and the threat of a dam break forced the evacuation
of a hospital and apartments for the elderly Sunday, and residents
in the sparsely populated area below the dam were advised to leave
or get ready to evacuate.
   A flash flood watch was posted today for the northern third of
Indiana, including the Rochester area. But as of midmorning, the
rain was intermittent.
   ``The dam is holding its own right now,'' said Lisa Carr, a
dispatcher with the Fulton County Sheriff's Department. ``At this
point, we're just keeping our fingers crossed.''
   ``If we don't get any more rain, we'll be all right,'' Mayor
Philip Thompson had said earlier.
   Workers Sunday night and early today at Lake Manitou hauled
sandbags and rock to shore up the 5-foot-high earth and concrete
dam, then called it quits, leaving volunteers and state officials
to watch for signs of deterioration.
   Carr said sandbagging efforts had not resumed as of midmorning,
but added: ``If anything should happen, we'll be out there again.''
   Early Sunday, 50 to 75 people were evacuated from the Waterhaven
Apartments, and 26 of the 28 patients at Woodlawn Hospital were
moved to a nursing home and a gym.
   Lake Manitou is about 12 feet above Mill Creek, which flows
along the eastern edge of Rochester, a town of 5,000 in
north-central Indiana.
   A complete failure of the 42-year-old dam could raise Mill Creek
by 6 feet, the weather service said. It would crest in Rochester
within a half hour.
   ``The biggest problem it would affect would be our hospital. If
the dam was to go out, a large quantity of water would hit it,''
said Robert Bryant, Fulton County chief jailer.
   At least 1,000 people, including volunteers, fire crews, civil
defense officials and groups from two Rochester High School class
reunions, filled sandbags and laid about 13,000 along the dam early
Sunday, Bryant said.
   An elderly woman suffered an apparent heart attack during the
sandbagging, authorities said. Her condition was not immediately
available.
   Three workers were treated for heat exhaustion.
   Thompson said two channels were cut to divert lake water and
ease pressure on the 150-yard stretch of dam and earthen levee.
Bruce C. Murray of the Army Corps of Engineers said Sunday that he
believed the dam would hold.
   Earlier in the weekend, a similar threat faced the west-central
Wisconsin town of Tomah. About 1,500 people evacuated their houses
when high water threatened to rupture the Lake Tomah Dam on the
Lemonweir River.
   About 700 people stayed out of their homes during the night but
were able to return Sunday.
   Tomah got about 8 inches of rain in three hours late Friday.
   The dam was reinforced with about 20,000 sandbags and its
reservoir dropped eight inches by Saturday night after the
floodgates were opened, said Tomah Fire Chief Tom Flock.

   U.S. Marines here are confident
they can cope with whatever problems they face, despite punishing
conditions and logistical challenges, a commanding general said
today.
   ``We are ready to do whatever we need to do,'' said Maj. Gen.
John Hopkins, head of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade based in
Twentynine Palms, Calif.
   The brigade has deployed in a commercial port and surrounding
desert in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia.
   For security reasons, the Defense Department has barred
reporters from disclosing specific information such as the number
of Marines in Saudi Arabia, their location and the number of
weapons they carrying.
   So far about 90 percent of the equipment the brigade needs has
flowed into Saudi Arabia, Hopkins told reporters.
   ``We're not battle-ready right this moment, but we'll be ready
pretty shortly,'' he said.
   Although the brigade trained in the Mojave Desert, Hopkins said
even he was overwhelmed by the vastness of the Arabian desert,
where tempertures routinely soar to 130 degrees.
   ``We are going through growing pains, and all the troops are
getting acclimatized,'' he said, adding he feels ``damn confident.''
   The equipment the Marines brought with them will enable them to
fight on land in the air.
   The brigade has carried weapons for every conceivable wartime
situation including: M-60 tanks, high utility multipurpose
vehicles; Howitzers; TOW missiles; 40 milimeter grenade launchers;
Harrier jets; Cobra helicopters equipped with sidewinder missiles
and TOWs; Huey helicopters for command and control; CH-46 _
so-called Sea Knights _ to transport people, and wide-bellied C-150
transport planes.
   All told, five cargo ships _ some were based in the Pacific
Island of Diego Garcia _ will unload materiel for the brigade. Most
of the equipment, including the helicopters, has to be reasembled
on the ground.
   It is the first time since formation of the preposition program
in 1979 that it has been used in a contingency situation, officials
said.
   But a brigade typically has about 16,500 men. Pentagon officials
have said as many as 45,000 Marines could end up in the desert
kingdom.
   Expeditionary units are designed to become combat-capable in 10
days and sustain itself for 30 days without resupply.
   The ground combat Marines have been sent to the desert, where
they have set up tents covered by camoflauge netting to escape the
sun and avoid detection from above.
   Aviators and maintenance crews are working 16 hours to 18 hours
a day to ready their craft and learn the terrain.
   Despite harsh conditions, Lt. Col. M.M. Kurth said there was a
``sense of excitement'' among Marines, who are eager to try out
what they've learned in real life.
   ``Morale is very high,'' he said.

<HEAD>Report: Food Stamp and Welfare Rolls Rising Dramatically</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large jump in the number of people eligible
for food stamps and welfare benefits this year is costing states
and the federal government billions of dollars, a published report
said today.
   At least 44 states have reported increases in enrollment, with
some rising up to 50 percent, according to an Agriculture
Department report quoted in The New York Times.
   The number of people receiving food stamps rose by 1.3 million
from May 1989 to May 1990, when it topped 20 million for the first
time since 1985, found a report submitted to Congress by the
Agriculture Department.
   The department, which administers the food stamp program, noted
that food stamp rolls have risen 16 percent in the last year in
Texas, 19 percent in Florida, 26 percent in Nevada, 54 percent in
New Hampshire, 12 percent each in Georgia and Massachusetts, 7
percent each in New York State and California, and 21 percent in
Connecticut.
   Congress appropriated $14.8 billion, but that proved inadequate
and it had to provide an additional $1.2 billion in May. It then
directed the Agriculture Department to investigate the causes.
   The department report said that ``44 states and the District of
Columbia experienced a growth in participation'' in the food stamp
program over the last year, while the nation's unemployment rate
was relatively stable.
   It also said, ``Many states are showing signs of economic
slowdown that are not reflected in national economic indicators.''
   The Times said Michigan even blamed the increase in welfare
caseload on a state ban on Medicaid-financed abortions.
   F. Charles Peller, a spokesman for the state's Department of
Social Services, reported ``a startling increase'' in the number of
Aid to Families with Dependent Children program cases about a year
after the ban took effect.
   The newspaper said federal and state authorities also believe
tne numbers of welfare and food stamp recipients rose after
Congress made changes in the Medicaid program which made the
welfare system more accessible to some women.
   And authorities also note that some states such as Texas are
aggressively trying to make social welfare benefits and services
more available by simplifying application forms and allowing
potential participants to apply for multiple programs at a single
site.
   In addition, federal officials say some increase in food stamp
rolls may have resulted from the immigration law under which
thousands of illegal aliens have gained legal status since 1987.

   The Central Park jogger case touched raw nerves
among New Yorkers from the time the victim was found close to death
in a puddle of mud and blood until the jury pronounced its verdict.
   People were horrified by the viciousness of the attack in April.
New Yorkers were inspired by the victim's recovery and cheered by
reports of her high-fiving a nurse.
   ``As a woman, I can't tell you how much my heart goes out to
her,'' Gina Smith, a 33-year-old neighbor, said at the time. ``I
just hope God does his best for her.''
   Feelings of horror about the crime soon turned to deep anger,
much of it toward the suspects. And because the victim was a white
investment banker and the suspects were black youngsters, there
were charges that the media and criminal justice system had found
them guilty even before they appeared in court.
   A jury on Saturday found three teen-agers guilty of rape and
assault but innocent of the most serious charge, attempted murder.
   In a statement today on behalf of the jogger, Salomon Brothers
spokeswoman Lisa Barowitz said, ``She has no comment as there are
still other legal proceedings pending.'' The jogger is a vice
president at Salomon Brothers.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, who prosecuted
the case, also refused to discuss the jogger's reaction to the
verdict, saying, ``I respect her privacy.''
   The New York Post today quoted an unidentified source as saying
the jogger said, ``Thank God this is over'' when she heard the
news. ``She was thrilled. She was relieved. She was grateful to the
jurors,'' the newspaper quoted the source as saying. ``She called
them `wonderful people.'''
   The trial raised issues of race, sex and class, and the
difficulty of maintaining a presumption of innocence in the wake of
intense publicity.
   Calvin O. Butts III, a prominent black minister, said during
deliberations that in the days and weeks just after the attack,
``So convincing was the coverage that everyone assumed guilt.''
   ``Ninety percent of the people I talked to _ black and white _
thought they were guilty. It was an outrage over the crime,'' he
said. ``Only recently ... people began to realize there was some
reasonable doubt.''
   A week after the attack, Barbara Campbell, a writer on
children's issues, said, ``My first reaction had been one of horror
that young people had hurt someone so badly. But shortly thereafter
I read the news reports that portrayed the children as bestial,
with the implication that they were not human, they were animals,
and I became angry about that.''
   All the elements were there for a big story: The class
difference between the victim and the alleged attackers. The
brutality and randomness of the attack. Its location in Central
Park, the heart of the city. The victim's miraculous recovery and
return to work at Salomon Brothers. The young age of the alleged
attackers.
   Others argued that it became headline news simply because the
victim was white and the suspects were black.
   ``There was a feeding frenzy on the part of the white press,
electronic as well as print, to bring somebody, anybody to
justice,'' said Wilbert Tatum, editor in chief of the Amsterdam
News, a major black newspaper in the city. ``It was because of the
nature of the profile of the woman who had been attacked and
because they were tough black boys rather than young white boys.''
   Edwin Diamond, media critic for New York magazine, said coverage
of the case, especially by local news stations, was sensational,
shallow and unclear _ but not because the media are biased against
blacks.
   ``I believe, had this victim been a black or Hispanic
Wellesley-Yale- Salomon Brothers investment banker, it would have
been a bigger story,'' he said. ``I don't believe the media is
racist but classist and melodramatic.''
   The sock-'em-hard headline and soundbite only stir things up and
do nothing to clarify a highly charged story like the jogger case,
Diamond said. He cited the term ``wilding,'' which made headlines
after it supposedly was used by a suspect in the jogger attack to
describe a crime spree by a group of youths.
   ``It put forward the most stereotypical images of blacks. ...
`The wild thing.' It hooked into rap and rock and white fears of
the mob,'' he said.
   During the trial, tensions ran high outside the courthouse.
Women's groups cried out against violence against women. News
photographers were punched by supporters of the defendants. A row
of family and supporters of the defendants walked out of the
courtroom during the prosecution's summation. The victim was
taunted as a prostitute.
   Carla Richmond, spokeswoman for the New York City chapter of the
National Organization for Women, accused the media of emphasizing
the racial issue over ``the sexism of the attack.''
   ``It has to do with our attitudes about women, and sexist
attitudes that go back a long way _ seeing the victim as being
guilty,'' she said.

   Iraqi soldiers today were winding up
their withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory, the official
Iranian news agency said, freeing up thousands of battle-hardened
troops to face U.S. forces.
   On Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the number of
Iraqi troops poised on the Kuwaiti border with Saudi Arabia had
jumped from 160,000 to 200,000. That suggested Iraqi soldiers from
the Iranian border regions might already be bolstering those in
Iraq-occupied Kuwait.
   The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas began Friday and
was expected to be completed Tuesday.
   Cheney, inspecting U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf region,
refused to say how many American troops had been deployed. The U.S.
troops were sent to protect strategic, oil-rich Saudi Arabia after
Iraq's Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait.
   Tehran newspapers today attacked the U.S. military presence in
Saudi Arabia and predicted the Saudi monarch, King Fahd, would meet
the same fate as the deposed emir of Kuwait.
   In an editorial, the newspaper Jomhuri Islami accused the king
of allowing the United States to make Saudi Arabia a virtual U.S.
state.
   ``Just as Iraq annexed Kuwait to its territory, the United
States has annexed Saudi Arabia to its realm,'' said the newspaper,
according to IRNA.
   However, the newspaper stressed that although it opposed the
U.S. military presence, it also opposed the Iraqi takeover of
Kuwait.
   The Iraqi withdrawal from Iranian border areas came as part of
an initiative by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein last week to
formally end the Iran-Iraq war. Fighting in the eight-year
Iran-Iraq conflict had effectively ended with a cease-fire two
years ago.
   In Iran's southern region near the Persian Gulf, departing Iraqi
troops shouted ``Down with the U.S.!'' and ``Allahu Akbar!'' _
``God is great!'' _ Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said.
   IRNA said the departing Iraqis expressed desires for ``more
brotherly relations'' between their countries, and waved to their
former enemies as they pulled out of fortifications along the
30-mile-long Shalamcheh-Kushk axis.
   The troop withdrawal is accompanied by the biggest prisoner
exchange since World War II. The United Nations and diplomats say
the two sides held a total of 100,000 prisoners.
   Tehran radio reported that 2,000 prisoners returned to the
Iranian capital today in a jubilant homecoming.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said thousands of relatives
and well-wishers thronged Tehran's Mehrabad airport and crowded
surrounding streets. The prisoners were showered with flowers, and
sheep were sacrificed for a traditional Islamic welcome.
   Iraq's army daily newspaper, al-Qaddisiyah, had reported that
some of the troops formerly deployed along the 730-mile Iran-Iraq
frontier would be sent south to confront U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia.
   The new Iraqi troop arrivals in Kuwait are likely to include
elements of the battle-hardened 3rd and 7th Army Corps, which saw
some of the heaviest fighting of the Persian Gulf War.
   When the U.N.-brokered cease-fire of August 1988 took effect,
Iraq was occupying an estimated 700 square miles of Iranian
territory in the western and southern border sectors.

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
before the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars
Monday:
   Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Please be
seated. And it's a privilege to join you, and a deep personal
pleasure to renew old ties, greet new friends. And my thanks to all
of you, but especially, Walter, to you, Walter Hogan, doing a great
job as Commander in Chief.
   And following the likes of Larry Rivers isn't easy. We all know
that. But Walter's done the VFW proud. And I also know we're
looking forward to the same kind of strong leadership from James
Kimmery. And let me offer my thanks again to another old friend,
Cooper Holt, a real legend, who gave so many years of service to
the VFW. Cooper, we welcome you.
   And next, I want to thank my outstanding Veterans' Secretary, a
fellow VFW member, Ed Derwinski. Ed's got so much going on, but I'm
especially happy to see the work he's doing to improve these
veterans' hospitals. And his department is intent on serving you,
much as you have served America.
   I'm glad to see the Secretary of the Army with us today, an old
friend of mine and a friend of yours, Mike Stone.
   And let us remember those who could not be with us. Our
administration will not forget our POWs and MIAs, as well as those
brave men and women as well as those brave men and women who gave
what Lincoln termed ``the last full measure of devotion.''
   Again, my acknowledgement to Mike Stone and also to Baltimore's
mayor, who courteously came to greet me, Kurt Schmoke _ glad to see
you here, sir.
   And finally, today's _ also let me single out today's honorees _
Bud Dudley and my own United Nations _ our own United Nations
ambassador, Tom Pickering, who is doing an outstanding job up there
in the United Nations for the United States of America. Both Bud
and Tom are being honored appropriately by you tonight.
   Apologies for keeping you waiting. There are some events going
on around the world, and I was on the telephone to a good friend of
the United States, President Ozal of Turkey, and also to another
great friend of the United States, Prime Minister Thatcher of the
United Kingdom. And I must say, I'm proud of the support that we
are all getting around the world.
   You know, as a veteran I want to salute this organization on its
91st year. By supporting our nation's veterans, the VFW has
enriched America, and I'd like to take a moment to ask your support
for man whom I'm convinced will also enrich America.
   I want to work in a strong plug, and I'm talking about our
Supreme Court nominee, Judge David Souter. I see the New Hampshire
delegation is here. And _ well, they know something we all know,
and that is that he is an exceptional jurist and a brilliant legal
mind and he will be a voice of excellence on the nation's highest
court, and I call on the Senate to confirm him without delay.

<HEAD>Veteran Washington Journalist Dead at 92</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard L. Strout, a Washington journalist
from the Harding administration to Ronald Reagan's first term in
the White House, has died at the age of 92.
   He died Sunday night at Georgetown University Medical Center,
where he had been admitted after a bad fall on Aug. 8, said Godfrey
Sperling, Strout's longtime colleague at the Christian Science
Monitor.
   Strout reported for the Monitor for more than 60 years and wrote
the political column ``TRB from Washington'' in the New Republic
from 1943 to 1983. He retired from the Monitor in 1984.
   In Strout's hands, the TRB column became one of the most widely
followed expressions of liberal political opinion in the nation.
   When he gave it up, the New Republic's editors observed, ``You
don't get out of Strout's church without hearing the sermon, but
the hymns are lovely. ... He looks and listens, and tells you what
he has seen and heard in vivid, simple words.''
   In his first column, at the height of World War II, Strout
called for a national statement of postwar aims, saying, ``When a
man dies, he wants to die for something important.''
   He described the Eisenhower administration as ``government by
sedative'' and likened redbaiting Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis.,
to ``a mist that carries lethal contagion.''
   Of Richard Nixon, then vice president, he wrote in 1958, ``He is
out for the kill and the scalp at any cost.''
   After his retirement, his name remained on the magazine's
masthead as a contributing editor. The TRB column has been written
in recent years by senior editor Michael Kinsley.
   The column was written anonymously for years, by Kenneth
Crawford and others and then by Strout. More recently, it has been
signed. The name TRB was coined by Bruce Bliven, an editor of the
magazine before it moved from New York to Washington. Bliven, who
carried copy to the office by subway, said the initials stood for
Brooklyn Rapid Transit in reverse.
   On his 80th birthday in 1978, Strout, still active at his job,
said, ``If you live long enough, people confuse ability with
longevity. I'm just an analytical writer with some color. I'm not a
whiz bang.''
   The same year, he was given a special citation by the Pulitzer
Prize committee for his lifetime achievement. Strout also won the
George Polk Memorial Award in 1958 and the National Press Club's
Fourth Estate Award in 1975, among others.
   Strout was born in Cohoes, N.Y. and raised in Brooklyn. His
father was an English teacher who wrote poetry. Like him, his
parents both lived into their 90's.
   After graduation from Harvard in 1919, Strout worked his way
across the Atlantic on a grain ship and worked for two years as a
reporter and editor on the Sheffield, England, Independent. After
returning to the United States in 1921, he worked briefly as a
reporter for the Boston Post. He went to work for the Boston-based
Monitor in 1922 and transferred to its Washington bureau in the
early 1920's.
   As a reporter for the newspaper, he covered the Teapot Dome
scandal, presidential political conventions and campaigns, the New
Deal's efforts to deal with the depression, the allied invasion of
Normandy on D-Day in 1944, and many other stories.
   A collection of his columns, ``TRB: Views and Perspectives on
the Presidency,'' was published in 1979. In 1936, he and humorist
E.B. White coauthored a book called ``Farewell to the Model T.''
   Strout was a champion of the parliamentary system of government
used in Britain and Canada. He said the United States'
``eighteenth-century government,'' with its presidential system,
was inflexible and resulted in long and drawn-out presidential
campaigns and ``anachronistic'' nominating conventions.
   Strout is survived by his wife, the former Ernestine Wilke;
their two children, Elizabeth Zimmerman of Minneapolis and Mary
Rubeiz of Geneva, Switzerland; and three children by a previous
marriage, Alan Mayne Strout of Weston, Mass., Phyllis Norris of
Santa Cruz, Calif., and Nancy Dulaney of Washington. Survivors also
include 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. Strout's
first wife, Edith Mayne, died in 1932.
   A private funeral service is planned. The family asked that
memorial donations be made to All Souls Church, Unitarian, of
Washington.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Log Export Restrictions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush today signed into law new
federal and state log-export restrictions to help offset lost
timber jobs and reduced harvests expected to result from protection
of the rare northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.
   The new law is designed to bolster the timber supply for
domestic timber processors. It bans exports of unprocessed logs
from most state-owned lands in the West.
   The restrictions will have the biggest impact in Washington,
Oregon and northern California, where dramatic timber harvest
reductions are anticipated because of federally mandated protection
of old-growth forests inhabited by the spotted owl.
   The prohibitions are included in a trade bill Bush signed today
before giving a speech in Baltimore, a White House spokeswoman said.
   About one in four logs currently cut in the Northwest is shipped
to more lucrative foreign markets.
   Under the new law, Washington will be allowed to continue to
export 25 percent of its state-owned logs. Raw-log exports will be
banned outright in Oregon, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico.
   The export ban is expected to keep at home more than 600 million
board feet of timber annually that currently is being exported.
That includes about 350 million board feet on Washington state
lands and 100 million board feet on Oregon state lands.
   The new law also makes permanent the prohibition on raw log
exports from federal lands in the West and close loopholes in that
ban. Those loopholes _ called direct and indirect substitution _
have enabled some timber companies to obtain federal logs from a
third party for their domestic mills while shipping their own
private logs overseas.
   In each of the last two years, about 3.6 billion board feet of
unprocessed timber has been exported from Washington and Oregon _
about 80 percent of the total nationally.
   A board foot is a piece of timber one-foot wide by one-foot long
and one inch thick.

<HEAD>BALTIMORE:... American strength.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield proves vividly that instead of relieving
past contingencies, we must prepare for the challenges of the 1990s
and beyond.
   By ensuring that our troops are ready and trained, we can exert
our presence in key areas and respond effectively to crisis, and
this is readiness measured in days and hours, not weeks and months,
and Operation Desert Shield has underscored the need to be able to
get our soldiers where they are needed and when they are needed.
This kind of responsiveness will be critical in the crises of the
future.
   Recently, our outstanding Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General
Colin Powell, spoke to this when he praised the finest peacetime
military in the history of America. We will be smaller in troop
strength and restructured, but we will remain purposeful, proud,
and effective.
   Just look at the last 18 days. Desert Shield has been a classic
case of America's military at its best. I think, for instance, of
Airman 1st Class Wade West, home on leave to be married. On August
7, he was called up, and within an hour, he had the ceremony
performed and left for the Middle East. He's now stationed over in
Saudi Arabia. You talk about a guy that gets things done.
   But, I would like to emphasize, with his bride _ wherever she
may be.
   And another example _ seven years ago, Diana Kroptivich worried
at home while her husband, Walter, steamed off the Lebanon coast on
the USS New Jersey defending the marines. Today, their roles are
reversed. Retired, Walter is at home with their 6-year-old son, and
Diana serves aboard the destroyer USS Yellowstone. Here _ here's an
Army couple.
   Today, Paratrooper Joseph Hooter of the 82nd Airborne Division
is serving in Saudi Arabia, and his wife, Nurse Dominique Allen of
the 44th Medical Brigade, will be deployed there within the next
two weeks.
   And finally, recall the 8 year old who, watching her dad leave
for the Mediterranean, spoke truth from the mouths of babes. ``I
just think,'' she said, ``that they shouldn't let daddies go away
this long, but they still have to, to keep the world safe.''
   These profiles show the true caliber of America and the vital
essence of our mission. What's more, they remind us of the fifth
and final lesson, reaffirmed by the past 18 days, the need for a
continued strong defense budget to support American troops.
   Or, as George Washington said in his first inaugural address,
``To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of
preserving the peace.'' History has shown the wisdom of his words,
especially in our century.
   What Desert Shield has shown is that America can ensure the
peace by remaining militarily strong. And now, I know that we're
operating in a time of budget restraint. We have limited resources.
We must use them wisely.
   And the budget deficit is a threat to our vital interests at
home and won't be made easier by today's threat abroad. Everyone
realizes that the deficit is too large and that it's got to be
brought down, and the Congress must act courageously and
immediately when it returns from recess.
   But here's the point. We cannot attack the deficit by attacking
the very heart of our armed forces, committed men and women who are
motivated and ready. And last week I asked Congress to do what we
have done, produce a budget proposal, including defense, that is
both responsive and responsible and, most of all, fair. And when
they do, I will listen; listen, but not break faith with the troops
who are defending our nation.
   Make no mistake, to prevent aggression, to keep America
militarily prepared, I will oppose the defense budget slashers who
are out of tune with what America needs to keep freedom secure and
safe.
   You know, most Americans know that when it comes to national
defense, finishing second means finishing last. And so they reject
what the House Armed Services Committee recently suggested _
unacceptable cuts from our defense budget for fiscal year 1991.
   Most Americans know, too, that giving peace a chance does not
mean taking a chance on peace, and so they endorse giving the
military the tools to do its job -- the peacemaker, the Midget Man,
the B-2 and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Americans want arms
negotiations to succeed, but they know that even a START treaty
will not help our security if we disarm unilaterally.
   And let us never forget that our strong national defense
policies have helped us gain the peace. We need a strong defense
today to maintain that peace. And I will fight for that defense,
and I need your help. So help me convince the Congress, given
recent events, to take another look into adequately defend _ to
fund our defense budget.
   Let me tell you a little story about why I feel so strongly. I
was talking to some of the young soldiers who liberated Panama. We
invited them to come with General Thurman and others to the Cabinet
Room for a briefing for me. And I asked one of them, a medic, about
the operation. Corporal Roderick Ringstaff spoke of combat, and he
spoke of the heroics of others, but not of his own. And next to him
was his commanding officer. And so his commanding officer filled in
the rest.
   This medic had been wounded but repeatedly braved fire to rescue
other wounded, pulling soldier after soldier to safety. For that he
was awarded the Silver Star for bravery. And listening, I thought
to myself, I will never send young men and women into battle with
less than the very best that this nation can provide them. I will
never _ I will never ever let Americans like this down.
   August 1990 has witnessed what history will judge one of the
most crucial deployments of allied powers since World War II. Two
weeks ago, I called for the complete, immediate, and unconditional
withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   Second, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government.
Third, the security and the stability of Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf. And fourth, the safety and protection of American
citizens abroad.
   And today, I say those objectives are and will remain unchanged.
And will it take time? Of course, for we're engaged in a cause
larger than ourselves. A cause perhaps best shown by words many of
you remember, words spoken by one of the greatest Americans of our
time to allied soldiers, and sailors, and airmen: ``The eyes of the
world are upon you,'' he told them. ``The hopes and prayers of
liberty loving people everywhere march with you.''
   And then he concluded with this moving prayer, ``Let us all
beseech the blessing of almighty God upon this great and noble
undertaking.''
   Fellow veterans, more than half of all VFW members fought in
World War II. Many of you serving under the man who spoke those
words, Dwight David Eisenhower. And you know how America remains
the hope of liberty loving people everywhere.
   Half a century ago, the world had the chance to stop a ruthless
aggressor and missed it. And I pledge to you, we will not make that
mistake again. Together _ for you see, together we can successfully
oppose tyranny and help those nations who look to us for leadership
and vision.
   Thank you for your support and your prayers and may God bless
the land we deeply love, the United States of America. Thank you
all and God bless you.

   A 40-year-old lawyer was charged today
with killing of one of nine women believed to be victims of a
serial killer.
   Kenneth C. Ponte entered a plea of ``absolutely not guilty''
during a Superior Court appearance after an indictment naming him
was unsealed. Bond was set at $500,000; he was released on bail at
midday.
   Ponte, 40, has frequently been named in news stories as a
suspect in the case, but until today prosecutors had not formally
named him. Bristol District Attorney Ronald Pina declined today to
say whether Ponte was a suspect in the other slayings.
   The indictment accuses Ponte of beating Rochelle Clifford
Dopierla to death April 27, 1988. Her body was discovered the
following December.
   Dopierla was one of nine women whose bodies were found near this
southeastern Massachusetts community between July 1988 and April
1989. Pina said at today's hearing that Ponte killed her because
she was planning to expose his drug activities.
   All the victims had histories of drug use and some were
prostitutes. Two other women have also been missing and are
presumed dead.
   Ponte, who now lives in Florida, has acknowledged being a
suspect in the case, but has denied any involvement in the killings.
   ``Mr. Ponte welcomes a trial,'' said defense attorney Kevin
Reddington. ``He needs a trial to clear his name.''
   Pina said Ponte ``crossed the line from the legal community and
became a member of the drug community.''
   ``This man went into a drug world, he recruited women, he used
them to purchase his drugs, he brought them into his home,'' Pina
said.
   The indictment was issued by a grand jury that has been
investigating the deaths since last year. The grand jury spent most
of last week examining evidence presented by Pina in connection to
the nine victims.
   The indictment was sealed for a few days at Pina's request so
the victim's relatives could be briefed.
   On Friday, Pina also asked that the grand jury not be discharged
from further duties, a request also granted by the judge.
   New Bedford investigators have reported that Dopierala's mother
told them her daughter once gave her Ponte's home telephone if her
mother wanted to reach her in New Bedford.
   Ponte has said his only contact with Dopierala was in April 1988
when he, as a lawyer, helped her with a man whom she accused of
raping her.
   Dopierala's body was found in a different location from those of
the other victims. She was found near an abandoned gravel pit a
quarter mile north of Interstate 195 in Dartmouth. The other bodies
were found by the side of highways in the area.

<TEXT>
   Police on Monday evicted about 100 homeless
Israelis from a ``tent camp'' set up to protest Israel's severe
housing shortage.
   It was the first time authorities evicted people living in tent
cities. About 2,000 Israelis are living in such cities around the
country to protest a housing shortage and skyrocketing rents
resulting from the influx of Soviet Jews.
   Police detained five people who rioted when a backhoe arrived
and demolished several stone and wooden huts in a camp in the Tel
Aviv neighborhood of Bnei Brak, said police spokeswoman Aviv Ivri.
   Reuven Berger, a senior official of the Bnei Brak municipality,
said the eviction was ordered after some of the 17 homeless
families began building such permanent structures on a vacant lot
where they had been allowed to pitch tents.
   ``At that moment, their plight took on the character of
squatting and ceased being a protest,'' he said.
   Berger said the municipality had supplied the homeless camp with
electricity, water and even hot meals for the children.
   Army radio said that after the eviction, some of the homeless
collected under a shelter in the lot, saying they did not know
where they would go.
   ``You see this sand here, this is where we will sleep tonight,''
one homeless person said on Israel radio.
   The housing shortage was sparked several months ago by the
influx of Soviet Jews, which has reached about 80,000 this year and
may include 70,000 others by January.
   Many rents have doubled and tripled in Israel as a result of
$300 monthly government rent subsidies given the Soviet Jews. They
receive the money a year in advance and can pay rents in a lump
sum. The higher rents have displaced young couples and poor
families.

<HEAD>Government Party Claims Victory in Local Polls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Motherland Party won 11
mayorships in local elections held in 14 towns, according to final
results announced Monday.
   It was impossible to gauge the overall strength of the party
from the results since it lost in the largest district and barely
won in another large district in Sunday's vote.
   Nevertheless, Premier Yildirim Akbulut claimed victory, saying,
``The trust of the citizens is in Motherland.''
   A surprise winner was the Democratic Left Party of former
Premier Bulent Ecevit. It won the mayorship in Bayrampasa, a
district of Istanbul. With 111,000 registered voters, it was the
largest contested in the elections.
   Motherland won by a slim margin in Etimesgut, a suburb of Ankara
and the second-largest district in the polls.
   Two extreme right-wing parties, the Moslem fundamentalist
Prosperity Party and the Nationalist Work Party, improved their
votes.
   The two major opposition parties with representation in
Parliament, the Social Democrat Populist Party and the conservative
True Path Party of former Premier Suleyman Demirel, appeared to
have lost votes since nationwide local elections in 1989.
   The Social Democrats captured two mayorships but in most
districts their support went down.
   Mayoral elections were held in these districts either because
they had been upgraded from villages to small towns or had become
separate municipalities, such as Bayrampasa.
   In 1989 nationwide local elections, the Motherland won 21.7
percent of the votes, placing third behind the Social Democrats and
True Path.

<TEXT>
   But this morning I'm also grateful to have this special
opportunity to discuss an issue of great concern to all Americans,
the crisis in the Persian Gulf. A crisis that will require American
planning, patience, and yes, personal sacrifice.
   But a crisis that we must and will meet if we are to stop
aggression, help our friends, and protect our own interests in the
peace and stability of countries around the globe.
   Eighteen days ago these beliefs prompted me to take action in
the Middle East, to restore the sovereignty of Kuwait and deter
those who threaten friendly countries and the vital interests of
America. And I acted knowing that our cause would not be easy, but
that our cause is right.
   And that while one should not underestimate those who endanger
peace, an even greater mistake would be to underestimate America's
commitment to our friends when our friends are imperiled or our
commitment to international order when that too, is imperiled.
   Today the outcome is not yet decided. Hard choices remain but of
this we are certain, America will not be intimidated. And when some
ask, ``Where does America stand?'' Our answer is America stands
where it always has, against aggression, against those who would
use force to replace the rule of law.
   And who better than this group know that throughout history
we've learned that we must stand up to evil. It's a truth which the
past 18 days have reaffirmed. And its lessons speak to America and
to the world.
   The first lesson is as vivid as the memories of Normandy, Khe
Sanh, Pork Chop Hill. We've been reminded again that aggression
must and will be checked. And so, at the request of our friends, we
have sent US forces to the Middle East, reluctantly, but
decisively, knowing, as Teddy Roosevelt said, that America means
many things, among them, equality of rights, and therefore,
equality of duty and obligation.
   And yet we are not acting alone but in concert; hoping to
protect our own national security interests, as well as those of
the broader community of nations.
   Which brings me to the second lesson reaffirmed by the past 18
days. By itself, America can do much; together with its friends and
allies, America can do much more for peace and for justice. Think
back with me to World War II when together allies confronted a
horror which embodied hell on Earth. Or Korea, where United Nations
forces opposed totalitarianism.
   Today, once again, many nations _ many of them Muslim _ have
joined to counter aggression, and thus to restore the peace. And
our Saudi friends, under the wise leadership of King Fahd, ask for
our help in deterring further aggression by Iraq. And I salute the
many countries who have courageously responded to Saudi Arabia's
request.
   I also salute those governments who are responding to the Emir
of Kuwait's call for the full enforcement of United Nations
sanctions. We must not delude ourselves. Iraq's invasion was more
than a military attack on tiny Kuwait, it was a ruthless assault on
the very essence of international order and civilized ideals.
   And now, in a further offense against all norms of international
behavior, Iraq has imposed restrictions on innocent civilians from
many countries. This is unacceptable (applause) and that's why the
United Nations Security Council voted unanimously Saturday night to
condemn Iraq's action, just as it earlier voted to condemn the
invasion itself.
   They know as we do, that leaders who use citizens as pawns
deserve and will receive the scorn and condemnation of the entire
world. (Applause.)
   And so to the leaders of Iraq I'll now make two points clear: In
moving foreign citizens against their will, you are violating the
norms of your own religion. You are going against the age-old Arab
tradition of showing kindness and hospitality to visitors.
   And so my message is: Release all foreigners now. Give them the
right to come and go as they wish. Adhere to international law and
UN Security Council Resolution 664.
   We've been reluctant to use the term ``hostage,'' but when
Saddam Husayn specifically offers to trade the freedom of those
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent
people are called, they are in fact hostages.
   And I want there to be no misunderstanding. I will hold the
government of Iraq responsible for the safety and well being of
American citizens held against their will!
   Let me also take a moment to thank President Gorbachev for his
recent words condemning the Iraqi invasion. He has shown, if anyone
doubted it, that nations which joined to fight aggression in World
War II can work together to stop the aggressors of today.
   A third lesson has also been reaffirmed by the last 18 days. As
veterans it won't surprise you, the steadfast character of the
American will. Look to the sands of Saudi Arabia and the waters
offshore where brave Americans are doing their duty just as you did
at Anzio, and Inchon, and Hamburger Hill.
   And think of the men and women aboard our planes and ships,
young, alone, and so very far from home. They make us humble. They
make us proud. And I salute the finest soldiers, sailors, airmen,
and marines that any nation could possibly have!
   And moreover, I pledge to you we will do whatever it takes to
help them compete their mission.
   This means realizing the fourth lesson reaffirmed by the past 18
days. Although the size of America's armed forces in the years
ahead will be smaller because the threat to our security is
changing, future American defense capacity must be even more a
lean, mean, fighting machine. And by 1995 we estimate that our
security needs can be met by an active force 25 percent smaller
than today's, the lowest level since 1950. And yet we must ensure
that a reduction of numbers does not mean a reduction in American
strength.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister Resigns in Bishop's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kenya's minister of labor, under fire in
the death of an outspoken Anglican bishop, announced Monday he had
offered to resign.
   The minister, Peter Okondo, has been under pressure to step down
since the Aug. 14 death of Bishop Alexander Muge, a leading
government critic.
   Three days before Muge's death, Okondo had told a public rally
that the bishop ``might not leave alive'' if he visited Okondo's
Busia constituency.
   Muge was killed when a milk truck crashed into his car as he was
returning home from visiting Busia.
   No evidence has been presented that Muge's death was anything
but an accident. The driver of the truck has been charged with
causing his death through reckless driving.
   However, the attorney general has ordered a public inquest in
response to the public outcry over his death and widespread
suggestions of foul play.
   There was no immediate word on whether President Daniel arap Moi
accepted Okondo's resignation.
   Okondo, 65, sent a brief statement to the state-owned Kenya News
Agency on Monday saying he had ``offered to resign my ministerial
appointment'' after ``consideration and appropriate consultations
regarding words I am reported to have uttered at Busia'' on Aug.
11. The statement was dated Aug. 18.
   Since his comments, calls for Okondo's resignation have come
from Anglican and other church leaders, high government officials,
and newspapers, including the government-owned Kenya Times.

<HEAD>Splinter Removal Bill: $3,700</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAND O'LAKES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The next time Jack McElhinney gets a
splinter, he plans to take care of it himself. The last one has
cost more than $3,700 to remove.
   The 57-year-old retired real estate broker had pulled most of
the splinter out of his big toe and was able to jog and play
tennis, but the sliver annoyed him.
   He went to his doctor, who X-rayed the toe and referred him to a
surgeon, who sent him to another physician. When it became
infected, the doctor said he'd have to go to the hospital to get it
removed.
   McElhinney thought it would be a simple procedure. Then a clerk
called and asked whether he had a will and had signed an organ
donor card.
   ``In retrospect, that's the point at which I should have
realized things had gotten out of control,'' McElhinney said in a
story published in Satuday's Tampa Tribune.
   He went underwent tests and the surgery was done under local
anesthesia May 31. The splinter _ about a half-inch long and
extremely thin _ was removed.
   The hospital bill was $3,177.11. The pathologists asked for
$197.35. The anesthesiologists billed him $400.
   ``I haven't even gotten the surgeon's bill yet. They'll probably
deliver that in a Brinks truck,'' McElhinney said.
   But the surgeon, Thomas DiPasquale, said his fee will be less
than the hospital's bill. Extra tests may be unnecessary 95 percent
of the time, he said, but malpractice insurance requires them.
   McElhinney's insurer paid $1,906.27 of the $3,177.11 bill. He is
supposed to pay $476, and the rest will be waived.
   McElhinney said he and his neighbors have a solution for the
next splinter.
   ``We've invested in a fancy first-aid kit,'' he said. ``We'll do
the surgery ourselves.''

   Iraq said today it had moved Western detainees to vital military
targets, making good on its threat to use them as human shields
against a potential American attack.
   The message came after Iraq warned its own people not to hide
foreigners or they would face the ``severest punishment.''
   Iraq had threatened earlier to use the trapped foreigners as
shields, and today's statement by the official Iraqi News Agency
said some had already been scattered at the target sites.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a spokesman for the
Iraqi National Council as saying: ``Iraq's foreign guests have been
in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They have
been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in good
physical condition.''
   The three-line dispatch provided no further details, such as how
many foreigners had been moved or to what installations.
   Earlier, President Bush demanded that Iraq release all
foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, and for the first time he
referred to them as hostages.
   ``There can be little doubt that whatever these innocent
citizens are called, they are in fact hostages,'' he said in a
speech to war veterans in Baltimore.
   Also today, two senior U.N. officials headed for Baghdad to urge
Iraq to free foreigners held captive in Kuwait and Iraq. U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein requested the envoys be sent.
   In his speech, Bush repeated U.S. demands that Iraq withdraw
from Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2. He also likened Saddam
Hussein to Adolf Hitler.
   An Iraqi official also referred to World War II today, reminding
the United States that it had once interned members of its own
ethnic Japanese population.
   ``In response to the official American and Western declarations
regarding Iraq's hosting of foreigners ... We would like to recall
that America, during World War II, held about 100,000 of its own
citizens of Japanese origin in detention camps to avert a potential
Japanese attack on its western coast,'' said the statement carried
by the state-run Iraqi News Agency.
   It was attributed to the Speaker of the Iraqi National Council,
or parliament, Sadi Mehdi Saleh.
   The United States, meanwhile, picked up another ally in its
military thrust against Iraq with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's
announcement today that U.S. C-130 cargo transports have begun
operating from the United Arab Emirates.
   Cheney's statement in Abu Dhabi marked an important show of
cooperation from a gulf nation with international efforts to force
Iraq out of Kuwait.
   Also today, OPEC said there was not enough support among its
members to call an emergency meeting to consider Saudi Arabia's
request to boost oil production.
   A brief statement said OPEC's president would meet with some
other oil ministers before the end of the month. Saudi Arabia said
Saturday it would boost oil production by as much as 2 million
barrels a day.
   Iraq said today that diplomats who fail to close their missions
in Kuwait by Friday will be treated as any other foreign citizen.
But in London, the Foreign office said Britain will attempt to keep
an embassy in Kuwait.
   Austria, Britain, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Sweden, and West
Germany said they had no plans to close their missions in Kuwait.
   The Iraqi radio message, monitored in Nicosia, warned Iraqi
citizens against secretly sheltering foreigners to protect them.
   ``Hosting a foreigner in an Iraqi's place of residence is
considered a flagrant violation of the law, for which the severest
punishments will be given,'' it said. It said the law applied
``with (Iraq's) entire administrative border'' _ apparently
including annexed Kuwait.
   On Sunday, Saddam offered to free foreigners if the United
States withdraws its forces from the Persian Gulf region and
guarantees the economic embargo will be lifted. U.S. officials
dismissed the offer.
   He later said he would free citizens of nations that remain
neutral in the conflict, including those of Austria, Switzerland,
Sweden, Finland and Portugal. They account for only about 600 of
the 21,000 foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait.
   There was growing international anxiety over the fate of the
remaining foreign captives, including 3,000 Americans and 4,000
Britons, held for almost three weeks.
   Saddam said Sunday Westerners will be held at vital Iraqi
installations to deter U.S. attacks on the facilities.
   ``Our people are seeking to avert a catastrophe,'' Saddam said,
in comments read on Iraqi television. ``The presence of the
foreigners with Iraqi families at vital targets might prevent an
attack.''
   Iraqi authorities also ordered Westerners in Kuwait to assemble
at hotels or face the consequences.
   In other developments:
   _The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing'' two
Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S.
vessels on Saturday.
   _U.S. warships off the United Arab Emirates were challenging by
radio practically every commercial ship coursing up and down the
Persian Gulf, shipping executives reported today.
   _Iraq said today that Indonesian and some Argentine citizens may
leave.
   _China's official Xinhua News Agency said the first group of 97
Chinese would be evacuated from Iraq today, with Baghdad's help.
Also today, 122 Soviet citizens crossed into Jordan, the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   _The British Foreign Office said today that 82 Britons were
taken Sunday by Iraqi authorities from a hotel in Kuwait city. A
day earlier, 41 British citizens were taken from the Kuwait
International hotel.
   _Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal arrived in Damascus,
Syria today to discuss the Gulf crisis with the Syrian leadership.
   _Two Dutch Navy frigates were leaving today for the Persian Gulf
to join the multinational force arrayed against Iraq. The air
defense frigate Witte de With and the standard frigate Pieter
Florisz were to take two weeks to reach the region.
   _ Greece also said it would send a frigate.
   _Iraqi soldiers today continued their withdrawal from occupied
Iranian territory, the official Iranian news agency said, freeing
up thousands of battle-hardened troops to face U.S. forces. Iraq
and Iran were also repatriating prisoners from their eight-year
war, which effectively ended with a cease-fire in August of 1988.
   _Iranian newspapers today attacked the U.S. military presence in
Saudi Arabia. The Jomhuri Islami said in an editorial the United
States had virtually annexed Saudi Arabia, just as Iraq did Kuwait.
But the newspaper stressed that although it opposes the U.S.
military presence, it also opposes the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait.
   United Arab Emirates, an alliance comprising seven sheikdoms,
today became the first of the moderate Arab governments in the
southern gulf region to publicly announce overt military
cooperation with the United States.
   On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates announced it would allow the
deployment of Arab and ``friendly'' forces on its territory as part
of multinational efforts to defend the Persian Gulf region.
   On Saturday night, the U.N. Security Council unanimously
demanded that Iraq let all foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait leave.
   CBS News said from Baghdad that 35 Americans, including four
women and three children, took refuge at U.S. diplomatic
``quarters'' in the Iraqi capital Sunday.
   Asked about the report, a spokesman at the State Department
said: ``We can't make a comment on that at this time.''

   A high-speed train plowed into the back of
a slow-moving train in thick fog on the outskirts of Warsaw on
Monday, killing 16 people and injuring more than 50, officials said.
   The force of the collision lifted the last car of the slower
train off the track. The engine of the speeding train ripped
through the car as it passed underneath.
   ``It was a macabre sight with the coach standing up, and there
was no floor,'' said a fire brigade worker who was among the first
to arrive at the scene after the 6:20 a.m. crash.
   The high-speed train was en route from Prague to Warsaw and was
moving at about 60 mph when it hit the second train, which was
traveling at about 9 mph as it arrived from Szklarska Poreba in
southwestern Poland, according to a statement from the Polish
Railroad.
   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Emergency
workers at the scene suggested the engineer of the Prague train may
not have seen the signal that caused the first train to slow down.
   Forty-three of the injured were hospitalized, the official PAP
news agency said.
   Virtually all the victims appeared to be on the slower train.
One of them, Bogdan Owsiak, told Polish television that most aboard
were sleeping when the train was hit.
   ``I managed to squeeze out through a crack, and only when I fell
to the ground did I see one of my legs was broken and I had an open
wound,'' Owsiak said. ``While we were waiting for ambulances we
could hear people crying inside the train.''
   The Prague train was not severely damaged.
   The crash occurred near the sprawling Ursus tractor factory, six
miles from the central Warsaw train station.
   Bodies wrapped in plastic were lined up on a sidewalk as rescue
workers used metal rods to pull upholstery and broken seats down
from the wreckage.
   An American Embassy official at the scene said it did not appear
there were any Americans among the dead or injured.

   Josef Schwammberger, who spent nearly 40
years as a fugitive to avoid prosecution for Nazi war crimes, was
indicted Monday in the deaths of more than 3,400 people in Poland
during World War II.
   Schwammberger, 78, was extradited from Argentina in May. As a
commander of concentration camps during the war, he was accused of
extreme cruelty, including ripping the gold fillings from
prisoners' mouths before their deaths.
   The indictment sets the stage for one of the last major Nazi war
crimes trials in Germany.
   Prosecutor's spokesman Helmut Krombacher said Schwammberger was
indicted in the deaths of ``at least 50 Jews.'' He was also charged
as an accessory to murder in the killings of at least 3,377 other
people, many of them Jews as well, Krombacher said.
   The trial is expected to take place at the beginning of next
year, the prosecutor's spokesman said.
   If convicted, Schwammberger faces a sentence of life in prison.
   According to the indictment, Schwammberger's crimes stretched
from 1941 to 1944 during World War II.
   During that time, he served as a Nazi SS boss in the Polish
cities of Krakow and Przemysl, and as commandant of concentration
camps in Rozwadow and Mielec in Poland.
   Since his extradition, Schwammberger has admitted ordering the
execution of one person under ``special circumstances,'' but
otherwise has denied the crimes, Krombacher said.
   Schwammberger was first captured by French soldiers in 1945, in
Innsbruck, Austria. He had with him eight sacks of gold and
jewelry, which allegedly came from his victims, according to
authorities.
   At that time, Schwammberger admitted to having shot to death 27
Jews, Krombacher said.
   Schwammberger escaped while being taken to Salzburg in 1948 and
fled to Argentina, where he lived for almost 40 years until being
found and jailed last year. He was sent to Germany in May.
   Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal once listed Schwammberger among the
10 most-wanted criminals from Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Schwammberger, born in 1912 in what is now the South Tyrol
region of northern Italy, is in Stuttgart's maximum-security
Stammheim prison awaiting trial.
   Several aging Nazi suspects have managed to delay or thwart
various proceedings by claiming poor physical and mental health.
Krombacher said there has been no medical evaluation done to
determine if Schwammberger is competent to stand trial.
   Besides Schwammberger, there are few top Nazi war criminals
still to be brought to justice.
   The No. 1 fugitive is Alois Brunner, who has been living in
Syria, allegedly under protection of the government there.
   German officials in East and West have demanded Brunner's
extradition, so far without succees.

   Zulus fired assault rifles at
Xhosas sleeping in a workers barracks early Monday, leaving 22
people dead and pushing the death toll to 364 in a week of tribal
clashes, police said.
   Zulus and Xhosas, the country's two largest black tribes and
longtime rivals, have been waging vicious battles since Aug. 12 in
the townships surrounding Johannesburg.
   Police and eyewitnesses said Zulus armed with AK-47 rifles
raided a Xhosa workers hostel early Monday in KwaThema township
east of Johannesburg. At least 22 people were killed, many of them
Xhosas shot in their beds, they said.
   Police in armored vehicles moved in after dawn to restore order.
Enraged Xhosas set fire to a hostel used by Zulus before being
driven off.
   Fighting also flared in nearby townships, resulting in several
deaths.
   Looters continued to pillage hostels abandoned by Zulu migrant
workers. People carted away refrigerators, stoves and anything else
they could find.
   Johannesburg newspapers Monday reported five killings Sunday in
the Soweto township by the ``necklace'' method, whereby youths put
gasoline-soaked tires around the necks of victims and set them
alight.
   Police on Monday raised the death toll for the fighting from the
past week to 364 and said hundreds were injured.
   ``We just keep finding bodies. They're everywhere,'' said a
police spokesman.
   The fighting appears to be mostly a tribal conflict with a long
history, but it also has political overtones.
   Nelson Mandela and many other leaders of the African National
Congress, the largest opposition movement, are Xhosas. The ANC's
rival, Inkatha, is a Zulu-based organization headed by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid, the system of racial
segregation that allows 5 million whites to maintain political and
economic control over 30 million blacks. But the two groups differ
over tactics and plans for a future South Africa.
   ANC leader Walter Sisulu ruled out peace talks between Mandela
and Buthelezi, saying it would be a capitulation.
   ``That means Inkatha launches a war in order to bring us to our
knees. For that type of thing we are not prepared,'' he said in a
weekend television interview.
   Mandela's wife, Winnie, warned the ANC may be forced to resume
its armed struggle to protect is supporters. The ANC agreed Aug. 6
to suspend it largely ineffective guerrilla campaign.
   Mrs. Mandela accused the government of ``working hand-in-hand''
with the relatively conservative Inkatha movement in the fighting
against Xhosas, the independent South African Press Association
reported.
   Also, the government has revoked immunity from prosecution for
three ANC leaders, including the head of the group's military wing,
Chris Hani.
   The three men, Hani, Ronnie Kasrils and Mac Maharaj, also are
members of the South African Communist Party, a close ANC ally.
   The government gave no reason for the decision. But it was seen
as a signal that authorities are upset with militant statements
made recently by some ANC leaders.
   The trio are among more than 40 ANC leaders granted temporary
immunity three months ago so they could participate in peace talks.
All but Hani, Kasrils and Maharaj have had their immunity extended
until the end of the year.

<HEAD>Bush Says Americans in Iraq and Kuwait `Are in Fact Hostages'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS new 4th graf, A short... to UPDATE with State
Department reporting Americans taken from hotels in Kuwait</NOTE>

   President Bush demanded today that Iraq release
all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait, saying ``whatever these
innocent people are called, they are in fact hostages.''
   He said a regime that uses civilians as pawns will face the
scorn and condemnation of the entire civilized world.
   As Bush spoke _ for the first time describing the foreigners
under Iraq's Saddam Hussein as hostages _ the official Iraqi News
Agency said some Westerners have been moved to military targets
scattered throughout Iraq for use as shields, to ward of aerial
attacks from American planes and missiles in Saudi Arabia.
   A short time later, the State Department said at least 12
Americans, along with a number of other foreign nationals, were
taken from hotels in Kuwait's capital and moved to undisclosed
locations. Protests were lodged by U.S. diplomats in Kuwait and
Iraq, but the whereabouts of the Americans remained unknown,
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   Bush did not discuss that developments in his speech to the
national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   The State Department, in an indication that the crisis was
widening, advised Americans in Jordan to consider leaving. It
ordered non-essential embassy personnel and dependents to leave
Yemen and urged Americans to defer non-essential travel to both
Jordan and Yemen.
   The State Department cited the ``continuing unstable conditions
in the region'' as the reasons for its decision and also pointed to
anti-American demonstrations in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen.
   In his speech, Bush again compared Saddam to Adolf Hitler and
Saddam's takeover of Kuwait to Hitler's aggression against
neighbors in the 1930s.
   ``A half century ago, the world had the chance of stopping a
ruthless aggressor _ and missed it,'' Bush said, ``and I pledge to
you, we will not make that mistake again.''
   Later, aboard his plane on a flight to a Republican fund-raising
event in Rhode Island, Bush was asked if his use of the term
``hostages'' to describe the interned Westerners was an escalation.
   ``I don't think there's any turning up the heat,'' he told
reporters. ``It's a recognition of the fact that now demands are
being made for the release of people and that, I think, is the
definition of hostages.''
   About 3,000 Americans and thousands of other foreign citizens
now are under Iraqi control, and the Baghdad regime has said some
of them will be held at military sites and other potential U.S.
targets as shields against air attack.
   But Bush said the United States will not be intimidated.
   Dealing with the foreigners denied the right to leave the crisis
zone, Bush told the national VFW:
   ``We have been reluctant to use the term hostage. But when
Saddam Hussain specifically offers to trade the freedom of those
citizens of many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent
people are called, they are in fact hostages.
   ``And I want there to be no misunderstanding. I will hold the
government of Iraq responsible for the safety and well being of
American citizens being held against their will,'' Bush said.
   A scant 12 hours before the Bush address to about 10,000
veterans, his spokesmen had carefully avoided calling the detained
Americans hostages. But Bush dropped the effort, banged the rostrum
and said the government of Iraq is responsible for the safety of
those it holds.
   ``Iraq's invasion was more than a military attack on tiny
Kuwait, it was a ruthless assault on the very essence of
international order and civilized ideals,'' Bush said. ``And now in
a further offense against all norms of international behavior, Iraq
has imposed restrictions on innocent civilians from many
countries.''
   Beyond the demand that Saddam Hussein release the Americans and
others, Bush offered no details about how he would gain their
freedom.
   But he said ``America will not be intimidated,'' and will stand
against aggression.
   Bush flew to Washington Sunday evening to meet with top advisors
on the Persian Gulf crisis, then by Baltimore for the VFW speech.
He was returning to Kennebunkport, Maine, later today, to resume
his vacation.
   The president's VFW appearance was delayed while he talked by
telephone with President Turgut Ozal of Turkey and British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on a trip to the Gulf region,
announced earlier in the day that the United Arab Emirates had
agreed to allow U.S. C-130 cargo transports to operate out of the
moderate Arab federation. Cheney, who made the announcement along
with the president of the Emirates, Sheik Zayed al Nahyan, was
traveling later in the day to Oman and Saudi Arabia to discuss the
U.S. military buildup.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said today ``we have to get enough forces there on the
ground, and really build up enough forces that there can't be any
doubt about it.'' Glenn, appearing on NBC's ``Today'' show, said
``you can't bluff in a situation like this. If he (Saddam) decides
to call our bluff we have to have enough people in there.''
   Bush flew back from Maine on Sunday evening to meet with top
military and civilian national security advisers on the crisis.
   The White House said U.S. warships were still ``shadowing'' two
Iraqi tankers, which ignored warning shots fired by the U.S. ships
on Saturday.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, speaking with reporters aboard
Air Force One on Sunday, said the tankers were still ``several days
out of port. We intend to enforce the sanctions, but we want to
give them every opportunity to turn around and change course.''
   ``Our only concern is that they not offload and violate the
sanctions,'' he said.
   An administration source said, ``There's nothing pushing an
immediate action here. We've stated our intent and many people are
complying with the sanctions voluntarily.'' The official, insisting
on anonymity, also noted that the United Nations is considering
further action to enforce its sanctions.
   Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Robert Kimmitt,
speaking Sunday on NBC, said the State Department was urging
Americans to stay in their homes but not to resist if Iraqi
authorities try to move them.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat,
rejected suggestions that Iraq was violating international norms.
   ``When you deny our children food and milk, what do you
expect?'' he said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.'' He
said the United States should stop ``beating the drums of war'' and
work for peace because ``we are on the brink of a catastrophe for
everybody.''

<HEAD>Start of Magellan's Formal Mapping Mission Delayed Until Sept. 1</HEAD>

   Magellan's mission to map Venus will be
delayed two days while engineers try to figure out why they
temporarily lost touch with the spaceship last week, NASA said
Monday.
   The spacecraft's 243-day mapping mission had been scheduled to
begin Aug. 29, but now will start Sept. 1, said Jim Doyle,
spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The spacecraft already has used its radar to make its first test
pictures of the cloud-covered planet. The laboratory plans to
release those pictures Tuesday. Scientists said last week the
pictures show ``Venusquake''' faults, volcanic cinder cones and old
lava flows.
   Engineers lost touch with Magellan on Thursday for nearly 15
hours just after the spaceship sent those pictures to Earth.
Intermittent contact was restored midday Friday, then steady
communication was re-established Friday night.
   In an attempt to figure out the cause of the problem, engineers
spent the weekend unloading Magellan's memory banks. After that
task was completed Sunday night, the engineers started analyzing
the information to diagnose the malfunction, said Tommy Thompson,
Magellan science manager.
   He said engineers narrowed the cause of the communication
problem to four or five possibilities.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a looping
948 million-mile trip from Earth. It was launched from the space
shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989.
   The $744 million Magellan mission aims to use radar to peer
through Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures yet of the
planet's landscape.

<HEAD>State Department Warns Against Travel to Jordan, Yemen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department advised Americans today
to defer non-essential travel to Jordan in view of the Iraqi
military invasion of Kuwait and ``continuing unstable conditions in
the region.''
   The State Department earlier in the day warned Americans to
defer all non-essential travel to Yemen, citing the Iraqi invasion
and anti-American demonstrations in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen.
Non-essential embassy personnel and dependents were ordered to
leave and all other American citizens who do not have essential
reasons for remaining in Yemen were advised to depart, as well.
   The department said it was permitting non-essential embassy
personnel and dependents to leave Jordan on a voluntary basis. It
advised other Americans in Jordan to consider doing the same.
   Americans living or traveling in Jordan should contact the U.S.
Embassy in Amman to register their presence and receive an update
on the current situation, the department said.
   President Bush met with Jordan's King Hussein in Kennebunkport,
Maine, on Thursday and said Hussein had told him Jordan would
adhere to international economic sanctions against Iraq and close
its key port of Aqaba to goods bound for Iraq.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters he
could not ``cite the specific security factors'' that led to the
travel advisory.
   A U.S. official who spoke on condition he not be identified said
recent demonstrations in Jordan and the country's proximity to Iraq
were factors in the decision.

<HEAD>12 in Kuwait Moved Out of Hotels To Unknown Locations</HEAD>

   At least 12 Americans, along with a number of
other foreign nationals, were taken from hotels in Kuwait's capital
and moved to undisclosed locations, the State Department said today.
   Protests were lodged by U.S. diplomats in Kuwait and Iraq, but
the whereabouts of the Americans remains unknown, spokesman Richard
Boucher said.
   The Americans were staying at the Hyatt, Hilton and
International hotels. They are among an estimated 2,500 Americans
in the Persian Gulf country that was overrun by Iraqi forces three
weeks ago.
   A U.S. official, declining to be identified, said the 12 include
both men and women and at least one family. He said he did not know
if any children were amongGround rules for reporters in the news media
pool supervised by
the Pentagon prohibit disclosure of the exact locations of U.S.
forces here or specific details about the size of deployments.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity over the past
few days, described the Kuwait-directed troop and equipment
movements and planning as routine military procedure.
   ``I don't see us going into Kuwait but if those orders ever came
we would obviously want to be ready,'' one senior U.S. officer in
Saudi Arabia said.
   Said another official: ``If it came down to that, we would have
to move at lightning speed. So obviously you take preliminary steps
to bring up the level of readiness, regardless of the current
plans.''
   The U.S. mission here is described as defensive, and the first
wave of troops and equipment to reach Saudi soil were those that
have trained in such tactics as anti-tank warfare that could be
used to thwart an Iraqi incursion into the Saudi kingdom.
   But in the past few days much of troops and materiel that have
arrived and moved into forward positions have been those considered
generally to be designed for offensive missions.
   These include the beginning elements of the 101st Airborne
Division, an air-assault assault unit which transports its troops
with helicopters, the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, which
includes tanks, heavy artillery and Cobra attack helicopters, and
other ground and naval forces usually geared toward offensive
missions.
   The battleship USS Wisconsin passed through the Suez Canal on
Sunday and is expected to make its way around the Arabian peninsula
into the Persian Gulf, from which it could assist in any offensive
mission. And Marine amphibious forces also are arriving in the
area, according to the officials.
   Other attack-oriented naval forces that are in the area aboard
aircraft carriers include A-6 attack bombers, F-18s and EA-6B
radar-jamming planes designed to foul enemy communications during
combat.
   Still, the United States and other countries participating in
the multinational defense force here are far short of the numbers
military analysts believe would be necessary to mount a ground
effort to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
   There are signs the offensive-oriented buildup is having an
impact on Iraq's strategy.
   Recent U.S. intelligence indicates that while Iraq is
maintaining a formidable force near the Kuwait-Saudi border it
appears to be concentrating more on bolstering troops deployed in a
crescent-shaped line facing the gulf, according to military
officials.
   ``It looks to me that they think the Marines are coming
ashore,'' one officer familiar with intelligence reports said.
Iraq's defense, however, includes strategically placed artillery
and other fire that would make any shore assault particularly
bloody, another American official said.
   The Iraqi shifts appear to have decreased the prospect of an
Iraqi foray in Saudi Arabia, said the officials, who have been
discounting that prospect more and more each day as the U.S. force
multiplies.
   Still en route is more heavy U.S. firepower, including elements
of the 24th Infantry Division, Mechanized, from Georgia, which is
bringing its powerful M1 tanks.
   And troops continue to arrive in large numbers, many aboard
commercial U.S. airliners. Passenger jets from Continental
Airlines, TWA, United Airlines and Northwest Airlines landed at a
Saudi air base Monday carrying U.S. troops and supplies.

   Tom Selleck recalls high school as ``my
glandular days,'' when he was shy and unsure about relations with
girls.
   ``The idea of saving yourself was something noble in the back of
your head, no matter how hard your glands were pushing. I could
never figure out `no.' No meant `I have to say no, but keep trying
'til I can say yes.' And no meant `yes.' I left high school a
virgin,'' he said in the September issue of Fame magazine.
   Selleck said he joined a high school club called the High Hats.
   ``It was a group of guys struggling with puberty. I was kind of
square, but I was with people who definitely weren't,'' he said.
   Selleck says he was ``very shy'' before he eventually got a
steady girlfriend.
   ``I didn't have many dates. I didn't have trouble getting dates
if I got up the nerve to ask. But I had a tendency to run through a
whole relationship before I asked,'' he said.

   The producer of rap stars Public Enemy, L.L.
Cool J, 3rd Bass and others has started his own record label.
   ``I worked at Def Jam and Columbia and I found myself running
between the two companies all the time,'' Hank Shocklee said in a
recent interview with The Associated Press. ``I said if I am going
to be doing all this, I should take care of my own situation, give
artists the attention they needs rather than going through a record
company that has 17 other rap groups.''
   The label is called SOUL (Sound of Urban Listeners) and was
co-founded by former Def Jam promotions man Bill Stephney. Shocklee
says they currently have four acts, including Alva Rogers and Son
of Bazerk, and are negotiating with a fifth.
   ``You really have to have your ears and eyes on the street,''
Shocklee said. ``For example, you might find a crowd of guys
hanging out and go up to them. Everybody that I've signed I've
known for a while. I've been monitoring them, helping them along. I
give them direction, insight and focus in the business.''
   SOUL's debut single, ``Nobody Knows Kelli'' by the Young Black
Teenagers was released Aug. 14.

Cash, and her life has never been the same.
   ``I had a pretty normal time up till then. It was at the height
of his success with the television show and (the hit single) `A Boy
Named Sue,''' recalled Miss Carter. ``We moved to this giant house.
We couldn't mow the yard anymore and instead of getting $1 a week
for allowance, I got $10.
   ``It was a little overwhelming.''
   Miss Carter ran away and got married three years later.
   ``I thought that what I wanted was to live in a trailer and
marry the guy who sacked the groceries at the grocery store,'' she
said. ``It's amazing how romantic you think a trailer can be.''
   Miss Carter began writing songs a short time later.
   ``My mom said if you can write a classic song, a standard,
you're set for life. For many years, I never considered myself a
singer. I considered myself a songwriter,'' she said.
   Miss Carter, now 34, has a new Warner Bros. Records album ``I
Fell in Love'' due out Tuesday, her first after a five-year rest.

   A movie about Claus von Bulow won't reveal
whether the Danish socialite lawyer tried to kill his heiress wife,
Sunny, but that hasn't stopped the actor who played von Bulow from
sympathizing with him.
   ``Acting a part is like a detective story. You're following
clues. I've just got this gut feeling about many of the things von
Bulow did. Finally you work out a hypothesis and all the clues just
drop in. And you think: That's it,'' said actor Jeremy Irons.
   The movie, ``Reversal of Fortune,'' is based on the book by von
Bulow's appeal lawyer, Alan Dershowitz. Von Bulow's 1982 conviction
in Rhode Island on two counts of assault with intent to kill his
wife with an injection of insulin was overturned after an appeal
and second trial in 1985.
   ``I think Claus is actually much more a victim of that trial
than Sunny,'' Irons told Fame magazine in its September issue.
``They claim Sunny was the victim and that her life was opened up
for public scrutiny. Well, so was Claus von Bulow's and he's alive.
Sunny, at least, is in a coma.''
   Irons said the film, co-starring Glenn Close, would keep people
arguing about von Bulow's guilt or innocence.

   Three former Northwest Airlines pilots were
found guilty today of flying while intoxicated, the first
convictions under a new federal law cracking down on drinking and
drug use in commercial transportation.
   A federal jury convicted former pilots Norman Lyle Prouse, 51,
of Conyers, Ga.; Robert Kirchner, 36, of Highland Ranch, Colo.; and
Joseph Balzer, 35, of Antioch, Tenn.
   The felony charge carries a maximum 15 years in prison and
$250,000 fine. Sentencing will not be decided until authorities
complete a pre-sentence investigation.
   ``I came into this expecting the worst. In that sense I had no
surprise,'' said Prouse after the verdicts were announced. In his
defense, he had argued that he was an alcoholic and thus had a
higher tolerance for alcohol than most people. His lawyer said he
would appeal.
   The three were arrested March 8 after flying a Boeing 727 from
Fargo, N.D., to the Twin Cities. The plane, carrying 91 passengers,
landed safely.
   Witnesses said they consumed numerous drinks at a bar several
hours before the early morning flight.
   In tests about two hours after the plane arrived at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, Kirchner showed a
blood-alcohol concentration of 0.06 percent; Balzer showed 0.08
percent and Prouse 0.13 percent.
   Prouse was the captain on the flight, Kirchner the first officer
and Balzer the flight engineer.
   The pilots had been drinking the night before at a lounge in
Moorhead and a customer reported them to the Federal Aviation
Administration, according to undisputed trial testimony.
   According to bills from the bar introduced as evidence, Prouse
ordered 15 rum and colas while Kirchner and Balzer shared seven
pitchers of beer over about six hours.
   An FAA official came to the airport, but the plane left while he
was telephoning a supervisor to see what to do. Another FAA
official made a citizen's arrest when the plane landed at
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Defense lawyers argued that the apparently smooth operation of
the 40-minute flight showed that the pilots were not impaired by
alcohol.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega questioned
whether the pilots could have handled an emergency if one had
developed.
   ``The law does not require that we have to wait for a tragedy to
happen before we find someone guilty,'' she told the jury.
   Northwest fired the pilots for violating the company's 12-hour
prohibition against drinking before flying, and the FAA revoked
their licenses. The FAA prohibits flying within eight hours of
drinking and prohibits pilots from flying with blood-alcohol
concentrations of 0.04 percent or more.
   The trial opened July 25, and jurors got the case on Thursday.
   The federal law providing criminal penalties for operation of a
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol or drugs was
adopted in 1986 and amended in 1988. Besides planes, the law
applies to commercial boats, trains and passenger-carrying buses.
   Prior to enactment of the law, pilots were covered only by FAA
regulations; there were no federal criminal penalties for flying
while intoxicated.
   The law states that an individual with a blood-alcohol content
of 0.10 percent or more shall be presumed to be under the influence
of alcohol, but it does not state flatly that that percentage makes
a person automatically guilty.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum told jurors that they had to
decide whether a defendant ``is so affected by an alcoholic
beverage that the person does not possess that clearness of
intellect and control of himself as he otherwise would.''

   Leonard and Julie Laczkowski's wedding day was
all wet, and so were some of the guests.
   After a heavy rain storm, Laczkowski awoke Saturday, his wedding
day, to find his father's front yard under 3 feet of water.
   Luckily, his father had a 12-foot rowboat, so Laczkowski kept
his tuxedo dry by rowing about 175 feet to a waiting limousine.
   The real fun began after the wedding when about 125 guests
returned to the house for a reception, Laczkowski said.
   ``Some of them cut through the neighbors' yards, where it was
drier, or else they took the rowboat trip,'' he said.
   A few people decided to drive through the water to the area
where the reception was held, he said. ``But those that did ended
up with water in their back seats,'' he said.
   ``My mother's car died trying to make it through, and then she
made the mistake of opening the door. That's when the water came.''
Her gown was ruined, he said.
   Laczkowski said the water didn't put much of a damper on the
celebration.
   ``By the time we all got up here, it was kind of funny. I don't
think too many of them ever went to a wedding where the groom
pushed them across in a boat,'' he said. ``I was pushing the boat
in a tuxedo with my pants rolled up. I looked like Huckleberry
Finn.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's crime capital got a new police chief
Monday: Eldrin Bell, a flamboyant cop with a reputation for
cracking heads.
   In Atlanta, No. 1 in the FBI's big-city crime statistics two
years running, Bell's appointment by Mayor Maynard Jackson is a
popular one.
   ``Let the word go forth,'' Bell said at a news conference
announcing his appointment. ``Lawlessness and drug trafficking and
gangs are not welcome in Atlanta. Atlanta will not tolerate this
kind of lawlessness.''
   Jackson said Bell has a ``well deserved reputation as a tough
cop'' and ``is exactly what the doctor ordered.''
   ``We need someone who is going to kick butts,'' said City
Council President Marvin Arrington.
   Arrington took the unusual step of announcing that the City
Council saw no need for confirmation hearings.
   Bell, who succeeds the retiring Chief Morris Redding, is slated
to be the city's most powerful police chief in nearly 20 years. The
position of public safety commissioner, installed over the police
and fire chiefs in 1974, was eliminated by Jackson this year.
   Bell, 54, has most recently served a third tour as deputy chief.
The first two ended in demotions.
   In 1979, he was busted to major during an investigation of
police protection for gamblers at a fairgrounds where Bell worked
security. No charges were filed, and he was reinstated.
   In 1985, he was demoted to lieutenant after he was among the
patrons at a swank Italian restaurant where the invited guests were
targets of an FBI drug-theft sting. It turned out that Bell hadn't
been invited and wasn't a target of the FBI.
   Despite the controversy, Bell has made a name for himself as a
take-charge cop. He once reportedly picked up a billy club, phoned
for an ambulance, entered a crowded bar and fought seven suspects
into submission. He was investigated in 1984 for pistol-whipping a
motorist he had stopped, but a civilian panel, a police board and a
federal judge later cleared him of using excessive force.
   As commander of the city's crime-ridden Zone 3, he was known for
patrolling streets himself in the middle of the night and for
popping in unannounced at headquarters to make sure the night shift
was answering calls promptly.
   He takes over a police department that by many accounts, has its
hands full. Atlanta reported 210 serious crimes for each 1,000
residents in 1989 _ worst among the nation's cities of 300,000 or
more, according to the FBI. It was the second straight year the
city had the dubious distinction.
   Redding stepped down last month after eight years as chief.

   Israel's Supreme Court issued a temporary
injunction Monday against construction of a Voice of America relay
station planned for the southern Arava desert.
   The injunction was requested by the Nature Preservation Society,
which contends that the station could interfere with bird migration
routes and cause environmental damage.
   The government's National Planning Board initially voted that
construction of the VOA project should be delayed for two years to
allow for a bird migration study.
   The board reversed itself last month and agreed to immediate
construction after U.S. Ambassador William Brown sent a note to
Communications Minister Rafael Pinhasi, stressing the importance
Washington attaches to the project.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Eti Eshed said a three-judge panel
of the Supreme Court issued the injunction and ordered the
government to respond within 45 days on why the project should be
allowed to proceed.
   The relay station is to transmit VOA broadcasts to Eastern
Europe and Africa.

<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has frayed
nerves, strained alliances and caused gnawing worries about the
future. It has also spawned a lot of jokes about Saddam Hussein,
the Iraqi leader who started it all.
   The humor helps take the edge off the fear.
   In a Bahrain cafe, an Egyptian pulled up a chair and made the
habitual gestures of looking left and right to make sure no secret
police were around.
   Then he poked fun at the Iraqi president's reputation for
ruthlessness.
   ``The other night Saddam reprimanded his son for his poor
English. He asked if the boy neaded a private tutor, and the boy
named one,'' he began.
   ``Saddam picked up the phone and issued the order: `Bring along
that English language teacher, Ibrahim Ramadan.' Ten hours later,
Saddam phoned again and yelled, `Where is that teacher? I ordered
you to get him!'
   ``The intelligence chief replied: `We did, Mr. President. The
man confessed and we executed him.''
   Large numbers of Egyptians work in the Persian Gulf region,
drawn by its oil wealth. The crisis sparked by Saddam's Aug. 2
conquest of Kuwait has given them a chance to indulge in a favorite
pastime _ making acid jokes about petty tyrants.
   Their gibes at Saddam circulate fast in the banking and business
center of Bahrain, an island state of 400,000 people.
   For the Egyptians in the region, the jokes can help them forget
their own country's risky role in the crisis.
   Their president, Hosni Mubarak, led Arab efforts to settle the
crisis without outside intervention. When Saddam spurned his
efforts, Mubarak sent troops to join the multinational force
arrayed against Iraq in Saudi Arabia.
   Saddam, who took power in 1979, rules Iraq with an iron hand,
with a powerful security apparatus to keep his citizens in check.
   The 54-year-old leader is also at the center of a pervasive
personality cult. Iraqi newspapers, television and radio constantly
sing his praises. Even children's nursery rhymes hail Saddam.
   In the small oil-rich states of the gulf _ states not so
different from Kuwait _ Saddam is also looming large these days.
   Cafe patrons have stopped playing backgammon and dominoes.
Instead, they huddle around transistor radios and listen to
newscasts, smoking their water pipes and sipping heavy desert
coffee.
   The Egyptian cafe-goer bent over a group of Arabs and said in a
serious tone: ``Have you heard the latest?'' His audience tensed
up, waiting to hear about a fresh political or military development
in the crisis.
   ``The U.N. delegates from Egypt, Sudan and Iraq were asked what
was their opinion about eating meat,'' said the storyteller. ``The
Egyptian asked `What's meat?' The Sudanese asked `What's eating?'
and the Iraqi asked `What is opinion?''
   There was a burst of laughter, prompting others to walk up and
demand a repeat.
   No repeats, said the Egyptian. A joke is good only at the first
hearing.
   ``Please sit down, I'll buy you a cup of tea,'' an Arab in a
flowing dishdasha gown and kaffiyeh headgear entreated him. ``Let's
have more.''

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Require Controversial Treadmill Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people with heart problems might
no longer qualify for federal disability pay under a Bush
administration proposal to expand the use of a controversial
exercise test.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., and New York state officials contend the
tests, which require pedaling a bicycle or walking on a treadmill,
could be unfairly used to exclude deserving applicants.
   ``There can be no question that in this day of mammoth federal
deficits, even minimal savings are appreciated,'' Heinz said. ``But
to create savings by distorting congressional intent is
unacceptable and a blatant disregard for the public interest.''
   The government estimates it will save $30 million in the plan's
first year, and $220 million a year by 1995. Plans for the testing
program are still being finalized and would be subject to public
comment.
   The Social Security Administration receives 195,000 disability
applications a year based on heart problems. If the proposal went
into effect, the agency said, cardiovascular benefits would drop as
much as 5 percent and thousands of people would lose eligibility if
the tests showed the applicants weren't sufficiently disabled.
   SSA already uses the procedure in many cases to gauge the
severity of heart disorders, but the proposed regulations would
require a treadmill test for every disability benefit applicant
with heart disease who could safely undergo one.
   Under the proposal, applicants would qualify for Social Security
disability payments averaging $560 a month only if the ailment is
deemed serious enough to prevent them from working.
   Heinz, ranking Republican on the Special Committee on Aging,
told SSA in a letter last month that the proposal violated
individuals' rights to have their cases fully heard.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said in a prepared
statement he was concerned that ``the federal government will
continue to place predominant emphasis on the treadmill test in the
face of other reliable medical evidence.''
   The test would be the ``primary, though not exclusive basis''
for evaluating whether people with heart problems can work, SSA
Commissioner Gwendolyn King said in a February memorandum to Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.
   SSA wants the change despite a federal appeals court ruling in
June that upheld a New York federal court ruling forbidding the
agency from denying benefits based solely on the treadmill test
when other evidence was available.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the test often fails
to detect one of the most common cardiovascular disorders, known as
ischemia. Evidence showed that the treadmill test resulted in
misdiagnosis of ischemic heart disease more than one-third of the
time, the court said.
   ``An individual who does not show signs of heart disease during
a treadmill test may still be severely disabled from ischemia,''
the court said. ``False assessments may occur because treadmill
testing does not consider the full range of stresses and exertions
that arise at the workplace or in daily living.''
   More than 5 million Americans have the disorder, which accounts
for 60 percent of all heart ailments and is characterized by
narrowing of the arteries and chest pain.
   The administration may ask the court to reconsider, said SSA
spokesman Phil Gambino.
   ``We disagree with the court's decision because we believe that
even currently we won't use the test in exclusion of other medical
evidence,'' Gambino said in an interview last week.
   People already receiving benefits would be affected only if a
treadmill test demonstrated that their condition had improved since
their initial claim.

<TEXT>
   Doug Gauss' office is a Dodge van with a
camera and microphone mounted on the dash. His mission is to
produce a video inventory of Florida's entire road system _ all
23,000 miles.
   ``Actually it's 11,500 miles, but I drive it in both
directions,'' said Gauss, who takes three years to log every mile
of every road maintained by the state.
   And when he's done, it's time to start again.
   Videotaping roads is Gauss' full-time job with the Florida
Department of Transportation's Roadway Characteristics Inventory
Section.
   His work is housed in Tallahassee, where it serves as a
reference library for road scholars.
   Engineers and planners check out videos to inspect a stretch of
pavement without ever leaving their offices. Department lawyers can
take a tape to court to support their cases.
   The county roads, city roads, expressways, interstates and all
of the Florida Turnpike add up to a viewing time of 600 hours.
That's a 25-day trip without leaving the couch. Viewer discretion
is advised.
   ``Don't bother burning the popcorn,'' said Steve Homan, a
spokesman in the department's DeLand office. ``They are perhaps the
most boring things you'll ever see in your life.''
   But it's a work of love for Gauss, who became the video logger
in 1987.
   ``I always wanted this job,'' he said last week while taping the
Orange Blossom Trail in Orlando.
   His annual salary is not much more than the total mileage he
racks up every three years, and he earns it the hard way: on the
road five days a week, 26 weeks a year, driving and taping, taping
and narrating, up one side of a road and down the other, all by his
lonesome.
   He hates offices and calls the entire state ``my hometown.''
   One regret is the 100 nights a year he spends in motels, away
from his Tallahassee home and his wife of eight years.
   ``That's the downside,'' he said, ``but she knows how miserable
I am in the office.''
   He expects to complete his second tour of Florida roads in
March. After that, he is intrigued by a proposal to tape Florida's
rail lines.
   ``I think I'd like to see rails,'' Gauss said. ``It would be a
nice change.''

<HEAD>B.F. Skinner Recalled as Brilliant Thinker, Warm Friend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Psychology pioneer B.F. Skinner applied his
theories of behavior modification to his own life, a friend
recalled Monday as tributes poured in for the man who died last
weekend.
   Skinner invented a reward system for himself to speed his
learning of French grammar, said Ted Blau. He would study the verbs
on an exercise treadmill, and give himself a break when he got
something right.
   ``Fred was never a man to let things go to waste,'' said Blau.
Blau, a clinical psychologist in Tampa, Fla., became friends with
Skinner after meeting him in 1973.
   Skinner, the father of behavioral psychology and a professor
emeritus at Harvard University, died Saturday at Mount Auburn
Hospital in Cambridge after battling leukemia. He was 86.
   His theories bore the cold, clinical edge of laboratory tests,
but friends and colleagues remembered him as a warm and gentle man
who believed that human beings are just another organism shaped by
their environment.
   Critics say many of Skinner's ideas were inhumane, but
supporters point out that he left his mark on treatment methods to
improve the lives of the mentally ill, drug addicts and others.
   His death elicited emotional responses from friends and
supporters.
   ``I was kind of teary all day yesterday,'' said Jack Michael,
who teaches psychology at Western Michigan University. ``It's just
kind of the end of a period that was important to all of us.''
   Skinner experimented with pigeons and rats to show that systems
of rewards and punishment could shape animal behavior. He taught
pigeons to play ping pong by reinforcing behavior patterns.
   The practical application of Skinner's theories can be seen in
popular programs to help people lose weight, stop smoking and
toilet train children.
   ``Skinner for many of us is a person of the same status, who has
the same impact on the understanding of behavior that Darwin had in
the area of biology or that Newton had in the area of physics,''
Michael said.
   Charles Darwin postulated the modern theory of evolution, and
Sir Isaac Newton formulated the laws of gravity and motion.
   Fred Keller, 91, a psychologist retired from Columbia
University, first met Skinner in 1928 when they were graduate
students at Harvard.
   ``I first thought he was just a brilliant student whom I
liked,'' said Keller, who lives in Chapel Hill, N.C.
   ``He was widely read,'' Keller said. ``He was clearly a highly
intellectual and highly intelligent young man, and that was
apparent from the first. I think all of his classmates at Harvard
recognized that he was an outstanding scientist.''
   William McKeachie, professor of psychology at University of
Michigan, said he exchanged many letters with Skinner and sharply
disagreed with his views.
   ``But we were friends,'' McKeachie said. ``He asked me to review
one of his last manuscripts.''
   Skinner's theories have had a major effect on education and the
running of mental hospitals and prisons, he said.
   Skinner developed ``token economies,'' in which people in
institutions could earn rewards by good behavior and meeting goals.
   Teachers learned to pay more attention to classroom techniques,
which could affect how students behave and learn.
   Skinner was honored one week ago for his lifetime of achievement
by the American Psychological Association at their convention in
Boston.
   He was nominated many times to be president of the APA, but
turned it down, said Blau, a former APA president.
   ``He did not believe that psychologists serious about their work
should be distracted by political ins and outs.''

<TEXT>
   High school students ignored black protesters
and ``KKK'' painted on a front door Monday as they began another
school year in the city's racially troubled school system.
   The schools were closed five days last spring because of
protests over the firing of the district's first black
superintendent. Protesters also criticized the white-majority
school board, the mayor and the placement of students.
   Police made no arrests Monday. James Carter, acting school
superintendent, said the school year got off to a peaceful start
despite the overnight vandalism and the protest at Selma High
School.
   About 30 blacks chanted outside the school as students arrived
and two carried stuffed effigies of black children marked with
slogans such as ``I'm Not Of Lesser Intelligence'' and ``Just Give
Me An Equal Chance.''
   Rose Sanders, a black lawyer and leader of the protest, contends
poor students _ black and white _ are funneled into lower-level
classes designed to perpetuate underachievement and are not
encouraged to take college preparatory classes, such as chemistry,
biology and foreign languages.
   Carter, who is black, said there was ``no tracking'' of students
in their course assignments. He said students are ``grouped'' in
some subjects, based on performance.
   For the system's 11 schools, officials reported enrollment
Monday at 5,012 students _ 3,983 black and 1,029 white.
   After protests began in December, about 300 students _ mostly
white _ left the public school system to enroll in private schools
or moved, leaving between 5,700 and 5,800 students at the end of
the school year, Carter said.
   Karen Felts, a white senior, said the attention attracted by the
protests is ``an embarrassment.'' Miss Felts said the long-running
protest ``has changed the spirit of the people'' at the school.
   ``I'm just going to try to get through it the best I can,'' she
said. ``School is what you make it.''

<TEXT>
   Richard L. Strout, who reported on Washington
during 12 administrations and skewered the mighty as a liberal
columnist, has died. He was 92.
   Strout died Sunday night at Georgetown University Medical
Center. Godfrey Sperling, his longtime colleague at the Christian
Science Monitor, said Strout was hospitalized after an Aug. 8 fall.
   Strout reported for the Monitor from 1922 to 1984, for the first
couple of years at the newspaper's home office in Boston and then
in its Washington bureau. He wrote about presidents from Warren G.
Harding to Ronald Reagan.
   From 1943 to 1983, he wrote the political column ``TRB from
Washington'' in the New Republic magazine. The column was also
syndicated to newspapers.
   As a columnist, Strout described the Eisenhower administration
as ``government by sedative,'' likened Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy,
R-Wis., to ``a mist that carries lethal contagion'' and said
then-Vice President Richard Nixon was ``out for the kill and the
scalp at any cost.''
   As a reporter, he covered presidential political campaigns and
conventions, the Teapot Dome scandal that rocked the Harding
administration, Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, and the
D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944.
   The TRB column was written anonymously for years, by Kenneth
Crawford and others and then by Strout. It is currently written by
Michael Kinsley, a senior editor of the magazine, and carries his
byline.
   When Strout gave up the column, the editors of the magazine
wrote: ``You don't get out of Strout's church without hearing the
sermon, but the hymns are lovely. ... He looks and listens, and
tells you what he has seen and heard in vivid, simple words.''
   The column's name was coined by Bruce Bliven, an editor of the
New Republic before it moved from New York to Washington. Bliven
carried copy to the office by subway and said the initials were
those of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit in reverse.
   After Strout's retirement, his name remained on the magazine's
masthead as a contributing editor.
   In 1978, Strout was given a special citation by the Pulitzer
Prize committee for his lifetime achievement. Strout also won the
George Polk Memorial Award in 1958 and the National Press Club's
Fourth Estate Award in 1975, among others.
   Strout was born in Cohoes, N.Y., and raised in Brooklyn. His
father was an English teacher who wrote poetry. His parents both
lived into their 90s.
   After graduating from Harvard in 1919, he worked his way across
the Atlantic on a grain ship and served an apprenticeship as a
reporter and copy editor for English newspapers. After returning to
the United States in 1921, he worked briefly as a reporter for the
Boston Post before joining the Monitor.
   He was the author of ``TRB: Views and Perspectives on the
Presidency,'' a collection of columns published in 1979, and
co-author with E.B. White of a book-length essay on the Ford Model
T automobile, published in 1936.
   Strout is survived by his wife, Ernestine; their two children,
Elizabeth Zimmerman of Minneapolis and Mary Rubeiz of Geneva,
Switzerland; and three children from a previous marriage, Alan
Mayne Strout of Weston, Mass., Phyllis Norris of Santa Cruz,
Calif., and Nancy Dulaney of Washington. Survivors also include 11
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Strout's first wife,
Edith Mayne, died in 1932.
   A private funeral is planned.

<HEAD>Families Already Knew What Bush Concedes: Their Relatives Are
Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday made official what the Rev. Edwin Davis
and his wife, Irene, have sensed for nearly three weeks. Their
daughter, and thousands of other Americans, are hostages.
   ``What happens if there's a shooting war?'' asked the retired
minister from Koran, La. ``I'd like to be over there with them ...
hold my daughter's hand.''
   But the 68-year-old diabetic can't join ``the military soldier
boys'' digging in for a long Persian Gulf standoff. Neither can he
do anything to drive away the images haunting him and families
around the nation.
   At night, while he tries to rest, Davis feels the heat he
imagines his daughter, Kuwaiti son-in-law and their two teen-age
children feel.
   He hears the helicopters that buzzed in the background the last
time she called home, the night Iraqi troops rumbled into Kuwait.
   Since the Aug. 2 invasion, scant news has reached the relatives
of about 3,000 Americans caught in Iraq's tightening grip. State
Department officials have contacted some U.S. families. Others are
still awaiting word.
   Jean Pryor is among the luckier relatives. Through a circuitous
route, a message from her daughter in Kuwait made it home to
Pelham, Ala. It said, simply: ``I'm fine. I don't think I'm in
danger. They have moved me from the city to another province.''
   Pryor, who isn't sure who ``they'' are, said the brief
reassurance came ``at just the right time ... was an answer to the
prayers that have gone out.'' But that message is now nearly a week
old. Tensions have escalated.
   Iraq's official news agency said Monday that Western detainees
had been moved to vital military targets, apparently to be used as
human shields against a potential American attack. The government
also has warned that those who hide foreigners will face the
``severest punishment.''
   ``We have been reluctant to use the term hostage,'' Bush told
the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Baltimore.
   ``But when Saddam Hussein specifically offers to trade the
freedom of those citizens of many nations he holds against their
will in return for concessions, there can be little doubt that ...
they are in fact hostages.''
   ``That's what I've said for two weeks,'' said Marjorie
Walterscheid of Jacksboro, Texas. Her husband, Rainard, 52, is
among a group of 35 U.S. citizens transferred from a Baghdad hotel
to an undisclosed location. ``I've felt all the time they were
hostages.''
   Semantics mean little to Scott Gerard of New Harmony, Ind. All
he knows is that his sister-in-law could lose her baby.
   Joan Khaja, who is seven months pregant, suffered complications
before she traveled to Kuwait in late July to visit her husband's
relatives. Now family members fear her body may not tolerate the
dueling stresses of 100-degree desert heat and chilling uncertainty.
   ``It seems like (officials) have been so cautious not to use the
term `hostage' all along,'' Gerard said. ``But ... I don't think it
makes any difference at all.''
   ``I don't think there's anything we can do ... (but) hope that
there won't be another war, that our loved ones won't die in
vain,'' said Palma Sharpan, whose nephew worked for American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. in Kuwait for the past 15 years.
   The prospect of war holds anxious relatives hostage. In a
windowless room at the State Department in Washington, D.C.,
consular officers take about 4,000 calls a day from people trying
to locate missing family members.
   ``We live by the TV now,'' said Lynda Parker of Vidor, Texas.
``I live with a telephone in one hand and the remote control in the
other.'' Her husband, Bobby, 49, is a Kuwait Petroleum Co. worker
missing since the invasion.
   ``It's with me all the time,'' said Pryor, whose daughter has
had two children since she moved from Alabama to Kuwait three years
ago.
   ``I get up very early in the mornings so that by the time the
news goes off at night, my body goes to sleep,'' she said Monday.
   ``But my heart is still awake. It never sleeps.''

   Electricity has been restored to all but one
business a week after a fire destroyed an electrical substation and
knocked out power to 1,600 customers, utility officials said Monday.
   The outage blackened a 30-block area surrounding the South
Street Seaport in downtown Manhattan Aug. 13, initially trapping
thousands of people in elevators and offices in Wall Street
skyscrapers.
   Buildings affected included the World Trade Center and the World
Financial Center. Power was restored to them late that day.
   Consolidated Edison said the last 25 percent of the affected
customers had their power turned back on sometime Sunday or early
Monday.
   The lone business customer who was not yet connected was
operating on a backup generator and had asked the utility to delay
switching the power on until after the business day.

   A man convicted in the fatal shootings of
two black joggers 10 years ago Monday has finally admitted his
guilt.
   Joseph Paul Franklin, an avowed racist, admitted in a television
interview he killed the two men in a city park Aug. 20, 1980.
   Ted Fields, 20, and David Martin, 18, were felled in a sniper
attack as they ran with two white girls. The gunman was hidden in a
field nearby.
   In an interview with KUTV from the federal prison in Marion,
Ill., Franklin initially refused to answer questions about the
murders.
   An hour into the interview, which was broadcast Sunday night,
Franklin was asked again about the murders. ``The answer is yes. I
won't discuss it any further other than to say yes,'' he said.
   Pressed to supply the one answer sought by Martin's mother,
Franklin added a short time later, ``Just for her, just to answer
her question, I'll say that it was just because they were race
mixing. Had they not been race mixing, you know, it would have been
a totally different story.''
   Franklin, 39, a drifter from Mobile, Ala., and a past member of
the Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party, is serving four life
terms for the slayings of Martin and Fields _ two state murder
convictions and two federal convictions for violating the victims'
civil rights.
   He had blamed the convictions on the Mormon Church and
government officials, who he charged were offended by his blunt
racial statements.
   His name later was linked to 13 slayings across the United
States, as well as the shootings of National Urban League President
Vernon Jordan and Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt.
   He was acquitted in the Jordan shooting in 1982 and was indicted
but never tried in the Flynt case. In 1984, he was convicted of
bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tenn., and in 1986 received two
more life sentences for murdering an interracial couple in Madison,
Wis.
   Though he claims to spend most of his time in prison reading the
Bible and praying, Franklin expresses no remorse for the Utah
murders.
   ``No, I don't regret that. Not to say there are not actions that
I've done that I don't regret. I've sinned a lot in my life. Any
sins that I've done I've repented of,'' he said.

   The Marines are ``damn confident'' they can
cope with any situation here, despite the punishing conditions and
logistical challenges, a commanding general said Monday.
   ``We are ready to do whatever we need to do,'' Maj. Gen. John
Hopkins, head of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade based in
Twentynine Palms, Calif., said in an interview with reporters.
   So far, about 90 percent of the equipment the brigade needs has
arrived in Saudi Arabia, he said. ``We're not battle-ready right
this moment, but we'll be ready pretty shortly,'' Hopkins said.
   Although the brigade trained in the Mojave Desert, Hopkins said
even he was overwhelmed by the Arabian desert conditions, where
temperatures routinely hit 130 degrees.
   ``We are going through growing pains, and all the troops are
getting acclimatized,'' he said. Even so, he said: ``We feel damn
confident.''
   The equipment the brigade has brought with it will enable the
Marines to fight on land and in the air.
   The brigade has carried weapons for every wartime situation,
including: M-60 tanks, high utility multipurpose vehicles;
howitzers; TOW missiles; 40mm grenade launchers; Harrier jets;
Cobra helicopters equipped with sidewinder missiles and TOWs; Huey
helicopters for command and control; CH-46 _ so-called Sea Knights
_ to transport people, and wide-bellied C-150 transport planes.
   All told, five cargo ships _ some based in the Indian Ocean
island of Diego Garcia _ will unload material for the brigade. Most
of the equipment, including the helicopters, has to be reasembled
on the ground.
   The brigade _ a so-called maritime preposition brigade _ has
deployed in a commercial port and surrounding desert in the eastern
province of Saudi Arabia.
   For security reasons, the Defense Department has barred
reporters from disclosing specific information such as the number
of Marines in Saudi Arabia, their location and the number of
weapons they carrying.
   But a brigade typically has about 16,500 men. Pentagon officials
have said as many as 45,000 Marines could end up in the desert
kingdom.
   Expeditionary units are designed to become combat-capable in 10
days and sustain itself for 30 days without resupply.
   The ground combat Marines have been sent to the desert where
they have set up tents covered by camoflauged nettings to escape
the sun and avoid detection from above.
   Aviators and maintenance crews are working 16 hours to 18 hours
a day to ready their craft learn the terrain.

<TEXT>
   It's neither Santa the Claus nor Easter the
bunny, and after four decades of being misidentified, another
cultural icon wants it known that he, too, has no middle name.
   It's simply Smokey Bear, said the Ad Council, which helped
create the ursine forest ranger in 1944.
   The council has launched a national advertising campaign to
eliminate the ``the'' that's usually attached to the name of the
bear best known for reminding that ``only you can prevent forest
fires.''
   The Ad Council has added a reminder about the bear's name to a
new $1.6 million fire prevention campaign.
   In a 60-second radio spot made available nationwide last month,
a boy teaches the bear's name to a man who says he's said Smokey
the Bear his whole life.
   ``You wouldn't call the Easter bunny `Easter `the' bunny, would
you?'' the boy responds.
   Smokey was born after the U.S. Forest Service sought help from
the Ad Council in designing a fire prevention campaign. The
national council is a non-profit organization that helps develop
public service advertising.
   The first Smokey Bear was a human dressed in a costume. In 1950,
a bear cub saved from a New Mexico forest fire was named Smokey and
exhibited at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C.
   He died in 1976, and was replaced by Smokey II, another
forest-fire orphan who died earlier this month of liver cancer.

<HEAD>Iran Says It Will Abide By U.N. Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran on Monday said it will abide by U.N.
sanctions against Iraq, despite the newly established peace between
the two neighboring Persian Gulf states.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency, in a report monitored
in Nicosia, said Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
informed U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the
decision in a letter sent Monday.
   ``Iran, as a member of the United Nations, will honor Resolution
661 issued by the U.N. Security Council within the capacities
stipulated by the U.N. Charter,'' IRNA quoted Velayati as telling
the U.N. chief.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced last week that he had
accepted Iran's terms for a settlement of the decade-old conflict,
pacifying his eastern neighbor as his confrontation escalated with
U.S.-led forces in Saudi Arabia and the gulf region.
   He began withdrawing troops from occupied Iranian territories on
Friday, and the two sides have since exchanged thousands of
prisoners captured in the 1980-88 war.
   Saddam's peace initiative raised speculation Iran would violate
the mandatory sanctions called by the U.N. Security Council after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the subsequent annexation
of the small gulf emirate.
   The foreign ministers of Turkey and Pakistan, both staunch
allies of the West, traveled to Iran last weekend, seeking
commitment from Velayati to the sanctions.
   Iran has condemned the invasion and called for an Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait. But it said it was equally opposed to the
deployment of U.S.-led multinational forces in Saudi Arabia.
   It called for the withdrawal of these forces, which assembled in
the kingdom to thwart a possible Iraqi attack from the north,
saying developments in Kuwait were best solved by countries of the
region.

   A woman safely landed a private plane after
her husband, the pilot, died at the controls.
   Joan S. Bailey, of Trotwood, Ohio, radioed the Delaware County
Airport on Sunday afternoon that her husband had collapsed. All
runways were closed and radio traffic controllers talked her
through the safe landing.
   ``She did a wonderful job,'' said Fire Chief Tommy Crawford.
   ``It was hard for us to believe. She looked like she just set it
down in a field of cotton.''
   Mrs. Bailey's husband, Robert E. Bailey, 48, apparently suffered
a heart attack, officials said. He was pronounced dead at Ball
Memorial Hospital.
   The Baileys were en route from Dayton, Ohio, to Muncie in a
single-engine Grumman American Tiger. Mrs. Bailey, whose age wasn't
available, told investigators she did not know how to fly the plane.

<TEXT>
   At odds with President Bush and half the
Arab world, King Hussein is persevering in his attempts to be a
peacemaker in the Persian Gulf, but his position is precarious.
   Since Hussein assumed the throne in 1952 at age 16, he has
managed to endure, despite being at the vortex of the political
upheavals that have plagued the Middle East. But his support for
Iraq's president following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has
left Hussein vulnerable.
   The crisis threatens Jordan's ``very social and political
stability,'' leading economist Fahed Fanek wrote in the
English-language Jordan Times newspaper on Sunday.
   The king has refused to join Egypt, Syria and other Arab states
that have sent troops _ even if they are primarily token
contingents _ to join the Western buildup in Saudi Arabia against
Iraq.
   Hussein says he cannot participate if he is to pursue his
efforts for a settlement ``within an Arab context without outside
intervention.''
   Western diplomats in Amman said Hussein has shown a genuine
desire to avert a potentially catastrophic military showdown in the
gulf.
   But if he joins the forces against Iraq's president, Saddam
Hussein, he risks the wrath of his powerful neighbor. He also faces
an internal threat. Jordan's 3 million people have rallied behind
Saddam, whom many Arabs consider the only leader willing to stand
up to Israel and the United States.
   More than 100,000 Jordanians have registered as volunteers to
fight for Iraq if war breaks out, according to the Jordanian
Committee for the Support of Iraq.
   But if Hussein supports the Iraqi leader, he is certain to face
the Jewish state's military might and the revulsion of the
international community.
   Dan Shueftan, a researcher at Israel's Hebrew University, said
the king ``is walking between the devil and the deep blue sea.''
   Another Israeli, Ron Ben-Ishai, military commentator for the
daily Yediot Ahronot, justified Hussein's concern over Israeli
intentions.
   ``They're worried about a possible Israeli preemptive strike,''
he said.
   Jordan is Saddam's main avenue for confronting Israel on the
ground. Israel's hard-line government has warned it will attack if
the Iraqis enter Jordan.
   Hussein has expressed discouragement over what he sees as the
failure of the West, especially the United States, to get Israel to
the negotiating table.
   He told Jordanian newspaper editors over the weekend: ``Jordan
will pursue its efforts with all its powers on the Arab and
international level to de-escalate the gulf crisis.''
   Bush said after meeting with Hussein on Thursday in
Kennebunkport, Maine, that he had ``not come away with any feeling
of hope'' that Iraq will withdraw from Kuwait, despite intensifying
international pressure.
   The king painted an equally grim picture.
   ``This is the most crucial stage ever in Arab history,'' he told
the editors.
   The Arabs could either survive ``with a place under the sun
among other nations, or, God forbid, live in darkness losing
everything they have,'' he warned.
   Hussein has declared he still recognizes Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al
Sabah, the emir of Kuwait overthrown by Saddam's invasion. He has
said he will abide by the U.N. economic sanctions imposed against
Iraq to force its withdrawal from Kuwait.
   But he has not implemented them. Jordan's economy, burdened with
an $8 billion debt, is heavily dependent on trade with Iraq. Nearly
all its oil comes from there.
   Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba remains Baghdad's economic
lifeline.
   The European Community has discussed compensating Jordan for
joining the blockade of Iraq.
   But Fanek, the economist, said ``all the compensation in the
world'' would not make up for the ``far-reaching'' economic and
political losses Jordan would suffer, which ``threaten not only the
national income, but also national security.''

<TEXT>
   Two women are vying for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination in Tuesday's primary election, and the
winner most likely will face Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan.
   The GOP candidates are Mary Mead, daughter of former Gov. and
U.S. Sen. Cliff Hansen, and state Rep. Nyla Murphy.
   Mead, a Teton County rancher, and Murphy, a 12-year state
representative from Casper, seemed to agree on issues more often
than not during the primary campaign. Both support abortion rights,
oppose other states dumping garbage in Wyoming, and favor the death
penalty.
   Where they differ is on Mead's call for a cut in minerals taxes
to spur exploration. Murphy believes the current tax system is
adequate and that the economy will improve under the state's
diversification efforts.
   Sullivan is seeking his second term. His opponent for the
Democratic nomination is Ron ``Suds'' Clingman, a Rock Springs
motorcycle repairman who believes his stances on lowering the
drinking age back to 18, legalizing gambling, and cutting the
salaries of public officials are popular.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, the Senate Minority Whip, is seeking a
third term, and U.S. Rep. Craig Thomas is pursuing his first full
term in office.
   Simpson faces two political unknowns in the GOP primary, while
six unheralded Democrats are seeking their party's nomination for
the seat.
   Thomas was appointed to fill Dick Cheney's unexpired term in
office when he was appointed defense secretary last year. Thomas is
unopposed in the primary as is his Democratic opponent, Pete
Maxfield.

<HEAD>Budget Talks Still Need $105 Billion; Bush Says Stakes High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House said anew Monday that federal
programs could face more than $105 billion in spending cuts barring
deficit-reduction action by the end of the fiscal year. President
Bush appealed for cooperation from Democrats ``because our country
is at stake.''
   Bush's Office of Management and Budget released its new report
under a timetable mandated by the deficit-fighting Gramm-Rudman
law. The reductions the report described are preliminary now, but
both military and civilian programs could face cuts in excess of 40
percent on Oct. 1 unless Bush and Congress reach a budget agreement
before then.
   However, one of the few things the budget negotiators have
agreed upon is that they can't agree on $105 billion in either
spending cuts or new taxes to meet the Gramm-Rudman goal. They've
set their sights on about $50 billion in deficit reduction next
year, with the assumption that if they can strike that deal they
can then change the law to prevent any deeper cutbacks.
   The president met with his budget negotiators Monday in
preparation for the resumption of the bipartisan talks early next
month.
   Later, in comments at a Republican fund-raising gathering in
Rhode Island and on his plane on the way there, Bush said that
``cooperation is still possible'' with the Democrats and that he
has been pleased with the way some Democratic leaders have
approached the problem.
   ``There has been some good faith effort in terms of
negotiations. But it is essential now when the Congress comes back
that this cooperation be renewed ... because our country is at
stake.''
   In a more partisan attack, Bush said of bills under
consideration in the Democratic-controlled Congress: ``I will veto
every single spending bill that busts the budget. ... We're in that
tough a shape, so they can mark it down and put it in the bank.''
   The remark drew loud applause from the GOP audience.
   In earlier comments, in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars
in Baltimore, he appealed anew for Congress not to cut military
spending. He cited the Persian Gulf situation as an example of a
need to retain military readiness despite reduced tensions in
Eastern Europe.
   The budget office report followed the lines of predictions it
made last month when the administration released its mid-year
economic review.
   Under Gramm-Rudman, the federal deficit must be reduced to $64
billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 or automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts are ordered. The administration
estimates that the deficit will exceed the Gramm-Rudman limit by
$105.7 billion, and come that close only if the $50 billion or more
needed for the savings and loan bailout isn't counted.
   Social Security and other entitlement programs are exempt from
the cutbacks and Bush has exercised his option of exempting
military payrolls also.
   According to the OMB calculations, the remaining military and
domestic programs would likely face cutbacks of 43.6 percent and
40.7 percent respectively.
   For many agencies, the only way to achieve such reductions would
be to lay off workers, cut off benefit programs, or virtually close
down.
   ``Our preferred course remains the negotiation of a budget
summit agreement that provides for continued economic growth and
responsible deficit reduction,'' said OMB Director Richard Darman
in his letter accompanying the report.
   If not, the cuts ``will go into effect _ as required by law,''
he said.

<TEXT>
   With a second trial looming in the gang rape of
a Central Park jogger, a lawyer who was involved in previous
racially charged cases joined the appeal Monday of one of the young
men already convicted.
   The victim, who recovered from near-fatal injuries she suffered
during the gang rape and resumed her career as an investment
banker, said through intermediaries she won't comment on the
weekend conviction of three youths.
   A hearing was scheduled for Sept. 10 in state court on jury
selection in the trial of the three other defendants, Kharey Wise,
18, Steven Lopez, 16, and Kevin Richardson, 15.
   The six are accused of being among a larger gang of blacks and
Hispanics that rampaged through the park the night of April 19,
1989, accosting and threatening joggers and others. The white woman
who has become known as the Central Park jogger was raped, beaten
with a brick and left for dead in a pool of blood and mud.
   Yusef Salaam, 16, Antron McCray, 16, and Raymond Santana, 15,
were convicted Saturday of rape, assault, robbery and riot, but
acquitted of attempted murder and sodomy.
   They were immediately ordered jailed by Justice Thomas Galligan.
They are to be sentenced Sept. 11 as juvenile offenders and face a
maximum of up to 10 years in prison.
   Lawyers for all three have promised appeals.
   And on Monday, the office of activist attorney C. Vernon Mason
announced that he would handle McCray's appeal.
   Mason represented victims in the Howard Beach trial, in which
three whites were convicted of manslaughter for their part in
chasing a black man to his death on a highway in 1986. He also
advised Tawana Brawley, a black teen-ager whose claim she was raped
by whites drew widespread attention, but eventually was rejected by
a grand jury.
   Mason's legal secretary, Lenita Jones, also said that Louis
Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, would take part in a
nationwide support campaign.
   The Central Park jogger, whose name has been withheld by most
media, kept to herself in the aftermath of the verdict.
   ``She has no comment as there are still other legal proceedings
pending,'' said Lisa Barowitz, a spokeswoman for Salomon Brothers,
her employer.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer, who prosecuted
the case, also refused to discuss the jogger's reaction to the
verdict. ``I respect her privacy,'' the prosecutor said.
   The New York Post quoted an unidentified source as reporting
that the jogger said, ``Thank God this is over'' when she heard of
the verdict.
   ``She was thrilled. She was relieved. She was grateful to the
jurors,'' the source was quoted as saying. ``She called them
`wonderful people.'''
   Wise, Lopez and Richardson face 13 charges each, including
attempted murder, rape, robbery, assault, sodomy and riot.
   Lopez and Richardson face the same penalties if convicted on the
top counts: up to 10 years in prison. But Wise, because he was 16
when the crime occurred, can be punished as an adult and sentenced
to up to 25 years.
   The three teen-agers signed written statements and gave
videotaped statements to police and prosecutors. As in the first
trial, the statements appear to be the prosecution's crucial
evidence.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's response to the Middle East
crisis has won solid endorsement from members of Congress, but one
Democrat said Monday the time has come for the lawmakers to get
into the act.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, wrote House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley urging that Congress be called into special session ``to
exercise its authority and responsibility in this time of national
crisis.''
   ``What happened to the checks and balances established by the
United States Constitution and the constitutional power invested in
Congress to declare war?'' Gonzalez wrote.
   ``The president has committed our country to a full-scale war
under the guise of a multinational effort, when anyone who is
watching what is happening realizes that it is virtually an
exclusive American military operation which is risking only the
lives of American soldiers,'' Gonzalez wrote.
   Foley's office said he was out of town and unavailable to
comment on the letter.

   Volunteers filled sandbags and monitored
a leaking dam Monday, but officials said water levels had been
lowered and the threat of a dam break had diminished.
   Heavy rain and the leak prompted the evacuation of some patients
from Woodlawn Hospital in this north-central Indiana town. The
patients returned to the hospital Monday.
   ``Everything's back in operating condition and we have our eye
to the sky,'' said Karen Ewen, the hospital's vice president of
nursing services.
   Forecasts called for more storms across the region later Monday.
A flood watch was posted for the entire northern third of Indiana
through Monday.
   But John Curran of the National Weather Service in Indianapolis
said the stronger storms were expected to be south and north of the
Rochester area.
   Workers on Sunday night and early Monday hauled sandbags and
rock to shore up the 5-foot-high earth and concrete dam at Lake
Manitou. Pumps and drainage trenches brought the water level down
3.5 inches by midday Monday.
   ``As long as we can control the levels within the reservoir as
new rains may occur, we're out of danger of losing the structure,''
said Bruce Murray, chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in
Louisville, Ky.
   Lake Manitou is about 12 feet above Mill Creek, which flows
along the eastern edge of Rochester, a town of 5,000 residents.
   The threat of more rain made some emergency workers wary. About
70 volunteers continued to fill sandbags Monday, just in case they
were needed, said Sgt. Earl Vance with the Fulton County Sheriff's
Department.
   Volunteers were monitoring the dam around the clock from an
emergency command post nearby, Vance said.
   Twenty-eight patients were evacuated early Sunday from the
hospital. Many of those patients went home; two were transported to
a South Bend hospital.

<HEAD>Libya's Gadhafi Criticizes Iraq, U.S. for Mideast Actions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TRIPOLI, Libya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Moammar Gadhafi on Monday criticized
both Iraq and the United States for provocative actions in the
Mideast and threatened to withdraw Libya from the United Nations.
   The Libyan leader also urged the U.N. Security Council to pass a
resolution calling for military measures against Iraq, which
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The United Nations has backed the use of
economic sanctions in its effort to get Iraq to withdraw occupation
forces from Kuwait.
   At a news conference in the Bab-aziziya barracks outside the
capital of Tripoli, Gadhafi said he opposed Iraq's holding of
foreigners, including Americans and British citizens, as hostages:
``We are against the use of hostages as bargaining chips. This is
our fixed priciple.''
   Gadhafi's news conference, attended by about 150 news people,
was conducted in a tent-like structure lined with bright green, red
and white canvas. The Libyan leader was surrounded by reporters
shouting questions at him.
   When at one point the translator said, ``the United States''
instead of ``the U.N.,'' Gadhafi said, ``He's right. Now there is
no difference between the United States and the United Nations.''
   He also said, ``The U.N. Security Council has so far taken steps
within the U.N. charter, recommending the international community
impose economic sanctions on Iraq ... but the United States has
ignored this resolution ...''
   The United States, which has decided to stop vessels suspected
of carrying goods to Iraq, has stationed warships in and around the
Persian Gulf and in the Red Sea.
   ``The U.N. Security Council must now condemn the United States
and its allies the same way it has condemned Iraq,'' Gadhafi said.
   He condemned Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, and the military
response by the United States, saying, ``Unless the U.N Security
Council moves quickly, I am thinking of withdrawing from the U.N.,
and my nation will think of that too.''
   Asked if he had any time frame in mind for such a move, Gadhafi
only said ``if the United Nations cannot keep peace, there is no
point in maintaining membership.''
   The Libyan leader, dressed in a gray suit and a black-and-white
striped shirt, also said his country would be ready to send troops
if it was asked to in order to ensure an economic blockade of Iraq.
He did not elaborate.
   Asked if he could use his influence with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, Gadhafi said he had been unable to contact him because
communications with Iraq remain cut.
   Libya called news agencies and networks a day earlier to
announce Gadhafi's news conference and arranged for charter flights
to carry the press to Tripoli.

<TEXT>
   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered over much of the eastern
half of the nation Monday, causing flooding in northwestern
Indiana, and rain also was scattered over parts of the West.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms during the afternoon
extended from eastern South Dakota across southern Minnesota, Iowa,
southern Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, southern Lower Michigan and
northwestern Ohio.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts damaged power lines and tree limbs near
Indianapolis.
   Several roads in northwestern Indiana were flooded, the National
Weather Service said.
   Also in northern Indiana, the Tippecanoe River at Monterey had
risen above its former record flood level, set in March 1982, the
weather service said. The Kankakee River reached its highest level
since February 1985.
   In Wisconsin, the Pecatonica River crested at Darlington during
the night and fell to near flood stage by midday, the weather
service said. The crest was expected to reach Martintown on Tuesday
at about 4 feet over flood stage.
   To the east, showers and thunderstorms reached from southeastern
Pennsylvania across New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, eastern
Virginia, southeastern New York state and southern New England.
   In the South, showers and storms extended along the South
Carolina coast, and over Florida, northeastern Alabama, the upper
Texas Gulf Coast, southwestern Louisiana, Arkansas and southeastern
Missouri.
   In the West, rain and storms were scattered from the Oklahoma
Panhandle across the northern Texas Panhandle, northern New Mexico
and southwestern Colorado, and over east-central and north-central
Nevada, Idaho and western Wyoming.
   Hail an inch in diameter fell at Follett, Texas, the weather
service reported.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 54 at
Winnemucca, Nev., to 102 at Meridian Naval Air Station, Miss.

   Delta Enterprise Corp. asked consumers to
remove and discard plastic labels and decals from its Delta Luv
Pop-Corn Baby Walker because they pose a choking hazard.
   The walkers have been associated with five incidents of choking,
the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. All occurred
when children pulled off the decals on plastic toy dials on the
walker trays and placed them in their mouths.
   The six colorful round decals, which measure about 1{ inches in
diameter, should be removed immediately if they can be easily
dislodged, the commission said. Labels that are firmly stuck should
be checked periodically and removed if they become loose, the
commission said.
   Adults should also remove the plastic-coated ``Delta Luv'' label
with surrounding stripes found on the front of the tray, although
no complaints have been received about these labels, the commission
said.
   The paper warning label located under the tray should not be
removed.
   Approximately 100,000 of the walkers have been sold nationwide
since 1984.
   Owners with questions may write to Delta Enterprise Corp., 49
Junius St., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11212. The company can also be reached

<TEXT>
   Seven major toy distributors were sued Monday
by the Justice Department and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission for selling imported toys the government contended
violated federal safety standards.
   The suits against Toys R Us and six other companies charge that
the toys are unsafe because they contain excessive amounts of lead
paint or have small parts that could choke small children.
   The agencies said they were unaware of any injuries or deaths
resulting from the toys, some of which were seized from store
shelves by government investigators.
   In a statement, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the
lawsuits ``an important step toward preventing even a single
dangerous toy from reaching innocent children.''
   However, Michael Goldstein, executive vice president of Toys R
Us, said ``the suit is without merit. Our safety record is
excellent.
   ``We believe we will prevail in the legal action and we believe
it's a waste of the taxpayers' money,'' said Goldstein, who was
named as a defendant in the suit against Toys R Us.
   The lawsuits seek injunctions barring the companies from
importing or selling the toys that contain too much lead paint or
are considered unsafe for children under age three.
   The lawsuits described a variety of rattles and toy airplanes or
stuffed animals that violated the safety regulations. Many of the
toys cited were labeled for use by children over age three, but the
CPSC contended in court papers that the items were, in fact,
intended to be used by small children who could choke on small
parts.
   CPSC spokesman Dan Rumelt said the toys were mostly imported
from Taiwan but also were made in Hong Kong, China and South Korea.
   Besides Toys R Us, which is headquartered in Paramus, N.J., the
government also sued Child World Inc., of Avon, Mass.; Lionel
Leisure Inc., of Philadelphia; Value Merchants Inc. of Milwaukee;
Illco Toy Company, USA, Inc., of New York; Beachcombers
International Inc. of Fort Meyers, Fla.; and Division Sales Inc. of
Itasca, Ill. Chief executives of the companies were also named as
defendants in the civil suits.
   The complaints also named the chief executives of the companies
as defendants in the civil suits. The court papers said each of the
companies had been previously notified that the toys violated
safety regulations.
   Some of the toys have been recalled by distributors, the CPSC
said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Lionel Leisure declined to
comment, saying she was unaware of the lawsuit.
   ``Until we receive legal service, as far as we're concerned we
haven't been sued by anybody,'' said the woman, who refused to
identify herself.
   An official of Division Sales, who also refused to identify
himself, declined to comment, saying he ``didn't know anything
about it.''
   Mike Mervis, a spokesman for Value Merchants, said the company
had recalled all nine items CPSC cited as unsafe. Value Merchants
purchased the items thinking they met government standards but
``the product bought and the product that was shipped may have been
different things,'' he said.
   Value Merchants is continuing to negotiate with the government
to reach a consent decree to settle the case, Mervis said. But the
spokesman blamed inadequate inspection of foreign goods by the U.S.
Customs Service for the recurring problem.
   ``There is no foolproof way to control this without much
stronger federal intervention and some means of controlling the
inspection process'' in factories overseas, he said.

<HEAD>Official Proposes Blessing of German Unity be Advanced A Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher proposed Monday that the official granting of
international approval to German unity be moved up a month, to
October.
   Current plans call for the results of talks on international
aspects of German unification to be presented to a November meeting
in Paris of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE).
   Member nations of the CSCE include the United States, Canada,
the Soviet Union and all European countries except for Albania.
   The four World War II allies and the two Germanys have reached
basic agreement on how to iron out international complexities of
German unity.
   Probably the greatest obstacle was Moscow's insistence that a
united Germany cannot be a NATO member. The Soviets have since
reversed their position in an agreement that will allow Red Army
troops to remain in what is now East Germany during a transition
phase.
   The six nations that were involved in those talks _ the United
States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the two Germanys _
are working on a final document that will cover the results of the
negotiations.
   Genscher said Monday that document should be presented to a
meeting of CSCE foreign ministers in New York City on Oct. 1-2
rather than at the Paris gathering.
   During the early stages of the six-nation talks, it looked like
German unity would not happen before the end of the year.
   But the unification process has sped up quickly, and the merger
now looks likely to occur Oct. 14 at latest.

<HEAD>India Places Troops on Alert After Reported Border Clashes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India placed its troops on alert across
its northern border with Pakistan on Monday after clashes were
reported with Pakistani troops in a remote area of the disputed
Kashmir territory.
   Describing the clashes as ``a major border incident,'' United
News of India said that according to unconfirmed reports at least
10 Pakistani soldiers were killed and five wounded in the clashes.
   There was no official confirmation on casualties.
   ``It is very difficult to say if there were casualties. We are,
however, checking,'' said an Indian government spokesman, Ram Mohan
Rao.
   The clashes reportedly occurred in the Kupwara sector of the
disputed frontier, about 60 miles northeast of the Srinagar, the
capital of India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Earlier, Pakistani troops fired heavy artillery with explosive
and incendiary shells at Indian border posts in Jammu-Kashmir
state, Rao said.
   ``Exchange of small arms fire is a frequent occurrence on the
border, but use of heavy artillery and incendiary ammunition is
something new,'' Rao said.
   In Islamabad, a Pakistani defense ministry spokesman denied the
reported incident.
   ``There is absolutely no truth in the report of Pakistanis
firing (at) Indian troops,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   But in New Delhi, an Indian defense ministry official,
requesting anonymity, said all troops were put on alert along the
border after the incident.
   Indian defense officials in Srinagar called the incident
``serious.'' The officials, who also asked not to be identified,
said some of the Pakistani shells landed a half-mile inside Indian
territory.
   Rao said the Indian government was waiting to receive more
details about the border incident.
   ``Probably Pakistan wants to make a little more noise, but we
have taken appropriate defensive measures,'' Rao said. He refused
to elaborate on the measures.
   A week ago, Pakistan accused Indian troops of using heavy
artillery, anti-tank guns and mortars in an attempt to capture a
border outpost in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. At the time, India
denied the claim.
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars since gaining
independence from Britain in 1947. Two of the wars were fought over
Kashmir, a former principality claimed by both countries.
   The present border is a cease-fire line drawn in 1972 that
separates Jammu-Kashmir, India's only Moslem-majority state, from
Pakistan's Azad (Free) Kashmir region.
   In another sign of escalating tension, the prime minister of
Pakistan-held Azad Kashmir on Monday ordered mandatory military
training for all males.
   ``India wants to attack. ... Responsibility for the whole of the
Kashmir nation is on my shoulders,'' the prime minister, Mumtaz
Rathore, told about 3,000 cheering supporters in the Azad Kashmir
capital of Muzzaffarabad.
   ``From this day onward my mission will be the liberation of
Kashmir,'' he said.
   A senior aide to Rathore, requesting anonymity, said military
training would also be given to Moslem militants spearheading the
secessionist uprising in India's Jammu-Kashmir state.
   The aide said Rathore sought no prior approval from the national
governmet in Islamabad before announcing the compulsory military
training.
   Pakistan-held Azad Kashmir is relatively autonomous, but the
federal government is responsible for the region's defense,
diplomacy and finances.
   Analysts say Rathore's plans to provide military training for
Kashmiris could cause a confrontation with the new right-wing
government that succeeded ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   India has accused Pakistan of providing arms and training to
Moslem militants in Jammu-Kashmir. Pakistan, an Islamic state, has
denied the allegation, but says it supports the Kashmiri people's
right to self-determination.
   At least 1,034 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir since
New Delhi launched a crackdown on the Moslem secessionist movement
on Jan. 20.
   In May, both countries massed their armies along the cease-fire
line in Kashmir as war fears escalated.
   The crisis was averted largely due to diplomatic intervention by
the United States and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Trade Bill Affecting Northwest Logging, Duty-Free
Imports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed a trade bill Monday
restricting state and federal log exports in an effort to save
thousands of timber jobs affected by automation and federal
protection of the northern spotted owl.
   Bush said there was ``no doubt that high levels of export of
unprocessed timber have contributed to the decline in habitat''
that caused the northern spotted owl to be listed as threatened.
   ``While I am supporting this provision because it assists in the
preservation of critical habitat, I also note that it will ease the
economic transition in areas affected by the listing of the spotted
owl,'' Bush said.
   The log measure is intended to preserve the Pacific Northwest's
dwindling timber supply for domestic mills along with enough
old-growth stands to save the northern spotted owl from extinction.
   The bill makes permanent what had been a year-to-year ban on the
export of raw logs from federal land and imposes a new ban on state
lands in California and Oregon. Exports from state-owned land in
Washington would be reduced but not halted.
   Log exports from privately owned lands would still be allowed,
but the timber industry generally would be prohibited from
substituting them for logs from federal lands as a way to escape
the ban.
   The legislation, passed by Congress earlier this month, also
permanently extends the duty-free status of $4 billion in imports
from 24 Caribbean and Central American nations, including Nicaragua
and Panama.
   ``America's security and prosperity depend in large measure on
continued progress toward democracy and economic development in the
Caribbean basin,'' Bush said in a written statement.
   The legislation did not expand the trade benefits to cover
imports of textiles, shoes, sugar and methanol, commodities that
could threaten U.S. farmers and jobs. It did, however, expand the
program to give duty free status to articles processed in Caribbean
countries from U.S. materials and to certain leather products.
   President Reagan's 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative was intended
to lift the region's depressed economy through direct aid and an
elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers to spur
export-oriented businesses.
   Critics say the initiative has failed to large degree because
the direct government-to-government aid fell victim to U.S. budget
deficits and drastically reduced imports of oil, petroleum products
and sugar from the region.
   The log export prohibitions will have the biggest impact in
Washington, Oregon and Northern California, where dramatic harvest
cutbacks are beginning to materialize in government plans for
old-growth forests inhabited by the threatened owl.
   ``Our mills need the logs and Oregon millworkers need the
jobs,'' said Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., who estimated the law will
save 5,000 to 7,000 jobs in his state alone.
   ``What we've done with this legislation is say we want to keep
jobs at home instead of shipping them overseas,'' said Sen. Brock
Adams, D-Wash.
   The shift in U.S. trade policy is due primarily to the plight of
the owl, said Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.
   ``There are other factors, but clearly the owl focused
everybody's energy on this problem and the owl spurred the state
delegations and the administration to look at all sorts of options
for addressing the timber shortage at the mills,'' he said in a
telephone interview.

<TEXT>
   A Chinese driver for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing
was shot to death by police after he drove an embassy vehicle
through a roadblock, authorities said Monday.
   Ma Ji, 32, who was off-duty and driving the embassy's Toyota van
without permission, was shot in the neck and died instantly,
Beijing police said.
   His wife, Zhou Yue, also an embassy employee, was slightly
injured when the van slammed into a parked truck, said an officer
at the Foreigners Section of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. He
refused to give his name.
   The incident last Wednesday night began with a double murder in
which two people were shot to death during a romantic dispute,
police said.
   The suspect fled, and police in Fengtai, a suburb in southwest
Beijing, were ordered to set up roadblocks.
   At 11:45 p.m., Ma left his mother-in-law's home in Fengtai,
where he had gone to pick up his wife.
   Police said he was speeding when he came to the roadblock at an
overpass just south of his mother-in-law's home, and ignored a
police officer who motioned him to stop.
   According to police, the officer did not see that the van had
diplomatic license plates. The police also said the officer was
aiming at the lower right side of the van when he fired, but hit
the rear windshield instead because the vehicle was going downhill.
   Police said the case was under investigation.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Sherry Bell said, ``We regret the loss of
life _ a tragic event. (But) it's certainly not an event that's
going to affect Sino-U.S. relations.''
   He said Ma, one of several dispatchers at the embassy, had
worked there almost 10 years. Bell said he was unaware of previous
problems with Ma.
   Many foreigners in Beijing who employ drivers complain that the
drivers often take the vehicles for personal use.
   The double-murder suspect was later shot to death in the port of
Tianjin, about 161 miles south of Beijing. Police said he shot and
wounded two police officers who tried to arrest him, and they
returned fire, killing him.

<TEXT>
   The government proposed $280,000 in fines
Monday against United Parcel Service, accusing the company of
willfully violating federal safety laws requiring that job-related
deaths and injuries be reported.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said the
alleged violations took place at the company's Watertown, Conn.,
facility.
   UPS, the nation's largest package delivery company, was cited
for failing to notify OSHA about a job-related death and failing to
record more than 100 other injuries and illnesses. The company also
failed to record the number of lost workdays caused by the
injuries, the agency said.
   John Flick, a spokesman for the company based in Greenwich,
Conn., said there would be no immediate comment because lawyers had
not reviewed the allegations, which were issued late in the day.
   Last April, OSHA proposed a $625,000 fine against UPS for
alleged record keeping violations that occurred at the company's
Uniondale, N.Y., office.
   OSHA launched the Watertown inspection after UPS failed to
notify the Labor Department that a worker had been killed by a
moving vehicle while crossing a street. The probe was widened to
include a review of all accidents and worker-safety problems at the
facility.
   UPS also was cited for allegedly not giving workers in Watertown
training on how to handle spills or providing them with breathing
equipment while they clean up spills.
   Willful violations are those committed with an intentional
disregard of, or plain indifference to, federal job safety laws.
   UPS has 15 workdays to appeal the government's allegations to an
independent review commission.

   NASA said Monday it will try to
launch the newly repaired Columbia on Sept. 1, more than three
months after a hydrogen leak grounded the shuttle.
   Columbia will carry the Astro observatory, and the mission will
be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted entirely to
scientific research.
   It also will be the first shuttle flight since April, when
Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
Columbia's fuel leak, followed by discovery of a similar problem
with Atlantis, prompted the space agency to temporarily ground the
entire shuttle fleet in June.
   Columbia will carry seven astronauts, four of whom are
astronomers and will operate the $150 million Astro observatory.
Three of the observatory's scientific instruments will study
ultraviolet light emitted by stars and other objects. The fourth
instrument will examine cosmic sources of X-rays.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 1:17 a.m. EDT, NASA announced.
   Columbia was to have blasted off May 30 on a 9- to 10-day
astronomy mission, but a leak of explosive hydrogen was detected
during fueling and the flight was called off. The leaky plumbing
was replaced with components from the new shuttle Endeavour, under
construction in California.
   Atlantis' leak, in a different spot than Columbia's, was
discovered in late June. Atlantis was rolled back to the hangar for
repair 1{ weeks ago, and Columbia took its place at the launch pad.
   Atlantis' classified military mission has been rescheduled for
November.

<HEAD>HHS Official Disputes Report That White House Thwarted Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top federal health official on Monday
disputed a congressional report that concluded the Reagan White
House obstructed a government study of Vietnam veterans exposed to
Agent Orange.
   Dr. James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the
Department of Health and Human Services, said the study was
canceled for scientific reasons, not pressure from the White House.
   He issued a four-page statement detailing what he said were
factual errors in the Aug. 9 report by the House Government
Operations Committee.
   ``The bias ... is clear,'' Mason said of the report.
   The study said the White House ordered the study canceled after
the federal Centers for Disease Control said it was scientifically
impossible to use military records to identify veterans who had
been exposed to the defoliant.
   The committee said the CDC, then headed by Mason, did not
document that exposure could not be assessed and disregarded
alternate methods of measuring exposure.
   Mason said ``there was no White House or any other
interference'' in any of the initial studies conducted to determine
feasibility of exposure assessments. White House officials were not
privy to the results of these studies before they were released
publicly, he said.
   He also said the studies found no accurate way to assess
exposure.
   ``Each time a new method was proposed, testing showed it not to
be accurate,'' Mason said. ``It was not possible to differentiate
between the exposed and the nonexposed veterans based on military
records.''
   Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during
the Vietnam war. Veterans groups claim that exposure to Agent
Orange has been linked to 19 cancers and other health problems,
including birth defects.

<HEAD>Iraqi Freighter with Tank Bridgelayers Heading for Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iraqi freighter is heading to Jordan with 17
armored bridgelayers that enable tanks to cross difficult terrain,
Jane's Defense Weekly reported Monday night.
   Jane's publisher Paul Beaver said it was a clear indication the
Iraqis were trying to obtain offensive military equipment by
gaining access to the East German BLG-60 tracked vehicles. The
vehicles have scissor-like bridges that are capable of spanning a
gap of 66 feet.
   Iraq received seven in a deal last year with the former
Communist East German regime, the magazine said.
   Seventeen more were reported to have left the Polish harbor of
Gdynia on July 31, en route for the Jordanian port of Aqaba after
making several other stops, the magazine said.
   The new East German regime only became aware of the latest
delivery Aug. 10 and requested the four allied powers _ the United
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to stop the vessel,
according to the report.
   Its whereabouts are not known, Jane's said.
   The Foreign Office said Monday night it was aware of the vessel.
The Ministry of Defense said it would take any necessary action to
enforce the United Nations embargo against Iraq.
   Jane's also reported that the U.S. government may restrict
foreign sales of the Bell 206 LongRanger helicopter because of
concern it could be modified as a helicopter gunship and sold to
Iraq.
   A modification program on the Bell 206 is being funded by
Chile's Cardoen Industries, which has a long history of selling
arms to Iraq, Jane's said.
   The Chilean company, which would buy and modify used aircraft,
is trying to gain U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
certification to operate the two-crew helicopter as a single-pilot
aircraft, it said.
   U.S. officials are concerned the aircraft will be delivered to
Baghdad configured as helicopter gunships and may add it to the
U.S. Munitions List administered by the U.S. State Department, the
magazine said. This would require all U.S. owners to clear foreign
sales.
   U.S. State Department officials were quoted by the magazine as
saying Iraq seeks as many as 150-200 modified LongRangers from
Cardoen Industries.

<HEAD>Four Sentenced to Prison in IRA Plot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Americans and an Irishman were sentenced to
prison terms Monday for plotting to send weapons, including
anti-helicopter missiles, to the Irish Republican Army.
   In ordering the sentences, U.S. District Judge David A. Mazzone
called their crimes ``flat out terrorism'' that could have killed
innocent people.
   He sentenced Richard C. Johnson, 41, of Nashua, N.H., to 10
years in prison, and Martin Quigley, 27, of Dundalk, Ireland, to
eight years.
   Christina Reid, 25, of Sunnyvale, Calif., was sentenced to three
years and five months in prison, and Gerald Hoy, 40, of Easton,
Pa., was sentenced to two years.
   All four were ordered to serve three years probation after
completing their prison sentences.
   Johnson, Quigley and Reid were convicted by a federal jury in
June on various charges, including conspiracy to violate the
federal Arms Export Act and to injure or destroy property belonging
to the United Kingdom, possessing property to aid foreign
insurgents, and aiding an insurgent group in violation of U.S. laws.
   Hoy pleaded guilty earlier.
   Prosecutors claimed the four planned to ship arms, including
anti-helicopter missiles, to the IRA, which is fighting to end
British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Defense attorneys had claimed their clients merely shared an
interest in high-technology electronics.
   At Monday's sentencing, Johnson thanked his supporters and told
the judge, ``God will be watching what you do.''
   Quigley, who may be deported, was placed in the custody of U.S.
marshals. The others remain free on bail until they begin serving
their sentences Sept. 10, said Susan Spurlock, a spokeswoman for
the U.S. attorney's office.

<HEAD>President's Use of `Hostage' Term Could Set Stage for Military
Strike</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Subs 6th graf, A handful, to update with up to 14 Americans
taken from two hotels</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush crossed a critical line Monday
in finally describing Americans and other foreigners trapped in
Iraq and Kuwait as hostages.
   It may mean he is closer to sending some of the troops now
massing in Saudi Arabia into Iraq in a rescue operation or even an
outright attack on Baghdad.
   Or Bush merely may have been acknowledging the obvious.
   He held off for more than two weeks, emphasizing diplomacy and
appeals to Iraq's Saddam Hussein to observe international norms.
Hours before the president spoke to the Veterans of Foreign Wars in
Baltimore his spokesman had told reporters concerning the term:
``We would not use that word.''
   The plight of the foreigners seemed to worsen through the
weekend. There were threats to use them as human shields _ placed
in strategic locations to deter U.S. attack.
   A handful of Americans managed last week to cross the border to
freedom, but evidently none from Kuwait over the weekend.
Thirty-five removed from a hotel in Baghdad have not resurfaced. At
least a dozen, possibly 14, others were taken from two hotels in
Kuwait City _ destination not certain.
   So Bush revised the speech prepared for him for the VFW national
convention to inject that ``there can be little doubt, whatever
these innocent people are called they are, indeed, hostages.'' And
he warned Iraq and everyone else not to underestimate U.S. resolve.
   The president took that decisive step after meeting with Brent
Scowcroft, his assistant for national security, and with Deputy
Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   With the assertion, Bush could be trying to establish a legal
justification for an attack, although it was not immediately clear
that the status of the Americans had changed under international
law.
   The president also may be preparing the American public
psychologically for the support he needs to escalate from economic
pressure on Iraq to combat _ with grave risk to the lives of U.S.
troops and bomber crews.
   But above all, Bush's description of the Americans as hostages
helps him develop a rationale for using force to try to rescue
innocent U.S. citizens who by no stretch of the imagination could
be considered combatants.
   Saddam's quickly rejected proposal to free the foreigners in
exchange for a U.S. military pullout from the Persian Gulf region
set political conditions for their freedom, Richard Boucher, a
State Department spokesman, noted.
   ``It dramatizes the circumstances under which these people are
being held,'' Boucher said.
   Last Friday, in a subtle shift, Boucher said he did not want to
speculate about whether the Americans might be described as
hostages. And then, over the weekend, Thomas Pickering, the U.S.
envoy to the United Nations, called them hostages _ a description
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater challenged.
   Until the situation darkened, U.S. officials insisted reporters
should not use the term.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler repeatedly
stressed the Americans were not being held at gunpoint, they were
not being mistreated and efforts were under way to secure their
departure fromPIraq and Kuwait.
   From the days of the 19th century Barbary pirates, the United
States and its leaders have rallied to the aid of Americans
detained abroad against their will. But the risk of all-out war
dictates trying diplomacy first.
   President Jimmy Carter exhausted all available means after
Iranian fundamentalists overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979
and seized the Embassy staff and Marine guards. He tried a military
rescue operation that failed in a desert north of the capital, but
never pulled the trigger to fire on Tehran.
   The American television audience, in the meantime, was bombarded
nightly with the message that the United States itself was being
``held hostage.'' Ronald Reagan, campaigning against Carter,
capitalized on the frustrating situation and won the White House in
1980.
   The 52 remaining American hostages finally were released through
Carter administration diplomacy. But they were not liberated until
Reagan's inaugural, and after 444 days of miserable detention.
   Reagan, in his two terms, did not succeed in freeing a number of
other Americans held hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions.
Secret U.S. arms shipments to Iran may have been instrumental in
the release of a couple, but the other Americans remained captive
and at least two were murdered.
   Now it is Bush's turn to grapple with hostage-holders.
   The Iraq crisis looms as his toughest political challenge.
   Declaring the Americans in Iraq and Kuwait to be hostages may
expose him to a fate similar to Carter's. He runs the risk of being
branded a failure if the 530 or so in Iraq and 2,500 in Kuwait are
not freed soon.
   Direct military action to liberate them _ or at least to punish
Iraq _ could help or hurt the president, depending on the results.
   His delay in calling them hostages minimized the political risk
for a while. But Monday Bush crossed that line _ to an uncertain
outcome.

   At least 12 Americans, possibly 14, were taken
from hotels in Kuwait's capital and moved to an undisclosed
location, the State Department said Monday.
   U.S. diplomats in Kuwait and Iraq protested the action, but the
whereabouts of the Americans remain unknown, said spokesman Richard
Boucher. Other foreign nationals also were taken from hotels, the
department said.
   The Americans were staying at the Hyatt Regency and the Kuwait
International. They are among an estimated 2,500 Americans in the
Persian Gulf country overrun by Iraqi forces three weeks ago.
President Bush, in a speech Monday, referred to the Americans as
hostages for the first time.
   A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
the 12 or 14 Americans included men and women as well as at least
one family. He said he did not know if any children were among them.
   ``They may be going to Baghdad,'' the official said. ``That's
something we presume.''
   But he said he didn't have any solid information.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to use Americans
as a human shield in the event of a U.S. military attack. Bush told
the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Baltimore that the
Americans trapped in the two countries were hostages and warned
Iraq not to underestimate U.S. resolve.
   Securing the safety of the 2,500 Americans in Kuwait and another
530 or so in Iraq is ``the prime concern'' of the Bush
administration, Boucher said.
   ``We continue to do everything we can to obtain the release of
these people,'' Boucher said, adding that the United States is
telling family members that ``the prime concern of our people in
Baghdad and in Kuwait has become the safety and welfare of
Americans.''
   Another 35 Americans who were taken earlier from Kuwait to the
Rashid hotel in Baghdad were removed last week. Boucher said they
remain unaccounted for despite repeated U.S. inquiries.
   U.S. diplomats in Baghdad called again Monday at the Iraqi
foreign ministry and again were barred from going to another hotel,
the Melia-Mansour, to see if the Americans had been moved there,
Boucher said. The Melia-Mansour is where British nationals were
taken last week.
   American diplomats in Kuwait are in touch with ``as many
Americans as possible'' through visits, by telephone and via Voice
of America and the British Broadcasting Co., Boucher said.
   ``We continue to push for the release of all people held against
their will,'' he said.
   Despite reports Americans have been leaving Kuwait in small
numbers, the State Department can't confirm that any escaped over
the weekend, Boucher said.
   Meanwhile, Bush dismissed as unacceptable an Iraqi demand that
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City be closed by Friday.
   As the situation for Americans in the area worsened, the State
Department said non-essential diplomats and dependents were leaving
Jordan, which borders Iraq. The department says there are about
5,000 Americans in Jordan, 4,700 of them private citizens and the
remainder U.S. officials.
   Americans there were advised to consider leaving. Similar
instructions were issued for Yemen, which lies far beyond Iraq on
the Arabian Sea.
   ``I can't cite for you the specific security factors in each
country that might have led to that determination,'' Boucher said.

<HEAD>Lawyers Debate How Court Can Consider Sexually Explicit Pictures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A courtroom became an arena of artistic debate
Monday over whether five sexually explicit photographs by Robert
Mapplethorpe should be judged separately or as part of an entire
175-picture exhibit.
   Defense lawyers for the Contemporary Arts Center and its
director, Dennis Barrie, argued for dismissal of a misdemeanor
charge of pandering obscenity. He said the exhibition as a whole
wasn't legally obscene.
   Both the director and the gallery were charged when they showed
the photos by the late artist, which previously had drawn the anger
of U.S. Sen Jesse Helms and helped prompt Congressional action to
restrict funding of work deemed obscene.
   In addition to that defense motion, Municipal Judge David J.
Albanese considered a prosecution request to consider just the five
pictures identified in the indictment in judging whether obscenity
laws were violated.
   Albanese did not rule on either request.
   Judith Reisman, a communications consultant who said she has
studied sexually explicit photographs for the Justice Department
and the American Family Association, testified that individual
photographs would have affected visitors.
   Defense lawyer H. Louis Sirkin countered: ``But I go in to see
the exhibit as a whole, don't I?''
   ``Absolutely not, absolutely not,'' Ms. Reisman said. ``There
are people who walked in and saw one picture and left.''
   Martin Friedman, of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis,
testified for the defense that every picture in the six-week
exhibit had to be considered as part of the entire show. He noted
that the Contemporary Arts Center's contract to show the pictures
required it to show all of them.
   ``The whole purpose of an exhibition is to set up context,''
Friedman said. ``An exhibition must be all the pictures. You can't
isolate some of the pictures and talk about the exhibition.''
   The judge took over the questioning at several points during the
3{-hour hearing, asking defense witnesses if sexually graphic
pictures were required as part of a survey of the career of the
late Mapplethorpe.
   The judge asked Evan Turner, director of the Cleveland Museum of
Art: ``Is there some danger ... if the (gallery's) direction of the
theme was just a vehicle for exhibiting erotic photographs for
people who wanted to see erotic photographs?''
   ``I don't think any of the photographs in this exhibition fits
that definition,'' Turner said.
   The five photographs identified in one count of a two-count
indictment against Barrie and the gallery depict homoerotic acts.
   ``They are difficult images, but they are important to
understanding the artist's approach,'' Friedman said.
   The judge earlier ordered Barrie and the gallery to stand trial
Sept. 24 on another charge of using children in material involving
nudity. One picture in the exhibition included a boy with his
genitals exposed; another showed a girl with her genitals exposed.
   The charges of pandering obscenity and using children in
material involving nudity each would carry a maximum penalty of six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine for Barrie. The gallery could be
fined $5,000 on each charge.
   The Mapplethorpe exhibition closed in Cincinnati on May 26. It
opened in Boston on Aug. 2, provoking demonstrations for and
against the Institute for Contemporary Art, which is displaying it.
Authorities in Boston have not filed criminal charges.

<HEAD>Britain's Front Line Fighters on Alert in Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDITOR'S NOTE _ The following dispatch is from pool reporters for

domestic news agency.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's sole front-line fighter
squadron at Dhahran in northeastern Saudi Arabia went on alert
Monday night for a possible Palestinian terrorist attack, according
to a news report.
   Ian Bruce of the Glasgow Herald said the warning was given after
touchdown at King Abdul Aziz airbase of a Royal Air Force VC10
transport aircraft loaded with spare parts for the 12 Tornado F3
interceptors and chemical warfare suits for the ground support
crews.
   Bruce gave no source for his information, though thousands of
Palestinian workers live in Saudi Arabia.
   Charles Miller of the domestic British news agency Press
Association said the crew of the DC-10 aircraft that took
journalists into Dhahran carefully examined the plane after
receiving an intelligence warning about the possible attack by the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Miller did not specify the source of his information.
   The PLO was one of the Arab organizations that opposed moves to
send a pan-Arab force to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraqi attack
when they were agreed at the Arab summit in Cairo Aug. 10.
   It refused to join in the condemnation of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   Bruce and Miller are part of a pool flown to the Persian Gulf by
the British Ministry of Defense.
   RAF Tornadoes and U.S. warplanes were taking off and landing at
regular intervals, transport aircraft carrying supplies and weapons
were being unloaded, Miller said.
   The scale of Britain's deployment of 12 Tornado F3 fighters is
dwarfed by the U.S. presence, which is in the thousands.
   But the Tornadoes are flying regular training missions close to
the border with Kuwait, where 120,000 of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's troops are dug in, Miller said.
   Britain has about 1,700 airmen and engineers as its land
contribution to the growing allied force in the area. This includes
the Tornadoes at Dhahran and a Jaguar ground attack squadron in
nearby Oman.
   Squadron leader Ted Threapleton, 38, a navigator with the
Tornado group, said Monday night, ``We are doing the job for which
we have trained, and humor and morale is high.''
   The standard of accommodation for the British forces is
comparatively high. They have Portakabin-style buildings with air
conditioning and some British television channels are available.
   The Americans, however, are living in tents.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer who for weeks has publicly
defended himself against reports he was a suspect in a serial
killing investigation was charged Monday him with one of the nine
slayings.
   Kenneth C. Ponte, 40, who now lives in Port Richey, Fla.,
entered a plea in court that he was ``absolutely not guilty.'' Bail
was set at $500,000 surety or $50,000 cash, and Ponte was released
after his mother posted her home.
   The indictment charging Ponte with murder was filed last week
but was sealed to give authorities time to notify victims'
relatives. It accused Ponte of the beating death of Rochelle
Clifford Dopierla, and said she was beaten and died on April 27,
1988.
   She is one of nine women whose bodies were found near this
southeastern Massachusetts community between July 1988 and April
1989. Two other women are missing and presumed to be victims. All
had histories of drug use and some were prostitutes.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald Pina declined to say if
Ponte was a suspect in the other slayings. But court documents show
that authorities believe he had a personal relationship with at
least three victims.
   Several relatives of victims were in court when Ponte entered
his plea.
   One of them, Chandra Greenlaw, the daughter of a victim, said
later of Ponte: ``I want to see him hung.''
   Ponte's attorney, Kevin Reddington, complained of the negative
publicity Ponte has lived under while his name has been in
circulation as a suspect.
   ``This man has been under more intense pressure for the past six
months than anyone I can imagine,'' said Reddington.
   Ponte remained silent for months, but in recent weeks has given
several lengthy interviews to reporters, insisting he is the victim
of a witch hunt.
   ``Mr. Ponte welcomes a trial,'' Reddington said. ``He needs a
trial to clear his name.''
   Ponte also is awaiting trial on other indictments. Earlier this
year, he was charged with three counts of conspiracy to possess
cocaine. Last year, he was charged with assault with a dangerous
weapon in connection with a 1988 fight with a man.
   Pina told Superior Court Judge George Hurd that Ponte ``crossed
the line from the legal community and became a member of the drug
community.''
   ``This man went into a drug world, he recruited women, he used
them to purchase his drugs, he brought them into his home,'' Pina
said.
   Dopierla was one such woman and she was planning to expose
Ponte's drug activities, Pina said.
   ``The motive was to get rid of a witness,'' he said.
   After the hearing, Ponte echoed the comments of his attorney.
   ``I just want to say it's been a two-year-long nightmare for me
so far,'' said Ponte. He said his indictment was ``simply political
showmanship on the part of Ron Pina,'' who is up for re-election
this year.
   Pina, seeking his fourth term, faces a Sept. 18 Democratic
primary challenge by New Bedford lawyer Paul F. Walsh Jr., who has
accused Pina of political motivation in his handling of the case.
   Pina denied any political motive in the timing of the
indictments, saying of the grand jury: ``They don't work for me.''
The 21-member panel began meeting in March 1989.
   It was Pina who, in 1984, prosecuted the widely publicized ``Big
Dan's'' rape trial, involving a 1983 gang rape at a tavern of that
name in New Bedford. Four were convicted; two were acquitted
charges they cheered during the attack. The story was later made
into a movie.
   Pina defended the length of the investigation, saying the case
involved complex events in New Bedford's drug community. ``The drug
community is not a member of the chamber of commerce,'' Pina said.
   Investigators have reported that Dopierla's mother told them her
daughter once gave her Ponte's home telephone if her mother wanted
to reach her in New Bedford.
   Ponte has said his only contact with Dopierla was in April 1988
when he, as a lawyer, helped her with a man whom she accused of
raping her.

   Peace talks between Salvadoran
government and guerrilla negotiators have bogged down over rebel
demands that the army be abolished and officers be punished for
politically motivated murders, participants said Monday.
   Oscar Santamaria, Justice Minister and head of the government
delegation, described the addition of new guerrilla demands since
the July round of talks as a setback.
   ``The introduction of new documents with further demands alters
and distorts the course of the negotiation. It (the guerrilla
document) is not in accord with the seriousness of the peace
process,'' he said.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, the insurgent
army known as the FMLN, submitted an 18-point document. Its first
demand calls for ``the total demilitarization of society, by means
of disappearance of the two armies.''
   The rebels, in previous rounds of talks, had demanded trial and
punishment of officers implicated in four noted human rights cases,
including the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero and
last November's massacre by army troops of six Jesuit
priest-educators, their housekeeper and her daughter.
   The new document adds demands for punishment of those
responsible for two other cases, as well as ``the murders,
massacres and bombardments of civilians that have occurred during
the negotiations.''
   The document also demands investigations to determine
responsibility for 20 other specific crimes in addition to ``all
the crimes, murders, disappearances and massacres committed since
1979.''
   ``This is what is needed to create a new society,'' said rebel
chief Francisco Mena Sandoval, a former army captain who switched
sides in 1981.
   One member of the government delegation called the new guerrilla
proposal ``a low blow.'' Another said it appeared designed to
postpone the reaching of any substantial accord.
   The rebels, who last November launched the war's biggest
offensive in the capital, say they are prepared to make another
major military push if no signficant accords are reached soon.
   Guerrilla commanders have said privately they believe the army
is more vulnerable now than at any time in recent years for three
reasons: the impact of last year's rebel offensive, the implication
of several officers in the Jesuits' massacre and the imminent
reduction of U.S. military aid.
   This session is the fourth round of monthly U.N.-mediated talks
that began in Venezuela in May. The negotiations have produced only
one accord, on human rights, signed last month.
   The negotiators had moved on from the first item on the agenda,
the armed forces, after nearly three sessions failed to produce
significant movement on that subject.
   Both sides agree the military issue is the most difficult and
crucial to an agreement.
   The rebels say they are unwilling to again set aside the subject
of the armed forces and pursue agreements in other areas.
   ``The armed forces is really the only subject,'' said guerrilla
commander Eduardo Sancho.
   Also on the seven-point agenda are the pursuit of agreements on
electoral, judicial and constitutional reform, economic matters and
international supervision to ensure that eventual accords are
carried out.
   The administration of President Alfredo Cristiani, a
conservative backed by the United States, says it is willing to
restructure, reform and reduce the armed forces, but not abolish
them.
   Participants in the talks agree that a mid-September cease-fire,
set as a preliminary objective in May, appears virtually impossible.
   In El Salvador, the army Monday reported two clashes and rebels
said they ambushed an army patrol.
   Five guerrillas were killed in fighting 50 miles north of San
Salvador in Chalatenango province, an army communique said.
   Another clash near Jocoitique, 125 miles northeast of San
Salvador in Morazan province killed one guerrilla, the communique
said.
   Guerrillas also dynamited six more power poles. The attack
followed the destruction of 42 posts and pylons last week that left
nearly half the country without electricity for two days and caused
power rationing in the rest of the country.
   The nearly 11-year-old civil war has killed an estimated 72,000
people, most of them civilians.

<HEAD>Horse Adoption Program Criticized</HEAD>

   A government program offering wild horses for
adoption to citizens is becoming increasingly costly, with no
evidence that federal rangeland has benefited, a congressional
study said Monday.
   The Interior Department's ``Adopt-a-Horse'' program is aimed at
removing wild horses from federal rangeland so that herds do not
exceed what the land can support. About 60,000 wild horses have
gone through the program over the last decade.
   But the General Accounting Office, the investigative agency of
Congress, questioned in a report whether the program is needed.
   ``Range conditions have not demonstrably improved, and the
number of wild horses removed has exceeded the capacity of the
program,'' the GAO said.
   The study said the Interior Department's estimates on how many
horses should be removed often is based on unreliable information
as to what the rangeland is able to accommodate.
   In some cases, the Bureau of Land Management has removed horses
from ranges only to increase authorized livestock grazing by
ranchers, ``thereby negating any reduction in total forage
consumption and potential for range improvement,'' the study said.
   At the same time, the government continues to have problems in
disposing of horses taken off the range, the study said.
   Some horses remain at training facilities for as long as 19
months when no more than two months are needed for the training,
driving up the cost of the program.
   The GAO said the government also may face a costly long-term
commitment to providing sanctuaries for horses that are not
adopted. The cost of the first such sanctuary is now nearly
$900,000 a year and other sanctuaries likely will be needed, the
study said.
   The report noted that the wild horse program had been the focus
of other problems in the past because of an inability to find homes
for the horses.
   Between 1984 and 1988, the BLM opened the program to large-scale
adopters, resulting in abuse of the program and thousands of the
horses being sold by adopters to slaughterhouses.
   ``The fee-waiver adoption program resulted in the abuse and
commercial exploitation of thousands of wild horses, contrary to
BLM's legislative direction,'' the GAO said, noting that the
program was halted in 1988 after public and congressional outcries.
   The GAO cited no evidence of such practices continuing, but it
noted that the regulations allowing a waiver of fees for adoptions
has not been rescinded.
   The BLM earlier this year proposed new rules aimed at preventing
a single adopter from controlling large numbers of wild horses,
reducing the potential for profits and abuses under the program.

   Twenty black, angular F-117A Stealth
fighters kicked up rooster tails of spray Monday as they took off
on wet runways at Langley Air Force Base for their much-publicized
deployment to the Middle East.
   One of the planes returned shortly after takeoff under clouds
and periodic showers. Air Force officials were unable to say why
the plane turned back.
   Air Force Col. Ron Sconyers, spokesman for the Tactical Air
Command at Langley, said it would take the radar-evading planes 12
to 15 hours and several in-flight refuelings to reach bases in
Saudi Arabia.
   Air Force officials were mum on exactly what role will be played
by the F-117A, which is designed to bomb targets behind enemy lines.
   Unlike some other aircraft sent to the area after the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait, the F-117A cannot be
considered a defensive weapon, said Col. Anthony Tolin, assistant
deputy chief of staff of the Tactical Air Command at Langley, and
wing commander for the Stealth fighters until last week.
   ``I think they provide a great deal of deterrence. The Iraqis
know we can get in, hit the target, and get out without ever
appearing on their radar. That has to give them pause,'' Tolin said
Sunday when the planes arrived.
   ``They give us an ability, should we need it, to get in with the
least amount of casualties and attack those important targets if
necessary,'' Tolin said.
   The planes saw combat during the Panama invasion when they
attacked a radar site.
   The fighters flew to Langley from their home base at Nellis Air
Force Base in Nevada. Technicians and ground support personnel also
were en route to Saudi Arabia. Sconyers said two of the fighters
were held back for maintenance reasons.
   The $42.6 million-a-copy F-117A is one of the most expensive
planes the Pentagon ever launched. Billions were spent on the
research necessary to make the plane invisible to radar. It was
once so secret the Air Force flew it only at night missions high
above the Nevada desert. The plane was designed and built by
Lockheed Co.'s super-secret ``Skunk Works'' plant in Burbank, Calif.

   American military cargo
planes are being allowed to operate from this Arab federation, the
second Persian Gulf nation to accept foreign troops in response to
the ongoing crisis with Iraq, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said
Monday
   ``It's a measure of the seriousness of the situation, of the
fact they're deeply concerned that their very existence is being
threatened by Saddam Hussein,'' Cheney told reporters traveling
with him on a four-day mission to garner support from gulf states.
   A squadron of 16 C-130 cargo transports and about 575 Air Force
support personnel are at Bateen Air Base here to join Operation
Desert Shield, Cheney said.
   It was the first time one of the moderate Arab governments in
the southern gulf region has publicly announced such overt military
cooperation with the United States, even though several states had
quietly worked to help such U.S. operations as the reflagging of
Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq war.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia agreed earlier to allow the influx of
tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel, as well as other
foreign troops.
   Cheney said the emirates ``are eager to cooperate with the
United States and the other forces that have joined in the
multinational effort to ensure that (Saddam) doesn't come any
further.''
   The announcement came after Cheney met at a white marble and
gilt waterside palace with Sheik Zayed al Nahyan, president of the
United Arab Emirates, a group of seven loose alliances.
   Cheney said nations once cool to a U.S. military presence ``are
prepared now to actively engage with us, taking steps to enhance
their security that would not have been possible prior to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.''
   Cheney's presence in this Muslim nation of 1.6 million on the
southern edge of the Gulf was remarkable in itself: He is the
highest-ranking U.S. official ever to visit the Arab state.
   Cheney arrived in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, after making a detour to
Qatar. He visited five Persian Gulf states within 15 hours.
   Cheney also was to travel Monday to Oman and Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, where he was scheduled to meet with the Saudi royal family,
and to Doha, Qatar.
   ``Being here in the U.A.E. is a significant departure for us,''
Cheney said as he visited a C-130 crew near the flight line.
   Asked about possible arms sales to nations in the region, Cheney
said he believed there was a ``general interest'' in finding ways
to strengthen the security position of the governments of the Gulf
in the years ahead.
   ``We want to work with them in training and exercises while we
are here _ and add equipment if that's what they need to enhance
their own self-defense capabilities,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, as thousands of U.S. military personnel continue to
pour into Saudi Arabia, support units went to work. The 314th
Tactical Airlift Wing from Little Rock, Ark., pieced together a
small town of small air-conditioned mobile homes within 48 hours of
their arrival five days ago.
   While some of the airmen and crews worked to maintain the four
huge propellers of the giant green C-130 transport planes on the
tarmac, several dozen men dressed in cutoffs and T-shirts lounged
outside their housing units, hoping to catch a glimpse of Cheney.
   While the buildings may keep the searing, white-hot desert sun
at bay, even those used to Arkansas weather took a beating from the
heat.
   ``I don't think I've ever drank this much water in my life,''
said Col. Dave Mason, the group's commander.
   Mason said some of his crews had just flown 30,000 MRE's _ Meals
Ready to Eat _ overnight, and were ready to transport other loads
of ammunition, foodstuffs and supplies.
   Piled high inside a hangar were the squadron's tents, some food
supplies and water filtration gear. The unit is drinking about
2,000 bottles of water per day.
   Some 35 missions have already been flown by the group, assigned
to haul cargo that has been flown or shipped in from the United
States throughout the Saudi Arabian peninsula.
   ``It's rough, very rough,'' said a female captain from Monroe,
N.C., one of the 13 women with the squadron. ``I just left a
20-month-old daughter at home.''

   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Monday that
American citizens in Jordan were being advised to leave ``on a
voluntary basis.''
   Also Monday, the Jordanian news agency reported eight Americans
were among 495 passengers who flew in from Baghdad aboard an Iraqi
Airways jumbo jet.
   Sources at Queen Alia airport said all eight were of Arab origin
and carried travel documents other than their American passports.
Iraq has refused to allow most Westerners to leave Iraqi territory
in the aftermath of international condemnation of its Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   The sources would not identify the evacuees, and U.S. embassy
sources said they had no information about them.
   Other Americans of Arab or Asian origin have been allowed to
leave Iraq in recent days. Most of them crossed overland into
Jordan.
   The U.S. Embassy spokesman, Jonathan Owen, said U.S. citizens in
the kingdom were being advised to leave in accordance with a State
Department advisory to all U.S. citizens ``to defer non-essential
travel to Jordan.''
   He added that non-essential staff at the embassy, and their
dependants, were also told they were ``at liberty to leave on a
voluntary basis.''
   ``This is not an evacuation,'' Owen stressed. He said the
decision was taken in view of the continuing tense situation
following the Iraqi invasion.
   Jordanian government statistics say there are about 3,000
American citizens in the country, many of them with dual
Jordanian-U.S. citizenship.
   The development came as the ailing Norwegian ambassador to Iraq
and the wife of the Argentine ambassador and her daughter were
among thousands of other foreigners, mainly Arabs and Asians, who
arrived in Jordan on Monday.
   A senior Jordanian security official at the Ruweishid border
post said 8,370 foreigners, mainly Arab and Asian nationals as well
as a group of 122 Soviet citizens, crossed into Jordan on Monday.
   The diplomatic group arrived on the Iraqi Airways flight.
   Associated Press photgrapher Max Nash said the wife of the
Argentine ambassador, Maxion Cortes Funes, was accompanied by her
7-year-old daughter, as she arrived at a hotel in Amman.
   Dressed in a two-piece blue suit, she looked tired but relieved
to have left Iraq. Nash said she declined to say anything about the
situation in Baghdad.
   She confirmed that the Norwegian ambassador, Harald Lone, 61,
``who is ill,'' was transferred immediately from the Iraqi jet to
another aircraft waiting for his arrival.
   Earlier reports from the Norwegian capital, Oslo, said Lone had
suffered a heart attack and that his government had asked Iraq to
allow a special plane to fly into Baghdad to evacuate him.
   A Soviet embassy spokesman said the group of Soviets included 72
military advisers, 27 women, and 23 children.
   This was the second group of Soviet evacuees from Kuwait. The
first group consisting mainly of 224 oil-rig workers was flown from
Amman to Moscow Saturday.
   The embassy spokesman said there were 880 Soviet nationals in
Kuwait when Iraq invaded the oil-rich sheikdom Aug. 2.
   The embassy spokesman said a third group of 346 Soviets was
expected to cross into Jordan after the overland journey Tuesday
morning. Tass, the Soviet news agency, late Monday said the third
group, mostly oil workers, had arrived at the Jordanian border
checkpoint.
   Tass said 188 Soviets remain in Kuwait.

   The French cellist Maurice Gendron, who played with
internationally known stars Yehudi Menuhin and Pablo Casals, died
Monday at home, his family announced. He was 69.
   Neither funeral arrangements nor cause of death were announced.
Gendron was married and the father of two children.
   Considered one of the greatest French cellists of the century,
Gendron was born in Nice and took up the cello at age 12 at the
Nice Conservatory.
   Gendron moved to Paris as a teen-ager and captured the
prestigious first prize in cello at the Paris Conservatory in 1938.
He made a name for himself playing in salons before artists like
Pablo Picasso, Jean Cocteau and Francois Mauriac.
   Gendron played for the Paris Symphony Orchestra for more than 30
years and performed chamber music with Casals and Menuhin. He also
featured as a soloist under the direction of Errest Ansermet.
   The Paris Conservatory made him a professor in 1970. France also
awarded him two of its highest civilian honors, Officer of the
Legion of Honor and the National Order of Merit.

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's official: The Seabrook power plant,
which became a symbol of the nation's debate over nuclear energy,
has begun regular operation.
   After more than a decade of protests and huge cost overruns, the
milestone was reached Sunday, utility spokesman said Ron Sher said
Monday.
   The plant's operator, New Hampshire Yankee, emphasized the plant
supplies enough electricity for a million New England homes;
opponents still fret about the potential for disaster.
   The declaration the plant is in regular operation for the plant
is partly a matter of semantics. During the final weeks of testing,
which were declared successful Friday night, the $6.6 billion
plant's reactor ran at full power. It has been generating at least
some power for customers on the region's power grid since tests
began in May.
   Seabrook Station is one of nine nuclear power plants in New
England that together generate more than one-third of the region's
electricity, reducing the dependence on ``extremely expensive and
unreliable foreign oil supplies,'' said Edward Brown, president of
New Hampshire Yankee.
   It took a decade to build the seaside plant, which was completed
in 1986 but didn't receive an operating license until last spring
because of regulatory delays caused by the plant's opponents.
   Seabrook became the national focus of anti-nuclear activists and
drew opposition from nearby residents who said the surrounding area
couldn't be evacuated safely if there was a nuclear disaster. More
than 3,000 protesters were arrested at the plant over the years.
   The Clamshell Alliance, which led the protests, believes state
residents should view any Seabrook landmarks as setbacks said,
spokesman Roy Morrison. That's becuase the plant produces nuclear
waste and has the potential to make New England uninhabitable, he
said.
   Court challenges of the operating license still are pending, and
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said last week it was looking
into whether there were irregularities in the way the plant got its
license.
   Morrison said Seabrook operators made the operation official
Monday to distract attention from the commission's investigation.
   The project originally called for two reactors at a cost of less
than $1 billion but was scaled back to one reactor because of
skyrocketing costs and lengthy constrution delays. The plant's
major owner _ Public Service Company of New Hampshire _ went into
bankruptcy, in part because of Seabrook costs, and is being taken
over by Northeast Utilities of Connecticut, another plant owner.
   The plant produces 1,150 megawatts of electricity, enough to
eliminate the need for about 1.5 million barrels of oil a month,
said New Hampshire Yankee.
   Iraq's invasion of oil-rich Kuwait ``make(s) it painfully clear
that New England must immediately begin vigorous development of
alternative domestic energy sources that are not dependent upon
events halfway around the world,'' said senior vice president Ted
Feigenbaum, who will soon replace the retiring Brown.
   Sher said each of the plant's utility owners and utility
regulators in their states would decide how much to charge for
electricity.
   Besides New Hampshire and Connecticut, companies in the
Massachusetss and Vermont own shares of the plant.

   Armenian militants fired on a bus in an
Azerbaijani village with machine guns and grenade launchers and, in
a fight with police, one passenger and a policeman were killed,
Tass reported Monday.
   The official Soviet news agency said the clash occurred Sunday
on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, one of the most explosive
places in the Soviet Union because of ethnic tensions.
   The militants, in the hundreds and hidden in hills, fired at a
commuter bus in Azerbaijan's Kazakh region, killing a policeman and
wounding four passengers, Interior Ministry officials told Tass.
Troops called to the area killed one and injured two of the
terrorists. Two servicemen were also hurt.
   Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan told his republic's
parliament in the capital, Yerevan, on Monday that the clash was
triggered by the capture of Armenian hostages in the area. The
Armenian militants moved in to release the hostages, he said in
remarks carried by Tass. The dispatch did not say who held the
hostages or what the captors' demands were.
   Armenia and Azerbaijan, on the southern border of the Soviet
Union, have been at loggerheads since February 1988 in a dispute
over Nagorno-Karabakh. The district has been in Azerbaijan's hands
since the 1920s, but Armenians want control over it and have been
campaigning to get it with strikes, demonstrations and political
moves.
   In another development involving one of the Soviet Union's more
than 100 ethnic groups, a congress of local councilmen in a section
of the Moldavian republic, located on the Romanian border, declared
formation of a new republic on Sunday.
   Tass reported Monday that the Gagauz, a Christian Turkish people
who are a small minority in Moldavia, sent a message to the Kremlin
requesting recognition of the Gagauz republic as part of the Soviet
Union.
   It was unlikely the Kremlin would go along with the move because
creation of a new republic requires the consent of other affected
republics, and that hasn't come yet.

   Jesse Jackson hopes to fly to the Mideast to
meet with Iraqi officials, Jackson associates said Monday.
   The purpose of such a trip by the civil rights leader was not
clear, but one source, who declined to be identified, said it
involved Americans held hostage in Iraq.
   Jackson's office referred callers to Michael Lender, who is
working with Jackson on an upcoming television talk show. Lender
would say only that Jackson did not plan to leave for the Middle
East immediately.
   Jackson's schedule for Tuesday showed him meeting in the morning
with Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to discuss civil rights and
voting rights matters.
   Earlier Monday, President Bush for the first time characterized
the 530 Americans in Iraq and the 2,500 in Kuwait as hostages.
   The trip, not officially sanctioned by the Bush administration,
would be the latest in a series of trips Jackson has made to world
trouble spots. He visited the Persian Gulf in 1987, meeting with
Saudi Arabian and Jordanian leaders and delivering 600 pounds of
Christmas gifts for the crew of a U.S. warship.
   In 1984, Syrian President Hafez Assad released a downed U.S.
Navy pilot, Lt. Robert Goodman, to Jackson.
   Also in 1984 Jackson went to Cuba to visit Fidel Castro, who
then released some two dozen Americans from his jails. That same
year he went to Nicaragua, where he praised the Sandinista
government, to Panama and to El Salvador where he tried to mediate
differences between Salvadoran rebels and then-President Napoleon
Duarte.
   Jackson, a former Democratic presidential candidate, plans to
host a syndicated television show starting this fall.
   He has spent much of the past year involved in District of
Columbia politics. He is a candidate for the position of ``shadow''
senator in the Sept. 11 Democratic primary election. The post,
which carries no salary, is designed to lobby Congress for
statehood for the nation's capital.

<TEXT>
   A ``floating hotel'' with 49 oil
field workers aboard broke loose while being towed during a storm
in the North Sea and was floating free in rough seas Monday,
Phillips Petroleum Co. said.
   No injuries were reported and the captain decided that all
personnel should remain aboard until the waves abate and a new
towline can be attached, said George Minter, a spokesman at
Phillips headquarters in Bartlesville.
   ``They're waiting for the wind to die down and it looks like
it's going to, according to the weather reports,'' Minter said
Monday afternoon. He said the rig was located about 80 miles off
the coast of Denmark.
   Two boats from Denmark were trailing the rig, he said.
   The Queen Elizabeth II was in the area when the towline broke
and had been standing by to help if needed. But after the two
Danish boats began watching over the floating rig, the luxury liner
was told it could proceed on its normal course, Minter said.
   The floating rig _ which Phillips calls an accommodation jackup
rig _ houses people working on offshore drilling rigs, Minter said.
   He said wind blew as high as 60 mph while the rig was being
towed, at a speed of about 4 knots, in the Norwegian sector of the
North Sea oilfields.
   The weather was becoming calmer Monday and four helicopters plus
ships in the area were keeping watch on the floating rig, Minter
said.
   Phillips had the rig, owned by a Norwegian contractor, on
longterm lease, Minter said.
   Only two of the people aboard the rig were Phillips employees;
the rest work for the Norwegian contractor, Minter said.

   An American who escaped from Kuwait
by dashing across the desert disguised as an Arab said Monday that
Westerners still trapped there might be able to escape if they're
willing to risk it.
   Steve Diemler, 35, was reunited with his family at his parents'
home here Sunday. He escaped to Saudi Arabia on Friday in a convoy
of 13 vehicles carrying 30 to 40 foreigners.
   ``I would tell them to get out if they can, take the risk,''
Diemler said in an interview Monday. ``I couldn't have made it by
myself and wouldn't advise anyone to do it alone. You have to have
someone extremely knowledgeable about the area.''
   But he added: ``It is up to the individual to weigh the risk. I
took the chance and made it and hope others can do it behind me.
But I don't want to tell a bunch of people to do it and get them
killed.''
   He said his convoy was guided across the open desert by Bedouin
nomads who refused to take any money for their assistance. The only
thing they wanted, he said, was the promise of American help.
   He decided to make his escape after Iraq last week ordered
foreigners in Kuwait to go to specific hotels.
   ``I mean nobody really thought it was for our own protection,''
he said Sunday. ``Everybody knew the next stop would be Baghdad or
someplace else. We knew it was turning into a formal hostage
situation.''
   The 35-year-old Jefferson City native, who has lived in Kuwait
for 10 years working as a radar adviser to the Kuwait Air Force,
arrived Sunday in a St. Louis TV station's helicopter that landed
in a field next to his parents' home.
   Family and friends waited in the front yard where yellow ribbons
were tied to the trunks and limbs of a half-dozen trees.
   Wearing a T-shirt with the question, ``Where In the World Is
Kuwait?'' one of his first comments was: ``I got out of a place
that's not so nice a place to be.''
   Diemler said he managed to escape because ``I knew people who
might know people.'' He said he wore the traditional outfit for
Kuwait men of a long white robe and headband with scarf to disguise
his Western appearance.
   ``The escape was the most frightening because it was going out
into the unknown. We had heard all kinds of things,'' he said.
   ``At the start, I thought it was a pretty desperate thing.
There's no way to be sure Iraqis wouldn't shoot at us and we were
in close proximity of tanks, armored personnel carriers and
troops.''
   While waiting for the guides to arrive, Diemler said, Iraqi
soldiers drove by three times but didn't stop. ``I thought it was
all over before it ever started,'' he said.
   He said after the convoy started out, they were forced to turn
around by Iraqi troops. The convoy went a few miles down the road,
turned off into the desert and headed out as fast as they could
travel.
   He declined to give specific details of his escape because, ``I
wouldn't want to say anything that might jeopardize the chances of
somebody else who is going to follow me.''
   Elsewhere, Robert and Katherine Hansen of Tulsa, Okla., said
Monday they decided to try to escape from Kuwait after hearing the
borders would be open on Aug. 13. Hansen, a consultant to the
Kuwait Ministry of Health, said a sandstorm made them turn back on
their first attempt, but they met a group of people preparing to
leave.
   ``They had seven cars and someone who knew the desert,'' said
Hansen, former dean of the Oral Roberts University dental college.
   The group of 18 had to abandon one car stuck in the sand and
cross several large oil pipelines during the three-hour drive to
the Saudi Arabian border, he said.
   ``We were led on a route that did not have Iraqi soldiers,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Trapped Americans `Hostages,' Says US Not Intimidated</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts new 22nd graf, An NBC, with poll finding support for
Bush</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush declared for the first time
Monday that 3,000 Americans trapped in Iraq and Kuwait are
hostages. ``America will not be intimidated,'' he said, demanding
their release as the U.S. buildup of forces in the region proceeded
at full speed.
   ``I want there to be no misunderstanding. I will hold the
government of Iraq responsible for the safety of American citizens
held against their will,'' Bush told cheering war veterans in a
blistering speech in Baltimore.
   ``It could get fairly tough over there,'' he said later at a
Republican fund-raising appearance in North Kingstown, R.I.
   Bush called Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``a man of evil
standing against human life itself.'' But he added, ``It was not
with passionate hate but really with a heavy heart that I had to
commit our troops to Saudi Arabia'' to head off possible Iraqi
attack.
   No shots have been fired in that desert standoff, but U.S.
warships have sent warning shots near two Iraqi tankers in an
effort to enforce an embargo on goods going in or out of Iraq.
Asked late Monday whether the United States was prepared to stop
the tankers, which kept moving despite the warning, Bush said
merely, ``Just watch. Just watch and see.''
   In Kuwait City, meanwhile, at least 12 Americans along with a
number of other foreigners were taken from hotels and moved to
undisclosed locations, the State Department said.
   The Americans were among 2,500 U.S. citizens who were in the
Persian Gulf country when it was overrun by Iraqi forces three
weeks ago. About 530 others are in Iraq.
   Thirty-five Americans who had been taken from Kuwait to a hotel
in Baghdad were removed last week and remain unaccounted for, U.S.
officials said.
   Without giving any numbers, Iraq said Monday it had moved
Westerners to potential U.S. military target areas, and it warned
its people not to hide foreigners.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a spokesman for Baghdad's
ruling National Council as saying: ``Iraq's foreign guests have
been in fact moved to all vital and military installations. They
have been provided with all modern facilities and they are all in
good physical condition.''
   Elsewhere in the inflamed gulf region, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney claimed success in an early stop on a support-seeking trip,
announcing that the United Arab Emirates had agreed to let a
squadron of U.S. military transport planes use their land.
   In Saudi Arabia, military officials said the United States was
moving significant forces with offensive capabilities into
positions from which they could launch strikes into occupied
Kuwait, according to military officials.
   ``I don't see us going into Kuwait but if those orders ever came
we would obviously want to be ready,'' one senior U.S. officer said
in a news media pool report.
   In Washington, the State Department advised Americans to defer
non-essential travel to Jordan in light of ``continuing unstable
conditions in the region.'' A stiffer advisory was issued for Yemen
_ non-essential embassy personnel and dependents were ordered to
leave and all other American citizens without essential reasons for
remaining were advised to do so as well _ after anti-American
demonstrations in the capital of Sanaa.
   Bush, in his speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, renewed his
call for Saddam to release Americans and thousands of other
Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait. The president again compared Saddam
to Hitler, and also accused him of violating his own religion.
   With no sign of a non-military solution to the heightening
Persian Gulf crisis in sight, Bush told the veterans, ``Today, the
outcome is not yet decided. Hard choices remain. But of this we are
certain: America will not be intimidated.''
   Bush had previously refused to use the word ``hostages'' to
characterize the detained Americans. Aides pointed out that Saddam
had not asked for anything in return for their release and also
said that calling them hostages might make them seem more
significant and make it harder for Saddam to release them.
   On Sunday, in fact, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater took issue with U.N. Ambassador Thomas Pickering's use of
the word.
   But Bush on Monday said it was time to state the obvious:
   ``We've been reluctant to use the term hostage. But when Saddam
Hussein specifically offers to trade the freedom of those citizens
of many nations he holds against their will in return for
concessions, there can be little doubt that whatever these innocent
people are called, they are in fact hostages.''
   Saddam's government said Sunday that the foreigners would be
allowed freedom if the United States withdrew its military forces
from the Persian Gulf region and scuttled the international trade
blockade against Iran and Kuwait _ an offer the administration
quickly rejected.
   An NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll conducted over the weekend
found that 72 percent of those surveyed approve of how Bush is
handling the crisis. Seventy percent said they approve of the
president's decision to send military forces to Saudi Arabia and
the Persian Gulf. The telephone poll of 805 registered voters had a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, NBC said.
   On a one-day trip from Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was in the
second week of a vacation, Bush traveled to the White House for
meetings, then to Baltimore and on to Rhode Island before returning
to Maine.
   Back in Kennebunkport, Bush telephoned French President Francois
Mitterrand to talk about the hostage situation and thank him for
France's ``firm response and leadership'' in the crisis. He also
called Turkey's president, Turgut Ozal, with warm words. And in his
Rhode Island remarks, he praised Britain's prime minister, Margaret
Thatcher, as well.
   The White House says there are no plans for him to cut off the
annual vacation before his planned Labor Day return to Washington.
   His speech Monday included some of the most fiery remarks he has
made on the crisis, following a weekend when he testily rebuffed
reporters' attempts to question him while he played golf and went
to church services.
   In his speech, Bush made a religious appeal to the leaders of
Iraq.
   ``In moving foreign citizens against their will, you are
violating the norms of your own religion,'' he said. ``You are
going against the age-old Arab tradition of showing kindness and
hospitality to visitors. And so my message is: Release all
foreigners now.''
   ``Iraq's invasion was more than a military attack on tiny
Kuwait,'' he said of the Aug. 2 military incursion by Iraq on its
oil-rich neighbor.
   ``It was a ruthless assault on the very essence of international
order and civilized ideals. And now, in a further offense against
all norms of international behavior, Iraq has imposed restrictions
against civilians from many countries. This is unacceptable.''
   Bush said the eruption of the crisis in the Persian Gulf
demonstrated a need for a strong military and he called on Congress
to avoid deep cuts in his military budget beyond the paring his
administration recommends.

<TEXT>
   Tourists flocked back to
Yosemite Valley on Monday after being kept away for 11 days by
wildfires that disrupted the park's centennial season.
   Most campsites in the valley and all rooms at Yosemite Lodge had
been reserved in advance by people anxious to begin long-awaited
vacations amidst the park's granite monoliths and waterfalls.
Vehicles were lined up for about 1{ miles when rangers opened the
State Route 41 entrance to the valley floor.
   ``We were just hoping the valley would open back up before we
got here; it worked out,'' said a relieved Linda Disosway of
Atlanta. She had worried that the fires would keep the park closed
on Monday, the one day she, her husband, John, and their three
children had reservations.
   None of those driving into the park was happier than Tim and
Erika Dallacqua of Ventura County in Southern California. They were
supposed to have been married Saturday in Yosemite Valley but were
wed instead in the campground at Wawona because the valley floor _
focus of most park visits _ still was closed.
   ``We were married right on the riverbed,'' she said. ``It was
gorgeous.''
   The newlyweds ventured into Yosemite Valley on Monday because
they had honeymoon reservations for the night at the stately
Ahwahnee Hotel.
   ``Then we have to get back to work,'' he said.
   Rene and Dennis Navarre of LaVerne, Calif., were part of a group
of 16 who decided not to cancel their reservations for this week
when park officials assured them most of the smoke was out of the
valley.
   ``It's so great for kids,'' Rene Navarre said. ``Up here, you
can have a family life. The hardest part is doing meals. Dennis
does that.''
   ``She cooks the rest of the year,'' her husband said. ``I cook
when we're camping.''
   Linda Brown of San Diego said she was depressed when she and her
husband couldn't get into the valley on schedule Saturday, but
``missing two days was OK.''
   Her husband, Bob, looked up at the royal blue sky with a few
white clouds and proclaimed: ``It's beautiful here.''
   The park was closed to visitors Aug. 9 by two major
lightning-caused fires that blackened 23,000 acres of land in and
near Yosemite. The fires were contained during the weekend. Even
though flames never came near Yosemite Valley, people traveling
there can expect to see the results of the fires elsewhere.
   ``Visitors will see burned trees, burned brush and burned
ground,'' park spokeswoman Mallory Smith said. ``Smoke is still in
the air.''
   To satisfy visitors' curiosity, park officials have prepared
colored maps that show where the fires burned. Superintendent Mike
Finley said it was the first time fires had forced closure of the
park 150 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   The fires, part of a series that burned up and down the Sierra
Nevada range, broke out only weeks before Yosemite's centennial
celebration, which is scheduled for Oct. 1. Park officials said
President Bush may attend.

   Researchers aren't sure why, but a study has
found that Mexican-Americans, whose prenatal care is as poor as
blacks', nonetheless have a much lower infant mortality rate, even
slightly lower than whites.
   Mexican-American women and their babies are ``a real anomaly,''
said Dr. Joel C. Kleinman, an analyst with the National Center for
Health Statistics, a branch of the Atlanta-based Centers for
Disease Control.
   They ``have a much, much lower level of education, tend to be
poorer and get relatively little prenatal care, but they do very
well'' in infant mortality, he said.
   In an interview last week, he discussed the study which was
released in July.
   ``There are a number of hypotheses'' why Mexican-American
infants have a better survival rate than black infants, Kleinman
said. Those include ``a lot more social support than other
comparable groups, like blacks,'' and ``maybe some dietary factors
we are not aware of,'' he said.
   ``We have to really do a lot more study of Mexican-Americans to
understand why they do so well,'' he said.
   The study found that 18.7 out of every 1,000 black infants born
in the United States died before their first birthday, more than
double the white rate and worst of any ethnic group studied.
   But Mexican-Americans' infant mortality rate was only 9.0,
slightly better than the white rate of 9.1.
   That's true even though only about 60 percent of
Mexican-American women got prenatal care in the first trimester,
the same percentage as black, Puerto Rican and American Indian
women. Among white, Cuban and Asian women in this country, about 80
percent got early prenatal care.
   Mexican-American women also have a higher percentage of teen-age
births than whites _ 18 percent to 11 percent _ but less than black
women at 24 percent.
   Health experts say infants of teen-age mothers are at increased
risk for health complications, probably due to poorer economic
standing, nutrition and medical care.
   ``Mexicans are the third largest minority group in the United
States, accounting for one-quarter million births per year,'' the
researchers' report said. ``They appear to have relatively good
pregnancy outcomes, despite a high rate of poverty and low use of
prenatal care.''
   The latest overall infant mortality rate for the nation is 10.4
per 1,000 births _ just 22nd in the world _ in early reports from
1986 statistics. Federal health officials project a 1990 rate of
9.1.
   The lowest infant mortality rate in the United States is for
Japanese-American infants, 6 per 1,000. Asian-Americans in general
have a rate of 8.6, slightly better than whites and
Mexican-Americans.
   Cuban-Americans also have a low infant mortality rate, 7.8 per
1,000.
   ``One of the explanations for Cubans ... is their generally
higher socioeconomic group,'' Kleinman said. ``Generally, they're
about the same as U.S.-born whites.''
   The statistics in the study come from 1983 and 1984 birth and
death certificates, the latest available when the comprehensive
study was launched. Hispanic data come from 23 states which collect
such statistics.
   The study is the first to match birth and death files in an
attempt to avoid earlier inconsistencies in classifying Hispanics,
the agency said.

<TEXT>
   A jury on Monday convicted a 23-year-old
man of raping, beating and stabbing a jogger, who staggered for
help with a knife stuck in her neck.
   Erwin Williams, of Syracuse, was convicted of second-degree
attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment,
assault and possession of weapons in the 1986 attack.
   A second man, Ronald Jock, 32, of Brasher Falls, pleaded guilty
to second-degree attempted murder last month in a plea bargain with
prosecutors. Jock, along with the victim, testified against
Williams during his weeklong trial in state Supreme Court, the
state's trial-level court.
   It took jurors just 2{ hours to reach a verdict.
   Williams confessed to the attack, but later refused to sign the
written statement he gave police.
   ``Given the district attorney's case, I don't think he expected
to walk out of here,'' said his attorney, William Rose.
   The victim, a 43-year-old suburban Syracuse woman, was choked,
beaten and stabbed 11 times during the Sept. 20, 1986 attack, which
occurred while she was jogging in Onondaga Lake Park in this city
250 miles northwest of New York.
   She walked about two miles for help with a knife protuding from
her neck.
   ``This is one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in this
county,'' said Onondaga County Assistant District Attorney Mary
Felasco. ``The defendant got his just desserts. Justice was
served.''
   The verdict was handed down just two days after three youths
were convicted in Manhattan in the much-publicized 1989 rape and
assault of the Central Park jogger. Like the Syracuse woman, she
survived despite serious injuries. But unlike the Syracuse victim,
the Central Park jogger suffered brain damage and could not
identify her attackers.
   Felasco said she would seek consecutive sentences on the rape
and attempted murder charges when Williams is sentenced by state
Supreme Court Justice Walter Gorman on Sept. 5.
   The maximum sentence for each is 25 years.

   Conductor Leonard Bernstein on Monday
canceled a six-city European tour for health reasons.
   Bernstein hasn't recovered from a series of respiratory ailments
that plagued him last winter and spring, Harry Kraut, Bernstein's
personal manager, said in a news release.
   He had been scheduled to tour with an orchestra from the
Tanglewood Music Center, a summer training center for young
musicians where Bernstein began his career in 1940.
   ``Maestro Bernstein deeply regrets that he must follow his
doctor's instructions and cancel his participation,'' Kraut said.
   Bernstein's 72nd birthday is Saturday.
   The tour, scheduled from Aug. 22 through Sept. 3, was to have
been the first time the center performed outside Tanglewood. It was
to have included concerts in Germany, Austria and Spain.

   A man who slipped into a coma after drinking a
Colombian soft drink that had been laced with cocaine in an
apparent smuggling scheme died Monday after doctors disconnected
life-support equipment.
   Maximo Rene Menendez, 25, collapsed July 26 after drinking from
a six-ounce bottle of Pony Malta de Bavaria that contained many
times the lethal dose of cocaine. Drinking just one gram of the
drug can be fatal, investigators said.
   ``His life support was disconnected at 5:02 p.m. and he expired
at 5:15,'' said Victor Maya, executive director of AMI Kendall
Regional Medical Center. ``There was absolutely nothing that could
be done for this man.''
   Menendez's family had a court order to cut off his life support
on Aug. 13 after neurologists concluded he had no brain activity.
But his leg moved and he took shallow breaths after the respirator
was turned off the next day.
   Doctors reconnected the equipment and the family asked for a
second opinion by experts at the University of Miami, who agreed
Menendez was brain dead without hope of recovery, Maya said.
   FBI experts have discovered at least 45 contaminated bottles
containing 20 to 40 grams of the drug in a 1,000-case shipment of
the soft drink. Federal officials warned consumers that hundreds of
cases of Pony Malta distributed in South Florida were unaccounted
for.
   The FBI wants to question Hugo Alfredo Rios, whose Miami Sweet
company imported the shipment from Cerveceria Bavaria S.A. in
Colombia. The bottler said Rios was unauthorized to import the
drink.

   Israel will allow Egyptians fleeing Iraq and
Kuwait to travel through the Jewish state on their way home,
Israeli television said Monday.
   The television report said Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny met with Foreign Minister David Levy to request that
Egyptians stranded in Jordan after leaving Iraq be allowed to
transit Israel.
   The television report quoted Levy as saying ``it seemed a
natural step to help the citizens of a friendly nation fleeing
tyranny.''
   Meanwhile, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency quoted a
source in the Egyptian Foreign Ministry as denying reports that
Egyptians returning home from Iraq would pass through Israel.
   But a top Israeli official confirmed that Egyptians stuck in the
Jordanian port of Aqaba awaiting transportation home would start
traveling through Israel within days.
   The Egyptians will travel the five miles from Aqaba to the
Israeli resort of Eilat on the Red Sea, and then four miles to the
Israeli-Egyptian border at Taba, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   ``We are just being humanitarian and good neighborly,'' the
official said.
   The official said Bassiouny will travel to Cairo on Tuesday to
formally inform President Hosni Mubarak of Israel's decision.
   Many Egyptians who have reached Jordan are unable to get air or
sea transport home.
   Bassiouny told Levy that thousands of Egyptians are stranded in
Aqaba and the situation is growing worse daily, according to the
Israeli television report.
   More than 54,000 Egyptians have already returned to Egypt after
fleeing Kuwait and Iraq, and tens of thousands of others are still
on their way, according to Egyptian officials.
   Some of the returning Egyptian refugees have accused Iraqi
troops of stealing their valuables and raping women in Kuwait.
   Israel army radio reported that Egypt sent 35 buses to Aqaba on
Monday. The radio report said Egyptians traveling from Aqaba
through Israel would not be subject to a passport check.
   Usually Egyptians crossing the Israeli border are thoroughly
searched.
   Israel has been considering this move since thousands of
Egyptians and other foreigners began fleeing into Jordan after
Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Despite the importance Israel places on its relations with
Egypt, Israeli officials had hesitated to open the tightly guarded
border to permit thousands of Egyptians to pass through daily.
   Egypt is the only Arab country to have signed a peace treaty
with Israel _ the 1979 Camp David accords under which Israel agreed
to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt.
   The Israeli action comes after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
announced that he will hold Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait, using
some of them as human shields at strategic installations.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has sent several thousand
troops to Saudi Arabia as part of a multinational Arab force to
deter a possible Iraqi attack.
   But despite the Egyptian government's actions, Saddam has
allowed thousands of Egyptians to cross into Jordan. Before the
crisis, there were an estimated 150,000 Egyptians in Kuwait and 1.6
million in Iraq.
   On Monday, 700 Egyptian refugees arrived in the port of Suez on
board the Egyptian ferry el-Tor that sailed from Aqaba.
   Some of the passengers recounted tales of horror following the
Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. They said Iraqi soldiers'
treatment of Egyptians worsened after Mubarak hosted the Aug. 10
Arab League summit in Cairo that decided to send a joint Arab force
to Saudi Arabia.
   ``I saw four Iraqi soldiers burst into the hosptial where I work
and take away two nurses to rape,'' said Samia Ibrahim, a
30-year-old nurse. ``They forced us to work for 14-hour shifts with
no pay and they stole our food and money.
   ``In order to let us through, they stole our video tapes and any
other electric appliances,'' she said.
   Hossam el-Din Zaky el-Sayed, 26, said Iraqi soldiers even stole
his watch before letting him leave.
   The returnees said they left most of their money and valuables
behind. Officials say Egyptian expatriates had billions of dollars
in Kuwaiti banks, most of which have been looted by Iraqi soldiers.

<HEAD>Mayor Calls for Tax Increase to Ease City Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN BERRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, urging Philadelphians
not to panic, pleaded with the state and the City Council Monday
night to help him raise taxes and cut spending to avoid a $206
million deficit.
   ``We are not bankrupt,'' Goode said. However, ``we must stop
reading lips and start read the writing on the wall. This city
needs new tax revenues.''
   He spoke as his administration announced an emergency borrowing
plan needed to keep the city from running out of cash next month.
   Goode, during an half-hour televised speech, called on the state
Legislature to give the city power to increase taxes by $150
million. The tax burden would be spread among consumers, homeowners
and businesses, he said.
   Goode also called for the lease or sale of Veterans Stadium _
home of baseball's Phillies and the football Eagles. Other city
assets also might be sold, including the Water Department.
   On Monday, Goode's administration announced plans to borrow $400
million through temporary loan notes within the next two weeks.
   Without the notes, the city would be out of cash by late
September, according to a report issued Monday by City Finance
Director Betsy Reveal.
   Even with them, the city's general fund would be out of cash by
May ``unless both interim and permanent corrective measures are
taken,'' the report said.
   Goode said the city's financial problems grew over decades, with
previous administrations merely taking temporary steps to avoid
crises, and were exacerbated by the recession now gripping the
Northeast.
   He also blamed the state Legislature, saying its power to
prevent tax increases is strangling the city.
   Goode also criticized the City Council, saying it repeatedly has
thwarted his attempts to raise taxes over the years. He asked the
council to cooperate and outlined several steps needed he said must
be taken immediately:
   _A freeze on city hiring and developments.
   _A repeal of the city's early retirement program.
   _An assessment of the measures the city's unions are willing to
undertake to cut costs.
   _A cut in all non-essential services, which he did not list.
   _A complete assessment of buildings that could be sold or leased.
   Goode's speech was his first public reaction since word of the
impending financial crisis leaked out a week ago.
   The note sale is expected the week of Aug. 27 unless the city
can obtain a letter of credit, in which case it would be postponed
one week, said Reveal.
   The city reportedly has had trouble attracting buyers for the
notes. Lead underwriter for the public offering will be Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets.
   The city's fiscal 1991 budget, which was balanced on paper when
it was passed in May, projected the deficit for the previous fiscal
year would amount to $60.8 million. However, the deficit was
swollen by sluggish tax receipts on commercial property and other
tax receipts and is projected at $73.8 million in the new report.
   That amount must be paid during the current 1991 fiscal year,
which began June 30.
   According to the report, 1991 revenues will be $106.2 million
less than expected when the budget was adopted and obligations will
be $132.3 million more than expected.
   The decrease in revenues was blamed partly on the state
Legislature's refusal to approve a half-cent local sales tax and
mandatory withholding of the city wage tax.
   The $206.4 million deficit projection does not include a $45
million subsidy for the regional mass-transit system. Goode has
vowed to withhold the subsidy for Southeastern Pennsylvania
Transportation Authority unless the city gets approval of and
revenue from a local sales tax.

<HEAD>Zaire Students Given Ultimatum to Leave Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 40 Zairean students who have been occupying
their embassy in Beijing for six days were given an ultimatum
Monday by Chinese authorities to leave immediately, the students
said.
   The students began their occupation last Wednesday, holding the
ambassador and his staff hostage in the walled embassy compound.
The students are protesting their government's failure to provide
promised living allowances and plane tickets home for graduates.
   At about noon, six Chinese officials from the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, the State Education Commission and the Beijing Public
Security Bureau came to the Zairean Embassy to deliver the
ultimatum.
   ``They told us that we had to leave immediately. If we don't,
they will take the necessary measures,'' said Katembo Salumu, 29,
who graduated from Qinghua University this summer.
   The officials did not elaborate, but cautioned that this was
``the last warning,'' the students said.
   The Education Commission confirmed the visit took place, but
refused to give details. The Foreign Ministry said it had no
comment.
   The Chinese government had not previously been involved in the
dispute, although several uniformed and plainclothed police in a
Public Security car kept watch outside the embassy each day.
   It is the second year in a row the students have staged a sit-in
at the embassy with the same complaints.
   Zairean Ambassador Lombo Lo Mangamanga said the police last year
refused to enter the compound when he asked them to remove the
students.
   The students said Monday's visit was prompted by a meeting in
Zaire between their foreign minister, Mushobekwa Wakalimba, and the
Chinese ambassador.
   Salumu said the students told the Chinese authorities, ``This is
not a problem with the Chinese _ it's with our own government.''
   ``We told them we will stay here. If they want to take any
measures, it's up to them. We are not scared,'' said Bangala Ngoy,
29, a graduate student at Shanghai's Huadong Chemical Engineering
College.
   The students have said they would stay at the embassy until they
get their living subsidies, which have not been paid in at least 14
months, and until their government pays for air tickets home for
seven graduates.
   The students have locked the embassy compound gates with a
bicycle chain, refusing to allow the half-dozen Zairean diplomats
out or the embassy's Chinese staff in.
   Last Thursday, Mangamanga arranged for the Chinese government to
provide plane tickets for the students who had none, but the
students refused to accept the settlement, arguing that their
government should pay for the tickets it promised to provide.
   The students said they were told the Zaire foreign minister told
the Chinese ambassador that funds for their living allowances have
been transferred to Belgium, from where it would be forwarded to
Beijing.
   Zaire has about 80 Zairean studying in China _ one of the
largest groups of African students here. Under friendship
agreements signed in the 1960s, China gives scholarships to
students from many African countries to complete entire degree
programs in China, usually in the sciences.
   Each year, students from several African countries complain that
they are not getting promised funds and plane tickets home from
their governments.

<HEAD>Desert-Trained Regiment Ships Out to Middle East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZANNE GAMBOA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FORT BLISS, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers sweltering in the Middle East
will get some seasoned help soon, when the 3rd Armored Cavalry, one
of the Army's elite desert units, ships out, officials said Monday.
   The entire regiment, with nearly 4,500 soldiers, 1,700 vehicles
and 75 aircraft, will be dispatched to the Persian Gulf, said the
regiment's commander, Col. Doug Starr.
   He said his troops are used to dealing with the searing heat and
wind-whipped sand they'll encounter while helping the United States
face off with Iraq's Saddam Hussein, whose troops are massed on the
border of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   The unit regularly leaves Fort Bliss to train in southern New
Mexico, West Texas and the California desert.
   ``We're well trained in the desert, used to the desert,
acclimated to the desert,'' Starr said. ``We feel we are ready to
deploy to whatever part of the Middle East the commander in chief
may want to send us.''
   Starr said the unit knows from experience how to keep military
working in the harsh desert climate, how much water each soldier
needs and how to endure insufferable temperatures inside a tank.
   ``The inside of a tank in this type of environment is a tough
place to be ... It requires a lot of physical fitness a lot of
desert acclimation ... There's just no easy answer to how you
defeat the heat,'' said Starr.
   It may be thoroughly trained, but the unit lacks combat
experience. Starr said he and one other officer and a few senior
enlisted soldiers are the only members of the regiment with combat
experience.
   The regiment will act as a flank guard or on scouting missions,
doing reconnaissance and feeding intelligence to other units.
   ``What we'll lend to that theater is a great deal of combat
power,'' Starr said.
   The regiment has been loading vehicles on rail cars since Aug. 5
and post officials announced Thursday that the unit was deploying,
a military term that means the troops are on alert, preparing for
movement and likely to move at any time.
   Fort Bliss officials refuse to reveal when the unit will
actually move.

   A Canadian-owned cargo ship caught fire Monday in
the Atlantic Ocean about 240 miles southwest of Ireland, the coast
guard said.
   The Indian master of the 37,000-ton bulk carrier Innovator,
believed to have a crew of 31, reported no injuries and said there
was no need to evacuate the vessel, a coast guard spokesman in
Falmouth said.
   The fire broke out in the accommodation quarters of the
Bahamian-registered vessel, the spokesman said.
   He said the master later reported the crew brought the blaze
under control, had restarted the engines and expected to continue
its voyage to the St. Lawrence Seaway.
   The British-registered cargo vessel MV Ullswater went to the
scene carrying hoses, firefighting foam and breathing apparatus,
but help was not needed, the spokesman said.
   The master told the coast guard the carrier has no cargo on
board, the spokesman said.

   Singer Pearl Bailey most likely died of a
heart attack, although the cause of death won't be known precisely
for a few weeks, a hospital officials said Monday.
   Autopsy results suggest a heart attack, but tests to confirm
that aren't complete, said Dr. Emanuel Rubin, chairman of the
pathology department at Jefferson Medical College, which conducted
the autopsy.
   The 72-year-old singer, who had a history of heart ailments,
died Friday evening at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, which
is connected with the college. She was unconscious when she was
rushed to the hospital and was pronounced dead a half hour later.
   Rubin said a provisional diagnosis showed Miss Bailey had
significant narrowing of the coronary arteries, the main source of
blood for the heart muscle.
   ``If (the heart) doesn't receive enough blood, that's a heart
attack,'' he said. ``The conclusive diagnosis will be made from an
examination of microscopic slides, which will be available in a few
weeks.''

<TEXT>
   Diplomats said Monday that
government troops in Liberia had killed an American missionary, and
there were reports that one of Liberia's rebel factions had reached
an informal truce with the government.
   The missionary, a Baptist, was killed by government troops who
arrested him Thursday, according to diplomats. They said the body
of the slain man, identified as Clark Alan Jacobsen, 42, of
Sterling, Alaska, was handed over to the U.S. Embassy on Saturday.
   The embassy was filing a formal protest with the government, the
diplomats said. They did not say why Jacobsen was detained.
   Jacobsen traveled to Liberia last September with Joel Poe of
Sterling as missionaries for the Sterling-based Frontiers of Faith
Ministries.
   Poe returned to Alaska in October but Jacobsen stayed to
continue his mission work, according to Poe, who said Jacobsen had
planned to return home next month.
   A second American arrested and accused of fighting for the
rebels, Andrew Voros of New Jersey, was freed Saturday and
evacuated from Monrovia by U.S. Marines, the diplomats said.
   Jacobsen was the second American known to have died in Liberia's
8-month-old civil war, which has left at least 5,000 people dead,
most of them civilians.
   A Protestant missionary, Tom Jackson, and his British wife June
were killed March 24 near Bahn, a town in northeastern Nimba county
where they had lived for years. They were forced by soldiers to
travel in a convoy that was ambushed by guerrillas loyal to rebel
leader Charles Taylor.
   Most of the 6,000 Americans who had livedin Liberia were
missionaries. After the deaths of the Jacksons, the U.S. Embassy in
Monrovia put out the first of several warnings for Americans to
leave.
   Meanwhile, followers of rebel leader Prince Johnson and troops
loyal to President Samuel Doe told a Western diplomat they were
prepared to join forces to resist a possible attack by rebels from
a rival faction opposed to the truce.
   Those rebels, led by Taylor, are camped out on the outskirts of
the capital, Monrovia.
   There was no official announcement of a cease-fire from either
Johnson or Doe. News of the truce was received in a radio telephone
call from diplomats in Monrovia to their embassies in Abidjan,
capital of neighboring Ivory Coast.
   ``The diplomat said he found AFL (Armed Forces of Liberia) and
INPF (Independent National Patriotic Front) troops dancing in the
streets, saying it was all over,'' said one diplomat in Abidjan. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``As part of the celebration, they were throwing money into the
air and both lots of soldiers together with some civilians in the
streets were looting what was left in the stores,'' the diplomat
said.
   He said there was speculation that the lower ranks of the
military and the Prince Johnson rebel faction ``patched it up
themselves because everybody is thoroughly fed up with the whole
thing.''
   The rebellion to oust Doe reached Monrovia in June. Since then,
the city has been battered by rockets and mortars. Bodies litter
the streets and all the hospitals are closed.
   Government soldiers and rebels have plundered shops and homes
and beleaguered residents have been without fresh food supplies,
water, electricity and telephone communication for nearly two
months.
   It was unclear if Monday's truce would hold. The cease-fire
comes as West African leaders trying to halt the fighting prepare
for a peace conference scheduled to start next week in Banjul,
Gambia.
   Taylor and Doe plan to send envoys to the meeting. Johnson, who
split with Taylor in February and formed a rival faction, has also
said he would attend.
   A six-nation task force of the Economic Community of West
African States was mobilizing in Freetown, Sierra Leone, to sail to
Monrovia to enforce a truce.
   Thousands of Guinean troops have been stationed on Liberia's
northwestern border since Taylor's rebels began crossing into
Guinea to kill Liberian refugees of the Mandingo tribe. Taylor's
rebels have accused the Mandingo of supporting Doe.

   Amnesty International on Monday demanded the
immediate release of all foreigners detained in Iraq and Kuwait,
and protested reported human rights abuses by Iraqi troops in
Kuwait.
   The London-based rights organization said it is sending appeals
to the Iraqi government in Baghdad, Iraq's mission to the United
Nations, and Iraqi ambassadors in key countries.
   Amnesty expressed concern about Iraq's plan to detain as many as
13,000 Westerners.
   Amnesty said holding foreign nationals was ``arbitrary and
contrary to fundamental internationally recognized standards of
human rights'' and demanded their immediate and unconditional
release.
   It cited reports that up to 200 Westerners were being held in
Baghdad hotels and that others had been moved from hotels in Kuwait
to secret locations, possibly including military and industrial
installations in Iraq.
   The organization said it was also concerned about reported
rapes, killings and summary executions by Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   Amnesty said it had received information, impossible to confirm,
about a number of reported killings of unarmed civilians in Kuwait
outside the context of armed conflict.
   In one incident on Aug. 8, it said, Iraqi soldiers reportedly
fired at a group of some 35 women and young people in the Jabiriyya
district of Kuwait city who were peacefully protesting Iraq's
annexation of Kuwait. A witness reported that three people _ aged
13, 16 and 20 _ died after being shot in the head and heart, it
said.
   Amnesty, which opposes the death penalty in all circumstances,
said it was concerned that Iraq had extended it to cases involving
looting and hoarding food. An Iraqi soldier was reported to have
been executed Aug. 16 for looting and his body was hung from a
crane as a warning to others, it said.
   Hundreds of Iraqis living in Kuwait were reported to have been
arrested by Iraqi troops within days of the invasion, and Amnesty
said there has been no information about their fate.
   The majority were reportedly Shiite Moslems with suspected links
to al-Dawa al-Islamiyya or Islamic Call, an outlawed Iraqi
opposition group whose members face the death penalty in Iraq, it
said.

<HEAD>Medical Records Show Chiles Was Depressed, Not Suicidal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENT KALLESTAD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles on
Monday released 26 years of medical records in an effort to defuse
suggestions he's unfit to fulfill his current political ambition _
to be governor of Florida.
   A doctor treating Chiles for depression said Monday that the
Democratic candidate was never suicidal and suffered no
``disabling'' symptoms.
   Chiles, 60, served three terms in the Senate before announcing
in 1987 he wouldn't seek a fourth term because of what he termed
``burnout.''
   Chiles' opponent in the Sept. 4 primary, U.S. Rep Bill Nelson,
and Republican Gov. Bill Martinez have released their medical
records and urged Chiles to do the same.
   The records released Monday showed Chiles has taken
anti-depressant medication since November 1987, including the drug
Prozac, which has been linked by some to suicidal thoughts.
   Chiles first became depressed following open-heart surgery in
1985, but that episode didn't require medication, his family
doctor, Karl Hempel of Tallahassee, said Monday.
   ``He's never been suicidal from the very start,'' said Hempel.
Chiles suffered a chemical imbalance causing ``routine depression
with the typical symptoms,'' he said.
   ``I would definitely not tell him to retire,'' said Hempel. ``He
doesn't have anything that is even close to being disabling.''
   Nelson's running mate, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson,
suggested two weeks ago Chiles could be a suicide risk because he
had taken Prozac. Gustafson later apologized for the remark.
   At least two former patients have sued the drug's maker claiming
Prozac caused them to attempt suicide. The manufacturer, Eli Lilly
&amp; Co., has denied the drug has such ill effects.
   Chiles released an inch-thick collection of medical documents
dating back to 1966, which documented a variety of ailments,
including chronic ulcerative colitis and an arthritic spinal
disorder.
   In November 1987, a Naval reserve doctor prescribed the
anti-depressant doxepin after Chiles complained of insomnia, loss
of appetite and sex drive, the records showed. A month later,
Chiles made his announcement he wouldn't seek a fourth Senate term.
   In a report of the evaluation, Dr. R.J. Pentzien, a psychiatrist
at Bethesda Naval Hospital, said Chiles had ``no history of
suicidal ideation, plan or intent,''
   Later, Chiles stopped taking medication for several months,
according to the records.
   Hempel prescribed Prozac for Chiles in December 1989 and he
takes it now.
   While campaigning Monday in southern Florida, Chiles said the
records ``should put an end'' to questions about his health.
   ``I think that my health is perhaps a legitimate issue,'' Chiles
said, adding that his rigorous campaign schedule proved he is fit.

   A gang of convicts from a Siberian
labor camp overpowered their guards aboard an Aeroflot passenger
flight, hijacked the plane to Pakistan and sought political asylum
Monday. No one was hurt.
   One of the convicts apparently smuggled weapons on board in an
artificial limb, the official Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The 11 hijackers surrendered after landing at Karachi
International Airport, and the 29 passengers and nine crew members
were freed unharmed, officials said.
   It was the latest in an unprecedented spate of hijackings
involving Soviet aircraft. There have been at least 13 hijack
attempts in the past three months.
   Airport officials insisting on anonymity said the Tupolev 154
had only five to 15 minutes of fuel left when it landed in Karachi.
The authorities did not say whether the hijackers would be given
asylum or sent back to the Soviet Union.
   The hijacking began Sunday when 15 prisoners were aboard an
Aeroflot flight from Neryungry, about 3,000 miles east of Moscow,
where their labor camp was located. The flight was bound for the
nearby city of Yakutsk in eastern Siberia, officials said.
   It was not known why the prisoners were being taken to Yakutsk,
or why they were serving time in prison.
   The prisoners, armed with guns and homemade explosives,
overpowered their guards and threatened to blow up the plane, said
the independent Soviet news agency Interfax.
   The hijackers forced the plane to return to Neryungry. There,
six prisoners left the plane but two more joined the group,
according to Soviet Interior ministry spokesman Yuri I. Arshenevsky.
   Of the 70 passengers left on board, the hijackers allowed 41
women and children to leave the plane in Neryungry, Arshenevsky
said. Then they flew west to Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, where
authorities negotiated with them for two hours and allowed them to
refuel.
   The plane next flew to Tashkent in Soviet Uzbekistan. There, the
hijackers demanded the aircraft be allowed to leave the country.
   After negotiating through the night, authorities allowed the
plane to be refueled and to take off. The hijackers promised to
free the passengers and crew when they landed, officials said.
   Karachi airport authorities initially denied the jetliner
permission to land but relented when the pilot said he did not have
enough fuel to fly to another destination, officials said.
   The airport was briefly closed but reopened to normal traffic
after the hijacked plane landed, officials said.
   Pakistan is an Islamic country, but authorities said none of the
hijackers was believed to be Moslem.
   There have been at least 13 attempts to hijack Soviet aircraft
since late May, mostly by Soviet teen-agers or young men who said
they wanted to live in the West. That compares with about 70 such
attempts in the 57-year history of Aeroflot, the Soviet state
airline.
   At least six hijackers made it out of the Soviet Union, but all
were arrested. Soviet media emphasized that Western countries have
been returning the hijackers to the Soviet Union to face charges.
Hijacking carries a penalty of five to 20 years in jail in the
Soviet Union.
   Finland on Monday ordered the extradition of Mikhail
Varfolomeyev, who commandeered a Soviet plane on a domestic flight
from the Estonian capital of Tallinn to the Ukrainian city of Lvov.
He sought asylum when the plane landed in Helsinki. Finland
extradited another young Soviet hijacker last month.
   As for Monday's incident, Soviet authorities were trying to
figure out how it happened.
   Tass quoted Deputy Interior Minister Ivan Shilov as saying there
would be an investigation into how the convicts managed to
commandeer the plane.
   ``Such a large group of prisoners should, ideally, be
transported separately, of course,'' he said. ``But chronic
shortages of flights even for ordinary passengers prevent us from
using a special plane.''
   He added that was ``certainly is no justification for what
happened.''

<HEAD>Prison Chairman Wants Review of Human Prey Exercise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel was appointed Monday to review the use of
prison inmates as human prey to train tracking dogs _ a practice
that has drawn criticism from state legislators and others.
   A prison official acknowledged taking two friends on what he
dubbed ``The Ultimate Hunt.''
   ``Both public concern and the media's attention to this subject
warrant a serious review,'' said Charles Terrell, chairman of the
Texas Board of Criminal Justice.
   The practice was criticized after news reports that Jerry Hodge,
vice chairman of the Board of Criminal Justice, participated in the
hunts last year with two friends and later gave them jackets
emblazoned ``The Ultimate Hunt.''
   Hodge has apologized for the jackets but defended his
participation in the hunt, saying the inmates were volunteers and
weren't in danger. Prison officials say they need to use inmates to
teach the dogs to track prison escapees.
   Those on the hunt ride horses, following the dogs as they track
prisoners.
   Terrell is resigning as chairman Sept. 1. Sources told The
Associated Press that Hodge's appointment was to be announced Aug.
14, the same day news of the incident became public.
   Gov. Bill Clements, who called Hodge's actions inappropriate,
denied he had chosen Hodge to replace Terrell. Clements said he
would take the information into consideration in making his
decision, but said he didn't feel it disqualified Hodge.
   Questions about the practice previously surfaced seven years ago
when the lacerated body of an inmate ``dog boy'' was found drowned
in a stock pond, according to former prison board member Harry
Whittington.
   In 1983, a $14,000 out-of-court settlement with the prison
system was reached in a lawsuit involving two inmates that were
attacked by dogs. One man suffered more than 100 bites and the
other 56 bites.
   Prison officials have said protective clothing worn by the
inmates is designed to prevent injury. Medical records show 23 dog
bites suffered by inmates since 1987, according to prison officials.

<TEXT>
   A small group took to the streets Monday
to protest the deployment of U.S. soldiers and sailors in the
Persian Gulf region.
   About 15 people waved signs and lofted a banner in protest of
the U.S. policy in the Middle East at a busy intersection in North
Kingstown, where President Bush made a campaign stop on behalf of
Republicans Gov. Edward D. DiPrete and Rep. Claudine Schneider.
   The president never saw the demonstrators, who took up a post
that his motorcade didn't pass. They moved their protest to
downtown Providence later in the afternoon to catch the rush-hour
crowd passing in front of the federal building.
   ``U.S. troops out of the Middle East. No war for the oil
companies and Wall Street. Money for jobs, homes, schools at home,
not war abroad,'' their banner said.
   They likened the deployment of thousands of U.S. troops, planes
and ships _ intended to protect Saudi Arabia and block trade with
Iraq's because of the Iraqi invasion of neighboring Kuwait _ to the
early stages of the Vietnam war.
   ``We're responding like in 1963 when advisers were sent to
Vietnam,'' said Bill Bateman of the All Peoples Congress. ``This is
the opening shot of an antiwar movement. They're making all the war
moves.''
   Although he conceded it was unlikely that his small protest
would move the United States to reconsider its policy, he argued
that U.S. opposition to the Vietnam War also started small, growing
into a nationwide movement.
   ``They only respond when the numbers grow, when the people start
coming home in body bags,'' he said.
   Another protester, Timothy Sprouls of the Rhode Island Middle
East Committee, said he was particularly opposed to the U.S.
response because of the rapid buildup of forces in the Gulf region.
   ``The United States jumped in there with both feet,'' he said.
``There's been no discussion or dialogue.''

   A pilot whose airplane crashed, killing
him and six relatives, allowed too many passengers in the craft and
may have been flying in stormy weather to meet a license renewal
deadline, authorities said Monday.
   The single-engine plane crashed Saturday night in a cornfield
but wasn't discovered until after the passengers _ members of a
Hmong refugee family attending a birthday party _ were reported
missing Sunday, authorities said.
   The victims were identified Monday as pilot Jay Her, 31, of
Watertown; his two children, Amy, 7, and Tom, 3; his brother,
Yuayia Her, 47, of Sheboygan; Yuayia Her's son, Dani, 11; another
brother, Vang Neng Her, 45, of Watertown; and nephew Vang Yang, 13,
of Milwaukee.
   Relatives said the flight was part of a birthday celebration for
Amy Her.
   ``It was a very close-knit family, a family of three loving
brothers ... now they're all dead,'' said Chao Her, Jay Her's
cousin.
   Relatives said the brothers and other family members fled from
Laos to Thailand at the end of the Vietnam war and later made their
way to Florida before resettling in Wisconsin.
   Her's rented Piper Lance aircraft could carry six people but he
apparently squeezed in an extra child by strapping two youths into
one seat, said William Bruce, an investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   There were severe thunderstorms in the area Saturday night, but
investigators were unsure whether they contributed to the crash,
Bruce said. A preliminary investigation didn't reveal any evidence
of mechancial failure, he said.
   Jefferson County Sheriff Keith Mueller said Her was apparently
trying to earn flight time before a midnight deadline for
recertification of his pilot's license.
   Jeff Baum, manager of the Watertown airport, said Her was a
veteran pilot.
   ``What went through his mind to leave in those weather
conditions and put seven people into a six passenger plane I don't
know,'' said Baum.
   The airport closed at dusk but pilots are authorized to leave
after that. Investigators believed Her took off at about 10 p.m.
   He hadn't filed a flight plan, authorities said.
   The wreckage was found amid six-foot high cornstalks in a field
near the airport.
   The plane apparently crashed after its left wing struck the
ground, causing the plane to cartwheel, Bruce said.

<HEAD>Congressman Pleads Innocent to Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KILEY ARMSTRONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Floyd Flake pleaded innocent Monday to
conspiracy, fraud and tax evasion charges stemming from allegations
he diverted money from programs of the church where he is pastor.
   After the arraignment, the two-term Democrat assured 250
supporters he will be vindicated at trial.
   Flake, 45, was indicted Aug. 2 on 17 counts of conspiracy, fraud
and tax evasion. His wife, Margarett, 42, was indicted on nine
counts.
   Lawyers entered pleas for them at a five-minute court appearance
before U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson in Brooklyn. Neither
Flake nor his wife spoke; but they stood erect, looking confident
throughout the proceeding.
   The judge released them in their own custody and scheduled the
next hearing for October.
   Afterward, Flake thanked the applauding supporters as he left
the courthouse.
   ``I am not guilty,'' he told them. ``My record speaks for
itself.''
   The supporters had arrived in chartered buses; many were from
the Allen African Methodist Church in the borough of Queens, where
Flake is the pastor. Some carried signs, including one that read:
``Come, see the great work he has done.''
   ``The indictment was ridiculous for a man of his caliber,'' said
Gregory Meeks, an attorney. ``Congressman Flake is a great man;
he's proven it by his deeds,'' said another demonstrator who
identified himself only as Tony.
   Flake, who represents New York's 6th Congressional District, was
charged with diverting $141,700 from church and housing funds for
his own use, and for failing to report it as taxable income.
   The charges center on the 300-unit Allen Senior Citizens
Apartments, which Flake's church built in 1981 with a $10 million
federal loan.
   The church operates the complex with a $100,000 monthly subsidy
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987, the Flakes embezzled
$75,000 from the complex.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney said the money was siphoned off in
$6,000 increments from quarterly HUD allocations of $9,000, set
aside for transporting the elderly residents to and from
appointments in the neighborhood. He said the actual transportation
costs were only $3,000 a quarter.
   The indictment also alleged that Flake took another $66,700 from
a special church ``ministerial expense fund'' for his own use
between 1983 and 1988, and again did not report the money as
taxable income.
   Maloney said church members were unaware of Flake's activities.
   When he was indicted, Flake's attorney, Gustave Newman, said the
money was used for church purposes and the charges wouldn't stand
up in court.
   He also said the case would not affect Flake's plans to run for
a third term this year.
   Mrs. Flake's attorney, Ted Wells, said his client was only a
secretary, the person who signed tax forms and checks. He said she
had ``no substantive involvement'' in church operations.
   The charges included one count of conspiracy, two counts of
fraud and six counts of tax evasion against each of the defendants.
Flake was additionally charged with another four counts of filing
false tax returns and four counts of making false financial
statements.
   If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake would face a maximum of 87
years in prison and fines of up to nearly $4 million. His wife
would face maximum penalties of 55 years in prison and $2.1 million
in fines.

   A gunman shooting wildly while
holed up in a mobile home for 10 hours wounded two sheriff's
deputies and apparently killed three people inside the home before
surrendering Monday, authorities said.
   Heinz Joachim Podszuweit, 30, described as a survivalist with a
military background, was arrested at 9:05 a.m. after keeping a
Riverside County Sheriff's Department special weapons team at bay
since late Sunday.
   Inside the home, deputies found three bodies as well as a
high-powered rifle and hand grenades, said Detective Henry Sawicki.
   ``It appears we have an individual who went mentally over the
brink,'' said Sheriff Cois Byrd. Speaking of the deaths inside the
mobile home, he added, ``it appears there was some kind of
conflict.''
   The names of the dead weren't immediately available.
   The shooting began about 11:30 p.m. Sunday when deputies
responding to neighbor complaints were met with gunfire, Sawicki
said.
   One deputy was shot in the foot; another grazed on the shoulder.

<HEAD>News Rules Said To Protect Soldiers' Families, Secure Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boundaries on what information American
journalists in Saudi Arabia can relay home are in place to protect
soldiers' families and to ensure against tipping off the Iraqis, a
Pentagon official said Aug. 15.
   One of the ground rules prevents journalists from disclosing the
size of troop units or where they are located in the desert in the
dispatches that are shared with the nation's news media on a
``pool'' basis.
   ``That's the kind of stuff the Iraqis would love to know ... You
might as well be giving them grid coordinates to set their
artillery for,'' said the official, who is helping to handle the
pool coverage from Washington. He asked to remain unidentified.
   Another restriction on the 15-member pool of U.S. journalists,
flown to Saudi Arabia by the Pentagon, prohibits them from
identifying individual soldiers _ except command-level officers _
by name.
   That rule is in place to protect the GIs' families in the United
States, the Pentagon official said.
   ``You have people who don't much care for the fact that we're
there in the first place and who want to strike back at a target,''
he said.
   Allowing the journalists to report how many troops are gathering
at a certain spot would be ``giving the enemy, the potential enemy,
information that is better left unsaid at this point,'' the
official said.
   Photographers are not prevented from taking pictures of anything
they see, but a group of U.S. military ``escorts'' control where
the pool reporters and photographers are taken each day.
   ``If they are taken to an object or a human being, they are not
being prevented from taking pictures of anything,'' the official
said.
   A military official does a ``security review'' of the stories
before they are dispatched to the reporter's Washington bureau.
Then a Pentagon official in Washington gives it a final review
before it is allowed to be distributed by wire services and to
other news organizations.
   ABC's Sam Donaldson accidentally violated the rules by
specifying the location of an airbase used by U.S. warplanes and
got a warning from his U.S military escort.
   ``He made an honest mistake'' and hasn't repeated it, ABC News
vice president Robert Murphy said of Donaldson's goof. It occurred
Aug. 15 during his live ``Nightline'' report from the airbase in
Saudi Arabia.
   ABC said a tape of his report, with the location electronically
bleeped out, aired the next night on ``PrimeTime Live,'' which
Donaldson co-anchors with Diane Sawyer.
   The pool in Saudi Arabia includes seven print reporters from The
Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, the Scripps Howard News
Service, the Milwaukee Journal, United Press International, Reuters
and Time magazine.
   It also includes a National Public Radio reporter, still
photographers from the AP, UPI and Time and a CNN television crew.

<HEAD>Group of Americans and Britons Flee Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHAFJI, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Journalists and others who fled
Kuwait after the Iraqi attack told stories of wandering in the
desert while trying to elude the invading army.
   Stephanie McGehee, an American stringer for The Associated
Press, was in a convoy of cars that fled Aug. 17 after Britons and
Americans were ordered to gather at two Kuwait hotels.
   ``It was a hectic, rather perilous drive past Iraqi checkpoints
and through uninhabited desert regions between Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia,'' McGehee, of Leucadia, Calif., said by telephone from the
Khafji border post.
   She and other foreigners decided to take their chances in the
desert rather than risk becoming hostages in Baghdad.
   McGehee, who had lived 12 years in Lebanon and Kuwait, said she
donned a black, floor-length robe of the sort worn by Kuwaiti women
and used her knowledge of Arabic dialects to talk her way past
Iraqi troops.
   ``It seems the Iraqis got the impression the entire convoy
comprised only Arab evacuees,'' she said. ``I spoke at length in
Arabic with a mixture of Kuwaiti and Lebanese accents to the Iraqis
at the last checkpoint.''
   The ploy seemed to work at first and none of the other cars were
checked. But the Iraqi troops suddenly told the party to return
home.
   They moved a few miles back toward Kuwait, then veered into the
desert and kept driving until they saw some Bedouins who pointed to
the Saudi border.
   A Dutch journalist who escaped from Kuwait on Aug. 14 said she
met others who wandered the desert seeking a way out.
   ``They were loaded into cars, buses, trucks _ anything that
moved,'' said Hetty Lubberding, a correspondent for Dutch radio.
   Ms. Lubberding said her three-car convoy of British and Irish
citizens was turned back at the border crossing like thousands of
other vehicles. They then headed into the desert to meet a Bedouin
who was supposed to lead them to safety.
   They had not planned to travel across the desert and so had
brought little water or other supplies. No Bedouins were in sight
and the group was soon lost, unable to find their way back to
Kuwait City, about 24 miles to the north.
   ``Lots of other people were wandering around lost,'' Ms.
Lubberding said. Her convoy picked up several Egyptians whose car
got stuck.
   They fell in behind some Filipinos who had been pointed across
the desert toward the Saudi border by an Iraqi patrol.
   Nerves strained, they came face-to-face with an Iraqi tank.
Having heard reports that a Briton was shot trying to cross, their
first instinct was to run.
   ``We were a little wary, but we decided to approach,'' she said.
   The Iraqi soldiers on the tank gave them water and pointed the
way, she said, sending them to a Saudi border post.

<HEAD>Closed Society, Heat Make Reporting Difficult in Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western reporters are finding that
the challenge of reporting in a society that has been virtually
closed to foreigners until now is as daunting as working in heat
that often soars above 100 degrees.
   The Saudi government allowed U.S. Defense Department officials
to chaperone a small pool of reporters in the country the week
after the invasion. It wasn't until a week later that the kingdom
agreed to grant visas for open coverage to more than a dozen
journalists.
   Habib Shaheen, a spokesman for the Saudi government, said the
number of reporters in the country was unprecedented.
   On Aug. 18, the Saudi government flew reporters to Jiddah, 1,000
miles away, for interviews with top officials.
   Ever sensitive to the draw of television, the government
arranged for NBC's Tom Brokaw, ABC's Sam Donaldson and CBS' Bob
Simon to have individual interviews with the Saudi oil minister and
the foreign minister.
   ``Very smooth,'' Donaldson pronounced after his 10 minutes with
Prince Saud al-Faisal, the foreign minister. Al-Faisal, clad in his
traditional flowing robe and red headdress, spoke in flawless
English as he recounted Saudi Arabia's insistence that Iraqi troops
leave Kuwait.
   The Saudis' decision to open their borders awed some reporters
who until now have spent years trying to penetrate the kingdom.
   ``We would wait forever just to get one interview and now we
have three top officials in one day,'' said Barnie Mason of BBC
radio.
   The logistics for covering the news are formidable.
   CNN's Carl Rochelle was a pool reporter who flew to Saudi Arabia
with Defense Department staff. Once in the country, he and his
technicians had to set up a portable satellite station at the
Dhahran Air Base.
   The heat was so intense that one technician was overcome and
military officials were forced to install an air conditioner in a
tent.
   ``We've learned to drink a lot of water,'' said Tom Mote, a CNN
cameraman.

<HEAD>Settlement Preserves Independence of Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Times Publishing Co. settled a
stock feud with Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass that company
officials said preserved independent control of the St. Petersburg
Times.
   The publishing company agreed to recapitalization, including
redemption of its preferred stock, the parties announced in a joint
statement Aug. 17. In return the Bass group is dismissing its suit
against the Times.
   ``The agreement assures the long-term independence, journalistic
control and competitive vigor of the St. Petersburg Times, as well
as significant ongoing support for the Poynter Institute,'' said
Andrew Barnes, chairman of Times Publishing.
   David Bonderman, managing partner for the Bass group,
Poynter-Jamison Ventures Ltd., said the settlement was in
everyone's best interest. The partnership includes the nieces of
the late Eleanor Poynter Jamison, sister of founder Nelson Poynter,
who ran the paper for 30 years.
   ``We always believed this to be a good investment and are happy
we could work with Andy Barnes to help end a family dispute that
has brewed for years,'' Bonderman said.
   Earlier this year, the Bass group made a $270 million buyout
offer for Times Publishing Co., parent firm of the newspaper,
Congressional Quarterly and other magazines.
   The Bass group owned 40 percent of the voting stock but got only
5.7 percent of the dividends of Times Publishing Co. under an
unusual stock arrangement.
   The partnership sought a better return on its investment and
maintained directors had an obligation to recall preferred stock,
as allowed by bylaws, at $106 a share or $318,000.
   But the Times defended the stock arrangement as beneficial to
the journalistic standards of the newspaper and the health of the
Poynter Institute, which essentially controls the newspaper. The
institute offers education and national conferences to journalists
and students.
   As a result of the settlement, the publishing company is
incurring debt, said Barnes, who is editor and president of the
Times. The debt should not affect operations, said Barnes, who also
is chairman of the Poynter Institute and chief executive officer of
the Times Holding Co.
   Nelson Poynter, who ran the paper for 30 years, had set up a
unique way to keep a profitable daily newspaper in the hands of
journalists, free from control of outsiders or even his family. He
established the not-for-profit journalism school, which ultimately
is the major stockholder of the newspaper.
   Times Publishing is owned largely by Times Holding Co., which in
turn is owned almost entirely by the non-profit Poynter Institute
for Media Studies.
   State Attorney General Bob Butterworth had intervened in the
suit on behalf of the Poynter Institute, which he said was
threatened by the Bass partnership.
   Butterworth said he was pleased with the settlement, but
disturbed by the agreement by the parties not to comment on terms
or related matters.
   ``This office will take whatever steps are available to ensure
that the state has sufficient information to determine that the
settlement, in fact, does not have an adverse impact on the Poynter
Institute's beneficiaries, including the state university system
and Tampa Bay-area public schools,'' he said.

<HEAD>UPI Laying Off 31</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International will lay off 31
employees, transfer others and leave some small news bureaus with
no staff as part of a series of organizational changes, the news
agency said Aug. 14.
   Washington-based UPI said it is also negotiating to purchase the
use of the news report of States News Service as part of a joint
venture intended to supplement its own coverage of the federal
government.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps said four regional reporters who had
been tailoring reports of federal news for individual states and
regions will be assigned other duties.
   He said UPI's coverage on Capitol Hill will not otherwise be
affected.
   Capps said the layoffs involve 16 regular employees and 15
probationary staff members in UPI bureaus around the country.
   The Washington Post said the wire service plans to eliminate
one-person bureaus in Green Bay, Wis.; Scranton, Pa.; Atlantic
City, N.J.; Springfield, Mass., and Fairfax County, Va.
   Capps confirmed that reporting of news in nearby Fairfax County
will now be handled by UPI's Washington bureau but said he would
not address other details.
   He did say that although some of the news bureaus are not now
being staffed, UPI has not closed them and retains the option of
reassigning reporters to them.
   ``We aren't reducing any of our coverage in those areas,'' Capps
said. ``We do not consider that there will be any substantive
change in our reporting from those regions.''
   He said the changes are part of a long-term strategy aimed at
trimming personnel costs while sharing news reporting with
joint-venture partners, including Financial News Network, a cable
television network.
   UPI is owned by Infotechnology Inc., which also owns 47 percent
of FNN.
   ``Our aim is to free up additional resources to differentiate
UPI's reports from those of our competitors in ways that cannot be
easily duplicated,'' Capps said.

<HEAD>Editorial Calling for Drug Legalization Draws Criticism, Support</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A San Francisco Examiner editorial urging
legalization of drugs was yet another blow to the United States'
drug policy, law enforcement officials say.
   ``Let's face it: No amount of laws, no amount of interdiction,
no amount of courts, no amount of jails, no amount of anything has
reduced the craving for the use of drugs,'' the Aug. 12 editorial
read.
   It said all anti-drug laws should be repealed and the war on
drugs called off.
   ``For these people to make statements like this, I think they
are very uninformed. They are making it from a philosophical point
of view that I don't think takes into consideration those who are
actively involved in the problem,'' said Robert Bender, Drug
Enforcement Agency agent in charge in San Francisco.
   In San Jose, where police say 80 percent of serious crime is
drug-related, Police Chief Joseph McNamara said he agreed with some
of the newspaper's arguments.
   ``Many of the points in the editorial are valid,'' McNamara
said. ``The tremendous corruption, the clogging of courts, jails
and prisons indicate we need to look for new solutions. But I don't
think the country is ready for legalization.''

   The public service advertisements have been running in the
30,000-circulation Lake Worth Herald since July, with blanks to
fill in people's names, addresses and alleged criminal activities.
   Herald Editor Jay Kravetz has forwarded eight names to the
police since the campaign began. He said he got the idea after
reading about similar ads in other newspapers.
   ``I wish that everybody would call the police who ran into or
saw a crime,'' said Kravetz, ``But they don't. This is for people
who don't want to call police.''
   Lake Worth Police Lt. Jack Garson said the tips have
supplemented some cases but have not led to any arrests.
   James K. Green, legal director of the American Civil Liberties
Union in Florida, said the practice ``raises some disturbing
questions.''
   ``What kind of a society do we want to live in _ a society of
informers? Or do we want to leave that to the police?'' Green
asked. ``It's not the function of a free press to act as a patsy to
law enforcement.''
   But supporters, such as Shirley M. Campfield of the Lake Worth
Concerned Citizens, said the coupons are an excellent
crime-fighting tool.
   ``It has a lot to do with where Lake Worth is at the moment,''
Campfield said. ``Some aggression is called for to get us over the
hump.''
   The newspaper can put pressure on police to investigate when the
same names keep turning up, she said. ``A lot of people complain
that they talk to the police and nothing happens.''

   The owners of The Indiana Gazette marked the
newspaper's centennial Aug. 13 with a $20,000 donation to a
children's program at a city library.
   Joseph L. and Lucy Ray Donnelly said the family made the
donation in memory of Mrs. Donnelly's father, R. Hastie Ray, who
ran the paper from 1911 until 1970.
   The gift will help add a children's section to the Indiana Free

<HEAD>Newspaper Blows Lid off Tupperware `Secret'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peoria Journal Star popped the lid off
Tupperware's secret new product for 1990, and the plastic
kitchenware giant is steamed.
   The newspaper reported Aug. 15 that Tupperware's ``revolutionary
new product line'' is a group of stackable microwave dishes.
   ``The paper really did a number on us,'' said Alan Luce,
Tupperware vice president for administration. ``This was a major
product breakthrough for us. It was not like a new tumbler or
color. This was a major secret.''
   The new line was to have been unveiled nationally Aug. 27. But
the newspaper got a reporter inside a closed session of a
Tupperware convention Aug. 14 when the product was introduced to a
jubilant crowd of dealers and sales managers.
   Luce said the story ``ruined the fun, surprise and excitement''
for conventioneers attending sessions later in the week in Peoria,
Long Beach, Calif., and Orlando, Fla.
   ``We've got 110,000 independent Tupperware dealers in the United
States. We prefer that they know about our new products before the
general public knows,'' said Lawrie Pitcher Platt, spokeswoman at
Tupperware headquarters in Orlando.
   Mayor Jim Maloof said his secretary received several calls from
upset Tupperware officials. He said he called the newspaper to ask
if the story could be pulled from its evening editions. The paper
refused.
   ``I don't understand what's the big deal. They had news, and we
went and got it,'' said Jack Brimeyer, assistant managing editor.
``We didn't treat them any differently than any other business or
news story.''
   The mayor also said he had heard Tupperware had threatened to
cancel its three-year contract to hold conventions in Peoria.
   The company plans to hold its 1991 convention in Hawaii for
Tupperware's 40th anniversary, but Luce said that had nothing to do
with the Tupperware flap.
   The new line is called Tupperwave. It's a nine-piece selection
of casserole-type dishes and accessories that can be stacked
three-high in a microwave to allow simultaneous cooking of entrees,
side dishes and desserts.

<HEAD>First Soviet Newspapers Registered Under Freer Rules; But Prices
Rising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers have begun registering under new, freer
press regulations that replaced tough censorship.
   All publications will be permitted except those urging the
violent overthrow of the government, promoting racial or religious
intolerance or publishing propaganda for war, violence or cruelty,
according to the law.
   None of the old or new national publications applying for
registration has been turned away, Dmitri Mamleyev, first deputy
chairman of the State Press Committee, told a news conference Aug.
14.
   The same day, the committee also announced a doubling in the
price of many publications, blaming increases in the cost of paper,
printing equipment and transportation.
   Some politicians have called the increases an attack on
glasnost, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaign for greater
openness.
   The popular magazine Ogonyok, which now costs 40 kopecks at the
newstand, will rise to about 1 ruble _ more than double its price.
The price of books also is expected to more than double, officials
said.
   Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the largest Soviet republic,
Russia, told speakers at a meeting in the northern Russian city of
Vorkuta on Aug. 13 that the Soviet parliament had been too easy on
the Communications Ministry.
   ``We should have taken it under control. ... We'll return to the
issue and after that they will probably stop their attacks on
glasnost,'' Yeltsin said in remarks reported by the Interfax news
agency, an arm of Radio Moscow.
   Press committee officials in Moscow said the Communications
Ministry is billions of rubles in debt because of the increases in
production costs.
   They also said newstand prices could remain the same if the
unions and other groups that publish periodicals were willing to
sacrifice their profits to cover the increases.
   More than 120 newspapers and other Soviet news organizations
have applied under the new press law, which was approved
unanimously by the Supreme Soviet in June after months of debate
and took effect Aug. 1.
   To establish a publication or news organization, Soviets need
only provide their name, address, frequency of publication,
circulation figures and source of financing.

   Two soldiers have been given suspended
sentences and fined for beating a news photographer in the occupied
West Bank, the army said.
   Havakuk Levinson, who worked for the Reuters news agency, was
beaten March 22 when he tried to photograph troops firing at

   One soldier was convicted of ``shameful conduct'' and received a
three-month suspended sentence on Aug. 15. He was fined $100, the

   A first sergeant major was convicted of ``improper conduct.'' He
received a five-month suspended sentence and was ordered to pay
$250.
   Another soldier was convicted earlier of assault and improper
conduct. He was ordered to spend two months doing manual labor and
placed on probation for an additional four months. He was also
reduced in rank from staff sergeant to private, the army said.

<HEAD>Press Institute Asks Chile To Protect Threatened Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Press Institute asked the
government of Chile to protect four leftist journalists who have
been threatened by right-wing extremists in that country.
   The London-based institute, which represents journalists,
editors and publishers around the world, made the request Aug. 14
in a letter to Interior Minister Enrique Krauss.
   The four journalists received written threats on July 30 and 31
from a previously unknown right-wing group calling itself the
Gabriel Rodriguez Alcaino Command, the letter said.
   ``We urge that every possible step be taken to investigate these
threats and to locate and apprehend those responsible,'' said the
letter, signed by Peter Galliner, the institute's director.
   The letter identified the threatened journalists as
editors-in-chief Manuel Cabieses Donoso of Punto Final, Libio Perez
of Pagina Abierta, Juan Andres Lagos of El Siglo, and its general
editor, Guillermo Torres.
   All three publications are connected to Chile's radical left.
   Punto Final is a biweekly magazine that represents the views of
the Revolutionary Left Movement. Its editor-in-chief, Cabieses, was
arrested after the 1973 military coup that ousted leftist Salvador
Allende. He said that while in detention he suffered severe
torture. Cabieses was sent into exile abroad and has since returned
to Chile.
   El Siglo is the official publication of Chile's Communist Party.
Torres is also a director of the Chilean Journalists Association.
   The Chilean government has strongly condemned the threats and
said it would take appropriate measures.

<HEAD>Network Anchor Buildup in Middle East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. network anchorman buildup in the Middle
East continued Aug. 16 as both ABC's Sam Donaldson and NBC's Tom
Brokaw reported for duty in Saudi Arabia.
   Brokaw, anchorman of ``NBC Nightly News,'' and Donaldson,
co-anchor of ``PrimeTime Live,'' flew to Saudi Arabia the day
before, raising to seven the number of network anchors sent to
report on the Middle East crisis.
   ``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather, who entered Iraq on Aug.
15, has been reporting from the Middle East since Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait sparked the crisis.
   ABC ``Nightline'' anchor Ted Koppel became the first U.S.
network correspondent allowed into Iraq, on Aug. 14. He flew back
to Jordan two days later, but ``World News Sunday'' anchor Forrest
Sawyer remained in Baghdad, ABC said.
   On Aug. 17, however, the ABC crew was told it could no longer
make satellite TV transmissions and had to leave the country.
Rather and CBS correspondent Allen Pizzey were allowed to remain,
at least until Aug. 20.
   Garrick Utley, co-anchor of NBC's ``Sunday Today,'' flew to the
Middle East the week after the invasion, and ``CBS This Morning''
co-anchor Harry Smith went to Cairo Aug. 13. Smith returned to New
York after a week, while NBC ``Today'' anchor Bryant Gumbel began
reporting from Saudi Arabia on Aug. 20.

<HEAD>Network Middle East Coverage Boosts Ratings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The networks' coverage of the Middle East crisis
in the week following the Iraqi invasion boosted ratings for their
evening newscasts by 19 percent and gave them a larger average
audience than prime-time entertainment shows.
   The increase was due to public interest in the news from the
Middle East and U.S. military movements there, NBC research vice
president Preston Beckman said Aug. 14.
   CBS, NBC and ABC evening newcasts collectively averaged a 28.8
rating and a 60 percent share of the audience last week, compared
with a 28.1 rating and 53 share for prime time programs, Nielsen
audience estimates showed.
   ABC's front-running ``World News Tonight'' averaged a 10.6
rating. ``The CBS Evening News,'' whose anchor, Dan Rather, has
been in the Middle East since Iraq's Aug. 2 in invasion of Kuwait,
averaged a 9.3. ``NBC Nightly News'' ran third with an 8.9 average.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes. The audience share
is the estimated percentage of homes tuned to a given program in
its time period.
   ABC research vice president Alan Wurtzel said that it's rare for
news ratings to do better than entertainment ratings. He attributed
the ratings both to viewer interest in the crisis and ``the summer
doldrums in prime time viewing.''
   CNN officials said their network's ratings had generally
doubled; the newscasts were seen in 763,000 homes Friday night, and
659,000 homes on Sunday.
   Viewers of Monday night's network newscasts saw the first TV
footage from a press pool flown out to the carrier Independence in
the Gulf of Oman.
   CBS anchorman Rather, among the correspondents on the big ship,
taped his anchor portion of the ``CBS Evening News'' there.
   Although the TV correspondents had to share pool video footage
shot by a network cameraman, Rather's report included a home-video
segment taped by an unidentified sailor. It showed Rather touring
the ship and interviewing crewmen.
   While in the ship's boiler room, Rather, using a microphone
attached to the sailor's videocamera, told viewers: ``(`Top Gun'
star) Tom Cruise doesn't make movies about this place.''
   ``Hi, Mom and Dad,'' said one grinning young sailor as Rather
held the microphone up for him.
   Under press pool rules, CBS had to share Rather's home-video
footage, some of which was fuzzy and taken in poor light. But there
were no takers, spokesmen for the other networks said. The quality
wasn't good, said David Miller, NBC's foreign news editor: ``I
thought it was shabby.''

<HEAD>Gulf States Plan Kuwait News Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Persian Gulf countries have
agreed to devote prime television time to a program produced by the
exiled government of Kuwait.
   The agreement was reached Aug. 15 by the ministers of Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, members
of the Gulf Cooperation Council with Kuwait.
   Kuwait's government fled when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, set
up a provisional government and declared it had ``annexed'' the
oil-rich country. The U.N. Security Council said the annexation was
``null and void.''
   The Kuwaiti government-in-exile now operates from a base in the
Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.
   An official statement said the information ministers met in
emergency session on how to respond to the Iraqi invasion.
   The statement said the ``State of Kuwait'' would prepare a
special TV program that would be broadcast daily from the other
countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council after the main daily news
bulletins.

<HEAD>Union Files Unfair Labor Charge Against NBC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A technical union at NBC has filed a petition
with the National Labor Relations Board accusing the network of
unfair labor practices. NBC denies the accusations.
   The charges by the National Association of Broadcast Employees
and Technicians were filed Aug. 15, the same day NBC put in effect
a four-year contract proposal that a majority of the union's
members at NBC have rejected twice.
   The union, which represents 2,373 employees at NBC and NBC-owned
facilities, accused the company of ``failing and refusing to
bargain in good faith.'' Its previous contract expired on March 31.
   ``NBC has fully met its obligations under the National Labor
Relations Act,'' said NBC spokesman Joe Rutledge, who said the
company's final offer came after more than seven months of
negotiations and 35 separate meetings.
   ``We're confident that just as when NABET filed a similar
complaint in 1987, the NLRB will find the charges without merit.''
   The 1987 charge was filed during a bitter strike by the union
that lasted 17 weeks. No walkout this time is imminent. No strike
vote has been taken and union officials say they'll probably go to
court to fight NBC's action.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission is
investigating complaints against a public television station that
showed nude photographs taken by Robert Mapplethorpe.
   WGBH included the photos in a 10 p.m. newscast July 31, the day
before Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art opened an exhibit of
Mapplethorpe's work.
   At least three people have complained to the FCC, including
Donald Wildman of the American Family Association in Tupelo, Miss.,
who sent a videotape of the broadcast to the FCC.
   Roger Holberg, an FCC attorney, said the agency has not
determined whether there is enough of a case to warrant contacting
the station.
   WGBH may be partially protected because the broadcast was after
8 p.m., when the FCC does not enforce indecency rules. But the
broadcast could be investigated for obscenity, which is treated
differently under federal law, Holberg said.
   Eric Brass, attorney for WGBH, disputed the complaints.
   ``It just is not obscene,'' he said. ``I believe we have the
right to do what we did in the context of a serious news program.
We cannot be in the position of censoring debate about censorship.
That's what it would come down to.''

<HEAD>TBS Reports $44 Million Loss on Goodwill Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said Aug. 14 it
lost $44 million on the Goodwill Games, which caused the company to
post a second-quarter loss of $8.3 million.
   The loss on the Goodwill Games ``masked the better-than-planned
performance of our ongoing operations,'' TBS chairman Ted Turner
said in a statement.
   The loss included a failure to deliver audience level guarantees
to advertisers who bought time on the TBS Superstation for the
televising of the Games. Turner said it would provide compensatory
advertising time for future programming on its other cable TV
networks.
   Turner said during the recent games in Seattle that the
quadrennial international sporting event could lose $26 million,
twice what had been projected. That fueled speculation that the
Games, which Turner developed in 1985 to foster better relations
between nations, might be doomed.
   The first Goodwill Games, in 1986, lost $26 million.
   Kitsie Riggall, a TBS spokeswoman, maintained that it would be
premature to say the event was finished.
   ``We've been saying all along that the board (of directors) will
review the Games at a future date and will make a decision,''
Riggall said.
   ``They will review these numbers as well as the Games itself . .
. its value to the cable industry, the gains it made with the
athletic community. There are several things to look at,'' she said.
   Turner said earlier this month he expected the board to decide
by the end of September whether to continue TBS' involvement in the
Games.

<HEAD>Camp Rerun Closes as Fall Season Approaches</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The following is a transcript of the final
session at Camp Rerun, a minimum-security installation where TV
critics are sent each summer for refresher courses on how to do
their thing.
   All right, people, listen up. This is our final chance to review
lessons learned, what to do with old videocassettes and how to
cover the people covering a story, like anchormen. Questions?
   Q: What's ``Twin Peaks'' about?
   A: A surreal, postmodern seriocomic drama about the somber belly
of American life. Part of David Lynch's brooding, complex oeuvre,
it is at once darkly comic and brilliantly bleak.
   Q: That makes no sense.
   A: I know, but if you write that way often enough they'll
promote you to movie critic.
   Q: Who killed Laura Palmer?
   A: You, sir, are a geek.
   Q: What is the Middle East?
   A: A large, dusty, oil-rich kingdom ruled on a rotating basis by
three kings. The kings are Ted Koppel, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw,
although we see in People magazine that King Dan is mad at King Tom.
   Q: What are the ramifications of this?
   A: Hard to say. But we hear that King Tom's producer just got a
very big blowgun. And now he's trying to find a heat-seeking
missile to put in it. I don't know why.
   Q: What is this ``double-pump'' thing of NBC?
   A: They are having double premieres this month of some of their
new shows before the new season starts next month. I think they're
trying to whip up excitement, not to mention confusion.
   Q: I have a problem with one show, ``Working It Out.'' NBC sent
me a review cassette. But now NBC says ``the character of Gail has
been replaced by a new actress and scenes will be re-shot for air.''
   A: So what's the problem?
   Q: How can I review a show where the character of Gail has been
replaced by a new actress?
   A: Just write, ``in this performance, the character of Gail will
be played by Laura Palmer.''
   Q: I've heard that the new network series are going to be a lot
bolder this year, particularly with the language in shows like
``Raw Sex'' and ``More Raw Sex'' and ``Unsolved Adulteries.''
   A: I know what you mean. I saw that ``Unsolved Adulteries''
episode where the guy says, ``Boy, I'm sure hot, Martha.''
   Q: How can we warn our readers?
   A: Just do what the networks do. Say portions of this show may
not be suitable for yuppies.
   Q: Tell me again, what do you say when reviewing a boring
24-part PBS series about a British spinster and a Burmese doctor in
Nepal?
   A: You write, ``Richly-textured, always compelling, this is
splendid television.'' That's how they do it in New York.
   Q: Should we keep trying to interview Bryant Gumbel?
   A: Sure, but if he still says no, remember that you are to keep
referring to ``Today'' as ``the troubled show'' or ``still mired in
second.''
   Q: Should we bother to review all those fishing shows on cable?
You know, the kind where some pot-bellied guy talks about his Hula
Popper and says, ``Whooo, looks like that crappie weighs 'bout 10,
11 pounds easy.''
   A: Ignore those shows. They'll all out-dated by a new one coming
out this fall. It's called ``Bass Fishing With Dynamite Dan.''
   Q: Should we still do stories about new trends in television?
I'm getting tired of making up new trends in television.
   A: No, your readers want to know about new trends in television,
particularly if they're having trouble sleeping. Incidentally, you
might keep an eye on a new trend the Middle East crisis has caused.
There are more Middle East experts than ever before on the morning
news shows.
   Q: I know what you mean. I saw one the other day from the Center
for Strategic Studies of Strategic Centers.
   A: Well, we're just about out of time. I hope you've enjoyed
your stay at Camp Rerun. I also hope we've helped you think about
this incredible medium called television and its profound impact on
American life.
   Q: Could you tell me again, what is the Middle East?

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Darkman,'' ``Pump Up the Volume''</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ``Darkman'' opens wide Aug. 24; ``Pump Up the Volume'' opens
Aug. 24 at 800 theaters across the country.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   ``Darkman'' _
   With little fanfare and none of the intrusive hype that heralded
``Batman'' and ``Dick Tracy,'' a tidy comic-book fantasy-thriller
from Universal Pictures will fill screens across the nation on Aug.
24, and if you're smart, you'll get in line right now.
   At a fraction of the budget, ``Darkman'' is what ``Dick Tracy''
could have been without turning over the movie to the non-talents
of Madonna and ignoring plot and action, or what ``Batman'' should
have been without all the pretense and Joker-mania. It's a simple
story of good vs. evil, seen through the talented lens of Bill
Pope, with sure-fire direction from Sam Raimi (``The Evil Dead'')
and the kind of special effects you only visualize in action comic
books.
   Dr. Peyton Westlake (Liam Neeson) is on the brink of perfecting
synthetic skin _ skin that can take on the features of any
photograph fed into a computer. The only problem is that when
exposed to light, the skin disintegrates after 100 minutes.
Meanwhile, his true love, Julia (Frances McDormand), a lawyer,
discovers a memo linking her client, a real estate tycoon, to the
mob.
   Westlake is visited by a brutal team of hitmen who seek the memo
and silence. Led by the slimey and vicious Robert G. Durant (Larry
Drake), who likes to snip off the fingers of his victims with his
cigar slicer and add to his digit collection at home, the killers
bash Westlake through several glass cabinets, beat him, shoot him,
dunk his head in a vat of acid and leave him a mangled mess after
turning up the gas and lighting a flame to destroy their handiwork.
   The explosion propels Westlake through the window of his lab
like a firey torpedo. The effect is stunning.
   As far as the world is concerned, Westlake is dead. He emerges
at the local hospital as a John Doe, so badly burned that the
doctor clips a vital nerve to alleviate pain. Only problem, the
procedure leaves Westlake with superhuman powers and a rage the
size of Texas.
   He somehow manages to recreate his lab and make enough skin to
get him through several revenge killings and then some.
   Westlake becomes Darkman, a combo Phantom of the Opera-Amazing
Hulk. With the chameleon charms of his synthetic skin, he can look
like anybody.
   The action is nonstop and inspired. And for once, a screenplay
with five names attached isn't an abomination. It's plump with wit
and pathos, and has an eerie override.
   The story is by Raimi, whose claim to fame is ``The Evil Dead,''
a Cannes Film Festival cult classic. However, Raimi shows enormous
talent with his kinetic camera work and angled shots, and he has a
skilled companion with Pope, who makes his feature film debut with
``Darkman.''
   Neeson, who has given solid performances in ``Suspect,'' ``The
Mission'' and ``The Good Mother,'' offers a multi-faceted portrayal
with Westlake. There is compassion, sensuality, intellect, horror.
   There are good support performances from Drake, who plays the
retarded Benny on TV's ``L.A. Law'' and is the sadistic thug in
this movie, and McDormand, the abused sheriff's wife from
``Mississippi Burning.'' Her genuine goodness is never cloying.
   ``Darkman'' is a visionary epiphany of man's inhumanity to man,
the perils of greed, the tests of love and loyality. It is a
fantasy world of horror, creation and destruction. And it's a
full-throttled blast of a ride.
   Produced by Robert Tapert, ``Darkman'' is rated R for graphic
violence.

   ``Pump Up the Volume'' _
   Contrary to common belief _ and some earnest hopes _ the youth
movie is not dead. The once-thriving genre makes a comeback in
``Pump Up the Volume,'' a watchable film of surprising energy.
Adults may well need to steel themselves for another wave of movies
based on the time-worn theme, ``My parents don't understand me.''
   ``Pump Up the Volume'' (and it does) is generally effective,
thanks to a high-wattage performance by Christian Slater. His
performance before a radio microphone matches the electricity of
Eric Begosian in Oliver Stone's neglected ``Talk Radio.''
   Slater is an Easterner whose parents have moved to Arizona,
where the boy is almost paralyzed with shyness at his new high
school. He tries to reach his East Coast buddies via ham radio.
Instead, he happens on a frequency that broadcasts to his fellow
students in Arizona.
   In an amazing and not altogether convincing transformation,
Slater assaults the air waves with demonic fever. He attacks
parents, school authorities, sexual and other inhibitions. For one
frenetic hour he becomes Hard Harry, the foul-mouthed liberator of
enslaved teen-agers, dispenser of heavy-metal rock and outrageous
opinions.
   Grownups in the peaceful suburb pay little heed until Harry
starts exposing a corrupt school administration. The ruthless
principal (Annie Ross) launches a drive to stamp out Harry. Failing
that, she enlists the help of the FCC, which dispatches a small
army to track down Harry's signal. By this time he has inflamed his
fellow students to the riot stage and has been located by a
beautiful classmate, Samantha Mathis, who supports his cause.
   Allan Moyle wrote and directed ``Pump Up the Volume,'' which
exploits the assets of youth films, which is mainly fresh faces and
vibrancy. He also succumbs to the liabilities, especially the
portrayal of adults as simpleminded clods or venal tyrants. A few
improbabilities remain, such as how Slater could hide his rantings
from his parents in the same house.
   Slater, who was Sean Connery's young companion in ``The Name of
the Rose,'' is electrifying as the manic Harry. He is one of the
best young actors around. Mathis as the would-be friend has real
presence, though she seems too mature for high school. Ellen Greene
is effective as a sympathetic teacher.
   The New Line release was produced by Rupert Harvey and Sandy
Stern. The rating is R for raw language. Running time: 100 minutes.

   The ``Big Easy'' credits rolled, the
lights came up and the class was full of questions. Was the movie
based on fact? Was Jim Garrison really responsible for cleaning up
Louisiana? How do you pronounce that strange name, Chopitoola? Is
Cajun music taught?
   As in most classes, a few people asked most of the questions and
the class clown made a crack or two. But there was a difference
between this class and others at the University of Southwestern
Louisiana: no college kids.
   The 22 students had come from around the country to Lafayette
for a weeklong ``Elderhostel,'' part of a national program for
people 60 or older.
   ``We must continue our education,'' 66-year-old Douglas Rowley
said, and winked.
   He and his wife, Lila, said they spent the past two winters in
Texas. They came through south Louisiana on their way home last
winter and wanted to see more of the area.
   They looked in Elderhostel Inc.'s fat tabloid catalog _
Elderhostels are given in every state and Canadian province and
numerous countries overseas _ and found the right combination of
time, place and subject in Lafayette.
   ``We've known about them for three or four years, but this was
the first time we were finally motivated enough to try one,'' said
Mrs. Rowley.
   The classes were an odd gumbo of topics: Cajuns and Creoles in
Louisiana films, Louisiana architecture, Mississippi River customs
and geology, and the Cajun waltz and two-step.
   That's often the case in elderhostels.
   You can go, for example, to Connecticut College in New London
and study psychological portraits of American presidents, Dante's
``Inferno'' and country dances of old England.
   Elderhostels try to schedule a variety of topics, preferably
divided among science and arts and humanities, said Cynthia Trahan,
administrative director for USL's program.
   There are some exceptions. The elderhostel timed to coincide
with the Festivals Acadiens focuses on Cajun food, Cajun music and
dancing, and Louisiana arts and crafts. The Mardi Gras elderhostel
describes the history of Carnival and its various traditions.
   Tuition at Louisiana elderhostels ranges from $210 to $265. The
classes bring instructors and the schools a little money, but not
riches, Trahan said.
   Many elderhostels put their students up in dormitories, but USL
uses part of the tuition to pay for rooms in a motel, shuttling
students back and forth in vans.
   John and Corabeth _ or Jack and Bess _ Fuller of Houston liked
that. ``I always look for two or less to a room and a private
bath,'' said Mrs. Fuller, 72. ``I look at the subject carefully,
but if you stay in cabins with six people to a room ...'' She shook
her head.
   Fuller, 69, said he was particularly interested in the daylong
tour of the Mississippi River and in the descriptions of Cajun life
and culture.
   They learned that Cajuns are the descendants of French Canadians
whom the British kicked out of what was called Acadia in 1755.
   They also learned that the movie ``Belizaire the Cajun'' is, as
teacher Mathe Allain put it, a fairy tale; that inaccuracies in
``Blaze'' include having someone as handsome as Paul Newman play
Gov. Earl K. Long; and that a pair of dams in central Louisiana is
all that keeps the Mississippi River from changing course and
leaving New Orleans on a mud flat.
   As for ``The Big Easy,'' Allain told the class its plot wasn't
based on any particular case; Garrison was a district attorney
rather than the judge he played in the movie and was known best for
his investigation of John F. Kennedy's assassination; and that
there aren't a lot of formal lessons in Cajun music.
   One detail tripped her up. She spelled Tchoupitoulas Street
correctly, but pronounced it ``ChoopiTOOla'' rather than the
``ChoppuhTOOlis'' heard in New Orleans.
   ``It does throw outsiders,'' she said.

<HEAD>Elderhostel Program Brings Parents, Grandparents Back to School</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON LESKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While most college students spend their time at school waiting
for summer breaks, some of their parents and grandparents are
spending vacations back in class.
   Elderhostel programs are patterned after European youth hostels,
in which travelers can live in groups, and are offered at more than
1,500 schools worldwide to people aged 60 and over.
   ``What elderhostel shows is that learning really doesn't ever
end,'' said William Washington, special programs director at
Cranbrook-Kingswood School in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
Cranbrook-Kingswood is one of 30 programs in Michigan.
   While some Michigan schools offer courses year-round, about 75
percent of the older students attend classes from June to August.
   ``People are living healthier, more active lives, and this is a
program that helps them do that,'' said Lynn Kindel, state director
at elderhostel's Central Michigan University headquarters.
   Cady Goldberg, public relations director for the elderhostel
national headquarters in Boston, said the program ``transcends the
stereotypical activities that have previously been assigned to the
retirement years, like bingo and bowling.''
   Kindel said there are no educational prerequisites. ``All you
need to be is interested and active.''
   The program started in 1975 under Marty Knowlton, a social
activist who once drove an ambulance in the French Foreign Legion,
and David Bianco, director of residential life at the University of
New Hampshire.
   Programs started on five New Hampshire campuses with 200
participants. By 1980, the program had reached all 50 states.
   About 220,000 people signed up for 1989-90 sessions worldwide,
Kindel said.
   Kindel said older students often are more challenging for
teachers than traditional college students.
   ``Elderhostelers are going to say, `We don't believe you,'
because they were around when history was being made,'' he said.

   Edna Green devoted her life to education,
retiring nine years ago as head of the science department at a
public high school for gifted girls.
   Today she is back in school, a student this time, under a
program at the University of Pennsylvania that permits retirees to
audit courses in exchange for volunteer work. They also are asked
to contribute $50 per semester to a scholarship fund.
   Retirees can audit anything from poetry to engineering courses.
They also can use the gymnasium and pool and receive other student
benefits, such as reduced theater rates.
   They volunteer as tutors, counselors, techincal assistants,
office and library assistants.
   Last semester, Green took courses in speech, sculpture and
poetry, and she's looking ahead to the fall schedule. She
volunteered at the campus information center.
   The 9-year-old Senior Associates Volunteering Valuable Years
program at Penn grew out of a trend that began in the 1970s, when
retired teachers sought ways to stay intellectually active without
the pressures and expenses of enrolling in degree programs.
   Other programs still going include ``Prime Timers,'' at
California State University, ``Learning in Retirement,'' at Duke
University in North Carolina, and the ``Senior Adult Program,'' at
Phoenix College in Arizona.
   The special slant at Penn is getting seniors involved in all
aspects of campus life, even as living textbooks for history
students, said Nancy Ellis, associate director for education at the
Center for the Study of Aging at Penn.
   As an American history requirement, for example, Bruce Kuklick
has students interview people who lived through the Great
Depression, World War II and the New Deal.
   The 200 senior associates for this year came from teaching,
engineering and business backgrounds. They range in age from 62 to
over 90, but the majority are in their 70s.
   The program began in 1981 when Norton Shapiro, a federal
government retiree who was auditing courses, suggested an
organization for retirees on campus, Ellis said.
   Until 1986, Shapiro chaired SAVVY's steering committee, which
meets monthly during the academic year to organize activities.
   Initially, the program was strictly academic, said Green, who
earned her master's degree in biology at Penn.
   ``The volunteer business didn't come until later when we thought
we ought to give something back to the university for what they
were giving us,'' she said.
   But, Ellis said, the seniors wanted to be real contributors.
   ``We do not want to stuff envelopes, we don't want to file in
somebody's back room, and we don't want to do menial tasks,'' Ellis
said. ``Also, we don't want to take projects away from the graduate
students. We're not interested in being free help at somebody
else's expense.''
   Green volunteered at the Funderburg Information Center three
days a week, providing campus information to students, tourists and
others. Volunteers are expected to work at least three hours a week.

<HEAD>Basic Needs Don't Change With Age, Author Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Self-defense against old-age stereotypes is the
main skill people require as they grow old in this country, and
those not yet retired must recognize a need to ``wholly abolish the
mischievous idea that after a fixed age we become different,
impaired or non-people,'' contends a new book.
   ``As an `old person' you will need four things _ dignity, money,
proper medical service and useful work,'' says author Alex Comfort.
   ``They are exactly the things you always needed. As things are
today, you won't get them, but there is no divinely ordered reason
why you should not. So either set out now to see that you do get
them or work to force society to change its posture _ or do both.''
   Comfort, born in 1920, originally published much of the book in
1976 under the title, ``A Good Age.'' The revised and updated
version, in paperback from Crown Publishers Inc., is called, ``Say
Yes to Old Age.''
   It details the stereotypes our society assigns to its older
members, suggests how to develop positive attitudes toward aging,
and details many notable people _ from actor George Burns to French
President Charles de Gaulle to architect Frank Lloyd Wright _ who
achieved great things in later life.
   ``What is unique in our culture is that older people are made
arbitrarily roleless,'' says Comfort. ``Some avoid this because
people are more sensible than society, but it is the accepted
pattern.''
   To change things, he suggests, it becomes necessary to lie down
on the tracks and say, ``Stop.''
   ``The new old will be more willing, I think, to do this than are
the now old; when the now old were young, even in the early days of
labor unions, protest was less an organ of orderly political change
than it is today.''
   By the year 2010, about 14 percent of the U.S. population is
expected to be 65 or older. ``Unless we are old already, the next
`old people' will be us,'' the book says. ``Whether we go along
with treatment now meted out to those who are now old depends upon
how far society can sell the bill of goods it sold them.''
   This treatment, it contends, relies on two principles: the
unpeople principle and the expendable people principle.
   ``When women were expected to faint at the sight of blood or
black people to be amiable Uncle Toms, some did and were; now that
those rules are seen to be demeaning or ridiculous, they don't and
aren't. ... The trouble with the part we assign to `the old' is
that it is the destructive part. They are supposed to be physically
and intellectually infirm, slow on the uptake and rigid in their
ways.''
   Aging, as a physical problem, is real but ``old age, as it is
now sold, is an imaginary state which need exist only as long as we
believe it does and impose it on people by all kinds of economic
and social pressures.''
   ``We can't take the pain out of the facts that humans aren't
immortal or indefinitely disease-proof, or that illnesses
accumulate as we age,'' Comfort says.
   On the other hand, he says at another point, ``you need not
count on illness or decrepitude. Your memory, sexuality, activity,
capacity for relationship and zest should normally last as long as
you do last in a majority of people.''
   Other sample comments:
   _ ``The chief reasonable fears are of ill health, of poverty, of
being the victim of attack or robbery, of falling and of becoming
ill while alone. Unreasonable fears (fears, that is, laid on us by
old-age role prescription) include fear of losing grip on memory,
of being a burden, of making demands and of `losing our dignity' by
insisting on public entitlements for which we have paid.''
   _ ``The word `senile' is less a diagnosis than a term of abuse.''
   _ ``There is no change in the ability of healthy people to learn
up to and beyond the ninth decade of life. ... Using the mind
preserves it.''
   _ ``The commonest cause of sexual nonfunction at all ages is
performance anxiety.''
   If the last sounds vaguely familiar, this is the same Alex
Comfort who wrote the best-seller, ``Joy of Sex,'' when today's
retirees were young.

<HEAD>Retired Women Earning Less than Retired Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retirement income for many older women is
falling significantly behind benefits received by older men,
according to a study and congressional testimony.
   By the year 2000, more than 62 percent of American women are
expected to be in the labor force. The percentage is expected to
rise throughout the 21st century.
   But as the number of women workers rises, so does poverty among
retirees, especially among retired women living alone, specialists
in the problem say.
   A study by the Older Women's League contends the problem lies
not with Social Security income but with private pensions.
   In 1970, according to the study, women received 70 percent of
the Social Security benefits received by men. By last year this had
increased to 73 percent.
   But the report says that while private pension income paid to
women in 1974 was 73 percent of that paid to men, by 1987 that had
fallen to 54 percent.
   The study said that nearly 75 percent of older Americans living
below the poverty line are women. Of all older women, 41 percent
live in near poverty, it said.
   Other findings:
   _ Almost four times more widows live in poverty than do wives of
the same age.
   _ Half the widows who are now poor did not live in poverty
before their husbands died.
   _ In 1988, almost half the women 65 or older were widows.
   Convening a recent hearing of the House subcommittee on
retirement income, Chairman William J. Hughes, D-N.J., said:
``Although our mothers, wives and daughters are spending more time
in the labor force, poverty among older women is projected to
continue to grow well into the next century.''
   Louise Crooks, immediate past president of the American
Association of Retired Persons, contended that women are at risk
``because they outlive their spouses, are more likely to live alone
and are more likely to have little or no private pension income and
a low-wage history.''
   Because women have tended to enter and leave the work force more
often than men, as a group they receive lower Social Security and
private pension benefits then men, other witnesses said.
   Ms. Crooks said that this is largely due to the responsibilities
of caring for children, most often assumed by women.
   Lou Glasse, president of the Older Woman's League, said the
Social Security system is best at accommodating the needs of
``families that consist of a lifelong breadwinner, a lifelong
homemaker, and children.''
   ``Less than 10 percent of American families fit that definition
today, and even fewer will fit this mold in the future,'' she said.
   But other witnesses said Social Security at least provides an
income floor for older women and that the real problem lies with
their eligibility for private pensions.
   Many women receive no pensions because they tend to work in the
service industry or for smaller firms that do not provide them.
   Hughes said that if an elderly couple is living on the husband's
pension and he dies first, the wife generally receives only a
fraction in survivor's benefits.

   Grace Jordan retired 33 years ago to a
riverside she named ``donrovin,'' but at 94 she acts more like the
title of her favorite soap opera _ ``The Young and the Restless.''
   Intellectually curious, unabashedly positive and suprisingly
spry, this tiny woman is a testament to the aphorism taped to her
kitchen wall: ``You can't help aging, but you don't have to grow
old.''
   Mrs. Jordan is believed to be the oldest graduate of Dale
Carnegie training, completing a 14-week course when she was 93. She
drove until she was 92. At 90, she was still taking aerobics
classes.
   Mrs. Jordan has been slowed recently by fading vision, but she
had no trouble climbing the steep slope leading to her pier that
juts into the clear water of the lower Corrotoman River.
   As a tender spring breeze caressed tendrils of silver hair
streaming below her straw hat, she sat at the end of the pier and
expounded on her philosophy of life.
   ``Joy in the heart, pleasure in the mind, a body free of pain.
If you have that you can be happy all day,'' she said.
   But one has to begin with an enthusiastic embrace of life.
   ``He who wakes at dawn with enthusiasm may expect satisfaction
at sunset,'' Mrs. Jordan said.
   ``Youth is enthusiastic and old age likes to sit. It's crazy to
do nothing. There's no enthusiasm in nursing homes. They're just
sitting around. Life is over. They're just waiting for the end.''
   ``Have something to look forward to,'' she advised. ``Before I
go to sleep at night I plan what I want to do the next day.
   ``You've got to keep the mind active and exercised.''
   Mrs. Jordan never went to college and quit high school after 2{
years, but she has taken correspondence courses in English grammar,
sewing, dress design, flower arranging, interior decorating,
landscaping, astrology and oil painting. Many of her paintings hang
in area restaurants.
   ``All my life I've been seeking truth,'' she said. ``I've read
every book I could get my hands on. If I can get one new idea out
of a book I consider it worth the price.''
   After leaving school at 16, the Richmond native went to work in
a dry goods store for $4 per week. She later learned bookkeeping
and in 1918 began a career in that field.
   Her lifelong love of learning was the reason she took the Dale
Carnegie course in Effective Speaking and Human Relations. ``I
might get something to think about,'' she said.
   As it turned out, she gave her 34 classmates something to think
about, said instructor Buck Stahl.
   ``A deep respect grew from all classmates for her,'' Stahl said.
``When she got up (to speak) you could hear a needle drop. People
didn't even squirm in their seats. She was an inspiration to all of
us.''
   Lillian Taylor, a spokeswoman for Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates
Inc. in New York, said Mrs. Jordan is believed to be the oldest
gradute of a Carnegie course. More than 3{ million people have
graduated from the personal development courses since 1912, she
said.
   In addition to intellectual exercise, Mrs. Jordan is an avid
believer in keeping the body active.
   She isn't participating in an organized exercise program at the
moment, but follows a home exercise routine.
   Loading a cassette into her tape player, she placed a
5-foot-long wooden rod over her shoulders and started waltzing,
slowly pulling the rod down her back. The exercise ``keeps the chin
out of the navel,'' said the 5-foot woman only slightly bowed by
her years.
   Her husband died in 1979 and she has no children, but Mrs.
Jordan said she doesn't get lonely.
   ``I would if it wasn't for the fact I've learned how to accept
what is. I'm interested in life and learning and getting ahead.''
   Another secret to her long and productive life, she said, is,
``I don't worry at all.''
   She said she learned long ago to turn problems and low periods
into growth experiences.
   ``After each problem worked itself out I had learned a lesson. I
was either a little bit stronger, a little bit wiser or had more
self-confidence.''

<HEAD>A Plant Will Let You Know What's Wrong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES E. WALTERS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ailing plants usually provide clues as to what's
wrong. Often, just asking why you're concerned points to the
solution. Sometimes a little luck helps, too.
   As an example of such luck: I wanted purple-flowering Texas sage
(Leucophyllum frutescens) for an informal, 6-foot hedge to hide a
cement-block wall. Six of seven took hold beautifully. The laggard
seemingly had an identical start and care. Naturally, it was the
middle one.
   I checked things like drainage, watering and insects and even
considered genetic differences. It turned out to be a live wire.
   Our gray kitten of that name was discovered rolling on the
center plant several times a day. A chicken-wire enclosure diverted
Wire to such fruitless pursuits as chasing hummingbirds until he
forgot about the bush. The hedge soon filled in.
   Fortunately, most plant problems fall into more routine
channels. But it's wise to never assume anything and to check
everything. Keep notes. Eliminate possible causes methodically.
   Bark splitting? Leaves yellowing? Is the entire plant affected
or just one side? Has the decline been sudden or over a period of
time? How does adjacent vegetation look? Are insects obvious? Is
just one plant in trouble, or do similar ones show the same
symptoms? Was it planted too deeply or shallowly?
   Asking such questions usually pinpoints the trouble or provides
sufficient information for someone more knowledgeable to suggest
the cure, even without seeing the plant.
   Start by making sure what concerns you isn't normal for a
certain time of year. Leaf drop in the fall is expected from
deciduous plants. It can be worrisome from evergreens anytime.
   However, evergreens routinely replace some leaves and many drop
lots of them at certain seasons. If the remaining leaves look OK,
the plant probably is healthy.
   If there is a persistent, premature leaf drop, check watering
practices first. A sprinkler system may produce a fine lawn but it
seldom supplies sufficient moisture for trees and shrubs.
   These days, with drought and water rationing, occasional deep
watering becomes even more important to avoid shallow roots and
declining tree and shrub vigor. But remember also that excess water
kills a plant as easily as extreme dryness.
   Wilting foliage can be an early symptom of either. Probe into a
few inches of the soil with a trowel, a soil augur, or try
inserting a long-blade screwdriver. This may supply the answer.
   If not, what's adjacent to the plant? An alley, swimming pool,
driveway, a patio, the neighbor's yard? What's happened recently? A
cement expansion that may have damaged roots or changed drainage?
Swimming pool overflowed? Lawn fertilized with possible excess
amounts? Chemical spills?
   Are underground animals a possibility? A neighbor's collection
of agaves was ruined by gophers who ate the succulent stems before
their tunnels were noticed.
   A general yellowing of all leaves can be caused by lack of
fertilizer, extreme sunlight or high temperatures. If only older
leaves are affected, it could be lack of nitrogen or potassium,
soil high in salts or poor soil aeration.
   Yellowing of youngest leaves suggests lack of iron or chemical
damage. Marginal burning usually is traced to salinity.
   Plants under stress seem to attract insect pests. Honeydew on
leaves indicates sucking insects. Large numbers of ants may be
another clue of their presence.
   Which side of the plant showed symptoms first and when? Have a
soil sterilant or vegetation-killing chemicals been used under or
around the plant within three or four years? Some persist in the
soil for years but are not picked up by a plant until roots grow
into the area.
   How long have you had the plant? Even with the best care and
most favorable growing conditions, many can't be expected to
survive more than a year or two.
   If the worst happens, and the plant dies, the roots and the soil
surrounding them may tell why. A bad odor often means the soil was
kept too wet. Limited root development may indicate the same.
   Make it a practice to water in the morning so foliage dries
before dark. Deeply and infrequently normally is best. In general,
moist conditions favor plant diseases.
   Among the easiest problems to solve are things like tiny red
flowers suddenly appearing on a rosebush that normally has large
yellow flowers. Or poor-quality lemons appearing on an orange tree.
   Trace the branch with the off-type fruit or blooms and usually
it will be growing from below the graft _ a noticeable bulge in the
main trunk around ground level.
   Such off-growth, called a ``sucker,'' must be removed. It comes
from the rootstock, which normally is much stronger than the top
growth. Unless pruned, the inferior but stronger suckers take over
the plant.

<HEAD>Non-Hospital Care on the Rise, Medicare Review Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Older Californians are spending less time
in hospitals and undergoing fewer major surgeries, according to a
Medicare review.
   Medicare patients 65 years and older are being moved out of
hospitals and into nursing homes and home health care settings
``earlier and more frequently,'' said Jo Ellen Ross, chief
executive officer of California Medical Review Inc., a non-profit
organization that contracts with the federal government to monitor
Medicare services.
   As a result, more federal resources should be spent on health
care outside hospitals, she said.
   The shift corresponds to a national trend toward lower
hospitalization rates among the elderly. But it can create
financial strain for the elderly, according to experts who note
that Medicare does not pay for much of the care provided in private
homes or elsewhere.
   About 3.2 million Californians over 65 receive Medicare
coverage, but many supplement the coverage by private insurance or
out-of-pocket payments.
   The number of California Medicare recipients admitted to
hospitals dropped about 45,000 from 1987 to 1989, although the
number of elderly people served by Medicare during that period
increased by nearly 110,000, according to the report, which was
issued last month.
   Surgery rates dropped nearly 11 percent in the 12 months after
doctors were required in April 1989 to get permission from CMRI
before performing a number of major surgical procedures, the report
said.
   The changes have saved taxpayers $114 million.
   Some physicians complain that they have to fend off pressures
from hospitals to discharge Medicare patients because hospitals are
paid a flat rate for certain types of care. But Ross said studies
show that rarely occurs.

<HEAD>Earnings Edge Up in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. said Monday its second-quarter
earnings rose 2.1 percent despite lower prices, mainly because of
growth in apparel and seasonal hardware sales.
   The nation's second-largest retailer said it earned $148
million, or 74 cents a share, during the 13 weeks ended Aug. 1,
compared with $145 million, or 72 cents a share, during the same
time last year.
   Revenue rose to $7.8 billion this year from $7 billion last year.
   ``The strength in apparel sales was particularly encouraging,''
said K mart Chairman Joseph Antonini.
   He said the corporation's profit margin was dented by K mart's
strategy of lowering shelf prices and including the lower-profit
margin PACE Membership Warehouse operation in the second-quarter
results.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, K mart's profit rose 3.8
percent to $248.1 million, or $1.24 a share, from $239.1 million,
or $1.19 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose to $14.8 billion from $13.1 billion last
year.
   K mart operates more than 4,000 retail stores in the United
States, Canada and Puerto Rico, including K mart discount stores,
Pay Less Drug Stores, Builders Square, Waldenbooks, PACE and The
Sports Authority outlets.,
   Antonini said he expected the corporation's specialty businesses
will add to K mart's profitability in the future despite a probable
economic slowdown and uncertainty in the Middle East.

<HEAD>OPEC Says Not Enough Support to Hold Emergency Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC said Monday there was not enough
support among its members to call an emergency meeting to consider
Saudi Arabia's request to boost oil production.
   A brief statement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries said its president, Algeria's Sadek Boussena, would meet
with some other oil ministers before the end of the month to
discuss the situation. It did not elaborate.
   Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Hisham Nazer, said Saturday his
country would boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels
a day with or without the support of OPEC.
   He had urged the cartel to hold a special session to try to take
measures to bring down oil prices, which have soared because of the
Middle East crisis.
   But the statement issued by OPEC's headquarters in Vienna said
that ``an extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference has not been
able to secure the necessary support'' of seven of the group's 13
members.
   ``An extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference will,
consequently, not be held,'' the statement said.
   But it said Boussena would meet with other ministers because of
the ``situation in the oil market and to reflect the organization's
serious concern.''
   Saudi Arabia's pledge to increase its production by as much as 2
million barrels a day would make up about half of the crude lost to
world markets because of the international embargo on oil shipments
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The kingdom, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, was pumping about
5.3 million barrels of oil a day at the end of July, according to
the International Energy Agency.

   The stock market headed higher today, bidding to
rebound from its slide of the past five weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 354.95 points
since it reached a record close of 2,999.75 on July 16, rose 16.09
to 2,660.89 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 513 up, 474 down and 457
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said stocks appeared to benefit from an easing of some
of the most extreme worries that had developed of late as a result
of the tensions in the Middle East.
   That helped encourage buyers to move in looking for ``bargains''
among recently depressed stocks.
   But brokers said serious misgivings persisted about prospects
for the U.S. economy after this summer's upsurge in the price of
oil and other forces set in motion by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Economists say the Federal Reserve has little room to maneuver
as it seeks to avoid a recession and at the same time minimize the
inflationary effects of the new oil shock.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines rose } to 102&lsqb;; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained &lsqb; to
33{; Boeing dropped \ to 48\, and General Electric was down &lsqb; at
63~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.79 to 180.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .37 at 333.24.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 36.64 to a
5{-month low of 2,644.80, bringing its loss for the week to 71.78

<HEAD>British Petroleum to Sell Netherlands Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum Co. PLC said Monday it will
auction off its gas exploration and production holding company in
the Netherlands.
   BP refused to disclose the estimated value of BP Exploratie BV,
a wholly owned subsidiary of British Petroleum Nederland.
   The unit holds stakes in 23 offshore blocks and two on shore.
And analysts said the offer would fetch between $60 million and $70
million.
   The fields produce 14 million standard cubic feet of natural gas
each day, said a British Petroleum spokesman, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The yield is 1.2 percent of British Petroleum's world production
and 2.1 percent of the firm's European production, the spokesman
said.
   The company added that the fields include two areas being
developed which could add a further 3 million standard cubic feet
to the unit's daily production.
   Bids have been invited from a small number of companies, which
BP declined to identify, the company said.
   John Browne, BP exploration chief executive officer, said the
proposed sale ``is in line with our recent review of worldwide
activities and future strategic direction'' which will focus on the
company's core producing assets and frontier exploration.

<HEAD>Harleysville Group to Acquire USLICO's Insurance Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARLEYSVILLE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pennsylvania insurance firm announced
plans Monday to buy the property and casualty insurance operations
of Arlington, Va.-based USLICO Corp. for $135 million in cash and
notes.
   Harleysville Group Inc. and its parent company, Harleysville
Mutual Insurance Co., said they had signed a letter of intent to
buy USLICO's Hawkeye-Security Insurance Co., based in Des Moines,
Iowa.
   The deal also includes Hawkeye-Security's subsidiaries, Des
Moines-based United Security Insurance Co. and Freeport, Ill.-based
Western States Insurance Co.
   USLICO would receive $93 million cash from Harleysville Group,
$17 million cash from Harleysville Mutual and $25 million in a
seven-year, 10 percent note from Harleysville Mutual.
Hawkeye-Security would return to USLICO 500,000 shares of USLICO
common stock just before closing Jan. 2.
   The deal, subject to approval by regulators and boards of
directors, would be effective Jan. 1.
   The companies to be acquired are represented by more than 1,000
independent agents in 15 midwestern and western states.
   ``This acquisition provides us with a tremendous opportunity to
achieve the strategic diversification we have sought since we began
pursuit of our strategic goal to build a `national network of
regional insurance companies' several years ago,'' Bradford W.
Mitchell, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of
Harleysville Group, said in a statement.
   The move would extend the company's territory to 34 states, he
said.
   In a separate announcement, Harleysville Mutual said it would
sell its subsidiary, Harlesville Life Insurance Co., to USLICO for
$17 million in a seven-year, 10 percent note.
   Harleysville Group is a holding company for four East Coast
property and casualty insurers, Atlantic Insurance Company of
Savannah, Harleysville Insurance Company of New Jersey, Huron
Insurance Co. and Worcester Insurance Co.
   Harleysville Group also manages the operations of Berkshire
Mututal Insurance Group, based in Pittsfield, Mass.
   Last month, Harleysville Group announced an agreement in
principle to acquire New York Casualty Insurance Co. and Phoenix
General Insurance Co. from Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co.
   Harleysville Group had net written premiums of $300.8 million in
1989 and assets of $568.5 million on Dec. 31.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hyatt Corp. announced Monday it is replacing
the 19-year-old logo for its hotels and resorts with an updated
symbol designed to project a more stylish image.
   The new rectangular-shaped logo features the word Hyatt, written
in stylized white letters on a deep blue backround. A slim red
crescent drawn through the letter ``A'' ``symbolizes the
sunrise-to-sunset experience of the Hyatt guest,'' Chicago-based
Hyatt said in a statement.
   A grey border beneath the main part of the logo features the
words ``Hotels &amp; Resorts'' in white block letters.
   The old logo, dubbed ``the bug'' by many employees, featured a
white and black four-leaf clover shape inside a circle and
contained no words identifying it with Hyatt.
   The new logo will be used for hotels and resorts affiliated with
Hyatt Hotels Corp., a subsidiary that operates facilities in the
United States, Canada and the Caribbean; and for those run
elsewhere in the world by sister subsidiary Hyatt International.
   ``We've already spent in excess of $1 million developing the new
logo _ and it has yet to appear on even one of our hotel cocktail
napkins,'' said Adam Aron, Hyatt Hotels' senior vice president for
marketing.
   The new logo will begin appearing next month in national and
international advertising. It will take between two to five years
to complete the changeover, said Aron. He said the total cost has
not been determined.
   Hyatt Hotels Corp. operates 91 hotels and 15 resorts in the
United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Hyatt International
operates 35 hotels and 19 resorts in 28 countries.

<TEXT>
   Unleaded gasoline hit record high prices on the
New York Mercantile Exchange this morning, and the price of crude
oil kept rising despite news that Saudi Arabia would increase
production.
   In early trading, September futures prices for unleaded gasoline
hovered around $1 a gallon, more than 4 cents higher than Friday's
record-high closing price of 95.97 cents per gallon.
   ``There's a lot of tension,'' said a vice president with Merrill
Lynch Energy Futures who did not want his name used. ``The
products, unleaded gasoline and heating oil, are on the way up.
They are moving up much faster than the price of crude.''
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, was up 32
cents to $28.95 per 42-gallon barrel for September delivery in
early trading today on the Merc, a leading world market for
petroleum products.
   Some traders had thought petroleum prices might drop today,
because Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer promised Saturday
to boost oil production by as much as 2 million barrels a day with
or without the support of OPEC. That would make up roughly half of
the 4 million barrels per day that are kept out of the world
markets by the embargo of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Prices opened a bit lower this morning on that news. But the
market soon turned around and prices moved higher, with the
exception of natural gas, which fell in early trading from $1.440
to $1.425 per 1,000 cubic feet on September futures.
   Wholesale heating oil was up 1.36 cents to 81.90 cents per
gallon for September delivery.
   ``Basically, what we're seeing here is very frenetic and choppy
trading,'' said Jerry Samuels, a vice president with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The Merrill Lynch vice president said the prices of refined
petroleum products were moving higher much faster than crude prices
because of fears of supply problems.
   For example, he said, no one knows what will become of Kuwaiti
facilities that supply refined products in Europe.
   Traders have also expressed concerns of supply problems in the
United States because three modern Kuwaiti refineries have been
taken out of the market by the embargo. Many of the world's
refineries that could boost output are not equipped to produce
petroleum products that meet U.S. requirements.

   Soybean futures were mostly lower and corn and
wheat futures were narrowly mixed in quiet dealings today on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   There were some concerns that heavy rains overnight in the
Midwest might have damaged corn and soybean plants, especially in
north-central Illinois, analysts said.
   But those fears were offset by perceptions that the rain helped
crops in other areas.
   ``Our weatherman says that overall the rain is more beneficial
than detrimental,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Trading in the corn and wheat pits was subdued as players
awaited fresh supply-and-demand developments and news about the
Middle East.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in September at $2.81{ a
bushel; corn futures were { cent lower to \ cent higher with
September at $2.51 a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower

   Cattle futures were lower while pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures dropped in a response to Friday's monthly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which showed far more
cattle placed on feedlots last month than the market had expected.
   Live cattle futures were .65 cent to 1.05 cents lower with
August at 77.25 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to .85

cent lower to .08 cent higher with August at 57.20 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .88 cent higher with August
at 49 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures fell on Friday; pork bellies were mixed.

<HEAD>GM Contract Proposal Due This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will present the United Auto
Workers union with a contract proposal this week, less than a month
before the UAW-GM labor contract expires, the company's chief
negotiator said today.
   Alfred Warren said he expects the company's proposal to cross
the main bargaining table late this week.
   Warren met with reporters this morning, shortly after UAW
President Owen Bieber told the media he had urged GM to come up
with a proposal soon.
   ``I had hoped that they would have had a proposal out by this
time,'' Bieber said. ``It hasn't been forthcoming. I expect we'll
see one in the next few days, (which) ought to be one that is not a
starter proposal.''
   The UAW has been bargaining with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. since July for three contracts covering more than 450,000
workers. For the first time in 11 years, the Big Three contracts
expire at the same moment _ on Sept. 14.
   Bieber said the union would choose its target company for
bargaining within 10 days. The union has high-level meetings set
for Aug. 27-28, and it's likely the target will be chosen at that
time.
   Analysts expect GM will be chosen. Traditionally, the agreement
reached with the target company forms a pattern for contracts at
the other two of the Big Three.
   One reason the scale has tipped towaished in 1928, is the largest at
a
private university in the West. The grant, announced Aug. 14, will
help it keep pace with rapid technological changes, said its
director, William J. Woestendiek.
   ``The instruction USC students receive in this state-of-the-art
newsroom working environment will greatly enhance their preparation
for a wide variety of professional positions in journalism,'' USC
President James Zumberge said.

   The Rocky Mountain News said Aug. 15 it will spend
$100 million over the next three years to more than double the size

color reproduction.
   The new, eight-unit Goss Colorliner presses will allow the News

   Strutton said the first press will arrive at the News plant in a

new press will be added every six weeks.
   The new presses will be fully computerized and have no manual

Strutton.

<HEAD>Government Recommends Against Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANTECA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Justice Department official is
recommending against the proposed merger of the daily Manteca
Bulletin and semiweekly Manteca News.
   ``We almost feel like we're being picked on because we're
smaller,'' Darell Phillips, director of California newspaper
operations for Morris Newspaper Corp., said Aug. 13. Morris owns
the Bulletin.
   The Justice Department's antitrust division found that poor
management caused a $4.7 million loss by the News since it began
publishing in 1977, said James Rill, assistant attorney general.
The division also decided that owners of the News did not try to
make a profit or sell the newspaper, he added.
   ``I conclude that the applicants have not carried their burden
of showing that no other management efforts would be likely to
succeed in reversing the News' losses,'' Rill said.
   Thus, he found that the News is not a failing newspaper under
the law.
   The Bulletin has a daily circulation of 6,000 in Manteca, a San
Joaquin Valley city 70 miles southeast of San Francisco. The News
is distributed free to about 19,000 households on Wednesdays and
has a paid circulation of about 2,400 for its Friday edition.

<HEAD>Number of Working Rigs Declines by Five</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and natural gas rigs in
the United States dipped by five this week to 987, according to a
widely-watched index of drilling activity released Monday.
   Baker Highes Inc, an oil toolmaker, said its count had climbed
by 26 to 992 a week ago. In the two previous weeks before that
increase, the count had dropped by a combined 56 rigs. A year ago
this week, the count was 903.
   The Houston-based company has kept track of the rig count since
1940. The count represents the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil, not those producing oil.
   Ike Kerridge, a vice president at Baker Hughes, said Monday he
was not sure why the count dropped slightly this week. But he added
he expected the count to increase if the Middle East crisis
continues to push oil prices higher.
   ``There is a time lag. Price changes are not immediately
reflected'' in the rig count,'' Kerridge said.
   Oil is just one half of the rig count, he noted. The other
factor is natural gas, ``and those prices are still depressed.''
   ``If oil prices are looking like they're going to stay higher,
there probably will be an increase soon,'' he said. ``If I had to
guess, I'd say two to four weeks.''
   At the height of the oil boom in December 1981, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But the rig count plunged to a low of 663
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas gained seven rigs.
Michigan, Louisiana, Kansas and Pennsylvania each gained two more
rigs.
   States reporting declines for the week include New Mexico, down
eight; Colorado, down five; Oklahoma, down four; and Ohio, down
three. North Dakota and Wyoming each lost one rig.

   US Sprint said Monday it is reorganizing

attract greater numbers of small customers and improve service to
larger ones.
   The company's national markets division will switch from five
service groups to two, one focusing on customers with more than

business customers.
   Sprint, the nation's third largest long distance company,
announced a 55 percent drop in second quarter earnings a month ago.
It said at the time it would eliminate 1,000 jobs nationwide and
switch more employees to sales and service jobs.
   Sprint said about 500 administrative jobs would be trimmed from
its national markets division because of the changes there.
   The two divisions will ensure that larger customers receive the
more sophisticated products they want while smaller customers
receive a level of sales and service that was only available to
larger customers before, said Richard C. Smith, president of
national markets.
   Sprint, based in Kansas City, is owned 80 percent by United

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today against most major
foreign currencies but lost ground against the Japanese yen and
Canadian dollar in volatile trading in Europe. Gold prices also
rose.
   Traders said the currency markets have concerns about
sluggishness in the U.S. economy but are focused on developments in
the Middle East. They said signs of increasing trouble will boost
the dollar.
   ``But I think it's still fairly clear that the trend is for a
lower dollar,'' said one trader. ``We're in a stabilization phase
right now, which is actually quite healthy for the market.''
   Dealers added that the dollar found some further support from
concerns about Iraq's intentions surrounding Western nationals in
Kuwait. The Iraqi government over the weekend said it intended to
hold U.S. and other nationals whose nations were supporting
economic sanctions against Baghdad.
   The yen is gaining against the dollar, dealers said, because it
initially fell following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   It was thought that Japan's economy would be hardest hit by the
prospects of soaring oil prices, but the thinking has changed,
traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 147.47 Japanese yen from
147.35 yen at Friday's close. Later in London, it fell to 146.90
yen. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 146.70 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.9185 from $1.9195 late
Friday. In New York, the pound was quaoted at $1.91625 at midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.5625 German marks, up from 1.5485; 1.2940 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2815; 5.2375 French francs, up from 5.2045;
1.7585 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7445; 1,151.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,141.75, and 1.1437 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1440.
   Selected midday prices in New York included: 1.5630 German

<TEXT>
   Cash-strapped consumers will soon have access to
about twice as many automated teller machines.
   Plus System Inc. and Cirrus System Inc., the nation's largest
networks of ATMs, announced a formal agreement Monday to share
their machines.
   ``Plus and Cirrus are no longer competing for ATM locations,''
D. Daniel Browning, president of Plus System Inc., said in a
statement. ``Competition in the future will be based on the value
and service we provide.''
   Those who hold cards that work in either system should be able
to get cash from about twice as many machines as they do now within
1{ years, according to Plus.
   About three-quarters of the nation's ATMs belong to either Plus
or Cirrus networks. The systems have up to 55,000 ATMs combined in
locations such as airports, shopping centers and financial
institutions.
   Banks, though, will continue to be restricted from issuing cards
for both networks, Plus said.
   ``With today's agreement, Plus and Cirrus have virtually
eliminated the concern people have about running out of cash while
away from home,'' Browning said.

   Cockroaches might prefer to starve
to death than scurry anywhere near powerful repellents that
researchers hope can be used to build roach-proof homes and
businesses.
   Richard Brenner has spent six years creating a deterrent to
cockroaches as an entomologist for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Gainesville, Fla., research lab.
   He has worked with Air Vent Inc. of Peoria Heights to develop
the repellents and a deadly new bait that someday might provide
owners of infested homes and businesses a lethal one-two punch for
controlling the pesky insect.
   ``There's no silver bullet to do the job of cockroach
eradication,'' Brenner said. ``No single solution will ever solve
cockroach problems.
   ``But we're coming up with some things that will prevent
infestation and eliminate the growing number of health problems
we've linked to cockroaches.''
   The products resulted from a two-year research project funded by
Air Vent.
   Mike Daniels, national sales manager for Air Vent, envisions
putting the repellent in insulation and other construction
materials.
   And Air Vent is ready to market the bait as part of a new attic
ventilation system, designed with Brenner's help, that is designed
to drive roaches out of attics.
   Brenner's research has determined that cockroaches often enter a
home through roof vents and small openings. The insects prefer
warm, moist, dark environments to breed and find attics ideal
because of the static air.
   Other ideas for the repellents include using them on cardboard
boxes that carry food and attract roaches when they sit in
warehouses and storerooms.
   The repellents are five years from receiving EPA approval for
sale to the public, Brenner said. But the attic ventilation system
and bait could reach the marketplace within a year, he said.
   The investment may be worth the wait. Brenner estimates that
$1.5 billion is spent each year on pesticides to kill cockroaches.
   Another benefit of the research was Brenner's discovery that
cockroaches are responsible for serious allergy problems.
   His study found cockroaches produce allergens that affect an
estimated 10 million to 14 million people. He said the cockroach
allergens are the second most common allergy causer among
asthmatics.
   ``We need to design more insect-resistent structures and
eliminate infestation by cockroaches,'' Brenner said. ``That's why
we're excited about these products. We are making some progress.''

<HEAD>Arco Keeps Gasoline Freeze, Hikes Diesel and Jet Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Monday it will
keep a 12-day freeze on gasoline but raise prices for diesel and
jet fuel.
   Arco had heeded a call 12 days ago for oil companies to control
prices during the Middle East crisis. The company had included
diesel and jet fuel in the freeze announced Aug. 8.
   But George H. Babikian, president of Arco Products Co., a
marketing and refining division, said Arco ``cannot continue the
freeze on diesel and jet fuel prices in the face of sharp
differences in marketplace prices between Arco and its
competitors.''
   Arco has also been forced to augment jet fuel supplies with
purchases on the spot market at high prices, Babikian said in a
statement.
   Babikian said the gasoline freeze was being reviewed daily. The
company said it was encouraging dealers to ``show restraint in
setting prices'' and urged drivers to reduce use of gasoline during
the crisis.
   President Bush on Aug. 8 asked oil companies to do what they
could to hold down gasoline prices following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Arco receives most of its crude oil from Alaska and not the
Middle East.

   Soybean and wheat futures prices closed modestly
lower Monday while corn ended mixed in a quiet session on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Rainy weather in the Midwest weighed on the soybean market and
limited gains in corn, analysts said.
   ``All in all, it was a dull, nondescript day,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Soybeans traded in a narrow range, from $6.24 to $6.34 a bushel
for the contract for November delivery.
   Lespinasse said the lower $6.30 range has been established as an
area of considerable resistance for soybeans. When market bulls
were unable to rally the November contract beyond $6.34, many
turned sellers and pushed the market back down.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 1\ cents lower with
the contract for September delivery at $2.81 a bushel; corn was {

<HEAD>Forecast Says Construction Will Fall 7 Percent In 1990</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Construction contracts will decline 7 percent
this year as the nation struggles to pull out of a continuing
building slump, according to a private forecast issued Monday.
   Contracts in 1990 are expected to total $247.07 billion,
compared with $266.96 billion last year, McGraw-Hill Information
Services Co. said.
   In its latest Dodge-Sweet's Construction Outlook, McGraw-Hill
predicted housing starts would tumble 11 percent to 1.38 million
units this year, with most of the drop from the apartment and
condominium sector.
   The contract value of housing construction is expected to fall 7
percent, McGraw-Hill said.
   Commercial and manufacturing building is expected to drop 16
percent this year, hurt largely by big decrease in office
buildings, McGraw-Hill said. Institutional building, which includes
schools and hospitals, should decline 3 percent, it said.
   The total value of non-residential buildings is expected to slip
10 percent, according to the forecast.
   Meanwhile, the total value of public works construction is
expected to decline 1 percent, McGraw-Hill said.
   But George A. Christie, McGraw-Hill's chief economist, said the
worst appears to be over for the nation's building market.
   ``Every decline has its limit,'' he said.

<HEAD>Say Russian Republic Wants to Join OPEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russia's foreign economics minister said Monday
the Soviet Union's largest republic would like to join OPEC.
   Viktor Yaroshenko told a news conference that the republic
considered itself free to join such organizations because of its
assertion of independence of central Soviet control. The republic's
parliament has decided that it _ and not Soviet authorities _
control the resources on Russia's territory.
   ``We are prepared to enter as one of the members of OPEC, now
perhaps as an observer but in the future, if we are accepted, to
enter fully,'' Yaroshenko told reporters gathered in Russia's
Supreme Soviet chambers.
   It wasn't clear how the 13-member Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries would respond to an application, if it received
one. The cartel produces a substantial portion of the West's energy
needs.
   The Russian government is now headed by Ivan Silayev, a
reform-minded leader who works closely with Boris N. Yeltsin, the
republic's president.
   They are trying to generate foreign currency to help solve dire
economic problems, and the republic's oil is one potential revenue
source.
   Most of the Soviet Union's oil is located in Russia. The country
as a whole produces about 12.1 million barrels daily, making it one
of the world's leading producers. But much of that oil is consumed
domestically.

   General Motors Corp. said Monday it will give the
United Auto Workers union a contract offer later this week designed
to make the union pick the automaker as the target company for
nationwide negotiations.
   GM Vice President Alfred Warren, the company's chief labor
negotiator, disclosed its intentions in his first meeting with the
press since the opening of union talks on July 18. He didn't
specify a day or give further details about what the No. 1
automaker would offer.
   ``We would always rather lead than follow,'' he said. ``It seems
only appropriate that we would go first.''
   Contracts covering more than 450,000 workers at GM, Ford Motor
Co. and Chrysler Corp. expire Sept. 14, contributing to a growing
sense of urgency in an industry that has been troubled by a slow
economy and foreign competition.
   On Aug. 28, after a UAW leadership conference in Detroit, the
union is expected to choose one of the three automakers as a target
for further negotiations.
   Historically, an agreement reached with the target company
becomes a pattern for the other automakers. Each company prefers to
be the union's target because it provides the opportunity to
bargain a contract with more flexibility toward that company's
needs.
   Shortly after talks opened between the union and each of the Big
Three, negotiators broke into subcommittees to address specific
contract issues, such as job security, health care costs and time
off.
   Warren said work in those subcommittees has helped form the
company's proposal. But another aspect in formulating the proposal
was the company's desire to be the target company, he said.
   Meanwhile, UAW President Owen Bieber goes to the main bargaining
tables at Ford on Wednesday and Chrysler on Thursday. He was at GM
on Monday to remind bargainers that 25 days remain before the
current contracts expire.
   ``I had hoped that they would have had a proposal out by this
time,'' he said. ``It hasn't been forthcoming. I expect we'll see
one in the next few days, (which) ought to be one that is not a
starter proposal.''
   Warren said Monday he would fulfill that wish late this week. A
spokesman for Ford who declined to be identified said his company's
initial proposal was due Thursday. Chrysler spokesman Lee Sechler
said he knew of no timetable for such a proposal.

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. will create a new technology
center under a $540 million expansion project expected to create
1,000 new jobs, officials announced Monday.
   The pharmaceutical manufacturer will build several new buildings
at its Lilly Industrial Center in Indianapolis. The company's 3,000
employees there are expected to increase to 4,000 by the turn of
the century, according to a Lilly statement.
   Most of the new jobs will be high-paying professional research
and development positions, the company said in a statement.
   The project is expected to create 800 construction jobs as well,
said Lilly spokesman Edward A. West.
   Under the project's first phase, a $120 million biotechnology
development center will be built, to employ 100 scientists and
engineers. Another $235 million will be spent on additional
projects and on-site improvement.
   Lilly will fund the major expansion through its continuing
strong sales and profits. In fiscal year 1989, the company reported
record net sales of $4.1 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 1988.
Profits for the year totalled $939 million, up from $761 million a
year earlier.

<HEAD>United Artists Signs $2.8 Billion Financing Agreement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Artists Entertainment Co. has signed a $2.8
billion agreement that refinances the company's existing debt,
company officials announced Monday.
   The transaction also will enhance the company's ability to
replace short-term floating funds with long-term fixed rate funds,
and will provide funding availability to pursue future
opportunities, the company said in a news release.
   ``The refinancing was successful due to the breadth, depth and
quality of the company's lending relationships,'' said Brendan
Clouston, UAE executive vice president and chief financial officer.
   Company executives would not release financial details, but said
they believed the terms on the debt were attractive and appropriate
given the strength of the credit. The agreement does not represent
any material increase in borrowing costs, they said.
   Eight institutions led the various financings, but about 100
banks and institutions comprise the financing syndicate, UAE said.
   The refinancing has been planned since the firm acquired United
Cable in May 1989 in order to create a flexible long-term capital
structure for UAE, Clouston said.
   UAE owns or manages 86 cable television systems serving about
2.7 million subscribers, as well as 2,660 motion picture screens in
609 locations.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher, Gold Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed mostly higher against the
world's major currencies in moderate trading Monday, recovering
ground after many days of decline.
   Gold prices also rose. On the New York Commodity Exchange, an
ounce of gold closed at $410.10, up 50 cents from Friday. Later,
Republic National Bank quoted an after-hours bid of $409.25, up 75
cents, as of 4 p.m. EDT.
   Traders said much of the dollar's advance was due to investors
selling positions they held in other currencies in exchange for the
U.S. currency in order to take a profit.
   ``The market was stretched to the point of a need for a
correction,'' said Lorenzo Troni, vice president of foreign
exchange at PaineWebber International in New York. ``There is
always a point of profit-taking.''
   The dollar also was boosted by President Bush's strong
statements to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein about the fate of
foreigners held in Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``People are a little bit concerned we could be approaching a
flashpoint in this issue,'' said John McCarthy, chief dealer at
Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. The dollar typically is
viewed as a safe haven in times of international turmoil.
   Another factor boosting the dollar was a slight weakness in the
German mark due to trouble in the Social Democratic coalition
government in East Germany, McCarthy said.
   ``It demonstrate that things are not completely in order
there,'' he said.
   But McCarthy didn't expect the dollar's rebound to last. He said
the currency remains weak against other major currencies due to
rising interest rates abroad, which tend to support those foreign
currencies, and sluggishness in the U.S. economy.
   The dollar closed at 1.5641 marks in New York, up from Friday's
close of 1.5500 marks. Friday's close was an all-time low for the
dollar against the Germany currency. Earlier, in Europe, the dollar
closed at 1.5625 marks, up from 1.5485 Friday.
   The dollar also strengthened against the British pound. One
pound cost $1.9135 in New York, cheaper than $1.9230 late Friday.
In London, the pound fell to $1.9185 from $1.9195 late Friday.
   But the dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen. Troni said
the yen was boosted by weekend reports that Iran would supply oil
to Japan, whose economy is almost entirely dependent on imported
oil.
   In New York, the dollar bought 146.51 yen, down from 147.60 yen
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar had risen to a closing 147.47 yen
from 147.35 yen Friday. But in London, it fell to 146.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates as of 4 p.m. EDT in New York, compared with
late rates Friday, included: 1.2955 Swiss francs, up from 1.2820;
5.2565 French francs, up from 5.1975; 1,157.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,142.25; and 1.1427 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14365.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.2940 Swiss francs, up from 1.2815; 5.2375
French francs, up from 5.2045; 1.7585 Dutch guilders, up from
1.7445; 1,151.00 Italian lire, up from 1,141.75, and 1.1437
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1440.
   Gold rose in London to $409.75 a troy ounce from $409.25 late
Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid of $409.75 an ounce
from $408.25 late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 11 cents
an ounce to $409.77.
   Silver bullion in New York cost $5.129 a troy ounce on the
Comex, down from $5.179 late Friday. In London, silver fell to
$5.14 a troy ounce from $5.20 late Friday.

<HEAD>Interco Announces Details of Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interco Inc., a footwear and furniture maker,
will ask its bondholders to exchange their bonds for 95 percent of
the company's common stock and other consideration under a
complicated restructuring plan announced Monday.
   The plan is designed to restructure the $1.9 billion debt that
has plagued the St. Louis-based company for the past two years.
   It calls for the company to undertake a 23.5-for-1 reverse stock
split of Interco's roughly 38.7 million shares of common stock,
issue 98 million new shares of stock and take on $202 million in
new debt.
   Interco's stock closed at 31\ cents a share in consolidated
trading Monday, down 12{ cents from Friday.
   Most of the new shares and the new debt, along with warrants to
buy additional stock, will go to bondholders in exchange for about
$900 million in current debt.
   Some of the new shares of stock will go to preferred
stockholders, who will be asked to convert their preferred stock to
common stock under the plan, which must be approved by the
company's creditors.
   The company reached a basic agreement with representatives of
its creditor groups three weeks ago after a weekend of marathon
negotiations in New York. That agreement led to Monday's plan.
   Interco has been struggling to pay off its large junk-bond debt
since it borrowed $1.65 billion in 1988 to fend off a hostile
takeover attempt by corporate raiders Steven and Michael Rales.
   At the time, the company made men's and women's apparel,
operated 201 retail stores such as do-it-yourself hardware stores
and discount clothing stores, and owned footwear and furniture
stores.
   To pay off its debt, the company announced plans to sell off all
of its companies except the four it currently operates: Converse
and Florsheim footwear manufacturers along with furniture makers
Lane Co. and Broyhill Industries.
   That plan faltered when the subsidiaries were sold for far less
than what the company anticipated. That, coupled with the collapse
of the junk-bond market, left Interco with more debt than it
started with.
   ``The changes contemplated by the agreement in principle will
resolve that burdensome situation by restructuring Interco's
balance sheet,'' said Richard B. Loynd, chairman and chief
executive officer.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Crash to 8-Month Low on Brazil Price Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices settled at their lowest levels in
nearly eight months Monday after two Brazilian processors cut their
prices for the first time since a Christmas-time freeze shriveled
the Florida orange crop.
   On other commodity markets, petroleum futures were mostly
higher; precious metals were mixed; livestock and meat futures were
mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Wholesale frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 1.95
cents to the permitted daily limit of 5 cents lower on the New York
Cotton Exchange with the contract for delivery in September down
1.95 cents at $1.687 a pound, the lowest settlement of a near-month
contract since Dec. 29.
   Monday's decline followed a plunge of 9.95 cents in the
September contract on Friday amid rumors that the large Brazilian
juice processor Cutrala S.A. had slashed its preferred-customer
price more than 20 percent to $1.813 from $2.078 a pound.
   Cutrala confirmed the price cut on Monday. Another Brazilian
processor, Citro Sucro S.A., said it had cut its prices by the same
amount.
   The reductions were the first by the Brazilians since a freeze
last winter destroyed about 30 percent of the Florida orange crop.
The freeze drove prices up sharply and forced U.S. beverage
companies to rely on Brazil for about half of their orange juice
needs.
   The price cut was a surprise, said analyst Judith Ganes of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   ``It was generally expected by most industry sources that Brazil
would keep prices steadfast for at least another month or two,
until after first Florida crop estimate,'' she said.
   Analysts said the Brazilians apparently reduced their prices in
hopes of stimulating sales following industry reports of slumping
orange juice consumption.
   There was no sign that Florida processors intend to follow suit.
Esther Eskansy, a trader with Cargill Investor Services Inc., said
Florida processors' prices already were below the Brazilians' and
were now close to the new Brazilian levels.
   Ms. Ganes said that even if retailers decided to pass the
savings along, it could be two to three months before consumers see
a reduction in orange juice prices.
   Petroleum futures continued to rise on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as Persian Gulf tensions escalated, fueling speculation
that Middle East oil shipments to the United States will remain
restricted.
   In the gulf, Iraq announced it had carried out a plan to move
Western hostages to vital military installations to deter any U.S.
attack and warned its people not to try to hide any of the
thousands of foreigners trapped in the country.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents lower to 63
cents higher with September at $28.56 a barrel; heating oil was
2.42 cents to 4 cents higher with September at 82.96 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.85 cents to 4.28 cents higher with
September at $1.0025 a gallon.
   Cattle futures prices fell on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
as expected, after the Agriculture Department on Friday reported a
larger-than-expected number of cattle were placed on feedlots in
July.
   Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Co., said losses
in the near-term contracts were limited by perceptions that fed
cattle supplies will be relatively tight before the animals placed
on feed in July begin to reach the market in November.
   Pork futures advanced, led by sharp gains in the belly market.
   Live cattle settled .03 cent to .60 cent lower with October at
77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent lower to .02 cent
higher with August at 89.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
to .65 cent higher with October at 50.07 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.6 cents to 2 cents higher with August at 49.72 cents
a pound.
   Soybean and wheat futures prices closed modestly lower Monday
while corn ended mixed in a quiet session on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with September at
$2.81\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to 2{ cents higher with
September at $2.52\ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to { cent
higher with September at $1.16\ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents
lower to 1\ cents higher with August at $6.10} a bushel.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures ended 50 cents to
$1.10 higher with August at $410.10 a troy ounce; silver futures
were 5 cents lower across the board with September at $5.145 a troy
ounce.

   Wholesale unleaded gasoline prices surged over
the $1 mark for the first time Monday, boosted by what traders
called a growing belief the Middle East crisis will persist and
create a long-lasting tightness in supply.
   Anxiety over supplies also pushed prices up at the pump. The
American Automobile Association said its nationwide check of
unleaded self-serve regular averaged $1.237 a gallon Monday, up 2.1
cents from a week earlier. The average is 16.2 cents higher since
the crisis erupted Aug. 2, AAA said.
   The volatility that has beset oil trading over Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait compelled the New York Mercantile Exchange to temporarily
amend its rules Monday to allow bigger daily price swings on
oil-futures contracts.
   The Merc is one of the world's leading markets for oil and
gasoline products and is an important pacesetter for prices at the
retail level.
   Unleaded gasoline for September delivery reached $1.015 per
gallon at one point during the Merc's trading day Monday, the first
time that's ever happened. The price later settled for the day at a
record close of $1.003 per gallon, an increase of 4.28 cents over
Friday's closing price.
   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, dipped 7
cents per barrel to $28.56 for September delivery. But prices for
later months were all up, some by more than 50 cents a barrel.
   ``More players think the crisis is going to last longer,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   The market was responding partly to President Bush's declaration
that Americans held in Iraq and Kuwait are ``hostages'' and that
the United States holds Iraq responsible, she said.
   Some traders had predicted oil prices would drop Monday on the
news that Saudi Arabia promised over the weekend to boost
production by up to 2 million barrels per day. That would make up
roughly half of the shortfall caused by the international boycott
of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Hittle said the markets might not respond to any increase in
Saudi production until they see more than verbal assurances. She
said the September contract price of crude oil might have been the
only month to fall because traders were already starting to
concentrate on prices for October futures, with just one more day
of trading to go on the September futures contract.
   Unleaded gasoline and home heating oil contracts rose quickly
because of concerns about shortfalls, said a Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures vice president who did not want his name used.
   ``There's a lot of tension,'' he said. ``The products, unleaded
gasoline and heating oil, are on the way up. They are moving up
much faster than the price of crude.''
   Home heating oil for September delivery closed at 82.96 cents
per gallon, up 2.42 cents from Friday's close. The price of natural
gas stayed sluggish Monday, falling from $1.440 to $1.417 per 1,000
cubic feet for September delivery.
   The rules change at the Merc will be in effect for the next 30
days and could only become permanent following another vote by the
board and notification of federal regulators, a Merc spokeswoman
said.
   There are no limits to the movements in spot prices, or the
prices for petroleum products to be delivered in the next month.
But limits are imposed on the upward or downward movements on
futures prices for subsequent months.
   Under the temporary rules, the limits will be expanded by up to
$1 for crude futures and 2 cents for gasoline and home heating oil
futures.
   The limits are designed to give investors an idea of their
potential losses when each trading day begins, offering them a
degree of protection from rapidly moving markets.

   OPEC said Monday it will not hold an
emergency session to consider increasing oil production to help
make up for the shortage caused by the Mideast crisis.
   But analysts predicted Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil
exporter, would fulfill its pledge to boost output by as much as 2
million barrels a day to try to steady nervous oil markets.
   ``It is beyond assumption. ... The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
going to increase production,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the
international energy department at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in
London.
   ``Saudi Arabia probably would have preferred to do it with
OPEC's authorization. (But) they'll do it,'' agreed Peter Bogin,
associate director for oil markets at Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Paris.
   Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez said Monday
that several OPEC nations with the capacity to increase oil
production expect to meet within days, despite the OPEC
announcement.
   Perez, who had previously offered to increase oil output by
500,000 barrels daily if OPEC agreed, said his country would
produce more oil without an OPEC meeting.
   Monday's news was greeted with generally higher prices on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The September contract for West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. grade of crude, was down 7 cents
to $28.56 per 42-gallon barrel. But later contract months settled
higher.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC surged
last week to $25.29 a barrel, surpassing the cartel's newly set
target of $21.
   Analysts say about 4 million barrels a day have been pulled off
the market because of the international embargo on Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil shipments imposed after Iraq invaded its tiny neighbor.
   Iraq produced about 3.1 million barrels a day in late July,
while Kuwait produced 1.6 million barrels, according to the
International Energy Agency, an arm of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer said Saturday that his
country intended to increase oil production with or without
approval from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He
had urged the 13-nation cartel to hold an urgent meeting to discuss
the situation.
   But a brief statement issued by OPEC headquarters in Vienna said
a majority of members did not endorse the call.
   ``Since the proposal of Saudi Arabia to hold such a conference
has not been able to secure the necessary support, ... an
extraordinary meeting of the OPEC conference will, consequently,
not be held,'' said the statement carried by OPECNA, the group's
news agency.
   It said OPEC President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oil
minister, would meet with some other ministers before the end of
the month because of the ``situation in the oil market and to
reflect the organization's serious concern.'' It gave no details.
   The Algerian news agency APS quoted an unidentified source close
to Boussena as saying that three nations had joined Saudi Arabia
and Venezuela in supporting a special meeting. It did not name the
countries.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh was quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency as saying he opposed an
immediate meeting because there was enough oil in storage in the
industrialized world to make up for the loss.
   Saudi Arabia, which pumps about a quarter of the cartel's oil,
has an OPEC quota of just under 5.4 million barrels a day.
   While its production could be boosted by as much as 2 million
barrels more a day, analysts predicted Venezuela could produce
about 500,000 more barrels above its current level of 2 million
barrels to help fill the oil gap. Nigeria could add a few hundred
thousand barrels to its OPEC quota of 1.6 million barrels, analysts
said.
   The United Arab Emirates also has the capacity to lift
production from its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day to 2 million
barrels or more. But Bogin predicted it might be reluctant to do so.
   The U.A.E., like Kuwait, was criticized earlier this year by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for producing more than its OPEC
quota and helping drive down oil prices. He claimed lower prices
cost Iraq $14 billion in oil revenues in the past year.
   Late last month in Geneva, OPEC ministers agreed to limit
production to 22.5 million barrels a day to try to push crude
prices up to the new benchmark of $21 a barrel by year's end.

   The dollar opened sharply lower against the
Japanese yen Tuesday morning in Tokyo as share prices quickly
rebounded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar opened at 146.30 yen, down 1.17 yen from Monday's
147.47-yen close.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 585.49 points, or 2.24
percent, to 26,775.96 in the first 30 minutes of early trading. The
index declined 296.25 points Monday, closing at 26,490.47.
   The currency's decline in early Tokyo trading followed a similar
downswing in New York. The dollar's drop was mainly due to active
sales of the German mark against the yen, said a Bank of Tokyo
dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But the dollar slowed its decline near the 146-yen level because
some investors who were reaping profits had bought at that level,
dealers said.
   Weakness in the German mark resulted from the collapse of the
Social Democratic coalition government in East Germany, dealers
said. The dollar was stronger against other major currencies in New
York.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 146.51 yen on Monday, down
from 147.60 yen late Friday.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's early strength to active buying
by investors who had been encouraged by recovery of the yen against
the dollar and by firm New York stocks.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 8.00 percent from Monday's
8.030-percent finish. Their price rose to 83.46 points from 83.33.

   A jury Monday convicted three former
Northwest Airlines pilots of flying while intoxicated, rejecting
defense claims that the smoothness of the 91-passenger flight
proved they were not impaired.
   The convictions were the first under a 1986 federal law cracking
down on drinking and drug use in commercial transportation, said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth de la Vega.
   ``The impact of the trial was more than the verdict,'' she said.
``With the attention it's been given for months, it's had an impact
on pilots.''
   The felony convviction carries a maximum 15 years in prison and
a $250,000 fine. However, de la Vega said sentencing guidelines
called for prison terms of 12 to 18 months.
   ``I came into this expecting the worst, so in that sense I had
no surprise,'' said former Capt. Norman Lyle Prouse, who testified
he drank up to 20 rum and Diet Cokes at a lounge the night before
Flight 650 left Fargo, N.D., on March 8.
   The Boeing 727 landed safely at the Minneapolis-St. Paul
International Airport, where the pilots were arrested. A customer
who argued with one of the pilots at the lounge had reported them
to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Prouse, 51, of Conyers, Ga.; 1st Officer Robert Kirchner, 36, of
Highland Ranch, Colo.; and flight engineer Joseph Balzer, 35, of
Antioch, Tenn., each were convicted of one count of operating a
common carrier while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
   U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum ordered a presentence
investigation and released the defendants on their own recognizance.
   William Mauzy, attorney for Kirchner, said he would appeal.
Balzer's attorney, Bruce Hanley, declined to comment, and Peter
Wold, Prouse's lawyer, said he was considering an appeal.
   A waitress at the Speak Easy lounge in Moorhead, Minn., adjacent
to Fargo, testified that Prouse fell as he left the bar at about
11:30 p.m. and returned to get directions to his hotel, which was
about three blocks away.
   Balzer and Kirchner shared at least six pitchers of beer and
left the bar about an hour before Prouse, according to testimony.
   The plane left at 6:30 the next morning.
   Prouse, an acknowledged alcoholic who entered a treatment
program after his arrest, said he had little hope of flying again.
Balzer was more optimistic.
   ``It's kind of hard to keep a good pilot on the ground,'' Balzer
said. ``That's kind of like asking Picasso if he were going to
paint again.''
   The federal law against flying under the influence of alcohol
doesn't define drunkenness as a specific blood-alcohol level, as do
many state drunken-driving laws. However, it suggests that a pilot
with a blood-alcohol content of 0.1 percent would be impaired. The
law, adopted in 1986 and amended in 1988, also applies to those
controling commercial boats, trains and passenger-carrying buses.
   In tests about two hours after the plane landed, Prouse had a
blood-alcohol concentration of 0.13 percent, Kirchner's was 0.06
percent and Balzer's was 0.08 percent.
   Defense lawyers argued that the smoothness of the 40-minute
flight proved the pilots were not impaired.
   But de la Vega questioned whether they could have handled an
emergency.
   Herbert Moskowitz, a behavioral scientist, testified for the
prosecution that as little as half a can of beer can cause delayed
reactions.
   A blood-alcohol concentration of just 0.03 percent cause
significant impairment, he testified.
   ``I think it came down to the expert testimony of Dr.
Moskowitz,'' the prosecutor said. ``That was the key part of the
trial.''
   Jurors deliberated about nine hours on the case.
   Before the law was enacted, pilots were covered only by FAA
regulations.
   Northwest fired all three pilots for drinking within 12 hours of
a scheduled flight and the FAA revoked their licenses. The agency
forbids pilots from flying within eight hours of drinking or from
flying with a blood-alcohol content of 0.04 percent or more.
   The three also face misdemeanor charges in North Dakota.

<HEAD>Contractors Announce Agreement With Trump</HEAD>

   Donald Trump has reached an agreement
with a group representing about 60 contractors who say the
developer owed them $60 million for work on the Taj Mahal
casino-hotel, the creditors said Monday.
   The announcement was made one day before the state Casino
Control Commission is scheduled to rule on whether Trump can use
the Taj Mahal and his two other casinos as collateral for a $65
million emergency loan. Trump negotiated the loan to allow him to
make an overdue bond payment in June on the Trump Castle Casino
Resort By The Bay.
   Marty Rosenberg, a spokesman for a group of seven contractors
negotiating with Trump, said an agreement had been reached but did
not release details.
   ``I do not have the particulars of this agreement,'' Rosenberg
said at a news conference held at his business, Atlantic Plate
Glass, which was among the creditors.
   ``We will be meeting with the other contractors in the near
future,'' he said.
   Trump already faces at least four lawsuits for money allegedly
owed contractors who did roofing, ornamental, metal, fiber glass
and steel work on the Taj Mahal.
   His representatives have said they are auditing all work on the
casino to make sure it met their standards.
   Rosenberg indicated the negotiations had been arduous.
   ``We have had many, many meetings,'' he said. ``I have been in a
rush for a long time to get this finished.''
   The news conference began 2{ hours late as negotiators wrapped
up the final details, he said.
   ``If you've ever dealt with Donald Trump, you know he has his
own timetable,'' Rosenberg said.
