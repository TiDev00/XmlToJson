<HEAD>Farrakhan: Jews `Sucked Blood' of Black Community</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan told a university audience he owes no apology to his
Jewish critics because Jews have ``sucked the blood of the black
community.''
   Farrakhan spoke to about 4,000 people Sunday at Michigan State
University as Jewish students and others protested outside.
   The black Muslim minister, who has provoked controversy with
previous remarks about Jews, said Jews historically have exploited
and mistreated blacks. He said he owes no apology to Jewish critics
for his frequent attacks on Jews.
   ``You sucked the blood of the black community,'' Farrakhan said.
   About 200 protesters held a candlelight vigil before the speech
and others held a rally against racism earlier Sunday.
   ``He is a hatemonger as far as we are concerned,'' said
protester Mark Finkelstein, executive director of the Hillel Jewish
Student Center. ``We stand united against bigotry.''
   Farrakhan told the predominantly black audience that blacks were
demeaned in the movies he saw as a youngster. He blamed Jews in the
film industry.
   ``You wrote us in as clowns and buffoons,'' Farrakhan said. ``I
never did that to you, but you Jews did that to black people.''
   Security for the speech included police dogs sniffing the
auditorium and public safety officers scanning ticket-holders with
metal detectors. The searches delayed the speech for about an hour.

   Salvage crews have cut apart the last of
34 barges lodged at a dam since a New Year's Day accident that
halted Monongahela River traffic.
   The towing companies that owned the wayward vessels moved the
last barges from the Maxwell Dam 30 miles south of Pittsburgh on
Sunday. Many of them were cut apart and scrapped because of damage,
Army Corps of Engineers spokesman John Reed said.
   Three other barges sank and will not be recovered, Reed said.
   A 24-mile stretch of the river was closed for 17 days about a
week after 62 barges broke loose during high water and crashed
downstream. Thirty-four of the barges ended up behind the Maxwell
Dam.
   One barge leaked 10,000 gallons of gasoline into the river.

<HEAD>Norway's Arctic Fishermen Brave Hard Storms, Harder Times</HEAD>

   The tough Norwegians of the north can
ride out the savage storms, the isolation and the winter darkness
that lasts for two months. It is the region's shattered economy
that is forcing many to leave.
   ``Most people very strongly want to stay here. I can't explain
it. It's hard to make the people of south Norway understand, much
less foreigners,'' said Vigor Rossvaer, a University of Tromsoe
researcher.
   For unemployed fisherman Vidar Esbensen, the answer is simple:
``This is home.''
   The Norwegian arctic is vast, sparsely populated and beautiful,
with snow-capped mountains sloping down into the fjords and the
northern lights staging nightly shows. But gorgeous scenery doesn't
pay the mortgage.
   Unemployment, alcoholism and the death rate have long been
higher than the Norwegian average. Then in January, codfish quotas
were slashed to protect declining Barents Sea stocks, putting a
chokehold on the region's main income.
   ``You can't live on the quota, and you don't quite die from it
either,'' said Esbensen, 35, who was thrown out of work when the
cod quota was cut from 350,000 to 130,000 tons.
   Earlier this month the government offered a 500 million kroner
($77 million) bail-out package, mainly interest relief on state
loans, to tide fishermen over while long-term solutions are sought.
   Disappointed fishermen called the package ``a Band-Aid on a
bullet wound,'' and threatened strikes.
   In the northernmost province of Finnmark, unemployment is 7.7
percent compared to 3.9 percent in Oslo, Norway's capital. The
county population has been falling for 40 years, and dropped by 6.8
percent in the past decade to 75,000.
   A survey of those who left indicated that 51.6 percent sought
better jobs or schools, while 22.7 percent said they were driven
off by bad weather and the depressing 24-hour winter nights.
   Rossvaer said the north is a victim of ecology, economy and even
world politics. International pressure forced an end to whale
hunting, an important industry.
   Improving relations with the Soviet Union is both menacing and
encouraging, especially in Finnmark, which curls eastward, as if on
a mapmaker's whim, over northern Sweden and Finland to butt against
the Soviet Union along a 122-mile border.
   Some residents fear a scaling back of the permanent military
presence and periodic NATO maneuvers, which brought airports, bus
services, roads and employment to the north. On the other hand, an
open Soviet border could mean income from trade and tourism.
   Business analyst Sven Oppegaard predicts a reconstruction of the
region's economic and social base. Scattered hamlets, where
residents catch and process their own fish, will give way to
larger, more efficient centers, he says.
   Some fishing stations already are abandoned.
   ``We can't have a tiny village with a church, school and fish
factory on every little point of land,'' said Oppegaard, of the
Norwegian Confederation of Business and Industry.
   The military disagrees. Residents in villages dotting the long,
jagged coast report on Soviet naval activity, said Gunnar
Angeltveit of the Defense Ministry.
   Modern pressures are building up in this once-isolated,
tightly-knit coastal society, which may account for the 73 percent
increase in suicides from 1975 to 1985 and rising alcohol abuse,
said Rossvaer.
   ``There is a conflict of two cultures. One is modern Norway,
with its attractions, and the other is the traditional coastal
culture,'' he said.
   Northerners are friendly, open, imaginative, and sometimes
wishful. Most villages, even those seldom visited, have a local
polar museum, adorned with relics of seal and whale hunts.
   Locals scratching for opportunities see tourism as a way to help
preserve fading ways of life: whale hunting with cameras, reindeer
rides and dogsled treks. One suggested selling tourists neckties
made from salmon skins.
   ``We will do whatever we can to hang on,'' said Esbensen. ``It's
hard in the Barents, especially in storms, but there is a freedom
out there. I've tried working on land. I couldn't take it.''
   Not everyone can stick it out. Two years after its
fish-processing plant closed, the village of Bugoeynes won national
attention with an advertisement seeking a new home in the south _
anywhere with jobs and room for all 300 villagers.
   ``We don't really want to leave. This is a cry for help,'' one
villager admitted.
   ``They're a symbol of a people trying to keep their society
intact, even if it means moving south together,'' said Rossvaer.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of 13 people killed and 32
people injured in the collapse of a department store will share a
$33.1 million out-of-court settlement of lawsuits reached Monday,
attorneys said.
   The lawsuits were filed over the July 7, 1988, collapse of a
three-floor Amigo Store during a torrential thunderstorm in this
border town. Many of the injured were from Matamoros, Mexico, just
across the Rio Grande.
   A 14th person was killed, but relatives did not sue.
   Lawyer John Lewis, who represented some of the relatives and
injured, said a plaintiffs' committee of several attorneys reached
the agreement Monday with the last of nine defendants.
   Others who were injured reached independent settlements, said
another of the plaintiffs' attorneys, Mark Cantu.
   The settlement came with Amigo Stores Inc., Brownsville's Public
Utilities Board, the city of Brownsville and several construction
companies and materials suppliers, Cantu said.
   The defendants' insurance companies have committed to paying
varying amounts, depending on the percentage of liability
attributed to them, Cantu said. Individual amounts range from
$100,000 to $10 million, he said..
   Attorneys for the defendants were not in their offices late
Monday and could not be reached for comment.
   The effort to free those trapped in the rubble following the
collapse included hundreds of rescuers from throughout the lower
Rio Grande Valley and Mexico and other parts of the United States.
   The store site has been converted into a parking lot.

<DATELINE>TIRANA, Albania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sheep now feed off grass and overgrown
weeds covering millions of bunkers that were built years ago to
seal off Albania. Today, the fight against the world's ``corrupting
effects'' takes a different form.
   Western culture, although carefully monitored by bureaucrats and
intellectuals, seeps through the increasingly porous borders of
Europe's most isolated nation.
   Western ideas contrast sharply with Albanian orthodoxy but there
is little open evidence of any grass-roots disaffection threatening
to topple the last European refuge of Stalinism.
   Reports of anti-communist riots in the northern city of Skhoder
in January apparently were unfounded. Officials here charge they
were fabricated by the state-controlled media in Yugoslavia, which
is at odds with Albania over the fate of millions of ethnic
Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
   ``We do not want to assimilate; we want to preserve our national
identity,'' said Ymer Minxhozi, general secretary of the Albanian
Union of Journalists.
   ``We have no homosexuality, no prostitution, no drugs and no
black market,'' he told a group of visiting Western journalists.
   The bunkers, first built during World War II to guard against a
land invasion, were vastly expanded after the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact marched into Czechoslovakia in 1968. Now they are falling into
disuse.
   No one knows exactly how many bunkers there are, but one
official estimated at least one for every Albanian _ 3 million.
   ``The bunkers in Albania do not move ... they have no feet or
wheels. They do not threaten anyone,'' Deputy Foreign Minister
Socrat Placa said in an interview.
   During its 45-year history as a Stalinist state, Albania has had
little to do with the world beyond its borders. It still reveres
the memory of Josef Stalin and adheres strictly to Marxist-Leninist
doctrine.
   Albania cut ties with the Soviet Union in 1961 because of its
de-Stalinization program and with China in 1978 because of China's
perceived deviation from Marxist-Leninist policies after Mao
Tse-tung's death.
   Enver Hoxha, the founder of the communist state in Albania, died
in 1985, but his policies and personality cult survive. A Hoxha
museum opened last year, a marble and glass temple among Tirana's
dilapidated and windowless buildings.
   Hoxha's successor, Ramiz Alia, is credited with introducing some
openness and acknowledgement of deficiencies of the Albanian
system. Mistrust and hostility toward Moscow and Washington remain,
however.
   Placa made no effort to disguise his satisfaction when he heard
a Western news report on a visiting reporter's radio of an
explosion at a Soviet military base in Czechoslovakia.
   ``Good, good, very good. ... Of course it may have some
consequences but is a good lesson for Gorbachev,'' Placa said.
   Nevertheless, Placa said, discussions were under way to further
increase ties with ``both East and West.''
   Albanians are able to view Italian, Yugoslavian and Greek
television. Scrawled on a shutter of a backstreet shop in Tirana
were the words, ``IRON MAIDEN,'' a leading British heavy-rock band.
   In another part of town, someone had repeatedly written ``liri''
(freedom) on a kiosk wall, an uncommon slogan in a country with a
powerful secret police, the Sigurimi.
   Activities of the Sigurimi were assailed last year, however, in
a best-selling novel by writer Neshat Tozaj, who works as a
criminal investigator in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   The novel, ``Thikat'' (Knives), portrayed the Sigurimi as
falsifying evidence and making illegal arrests and detentions.
   Publication of a book exposing abuses of the secret police could
indicate a relaxation of censorship or, as some Western observers
suggested, a power struggle to restrict the Sigurimi.
   ``The artistic qualities of the book were criticized but it
touched on certain themes in our society. ... Life must be
reflected in literature,'' said Nasi Lera, secretary of the
Albanian Union of Artists and Writers.
   Authorities still want to stop controversial material about
Albania from reaching abroad.
   Visiting Finnish television journalists found on their return
home evidence of tampering with an interview with Foreign Minister
Reiz Malile, which had been filmed by a local crew.
   Malile had acknowledged on camera that Albania had some
political prisoners but added, ``It's not a problem.'' That section
of tape was replaced by a segment of an Albanian song contest.
   Modern Western literature is translated into Albanian, and
William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote
are better known than Spanish, Italian or French writers, said
Ismail Kadare, Albania's best-known modern author.
   ``We don't approve of pornography ... and our greatest problem
is mediocrity. But that's a worldwide problem,'' Kadare added in an
interview.
   ``The West definitely has a corrupting influence ... even though
we must respect them for their marvelous scientific achievements
and progress,'' a 21-year-old woman said.
   She added she would like to go abroad in a student exchange
program, then said, ``But things are so good here.''

<HEAD>`State-of-the-Art' Oil Cleanup Called Primitive by Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The oil spill that fouled California's coast
brought scenes of work gangs with towels and pads swabbing gooey
beaches using methods industry called state-of-the-art but
environmentalists panned as primitive.
   ``We're watching a very crude burlesque show which unfortunately
cannot get the job done,'' said Bob Sulnick, head of American
Oceans Campaign, a Santa Monica-based environmental group.
   ``This spill unequivocally demonstrates you really can't clean
up an oil spill.''
   Oil company officials said the industry is doing the best it
can, and plans a multimillion-dollar effort to develop better
cleanup methods.
   ``Rather than dwell on the shortcomings of the state-of-the-art
as they now exist, I'd try to look to the future,'' American
Petroleum Institute spokesman Bill Taylor said by phone from
Washington.
   On Feb. 7, the tanker American Trader spilled 400,000 gallons of
British Petroleum America Inc. oil off Huntington Beach, polluting
some 14 miles of Southern California coastline, killing scores of
birds and ruining business for local fishermen.
   The Coast Guard estimated last week that skimming boats cleaned
up more than a third of the oil, while nearly half evaporated or
dissipated in the ocean. The rest hit the beach.
   Bays and wetlands were sealed off with booms and temporary dams.
Vacuum trucks helped keep oil from the Santa Ana River.
   Unlike last year's nearly 11-million-gallon Exxon Valdez spill
on Alaska's rocky beaches, high-pressure hoses were not used on
sandy California shores.
   But television scenes still were dominated by the spectacle of
hundreds of yellow-suited cleanup workers raking up the mess and
dabbing globs of oil using absorbent pompons, towels and pads that
looked like big diapers.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jack Kemerer said he wouldn't call cleanup
technology primitive, but ``it hasn't changed much in the last 10
or 15 years.''
   Cleaning the sand with absorbent pads ``may look primitive, but
I don't think it is,'' Kemerer said. ``In this case it's probably
the most effective way to do it without destroying the beach''
using bulldozers to scoop up oily sand.
   Others were harsher in assessing cleanup methods.
   ``Politically you have to put on a show by hiring people and
having them mop up whatever oil they can mop up,'' Sulnick said.
``But people ought not to believe that's a cleanup. This oil will
be in the environment for a decade.''
   A spokesman for British Petroleum defended the cleanup.
   ``This cleanup used the best technology that's available ...
even though the technology seems primitive and very, very labor
intensive,'' said Tom Thomson.
   He said officials must consider possible environmental damage
from cleanup methods, which is why toxic chemical dispersants were
not used on the near-shore spill.
   Kemerer, executive officer of the Pacific Area Strike Team that
responds to oil and toxic spills, said the oil industry and
government have not spent enough money on research and development
of new cleanup methods.
   ``I'm sure on the government side it was budgetary
constraints,'' he said. ``There probably was some complacency.
There weren't any big spills for some time.''
   Since the Exxon Valdez spill, the oil companies are forming a
``petroleum industry response organization'' that will spend
millions to study and develop better methods to recover spilled oil
and prevent and reduce harm to shorelines, Taylor said.
   The effort will seek improvements in oil-eating bacteria,
methods to wash oil off land, boom designs, absorbent materials,
oil-coagulating gels and oil disposal techniques, he added.
   Thomson said that ``safety is clearly a top-of-the-mind issue in
the industry,'' and cleanup methods will improve.
   But the oil company spokesman added: ``The unfortunate part of
it is that technology gets developed as a result of crises like the
Exxon Valdez disaster and the American Trader disaster.''
   Ann Notthoff of the Natural Resources Defense Council's San
Francisco office said she is waiting for some results.
   ``Both the federal government and the oil companies haven't
taken the risk of spills seriously,'' she said.
   ``They clearly have not invested in prevention measures. They
resisted double hull requirements (for tankers). ... They haven't
invested much in development of stronger cleanup technology.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Western visitor to Poland tried to call
his Warsaw office from the airport Jan. 17. Instead of a
connection, he got a close-up look at Poland in reform.
   Pay phone rates quadrupled that day, although at five calls per
penny they were still a bargain to the average Westerner. That is,
to any Westerner who has the right size 20-zloty coin and can find
a phone that works.
   In Poland, like in much of Eastern Europe, doing business comes
down to overcoming the daily little difficulties.
   The airport bank and the bar laughed him off. Downstairs, the
lady who tended the public toilets obliged with five coins in
exchange for the remainder of a 500-zloty note, a nickel tip.
   All three phones on the wall were kaput. A short hike away, in
the domestic terminal, four phones refused to take coins. Two did
and would not surrender them.
   The visitor wasn't surprised. Poland's direct-dial system to
Western Europe produced fewer successful first attempts than the
Marriott Casino awarded jackpots. Trying to phone New York could
take all day.
   Poles often have trouble calling across town.
   An option might be the mail. But a colleague tried that the same
day. All the post office clerk had to offer were stamps of such
small denomination that they would cover both sides of a postcard.

<HEAD>Tiny Molluscs Imperil Water Supplies, Power Plants, Fishing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Wilfred LePage saw his first zebra mussel Feb. 1. By September,
thousands of the tiny molluscs jammed the intake of the water
treatment plant he manages, cutting the flow 20 percent and nearly
sparking a water emergency.
   ``There is no cheap solution to it and there's no real cure to
the problem,'' said LePage, water treatment superintendent in
Monroe, Mich., on Lake Erie's western edge.
   At the eastern end of the lake, in Dunkirk, N.Y., the
green-and-yellow striped shellfish first appeared Oct. 3, and now
infest a Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. generating plant. December's
deep freeze stopped them from clogging water intakes but they
quickly settled inside the plant.
   ``They like it where it's dimly lit, they like it where it's
warm, and they don't like a lot of turbulence. This place is ideal
for them,'' said Robert C. Henderson, a chemical lab supervisor at
the plant. ``By July, we're going to have a massive problem with
them.''
   Three years after they were introduced to North America and
after only one year in Lake Erie, zebra mussels have spread
throughout the lake and have been spotted at the entrance to Lake
Ontario and along the St. Lawrence River. It's an invasion
scientists say could affect farming, fishing and daily life along
virtually every body of fresh water in North America in the next
few years.
   The mussels are mostly about a half-inch long, although they can
reach 2 inches during their five-year lifespans. They eat by
filtering microscopic food particles from the water, and love
intake pipes of water and power plants because the current brings
them a steady supply of fresh food.
   A mussel can filter more than a gallon of water an hour, said R.
Warren Flint, a scientist with the Great Lakes Program at the State
University of New York-Buffalo. As a result, they will leave water
cleaner than before. ``From an aesthetic perspective, that would
certainly be a benefit, I guess,'' he said.
   Europeans have used zebra mussels to clean algae-choked ponds,
and the shells can be used to add calcium to livestock feed, said
Charles O'Neill, with the Sea Grant program at the State University
College at Brockport.
   The mussels also are a good source of food for diving ducks and
some kinds of fish, including sturgeons and eels, Flint said. But
with millions of them at work filtering microscopic food, they
could deplete the supply for the small fish that support the
billion-dollar walleye- and bass-fishing industry.
   And the bad news could spread beyond the lake and its shoreline.
Farmers and golf courses that draw irrigation water from the lakes
can expect problems, and beachgoers will have to wear shoes because
of the shells, O'Neill said.
   ``It can affect everything from the electricity at your outlet
to the water at your tap,'' O'Neill said. ``It's not just an
environmental problem.''
   Like their distant cousins, the blue mussels, zebras ought, in
theory, to be edible by humans, Flint said. But when Canadian
researchers tried steaming a bunch, O'Neill said, ``What they got
was a stench that cleared the lab.''
   The mussels have plagued Europe for more than a century and are
believed to have arrived in North America on a freighter that
emptied its ballast tanks in Lake St. Clair, upstream from Lake
Erie, in 1986.
   Scientists are studying the possibility that the Lake Erie
infestations came from several ships rather than that single 1986
event, O'Neill said. But Flint said one colony could have infested
the lake because one mussel can lay 30,000 to 50,000 eggs a year
and the larvae can swim for up to two weeks before growing shells.
``They could easily get across Lake Erie or Lake Ontario in that
period of time,'' he said.
   For public water systems, controlling the mussels is a matter of
applying chlorine, ozone or other disinfectants at the mouth of the
intake pipe rather than waiting until the water is inside the
plant, say scientists and plant operators like LePage who have
already faced the problem.
   Power plants have a different problem, because officials are
reluctant to let them put chlorine or other disinfectants in
cooling water discharged back to the lake, Henderson said. Niagara
Mohawk and the state Department of Environmental Conservation are
negotiating a solution.
   James Sell, chief operator of the Dunkirk water plant, is
studying ways of getting chlorine to the pipe's mouth, like
building a platform over the intake or running a smaller chlorine
pipe out through the intake. ``We're better off than the people in
the western end of the lake,'' Sell said.
   ``At least we have some time to do something by spring.''
   The City Council hasn't been persuaded to pay up to $100,000 for
the plans, but Sell, who keeps three living mussels in a jar to
show visitors, said, ``I don't see much option for them if they
want a water supply.''
   Farther inland, many water officials are unaware of the problem
or not prepared to do anything about it. Michael Burke, director of
the state Health Department's bureau of public water supply
protection, said the department was studying the problem but
doesn't see the need to issue warnings. ``I think the word's
getting to them, particularly those with large surface intakes in
the Great Lakes. It is coming out in industry papers and things of
that sort.''
   O'Neill and other scientists said the state should do more to
get the word out, because it is only a matter of time _ and not
necessarily very much time.
   ``The chances of them getting into the western reach of the Erie
Canal is good,'' O'Neill said. ``The canal is an ideal place for
them to live. It's warm. It's shallow. Most of it has rock riprap
to attach to.''
   Pleasure boats can also carry mussels and their larvae in their
engine housings and other places where water collects.
   Once the mussels get into Lake Michigan, they will almost
certainly spread through the Chicago River and into the Mississippi
River basin, O'Neill said. ``Any area in North America that is
utilizing surface water should be concerned.''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city of Al Capone and feisty politics has
been abuzz for a week over claims by a suspected crime boss that
the mob bribed local politicans and even helped engineer Mayor
Richard M. Daley's election last year.
   Cook County Republican Party Chairman James Dvorak is at the
uncomfortable center of the controversy over allegations he was
paid thousands of mob dollars in bribes. He and others hit by the
taped-recorded allegations, including his one-time boss, Sheriff
James O'Grady, deny the claims.
   There also are questions about why federal prosecutors would let
explosive taped allegations against known officials be played in
open court with no advance notice, little follow-up and, to date,
no criminal charges filed.
   The tapes dominated local newscasts and had wide play in
Chicago's two largest daily newspapers, the Chicago Tribune and
Chicago Sun-Times. Tribune columnist Mike Royko, though a longtime
critic of politicians, said the feds' tactics were unfair.
   ``It seems to me that the federal prosecutors, out of fairness,
should do something more than play a tape that causes a media
uproar, then clam up,'' wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning
commentator.
   ``It's great fun for the news business and for the political
enemies of those mentioned on the tape,'' Royko wrote. ``But I
didn't know that the Justice Department believed in trial by a jury
of gossip column items.''
   Ira Raphaelson, acting U.S. attorney, declined to comment on the
tapes' release.
   The story began with a continuing federal probe into organized
crime that yielded indictments of 20 people and allegations that
they used murder, other violence and threats to run a gambling
operation.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh jetted in to announce the
busts in a Feb. 7 news conference, calling the operation one of the
largest crackdowns ever on organized crime in Chicago.
   That generated some interest, but nothing like the detention
hearing two days later that sent politicians scrambling to clear
their names.
   At that hearing, prosecutors played a secretly recorded
conversation of Rocco Infelise, a reputed mob gambling boss, in
which he talked about payoffs to officials and about influencing
the last Chicago mayoral race.
   In the Sept. 14 conversation with William Jahoda, a
bookie-turned-informant who was wearing a ``wire,'' Infelise said
he had been making $35,000 in monthly payoffs to police and
officials. Included, he said, was $10,000 a month to the sheriff's
office.
   ``I lay out $35,000 a month for guys that are away and the
coppers,'' Infelise said on the tape. ``Between you and I, 10 goes
to the sheriff.''
   What do you get for the $10,000, he was asked by Jahoda.
   ``Sheriff never bothers us,'' he replied. ``Then we've got a guy
at the state's attorney's office. We got another guy downtown.''
Media reports interpreted ``guys that are away'' as jailed mobsters
and ``another guy downtown'' as a federal law enforcement official.
   The tape said the payments were made through somebody called
``the Bohemian.'' IRS agent Thomas Moriarty said in court that
Jahoda, who also is under indictment, identified the Bohemian as
Dvorak, the county GOP chairman who had been O'Grady's top
assistant.
   Dvorak denied the allegations, a did O'Grady. ``If this were
true, I would be in Argentina right now, not before you,'' Dvorak
said at a news conference.
   But the political firing line was established.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan, leading contender for
the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, called on his GOP
counterpart, Secretary of State Jim Edgar, to explain his
relationship to Dvorak.
   Republican Steven Baer, a conservative hoping to upset Edgar in
the March 20 primary, chimed in that Edgar should get to the bottom
of the allegations.
   An Edgar spokesman called Hartigan and Baer ``phonies.'' Edgar
then called for Dvorak's resignation to preserve the party. Gov.
James R. Thompson, the state's top Republican who had backed
Dvorak's rise to the chairmanship, agreed.
   Dvorak, who acknowledged federal authorities told him in a
letter he was the ``subject'' of an investigation though not a
target, said he'd finish his term. It ends in April, and he said he
might seek another one.
   Infelise also boasted on the tape that his organizaton helped
Daley win election last year by pressuring real estate tycoon
Edward DeBatolo not to contribute to rival Edward Vrdolyak, a
former alderman.
   Raphaelson countered that Daley was not a subject of the federal
investigation, and even Infelise's attorney, Patrick Tuite, said
his client's tape was ``hot air.''
   Daley had another characterization: ``A bunch of B.S.''
   Observers say the case proves an old truth: Politicians can ill
afford negative charges, even if no wrongdoing is proved or charges
pressed.
   ``Politics, like life, is not fair,'' said Paul Green, a
political science professor at Governors State University in
suburban University Park who follows the Chicago scene. ``Legal
nuances ... politically, are irrelevant.''

<TEXT>
   After decades of making people nervous, Bernt
Murphy just wants to be left alone to pick up the pieces of a life
misspent in a mental hospital.
   He even bought a welcome mat for the group home he shares with
other retarded men so his neighbors will know they are harmless.
But it's received precious little wear.
   Sometimes Murphy can only laugh at the fright he inspires.
   ``We keep seeing this white car at the end of the street by the
fruit stand,'' he said. ``I think one night I might go knock on the
window with a flashlight and ask what he's doing.''
   Mildly retarded at birth, Murphy was 19 when he was arrested in
1957 on charges he raped and beat a 5-year-old girl. During
questioning about that crime, police said he confessed to a murder
two years before of a 23-year-old woman Murphy had known as a
student at the Utah State Training School for the mentally retarded.
   He was judged incompetent to stand trial for rape and was never
charged with the murder. His attorneys now claim Murphy was a
convenient suspect who admitted responsibility for the slaying
under intense pressure from police.
   Declared insane, Murphy spent more than three decades at the
Utah State Hospital in Provo until the Utah Supreme Court ruled in
1988 that Murphy was mentally retarded, not insane, and ordered a
plan for releasing him.
   Last month, after spending a year living in quarters on the edge
of hospital property and holding an outside job, he was secretly
whisked to the duplex in nearby Orem. He shares it with three other
s identity and smed a City Council meeting to demand his removal.
   A spokesman for the neighbors, Rich Persons, said their concern
stems from lack of information about the residents.
   ``No one from the state will step forward and tell us if these
people are dangerous or not,'' he said. ``If the innuendos are
correct and they are dangerous, why dump them in the middle of
7,000 children?''
   Murphy's attorney, Lisa Marcy, said she repeatedly has assured
the neighbors the men aren't dangerous. ``How many times do they
need to hear it?'' she said.
   Nevertheless, the City Council voted to require the private
operators of the group home to obtain a business use permit even
though the area is zoned residential. Murphy's attorneys say they
are prepared to file federal complaints to keep t.
   ``The Fair Housing Act that applies to Bernt is the same one
that prevenlacks, Hispanics or women from being moved out of
neighborhoods,'' Marcy said. ohn Anderson, program specialistthe
state Division of Handicapped Services, scoffs at the idea that
Murphy is a threat to anyone. He said the duplex should qualify as
an apartment program for handicapped adults, which normally would
not require a permit.
   ``I just they'd leave us alone and quit g us,'' Murphy the diner
where he has worked for nearly a year as a dishwasher and janitor,
helping pay for his living expenses.
   Dressed in a 1950s-style suit coat for his first formal
interview with a reporter, Murphy, 52, recalled his amusement at
seeing 1960s TV footage of himself going to court in handcuffs.
   ``That didn't even look like me,'' he said, an assessment echoed
by his attorney, who has seen Murphy blossom outside the
institutional environment. ``He's a different person now,'' Marcy
said. ``The longer he is away from the institution, the better he
gets.''
   Murphy proudly tells of losing several pounds following a
vigorous walking program prescribed by his doctor and tries to
avoid salt. Indeed, he looks far younger than his 52 years, despite
chronic back trouble.
   Murphy arises at 5 a.m. so he can be ready for work by 7:30. He
is driven the two miles to and from the diner by a job adviser. He
had been permitted to ride the bus until his neighbors learned his
identity.
   Murphy said that one of his first purchases after leaving the
hospital grounds was a spotted dog he named Brittney.
   ``I'm teaching her to sit and stay,'' he said. Murphy also
bought a doghouse and a down-filled blanket to keep Brittney warm
at night.
   Murphy's duplex is staffed by supervisors 24 hours a day and he
cannot go on unaccompanied outings.
   Earlier this month, Murphy dated a woman from a neighboring
group home. They went dancing in matching shirts and likely will do
so again soon. ``She's a real nice girl,'' he said.
   His employer, Julie Rees, is pleased with Murphy's progress but
disturbed by the friction with his neighbors and the attention it
received.
   ``I think the accounts of his life have been unfair,'' she said,
``If you plaster a person's face all over the (television) screen,
there will be no place he can live.''

<HEAD>De Klerk And Mandela Work Together For Peace In South Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From completely different
worlds, Nelson Mandela and President F.W. de Klerk are trying to
find a common ground between South Africa's whites and blacks and
bring peace to their divided country.
   Despite opposition and threats from opponents and extremists on
both sides, the two men are forming an unlikely alliance in their
quest to end centuries of racial conflict and replace
white-minority rule with a power-sharing arrangement.
   De Klerk, head of the party that created apartheid to enforce
white rule, comes from a background of wealth and privilege.
Mandela, who endured 27 years in prison for fighting white-minority
rule, lived amid the poor black masses, struggling to get an
education.
   ``Mr. de Klerk and Mr. Mandela have established a relationship
that could be the key in a society so rigidly divided by race
politics,'' said the Rev. Jesse Jackson after seeing the two men.
   In a bold attempt to start negotiations on political reform, de
Klerk legalized the African National Congress and other black
opposition groups and released Mandela from prison Feb. 11.
   In what promises to be an equally important step, the African
National Congress, the main anti-apartheid group, announced from
its headquarters in Zambia on Friday that it would send delegates
for peace talks with de Klerk.
   Many South Africans have been deeply impressed by the resolution
and vision of Mandela and de Klerk. After years of worrying about
an uncertain future, the two men have created hope that the
country's divisions can be solved.
   In a typical example of the positive white reaction to Mandela,
The Star newspaper wrote, ``Groups supporting him are ecstatic,
believing he has done everything expected of him _ and more _ in
proving his transcending leadership qualities.''
   Jubilant blacks celebrating Mandela's release showed a new
attitude to the white government by chanting, ``Viva Comrade de
Klerk.''
   The two men have expressed admiration for each other and
reportedly have established a personal rapport. Both appear to be
strong leaders with intelligence and a dramatic ability to seize
the initiative.
   Mandela and de Klerk say South Africa's many ethnic and tribal
groups must sit down and work out a new future where the rights of
all are ensured or face the threat of war.
   Mandela, while saying he supports continued armed struggle
against the apartheid system, has stressed the need for compromise.
Since his release, he has said he is willing to negotiate on
everything, including the long-standing black demand of one-man,
one-vote and full democracy.
   ``Compromise must be made in respect to every issue, as long as
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population
group, but the country as a whole,'' he said in an interview.
   He has repeatedly stressed that whites face no threat in a
democratic South Africa.
   De Klerk also stresses compromise. ``All of us now have an
opportunity and the responsibility to prove that we are capable of
a peaceful process in creating a new South Africa,'' he said.
   But de Klerk and Mandela will need far more than good intentions
to solve the enormous problems confronting South Africa. The two
sides are far apart on most major issues.
   The governing National Party says it opposes majority rule
because the 5 million whites would be swamped by the 28 million
blacks. Government leaders favor a constitution based on ``group
rights'' where the whites would retain some hold on power.
   Mandela has said economic and social divisions are just as big a
problem as political inequality. South Africa's wealth is
concentrated in white hands, and most blacks still live in squalid
townships or barren rural areas, struggling to survive.
   ``Our people need proper housing, not ghettos ... our people
need a living wage,'' Mandela said.
   But while many whites want a political solution, there are few
signs that they are willing to give up their high standards of
living and accept a major redistribution of wealth.
   Many whites want to keep segregated neighborhoods, schools and
other facilities, but blacks want rapid change and integration.
   The two leaders also face opposition from within their own
ranks. Black and white hard-liners oppose any kind of peaceful
compromise.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party is attempting to rally
whites to oust de Klerk and force new elections. Up to 40,000 angry
whites marched in Pretoria Feb. 15 as the Conservatives began a
campaign to halt the government's reforms.
   ``It's a complete capitulation. When the time comes and they
want to enforce black communist government on the whites, they will
have to do it by force. We won't accept it peacefully,'' said Koos
van der Merwe, a spokesman for the Conservatives.
   Black opposition groups are also split. Groups such as the Pan
African Congress have used slogans such as, ``One (white) settler,
one bullet'' and traditional tribal leaders oppose any settlement
that would deprive them of power.
   De Klerk and Mandela will have to retain substantial support in
their respective constitutencies as they begin to make concessions
at the negotiating table. They are likely to need all of their
strength and skills to retain support and preserve stability in the
months ahead.

   The patched-up tanker American Trader
left port Sunday for San Francisco, where it will undergo final
repairs to a gashed hull that leaked 400,000 gallons of oil off
Southern California.
   The ship left the Port of Long Beach at about 4:15 p.m., after
inspectors ruled it had been made seaworthy by temporary repairs,
said Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely.
   The trip up the coast was expected to take about two days, Ms.
Neely said.
   The oil spilled from the gashed hull Feb. 7, two miles off
Huntington Beach, as the ship's crew maneuvered to unload the
tanker's cargo of crude oil into a submerged pipeline. Authorities
said the tanker _ chartered by British Petroleum _ may have
collided with its own anchor.
   Also Sunday, cleanup experts were trying to decide how to get
rid of oil coating rock jetties between the Newport Beach pier and
the Santa Ana River, along the coast south of Los Angeles.
   ``They're talking about using sea water heated to 85 degrees,
which is warm enough to liquefy the petroleum on the rocks but
wouldn't cook any creatures,'' said Newport fire Capt. Ray
Pendleton.
   About 300 cleanup workers were on the beaches between Huntington
Beach and Laguna Beach, and their numbers may be reduced as the
project winds down, said Tony Kozlowski, a British Petroleum
spokesman.
   The spill forced closure of about 15 miles of beaches and two
harbors and economically hurt charter boat operators, whose craft
are trapped inside the harbors.
   The Coast Guard announced Sunday that Newport Harbor would
reopen sometime Monday. Ms. Neely said conditions there improved
greatly during the weekend.
   Booms would remain in place at Newport Harbor, but ships could
pass through a gate that would be installed, she said.
   There still was no timetable for opening the Anaheim Bay harbor.
   As of Sunday, the oil had killed 300 birds and covered another
461 birds in oil, state Fish and Game officials said. Two of four
sea lions found soaked in oil have also died.

   If the masses of human hair turn matted
and the piles of inmates' shoes fall apart, museum conservators
wonder how future generations will know the horror of the Auschwitz
concentration camp.
   Alarmed by the worsening condition of the barracks, gas
chambers, crematoria and archives of victims' belongings, a team of
Western specialists has volunteered to map out a preservation
effort that could cost up to $40 million.
   The Culture Ministry of the new non-Communist Polish government
also has formed a commission to change the 35-year-old museum
exhibition, which highlights the Soviet army's liberation of the
camp but mentions the Holocaust only in passing.
   ``If nothing is done, in 10 to 20 years, this site will be
practically non-existent,'' said Frank Reiss, vice president of the
New York-based Ronald S. Lauder Foundation. ``It is falling apart.
It is in urgent need of repair.''
   The foundation struck an agreement with the government-run
museum to provide technical advice and raise funds for the
preservation. It sent a team of experts, including the chief
conservator from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, to assess
the damage in December.
   ``The tens of thousands of pairs of shoes .... if you touch
them, they fall to dust,'' Reiss said. ``The ruins of the gas
chambers ... they have to be preserved _ but as ruins, not put back
together Hollywood style.''
   Nazi Germany built the Auschwitz concentration camp and the
adjacent Birkenau death camp in southern Poland to carry out Adolf
Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' Estimates of the number of people
killed there range to 4 million, mostly Jews from across Europe.
Victims also included Gypsies, homosexuals and political prisoners.
   Partly demolished as the Red Army approached, Auschwitz was
liberated on Jan. 27, 1945. The camp remains much as it was left:
the sign reading in German ``Work Makes You Free'' above the gates,
the train tracks bisecting the vast expanse of Birkenau and ending
feet from its destroyed crematoria.
   Inside a brick barracks at Auschwitz is a museum exhibit opened
in the mid-1950s. The masses of hair, piles of shoes and mounds of
eyeglasses, artificial limbs, suitcases and baby clothes give the
human toll a vivid dimension.
   The museum staff, headed by former inmate Kazimierz Smolen, has
struggled with the beautifying effect of ever-growing grass, the
soothing sound of birds singing and the government's limited
resources to maintain the camp's hellish authenticity.
   It is left largely to the silent testimony of the names on the
suitcases and a separate, less-visited exhibit supported by foreign
Jewish groups to remind visitors that the camp existed mainly to
exterminate Jews.
   The site is officially known as a ``Monument to the Martyrdom of
the Polish and Other Nations.'' The official guidebook describes
the concentration camps as the main Nazi weapon against ``conquered
people, mainly Slavs, above all the Polish nation and the peoples
of the U.S.S.R., as well as Jews and other persons considered to be
such.''
   Poland's new government is ready to tackle such sensitive
issues. Pro-Solidarity Culture Minister Izabella Cywinska has named
an independent Auschwitz commission, including museum experts and
religious experts.
   ``The commission is to see whether the exhibition fully reflects
the historical truth and whether it speaks to younger
generations,'' said Krystyna Marszalek-Mlynczyk, the vice minister
leading the panel.
   Commissioners found many problems with the exhibit commentary on
a recent inspection.
   ``There is a phrase: `All Poles spontaneously helped Jews.'
Every word of this phrase could be questioned,'' said Francisiek
Cemka, head of the Department of Museums.
   ``It was not all, and it was not always spontaneous. They were
under the threat of death, so one was more bold, one was less,'' he
said.
   Reiss said the foundation wants the preservation effort to
ensure ``that the real story be told, that at Birkenau, 95 percent
or more of the prisoners killed were Jews.''
   The Polish and international teams also face difficult
conservation problems, such as how to preserve barracks built by
inmate laborers.
   ``We cannot just replace the barracks with new timber or
strengthen the roofs with concrete, as they will tell us later that
we have falsified it all,'' Ms. Marszalek-Mlynczyk said.
   Pollution and a rainy climate also make things worse, Smolen
said.
   Still, there is no imminent danger to the artifacts, the museum
director said. His staff of 175 already has a preservation program
in place, though with limited funds. The museum had a 1989
conservation budget of about $35,000.
   With as many as 10,000 visitors coming daily to the museum, the
commission also plans to work with the surrounding town on
developing accommodations, including the interfaith prayer center
to house nuns whose convent on the camp perimeter led to a dispute
with Jewish groups.
   ``I hate to be pragmatic about these things, but Auschwitz is a
No. 1 tourist attraction in Poland,'' Reiss said.

   U.S. experts on Eastern Europe admit they were
caught napping by the speed of the move toward German
reunification, and many say Mikhail S. Gorbachev's unpredictable
moves are what took them by surprise.
   ``Whom has he not surprised?'' asked Yale historian Henry Ashby
Turner, author of ``The Two Germanies Since 1945.''
   ``I was in East Germany last summer, I confess, and I said 10
years at that point'' before East and West Germany could be
unified, Turner said.
   ``It was hard for all of the experts to conclude that Gorbachev
was willing to dismantle the Soviet empire,'' said Kim Holmes,
director of foreign policy and defense studies for the conservative
Heritage Foundation. ``We had to make that leap.''
   Former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias, R-Md., president of the
American Council on Germany, said, ``The world at large has been
surprised at the speed with which it has gone because there were
substantial obstacles that could have been expected to slow it
down, and they have simply just collapsed.''
   Among those obstacles, said Mathias, were ``the assumption that
the Russians would never agree to it, the concern that Western
Europe thought it might feel about an enlarged Germany, the
economic consequences that people foresaw.''
   But those obstacles were not as formidable as was previously
thought, he said, adding that there was ``no question'' that
Gorbachev was a major factor.
   Michael Geyer, German-born historian at the University of
Chicago, said the Soviet leader's support of moves leading toward
reunification ``did come as a surprise and so far I have seen no
good interpretation of what he's doing.''
   James A. Smith, a historian who has written a book on think
tanks and is an acknowledged expert on the experts, says Gorbachev
may be part of what took them by surprise.
   However, Smith said, ``Much of it is that the pace of change has
simply outstripped the assumptions of the past 40 years.''
   In addition, Smith suggested that developments such as facsimile
machines, cable television, satellites and improvements in
telephones were helping fuel unrest faster than the experts knew.
   Whatever the reason, many scholars acknowledge they were having
trouble with their crystal balls.
   ``They couldn't see the forest for the trees because they were
so involved in discussing how you count aircraft and all the arcane
aspects of nuclear strategy and NATO doctrine,'' said the Heritage
Foundation's Holmes. ``When these seismic changes were occurring
they were very slow to see what the implications were.''
   Holmes said he was thinking in terms of two or three years when
he told a reporter in October that ``it could happen a lot sooner
than a lot of people think.''
   Now, said Turner, ``I would say that by the end of the year, in
many respects, there will be de facto reunification.''
   ``It now looks as though it is possible within a year,'' Mathias
agreed. ``Some aspects of it might string out for a couple of
years, but the fact is something has to happen pretty fast.''
   Events are indeed moving rapidly. On Monday in Ottawa, the
United States, West Germany, Britain and France agreed on
international conferences on security aspects of unification,
possibly soon after the March 18 East German elections.
   On Tuesday in Bonn, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East
German Prime Minister Hans Modrow agreed to start work on adopting
West German currency for both countries. On Wednesday, the West
German government said the final obstacles to reunification had
been removed.
   Gorbachev was the key, Turner said. ``Mikhail Gorbachev is a
very unpredictable man. If he had decided to back up (former East
German president Erich) Honecker, Honecker would still be there.''
   Holmes, while stressing the importance of Gorbachev's steps,
cautioned, ``This, of course, has not been played out yet, and we
are not fully certain of what the consequences are going to be.''
   Former Secretary of State William Rogers, asked in November
about the outlook for one Germany, said he thought it would be a
reality when East and West Germany fielded one Olympic team, and he
didn't expect this to happen before two four-year Olympic cycles
were completed. Now, reports from West Berlin say a reuniting of
the two countries' Olympic teams for the 1992 games is considered
likely.

<TEXT>
   After years of championing better
East-West relations, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of
West Germany returned to his East German hometown to be hailed as
the architect of unification.
   The whirlwind events of the last few months have bolstered
Genscher, one of the first to take Mikhail S. Gorbachev at his word
when the Soviet leader promised reform.
   Even occasional backbiting by U.S. and British officials failed
to stop Genscher, an affable and unflappable veteran diplomat whose
protruding ``elephant ears'' have become his trademark.
   Referring to Genscher's legendary globe-trotting, Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze once joked that whenever two airliners
cross paths over the Atlantic, ``Genscher is on both of them.''
   While German unification itself would be his crowning
achievement, Genscher's trip back home Friday to the decaying
industrial city of Halle provided an emotional high point.
   About 60,000 people crammed into the marketplace to give him a
rousing hero's welcome, handing the 62-year-old diplomat flowers
and chanting for him to stay with them.
   While the outdoor event was a campaign rally for the East German
counterpart of Genscher's Free Democrats, there was no doubt about
the real star of the show.
   A large banner on the town hall steps read ``Halle Welcomes
Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Architect of Unity.''
   The local newspaper featured a spread about Genscher's childhood
in the city he left behind when he fled his Communist homeland for
West Germany nearly 40 years ago.
   ``Genscher was the man who made all these developments toward
German unity possible,'' said Albrecht Klemenz, a 37-year-old
physicist in Halle. ``He worked for years to win trust and improve
relations between the two blocs, and that was an important
precondition.''
   For several years, officials in Washington and London used the
term ``Genscherism'' to describe what they saw as an attitude of
excessive confidence in Moscow.
   Now, Germans invoke the same term proudly to sum up their
country's achievements as a visionary force in European diplomacy.
   Perhaps Genscher's first major victory came in September. After
weeks of frantic efforts, he appeared on the balcony of the West
German Embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and told thousands of
East Germans they could leave for West Germany.
   The roar of approval touched the usually calm politician, who
has served as foreign minister since 1974.
   ``That was the most moving point of my political career,''
Genscher told reporters outside the embassy compound.
   In his speech Friday, Genscher called for immediate recognition
of Poland's present borders. This would ease Polish worries about
losing to a united Germany land it gained from Germany after World
War II, and it would remove an obstacle to reunification.
   ``Both German states can make an important contribution to
stability in Europe after the March 18 (East German) election by
saying, `We Germans do not have territorial claims on any one of
our neighbors, also not on the Polish people,''' he told the
cheering crowd. Many spectators carried West German flags.
   ``This peaceful revolution in East Germany has brought honor to
our entire German nation. I am proud of Halle on the Salle!'' he
said, visibly moved. Halle lies on the Salle river in Saxony in the
southwestern part of East Germany.
   At the end of the speech, the crowd mobbed Genscher, shouting
``Hans-Dietrich!'' along with the now-familiar ``Germany United
Fatherland!''
   Genscher was born in the nearby suburb of Reideburg, and his
parents later moved to Halle itself. He returned to the
Soviet-occupied sector of his homeland after he was captured by the
Americans and imprisoned in Britain until the end of World War II.
   The local newspaper Freiheit mentions a cousin in the suburb of
Liskau as possibly the only immediate Genscher relative left in the
area.
   Freiheit featured an interview with that cousin, Werner Ruehl,
in its Friday edition.
   ``We haven't lost contact since 1952,'' the newspaper quoted
Ruehl as saying, referring to the year Genscher escaped to the West
after growing disenchanted with the Communist state. ``He visits us
every year, usually around Christmas.''
   Genscher has long been troubled by health problems, including
heart trouble and a bout of tuberculosis in the 1950s.

<TEXT>
   When the Census Bureau sets out to count
Americans in a few weeks, workers will have all new maps _ the
result of a massive cartographic cooperation by government agencies.
   The project was undertaken because it's not enough for the
census to just count everyone every 10 years. It also has to report
where they are.
   Since 1983 the U.S. Geological Survey and the Census Bureau have
worked together to compile a new set of computerized maps, known as
TIGER for Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
Referencing.
   Census-takers for years were plagued by old and inaccurate maps,
sometimes setting forth with nothing more detailed than highway
department road maps.
   ``Highway department maps typically only show the roads they
maintain, which are not all roads. Often they are very deficient
for census purposes, but they were the best available,'' explained
Robert Marx, chief of the Census Bureau's geography division.
   Now all that has changed.
   ``The Tiger system allows us to tailor maps to the enumerator.
If you are working in downtown New York City you need a different
type of map than if you are working in rural Kansas,'' observed
Marx. ``And crew leaders need different maps from their workers.''
   Tiger maps are stored on computer tape, making it easy to change
them and to run new copies as needed.
   Copies of the new local census maps have been sent to more than
39,000 local governments across the nation in recent months, with
preliminary housing counts going to 21,000 local governments, Marx
explained.
   Officials were asked to check the maps and make additions or
corrections, which then are entered in the computers for use in the
April 1 census.
   ``On the housing counts, we have heard from about 13 percent of
the 21,000 governments,'' he said.
   ``Comments ranged from `it looks fine' to some fairly serious
problems. Where we have identified problems we are recanvassing the
area to find out what happened and to get it fixed,'' Marx said.
   This local review will be repeated after the census. The maps
will be sent out again, along with the housing unit and population
counts by block.
   Local governments then will be able to check for omissions and
census officials will recanvass areas where questions are raised.
   The 497,000 Tiger maps are at a variety of scales, with a map
inch equaling from one-twelfth to one-third of a mile on land _
large enough for workers to list every house and make small
notations about them.
   Included on the maps are roads, railroads, rivers and government
boundaries, as well as postal ZIP code areas, census blocks and
tracts.
   This allows the bureau to pinpoint every household location to
be sent a census form or visited, to make sure the residents are
counted.
   The four-year effort to compile the maps cost $300 million and
was based on the Geological Survey's topographic maps of the
nation. Those maps were converted to computer form, and then about
1,200 workers added the political boundaries, streets, highways and
houses.
   The workers added 63,000 area names, 45,000 census tract
numbers, 300,000 enumeration district numbers and 2.5 million block
numbers.
   The final maps will be released for government, business or
public use, and they are expected to be helpful in routing police
and rescue vehicles and in land management. In addition, the
computer files will be sold to private firms.

<HEAD>Bush Proposes Down Payments for VA Home Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's proposal to start
requiring veterans to make down payments on home loans uses a
forecast that a top veterans' affairs official acknowledges is too
pessimistic.
   The administration, in its 1991 budget proposal, said it wants
VA loan borrowers to make a 4 percent down payment on loans over
$25,000. Currently, the VA loan program is distinguished from other
mortgage programs by the lack of a required down payment.
   The administration also proposes raising from 1.25 percent to
1.75 percent a loan-making fee that took effect in January. And, it
wants to limit the number of veterans who can gain exemption from
the fee because of service-connected disabilities.
   The Department of Veterans' Affairs says the changes are needed
to keep the program afloat in the face of rising losses due to
foreclosures. Officials attribute the foreclosure problem to
national and regional recessions in the past decade.
   But the administration's fiscal 1991 budget relies on more
optimistic economic assumptions.
   According to the Bush economic projections, personal income is
supposed to rise more than one-third over 1988 levels by 1995,
while wages and salaries are supposed to rise by more than
one-half. Unemployment, the forecast says, likely will stabilize at
5 percent of the labor force.
   The VA based its fee-raising proposals on a projection of likely
future foreclosure rates of 10 percent to 11 percent over 10 years,
said Bill Lutes, assistant director for program management in the
VA's loan guaranty service.
   He said that figure represents a balance between the relatively
low foreclosure rates of the 1970s and the double-digit rates of
the '80s.
   But during a hearing last April before the House Veterans'
Affairs subcommittee on housing, Keith Pedigo, director of the VA
loan guaranty program, acknowledged the 11 percent projection was
too high.
   ``My personal opinion is that the actual foreclosure rate will
be somewhat less than 11 percent,'' Pedigo said under questioning
by the subcommittee chairman, Democrat Harley O. Staggers Jr. of
West Virginia.
   ``I think the range of 7 (percent) to 8 percent is probably more
realistic than 11 percent,'' said Pedigo.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office used a rate of 7
percent over 10 years, or 8.03 percent over the 30-year life of the
mortgage.
   Pedigo, in a recent interview, conceded that the 11 percent
figure ``would be on the high side.'' But he maintained the
projection was, nevertheless, ``within the reasonable range.''
   And he insisted that the generally rosy economic projection
underlying the overall Bush budget proposal does not apply to the
loan program.
   Some congressmen involved in veterans' issues argue that the
administration put the new loan proposal together too hastily. They
say it ignores a separate effort by lawmakers to reinvigorate the
VA program.
   ``The proposals appear to be a broad attack by the president and
the Office of Management and Budget on a 46-year-old program to
which Congress overwhelmingly recommitted itself just three months
ago,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of the Senate
Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Critics of the administration proposal, both in and out of
Congress, as well as various government audits, say the VA must
bear much of the blame for losses because of insufficient staffing
and poor management.
   They also complain that the VA for too long has succumbed to the
temptation to unload VA loan portfolios at fire-sale prices, for
quick cash fixes, rather than waiting for the loans to mature.
   The money raised by the higher loan origination fee would go to
the Mortgage Guaranty and Indemnity Fund, which was created in
January.
   Congress said the trust fund would protect the lender, borrower
and government from losses on bad loans and would sustain itself
through the decade.
   But VA officials, during a Jan. 29 budget briefing, disagreed
with Congress on how well the fund would work. They presented a
chart showing the fund would be $193 million in the red by 1995
unless a down payment were required and the loan origination fee
raised.
   Congress and the VA are at odds on the prospects for the fund's
success because they disagree on the severity of the foreclosure
problem.
   An earlier fund that relied on a 1 percent fee was set up
differently and made no effort to be self-sufficient. As a result,
$2.4 billion in home-loan losses have been swallowed by the
Treasury since 1984.

<TEXT>
   For a decade, Congress has grappled with U.S.
policy toward El Salvador and spent some $4 billion supporting its
government in a civil war with leftist rebels.
   About 70,000 people have died, victims of the fighting, of
left-wing assassins or of right-wing death squads. And for all the
aid, critics of the U.S. policy say the United States has bought
little or nothing.
   Now, Congress is gearing up for yet another debate over El
Salvador as it considers President Bush's request for a total of
$375 million in aid for the year that begins Oct. 1.
   As usual, the battle comes against a backdrop of right-wing
murders, amid protests over the U.S. stance and with warnings that
any signal of wavering support could throw the country into even
worse chaos.
   But this time there are new elements. For the first time in the
history of the country's civil war, an Army colonel and seven
others have been charged with death-squad-style murders in
connection with the killing of six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter.
   Whether the country's rickety judicial system _ and President
Alfredo Cristiani, whose government brought the charges _ can stand
the strain of a trial scheduled for May remains unclear. But few on
Capitol Hill are talking seriously about a wholesale slash in aid
while the government attempts to bring the killers to justice.
   Another new element is a proposal by Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., that seeks for the first time to give the United States
some leverage over the behavior of the leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   For years, U.S. conservatives have pointed at the FMLN, largely
armed with Soviet-bloc weapons, as the evildoers in El Salvador.
Emotions have been high as they berated the left for what they said
was placing the primary burden of finding peace on the government,
now dominated by Cristiani's right-wing Arena party.
   The standard response has been that the U.S. aid _ and therefore
U.S. influence _ extends only to the country's government. Efforts
on the other side of the equation have been largely limited to
asking the Soviets to stop sending arms.
   Dodd's proposal seeks to rewrite the equation by cutting U.S.
military aid in half.
   If the San Salvador government fails to go along with United
Nations-sponsored peace negotiations, it would lose the other half
of the aid; if the FMLN walks away from the talks or mounts a major
military offensive like its attack on the capital last November,
the military aid to the government would be restored to its full
level.
   ``I believe this formula tests the goodwill on both sides to
pursue an equitable and just political settlement and offers the
best chance for achieving that result,'' Dodd said when he
introduced the idea 10 days ago.
   The proposal's appeal for lawmakers likely will be that it
represents a middle ground between the administration's
full-speed-ahead approach and the effort by a handful of liberal
senators to cut aid off entirely. And for the first time, it would
apply limited U.S. pressure on both sides to reach an agreement,
rather than putting the burden totally on one side or the other.
   Members of Congress have come under heavy pressure, particularly
from church groups, to curtail Salvadoran aid. Last week, a group
of activists in the Spokane, Wash., district of House Speaker
Thomas Foley won a commitment from him to study the Dodd proposal.
   Much still depends on events in El Salvador over the coming
months, including whether all sides can be satisfied that the
killers of the priests are identified and punished, and progress is
made toward bolstering the judicial system and the pursuit of peace.
   ``If they don't do those things ... then they're in serious
trouble on their aid package,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich.
``Salvador has to understand that there's lots of demand for the
aid pie right now. They've clearly got to understand that there are
competing interests.''

<HEAD>Bush Says Reunified Germany Must be Part of NATO</HEAD>

   President Bush still is insisting
that a reunified Germany be part of the NATO alliance, as two top
western leaders speculate the Soviets will drop their objections to
such a move.
   ``There will be a lot of discussions before now and the event,''
Bush said Sunday when asked by reporters about newly voiced Soviet
reservations regarding a unified Germany joining NATO.
   ``We have our position supporting (West German) Chancellor
(Helmut) Kohl. We know what Kohl's position is. We're just going to
stay with it,'' Bush said during a beach outing near his vacation
home.
   Kohl contends that if East and West Germany reunite, the country
should be in NATO, although he does not advocate NATO troops in
East Germany.
   On Saturday, top Soviet official Valentin Falin said that if the
Western alliance insists on a unified Germany joining NATO, ``then
there won't be any German unification.''
   The Soviet position appears to be hardening against NATO
membership for the two Germanies as talks on reunification get
underway among East and West Germany and the powers that divided
them: the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union.
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III and NATO Secretary
Manfred Woerner both said Sunday they do not believe the Soviet
objections are final.
   ``We're going to have to see the degree to which they really
feel that way,'' Baker said on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley'' program. ``For myself, I would tell you that I'm not so
sure that they really strongly feel that way.''
   ``I think, without putting words in the mouths of the Soviets,
that they see the stability that is afforded by the continued
presence of United States forces in Europe,'' he said.
   Woerner, interviewed on the same television program, said he
believes the Soviets will change their minds ``under one condition:
that we give them a clear guarantee this is not turning against
them.''
   Woerner contended the Soviets are engaged in ``a tactical play''
and that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hasn't staked out a
firm position on the matter of German alignment.
   ``If they really think their own legitimate security interests
through, it will be better for them to have a Germany which is in a
stable condition and is firmly embedded in safety and security
structures, than to have a neutral Germany floating around trying
to form alliances,'' Woerner said.
   Both Baker and Horst Teltschik, foreign policy adviser to Kohl,
predicted Sunday that unification of Germany will take place by
year's end.
   ``Unification is taking place as we sit here this morning, on
the ground, economically,'' Baker said.
   Bush also said Sunday that he wants to invite Gorbachev to join
him for a visit to his seaside vacation home when the Soviet leader
comes to the United States for a summit meeting this spring.
   Bush said he wants to host Gorbachev in Kennebunkport ``If we
can do it.''
   ``I think he'd enjoy it,'' the president told reporters as he
and his wife Barbara took a fast-paced ``power walk'' on the beach
in subfreezing temperatures.
   Bush said, however, he has not yet invited Gorbachev to Maine.
   The president already has had three heads of state to his
Walker's Point home: French Prime Minister Francois Mitterrand,
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Danish Prime Minister
Poul Schluter.
   The Bushes today were concluding a three-day holiday weekend at
their home on Walker's Point.

<HEAD>Military Appeals Court Overturns Marine's Conviction on Lesbianism
Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military appeals court cites bias among
members of a court martial jury in overturning a Marine corporal's
conviction for having sex with another woman, court documents show.
   Barbara J. Baum, who served 226 days in the brig in 1988, said
this weekend she had expected to be exonerated ``because I knew it
was unfair from the start and I'd said all along it wasn't all
over.''
   The Court of Military Review in Washington ruled on Thursday
that two of the officers serving on the jury at Baum's court
martial were biased and that the military judge allowed
uncorroborated testimony.
   ``I think that her trial was flawed in a number of respects and
I am glad that they recognized the errors that they did,'' said
Susan Masling, an attorney with the Washington law firm of Arnold
and Porter, which represented Baum at no charge.
   ``They technically are free to retry her at another court
martial. However, as we understand the law, she would not be able
to serve any more time in the brig, so the only thing they could
get out of another court martial _ besides a lot of bad publicity _
is perhaps getting her a bad conduct discharge,'' Masling said.
   But Lt. Col. Ron Stokes, a Marine spokesman, said last week that
no decision had been made yet on a new trial.
   The appellate court declined to rule on several other arguments
raised in the appeal, including that it is unconstitutional to
selectively prosecute and punish homosexuals for sodomy while
heterosexuals are not punished for the same actions.
   Baum said she will continue to fight to force the government to
pay the $14,000 bill from her first lawyer. Although she was not
paid during the time she spent in the brig, she has not sought to
recover back pay.
   Baum, 25, is originally from Mishawaka, Ind., but now lives in
Lakewood, Fla.
   According to court papers, the three-judge military appeals
panel last week found that two jurors _ identified only as Sgt.
Major Moore and Col. Nunnally _ were not impartial.
   Moore had attended Baum's so-called Article 32 investigation,
which is akin to a grand jury, and had listened to the government's
key witness.
   ``Sergeant Major Moore's statement that he attended appellant's
Article 32 investigation, moreover, suggested that he had some
interest in the outcome of the case,'' the judges wrote. ``The
military judge failed to ask him why he attended the hearing,
thereby leaving his reasons open to speculation.''
   Nunnally revealed during the early stages of Baum's trial that
he had discussed the investigation of lesbian activities at Parris
Island with a Navy investigator.
   ``Colonel Nunnally appears to have extrajudicial knowledge of
the evidence and an interest in the outcome of the litigation,''
the judges wrote.
   Baum was the first of five women charged in a crackdown in 1988
on alleged lesbians at the Marine Corps' Parris Island, S.C.,
Recruit Depot.
   The Defense Department's official policy states that
``homosexuality is incompatible with military service. The presence
in the military of persons who engage in homosexual conduct ...
seriously impairs the accomplishment of the military mission.''
   Baum had been charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice,
sodomy, indecent acts, obstruction of justice and communicating a
threat.
   The woman with whom she allegedly had sex _ Lance Cpl. Diana
Maldonado _ testified against Baum at the court martial. But the
appeals panel found the lack of independent corroboration rendered
Maldonado's testimony ``insufficient as a matter of law.''
   Baum was convicted in June 1988, sentenced to a year in prison
and a dishonorable discharge. But five months later, her commanding
officer, Maj. Gen. Jarvis D. Lynch, granted Baum clemency. She was
freed after serving 226 days in the brig at Quantico, Va.
   Her dishonorable discharge was upgraded to a bad conduct
discharge but Lynch left intact portions of Baum's sentence that
reduced her rank to private and required her to forfeit all pay and
allowances.

<HEAD>Aides Travel to Florida to Discuss Barry Treatment Options</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry and his advisers are
planning the next step in his treatment for substance abuse, with
the only certainty being that he will not remain at the Florida
rehabilitation clinic he entered following his arrest on a drug
charge.
   Barry, who was indicted last week on perjury and cocaine
charges, was visited in Florida on Sunday by top aides to discuss
options for a new treatment facility, according to top government
officials and the mayor's political advisers.
   Barry was scheduled to complete a 28-day treatment cycle for
alcoholism at the Hanley-Hazelden Clinic in West Palm Beach, Fla.,
today and leave the facility on Wednesday, officials said. His
impending plans have not been formalized, they said.
   City Administrator Carol B. Thompson and the mayor's chief of
staff, Maudine Cooper, arrived at the clinic Sunday to weigh
treatment options, the sources said, although Thompson and Cooper
said they were in Florida only to discuss routine legislative
matters.
   However, they said an announcement on Barry's treatment would be
made this week. Mayoral aides said last week that a top priority
would be to enroll Barry in a more secluded treatment facility.
   Barry's wife, Effie, also was expected to participate in the
treatment discussion, said government officials and Barry advisers.
   The mayor entered Hanley-Hazelden on Jan. 22, four days after he
was arrested on a cocaine possession charge in an FBI sting
operation.
   Barry may enter the Betty Ford Clinic in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,
according to a top adviser. Barry expressed a desire to enter the
Ford clinic during the weekend following his arrest, but settled on
Hanley-Hazelden when no spaces were available, according to sources.
   Barry is scheduled to appear in federal court Wednesday to
answer an eight-count drug and perjury indictment handed up last
Thursday, although District of Columbia Corporation Counsel Herbert
O. Reid said the mayor is unlikely to appear.
   ``It's my understanding that Ken (R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's
personal attorney) has determined that the mayor himself need not
appear,'' Reid said. ``Mundy can answer those charges for him.''
   Attempts to reach Mundy by telephone were unsuccessful. Judy
Smith, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens, said last
week that federal officials believe Barry must answer the charges
in person.
   Mundy has said the mayor will plead innocent to all eight
charges.
   Barry sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
were uncertain whether the mayor will return to the nation's
capital this week or go directly to a new treatment facility.
   At least one political adviser has cautioned the mayor against
returning yet.
   ``He's got a good chance to lick this thing, both the charges
and the addiction, but he needs to demonstrate that he's serious
about it,'' said the source, who spoke on the condition his name
not be used. ``He can do that by going right back into treatment,
and if he stays away from here, he can avoid being besieged by the
media.''
   Since entering the Florida facility, Barry has been in daily
telephone contact with either Thompson, who is handling the
day-to-day operation of the government, or Cooper.
   In addition, Cooper has made at least two trips to Florida
carrying bills and government documents that required the mayor's
signature.
   Barry has been charged with three counts of lying to a grand
jury about his drug involvement and five counts of cocaine
possession. The perjury counts, all of which are felonies, each
carry a penalty of five years in prison and a maximum fine of
$250,000. Barry also faces a maximum of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine for each misdemeanor possession charge.
   A perjury conviction would require Barry to resign and bar him
from holding elected office again.
   The perjury indictments and four of the five possession charges
stem from a 14-month probe into Barry's ties to a convicted drug
dealer. The fifth possession charge is the result of Barry's Jan.
18 arrest at a downtown Washington hotel while visiting a longtime
woman companion.

   The marital woes of billionaire Donald Trump and
his wife, Ivana, have reached ``the highest echelons of
mega-boredom,'' and a media recess is in order, the Boring
Institute says.
   ``Why does the public have to be subjected to the same overkill
of rumor, innuendo and occasionally factual information that we
suffered through in 1989 with Roseanne Barr?'' Alan Caruba, founder
of the tongue-in-cheek, Maplewood, N.J.-based institute, said
Sunday.
   Caruba would like to see a media recess in which ``nothing is
said or written about the Trumps for at least a week, allowing for
some minimal sanity to return to the newsrooms of America.''
   The Trumps began making headlines Feb. 11 when the Daily News
reported Trump was leaving his wife. Reports that a prenuptial
agreement would give Ivana $25 million, a Connecticut mansion and
custody of their three children became the talk of the town in New
York.

   Former Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci says she
did not live ``the good life'' in Romania, and denies she was the
mistress of Nicu Ceausescu, son of the executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Comaneci, who won glory for her country when she scored perfect
10s in the Montreal Olympics in 1976, also said in the March issue
of Life magazine that her defection from Romania may have helped
start the revolution there.
   She said her escape to the West in November hit her homeland
``like a bomb. A bomb for the government. Because what will the
people think? That even Nadia leaves Romania.
   ``They thought I had the good life, but I didn't. I lived just
like the others.''
   About a month after Comaneci left, Romania's communist
government was overthrown and the elder Ceausescu was executed.
   Comaneci dismissed as ``lies'' reports that she was the mistress
of Nicu Ceausescu.
   ``I am the famous one. So when people see Nicu and see me, they
think we are lovers only because they know me. All lies.''
   She and Constantin Panait, a 36-year-old roofer who helped plan
her escape, live temporarily in a one-bedroom apartment in Los
Angeles.
   Comaneci said she and Panait, who has a wife in Hallandale,
Fla., have no plans to marry.

   Eugene Fodor Jr., the gifted, flamboyant violinist
arrested last July for possessing cocaine and heroin, says his
image as the ``cowboy violinist'' kept him from receiving critical
international acclaim.
   ``I think what went wrong was the advice I got from my first
manager and the insistence of the PR firm he hired that they
promote this image of me as an outdoorsman,'' Fodor said during a
recent interview. ``I mean, sure I was from the West, but they even
said I looked like Mick Jagger.''
   Fodor, 39, said he experimented with drugs over the years and
had started using cocaine heavily before he was arrested last July
at a motel on Martha's Vineyard, a resort island south of Cape Cod
in Massachusetts. He was charged with breaking and entering and
possession of cocaine, heroin and a hypodermic needle.
   He was sentenced to three years' probation under which he is
subject to random drug testing.
   The violin virtuoso is scheduled to appear next weekend with the
Colorado Symphony Orchestra at Boettcher Hall.

   Comedian Bob Hope's 195-acre ranch soon will
be sprouting dozens of luxury homes, says the real-estate developer
who paid the comedian $10 million for the property.
   The ranch, once the home of sheep, cattle and horses, was sold
to Continental Communities in a deal that closed about a week ago,
said Robert E. Zuckerman, the company's president. It is one of
only a few large tracts of open land still left in the city's
sprawling San Fernando Valley.
   ``We found out about this property through one of his associates
and we were very excited to get our check to Mr. Hope before
anybody else,'' Zuckerman said. ``We paid exactly what he wanted,
which is the way he likes to do business.''
   Zuckerman said his company plans to build 75 homes priced at
$1.5 million each, as well as an office building and a shopping
center on the property about 30 miles northwest of downtown.
   The 86-year-old Hope, who has been rehearsing for a forthcoming
NBC-TV special, was not available for comment, his publicist, Frank
Liberman, said Saturday.

   ``Nuclear power is too powerful. It's not safe,'' said Begley.
``We have to look at the facts. We have a responsibility to

   US Ecology Inc., developer of the $40 million concrete vault

   The compact includes Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.

   Addressing the largest anti-government
crowd since the Sandinistas came to power, the leading opposition
presidential candidate promised Nicaragua would have more teachers
than soldiers if she is victorious next Sunday.
   ``The vote of the people is going to knock down the wall of
shame, as the German people did with the Berlin Wall,'' Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro told 60,000 cheering supporters Sunday in the
capital's main square, the Plaza of the Revolution.
   Mrs. Chamorro is the main challenger of President Daniel Ortega
for a six-year term in an election widely considered to be a
referendum on the Sandinistas' 10-year rule.
   Sunday's was the final election rally for the United National
Opposition, a coalition of 14 parties and one native Indian
organization.
   The coalition is expected to continue media appeals for votes
until Wednesday, when campaigning officially ends and the leftist
Sandinistas hold their last rally.
   Some people said they stayed away from Sunday's rally because
they had no way to get there or feared trouble. There was virtually
no public transportation in the city Sunday morning.
   One man said authorities delayed his group, coming from the
provinces.
   ``They (police) stopped our caravan outside Masaya,'' a town 30
minutes from Managua, said the man, who would only give his first
name, Santos. ``They kept us there for a long time, and people were
getting angry. They finally let us go, but one truck at a time,
very slowly.''
   The United National Opposition, known as UNO, also complained
that officials refused to allow in a sound system rented in
neighboring Costa Rica.
   Police in riot gear had patrolled Managua streets since Saturday
and police jeeps with tear gas grenade-launchers were lined up on
streets.
   Mrs. Chamorro reiterated her pledge to end the draft, rebuild
the economy and reduce the size of the 150,000-member armed forces,
the largest in Central America. The country's soldiers would be be
trained for civilian jobs and none would be left unemployed, she
said.
   ``I will not allow a soldier to be made of each child,'' she
said to wild cheers, referring to the obligatory two-year military
service for all boys age 16. ``Our democracy will have more
teachers than soldiers, and many more schools than barracks.
   ``And to my dear friends in Central America, I assure them that
with the internal peace of Nicaragua, Central America also will
have peace,'' she said. ``Our democracy will have more teachers
than soldiers, and many more schools than barracks.''
   The Sandinistas have been fighting the U.S.-backed Contra
insurgency since about two years after they came to power in the
revolution that overthrew late strongman Anastasio Somoza in July
1979.
   About 1.7 million Nicaraguans, nearly half of the population of
3.8 million, have registered to vote in Sunday's election for
president and vice president, National Assembly, 144 municipal
councils and two regional councils.
   Mrs. Chamorro is the widow of Pedro Joaquin Chamorro, a
publisher and outspoken critic of the Somoza dictatorship whose
assassination in January 1978 broadened support for the Sandinista
revolution.
   Her right leg still in a cast because of a fractured knee, Mrs.
Chamorro spoke from a raised stage while sitting in a wheelchair
next to her running mate, Virgilio Godoy.
   Godoy spoke of 200,000 people at the rally but international
observers and journalists agreed on the estimate of 60,000.
   He appealed to women voters, saying they make up 54 percent of
registered voters: ``In the hands of the Nicaraguan woman ... is
the future of the republic, and we know they won't leave it in this
mess.''
   Mrs. Chamorro urged voters to go home and avoid incidents after
casting ballots on Sunday. The comment was interpreted as a reply
to Sandinista accusations that her coalition is planning election
day violence.
   About 1,000 international observers are in the country for the
balloting.

   Soviet tenor Vladimir Popov took his bows
after a Verdi opera at the Kennedy Center and then played the
leading role in a backstage drama when he received his U.S.
citizenship papers from Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
   ``This is the greatest day in my life,'' declared Popov moments
after the curtain fell on his performance Saturday night, as he
fell to his knees and crossed himself. ``I'm a little bit nervous.''
   Popov, 42, the son of a retired Soviet army general, defected in
1982 in Milan, Italy, while on leave from the Bolshoi Opera to
study Italian repertoire at La Scala.
   On Saturday night, Popov sang with prima donna Aprile Millo in
the Washington Opera's first production of the Giuseppe Verdi
spectacular, ``Aida,'' before a sold-out audience in the Kennedy
Center Opera House.
   Afterward, Popov joined his American-born wife, Lucy, backstage
for a celebration with a small circle of friends and well-wishers.
   Still wearing the heavy makeup and glittering robes of the
opera's Egyptian war hero, Radames, the stocky tenor was greeted by
a black-robed Scalia, the son of a Sicilian immigrant and a
self-confessed opera lover.
   ``I am delighted to welcome you to the land of the free and the
home of the brave,'' said Scalia, who gave the singer his
citizenship papers encased in a red-framed album with ``Vladimir
Popov'' printed in gold letters on the black leather cover.

<HEAD>Bennett: Some Type of `Death Penalty' for Bankers Who Launder Drug</HEAD>

</TEXT>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William Bennett says he
favors ``something analogous'' to the death penalty for high-level
bankers who launder drug money.
   Bennett has expressed support for the death penalty for
convicted drug kingpins. In an appearance Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet
the Press'' program, he said bankers who knowingly handle drug cash
should be treated similarly.
   ``If we're talking about capital punishment for people who are
high-level drug dealers, we ought to be talking about something
analogous for the high-level banker who trades in drug cash,'' said
Bennett.
   President Bush's proposed drug control strategy calls for
expanding the circumstances under which convicted drug kingpins
could face the death penalty.
   Bennett's comment came during questioning about a case in which
the Luxembourg-based Bank of Credit and Commerce International
pleaded guilty in January to cocaine-related money-laundering
charges and agreed to forfeit $14 million and to help prosecutors
who say the case has ties to deposed Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Bennett indicated he was concerned that the sentence was light
and said he raised that concern with Bush ``and he agreed.''
   The bank remains in business. Bennett said the case is part of
an ongoing investigation and that he and other officials will
continue to monitor it.

<HEAD>Administration Budget Would Revive 1980s Waste, Dingell Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee says the Bush administration's fiscal 1991 budget would
repeat wasteful mistakes of the previous decade by rushing weapon
systems into production without enough testing.
   ``When we look at our military procurement strategy, it still
reflects the thinking of the early 1980s,'' Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., said in a Feb. 9 letter to President Bush made public
Sunday.
   Dingell said $10 billion to $20 billion could be trimmed from
Bush's proposed $292 billion defense budget by delaying the
purchase of weapons in need of further research and testing,
including a Navy attack submarine and destroyer and the Air Force's
B-2 bomber.
   Pentagon spokeswoman Chris Cimko and White House spokesman Doug
Davidson both said they could not comment.
   As the United States underwent its biggest military buildup
since World War II in the early 1980s, the Pentagon's weapon
acquisition policy ``was geared toward getting major weapons
systems produced and fielded today, not tomorrow,'' Dingell wrote.
   ``The primary method for expediting these procurements was to
rush the systems into production prior to the completion of design,
engineering and testing. This process of concurrency, or buy before
you fly, has resulted in untold waste.''
   In the worst case, the Reagan administration contracted to buy
100 B1-B bombers for more than $20 billion before the plane was
properly tested and evaluated, Dingell said.

   When the Contra chief of staff
learned a top comandante was going to lay down his arms and return
to Nicaragua for the elections, he assembled the troops.
   The message Israel Galeano had for the fighters of the Quilali
Battalion on the day after Christmas at their Honduran base camp
was blunt and unforgiving.
   Luis Adan Fley, he said, was a traitor.
   ``If I return, he'll have me shot,'' said Fley. ``This is what
he said to the troops of the Quilali.''
   Under Central American peace accords, the ruling Sandinistas in
Nicaragua offered amnesty to all members of the U.S.-supported
Contra rebel force, which has been fighting to overthrow the
leftist government.
   Fley became the only active rebel commander to accept amnesty
and return home before the electoral hand plays out Sunday.
   Why did the man best known by his nom de guerre, Comandante
Johnson, defy the rebel high command and leave his comrades-in-arms
after eight hard years?
   ``There are two groups inside the resistance: those fighting for
power and those fighting for the democratization of Nicaragua,''
Fley said. ``If I'd been fighting for power, I would have stayed.''
   Fley said he came home because he believes the new Nicaraguan
battleground is _ finally _ the ballot box. The time has arrived,
he said, for ``the people to decide with their vote'' what kind of
government they want.
   ``The armed struggle has borne its fruit,'' he said last week
during a campaign rally in Matagalpa, his hometown 60 miles
northeast of Managua, for the 14-party opposition alliance trying
to unseat the ruling Sandinistas.
   ``The Sandinistas have embarked upon a process of
democratization and to elections. The armed struggle isn't
justified anymore. It would only be justified if the Sandinistas
committed fraud or refused to hand over power,'' he said.
   With more than 1,000 international observers, Fley thinks the
possibility of fraud is ``remote'' and he is convinced the
Sandinistas will lose.
   ``I don't have any doubt. I've been all over Nicaragua and I am
sure UNO (the United National Opposition) will win by a 3-1
margin,'' he said.
   The UNO slate is led by publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
President Daniel Ortega's principal opponent.
   If Fley is wrong and the Sandinistas win, the Contra veteran
insists he is ready to recognize an honest Sandinista victory and
remain in Nicaragua as part of the peaceful opposition.
   ``I've been influenced by the changes in Europe. Systems have
been changed without a shot being fired,'' he said. ``Why can't we
do this?
   ``We're a backward country; we resolve all our problems with
bullets and with killing anyone who thinks differently. We have to
evolve and imitate these (European) countries,'' he said.
   Fley, 39, said he doesn't believe the Sandinistas, if
victorious, will risk international condemnation by stifling the
peaceful opposition.
   ``They can't begin jailing all their opponents, sending them
into exile and killing them,'' he said. ``They have a lot of
credibility problems abroad and economic problems. They need the
opposition to have a credible government.''
   Sandinista leaders have made it clear they expect clean
elections to bring improved relations with the United States and
substantial international help in rebuilding an economy shattered
by war, U.S. economic embargo and mismanagement.
   Fley, who was running the Contra office in Tegucigalpa, the
Honduran capital, said he began negotiating his return a few days
before Christmas. He agreed to renounce the armed struggle in
exchange for government guarantees that he would not be
``investigated, detained, persecuted or drafted into the military.''
   Although Fley's decision to return is unique among the senior
rebel commanders, it illustrates the hopes raised by the election
as well as the deep gulfs that must still be bridged before there
can be national reconciliation.
   Two brothers, both officers in the Sandinista army, were on hand
to greet Fley when he returned Jan. 8 along with eight
lower-ranking Contras. A third brother had died in a rebel ambush
in 1987.
   Fley and his 32-year-old brother Francisco had fought together
with the Sandinistas in the 1979 revolution that ousted the Somoza
family dictatorship.
   They had last seen each other in October 1988. Francisco, now a
captain, was leading a mission charged with persuading Fley to
commit 1,200 rebel troops to a cease-fire in Matagalpa province.
   But Fley, deeply suspicious of the Sandinistas, instead took his
brother prisoner to embarrass the army. They spent eight days
together in the hills, trying to persuade each other to stop
fighting.
   Neither budged.
   Although Fley has come home believing Nicaragua is on the road
to democracy, much remains the same. He has talked with Franciso
and with his other brother Jorge, a lieutenant, only briefly since
his return.
   ``It's always the same rhetoric that their chiefs say. They
never say anything else,'' Fley said.
   Jorge, 29, agreed there has been no political rapprochement
among the brothers. But he still believes his elder brother's
return offers hope for peace and reconciliation.
   ``I think Luis has taken an important step,'' Jorge said. ``He
is well known among the Contras; he commanded a lot of men. It's a
step toward peace in Nicaragua.''

<HEAD>Survey: Typical American Adult Has Sex Once a Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to bedroom habits, Americans
are a rather staid lot, a new survey concludes.
   On average, adults say they have sex once a week. If they are
married, it's almost invariably with their spouse. And they
overwhelmingly eschew homosexuality.
   ``This shows that the sexual behavior of Americans is more
circumspect and traditional than the libertine impression we get
from the popular media and fiction,'' said Tom W. Smith of the
University of Chicago, who directed the survey.
   A separate study shows that teen-age boys, as well, are not
living up to their reputations.
   It found that adolescents seem to be having sex less often, with
fewer girls and at a later age than teen-agers did a decade ago.
   ``This contrasts sharply with the view that most young men are
sexually promiscuous,'' said Fredya L. Sonenstein of the Urban
Institute in Washington, who analyzed the results.
   Both reports were among sex surveys outlined Sunday at a meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
   The University of Chicago results were based on interviews and
questionnaires administered to a cross-section of 1,500 adults in
1988 and 1989. The questions were added to the General Social
Survey, which has been conducted annually since 1972.
   Surprisingly little is known about the sex lives of ordinary
Americans, Smith said.
   His survey found that on average, adults have sex 57 times a
year, or about once a week.
   ``We don't know what night of the week,'' he said, ``but it
sounds like the traditional stereotype of every Saturday night.''
   Sexual frequency dropped with age from about 78 times a year for
those under 40 to eight times for those over 70. Overall, married
people have sex 67 times a year, separated people 66 times,
divorced and never-married people 55 and widowed people six, the
survey found.
   However, 22 percent of people said they had no sex partners at
all during the previous year. Nine percent of married people were
abstinate, as were 86 percent of widowed people.
   Among other findings:
   _Only 1.5 percent of married people admitted cheating on their
spouses during the previous year.
   _Between 91 percent and 93 percent of people have been
exclusively heterosexual during their adult lives. Five percent to
6 percent have been bisexual, and less than 1 percent are
exclusively homosexual. About 3 percent have never had sex.
   _Married people who say they are the happiest also have the most
sex.
   _Seven percent of adults are at relatively high risk of catching
AIDS because they have multiple sex partners, they have sex with
strangers or they are homosexual.
   Smith said some people probably lied about their sex habits,
especially unmarried men, who seemed to inflate the vigor of their
sex lives, and unmarried women, who claimed to experience less sex
than they actually were having. But in general, he said he had
``reasonable confidence'' in the data.
   The survey of adolescent boys was based on interviews with 1,880
people between ages 15 and 19 in 1988. The results were compared
with a similar survey in 1979.
   The boys said they had had six sex partners, compared with seven
a decade earlier. They reported having had sex an average of three
times during the previous month, compared with almost five times in
the earlier survey.
   Condom use has also changed dramatically, apparently out of fear
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Now 57 percent say they
wear condoms, which is more than twice as many as a decade ago.
   The researchers didn't give a margin of error for either survey.

<HEAD>Denver Sierra Clubs Veto Calendar Sales in Dispute over Recycling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Oil Spill-Technology, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of the Sierra Club, which promotes
recycling, say they don't use recycled paper in their lushly
illustrated nature calendars partly because the photographs may not
reproduce well.
   Two Denver-area club branches, calling that stance hypocritical,
have stopped selling the annual fund-raising calendars, and a state
chapter official warns a ``real revolt'' is possible among members
statewide.
   ``As a group, we can't walk one way and talk another way,'' said
Michael Reis, a spokesman for the 1,500-member Enos Mills Group.
``How can we take a hard stand in promoting recycling when our own
group doesn't use recycled paper?''
   The 1,100-member Rachel Carson Group also voted to end sales of
the calendars, which sell for $6.95 and up, and an executive
committee for all Colorado members plans a vote soon on a similar
boycott.
   ``If we don't see any commitment from the national group to
increase their use of recycled paper, we'll see a real revolt,''
said Eugene DeMayo, chairman of the Rocky Mountain regional chapter.
   But Paul Larmer, spokesman at Sierra Club headquarters in San
Francisco, said the organization doesn't have the equipment to do
it right now, and another concern is that slick, glossy color
photographs do not reproduce as well on recycled paper.
   ``We get many, many letters from our members about this issue,
and there is an internal task force looking into the issue right
now,'' he said. ``I think eventually we're going to go all recycled
paper.''
   But ``old habits are hard to break,'' Larmer said.
   Reis said that although the recycled paper produces a slightly
less glossy print, others, including the Denver Water Board _ a
longtime opponent of environmental groups because of its proposed
Two Forks dam _ are doing it.
   ``If the Denver Water Board can do it, why can't the Sierra
Club?'' said Reis.
   A Boulder publisher, Johnson Books, now is producing two
environmental books with recycled paper, and although it is more
expensive, officials say it is worth it.
   ``It looks good and every ton we use saves 17 trees,'' said
publisher Barbara Johnson Mussil.
   The Sierra Club was founded in 1892 by conservationist John Muir
and is a nonprofit national organization dedicated to preserving
wilderness areas and natural parks.
   At least 10,000 of the club's nature calendars are sold in
Colorado each year, and hundreds of thousands are sold nationwide,
Reis said.

   The dollar fell marginally against the Japanese yen
Monday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged as
investor concern quickly shifted from a national election to the
possibility of a rise in a key interest rate.
   The dollar closed at 144.52 yen, down 0.03 yen from Friday's
144.55-yen finish. It opened at 144.28 yen and ranged between
144.10 yen and 144.58 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 237.72 points, or
0.63 percent, closing at 37,222.60. It had lost 11.67 points last
Friday.
   The comfortable majority secured by the governing Liberal
Democratic Party in Sunday's general election failed to boost share
prices ``because the ... victory had been factored into the market
since last week,'' said Yuji Kawakami, an analyst with Nomura
Securities Co.
   The governing party won 275 seats, more than expected, in the
powerful 512-seat lower house of Parliament. Six opposition parties
together secured 237 seats, including 136 won by the Socialist
Party, the largest opposition group.
   Sunday's election was seen as a crucial challenge for the
governing party, which had lost its majority in the less-powerful
upper house in an election last summer, following a series of sex
and money scandals involving Liberal Democrats.
   ``Reassured by the result of the election, investors are already
concerned about a possible discount rate hike, which they speculate
may come at any moment,'' Kawakami said.
   Also pushing the Nikkei down was a decline in Japanese
government bond prices, which resulted from the yen's poor
performance against the dollar, Kawakami said.
   In currency dealings, the yen has not been getting much support
despite expectations for the ruling party's victory and a rise in
the Bank of Japan's official discount rate, dealers said.
   They said the market reacted little to the election results.
   ``Although the market might not have expected the Liberal
Democrats to gain so many seats, the party's majority in the house
has been factored in to the market,'' said Kimio Kobori, a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo.
   He said trading was rather quiet as currency players were
awaiting the release of Japan's money supply figure, scheduled for
Tuesday.
   The money supply figure would be an important indicator for
market players to judge the likelihood of yet another discount rate
rise, Kobori said.
   Following three rises last year, the nation's discount rate now
stands at 4.25 percent.

   A Vietnamese man denied refugee status hanged
himself at his detention center in the first suicide among boat
people in Hong Kong, officials said today.
   Nguyen Van Hai, 28, was found hanging from his belt in a
bathroom at the Whitehead detention center on Friday and taken to a
hospital, where he died Sunday night, officials said.
   Hai's appeal for refugee status had been refused by a government
review board the day before he hanged himself, according to the
Hong Kong office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   The Hong Kong Standard newspaper reported Hai's left a note
saying: ``I am killing myself to protest against the screening
policy of the Hong Kong government, which is too strict and
unfair.''
   Police spokesman Robert Yiu said police did not find a suicide
note.
   He said Hai had told an interpreter at the hospital that he was
dissatisified with the screening system that determines whether
Vietnamese are refugees to be resettled or illegal immigrants
subject to repatriation.
   The approximately 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into this
British colony since June 1988 must prove a fear of persecution in
their Communist homeland or face repatriation.
   The detention centers where they are housed have been
particularly tense since 51 boat people were sent home against
their will in December.
   Four Vietnamese men have stabbed themselves in the abdomen in
protest of the screening policy, but all have survived the wounds.
Yiu said the weekend suicide attempt was the first to succeed.

   After months of preoccupation with domestic
problems as people focused on this week's election, Japan now must
now turn to urgent foreign policy issues in talks with visiting
U.S. defense and trade officials.
   Japan had several months' reprieve from disputes over its $49
billion trade surplus with the United States as leaders prepared
for Sunday's balloting for Parliament's lower house.
   The conservative Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed
Japan since 1955, secured a solid majority of 275 seats in the
512-seat house, promising continuity in foreign policy.
   Talks with U.S. officials on trade in wood products were to
begin today. Talks on informal trade barriers follow later this
week and more talks on trade in satellites and supercomputers are
slated for next week.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who arrives Tuesday for a
five-day visit, is expected to press Tokyo to spend more to support
the 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan.
   U.S. officials charge that Japan isn't doing enough to open its
markets for satellites, telecommunications, supercomputers, forest
products and finance, among others, to foreign goods and services.
   They predict serious trouble with Congress ahead of elections
for the House of Representatives in November if they are unable to
demonstrate substantial progress in shrinking the deficit with
Japan, which accounted for 45 percent of the $108 billion deficit
last year, according to U.S. figures.
   ``Once their elections are behind them, the Japanese must move
immediately to address our concerns before political reaction here
hamstrings our chances for constructive negotiations,'' U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills said in a recent speech.
   Within the next two months, Mrs. Hills must decide whether
Japan's trade practices on lumber, satellites and supercomputers
are unfair and merit retaliation under the so-called Super 301
section of the 1988 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act. So far, she has said,
the outlook is not ``overly optimistic.''
   The negotiations on informal, structural barriers to trade are
more likely to raise mutual expectations than to satisfy
congressional demands for trade concessions, officials on both
sides say.
   In the talks, Washington has said anti-competitive practices
such as corporate collusion and an inefficient retail distribution
system drive up prices and make it difficult for foreign goods to
enter the Japanese market.
   Japan, in turn, says the United States needs to raise its low
savings rate, spend more on research and development, improve
education, consume less and reduce the federal budget deficit.
   The government will face difficulties in passing legislation to
deal with U.S.-Japan problems because the opposition controls the
upper house and must agree to bills passed by the lower house.
   This is particularly true for farm trade issues. Although Japan
is the largest importer of U.S. agricultural products and has
gradually liberalized many of its food products markets, its
refusal to permit rice imports is an especially sore point.
   Opposition parties have adamantly opposed further opening of
Japan's farm markets. They also oppose increased military spending,
although the lower house has the power to pass the budget even if
the upper house votes it down.
   Defense Agency Director-General Juro Matsumoto has said Tokyo
does not plan to change its defense budget for fiscal 1991, which
begins April 1. Japan now shoulders about $2.8 billion, or 45
percent, of American troops' annual expenses here.
   Military spending is a controversial issue in Japan. The
country's constitution bans the use of force for settling
international disputes and the government has tried to keep defense
spending below 1 percent of the gross national product _ $27.8
billion in fiscal 1991.

   Pop musicians Fine Young Cannibals were named best
British group of the year while Phil Collins and Annie Lennox were
named best vocalists at the Brits 1990 Awards.
   The Cannibals's million-selling ``The Raw and the Cooked'' also
won the award for the best album by a British artist or group
during the ceremony Sunday. The band was in Los Angeles, committed
to rehearsals for the U.S. Grammy Awards on Wednesday.
   U.S. singer Neneh Cherry, stepdaughter of jazz trumpeter Don
Cherry, was named best international newcomer and best
international artist at the announcement of the pop awards in
London's 2,000-seat Dominion Theater.
   Ms. Cherry, with the singles ``Man Child'', ``Buffalo Stance''
and ``Kisses on the Wind,'' faced Tina Turner among rival nominees.
   It was the third time Collins, 39, has won the best male
vocalist award and the fourth time Ms. Lennox, 35, who sings with
the Eurythmics, was named best female vocalist.
   Collins' song ``Another Day in Paradise'' was named best of the
year in a poll among British Broadcasting Corp. radio listeners.
   Irish band U2 was named best international group and ``Batman''
the best film soundtrack or original cast recording.
   British male group Queen received a special award for their
outstanding 20-year contribution to the music industry in which
they have broken box office and sales records worldwide.
   The Brits 1990 Awards were organized by the British Phonographic
Industry, which is giving to a music charity the unspecified

<HEAD>County Sheriff Commandeers Armory to Ease Jail Overcrowding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's decision to commandeer the
local National Guard armory to ease jail overcrowding apparently
``struck a chord with John Q. Citizen,'' a spokesman said.
   ``There's a kind of exuberance that someone did something, that
it was a bold act,'' Richard McCarthy, spokesman for Hampden County
Sheriff Michael Ashe, said Sunday night as 15 prisoners prepared to
bed down for the third evening in the armory's gymnasium-sized
drill hall.
   McCarthy said citizens, local judges and other law enforcement
officials have contacted him to voice support for Ashe, who said he
occupied the Springfield armory Friday because he was fed up
fighting jail overcrowding.
   Ashe acted after Westfield District Judge Philip Conant detained
two Hampden County deputies for five hours after they refused to
take a prisoner to the overcrowded jail.
   Ashe planned to ask a Hampden Superior Court judge Tuesday for
an injuction supporting his action as justified due to an imminent
danger to the public's peace, McCarthy said.
   McCarthy said Ashe also would ask the court to force armory
officials to hand over keys to the showers and kitchen. Currently
prisoners are transported to the jail for showers while food for
the inmates is brought into the armory.
   ``We're going to run right at them in court,'' McCarthy said.
``We're not going to go into court on the defensive. Our lawyers
tells us that we're on sound legal ground'' in taking over the
armory.
   The prison originally was built to hold 279 prisoners. The
federal government has ordered that no more than 450 inmates _
either those serving a sentence or those awaiting trial _ may be
housed there.
   That cap was exceeded this week, and McCarthy said the usual
remedies of early release, late sentencing and housing prisoners
elsewhere in Massachusetts had not provided enough space.
   McCarthy blamed the prison space crisis in Springfield on
tougher sentencing laws combined with the public's reluctance to
finance jails or live near them.
   ``My belief is that what we have in Hampden County is a real
perfect microcosm of the whole national dilemma,'' he said.
``There's no constituency for corrections. Liberals find it
distasteful and conservatives find any commitment of resources to
be coddling.''

   Motel guests jumped out of windows and
lowered themselves to the ground using bedsheets to escape fire
from an explosion apparently caused by a natural-gas leak that
killed four and injured 10.
   A night desk clerk was investigating reports of a gas leak at
the 62-unit Super 8 Motel when the explosion occurred early Sunday,
officials said.
   ``I had just gotten up to go to the bathroom and had come back
and my wife said, `Don't you smell the gas?''' said Neal Woodrick,
60, of Trenton, N.J. ``And then it happened.''
   ``It sounded just like a bomb had gone off _ boom,'' said his
wife, Joan Woodrick, 58.
   Fire officials were to comb the charred remains of the motel
today for clues to the explosion.
   All of the 45 to 50 guests were believed to be accounted for,
authorities said.
   Firefighters used a crane, pitch forks and shovels to sift
through piles of charred mattresses, carpet, pink insulation and
dry wall left from the fire and explosion, which threw debris as
far as 300 feet from the building.
   ``I'm almost positive it was a natural gas explosion,''
Hagerstown Fire Chief Gary Hawbaker said. ``The whole front of the
building _ first, second and third floors _ was blown out. That
whole chunk was engulfed.''
   Hawbaker said there was a natural gas line in the middle of the
fire, ``so we couldn't put out the rest of the fire until the gas
was shut off.'' It took firefighters about 30 minutes to shut off
the gas, he said.
   Joan Ganje-Fischer, a spokeswoman for Super 8 Motels Inc. of
Aberdeen, S.D., said that after a guest told the clerk that gas was
leaking from the laundry room area, the gas company told the clerk
to try to turn the gas off.
   ``He was right in the center of the explosion when it
happened,'' she said. ``He came back to the front desk and his hair
was on fire. He put his hair out with a towel, pulled the alarm
notifying the guests, called 911 and then began evacuating the
motel.''
   Donald Lee, 39, of Shorewood, Wis., said he awoke, put on pants,
a shirt and a coat and jumped 12-15 feet out of a second-story
window, breaking his wrist in the fall.
   ``I heard screaming and glass breaking,'' he said. ``A number of
people saw flames. A family had their hair singed.''
   Some guests were moved to a motel across the street, and the Red
Cross provided food, clothing and shelter.
   The dead were identified as James G. Scharnek, 34, of Milwaukee,
Wis.; Kristoddie Brown, 25, of Capital Heights; Mercedes Keyes, 26,
of Hagerstown; and Margretta E. Parker, 70, of Richmond, Va.
   Ten people were treated at Washington County Hospital for smoke
inhalation and minor injuries and were released, spokesman John
Costopoulos said.

   A barge loaded with gasoline caught fire
and spilled some of its cargo when it collided head-on with another
barge in the Intracoastal Waterway, the Coast Guard said today.
   No one was injured and the fire was extinguished at 11 p.m.
Sunday, about 4{ hours after the collision, Coast Guard Petty
Officer Steve Guy said.
   The waterway was closed as a precaution because of an
undetermined amount of gasoline in the water and the possibility of
further fire, Guy said.
   He said crews were letting the burned barge cool down before
starting to clean up the spilled gasoline today.
   The cause of the collision had not been determined, Guy said,
but ``weather may have had something to do with it. We had a lot of
rain and visibility was low.''
   Guy said the crash happened when two tugs escorting barges
approached each other in the Intracoastal Waterway. One tug towed
two barges, each loaded with 30,000 barrels of gasoline. The other
tug towed seven barges, three empty, one containing coke and the
other a solvent with neutral oil.
   Two of the barges collided head-on, and one loaded with gasoline
caught fire.

   Bowling for rhinos is the name of the game
in benefit events the American Association of Zoo Keepers is
holding across the country this week.
   Proceeds go to the efforts to save the endangered African black
rhinoceros, prized by poachers for their horns.
   After Ohio fund-raisers brought in $15,000 in fund-raisers for
black rhinos two years ago, the zoo keepers decided to expand the
program this year to the association's 62 nationwide chapters.
One-third of them have planned bowling events this week.
   When sign-up sheets were posted at the Philadelphia Zoo, the
staff quickly responded.
   ``They loved the idea,'' said zoo spokeswoman Arlene Kut. ``We
have a mixed bag of abilities, including keepers, volunteers, zoo
officials and lab technicians.''
   Weeklong rhino bowl-a-thons began in Philadelphia on Sunday
night. Joe DiMeo, manager of the St. Monica's Bowling Lanes,
reserved all 12 lanes for the zoo's event, and threw in two free
games and bowling shoes for more than 70 bowlers.
   Bowlers are sponsored by the point and by game, according to Ms.
Kut, who said she was sponsoring one bowler for a nickel a point.
   ``I may be out big bucks,'' she said.
   The local chapter hopes to raise $3,000.

   The farmer who owns part of the ``Field
of Dreams'' outfield says he'll restore the land to playing shape
in time for tourists this summer.
   People came by the thousands last year to see the field created
for the Kevin Kostner movie, but all they saw was the infield and
most of right field maintained by farmer Don Lansing. The rest of
the outfield was planted in corn on land owned by farmer Al
Ameskamp.
   People came anyway, just as baseball greats of many years past
appeared when a farmer played by Kostner listened to a dream voice
telling him to ``Build it, and they will come.''
   In the summer of 1988, Ameskamp and Lansing agreed to let
moviemakers carve a baseball diamond in their fields during
filming, and Ameskamp said he was amazed that people wanted to see
the place a year later.
   On some Sundays last summer, traffic was nearly bumper-to-bumper
on the gravel road past the Ameskamp's farmhouse on the way to the
field. ``We ate a lot of dust,'' he said.
   There has been talk of organized tours visiting the plot next
summer, including some from Japan.
   ``I decided even before the Japanese thing that I'd put it back
into grass this year so the field will be back like it was for the
movie,'' Ameskamp said. ``A lot of people stopped here and talked
to us and we tossed the idea around for a quite a while before
deciding to do it.''
   Ameskamp said the field will once again return to crops in 1991.
   ``I'm figuring that there will be a lot of people come to see it
this year, then next summer it'll fizzle out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Two Reported Killed In Nepal as Police Fire on Demonstrators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today opened fire on demonstrators
rallying to demand an end to a 29-year-old ban on political
parties, killing two people and wounding at least 20, witnesses
said.
   Government officials would neither confirm nor deny the reported
shooting at Bhaktapur, near the capital in the Katmandu Valley.
   On Sunday, one policeman and three demonstrators were reported
killed on the first day of a campaign by the outlawed Nepali
Congress Party and the United Left Front, an umbrella group of
Communist Party factions.
   The groups have banded together to seek restoration of a
multiparty system and thousands of demonstrators turned out in
Katmandu on Sunday.
   They shouted ``We want democracy!'' and ``Down with the
panchayat system!'' _ the system of representative assemblies set
up in 1960 when the king accused the Congress Party-led government
of misusing power, ousted it and banned all political parties.
   More than 475 people were reported arrested and about 20 injured
across Nepal on Sunday.
   Katmandu, a city of 235,000 people, was largely deserted today
as shops closed to show support for the opposition. Taxis and
private buses stayed off the roads in support of the campaign, but
some government-run buses continued to operate. Some student
agitators burned a bus in nearby Kirtipur township and smashed the
windshields of a couple of others.
   Activists on Sunday hurled stones and bricks as a
government-sponsored procession of more than 80,000 people, led by
Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha, moved through the
streets, chanting ``We love our king and queen more than our
lives'' and other slogans opposing the protesters.
   Government radio said seven people in the procession were hurt.
   The government has accused the opposition of trying to force its
version of democracy on a nation that already has a working
democracy.
   In his message on Nepal's 40th National Democracy Day on Sunday,
King Birendra noted that Nepalis voted against restoring a
multiparty system in a 1980 national referendum, and said democracy
demands respect for the majority's verdict.
   After the 1980 referendum, Nepalese were given the right to
elect their representatives directly from their constituencies.
Now, 112 members are elected from 75 districts, and the remaining
28 are nominees of the king.
   Only an elected member is eligible to become prime minister.

   Rain fell throughout the soggy South early today, while parts of
the West prepared for more winter weather.
   The rain did not let up early today in Alabama and Georgia,
where swollen rivers forced more than 1,300 people from their homes
during the weekend.
   As much as 3 inches of rain were forecast for northwest Georgia,
where 12 inches of rain Friday caused extensive flooding.
   In northern Alabama, flooding was reported all along the Coosa,
Black Warrior and Tallapoosa rivers. The floods and earlier storms
which spawned tornadoes and violent winds have affected about 2,000
families, according to Red Cross estimates.
   Rain also fell early today in Virginia, the Carolinas and
Washington, D.C..
   Northern California began recovering from heavy storms that
dumped up to 6 feet of snow in the high Sierra, knocking out power
to thousands of people and triggering a mudslide Sunday that
temporarily closed an 85-mile section of Interstate 80 from the
Nevada border to Applegate, Calif.
   In Southern California, a storm flooded Los Angeles streets and
dropped hail on sections of the city, and a rain-triggered sewage
spill closed more than 15 miles of beaches.
   Snow fell Sunday evening over western Utah, northern and central
Nevada, east-central California and western Arizona, with more snow
expected today in much of the region.
   Florida continued to enjoy warm weather, with temperatures early
today of 74 in Miami and 70 in Tampa. Temperatures dipped to 3

   Screaming opposition lawmakers shoved
officials and smashed doors today to protest the aging politicians
of the ruling Nationalist Party who will dominate parliament's vote
for Taiwan's president.
   Three opposition assemblymen were dragged by about 60 police
officers from the convention hall where the National Assembly
convened today for the election. They had occupied the podium and
roughed up officials who tried to stop their demonstration.
   The protesters opposed the choice of Hsueh Yueh, a 94-year-old
retired army general, to preside over the 35-day meeting.
   Opposition Assemblyman Tsai Shi-yuan told the convention that
choosing Hsueh ``was absurd because he is what the public considers
an old thief who has not faced re-election'' in more than four
decades.
   The 752-seat National Assembly includes 646 members elected in
China before 1949, when they fled to Taiwan with the rest of the
Nationalist Chinese government after it lost a civil war to
Communist forces.
   The aging assemblymen were frozen in office to support the
Nationalist Party's claim that it still is the legitimate ruler of
China. Most are at least 70 years old, and several die each year.
Before the session began, a 73-year-old member had a heart attack
at the convention hall and was hospitalized in intensive care.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, which has just 11
seats in parliament, has staged protests calling for the direct
election of Taiwan's president and vice president.
   Police released the detained opposition assemblymen from a
locked bus after they smashed the windows with umbrellas. They
quickly returned to the meeting hall and kicked in glass doors
while President Lee Teng-hui was delivering a speech calling for
``a society with harmony, unity, law and order.''
   Lee, who was nominated as the ruling Nationalist Party's
presidential candidate on Feb. 11, paused briefly during the
commotion before continuing his speech. Later, opposition
Assemblyman Huang Chao-hui overturned several tables at a luncheon
banquet as Lee toasted the elderly members.
   During the National Assembly convention, the body will review
the constitution, including a temporary provision that gives the
president the right to retire all members elected on the mainland.
Many assemblymen oppose that provision.
   The convention will end with the election of Taiwan's next
president and vice president.
   Lee won the universal support of the Nationalist Party's Central
Committee for a full six-year term as president, but many party
elders were disappointed that he picked a personal aide, Li
Yuan-zu, as running mate.
   More than 200 aging assemblymen had supported Chiang Wego, a son
of the late Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, to be the vice
presidential candidate.
   Lee, the first Taiwan native ever to serve as Nationalist
president, assumed that office in January 1988 upon the death of
President Chiang Ching-guo, another son of Chiang Kai-shek.

   Mongolian reformers have capped months of protest
against the Communists' political monopoly by founded a party that
is demanding the ouster of leading officials and a Soviet troop
pullout, a foreign source said.
   Official Mongolian television covered some of Sunday's
deliberations when the Mongolian Democratic Party, pledging to work
within the constitution, was formed Sunday from the Mongolian
Democratic Union.
   The union has organized five mass rallies in the past two months
calling for an end to the Communist Party's nearly 70-year-old
monopoly rule, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Mongolia, a nation of 2 million people spread across the vast
deserts and grasslands of eastern Asia, has cautiously followed the
reform policies taken by its protector state, the Soviet Union.
   Also Sunday, Chinese Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin met a
high-ranking Mongolian Communist Party delegation in Beijing. China
and its northern neighbor have had strained relations and few
contacts for the past three decades because of Mongolia's close
ties with Moscow.
   In the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, more than 470 delegates
to the Mongolican Democratic Union's first congress almost
unanimously adopted a party charter and a platform that urges
changes in Mongolia's political and economic systems, but pledges
to work within the government constitution and under
Marxist-Leninist principles, the source said.
   The Democratic Union, which claims 60,000 supporters, has
stressed in the past that it is not against the Communist Party,
just its monopoly on power.
   Mongolian Premier Dumaagiyn Sodnom hinted last week that a
meeting between party and government officials and the Democratic
Union might take place after the congress.
   The first two hours of the daylong congress were broadcast live
on television and given prominent coverage on the evening news, the
source said.
   Although the official press has published editorials and
readers' letters criticizing the movement as misguided, the local
media have given the Democratic Union considerable attention since
it was formed in December by intellectuals and artists pressing for
reform.
   Sunday's meeting in the Trade Union Palace was attended by 300
observers, including ranking government and Communist Party
officials and foreign reporters, the source said.
   He said the meeting was well-organized and orderly, and there
was no police or government interference. The delegates, mostly in
their mid-20s to mid-30s, were from across Mongolia.
   With a standing ovation, delegates also adopted an open letter
to the people and one to the Communist Party Central Committee and
the Great People's Hural, or parliament.
   The letters repeated calls for the resignation of the Council of
Ministers and the party Central Committee and for trials and
punishment for leaders of past regimes ``who brought the country
its foreign dependence and economic crisis, (including) a huge
foreign debt,'' the source said.
   The Soviet Union has provided massive loans to Mongolia,
estimated by some Western economists to exceed $5.5 billion, he
said.
   Speakers also called for economic reform, a multiparty system
and withdrawal of foreign troops, the source said.
   He said it was the first time the union has called for a troop
withdrawal. Soviet troops were sent into Mongolia to patrol the
border with China in the mid-1960s, when relations between the two
Communist powers had broken down and China's ultra-leftist Cultural
Revolution was in full swing.
   The Soviet Union began withdrawing its forces in May during a
visit by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to China. The Kremlin
has said it will withdraw 50,000 troops, three-fourths of the
estimated Soviet force in Mongolia, by the end of 1990.
   
   On Saturday in Ulan Bator, local news reports said the Politburo
had announced that the capital's last statue of Stalin, in front of
the national library, was coming down, the foreign source said.

   Two large dogs brutally attacked a
10-year-old boy until a neighbor chased them away, authorities said.
   Adam Bolt received 150 stitches in his neck and shoulders after
Saturday's attack and was resting at home in this city 30 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
   The boy said he was outside his family's apartment when the dogs
attacked.
   ``I was just playing in the rain and I looked up and saw them
coming toward me,'' he recalled. ``They were snapping at me and I
started running and they caught me.''
   Neighbor Mary Patuano chased the dogs.
   ``Adam was on his stomach with one dog tearing at his shoulder
like a shark. The other dog was pulling him in the other direction
from his neck,'' Ms. Patuano said.
   She said they looked like neglected guard dogs, one with a rusty
chain around its neck.
   The dogs later were cornered in a nearby oil field and shot to
death, police Sgt. Steve Toth said. He said their owner still had
not surfaced late Sunday.

   Business leaders breathed a collective sigh of
relief today at the governing party's electoral victory,
interpreting it as voter support for the policies that have brought
economic prosperity to Japan.
   But they warned that the scandal-plagued party still must do
more to bolster public trust.
   ``I saw this election as a test for our nation's liberalism, and
my feeling of crisis had been growing,'' Eiji Suzuki, president of
the Japan Federation of Employers Association, said in a statement.
   Eishiro Saito, chairman of the powerful Japan Federation of
Economic Organizations (Keidanren), told reporters: ``The decision
by the people not to destroy the foundation of the free economy,
the basis of Japanese economic growth to date, should be highly
appreciated.''
   He welcomed the Liberal Democratic Party's renewed majority in
Parliament's lower house, but urged more discussion and mutual
understanding between the governing and opposition parties for
greater political stability.
   Shun Ishihara, chariman of the Japan Committee for Economic
Development, warned the Liberal Democrats that they should not
think the public has forgiven and accepted all of their actions.
   ``The party has not fully improved. The Liberal Democratic Party
still needs to be reborn in order to recover the public trust,'' he
added.
   The business community had been concerned about whether the
pro-business governing party could keep control of the government
after it lost its majority in Parliament's less powerful upper
house in elections last July.
   Voters then registered their disapproval of a new 3 percent
sales tax and a widespread influence-buying scandal in which many
leading Liberal Democrats were implicated.
   In Sunday's election for the lower house, which names the prime
minister and controls the budget, anger over the tax and scandal
apparently had faded. In addition, many voters echoed the view of
business leaders that the opposition Socialists were not capable of
governing effectively.
   The Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan since their
party's founding in 1955, ended with a comfortable majority _ 275
of the lower house's 512 seats. The Socialists won 136.
   ``The outcome shows that the Liberal Democrats' taxation policy,
including their stance toward the sales tax, has been accepted by
the people,'' said Rokuro Ishikawa, president of the Japan Chambaer
of Commerce and Industry.
   The Liberal Democrats have promised to review the tax, which
took effect in April, and possibly lower the levy on groceries,
rents and some other items. The opposition has demanded abolition
of the tax.
   Keidanren's Saito supported the review of the tax, but added,
``I do hope the parliamentary session will not be disrupted over
the consumption tax revision when the taxation system is gaining
general acceptance.''
   Since the opposition controls the upper house, a stalemate over
the tax is possible.
   The governing party also might face trouble in enacting
legislation to deal with U.S.-Japan economic friction.
   ``It's the most serious concern for me right now that the trade
dispute between Japan and the United States will get worse,'' said
Isao Yonekura, president of C. Itoh and Co., a leading trading
company.
   Despite the relief of business leaders over the Liberal
Democrats' victory, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index
plunged today.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose more than 130 points in
early trading, as final election returns came in, but then the
market's concern turned to the possibility of higher interest
rates, a dampening factor on stock investment. The Nikkei ended at
37,222.60, down 237.72 points, or 0.63 percent, from last Friday.

   Life gradually returned to normal in the
Christian enclave today as mediators tried to devise a political
settlement to intra-Christian battling that has claimed at least
660 lives.
   The commands of renegade Gen. Michel Aoun and his rival, militia
warlord Samir Geagea, called in separate statements on employees of
the water, electricity and telephone companies in their areas of
influence to start repairing damages inflicted in the 18-day clash.
   By police count, 1,872 people have been wounded in what has been
the bloodiest intra-Christian confrontation since Lebanon's civil
war erupted in April 1975. Police estimated material losses at $750
million.
   Geagea's Lebanese Forces asked industrial, commercial, tourist
and banking institutions, to reopen today ``to help civilians
resume normal life.''
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said workers were removing debris and burned cars from
streets as a two-day-old cease-fire held following ferocious
battles for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.
   ``But despite the calm, people are still wary,'' said the
spokesman. ``They have seen many other cease-fires collapse. Some
areas are still mined and the fortifications have not been
removed.''
   The new truce, declared Saturday, was the 12th since the clashes
started. The others failed to take hold.
   Power plants and water-pumping stations stopped on Jan. 30, the
first day of the fighting, leaving the Lebanese capital and its
environs without electricity and running water.
   A three-man mediating committee, grouping independent Christian
figures, was expected to hold contacts with Aoun and Geagea to
consolidate the cease-fire and work out a settlement to what the
leftist As-Safir daily called ``the game of balancing the Maronite
terror.''
   Both Aoun, 54, and Geagea, 38, are Maronites, the community that
has dominated the government, parliament, army and judiciary since
Lebanon gained independence from France in 1943.
   Aoun started the intra-Christian duel by demanding disbandment
of the 10,000-man Lebanese Forces and attacking with his estimated
19,000 army troops when Geagea refused.
   The Voice of Lebanon radio station quoted a source close to
Geagea as saying the militia chief was ready to ``to begin talks
... based on the necessity of mutual respect and safeguarding
political freedoms.''
   ``What brings the Lebanese Forces and the army together is much
bigger and deeper than what separates them,'' the source quoted
Geagea as saying. ``The Lebanese cause needs the two guns together
and eliminating one of them will weaken the other.''
   The source also said Geagea was sorry that ``our society has
paid this price to be convinced that dialogue is the right path to
solve all the problems.''
   A source close to Aoun retorted that what Geagea has suggested
``is not enough. There can only be a solution by unifying the gun
and not by talking about two guns.''
   Also Monday, classes resumed at the American University of
Beirut after a suspension of nearly three weeks.
   School spokesman Radwan Mawlawi said the university opened after
water was provided for the dormitories and other school buildings.
   The university lies in Syrian-policed Moslem west Beirut, which
has not been involved in the Christian fighting. However, the
Moslem sector has been repeatedly hit by shells since the clashes
erupted, leaving at least 31 people killed and 149 wounded.
   Aoun claims he launched his crackdown on the Lebanese Forces
because Geagea was out to ``force the implementation'' in the
Christian sector of an Arab League-brokered peace accord to end the
civil war.
   President Elias Hrawi, also a Maronite, was elected in line with
the accord in November.
   Aoun has rejected Hrawi as head of state along with the peace
pact. He objects to the accord because it includes no timetable for
the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   Geagea has declared his recognition of Hrawi but the militia
chieftain has refrained from expressing a clear stand on the peace
pact.

   Scandal and an unpopular sales tax cost the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party voter support but it held
on to its majority in Parliament's lower house and with it the
right to name the prime minister.
   The conservative party that has held power for 34 years lost 20
seats in Sunday's balloting but still captured a solid majority of
275 in the 512-seat house, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   The party headed by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu had needed 271
seats to retain the chairmanships of all lower house committees.
   The main opposition Japan Socialist Party, led by Takako Doi,
made dramatic gains, rising from 83 seats in the last house to 136.
   Two prime ministers resigned in quick succession last year amid
sex and money scandals and the popular had Ms. Doi seemed to have a
chance to tilt Japan to the left and become its first woman prime
minister.
   But Japan's conservative voters rejected bold change. During the
campaign, the Liberal Democrats capitalized on ideological
differences in the opposition camp and sowed doubts about the
opposition's ability to govern.
   The Socialists' potential coalition partners fared poorly.
   The Komeito (Clean Government Party) fell from 54 seats in the
outgoing house elected in July 1986 to 45, the Japan Communists
from 26 seats to 16, and the Democratic Socialist Party from 25
seats to 14.
   The remaining seats went to 21 independent candidates and two
minor parties. Official final results are to be announced Tuesday.
   Kaifu, 59, told reporters he was ``very thankful for the result.
Each candidate worked as if he were crawling on the ground, and I
think people gave us credit for that.''
   ``Our purpose was to reduce the Liberal Democrats' strength as
much as possible,'' said Ms. Doi, 61, who had campaigned hard on a
vow to repeal the sales tax. ``Unfortunately, the results showed
that in a sense we have not obtained a majority toward abolishing
the tax.''
   About 73 percent of the 90.5 million eligible voters _ a high
turnout _ cast ballots.
   When the 271st Liberal Democratic seat was captured, Kaifu
painted in the blank eye of a papier-mache doll at party
headquarters in Tokyo to signify fulfillment of the party's goal in
the election. The ``daruma'' doll ceremony is traditionally
performed to indicate fulfillment of a wish.
   Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of the Liberal Democrats, said
his party would consult with the Socialists beginning Tuesday over
steering the nation.
   The 3 percent sales tax and a series of scandals _ which
contributed to the Liberal Democrats' loss of their majority in the
less powerful upper house of Parliament last summer _ proved
insufficient to defeat the Liberal Democrats.
   ``The opposition never clearly explained its coalition plans,''
said Takehiko Kamo, professor of political science at Tokyo
University, ``and so the public didn't feel confident in the idea
of the idea of transferring power to it.''
   Kaifu declared the election results ``a form of purification''
for his troubled party. Yet voters re-elected virtually all Liberal
Democrats in Parliament who were implicated in the Recruit stock
scandal, in which many politicians profited from cut-rate shares.
   ``Simply being elected does not mean one is absolved,'' said
Socialist Secretary General Tsuruo Yamaguchi. ``The need for
political reform is bigger than ever.''
   Among the candidates linked to the Recruit stock scandal who
still won re-election were former prime ministers Yasuhiro
Nakasone, 72, Noboru Takeshita, 65, and Sousuke Uno, 67.
   Takeshita resigned last year after admitting he accepted huge
donations from the Recruit Co. Uno replaced him but lasted just two
months as prime minister. A former geisha said Uno had paid her to
be his mistress, and he resigned after the Liberal Democrats' upper
house loss.
   Only one Recruit figure, former Vice Education Minister Kunio
Takaishi, was defeated. Takaishi, who is being tried on bribery
charges, had not held elective office before.
   Nakasone formally resigned from the party as atonement for his
implication in scandal, although he has denied wrongdoing.
   His re-election may permit him to return to the party and
greater behind-the-scenes influence.
   ``A general election is a judgment by the people, and I
passed,'' Nakasone said Sunday. The Recruit scandal broke after he
left office in 1987, but the stocks-for-favors transactions took
place while he was prime minister, and he was forced to testify to
Parliament about his links to the Recruit Co.
   Altogether, as many as 14 successful independents are expected
to ally themselves with the Liberal Democrats in the new house.
   Financial and currency markets showed little reaction to the
election's outcome.

<TEXT>
   Two strong earthquakes struck the
southwest Pacific today, causing minor damage to buildings on the
North Island of New Zealand and rattling the Vanuatu Islands,
officials said.
   The first quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, struck at
6:35 p.m. (12:35 a.m. EST) about 110 miles northeast of the capital
of Wellington, according to the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden,
Colo.
   Police said the temblor knocked out telephone service, caused
power blackouts and threw store merchandise off shelves. Some
trains were halted as railway staff checked the line and bridges, a
Railways Corporation spokesman said. There were no reports of
injuries.
   USGS spokesman Don Finley said earthquake monitors indicated
that although the quake was centered on North Island, minor damage
was reported in the Palmerston North, Dannevirke and Hastings areas.
   The second quake, measured at a preliminary magnitude of 6.8,
shook the Vanuatu Islands, formerly the Old New Hebrides, a little
more than an hour later, at 5:48 p.m. local time, according to the
USGS. The Vanuatu Islands are located in a different time zone.
   The temblor was centered nearly 2,000 miles north of the first
quake and about 1,300 miles northeast of Brisbane, Australia. There
were no immediate reports of damage or injuries, Finley said.
   By USGS standards, any movement measuring between 6 and 6.9 on
the Richter scale is considered a ``strong'' earthquake.
   ``Those can cause considerable damage in populated areas,''
Finley explained. ``The Vanuatu Islands, they have earthquakes
there quite often, many of them in the 7 and 8 range, and we don't
get much in the way of damage reports there.''
   An earthquake of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread,
heavy damage, while a temblor measuring 8 or more on the Richter
scale is considered a ``great'' earthquake, with potential to cause
tremendous damage, according to the geological survey.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means the ground motion
is 10 times greater.

<TEXT>
   Police clashed with leftists today
over U.S. bases while Defense Secretary Dick Cheney warned that
Washington would abandon the six installations unless differences
over their funding were resolved.
   Cheney, on a two-week tour of the Pacific rim, met for three
hours with Philippine Defense Minister Fidel Ramos in discussions
described as ``very cordial,'' but also ``very forthright.''
   The defense ministers were unable, however, to bridge conflict
over funding of the U.S. military bases. Cheny said the United
States will maintain the installations ``only as long as the
Philippine people wish it to stay, and only if the terms negotiated
are acceptable to both parties.''
   There is growing opposition in the Philippines to the bases,
which are among the largest outside the continental United States.
In 1988 the United States agreed to pay the Philippines about $960
million to maintain the facilities until their lease expired in
1991, but this year Congress significantly cut financial aid to the
bases.
   About 200 members of the leftist League of Filipino Students,
chanting ``Yankees go home!'' marched to the U.S. Embassy and
hurled bottles and rotten tomatoes at police, who charged them with
clubs and tear gas.
   One student was arrested and at least four policemen were
injured in the protest, which occurred near Cheney's hotel.
Earlier, 50 students burned an effigy of Cheney and picketed the
military headquarters with banners reading ``Cheney warmonger, go
home'' and ``White monkey, go home with your bases.''
   In Angeles City, home of Clark Air Base about 50 miles north of
Manila, about 300 protesters hurled rocks at club-wielding police
who tried to stop them from dismantling barbed wire barricades at
the entrance.
   Demonstrators said about 30 students were injured.
   Relations between the two allies have reached new lows in recent
weeks.
   President Corazon Aquino refused to see Cheney, citing the aid
cuts and anger over what officials consider adverse reports about
her government in the American press.
   Cheney's talks with Ramos focused on Filipino claims the United
States has failed to live up to its financial obligations for use
of the six military installations.
   This year, the Bush administration asked Congress for $360
million in funding, but the figure was cut by $96 million, and U.S.
diplomats say it is unlikely the money will be restored.
   ``We recognize there is a shortfall of $96 million over what we
had anticipated,'' Cheney said. ``I also pointed out that in East
Asia, in this part of the world, the United States provided a
little over $600 million, and about $500 million of that comes
specifically to the Philippines.''
   Cheney pledged his ``best efforts'' to restore funding cut by
Congress. He also denied reports in the Philippine press the
cutbacks signal diminished support for the Aquino government.
   ``I think that is a misreading of events to suggest that
somehow, the United States is trying to send signals other than the
one I have already given publicly, which is our very strong
commitment to our alliance with the Philippines.''
   Ramos acknowledged the U.S. administration needs congressional
approval for aid commitments, but said he told Cheney ``time is of
the essence'' in meeting obligations.
   Asked whether Filipinos wanted the bases to remain, Ramos
declined to answer, saying the issue was under discussion in the
Philippine Congress.
   U.S. and Filipino officials are expected to begin talks soon on
extending the bases. Any agreement must be approved by two-thirds
of the 23-member Philippine Senate, where anti-bases sentiment is
strong.
   No date for the talks has been set, and leading Filipino
congressmen have urged Mrs. Aquino to postpone them until the cuts
are restored.
   Cheney's spokesman Pete Williams said the secretary's meeting
had not been intended ``to set a framework for the base
negotiations.''
   Many Filipinos say the United States wants to maintain its bases
here at all costs and that claims of budgetary pressures and a
possible voluntary withdrawal are mere negotiating tactics.
   ``Being a big, rich and powerful nation, it (the United States)
intends to get what it wants by bamboozling the Filipinos into
submission,'' said the independent daily, The Manila Times.
   Cheney later visited the U.S. Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles
west of Manila, and was to visit Clark Air Base on Tuesday before
departing for Japan.
   There are some 18,000 U.S. military personnel based in the
Philippines, with another 20,000 civilian and military dependents.

<HEAD>Miners Begin Voting, Could End Pittston Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CASTLEWOOD, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking miners began filing into local
union halls in three states this morning to decide whether to
accept a contract that would put them back to work nearly a year
after they walked off their jobs.
   James Hicks, president of Virginia local 1259 in Cleveland, Va.,
said he was optimistic his fellow union members would vote for the
contract.
   ``Just listening to the guys talking, I believe it'll go through
down here,'' he said. ``Everybody feels like its a pretty good
contract.''
   United Mine Workers spokesman Gene Carroll said there were no
hitches as secret ballots were cast beginning at 8 a.m.
   ``Everything so far is going according to plan,'' he said.
``Today's the day the membership decides the next step. We'll abide
by whatever they decide.''
   Another union spokesman, John Duray, aid results of the vote
would be announced Tuesday.
   About 1,700 striking miners who have been out of work for 10{
months in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky are voting on the
proposed agreement. In addition, an undetermined number of laid-off
miners still in good standing with the union also were expected to
cast their votes.
   Coal industry analysts say the proposed contract between the UMW
and Pittston Coal Group Inc. represents a compromise on both sides.
   ``On a long-term basis _ if the contract is approved _ both the
company and the union win,'' said Marc Cohen, a coal analyst for
Kidder, Peabody Co. in New York.
   ``On the near-term basis, both sides lost a lot of money,'' he
added.
   Under the tentative agreement, Pittston would continue to pay
100 percent of miners' health-care coverage, rather than forcing
the miners to take on 20 percent of those costs. Pittston also
would continue paying into an industrywide pension fund from which
it had withdrawn.
   Union job security would be enhanced by giving laid-off UMW
miners the first shot at many Pittston non-union jobs.
   The company won the right to operate shifts around the clock.
Union officials said a voluntary Sunday daytime shift might be
added.
   The proposed settlement was reached Jan. 1 with the help of
federal mediator William Usery, who was appointed by Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole. Striking miners received copies of the
pact Friday.
   Last summer, the Pittston walkout touched off wildcat sympathy
walkouts at other coal companies that had settled with the UMW. At
their peak, the wildcat strikes affected tens of thousands of
miners in much of the East and Midwest.

   A ferryboat sank in a river near the

   The ferryboat Calipso-1 sank late Sunday in the Calle river
while traveling between the port cities of Corral and Valdivia, 520
miles south of Santiago.
   The cause of the accident was unclear. Press reports from
Valdivia said the ferry, owned by a local fishing company, might
have collided with the wreckage of a barge that sank in the area
several years ago.
   No further details were immediately available.
   Earlier Sunday, police said a passenger bus collided head-on

19 people and injuring 33.

   Thousands of ethnic Albanians
demonstrated today in Yugoslavia's restive Kosovo province after
hearing rumors about the release of one of the nation's most
prominent political prisoners.
   The official Tanjug news agency later denied the reports, saying
Adem Demaqi remained in jail and had not yet served out a
15-year-prison term he began in 1976.
   Gunfire was heard overnight in Podujevo, a town 20 miles north
of this provincial capital, as Albanians fired into the air to
celebrate the release of Demaqi, a dissident who has spent nearly
29 years in jail for alleged separatist activity.
   The release of Demaqi was one of the main demands by
participants in large demonstrations that shook the region last
month during which at least 27 people died in clashes with riot
police.
   Pristina radio reported Sunday that authorities had released
Demaqi, a 53-year-old sociologist who has been imprisoned almost
continuously since 1959.
   More than 20,000 people gathered to greet him in the village of
Ljupce near Podujevo, and thousands more were were proceeding there
in hope of seeing him, said Sefki Ukai, a local reporter.
   Several hundred university students gathered early today around
their dormitories in Pristina chanting ``Demaqi! Demaqi!'' and
``Victory! Victory!''
   About 20,000 ethnic Albanians marched through Decani, a town
some 45 miles west of Pristina, chanting ``Democracy! Democracy!''
and demanding to speak to the authorities, local journalist sources
said.
   Thousands of schoolchildren, who have boycotted classes
throughout the province for week, skirmished with police in several
towns, but no casualties or arrests were reported.
   Protesters are demanding free elections and greater autonomy for
Kosovo, a province of 1.9 million people, 90 percent of whom are of
Albanian origin.
   The authorities in Yugoslavia's largest republic of Serbia, of
which Kosovo is an administrative part, claim they must retain
control over the province to prevent what they describe as
``harassment and persecution'' of the Serbian minority there by
ethnic Albanians.
   They accuse Albanian ``terrorists and separatists'' of inciting
unrest to allow Kosovo to secede from Yugoslavia and join
neighboring Albania.
   In a related development, the trial of 15 prominent ethnic
Albanians accused of engaging in counter-revolutionary activities
was adjourned today because the father of one of the defense
attorneys was killed during a clash Friday between security forces
and demonstrators.
   ``If our lawyers and their kin are not safe, then we will
dismiss them all and defend ourselves,'' Azem Vlasi, a former
Communist Party head of Kosovo, told the court in Titova Mitrovica,
30 miles north of Pristina.
   The trial, which has been going on since last October, was
adjourned until next week, Vlasi's wife told The Associated Press.

   Parliament today failed to elect a head of
state in its first round of voting after the conservative New
Democracy Party abstained from the roll call.
   The action made it impossible for incumbent President Christos
Sartzetakis, the only candidate in the first round, to receive the
necessary number of votes. New Democracy, Greece's largest
political group, said it would continue to abstain over the next
two rounds of balloting.
   A candidate for a five-year term in the largely ceremonial post
of president must win at least 200 votes in the first two rounds of
balloting in the 300-member unicameral Parliament and 180 votes in
the third.
   The conservatives hold 148 seats, the socialists 128 and the
Communists 21. Three seats belong to independents.
   Sartzetakis, who is also expected to run unopposed in the next
two rounds, received 151 votes. One parliamentarian was absent from
the chamber.
   House Speaker Athanasios Tsaldaris said the second round will be
held on Sunday and the third on March 3. Parties may propose
different candidates in each round.
   Anticipating the deadlock, Parliament last week agreed to hold
general elections on April 8. The first task of the new Parliament
will be to continue voting for a new president.
   New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis said his party would
pick its presidential candidate after general elections, when fewer
votes are required to win the balloting.
   Former Premier Andreas Papandreou's socialist party, or PASOK,
announced its preference for Sartzetakis one hour before the vote
started. Newspapers had speculated that Melina Mercouri _ a
long-time socialist culture minister and actress _ might be a
candidate.
   Sartzetakis was elected by the Socialist and Communist parties
in 1985 and was proposed for re-election by the Communist-led
Coalition of the Left and Progress last week. His term expires on
March 29.
   Sartzetakis is a former Supreme Court judge who gained
recognition as a prosecutor in 1963 when he investigated the murder
of leftist deputy Gregoris Lambrakis by right-wing police
officials. The affair was later made into a film called ``Z''
starring France's Yves Montand.
   The presidential election became a formality this month when
veteran statesman and former President Constantine Caramanlis
turned down the candidacy offered by New Democracy.
   The party that Caramanlis founded in 1974, when a seven-year
military dictatorship collapsed, then said it would not back any
candidate until after general elections.
   ``Party leaders are holding their cards close to their chest
right now, keeping them for the next rounds of voting,'' senior
socialist party official Costas Simitis said Sunday.

   A new lava flow from Kilauea Volcano
that entered an isolated Hawaii Island subdivision over the weekend
has destroyed one vacant home and may have wiped out two other
homes, officials said.
   Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim said it will
be later today before officials can determine the extent of damage
in Royal Gardens subdivision, which has been devastated since
Kilauea's latest and longest eruption began in 1983.
   A helicopter was used Sunday night to evacuate two Royal Gardens
residents whose homes were endangered by lava.
   The fast-moving flow, covering a half mile a day, destroyed at
least one home Saturday, the 75th in Royal Gardens and a
neighboring subdivision since the series of eruptions began seven
years ago. Kim said the home belonged to Peter Heeneman, who left
the subdivision in 1983.
   Kim said information was difficult to come by because previous
flows have cut the road into Royal Gardens. Access is limited to
foot traffic or motorcycles.
   Kilauea has caused more than $20 million in damage since it
began erupting Jan. 3, 1983. It has engulfed 2{ miles of roads, two
miles of water lines and two miles of utility lines.

the release of Nelson Mandela but renewed its demand for sanctions
against South Africa, with only the United States and Britain
opposing continued sanctions.
   The resolution was backed by all 32 Third World and East
European members. The nine other Western countries on the panel
abstained in the roll-call vote requested by West Germany.
   While welcoming Mandela's release, the commission merely ``took
note'' of the lifting of the ban on anti-apartheid organizations
and condemned last September's election as seeking ``to further
entrench white supremacy.''
   Otherwise, the text with its new call for sanctions and its
support for a continued anti-apartheid struggle ``by all available
means'' was largely identical with a resolution approved last year.
   Zola Skweyiya, an observer with the African National Congress,
told the commission the measures announced by President Frederik W.
De Klerk on Feb. 2 fell ``far too short in meeting the fundamental
requirements for free political activity and the abolition of
torture.''
   Mandela, a leader of the African National Congress, said today
he urgently wanted to speak to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by
telephone about her wish to ease sanctions against South Africa.
   ``My intention is to phone and speak to the British premier on
this question,'' he said in a television interview with Britain's
TV-am from his home in Soweto, South Africa.
   Mrs. Thatcher wants to ease Commonwealth and European Community
sanctions to encourage South African reforms and prevent a backlash
by the country's white minority.
   Mandela declined to say when he would telephone Mrs. Thatcher.

   A routine security camera videotape will be
scrutinized for clues to the bombing of two grocery stores in this
wealthy Atlanta suburb, the police chief said today.
   There was only minor damage and no injuries when the bombs
detonated Saturday in a Kroger and a Cub Foods store. The bombs
misfired _ the detonators fired but did not trigger large
explosions, FBI spokesman Pat Johnson said.
   Investigators found ``absolutely no connection'' between the
bombings and the unsolved bombings that killed an Alabama judge and
a Savannah lawyer last December, according to Thomas W. Stokes, an
agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   Roswell Police Chief Jerry King said today that authorities had
no suspects, ``no leads at all.'' Federal investigators from other
regions were called in to help local authorities.
   Because a small bank is inside the Kroger store, King said,
there is a videotape showing everyone entering and leaving that
store. Authorities will view that tape and look for ``anybody
looking suspicious'' or carrying a strange-looking package, he said.
   King said the two bombs were basically identical. ``It was not a
pipe bomb,'' he said. ``It wasn't anything that sophisticated.''
   The two stores that were bombed and two others that were
evacuated after bomb threats Saturday were open and did a brisk
business Sunday. But police in Cobb County, Atlanta and College
Park reported that bomb threats apparently from copycat callers
were phoned to three supermarkets on Sunday. Each store was
evacuated, but no bombs were found.
   ``No one has called claiming credit; it's fairly wide open
saying what the motive is,'' Stokes said.
   He said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had
requested an additional eight to 10 agents from bureaus outside
Atlanta, and they were expected to arrive today.
   ``At this point we ... don't even know why someone would want to
do this,'' King said.
   Stokes would not comment on what investigators may have learned
from the evidence, saying that might ``give other people ideas.''

   An airmailed letter took 10 years and five
months to reach Verona in northern Italy from Buenos Aires,
Argentina, arriving long after the sender and the addressee had
died.
   Angela Bedogni, the daughter of the intended recipient, reported
the case on Monday. Her mother, Elvira Cappelletti Bedogni, died in
Verona eight years ago. The sender, Elina Cappelletti, a
sister-in-law who lived in Argentina, died a few years ago.
   The Italian postal system is notorious for inefficiency, but no

was mailed in September 1979.

reports said.
   Rescue teams could not reach the collapsed houses in Karliova
township in Bingol province because of more than 6 feet of snow
that piled up in the past two days, the provincial governor was
quoted as telling the Anatolia news agency.
   Roads and railways were blocked, airports were closed and
electricity was cut off in 900 villages, Anatolia said.
   Most village roads also were closed in the central province of
Konya and in the eastern Black Sea coastal region because of heavy
snowfall, Anatolia reported.

<HEAD>East German Premier: Won't Beg For West German Help</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Bonn leaders agreeing against NATO

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist premier said today
he refuses to beg West Germany for aid ``on my knees,'' and said
claims by Bonn officials that his country faces imminent economic
collapse were irresponsible.
   Premier Hans Modrow, speaking at the weekly talks between the
government and opposition groups, made the remarks in a report on
the results of his two-day visit to Bonn last week.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government rejected Modrow's request
for immediate aid of $9 billion to help East Germany's struggling
economy.
   Kohl made it clear West Germany would provide billions of
dollars to improve living conditions in East Germany but said he
would wait until a democratically elected government takes over
after March 18 elections.
   ``I can understand the disappointment of many (East German)
citizens,'' Modrow told the session. ``But my government cannot do
more than it is already trying to do.''
   ``I will not go down on my knees to beg for such a show of
solidarity'' from the Bonn government, he said.
   He also criticized what he called ``irresponsible,'' comments by
one of Kohl's top advisers last week that East Germany would soon
be unable to pay its bills, and that the March 18 election may have
to be moved up because of instability.
   ``I reprimanded this irresponsibility in Bonn,'' Modrow said,
``but we did not get an official explanation or apology.''
   Both German governments had quickly denied such a collapse was
imminent, though about 2,000 East Germans continue to flee westward
daily despite reformist moves since hard-line leader Erich Honecker
was ousted in October.
   Meanwhile, in Bonn, the defense and foreign ministers today
agreed that neither West German nor other NATO troops should be
stationed in what is now East German territory if the two countries
reunite.
   The joint statement issued by Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher moved
toward settling a dispute that rocked Kohl's center-right coalition
government over the weekend.
   The two ministers, who belong to different coalition parties,
reached agreement after meeting at Kohl's request. Earlier,
Stoltenberg had insisted that German troops placed under NATO
command should be deployed throughout German territory as part of
the alliance's security umbrella for the newly united nation.
   The dispute was over whether a united Germany's relationship
will belong to NATO, a move already rejected by the Soviet Union.
The Western allies want a reunited Germany to remain in NATO, while
the Soviet Union has insisted that a new state should be neutral.
   West Germany has about 490,000 soldiers, while East Germany has
170,000. In addition, 380,000 Soviet troops are stationed in East
Germany, while NATO has more than 300,000 soldiers in West Germany.
   The West Germans reportedly have promised to cut their forces by
about 100,000. East Germany would disband its army as part of the
two-stage plan for German reunification agreed on last week by the
four World War II allies, according to a statement last week by
David Shorr, an analyst at the British-American Security
Information Council in Washington.
   With the dispute over the role of NATO cooling down, the debate
over Poland's western borders heated up today, with an association
of West Germans Germans forced to leave former German land
declaring they will not give up their claims on Silesia.
   Kohl's failure to clearly recognize Poland's border has led
Warsaw to demand to be included in talks on German unification.

<TEXT>
   Liquified propane from a derailed tank car
continued burning early today while three families who lived near
the wrecked train had to stay away from their homes for a second
night.
   A huge fireball rushed out of the tank car when it derailed
along with 23 other cars of the 42-car train Saturday morning near
Emhouse, about 40 miles south of Dallas. No one was injured.
   Firefighters were draining the propane from the tanker to let it
burn off, said Corsicana Fire Chief Troy England.
   ``The tank car is not burning. The firefighters have tapped it
(the propane) off into a pit and are flaring it off in the pit,''
said England.
   Meahwnile, firefighters under the supervision of the Texas
Railroad Commission pumped water into the tank car to cool down hot
spots.
   Three families living closest to the derailment still hadn't
been allowed to return to their homes as of this morning.
   Officials worried that a spilled car load of sodium chlorate
powder, 50 feet from the tanker, could become involved in the fire.
   ``Sodium chlorate is an oxidizer,'' Corsicana Fire Capt. Darrell
Stevenson. ``If there is any fire around, it just enhances the
fire. The fire will burn more intensely.''
   Emtech Environmental Services Inc., a hazardous chemicals team,
covered the car containing sodium chlorate and the surrounding area
with a plastic tarp Sunday, when light rain fell. A chemical
reaction can make the substance smolder when it gets wet.
   Nobody was injured in the accident, and the three crew members,
whose names haven't been released, underwent drug tests, a normal
procedure following train derailments. The results haven't been
made public.
   The train, bound for Houston from Tulsa, Okla., lost its last 24
cars on a curve, said John Grundmann, superintendent of operations
for Fort Worth-based Burlington Northern, which owns the train.

<TEXT>
   Jury selection began under tight security today
for the trial of a man charged with shooting a young woman whose
rape and slaying may have been a motive for the mail bomb killings
of a lawyer and a judge.
   Fifty potential jurors were brought into Fulton County Superior
Court for the trial of Emmanuel Hammond, 24, of Marietta, who is
accused of killing Julie Love.
   When Judge Ralph Hicks told them the jury will be sequestered
and the trial will take up to three weeks, 24 of the 50 said
serving on the panel would be a serious hardship.
   The courtroom was inspected by bomb-sniffing dog teams, which
are to be brought in before each day's session of the trial, and
metal detectors were in place outside the courtroom door. In
addition, armed sheriff's deputies guarded the courtroom inside and
out.
   Hammond is charged with murder, felony murder, kidnapping and
armed robbery in the shotgun slaying of Ms. Love, 27. The preschool
fitness teacher's body was found dumped in northwest Atlanta in
August, more than a year after she disappeared.
   Hammond is black; Ms. Love is white. A letter claiming
responsibility for December mail bombings that killed a federal
judge in Alabama and a lawyer in Georgia cited Ms. Love's death and
decried crimes by blacks against whites.
   Police believe Hammond was the triggerman in the slaying.
Hammond's cousin, William Porter, pleaded guilty in November to
felony murder, rape, kidnapping and armed robbery in the case.
Porter, 20, of Union City, has not been sentenced and was expected
to testify against Hammond.
   Prosecutors said they will seek the death penalty if Hammond is
convicted.
   A finding was made this month that Hammond, being held without
bond in county jail, was competent to stand trial.
   The case drew renewed attention after Christmas when a letter to
an Atlanta television station said a group called ``Americans for A
Competent Federal Judicial System'' claimed responsibility for four
mail bombs.
   Two bombs killed federal appeals Judge Robert S. Vance and
attorney Robert Robinson; two more were interecepted at the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, on which Vance served,
and at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International appealed Monday to Morocco's
King Hassan to intervene personally to end human rights abuses that
it said have persisted for many years in his country.
   The worldwide human rights organization said it was concerned
about the reported torture and disappearances of political suspects
while in custody, prolonged detentions without outside contact, and
unfair trials.
   The appeal followed a meeting with the king and talks with
senior government officials in Marrakesh and Rabat last week. It
accompanied a report calling on the Moroccan government to review
its detention procedures, especially a form of police custody known
as ``garde a vue'' _ ``kept from sight.''
   Amnesty International said its delegation also raised with the
king concerns about continued incommunicado detention of some
military officers after their prison sentences expired, and the
long-term detention of prisoners of conscience. It said one family
has been held without trial since 1972.
   Amnesty International said it sent a copy of its report to the
government of Morocco before last week's meetings and discussed it
with the country's ministers of interior and justice and a
specially constituted commission of high-ranking officials and
magistrates.
   The commission submitted a written response, but Amnesty
International said neither the response nor the discussions settled
its concerns.
   However, it said it welcomed the government's willingness ``to
engage in a prompt and detailed examination of its concerns'' and
to receive another Amnesty International delegation within one
month.
   The Moroccan response, released by Amnesty International, noted
the government was a signatory to international human rights
accords and said it was vigilant about investigating allegations of
human rights abuses.
   Amnesty International said only one in five alleged deaths after
torture in 1989 is known to have been investigated and the findings
were not disclosed.
   ``Garde a vue'' allows police to detain suspects for
interrogation without referring the cases to the judiciary.
Suspects held in such conditions are not allowed to see relatives,
lawyers or independent doctors, Amnesty International said.
   After interrogation, they must sign a police statement before
being brought before a magistrate, it said. While waiting, they are
often tortured to extract false confessions or as punishment, it
said.
   The legal time limit on such detention is frequently exceeded,
arrest dates are falsified on police statements, and extensions
granted without the suspect being brought before a court, Amnesty
International said.
   The torture and ill-treatment inflicted in police stations and
secret detention centers, especially in Casablanca, included being
bound, blindfolded and forbidden to talk for weeks or months,
according to the report.
   It quoted former detainees as saying the soles of their feet
were beaten, they were nearly suffocated by having their heads
plunged into buckets of water, mud or excrement, and were suspended
in contorted positions.

<TEXT>
   Fighting alone to relax South African sanctions
and evoking World War II memories over German reunification, Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher appears at her most isolated
internationally.
   Critics, including some of her own supporters and
pro-Conservative newspapers, accuse her of forfeiting Britain's
influence in a fast-changing Europe and in a post-apartheid South
Africa by clinging to outdated attitudes.
   Thatcher aides argue that on Germany, she says out loud what
others believe. On South Africa, they say it is her policy of
seeking to encourage, not punish, the white rulers that has helped
bring reforms and the Feb. 11 release of Nelson Mandela.
   The storm over Mrs. Thatcher's foreign policy and charges of
Cold War nostalgia have blown up amid mounting government
unpopularity on domestic issues, particularly because of soaring
interest rates and a controversial new property tax.
   Trailing in opinion polls for the last nine months, the
Conservatives slumped to a 15-year low behind the socialist Labor
Party in the two latest surveys this month, by Gallup and ICM. Both
showed Labor with about 50 percent support and the Tories 15 points
behind.
   At a meeting in Dublin on Tuesday, Britain will try to get the
12-nation European Community to lift a ban on new investment in
South Africa. If the others refuse to budge, Britain has indicated
it may break ranks.
   ``If we fail to reach agreement, then the government must
reserve its right to act on its own, if necessary,'' Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd said during angry exchanges in the House of
Commons last week.
   Retorted Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman: ``To
be alone in the world and right is heroic. But to be alone in the
world and wrong is futile and destructive.''
   He was shouted down by Conservative Party legislators. But there
were signs of unease among the governing party rank-and-file, and
several urged that Britain stick with the rest of the community
over sanctions.
   On German reunification, Britain welcomed last week's agreement
providing for the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and
France _ conquerors of Nazi Germany in World War II _ and the two
Germanys to agree on the external repercussions.
   But Mrs. Thatcher continues to sound cautious.
   In a speech to Britain's Jewish leaders Sunday, she said one
Germany was inevitable, but added, ``It is understandable that for
some, bitter memories of the past should color their view of the
present and future.''
   Last week, Mrs. Thatcher sympathized with Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki's fears about Poland's borders, which include
prewar German territories. Britain and Poland, she said, shared
experiences this century ``which we are determined should not
happen again.''
   London's pro-Conservative Sunday Times accused Mrs. Thatcher of
``consummate folly to give the Germans the impression that the
British government is, at best, grudging in its support for the
reunification of the two parts of their nation and, at worst,
hostile.''
   Another usually staunch Thatcher supporter, London's Daily
Express, complained in an editorial Monday: ``Surely, 45 years
after the end of World War II ... we can accept this momentous
event (German reunification) with something more imaginative and
generous than public foreboding?''
   Mrs. Thatcher has been isolated abroad before and often this has
proved a vote-winner at home, such as her battles in the 1980s in
the European Community over money and French-inspired grandiose
plans for closer unity.
   Even when polls have shown little voter support for an issue,
such as her backing of President Reagan's bombing of Libya in 1986,
she has won praise for courage and honesty.
   Criticism of her foreign policy is heightened by a widespread
perception in Britain that since President Bush took over, the
special relationship with the United States has waned. Thatcher
aides deny this.

   Interim President Ion Iliescu today
threatened to ``severely punish'' the leaders of a violent
demonstration in which hundreds of angry protesters smashed windows
and invaded government headquarters.
   ``Down with Iliescu!'' demonstrators shouted Sunday as they took
over the headquarters on Victory Square used by Prime Minister
Petre Roman since Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was ousted.
It was the most violent protest since the December revolution.
   ``The only solution is another revolution!'' the protesters
shouted.
   In a message broadcast on state radio, Iliescu said he ordered
an investigation to identify the protest leaders, whom he described
as ``circles interested in destabilizing the situation in our
country and restoring the vestiges of the dictatorial regime'' of
Ceausescu.
   Iliescu charged the protest was ``not a demonstration by those
who want to rescue the revolution, but they were
counter-revolutionaries.''
   ``Those who violate the law must be severely punished because
they commit acts against national interests,'' Iliescu said. He did
not say what would happen to the protest leaders if they are caught.
   More than 1,000 people cheered as protesters smashed the windows
and glass-and-metal doors of the headquarters using rocks and iron
carpet rods. About 500 people poured in and destroyed part of the
rooms and furniture.
   Hundreds of extra soldiers arrived after the takeover and pushed
back the crowd, which grew to around 5,000 before dwindling to
about 100. Ten armored personnel carriers were wheeled to the front
of the building.
   The army blocked the entrance after allowing many demonstrators
to leave.
   Scores of National Salvation Front supporters launched a small
counter-demonstration outside the building housing Iliescu's
office, yelling ``Terrorists! Terrorists!''
   Government spokesman Dan Radulescu said 120 demonstrators were
detained, questioned and then released without being charged.
   He said the police ``took down statements as to who sent them
and why they were there,'' but aded, ``they were mostly drunk, and
they were released and probably will not be investigated any
further.''
   The crowd had demanded that Iliescu step down, saying the
government was dominated by Communists from the despised Ceausescu
leadership. Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22 and executed three
days later, following a summary trial.
   Opposition to the National Salvation Front, which took power
following December's revolution and includes several former
Communists, has been evident almost since Ceausescu's fall.
   The Romanian state news agency Rompres reported more than 20
paratroopers were severely wounded in Sunday's occupation and
Romanian state TV showed what it said were injured paratroopers in
a hospital late Sunday. But Radulescu said only ``three or four
soldiers were injured, crushed by the mob.''
   Workmen removed the debris around the government headquarters
today and set new glass panes into the dozens of ornate windows and
doorways destroyed by the demonstrators.
   The front of the building was blocked by 12 armored personnel
carriers, and surrounded by 300 soldiers, including sharpshooters.
   In his statement, broadcast from the meeting of the 21-member
Executive Bureau, Iliescu said it was ``regrettable that this
happens just as our political situation gave us reason for hope.''
   The Executive Bureau is the decision-making body of Romania's
253-member multi-party Council of National Unity, which will serve
as the legislative organ until elections, scheduled for May 20.
   The Council of National Unity, which was formed earlier this
month in the wake of considerable popular pressure for the front to
share power, is to lead Romania until general elections scheduled
for May. 20.
   It includes representatives of 37 political parties and interest
groups as well as the front, which critics claim still maintains
control.
   In Paris, interim Romanian Prime Minister Petre Roman said the
protesters represented an insignificant number of Romanians and
that officials in Bucharest assured him ``all was in order.''
   Earlier, he told reporters that recent protests were the product
of a population coming to grips with democracy after decades of
harsh totalitarian rule.``It's a lack of confidence in democracy,''
he said.
   The only government official in the building at the time of the
takeover Sunday was Vice Prime Minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu.
Iliescu recently moved his office to the old Grand National
Assembly building several miles away.
   At one point, demonstrators found Voiculescu and dragged him
onto the balcony where he was jeered. Soldiers moved in and hustled
him to his office, which they locked and guarded from hundreds of
demonstrators yelling ``Voican! Voican!''
   An army colonel said that authorities did not issue orders to
shoot.
   ``If we had gotten an order to fire, we would have fired and
finished this off in two seconds,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   The opposition says the front seeks a return to one-party rule
in Romania, which lacks a democratic tradition. Ceausescu brutally
suppressed opposition during his 24-year rule, carrying on the
intolerance of his predecessors in postwar Communist Romania.
   Long-dormant political parties whose leaders spent decades in
exile or prison thus face formidable obstacles in organizing
campaigns to challenge the provisional government, which controls
the broadcast media, the military and all major industry.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said Monday the voters
gave his party a vote of confidence in its time of greatest crisis
by keeping the Liberal Democrats in control of Parliament.
   Some Japanese who voted Sunday said they were angry with the
Liberal Democrats because of political scandal and an unpopular
sales tax but still were not ready to entrust the government to the
opposition Socialists.
   Business leaders called the result a vote for the economic
policies that have brought unprecedented prosperity to Japan.
   Liberal Democrats implicated in the Recruit influence-buying
scandal were re-elected, including former prime ministers Yasuhiro
Nakasone, 72, and Noboru Takeshita, 65. Nakasone ran as an
independent.
   Kaifu said they were ``absolved'' by the voters but added: ``We
must proceed with political reforms'' in the party that has
governed Japan since its founding in 1955.
   ``We started when the party was said to be in the greatest
crisis since it was formed,'' he told reporters. ``The result of
the election is a vote of confidence of the people under the
constitution, and our government has passed it.''
   Socialist Party leader Takako Doi also claimed a victory, on
grounds that ``our purpose was to reduce the Liberal Democrats'
strength as much as possible.''
   Her party campaigned on opposition to the 3 percent sales tax
introduced last year and reminded voters of the scandal, in which
the Recruit Co. information and publishing conglomerate made large
contributions to politicians and sold them stock at insider prices.
   Ms. Doi said Nakasone, Takashita and others touched by the
scandal won re-election to Parliament because of their powerful
political machines.
   The Liberal Democrats got 275 seats in Parliament's powerful
lower house, a 512-seat body that chooses the prime minister and
sets the budget. Fourteen more candidates who ran as independents
are expected to join them. Before the election, the party had 295
seats.
   When the Liberal Democrats reached 271 seats Monday morning,
giving the party control of all committees in the lower house,
Kaifu filled in the blank eye of a papier-mache ``daruma'' doll in
a traditional ceremony signifying fulfillment of a wish.
   Socialists won 136 seats, up from 83.
   Liberal Democrats won 30.3 million votes, or 46.1 percent of the
total, down from 49.4 percent in the last lower house election in
1986. Socialists took 16 million votes, or 24.4 percent, a sharp
increase from 17.2 percent in 1986.
   Hideo Sato, dean of international relations at Tsukuba
University, said in an interview the Liberal Democrats won because
``Socialists and other opposition parties were not able to provide
substantive arguments in terms of specific policies. They were just
parroting their opposition to the consumption tax.''
   One scandal-tainted candidate who lost was Kunio Takaishi, a
former vice minister of education who benefitted from low-priced
shares of a Recruit subsidiary and is being tried on bribery
charges. He ran as an independent.
   On Sunday, police arrested a ranking aide to Takaishi on
suspicion of buying votes.
   A total of 23 people were arrested on suspicion of election law
violations and 19 of the cases involved vote buying, a National
Police Agency official said.
   Rei Shiratori, chairman of the political science department at
Tokai University, said the Recruit scandal had faded somewhat and
noted that many voters already had expressed their feelings in
elections last July, ousting the Liberal Democrats from control of
the less powerful upper house.
   Kaifu, 59, said of his party: ``Each candidate worked as if he
were crawling on the ground, and I think people gave us credit for
that.''
   The prime minister's position had appeared shaky because of his
weak personal power base in the party and doubts about the Liberal
Democrats' chances. On Monday, Kaifu said he would serve out his
two-year term as party president and pledged to fulfill his
election promises.
   One of Japan's major newspapers, Asahi, said in an editorial
Tuesday the Liberal Democrats ``should not be allowed to shelve
their campaign promise of reforming the political system and forget
the lessons of the Recruit influence-peddling scandal.''
   ``The ills of using huge amounts of money on the campaign
worsened in the recent election,'' it said. ``The LDP should
seriously revise its political structure.''
   Ms. Doi said her party would continue working for repeal of the
sales tax, but acknowledged the election results ``showed that, in
a sense, we have not obtained a majority toward abolishing the
tax.''
   The Liberal Democrats have promised to ease the sales tax on
groceries and some other items.

   Black sludge that washed onto 22 miles
of ocean shore today was believed to be a naturally occurring
phenomenon, authorities said.
   Lt. Kent Mack, commander of the Coast Guard station at Fire
Island, said the goo was an outbreak of algae that washed ashore in
a sludgelike mass after a cold snap killed it off.
   ``It's a natural algae material, biological in nature, with no
petroleum base and no sewage base,'' he said.
   Mixed in with the algae, Mack said, were tens of thousands of
crab shells shed by the creatures during moulting. The moulting is
normal at this time of year, he said.
   Fire Island is a 30-mile-long ribbon of popular beachland
parallel to Long Island's southern shore.
   Police originally said the foam may have sickened a harbor seal
found stranded and panting for breath Sunday on Fire Island. But
Mack said later that the seal had a respiratory problem and also
might suffer from seal pox, a virus.
   Jeannot Smith, a marine technician at the Okeanos Research
Foundation, said tests had not been completed to confirm the seal
pox diagnosis.
   Smith said no animals had been brought to the foundation with
illnesses that might be linked to the foam.

<HEAD>Police Return Controversial Film, Re-release Planned</HEAD>

   A movie distribution company
said Monday it will re-release the anti-apartheid film ``Cry
Freedom,'' which was confiscated the day it opened in South Africa
almost 19 months ago.
   United International Pictures said police returned the copies of
``Cry Freedom'' seized July 29, 1988, when authorities said the
picture was a danger to public safety.
   The company said a new nationwide release was planned April 27.
   The film, directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, focuses on black
activist Steve Biko, who died in South African police detention in
1977, and Donald Woods, a white journalist who befriended him.
   The Publications Appeals Board, the government's censorship
body, announced July 29, 1988, that the film could be shown uncut,
and it immediately opened in more than 30 cinemas nationwide.
   But less than nine hours later, police confiscated copies of the
film and said it contributed to the ``revolutionary climate'' in
South Africa.
   However, since President F.W. de Klerk took office in August he
has allowed peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and has been
more tolerant of anti-government criticism than his predecessor,
P.W. Botha.
   This month, de Klerk allowed black leader Nelson Mandela to be
freed from prison after he had served 27 years for anti-government
activities.

<HEAD>Cheney Says Costs, Reception Key to Keeping U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
shunned by Philippine President Corazon Aquino, told Filipino
officials Monday that the United States will abandon its bases here
if it finds that keeping them is too expensive or that Americans
are unwelcome.
   As violence was reported in several clashes between leftist
protesters and police near U.S. installations, Cheney met for
nearly three hours with Defense Minister Fidel Ramos in discussions
that were described as ``very cordial, very forthright.''
   Meeting reporters afterward with Ramos, Cheney said the United
States ``will stay only as long as the Philippine people wish it to
say _ and only if the terms negotiated are acceptable to both
parties.''
   At issue in Monday's discussions was a $96 million cut Congress
made in the Bush administration's request of $360 million to
compensate the Philippines for the six bases, which include two of
the United States' largest overseas installations, Clark Air Base
and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   ``We recognize there is a shortfall of $96 million over what we
had anticipated,'' Cheney said. ``I also pointed out that in East
Asia, in this part of the world, the United States provided a
little over $600 million, and about $500 million of that comes
specifically to the Philippines.''
   Cheney has said his discussions with Filipino officials did not
amount to the beginning of negotiations to extend the base
agreement, which expires next year.
   An influential Filipino minority is pressuring Mrs. Aquino not
to renew the agreement. In addition, leading Filipino congressmen
have urged her to postpone those discussions until this year's cuts
are restored.
   There are some 18,000 U.S. military personnel in the
Philippines, plus 20,000 dependents.
   For his part, Ramos acknowledged that the Bush administration
needs congressional approval for aid commitments but said he had
told Cheney that ``time is of the essence'' in meeting current U.S.
obligations. The secretary said Ramos had been ``very direct and
very forthright'' in presenting his government's position.
   Mrs. Aquino was so upset over the congressional cut that she
announced before Cheney began his two-week tour of Asian nations
hosting U.S. bases that she would not see him, leaving that task to
her defense minister.
   The secretary pledged his ``best efforts'' to restoring the $96
million cut but U.S. diplomats have said that an austerity-minded
Congress is unlikely to change its mind.
   Despite the current differences, Cheney said that ties between
the two nations are strong.
   ``I think that is a misreading of events to suggest that
somehow, the United States is trying to send signals other than the
one I have already given publicly, which is our very strong
commitment to our alliance with the Philippines,'' the secretary
said.
   When asked whether he could say that his government wanted the
base to remain, Ramos declined to answer the question, saying the
issue was under discussion in the Philippine Congress.
   After the talks with Ramos, Cheney flew to the Subic Bay base,
50 miles west of Manila, to inspect a helicopter carrier and to
chat with a group of Marines and sailors.
   While there were no reports of violence at Subic Bay, about 300
militants hurled rocks at police trying to stop them from
dismantling barbed wire barricades at the entrance to Clark.
   Demonstrators said about 30 students had been injured. The
protesters regrouped later and staged an ``indignation rally,''
accusing Philippine police of being ``puppets of U.S. imperialism.''
   In Manila, about 200 members of the militant League of Filipino
Students, chanting ``Yankees go home,'' marched to the U.S. Embassy
and hurled bottles and rotten tomatoes at police, who charged with
clubs and tear gas.
   One student was arrested and at least four policemen were
injured in the protest, which occurred near Cheney's heavily
guarded hotel.
   Earlier, about 50 students burned an effigy of Cheney and
picketed the military headquarters garrison with banners reading
``Cheney warmonger, go home'' and ``White monkey, go home with your
bases.''
   Cheney, who is to leave the Philippines on Tuesday for Okinawa
and Tokyo, is due to head back to Washington on Saturday.
   He is touring the Asian nations with U.S. bases in preparation
for an April 1 assessment he is to give Congress on the nation's
military posture in the Pacific.
   He has been telling officials in each nation that there is a
limit to the Pentagon pocketbook and that budget pressures may
force 10 percent to 12 percent cutbacks in U.S. military forces
based in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.

   The debate in Japan over the Recruit scandal hasn't
ended, even after a national election in which most of the
politicians tainted by the influence-peddling case won seats in
Parliament.
   People are asking whether the most heavily tainted politicians
can return to the inner circle of power, and whether Japanese
voters tolerate too much corruption.
   But the question of whether the governing Liberal Democratic
Party survived its worst postwar scandal was a firm yes.
   It won a strong, albeit reduced, majority in the powerful lower
house of Parliament on Sunday, and leaders claimed this proved the
people had accepted its apologies and promises of reform.
   In Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's view, the vote was ``a form of
purification.''
   The opposition disagreed. Socialist Chairwoman Takako Doi
attributed the re-election of Recruit-tainted figures to powerful
political machines.
   But Rei Shiratori, dean of the political science faculty of
Tokai University, said the scandal had limited impact because it
was almost two years old and no longer headline news.
   Many voters had used up their anger by voting against the
Liberal Democrats in July's election for the less powerful upper
house of Parliament, said Shiratori.
   Still, voters Sunday punished virtually all of the
scandal-touched politicians by giving them fewer votes than in the
previous election. The candidates scraped through thanks to the
Japanese system of multi-seat constituencies, Shiratori said.
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, for instance, who
resigned from the party in disgrace last year, had been a strong
vote-getter for many terms in his Gunma prefecture constituency.
   The constituency has four seats, and though Nakasone did not win
nearly as many votes as in previous years, he managed to place
third and captured a seat. Nakasone asserted he had been absolved.
   Kaifu, who pledges political reform every time he gives a
speech, was asked at a news conference Monday whether the party
would welcome back the 72-year-old Nakasone and Takao Fujinami, 57,
Nakasone's one-time chief Cabinet secretary who is on trial for
bribery in connection with the Recruit affair. Both ran as
independents.
   Kaifu said the voters had issued their verdict by re-electing
Nakasone and Fujinami, but ``that doesn't mean they will be
unconditionally accepted by the party. The LDP as a party has been
pushing for political reforms.''
   In addition, the Liberal Democrats do not need the votes of
Nakasone and Fujinami to form a majority in the 512-seat lower
house, as they won 275 outright and there are other conservative
independents to call upon if needed.
   The Recruit scandal erupted in the summer of 1988. In less than
a year it sent the Liberal Democrats' popularity plummeting amid
disclosures that the Recruit Co., an information-services
conglomerate, had lavished huge political donations and cut-price
share deals on leading politicians, news media executives,
businessmen and bureaucrats to buy influence. The share deals
occurred while Nakasone was prime minister.
   Dozens of prominent officials resigned with careers in tatters,
and two politicians, six bureaucrats and four Recruit executives
are being tried for giving or accepting bribes.
   Noboru Takeshita resigned as prime minister last spring after
admitting accepting $1.3 million in donations from Recruit. He,
too, was re-elected Sunday, and is widely held to be pulling the
strings behind Kaifu, who had no personal power base when he was
vaulted from obscurity into the premiership.
   Columbia University Professor Gerald L. Curtis, asked at a
meeting with foreign journalists whether Japanese voters have a
high tolerance for corruption, said it was at least partially true.
   Voters believe most politicians are corrupt and may think those
who have been caught are simply unlucky, deserving of a sympathy
vote, Curtis said.
   Curtis said an anti-corruption climate is building in Japan, but
it has not completely taken over.
   He recounted a campaign meeting last month where the host
introduced the incumbent candidate by saying ``he wasn't involved
in Recruit, but please don't hold that against him. He has good
connections with the business community.''

   Seattle-area residents enduring record cold dug out from a rare
10-inch snowfall, while another round of thunderstorms threatened
the South with more flooding.
   Heavy snow fell today across northern Arizona and state
officials closed a 200-mile stretch of east-west Interstate 40
between Kingman and Winslow for seven hours today before reopening
it before noon. As of 7 a.m., Flagstaff had 13 inches of snow and
the south rim of the Grand Canyon reported 17 inches.
   Northern California was digging out today from heavy storms that
dumped up to 6 feet of snow in the high Sierra, knocking out power
to thousands of people and triggering a mudslide that closed an
interstate highway.
   In southern California, a storm flooded Los Angeles streets and
dropped hail on sections of the city, and a rain-triggered sewage
spill closed 18 miles of beach. Snow cut part of an interstate
linking the region with the north for several hours Sunday.
   Floods since late last week have been blamed for six deaths in
Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and North Carolina. One man was
reported missing in Georgia. In the West, one skier was rescued
today and a second was missing after an avalanche Sunday near
Crested Butte, Colo.
   The National Weather Service withdrew flash flood watches today
for soggy northwest Georgia, where 12 inches of rain Friday caused
extensive flooding that forced more than 1,000 to leave their
homes, because rain early today was light.
   However, the worst flooding since 1951 was expected today along
the Oostanaula River and the Conasauga River.
   Fannin County authorities said about 200 people remained
homeless Sunday. And in Trion, Ga., residents made do without
electricity and water Sunday after Friday's rampage of the Chatooga
River. Chattooga County Sheriff Gary McConnell said about 200
families were still unable to return to their homes.
   Weather service meteorologist Gary Beeley said residents might
be fooled by the light rain and fail to take precautions. He warned
that larger rivers often flood days after heavy rain.
   ``All the rain two or three days ago is just now flowing into
main rivers and causing them to rise,'' he said.
   In northern Alabama, extensive flooding was reported all along
the Coosa, Black Warrior and Tallapoosa rivers, where dozens of
families were forced to evacuate.
   President Bush declared a federal disaster area Saturday in six
central Alabama counties.
   Some 9,000 residents in east-central Illinois at Champaign
remained without power after snow and ice storms knocked out lines
last week.
   In Washington state, road and utility crews were busy around
Puget Sound on Sunday as a record cold spell set in after storms
that dumped as much as 10 inches of snow on the region. The weather
was blamed for two traffic deaths since late last week, and caused
many power outages.
   The low temperature of 20 degrees Sunday morning at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport set a record for the date,
eclipsing the previous low of 21 in 1955.
   A mudslide early Sunday closed an 85-mile section of Interstate
80 from the Nevada border to Applegate, Calif. The eastbound side
of the highway reopened late Sunday.
   In Southern California, snow closed Interstate 5 through the
Grapevine, a route through the mountains linking the southern and
northern sections of the state, for several hours.
   A 18-mile strip of beaches just west of Los Angeles remained
closed at least until Tuesday because of a 7.6 million-gallon spill
of partly treated sewage into Santa Monica Bay. Officials at a
treatment plant had to release the sewage because of an overflow of
rain water.
   The bulk of the tempest was expected to move out of southern
California today, leaving behind some grateful farmers.
   ``We're short on water,'' said Doug Wagner, field supervisor for
a 400-acre strawberry farm near Oxnard. ``We welcome the rain.''
   Frost and rain damaged up to 20 percent of the strawberry crop,
Wagner said, estimating losses to Ventura County's strawberry,
citrus and avocado crops at $24 million.
   However, the precipitation did little to ease southern
California's fourth straight drought year. As of late Sunday, 2.51
inches of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center, bringing
the season's total to 5.43 inches, much below the 10.01 inches
normally received.

<HEAD>Arens' Acceptance Of German Unity Creates Furor In Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens has caused a storm
with his cautious embrace of German reunification. Cabinet
ministers demanded he be rebuked and newspaper editorials accuse
him of fostering ``a Fourth Reich.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir remained silent Monday in a
continuing debate that illustrates the dilemma posed for Israel by
the prospect of a reunited Germany.
   Israeli leaders cannot afford to alienate West Germany, the
staunchest supporter of the Jewish state in the European Community,
but they also must consider the emotions of the many Israelis whose
relatives were among the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis.
   ``We are still pondering the consequences'' of reunification,
senior Shamir aide Avi Pazner told The Associated Press on Monday.
``The prime minister has concerns about such a possibility, but has
not taken a stand opposing it.''
   Arens, a Shamir protege in the right-wing Likud bloc, started
the trouble last week by saying on a visit to Bonn that he had
confidence in the ``democratic traditions'' of West Germany and
viewed extending democracy to East Germany as a ``positive step.''
   After the criticism began, Arens pointed out that most of his
family perished in the Holocaust. Sunday's edition of the newspaper
Maariv quoted Arens, who was born in Lithuania, as saying: ``If I
wasn't foreign minister today, my feet wouldn't touch German soil.''
   Arens suggested, however, that Israel could not afford to
disrupt ties with West Germany and noted that Bonn had promised
help in blocking further European Community sanctions against
Israel. The sanctions were imposed to protest the treatment of
Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Before his comments in the West German capital, Arens said in
Israel that, if ``a united Germany is a democratic Germany, a
Germany that is fully conscious of the responsibility that it has
to the Jewish people ... then I don't think there is a danger to be
concerned about.''
   The text of the speech was sent to Israeli embassies around the
world to serve as a guide for diplomats.
   In the weekly Cabinet meeting Sunday, Environment Minister Roni
Milo, a confidant of Shamir, demanded that the government adopt a
resolution against German reunification.
   ``The generation that experienced the Holocaust is still
alive,'' Milo said on army radio. ``A united Germany should not be
supported by a Jewish state and a Jewish government.''
   Milo won support from Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi of the
rival center-left Labor Party.
   Most newspaper editorials on the subject were critical of Arens.
   ``No other country has welcomed in such an unreserved fashion
the first steps toward the formation of a Fourth Reich and a new
Hitler,'' Maariv said. ``Just the state of the Jews and its foreign
minister had to jump to the head of the line.''
   The mass circulation Yediot Ahronot described Arens as ``the one
who gave unification the Jewish kosher seal, offering the moral
boost that Chancellor Kohl needed.'' The reference was to Helmut
Kohl of West Germany.
   Shlomo Avineri, former director-general of the Foreign Ministry,
accused Shamir and Arens of ineptitude. He noted that, in a private
exchange of letters in December, Shamir angered Kohl by insisting
Jews had a right to be concerned about the recent developments in
Germany.
   ``When Shamir's letter ricocheted, Arens had to mend fences, to
give them (the Germans) a clean bill of health,'' Avineri said.
``Neither the Shamir outburst nor the Arens absolution is the
appropriate response.''
   Teddy Kollek, the liberal mayor of Jerusalem, was among the few
public figures who supported Arens.
   ``Frankly, we can't influence this at all, so why should we
pontificate on it?'' Kollek, who is 78 and was born in Vienna, said
of German reunification.
   ``Of course, there is an emotional issue, but you should not run
foreign policy on emotions,'' he told the AP.

   The body of a journalist for an
international news agency washed ashore on a beach Monday, police
said, two days after he was abducted at gunpoint from his home by
six men.
   The body of Richard de Zoysa, 33, was found at the Moratuwa
beach, just south of Colombo, police officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   De Zoysa's mother identified the body, which bore a gunshot
wound in the neck, the officials said. The reporter's body was
apparently thrown into the sea after he was shot, they said.
   De Zoysa, who workd for the Inter Press Service news agency, was
reported abducted from his home Saturday. Family members said at
least one of the men who took him away wore a police uniform.
   Police said the journalist was not arrested by their men. They
said they suspected he was taken by Sinhalese militants who have
been trying to overthrow the government.
   De Zoysa's family said a military official initially told them
the reporter was taken in for questioning. But later the family was
told he was not being held by the army.
   Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunga had denied the reporter
was in military custody but also said he doubted de Zoysa was
abducted by extremists.
   De Zoysa wrote several articles on the Sinhalese uprising for
Sri Lankan newspapers.
   Inter Press Service is headquartered in Rome and has
correspondents in many capitals around the world.
   Authorities blamed Sinhalese extremists of the People's
Liberation Front for the killings of three employees of the
state-owned television station last year.
   Since 1987, when the Sinhalese began their uprising, at least
6,000 people have been killed by the militants or by security
forces in retaliation.
   Sinhalese radicals began attacking the Sinhalese-dominated
government when it tried to make peace with Tamil rebels, who are
fighting for autonomy in the north and east. The extremists contend
the government has made too many concessions to the minority Tamils.
   Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, claim they are denied jobs and education by the Sinhalese,
who make up 75 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Economy, Like the Weather, is Topsy-Turvy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The weather isn't the only thing behaving
strangely this winter. The economy has been topsy-turvy as well.
   In just two months, December and January, many economists went
from predicting an impending economic downturn to believing that
the longest peacetime expansion in history has found another of its
nine lives.
   The new general consensus of moderate economic growth this year
is likely to be an important element in Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan's testimony before Congress Tuesday when he reveals
the Fed's policy targets for 1990. These targets will have a major
influence on interest rates and economic growth.
   Greenspan could be excused for expressing a certain amount of
perplexity about recent events.
   In December, the economic outlook was as bleak as the unusually
cold weather. Housing construction plunged; Christmas sales were
lackluster, and the overall economy, as measured by the gross
national product, turned in its worst showing in 3{ years.
   All that gloom prompted recession worries as economists feared
the impending demise of the seven-year-old economic recovery, an
expansion that has already lasted almost five times longer than
usual.
   But in January, the weather warmed and so did the economy.
Housing construction soared 29.6 percent, the biggest monthly
increase on record. Retail sales rebounded, largely on the strength
of a pickup in auto demand, and the economy produced 275,000 new
jobs, almost triple the December increase.
   The good news chased away the recession forecasts. Some analysts
now look for 3 percent annual growth in the January-March quarter,
six times the pace from October through December.
   ``The economy is doing a lot better than a lot of people thought
it would,'' said Michael K. Evans, head of a Washington forecasting
firm. ``Everything we have seen so far this year has been strong.''
   Part of the rebound is almost certainly weather-related. The
warmest January on record spurred business activity, which had been
depressed in December.
   But Evans and many of his colleagues believe that, even taking
account of January's weather, the economy is staging a modest
revival from the depressed fourth quarter.
   Greenspan, in an unusually candid comment, said that the chance
of a recession had diminished markedly since last spring and that
the fourth quarter's sluggish growth was likely to prove only a
``temporary hesistation.''
   Economists believe Greenspan will restate those views Tuesday
and are not looking for any immediate credit easing on the part of
the central bank, especially in light of current inflationary
pressures.
   In January, wholesale prices surged upward at an annual rate of
more than 24 percent, the fastest clip since the oil shock of the
early 1970s. Analysts are expecting a similarly worrisome increase
in January's consumer prices, which will be released Wednesday.
   While the inflation spike can be explained by temporary factors
such as the December freeze, which drove food prices higher,
economists said the Fed would still find the pace too troublesome
to ignore.
   ``The Fed does not want to be perceived as easing at a time when
inflation is accelerating, even if those inflationary pressures
were considered to be temporary,'' said David Jones, chief
economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer.
   That could set up a potential clash with the Bush
administration, which has been complaining over the last year that
the Greenspan-led Fed has not been aggressive enough in pushing
interest rates down to spur economic growth.
   In addition to releasing the Fed's 1990 targets for growth of
the money supply, which influences interest rates, Greenspan will
also reveal the Fed's economic forecast for the year.
   The Bush administration, in the forecast on which it based its
1991 budget, projected that the economy would expand at a 2.6
percent rate this year.
   The administration's forecast, which has been attacked as wildly
optimistic by Democrats in Congress, also calls for interest rates
to fall sharply.
   By forecasting faster growth and lower interest rates, the
administration was able to meet the 1991 budget deficit target
without having to raise taxes or make even steeper cuts in federal
programs.
   Many economists believe the central bank will stick to a
preliminary forecast made last July in which the bank estimated
that growth for 1990 would be in a weak range of between 1.5
percent to 2 percent.
   The Federal Reserve has a lot of influence on economic growth
through its power over interest rates. Economists believe a lower
growth forecast would be a warning that the Fed still believes
inflation is too high to loosen credit further, something the
administration would not like to hear in an election-year.
   ``The public comments from the administration will be coming hot
and heavy later on this year as Bush officials try to nudge the Fed
into an easier stance,'' Jones predicted.

   A Palestinian was found stabbed to death in a
West Bank refugee camp Monday, the fifth victim slain in a week on
suspicion of collaborating with Israeli authorities, Arab reports
said.
   Throughout the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians
staged a general strike to protest the immigration of Soviet Jews
to Israel and their possible settlement in the occupied territories.
   Most shops were closed and many workers stayed home under orders
from the PLO-backed leadership of the 26-month-old uprising against
Israel's occupation.
   ``The Soviet immigration to Palestine is a threat to world
peace,'' said a slogan spray-painted on a wall in the West Bank
city of Nablus. It was signed by the Palestinian Communist Party.
   PLO-backed uprising leaders also complained in a leaflet
ordering Monday's strike that Soviet immigration and settlement in
the occupied territories could hinder peace.
   While Israel is expecting up to 300,000 Soviet immmigrants in
the next three years because of liberalized Soviet exit policies,
Israeli leaders deny they are trying to settle the immigrants in
the territories.
   Also Monday, an Israeli official said U.S. and Israeli diplomats
were trying to arrange a meeting between Secretary of State James
A. Baker III and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to discuss Middle
East peace.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, the meeting
could be held Friday, with Arens stopping in Washington on his way
back from a visit to Mexico.
   Baker has proposed a joint meeting with Arens and Egyptian
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid as a step toward an
Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   In the al-Amari refugee camp near Ramallah, residents said
Hussein Hamad Abu Radwan, 35, an alleged collaborator, was slain
during the night after being kidnapped Sunday.
   He was stabbed to death and his body was dumped near the camp's
mosque, the residents said. The army confirmed the death but said
the circumstances were under police investigation.
   Radwan was the 187th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs since
the uprising began in December 1987, and the fifth killed in seven
days.
   In addition, 657 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians and 43 Israelis have been slain by
Palestinians during the uprising.
   Palestinians maintain that most victims are informers or
collaborate in other ways. The PLO has urged restraint in executing
alleged collaborators, ordering that suspects be tried and given a
chance to repent before being killed.
   In the Gaza Strip, 12 youths were wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with troops, including a 5-year-old girl who was hit in the
face with a rubber-coated steel pellet, hospital officials said.
   In the Palestinian village of A-Tur inside Jerusalem, a
19-year-old Palestinian was critically injured when he was hit in
the head with a stone as he drove through the village with a friend
and a tourist, Israel radio reported.

<HEAD>Kaifu's Hand Within Party Appears Stronger; Doi Will Fight On</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Japan, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu looked like a shaky
leader before the election, but he now is strengthened after his
party captured a strong majority in the lower house of Parliament,
analysts say.
   Also helped by Sunday's balloting, however, was Kaifu's main
opponent, Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi, whose party far
outpaced other opposition parties, moving from 83 seats before the
election to 136.
   Ms. Doi, 61, vowed to continue her struggles against the
conservative governing party _ and appeared to have ways to stir
trouble in Parliament.
   And the prime minister, breaking away from cautious comment,
declared: ``Now we have to carry out the promises we made, and I am
determined to lead the effort.''
   The strengthening of the two opposing leaders may seem like a
curious outcome to a hard-fought national election, but it derives
from both the relatively low expectations of Kaifu and the
fragmented nature of the opposition in Japan's political spectrum.
   Kaifu, 59, emerged from obscurity to become prime minister in
August when the Liberal Democrats were on the ropes from the
resignations of two prime ministers amid sex and money scandals,
and a big loss in the July election for the upper house of
Parliament.
   He came from a small faction in the party, had no personal
clout, and looked as if he could easily be the scapegoat if
anything went wrong.
   Six months later, Kaifu's personal clout is still to be
measured, but nothing has gone terribly wrong.
   Instead, with the 275 seats his Liberal Democratic Party won
outright and 14 conservative independents likely to join it in the
lower house, the party is not far behind the 295 seats it held
before the election.
   ``It's not going to be as easy to get rid of Kaifu as some of
the LDP leaders thought it would be,'' said Professor Gerald Curtis
of Columbia University.
   Curtis said at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan that
Kaifu's leadership will be tested soon in U.S.-Japan trade
negotiations, and it was possible he might misstep and become
vulnerable again.
   ``The chances that he will stay around for another year or year
and a half have surely improved,'' the Asia specialist said.
   If Kaifu stumbles, a more powerful figure within the Liberal
Democratic Party, former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe, is widely
thought to be preparing to try to replace him.
   Rei Shiratori, dean of the political science faculty at Tokai
University, told the same meeting he thought former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita was manipulating Kaifu from behind the scenes, and
if Kaifu became too strong, Takeshita would seek to remove him.
Shiratori said he thought Kaifu would last at least until December.
   Though the opposition fell far short of ousting the Liberal
Democrats in the lower house, it holds a majority in the upper
house, which, though less powerful, still must give its assent to
most bills passed by the lower house.
   The Socialists lead three centrist parties in that upper house
majority, which may be used to block essential government
legislation like enabling bills for the budget or measures to deal
with U.S.-Japan trade problems.
   Ms. Doi conceded that the opposition's main campaign theme of
demanding abolition of an unpopular 3 percent sales tax had failed,
but she declared the effort would continue.
   ``We'll carry out what we promised during the campaign, in
cooperation with other opposition parties,'' she said.
   The other parties, however, distrust the Socialists, and they
lost seats in the lower house while the Socialists advanced, giving
the centrists even more reason to try to rein in Ms. Doi's party.
   Curtis said the Socialists had done well in the election mainly
on Ms. Doi's appeal, which drew issue-oriented housewives into
party activism. But he said the party still needed to distance
itself from leftist dogma if it is to become a true alternative to
the Liberal Democrats, and he was pessimistic that she could change
the old party line.

   The United States is holding its own in the
race against Japan to develop the new superconductors, which could
be in commercial use within five years, a panel of experts said
Monday.
   Next year. the United States will for the first time launch
simple superconducting devices into space to determine how well the
devices survive.
   Communications equipment using superconductors would be much
lighter than conventional equipment and thus ideal for use in outer
space, where the costs of launching climb enormously as weight
increases, said Edward Mead of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. in
Wilmington, Del.
   ``The weight and size savings would be dramatic up there,'' he
said.
   Mead said the United States and Japan are neck-and-neck in the
race to develop the new superconductors, which were discovered in
January 1987.
   He spoke at the annual meeting of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.
   Conventional superconductors conduct electricity without
resistance at temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero, which
is equal to about 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The new
superconductors operate at the comparatively warmer temperatures of
liquid nitrogen, about 321 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
   That increases the potential applications of superconductors,
because liquid nitrogen is inexpensive and widely available in
industry.
   ``In space it may be possible to achieve that temperature
without refrigeration,'' Mead said.
   Japan is focusing its efforts on superconductors containing
bismuth, one of several classes of the so-called high-temperature
superconductors, Mead said. The Japanese believe the bismuth
compounds are the most promising, he said.
   ``If they're right, that would put them in a position far ahead
of us,'' he said. If they are wrong, however, ``they could all go
off the edge of a cliff.''
   Most of the support for the Japanese effort comes from industry.
In the United States, two-thirds of the support for
superconductivity research comes from the government, Mead said.
   That includes the support of the national weapons laboratories.
``For 40 years, they've been the most secret places in the world,
and now they're cooperating and sharing information,'' Mead said.
   Japan and the United States are each spending about $250 million
per year on superconductivity research, Mead said, far more than
any other nations.
   Paul Chu of the University of Houston said that superconducting
devices could be in use within five years in oil and mineral
exploration.
   Devices called superconducting quantum interference devices, or
SQUIDS, can detect very weak electromagnetic fields, Chu said.
   The new superconductors will make it possible to use these
devices to search for the telltale underground variations in
electromagnetic fields that indicate the presence of oil or
minerals, Chu said.
   Large applications, such as transmission lines and magnetically
levitated trains, are 10 to 15 years away, Chu said, and the
Japanese are ahead on those.
   Superconductors have unusual electrical properties that make
them ideal for use in radar and other military applications using
microwave communications, Mead said.
   ``For radar and microwave applications, I think the United
States is way ahead,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dubcek Has No Regrets about Not Fighting Invasion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, the Czechoslovak leader whose
experiment in ``socialism with a human face'' was crushed by Warsaw
Pact forces in 1968, said he had no regrets about his decision not
to resist the invasion.
   Dubcek also said he believed his colleagues gave him sedatives
during a showdown with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in an attempt
to curb his temper.
   ``I know that newsreel film shot at the time showed the people
angry and ready for any sacrifice. Perhaps our army also would have
been willing to stand up and fight. But I think that the decision
we made at the time was correct,'' Dubcek told Independent
Television in an interview to be aired Monday night.
   ``If we had resisted, which is certainly what the Soviets
expected, we would have drowned in blood,'' he said.
   Granada Television said it was Dubcek's first extended interview
with Western journalists in 20 years.
   The interview was conducted earlier this month by the producers
of ``Invasion,'' Granada's 1980 dramatization of the Warsaw Pact
action in August 1968 and the confrontation in Moscow the following
October between Dubcek and Brezhnev.
   The producers gave Dubcek a videotape of the program, and the
interview shows him reacting to various scenes. Comments by Dubcek,
now chairman of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, were translated
into English and dubbed into the program.
   Arrested after the invasion and taken to Moscow, Dubcek, then
first secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, said he told
Prime Minister Oldrich Cernik he would take no part in negotiations
intended to produce a written agreement with the Soviets on his
country's future.
   ``I told Cernik to tell the presidium that I had resigned,''
Dubcek said. His colleagues refused to accept his resignation.
   Dubcek said the Czechoslovaks did win three concessions from the
Soviets: they did not accept justification for the invasion, there
was no agreement to cancel Czechoslovak reforms, and there was no
acceptance of the right of any other Communist country to negotiate
Czechoslovakia's future.
   ``Although our delegation was successful in keeping these three
points out of the draft document, we had to compromise to avoid
bloodshed at home, and to make sure that all the members of our
delegation returned to Prague safely,'' he said.
   ``When my colleagues read out the draft to me before the signing
ceremony, I told them: `Look, you know me. You know my temperament.
I cannot guarantee that once I sit down and face them across a
table I'll just sign it. I could ruin everything. I may not be able
to control myself. That's the danger,''' Dubcek continued.
   ``They kept saying, `Calm down, calm down.' I know now they had
been giving me sedatives _ not injections, but tablets, vitamins
and other sedatives that would make me amenable and keep me happy.''
   The ``Invasion'' film claimed Dubcek was given injections.
   ``I don't know how many tablets I had,'' Dubcek said. ``I know I
look a pretty quiet man _ smiling, peaceful, looking more peaceful
than I feel.
   ``Anyway, the tablets simply didn't work.''
   The film showed Dubcek losing his temper, telling Brezhnev that
negotiations were a waste of time and that Soviet leaders were
blind to their own faults.
   ``They goose-stepped out, just like that (in the film) and left
us,'' Dubcek said.
   ``By standing up against them and adopting a position which I
knew they couldn't possibly accept, I set out to create an
atmosphere which would force them to break off, which is what
happened, as the film shows, they left the hall, the document was
unsigned, and a total split opened up,'' he said.
   Eventually, on Oct. 16, Dubcek and all but one of his colleagues
signed a treaty accepting the temporary stationing of Soviet troops
in Czechoslovakia.

   Police listened in on a telephone conversation
and traced a murder suspect to a Florida fast-food restaurant,
where he was arrested for the anti-gay slaying of a mentally ill
New York man.
   The suspect, Philip Sarlo, was wanted in the Jan. 22 death of
James Zappalorti, who was stabbed to death on a Staten Island
beach, allegedly by two men who believed him to be homosexual.
   Sarlo had telephoned someone in New York on Sunday, and that
person notified police. When Sarlo called back an hour and a half
later, officers were listening in, according to a police
spokeswoman, Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   Sarlo revealed where he was calling from _ a Burger King
restaurant in Ocala, Fla. Police there were notified and made the
arrest.
   New York detectives were to go to Ocala, in north central
Florida, to bring back Sarlo, 26. Another man, Michael Taylor, 20,
previously was charged in the slaying of Zappalorti, 41.
   The killing drew protests from civil rights and homosexual
groups and vows from politicians that such crimes would not be
tolerated. Zappalorti's parents have said he was not homosexual.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Return With American Experiment</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two cosmonauts ended a 22-week mission Monday that
included the first American experiment aboard the space station
Mir, floating out of the clear blue sky onto the glistening snow of
the Kazakhstan steppe.
   State-run television broadcast a recording of the descent module
of a Soyuz TM-8 capsule, its white parachute casting a shadow in
the vast snowy expanse.
   Mission commander Alexander S. Viktorenko and flight engineer
Alexander A. Serebrov touched down near Arkalyk in Kazakhstan
republic, 1,080 miles southeast of Moscow, the Tass news agency
said.
   Viktorenko, 42, and his 45-year-old crewmate were reported in
good health, Tass said.
   The TV report showed the cosmonauts smiling as they sat covered
with blankets in the minus 26-degree Fahrenheit temperatures at the
remote landing site. They sipped hot drinks as well as champagne on
a plane flight later Monday to Star City, the cosmonaut training
center near Moscow.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov blasted off Sept. 5 on a mission to Mir
that featured dozens of scientific experiments and the successful
testing of a ``space motorcycle,'' a one-man vehicle designed for
repairing satellites, servicing the Buran space shuttle, and
rescuing cosmonauts in distress. They tested the motorcycle during
two of five spacewalks.
   A replacement crew, Anatoly Solovyov and Alexander Balandin,
flew to the space platform Feb. 11 and will remain aboard for about
six months to continue the experiments.
   Among the 200 pounds of scientific cargo Viktorenko and Serebrov
brought back were protein crystals exposed to weightlessness in an
American experiment created by Payload Systems Inc. The company was
the first authorized by the U.S. Commerce Department to fly
experiments aboard the Soviet space station.
   The crystals, brought to space Dec. 20, will be shipped to the
United States and analyzed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory
next month, according to Payload officials.
   Other research completed by the returning cosmonauts included
experiments in geophysics, astrophysics, medical biology and
biotechnology, Tass said.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov were the fifth crew to live for an
extended period aboard Mir, the primary building block of the
Soviet orbital station launched in February 1986.
   ``During their 166-day stay in weightlessness, the crew
underwent regular medical checkups, providing new data about man's
working abilities and functional state during different stages of
the flight,'' Tass said.
   The 20-ton platform, designed to be permanently manned, remained
empty for four months in 1989 to cut costs and to give Soviet
scientists a chance to prepare two add-on modules for Mir.
   One of the modules, the Kvant-2 astrophysics laboratory, was
activated and successfully tested by the two cosmonauts, Tass said.

<HEAD>Daughter, Sister of Governors Seeks California Treasurer Post</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WILLIAMS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kathleen Brown, daughter of California's
builder governor and sister of its solar governor, is trying to
project her own image as she runs for state treasurer.
   For 29 of the last 39 years, a Brown has held one of the state's
top political offices.
   Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown Sr. was attorney general from 1951
through 1958 and governor from 1959 through 1966. Edmund G.
``Jerry'' Brown Jr. was secretary of state from 1971 through 1974,
governor from 1975 through 1982 and currently is chairman of the
California Democratic Party.
   Now it's Kathleen, 44, a lawyer who has been described as
combining her father's political charm with her brother's brains.
   Being related to two of the most well-known politicians in the
state brings Ms. Brown the instant recognition a politician needs,
along with instant identification, not always desirable, with the
very different accomplishments and problems of her father and her
brother.
   Her father, a classic gregarious politician, built freeways,
universities and water projects, and lost his third term bid to
Ronald Reagan in 1966. Her brother, a cerebral, Jesuit-trained
visionary, stressed alternate energy, conservation and mass transit
until he lost his 1982 U.S. Senate race to Republican Pete Wilson.
   Her task now is to take that recognition as far as politically
beneficial _ and move beyond it to create her own political persona.
   She has several ready lines she uses when confronted with
questions about her father and brother:
   ``I have three marvelous assets: I am a woman, I am a Democrat
and I am a Brown. The liability side of my balance sheet includes
the fact that I am a woman running for treasurer, I am a Democrat
and I am a Brown.''
   ``I'm not my father and I'm not my brother. I'm a Brown, but I'm
a different shade of Brown, my own shade of Brown.''
   The state treasurer was once an obscure functionary, until the
late Jesse Unruh realized its potential and began organizing other
states to use their power in the financial markets. The treasurer
not only invests the $19 billion in tax funds that isn't being used
at any given moment, but also sells the billions in bonds that
build everything from prisons to sewage plants.
   Ms. Brown is unopposed for the Democratic nomination in the June
primary, but in November will have to face one of two Republicans
who each have their own formidable connections. Like Ms. Brown,
neither has run for statewide office before.
   The incumbent is Thomas Hayes, a former legislative auditor who
registered as a Republican only when Gov. George Deukmejian
appointed him to the vacancy created by Unruh's death. Hayes has
untested political skills but has all of the campaign apparatus of
Deukmejian, who is retiring from politics after this term.
   The other GOP candidate is Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S.
treasurer and sister of conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan.
   In 1987, after Ms. Brown moved back to California from New York
with her family, Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley appointed her to the
five-member Los Angeles Board of Public Works. She resigned last
summer to campaign full-time.
   Hayes criticizes Ms. Brown as a politician without his
experience in managing and overseeing state finances. Ms. Buchanan
criticizes both Ms. Brown and Hayes for holding New York
fund-raisers to collect contributions from investment bankers and
says she will not accept money from firms that do business with the
treasurer's office.
   Ms. Brown calls Hayes a technocrat and Ms. Buchanan an ideologue.
   She won't say which Republican she'd prefer facing in November.
Instead, she recalls her father and advisers discussing his run for
a third term in 1966 when he was afraid he would have to run
against a popular San Francisco Republican. The advisers preferred
``a retired actor from Southern California, an easy target.''
   ``I learned my lesson,'' she said.

   A man fell to his death at Angel
Falls, the world's highest waterfall, when he jumped from a
helicopter to parachute near the water and the chute did not open,
the Venpres news agency said Monday.
   The state news agency identified the dead man as Jean Marc
Boivin, 39, and said he was a mountain climber from France.
   According to Venpres, Boivin had gone to the southern region of
Guayana to visit the ``tepuys''_ the flat-topped mountains near the
falls _ and parachute parallel to the 3,212-foot-high cascade, a
risky stunt that has been carried out several times.
   Boivin and a companion, Katherine Kohl, jumped from a chartered
helicopter. Boivin was killed when his parachute did not open, and
Kohl was injured when the wind slammed her against the mountain
wall, Venpres said.

<HEAD>Former Justice Minister Pleads Innocent to Tipping Husband</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former justice minister who was
forced to resign after being the only woman to reach a Cabinet post
pleaded innocent Monday to charges she illegally tipped her husband
about a drug money probe.
   Elisabeth Kopp testified before the Supreme Court on the opening
day of the first criminal proceedings against a government minister
in Swiss history.
   Kopp, her former personal assistant and another ministry aide
are charged with breaking official secrets laws. If convicted, they
face jail terms of up to three years.
   Kopp resigned Jan. 12, 1989, under political pressure. A special
investigator's report later faulted her leadership of the Justice
Ministry, which she had headed since 1984.
   Kopp, 53, was in line to become the first female president in
Switzerland, where women gained the right to vote in national
affairs only in 1971. The daughter of a former head of
Switzerland's National Bank, she rose to prominence in the
center-right Radical Party.
   In court, she admitted calling her husband, Zurich lawyer and
businessman Hans Kopp, in October 1988, and urging him to break
ties with a currency dealing firm under scrutiny in Switzerland's
biggest drug money laundering probe. Kopp resigned his post as a
board member at the Lebanese-controlled Shakarchi Trading the same
day.
   But in her testimony, Mrs. Kopp repeated her claim that she was
innocent of wrongdoing because she believed the tip that helped her
husband had come from banking circles, not from internal government
information. She said she received it from a personal assistant who
did not give the source.
   Swiss authorities have not filed charges against Shakarchi.
   Special prosecutor Joseph-Daniel Piller dismissed Kopp's
argument, charging she illegally passed internal information,
regardless of its source.
   ``I never thought for a second that it could be a violation of
official secrecy,'' Kopp told a five-man jury of the Supreme Court,
which is convened only for serious federal cases.
   Kopp, who appeeared calm, said she briefly phoned her husband
but told him to get details from her aide, Katharina Schoop.
   Schoop reiterated in court that Renate Schwob, a ministry
employee who is the trial's third defendant, showed her
non-classified reports containing the Shakarchi suspicions and
urged her to draw Kopp's attention to the case.
   Top Justice Ministry officials will testify when proceedings
resume Tuesday.
   The trial climaxes an affair that has shaken the usually stable
world of Swiss politics for more than a year and provoked a crisis
of public confidence.
   A new political furor was fueled by a parliamentary inquiry into
the affair that also reported authorities kept secret police files
on 900,000 Swiss residents and organizations.

<HEAD>Azerbaijanis Storm Out of Legislative Session on Ethnic Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The entire Azerbaijani delegation to the national
legislature stormed out of a session Monday after the Soviet
defense minister refused to accept blame for deaths in a military
crackdown on the uprising in the southern republic, sources said.
   The dramatic walkout by the approximately 15-member delegation
occurred in a closed-door Kremlin session of the Supreme Soviet
called to discuss the Azerbaijani-Armenian dispute over
Nagorno-Karabakh and ethnic clashes resulting from it.
   Although reporters were barred from the seven-hour session and
it was not televised as most sessions are, two participants _
Vitautas A. Statulyavicus of Lithuania and Arkady N. Murashev of
Moscow _ gave details in telephone interviews.
   Deputies decided to close the session, chaired by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, to reporters because of the sensitive nature
of the topic, debate on which has sparked clashes in the past.
   Murashev said the Azerbaijanis walked out after Defense Minister
Dmitri T. Yazov ``insulted the Azerbaijani delegation.'' According
to the deputy, Yazov said that when the Azerbaijani delegates
discussed victims of the nationalist uprising, they blamed the
army. Yazov contended Azerbaijani extremists were to blame.
   Soviet troops stormed into Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, on
Jan. 20, a week after Azerbaijanis attacked ethnic Armenian
residents. Official reports say 139 were killed in the city since
the troops moved in, including 106 civilians, 28 troops and five
policemen.
   About 17,000 troops were committed to Baku, and many remain to
help enforce a curfew imposed as part of a state of emergency.
Azerbaijani activists and politicians have been demanding the
troops be withdrawn and say their introduction in Baku was
unnecessary and cost lives.
   Before they walked out, Azerbaijani delegates repeated the
demand that troops be withdrawn and reaffirmed their republic's
control over Nagorno-Karabakh, the district at the heart of the
dispute with the republic of Armenia, Statulyavicus said.
   Armenian delegates, however, pressed their republic's demand for
control of the district, the Lithuanian deputy said.
   He said Gorbachev told the deputies the law, which since 1923
has made Nagorno-Karabakh part of Azerbaijan, must be preserved.
   The Soviet president supported a proposal for Armenian and
Azerbaijani delegates to begin negotiations on their dispute and
for their republics to draft a treaty on Nagorno-Karabakh, but
Murashev said the Azerbaijanis rejected the proposal.
   The deputies agreed to return to the topic again in a few days
and vote on a resolution on the dispute. Previous Supreme Soviet
legislation has failed to calm tempers in the Caucasus, where the
two republics are located.
   In the Soviet republic of Tadzhikistan, also the site of ethnic
violence against Armenians on Feb. 12-13, the prosecutor's office
has begun criminal proceedings against 20 people said to be
``instigators'' of the disorders, according to Tadzhik Interior
Minister Mamadayez Navzhuvanov.
   Navzhuvanov said the 20 were accused of attempted murder,
pogroms, arson and attacks on ambulances, according to a dispatch
from the Tadzhik capital of Dushanbe carried by the Tass news
agency.
   Navzhuvanov, who also is the military commandant of Dushanbe,
was quoted as saying that since a state of emergency was declared
in the city, residents turned in 457 firearms, 16,000 rounds of
ammunition and 12 firebombs. However, the Tass dispatch said, many
weapons remain in the hands of militants.
   Attacks against Armenians were carried out in the city when
rumors circulated that Armenian refugees from the Azerbaijan unrest
were being given much sought-after apartments in Dushanbe.
Officials have denied that Armenians were being given preferential
treatment.

   Nearly 5,000 people who spent time
in prison for their political views have established a federation
to seek rehabilitation of all political prisoners.
   The Confederation of Political Prisoners was formed over the
weekend in Prague, the daily Svobodne Slovo said Monday.
   According to the memorandum issued by the Confederation, more
than 100,000 people were sentenced to prison for their political
beliefs between 1948 and 1953, with the sentences of some 40,000
exceeding 10 years.
   In the same period of time, 178 people were executed and some
8,000 were tortured to death, shot as they fled or died in prison,
the former prisoners said in their memorandum, which was made
available to The Associated Press.
   A total of 4,829 people were sentenced for political crimes in
the years between 1968 and 1989, the memorandum said.

<HEAD>Poetry And Politics Mix at Jerusalem's First Poetry Festival</HEAD>

   Sami Alkilani stood to recite in his native
Arabic the lines he composed while imprisoned in a tent in the
Negev desert.
   ``We fall on the ground, on the bosom of sands, like an endless
seed looking for water,'' he read.
   The next reader was an Israeli author who dedicated his poem to
a friend killed on the Suez Canal in the Arab-Israeli war of 1973.
   That juxtaposition was only the beginning of a mix of politics
and poetry at the first Jerusalem Poetry Festival, which brought
together 30 poets from 24 foreign countries, and languages
including Hebrew, Arabic, Russian and Japanese.
   The weeklong festival opened Saturday. It also featured 30
Israeli poets and public readings and panels such as ``The Poet in
Exile'' and ``The Poet as a Revolutionary.''
   Even before its opening, the festival _ organized by Jerusalem's
official cultural center, Mishkenot Shaananim _ took a political
turn.
   The Hebrew daily Al Hamishmar termed it ``Poetry in the Shadow
of Stones,'' referring to the 26-month-old Palestinian uprising
against Israeli rule of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Other newspapers recalled that an attempt to hold the festival
in 1988 failed after a chief organizer, Israeli poet Natan Zach,
resigned to protest Israel's handling of the rebellion.
   This year's festival featured three Palestinians from the West
Bank: Asad El Asad, Ali El Khalili and Alkilani, who was jailed for
18 months in the without trial in the rebellion. At least 650
Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians and
about 40 Israelis have been slain by Palestinians during the
uprising.
   In a statement Monday, the Palestinians said they agreed to
appear at the festival because they considered ``our sufferings as
poets as part of the larger sufferings of our people.'' They asked
fellow poets to support their struggle for independence.
   Festival spokeswoman Nurit Banai said one poet, Egyptian Edward
Said, was denied a permit to come to Israel by Egypt, the only Arab
country at peace with Israel. But Monday's Jerusalem Post quoted
Said as saying he canceled for professional reasons.
   Others who canceled included Czeslav Milosz, the Polish Nobel
laureate who was too ill to attend, and South African exile Breyten
Breytenbach.
   Ms. Banai said Breytenbach, who lives in France, was granted a
rare visa to his homeland. ``He wanted to go before they change
their mind,'' she said.
   Festival director Yael Amzalak said some poets came after recent
political changes in their countries allowed their work to be
published openly for the first time.
   These included Gennadi Aigi, Bella Akhmadulina and Yevgeny Rejn
of the Soviet Union, Bei Dao of China and Miroslav Holub of
Czechoslovakia.

   A clandestine countdown advanced
smoothly Monday toward a fiery pre-dawn liftoff Thursday of space
shuttle Atlantis with five military astronauts and a spy satellite.
   ``You wouldn't believe how smooth it is,'' said NASA spokeswoman
Lisa Malone. ``The count picked up right on time without a hitch
Sunday night and we've had no problems.''
   Shuttle forecasters said the weather outlook was 60 percent
favorable for a launch Thursday. They said the main concern was an
advancing cold front that could bring low clouds and rain into the
area.
   Malone could not reveal the exact status of the countdown
because of the classified nature of the mission, the sixth
dedicated to the Defense Department in 34 shuttle flights.
   The count will be made public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff on Thursday. Officials have said only that the
launch will take place between midnight and 4 a.m., but sources
close to the program report Atlantis is to take off at 1 a.m.
   Once Atlantis is in orbit, there will be a news blackout on what
is happening until an hour before the shuttle returns to Earth. The
flight is expected to last four days.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
shuttle's payload is a 37,300-pound, $500 million satellite
designed to take high-resolution reconnaissance photos and
eavesdrop on military and diplomatic communications in much of the
world.
   They said the satellite will be launched into a high-inclination
orbit that will cover most of the Soviet Union, including northern
areas not previously flown over by shuttle-launched spy satellites.
The Soviets have heavy concentrations of naval ships and submarines
and several missile bases in the far north.
   The satellite, known by the code name AFP-731, and other
reconnaissance spacecraft will be important in verifying whether
the Soviets are complying with U.S.-Soviet disarmament agreements
now being forged.
   The Soviets have their own spy satellites to monitor U.S.
compliance.
   The five astronauts who will fly the Atlantis mission reviewed
their flight plan Monday and went to bed about noon. They have been
adjusting their hours to match the sleep time they will have in
space, from about noon to 8 p.m.
   The crew is commanded by Navy Capt. John O. Creighton. The
others are Air Force Col. John H. Casper the pilot, and mission
specialists Marine Lt. Col. David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col.
Richard M. Mullane and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre J. Thuot.

   Painter Norman Rockwell's only known nude
portrait has been bought for $50,000 by an Oakland County man.
   Tom Sullivan said he will meet with the portrait owner, who also
is the subject of ``The Manapessa,'' also called ``Portrait of Miss
Jackie Wells.''
   Ms. Wells, a former art model, is now a 61-year-old secretary in
Detroit who posed for Rockwell in August 1958 while a student at
Wayne State University. Rockwell gave her the painting after
completing it.
   Sullivan, of Bloomfield Township, said he was drawn to the
uniqueness of the portrait.
   ``I'm surprised I got it for that price,'' said Sullivan, who
said after Sunday's auction he was a first-time art buyer.
   Auctioneer Joseph Walker said DuMouchelles Art Galleries
expected up to $60,000 for the portrait. He said the nude painting
was smaller and not a typical Rockwell piece that would attract
serious Rockwell collectors. That kept the bidding lower, he said.
   The oil painting is 37 inches by 14 inches.
   Sullivan's wife, Gail, said the couple will offer the painting
to the Detroit Institute of Arts for public exhibition before
displaying it in their home.

<TEXT>
   Michel Aoun has told the Christian
militia challenging his supremacy to give up its east Beirut
strongholds in 72 hours or face an all-out assault, sources close
to the rebel general said Monday.
   They said Aoun informed Samir Geagea when a cease-fire began
Saturday that Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia had until late
Tuesday to withdraw from Beirut port and the nearby Karantina
quarter.
   Lebanese Forces officials declined comment but said Geagea was
prepared to negotiate differences with Aoun.
   Late Monday, a three-man Christian mediation committee that
arranged the truce Saturday said Aoun and Geagea had accepted a
six-point agreement to strengthen the cease-fire.
   There was little sign of decreased tension. Both sides
reinforced their positions and Christian civilians continued
fleeing areas where fighting appeared possible.
   The sources close to Aoun, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the general would not leave Geagea's forces intact to mount
another challenge.
   A statement from the mediation committee said, however, that the
combatants agreed to forming a ``national authority'' led by Aoun
within Christian territory while leaving the Lebanese Forces
intact. That would leave the question of military supremacy
unsettled.
   Aoun commands about 19,000 men and attacked Geagea on Jan. 30 in
an attempt to establish sole authority over the 310-sqare-mile
enclave north and east of Beirut where 1 million Christians live.
He now controls most of east Beirut, the mountains on the enclave's
eastern flank and part of the coast.
   Geagea's militia, which has about 6,000 regulars and several
thousand reservists, holds the coastal areas of Kesrouan and
Batroun north of Beirut and pockets in the capital.
   His headquarters is in Karantina next to the Ashrafiyeh
district, a militia stronghold that has held out against Aoun's
forces.
   One source said: ``The general is determined to capture
Ashrafiyeh and Karantina to get to the port. He'll settle for
nothing less than having Beirut port to resupply his forces.''
   Lebanese Forces militiamen captured Beirut port early in the
battle, leaving Aoun with no harbor through which to receive
supplies by sea. Geagea holds Jounieh and Byblos, the only major
ports in Christian territory.
   ``He's giving the Lebanese Forces time to pull out of Ashrafiyeh
and Karantina peacefully,'' one of the sources said. ``Otherwise,
he'll uproot them by force. The assault will be very bloody. If
Geagea approves, the truce will hold. If he doesn't, the clashes
will resume.''
   An-Nahar, a respected Beirut newspaper, reported Monday that
Geagea had flown to Paris to meet with Christian members of the
Lebanese Parliament. The report could not be confirmed
independently.
   Police said the cease-fire, the 12th of the 3-week-old battle,
had allowed Christians in the enclave to start repairing homes and
businesses.
   Many remained wary, however.
   ``They've seen many cease-fires collapse,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations. ``Many
areas are still mined and fortifications have not been removed.''
   An army sergeant, his wife and five children were killed when
their car hit a mine in the Tahwita district, police said Monday
night. That raised the toll to at least 667 people killed and 1,872
wounded in the worst fighting between Christians since the
Moslem-Christian civil war began in April 1975.
   Police estimated property damage at $750 million.
   Statements from both sides Monday urged employees of water,
electricity and telephone companies to start repairing damage to
the systems. The police spokesman said debris and burned cars were
being removed from streets.
   Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Catholics, the main Christian sect
in Lebanon that has dominated the government, army and judiciary
since independence from France in 1943.
   President Elias Hrawi, a Maronite elected president by
Parliament in November, dismissed Aoun as military commander but
the general refused to step aside and does not recognize Hrawi as
president. Hrawi has Syrian support and a mandate to implement a
peace agreement Aoun rejects.
   Fighting between Aoun and Geagea began when Geagea refused the
general's demand that he disband the Lebanese Forces, the largest
Christian militia in Lebanon.
   Geagea recognizes Hrawi but has not taken a public position on
the peace plan. Aoun rejects the plan because it does not set a
timetable for withdrawal from Lebanon of Syria's 40,000 soldiers,
with whom Aoun fought a six-month artillery war that ended in
September.
   The Syrians have been in Lebanon since 1976, a year after the
civil war began, under a peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
Aoun calls them an occupation force.
   A Christian radio station, Voice of Lebanon, quoted a source
close to Geagea on Monday as saying the militia chieftain was ready
``to begin talks ... based on mutual respect and safeguarding
political freedoms.''
   ``The Lebanese cause needs the two guns together and eliminating
one will weaken the other,'' the source quoted Geagea as saying.
   A source close to Aoun responded: ``There can only be a solution
by unifying the gun and not by talking about two guns.''

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, returned

Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Bush met with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft in the

   He made no public appearances. The Bushes returned to Washington

   Clancy was an invited guest at the White House to watch the

said deputy press secretary Stephen Hart.
   Bush was to meet on Tuesday with Vaclav Havel, the new president
of Czechoslovakia, and the first of the new Eastern European

   There was free cake Monday in George,
Washington, for President's Day.
   The town of about 300 people swells to more than triple that
population twice a year: President's Day and Independence Day, when
there's free cherry pie.
   This year the cake was frosted in a quilt pattern with a
likeness of the first president in the center, said Carol Michael,
president of the Community Hall where the festivities are held.
   The cake was baked and decorated by the Georgettes, a community
group in this town in the center of Washington, about 120 miles
from Seattle.

   Dental work is an art form for Don
Woods, a dental technician whose sideline is creating tiny
paintings on false teeth, bridges and crowns.
   Working with brightly colored dental stains, Woods paints on
ceramic used to create false teeth. The image later is baked
permanently into the tiny bits of porcelain.
   He did a baby grand piano on a tooth he made for Linda Urban,
26, of Pekin.
   ``I'm a pianist and so is my husband,'' Ms. Urban said. ``I
needed some bridge work done and I thought it was a cute idea to
have a piano painted on my tooth. It looks like an actual little
piano.''
   Woods, 32, is a walking gallery of his own work, sporting a tiny
painted bridge that spans three of his teeth.
   ``It's a bridge on a bridge,'' he said. ``I thought that was
kind of ironic.''

<HEAD>Solidarity Candidate Defeats Ethnic German In Heated Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Solidarity-backed candidate defeated an
ethnic German in a parliament by-election that provoked ethnic
sentiments in southwestern Poland, officials announced Monday.
   Dorota Simonides, a professor specializing in the folklore of
the Silesia region, received 258,138 votes, or 67 percent, to
defeat Henryk Krol, a leader of the ethnic German community in the
province of Opole, said a dispatch by the state PAP news agency.
   Krol received 124,498 votes, or 32 percent, PAP reported.
   Turnout in Sunday's voting was 55 percent, compared with 31.4
percent attendance during the first round on Feb. 4.
   In the two weeks since Krol finished first and Mrs. Simonides
second in a four-candidate field, forcing Sunday's runoff, emotions
have run high in the industrialized Silesia region historically
contested by Poland and Germany.
   Ethnic Germans comprise about one-third of the province's 1
million residents.
   Mrs. Simonides rejected any campaign appeals based on the ethnic
difference between her and Krol, but it appeared that she inherited
the support of the two eliminated candidates, who had made such
appeals.
   ``I will be a senator of all residents of the Opole province,
and thus also of the German minority,'' she told Polish television
after her victory.
   ``I would like to help to integrate, spread agreement and real
reconciliation,'' she said.
   The campaign was also waged against the backdrop of the planned
reunification of Germany, a prospect that raises bitter memories of
past German aggressions.
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, seeking an ironclad
guarantee of Poland's current border with Germany, has asked to
participate at planned unification negotiations.
   Opole province is part of the nearly one-third of modern Poland
composed of lands forfeited by Germany after World War II,
compensating for an even larger Polish territory taken by the
Soviets on the eastern border.
   Polish concern was evident during the campaign. The
pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza reported that one campaign leaflet
called for being ``alert at the moment that the historic German
enemy is raising his head.''
   Across Opole, graffiti proclaimed, ``Krol to Germany, Germans to
Germany,'' and ``Krol _ fascist,'' the newspaper said.
   Opole province, 190 miles southwest of Warsaw, has the highest
concentration of enthic Germans in the country, and Krol and his
father, Jan Krol, were founders of the area's German Minority
Cultural-Social Society.
   There are believed to be up to 1 million ethnic Germans among
Poland's population of 38 million.
   Communist officials for decades denied that any German minority
remained in Poland. That changed with recent efforts by the
Solidarity-led Mazowiecki government to assure rights to ethnic
minorities, along with a visit to the region in November by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   There are no ethnic Germans among the 460 members of the Sejm,
the lower house of Parliament, or the 100 freely elected members of
the Senate.
   Sunday's election was to fill the Senate seat left vacant by the
recent death of the incumbent.

   Barbara Bush, dog Millie in tow,
went looking for holiday bargains Monday, taking a brisk 1{-mile
stroll to a favorite clothes shop.
   Mrs. Bush strode purposefully in icy morning air along the
oceanfront road from the family compound to Carla's Corner near the
village center, where several dozen people gathered outside,
including a camera crew and a few reporters who had chanced upon
her.
   ``Haven't you ever seen an old lady walk a dog before,'' she
quipped to a photographer who took a photo of her greeting a woman
and child standing on a snowy sidewalk.
   The first lady, who is known to resent press scrutiny of what
she considers her private life, also firmly told a reporter,
``Goodbye,'' as she entered Carla's. ``You go on down into town,''
she added.
   She was accompanied by an aide and a small security detail as
she took advantage of the chance to exercise a public spontaneity
that is almost impossible within the confines of the White House.
   Later, Mrs. Bush chatted with reporters aboard Air Force One on
the trip back to Washington.
   On the president's suggestion the day before that he might
invite Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to their Maine home, Mrs.
Bush said that Bush had not told her about it.
   But, she added, `You know me. Anybody he asks _ I'll be nice
to.''
   On another subject, she said that the $50,000 rug that former
President Reagan had put in the Oval Office, and which Bush had
taken out so one he liked could be put in its place, would likely
be given on loan to the Reagan Library when it is opened.
   On her morning walk, Mrs. Bush walked past Carla's Corner
window, which advertised sales with savings of 50 percent to 60
percent. But the spring outfit Mrs. Bush chose, a black and white
two-piece dress, was not on sale, said storekeeper Lee Walker. Mrs.
Bush, dressed in jeans and tennis shoes, did not want to try it on,
so she took it to try at home before buying it, she said.
   Store owner Carla Perkins said Mrs. Bush and her family were
regular customers.
   When Mrs. Bush came out, she seemed exasperated by the cameras,
and good naturedly motioned them away.
   She declined to answer questions about her purchases, but did
comment on dog Millie's health when asked.
   ``George is convinced she's sick, but it really is because she's
jealous of her son,'' a big, bounding dog who belongs to one of
Bush's sons and frequently visits the White House, Mrs. Bush said.
   ``It's more in the mind than the body,'' she said of Millie's
listlessness.
   After letting some local children pet Millie, Mrs. Bush took off
at a jog with her aides.
   However, she decided after a short distance to get in the car
and ride back to Walker's Point, commenting that her entourage and
the accompanying car and photographers were likely to cause a
traffic accident on the two-lane road.
   She also stopped on the way into town at the stately old
Nonantum Hotel, to see her aide's room in the newly added wing.
Mrs. Bush, who spends every summer in Kennebunkport with her
husband, said she had never seen the new part.

<TEXT>
   Ingvar Carlsson, who has led a
caretaker administration since resigning as prime minister last
week, was asked Monday to form a new government.
   The speaker of Parliament, Thage G. Peterson, turned to Carlsson
after opposition leader Carl Bildt of the Moderate Party declared
himself unable to assemble a center-right coalition.
   After meeting with the speaker, Carlsson said he had been given
until Wednesday evening to determine whether he could form a new
Cabinet.
   His minority Social Democratic government resigned Thursday
after Parliament defeated his proposals for a two-year wage and
price freeze intended to combat inflation.
   Carlsson said his hopes of forming a new government hinged on
building support for a new economic program, but he did not say how
his proposals would be modified.
   Bildt said Peterson gave him the chance Saturday to form a
non-socialist coalition, but he could not put together a
parliamentary majority or working minority.
   The Social Democrats, who hold 156 of Riksdag's 349 seats,
governed with the support of the Communists, who have 21 seats. The
Communists joined the center-right opposition against Carlsson's
economic package, arguing that it would hurt people with low
incomes.
   Under the constitution, Peterson may assign the task of forming
a government four times, then elections must be held. The Social
Democrats have been out of power only six years since 1932.
   Finance Minister Kjell-Olof Feldt resigned from the caretaker
government Monday. He was the architect of the economic recovery
that began in 1982, and in recent years won respect from
businessmen for reducing the regulation of banking and financial
markets.
   Feldt said Parliament had blocked him from imposing the tight
fiscal policies he felt necessary to stop a wage-cost spiral that
threatened exports, and that his own party sometimes did not
support him.

<HEAD>Lessons in Bureaucracy at New York Board of Ed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Question: How many Board of Education
bureaucrats does it take to change a light bulb?
   Answer: Fill this out in triplicate and check back in a month.
   That's the level of absurdity facing new schools Chancellor
Joseph Fernandez as he delves into bureaucracy and red tape at the
New York education headquarters.
   According to the Daily News, hundreds of teachers received a
memo last year titled, ``Proper Handwashing.''
   In seven easy steps, the teachers were reminded that ``running
water is necessary to carry away dirt and debris,'' advised to use
``a circular motion and friction, for 15 to 30 seconds,'' and told
to ``discard paper towels in receptacle.''
   Fernandez, faced with a system of 950,000 students, 1,000
buildings and a backlog of 33,000 repair requests, asked
departments what their urgent needs were.
   The director of the Office of Professional Development and
Leadership Training said her top priority was a ``Concretizing
Mission.''
   A what?
   ``Capacity building of personnel resources,'' the director
wrote, ``and personal abilities of central board of education,
districts and school (sic) to facilitate generating vehicles to
assist schools in nurturing student achievement ...''
   Oh.
   The official, who was not identified in the News story, showed
off her abilities as an empire builder when she proposed the
creation of a Coalition of Professional Developers to provide help
to the schools.
   The coalition, she said, would be assisted by District Support
Teams. Eventually, the school board could create an Academy of
Learning, Teaching, Supervising and Management that would consist
of four institutes, including an Institute for Intellectual and
Creative Development.
   The bottom line: a modest $2 million would pay for the entire
lot _ the CPD, the DSTs, the ALTSM and the IICD, as they might
eventually be known.
   Another priceless piece of paperwork came from Public School 140
in the Bronx, whose principal decided to ease congestion in the
school office.
   Her solution: ``Request Form for Permission to Come Behind the
Counter in the Main Office.'' That form was discontinued last year
after being ridiculed by the teachers union.

<TEXT>
   Israel raided Palestinian bases near the
port of Sidon Monday, saying the bases were used to organize
attacks on Israeli troops. One person was killed and three wounded
in two air raids, Lebanese police said.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said its warplanes attacked
bases used by the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Marxist PLO faction, near the village of Kafr Jarah, four miles
east of Sidon.
   It said the bases were destroyed and all the aircraft returned
safely from the first attack, about 35 miles north of Israel's
border. There was no immediate confirmation from Israel of the
second attack.
   Police said that in the first assault, four Israeli
fighter-bombers fired eight rockets at the installations. The
guerrillas immediately closed all roads leading to the bases.
   Thirty minutes later, a police spokesman said, another formation
of Israeli fighter-bombers hit the bases as the guerrillas tried to
evacuate their casualties.
   The raids brought to six the number of Israeli air strikes
against guerrilla targets in Lebanon this year. The last was Feb.
16 against a Shiite Moslem Amal militia base in al-Hajjah in
southern Lebanon.
   The Moscow-oriented Democratic Front and terrorist Abu Nidal's
Fatah-Revolutionary Council regularly attack targets in Israel's
self-designated ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon.
   Israel usually launches air strikes into Lebanon in retaliation
for guerrilla raids.
   The army said the Democratic Front was responsible for a series
of attacks on Israeli troops, including an incident Wednesday in
which four guerrillas tried to infiltrate into Israel's buffer zone
in southern Lebanon. One guerrilla was killed and three captured in
that incident.
   The security zone, six to 10 miles deep, was established when
Israel withdrew the bulk of its army from Lebanon in 1985, three
years after it invaded. The zone runs east from the Mediterranean
coast to the slopes of Mount Hermon and was designed as a buffer
against guerrilla raids.

   A huge East German crane began dismantling a
long section of the Berlin Wall next to the Brandenburg Gate on
Monday night and thousands of people cheered.
   More than a mile of the wall is to be taken down between the
Reichstag building and the Checkpoint Charlie crossing point. Most
of it is to be replaced by a fence.
   ``This is terrific,'' said Ralf Lukas, an East German soldier
who operated the crane. ``It had to happen. I was terribly lucky to
be on the job.''
   A crowd of onlookers, estimated by one policeman at 7,000,
cheered as the crane began removing pieces from the top of the wall
and loading them into a truck to be hauled away.
   ``I'm so happy to see the wall come down,'' said Rita Wolter,
20, of East Berlin. ``It was a blight on our country.''
   Others stood on sections of the wall away from the crane,
watching the work under bright floodlights.
   Joachim Damme of West Berlin brought his little girl. ``This is
a historic event. I want to be part of it. I also want to show this
to my daughter.''
   East German officials said they will leave a 200-yard gap in the
wall between the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag, but nearby
fences on the eastern side would prevent unobstructed access to the
opening.
   Rainer Menzel, a spokesman for East German border troops, said
the entire wall between the gate and Checkpoint Charlie would be
down by the end of March.
   Since Nov. 9, the East Germans have been opening numerous
passages through the Berlin Wall, although the East Germans require
a check of passports or identity cards at all of them.
   The Reichstag is the expected seat of the Parliament of a united
Germany, although officials say it will take years to renovate the
ornate building.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of ethnic
Albanians demonstrated in Yugoslavia's restive Kosovo province
Monday in renewed unrest that has killed at least 27 people since
Jan. 24.
   At the same time, rival Serbs called for action against ethnic
Albanian ``separatists and terrorists'' at a rally in Kosovo Polje,
a Pristina suburb, Belgrade television reported. It did not say how
many people took part.
   The 1.9 million ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population. They are at odds with the province's minority Serbs,
who allege they are being forced out of Kosovo, a historic region
for Serbians.
   The state Tanjug news agency said a police commander of Serbian
nationality was injured when a stone hit him in the head at a
demonstration by thousands of ethnic Albanians in Urosevac, about
25 miles south of the provincial capital of Pristina.
   ``Volleys of gunfire'' were heard overnight in Podujevo, a town
20 miles north of Pristina, Tanjug reported early Monday. Albanians
were firing into the air to celebrate the reported release of
prominent dissident Adem Demaqi, who has spent nearly 29 years in
prison for separatist activity, it said.
   Pristina radio said Demaqi was set free on Sunday.
   But a police statement carried by Tanjug said Demaqi was still
in prison, serving out a 15-year term to which he was sentenced in
1976.
   Demaqi, 53, a sociologist, has been imprisoned almost
continuously since 1959. His release was a major demand in huge
demonstrations that shook the region last month.
   More 20,000 people gathered on Monday to greet Demaqi in Ljupce,
near Podujevo, and thousands more were on their way, said local
reporter Sefki Ukai.
   A human rights group in the Croatian capital of Zagreb said
Demaqi was the longest-serving political prisoner in Europe.
Yugoslav prisons hold 600 other political prisoners, almost all of
them ethnic Albanians, news reports said.
   Elsewhere on Monday, about 20,000 ethnic Albanians marched
through Decani, about 45 miles west of Pristina, chanting
``Democracy, democracy!'' local reporters said.
   Schoolchildren have boycotted classes throughout Kosovo for the
past week. Thousands of them confronted police in regional towns on
Monday, but no casualties or arrests were reported.
   Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, administers the province.
Major unrest that flared a year ago over Serbia's decision to curb
Kosovo's autonomy killed 28 people, by official count.
   New violence motivated by Serb-Albanian rivalries began Jan. 24
and has killed 27 people so far this year, according to official
figures.
   The trial of 15 prominent ethnic Albanians accused of engaging
in counterrevolutionary activities was adjourned Monday after the
father of a defense attorney was shot to death in a clash Friday
between security forces and demonstrators.
   Tanjug also reported on Monday that Communists within the
military have called for a new hard-line Marxist party in Slovenia,
following a decision by that republic's liberal Communists to break
with the ruling national party.
   The Slovenian Communist Party decided Feb. 4 to split from the
national organization and change its name to the Democratic Renewal
Party following disputes between Slovenia and archrival Serbia over
the pace of democratic reform.
   The influential military leadership has in the past stayed out
of the political feud between reformers in Slovenia and Croatia,
which advocate Western-style democracy and regional autonomy, and
hard-liners in Serbia, who favor a more centralized system.
   Slovenia and Croatia plan to hold Yugoslavia's first multiparty
elections since World War II in April.

   West Germany's ambassador to the
United States told American Jewish leaders Monday they have little
to fear from German reunification, but he met sharp questioning.
   In his first public address to a Jewish audience since serious
discussions began of a union of East and West Germany, Ambassador
Jurgen Ruhfus said Germans have for four decades worked to make
sure Nazi atrocities can never be repeated.
   He said a united German state would be accountable not to
nationalism but to a new European federation based on individual
freedoms and human rights.
   ``We Germans are aware that a Germany growing together will be
viewed in part with concern, with considerable concern,'' he told
about 500 delegates at the American Jewish Congress' national
covention. ``We are convinced that this fear is unjustified.''
   Ruhfus repeated West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's rejection
of the Soviet position that the united Germany be neutral. He said
North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership would help keep
German nationalism from again becoming the force that spurred World
Wars I and II.
   His audience was in a dubious mood, and there were repeated
questions about what the new German state would do to ensure that
centuries-old ethnic and religious conflicts would not explode.
   ``There is no guarantee. But I can from my deepest convictions
say that you can trust us,'' Ruhfus said, prompting groans from the
crowd. ``You can count on Germans to stand up against any
infringement of human rights.''
   Ruhfus was asked what has changed about Germans that should
allow Jews to trust them.
   ``I understand the feelings of those who have suffered. If we
want to shape the future, we must be aware of the past,'' he said.
``The first thing that has changed is that the Germans themselves
have awakened in horror at what was done in their names. They are
standing up and saying we must never let this happen again.''
   Members of the audience were skeptical.
   ``The concerns so deeply felt by so many Jews because of the
trauma of the Holocaust are not easily susceptible to dissipation
by some simple, even rational, political formula,'' Henry Siegman,
executive director of the American Jewish Congress, said afterward.
   ``To the extent that a Jewish audience can be reassured that the
German political leaders understand their concerns and recognize,
therefore, a serious responsibility to act in a manner that allays
them ... the ambassador's presentation was extremely well received
and considered reassuring,'' Siegman added.
   Ruhfus said West Germany has accepted responsibility for the
Hitler-era deaths of some 12 million people, including 6 million
Jews. It demonstrates this, he said, by compensating victims
financially, by being a staunch ally of Israel, and by placing its
goal of a unified Germany within a European framework.
   Ruhfus hailed talks in Ottawa last week in which France,
Britain, the Soviet Union and United States endorsed German unity.
He also called for a summit to create pan-European institutions,
based in a unified Berlin, that would include a European human
rights court, an environmental protection agency, and an agency to
verify disarmament by NATO and Warsaw Pact countries.
   ``This could become the first step on the way to a European
confederation that French President (Francois) Mitterrand has
recently proposed. My government supports this idea as a concrete
goal for our joint efforts to create a Europe undivided from the
Atlantic to the Urals.''
   With the new German state ``embedded in the future architecture
of Europe, the country will have no interest in the sort of
nationalist hegemony that fueled the wars of Kaiser Wilhelm and
Adolf Hitler,'' Ruhfus said.
   Monday was the conclusion of the four-day conference.

<HEAD>Colombian Police Seize 10 Missiles in Raid; Guerrillas Blow Up
Pipeline</HEAD>

   Secret police said they seized 10
shoulder-fired missiles from drug traffickers on Monday, four days
after President Bush came to Colombia amid fears the traffickers
would use such weapons against him.
   The missiles can shoot down aircraft.
   In another development, leftist guerrillas blew up Colombia's
main oil pipeline for the sixth time this year in an effort to
force the government to nationalize U.S. and other foreign oil
holdings. Officials said the pipeline would be out of service until
at least Wednesday.
   A news release from the Administrative Security Department, the
country's secret police, said the missiles were found in a raid on
a Bogota drug hideout.
   It said two men arrested there were suspects in the November
slaying of TV news anchorman Enrique Pulido in the capital.
   Pulido was one of 13 news media workers killed since President
Virgilio Barco last August ordered security forces to wipe out the
traffickers.
   The police gave few details of the raid.
   A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration source told The
Associated Press last month that Colombian security forces have
been making spectacular raids based on information found in records
discovered in previous raids.
   Police and the army have seized scores of ranches, mansions and
warehouses belonging to traffickers, and $33 million in U.S. cash
and gold.
   The U.S. Secret Service warned before Bush visited Cartagena
last Thursday that drug traffickers had SAM-7s, a surface-to-air
missile that is capable of downing large aircraft.
   The Medellin cocaine cartel said on Jan. 17 it would dismantle
its drug empire and stop its campaign of terror in Colombia if the
government agreed to a truce. Security forces have kept pursuing
the traffickers, however.
   Bush went to the Caribbean port city of Cartagena to meet with
presidents Barco, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz Zamora of
Boliviad, and all reaffirmed their will to fight drug traffickers.
   The White House considered danger of attacks from traffickers or
leftist guerrillas so grave that it had Bush land in Barranquilla,
a half-hour away from Cartagena, because the airport there is more
isolated. Bush flew by helicopter over the ocean to Cartagena.
   Sunday's oil pipeline attack was by the National Liberation
Army, the government oil company Ecopetrol said in a news release.
   It said guerrillas blew up several yards of the pipeline near
the village of Convencion, about 250 miles north of Bogota.
   The pipeline carries oil from the big Cano Limon field in
northeastern Colombia to the Caribbean coast.
   The same guerrilla group tried to blow up an oil pipeline near
Yopal, 125 miles north of Bogota, Sunday night, but the explosion
did not break the line, Ecopetrol said.

<HEAD>Kohl Makes Peace in Cabinet on NATO Role in United Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl made peace
between his defense and foreign ministers Monday on the NATO role
in a united Germany, while Germans exiled from areas now in Poland
demanded their homelands back.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and the defense
minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, issued a statement at Kohl's request
saying neither soldiers from the alliance nor West German troops
should be stationed in what now is East Germany.
   Stoltenberg suggested on Friday that NATO defenses be applied to
a ``whole Germany.'' Genscher said the defense minister was
``causing unnecessary irritation where a subtle touch was needed.''
   In East Berlin on Monday, most participants in weekly talks
between the government and opposition spoke against NATO membership
for a united Germany and said it should be demilitarized.
   As a precondition for reunification, they said, East and West
Germany should issue a joint statement guaranteeing Poland's
borders and giving security assurances to other European countries.
   About 50,000 East Germans who favor a rapid union participated
in the weekly rally Monday at Leipzig, a center of the
pro-democracy movement.
   Hans Modrow, East Germany's Communist premier, told opposition
leaders he would not go ``on his knees'' for interim aid from West
Germany.
   At meetings with Kohl and other West German officials last week
in East Berlin, Modrow asked for 15 billion marks ($9 billion) in
``solidarity aid'' to tide his government over until the nation's
free elections on March 18.
   Bonn refused on grounds that East Germany would not disclose its
financial condition or accept an offer to make the West German mark
the currency of both countries. West Germany did provide the
equivalent of about $3.5 billion in aid for projects over which
East Germany will have little control.
   Negotiations on economic and currency union begin Tuesday in
East Berlin, although Modrow's government has made clear such a
step cannot be approved before the elections.
   Dieter Vogel, government spokesman in Bonn, told reporters Kohl
summoned Stoltenberg and Genscher to the chancellery Monday. Their
statement repeated assurances Kohl made during talks in Moscow with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who favors a united Germany
must be neutral.
   Genscher and Stoltenberg, who represent different parties in the
governing coalition, said no NATO units or facilities would be
extended into what is now East Germany.
   They said that included West German troops under NATO command
and those not directly assigned to the alliance, such as
territorial defense units.
   Last month, Genscher suggested what now is West German territory
remain part of NATO and the area east of the Elbe River, now East
Germany, be militarily neutral.
   Stoltenberg's signature on the joint statement with Genscher
effectively reversed the position the defense minister took Friday,
that NATO troops defend all of united Germany.
   ``The security policy of the area now comprising East Germany in
all its aspects is to be determined with the freely elected
government of East Germany as well as with the four powers
responsible for Germany'' since World War II, it said.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain still have
rights in Germany. The foreign ministers of all six powers
announced last week that negotiations on German unity would begin
soon after the East German elections.
   Poland has asked to be represented because of possible German
claims to land awarded to Poland after Germany was defeated in 1945.
   About one-third of modern Poland was in Hitler's Third Reich.
East Prussia became part of the Soviet Union and now is called
Kaliningrad.
   Two organizations of Germans evicted from those areas say the
lost territories should be considered in plans for German
reunification.
   ``We are not giving up our Silesia,'' the ultra-conservative
Silesian Society said in a statement Monday. An article in the
latest edition of the Association of Exiles' weekly newsletter also
raised the border issue.
   Herbert Czaja, head of the West German Association of Exiles and
a member of Parliament from Kohl's Christian Democratic Union,
declared: ``We cannot give up our homeland and 114,000 square
kilometers (45,600 square miles) of Germany.''
   About 12 million Germans were driven from Silesia and East
Prussia after the war and at least 2 million died.
   Kohl has clouded the border issue by not publicly supporting the
current border between East Germany and Poland.

Forces</HEAD>

   Union leaders will not be intimidated
by anti-abortion forces waging a letter-writing campaign aimed at
keeping them neutral on the issue, AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
said Monday.
   Kirkland spoke to reporters after the 14.1-million member
federation of unions opened its annual winter meeting.
   As expected, the Executive Council skipped voting on pro-choice
resolutions and appointed a 14-member committee to determine
whether the AFL-CIO should take a position on abortion, an issue
the organization has sidestepped for more than a decade.
   Kirkland said union presidents have received a flood of letters
from religious leaders and others urging them not to take an
abortion stand.
   The anti-abortion National Right to Life Committee has said the
AFL-CIO should not take a position on abortion because it is not
directly related to such labor issues as collective bargaining and
work place conditions.
   Pro-choice union officials disagree, saying abortion effects the
economic well-being of working women and that the AFL-CIO has taken
positions on a wide range of issues, including civil rights, gay
rights and school busing.
   ``I do not think the committee will be moved by threats or
suggestions of reprisals,'' Kirkland said of the letter-writing
campaign. ``I think the committee will address the issues fairly
and rationally and on the merits and will act accordingly.''
   Some of the letters warned that rank-and-file union members
opposed to abortion would likely seek to have part of their union
dues withheld if the AFL-CIO adopted a pro-choice position.
   Pro-choice union representatives said the committee formed to
take up the abortion matter is comprised equally of those who think
the AFL-CIO should take a stand and those who prefer sitting out
the issue to avoid alienating anti-abortion union members.
   ``I would say that the committee probably breaks down almost
50-50,'' said Joyce Miller, vice president of the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
   Miller, a pro-choice member of the abortion committee, predicted
the AFL-CIO could adopt a pro-choice position as long as it
includes language acknowledging the moral and religious views of
some union members.
   Kirkland would not reveal his personal position on abortion.
   The committee's chairman, William Wynn, president of the United
Food and Commercial Workers International Union, is pro-choice, but
has said his personal feelings would not influence the panel's
decision.
   Kirkland did not give the committee a deadline, but pro-choice
officials want a decision by the Executive Council's May meeting.
That would allow labor leaders to use abortion as an issue in
making endorsements for political candidates this year.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole was to meet Tuesday with union
officials as the AFL-CIO works toward a warmer relationship with
the Bush administration than it had with President Reagan.
   Several prominent Democrats already have met with the labor
leaders, including Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald
Brown. He said organized labor's support will be crucial to the
party's congressional redistricting efforts.
   Brown sought help for the party's $2.5 million redistricting
plan, which is already partly funded by labor.
   The party is putting special attention on 16 states that stand
to gain or lose seats because of population shifts in the 1990
census, and states where legislatures are closely divided between
Republicans and Democrats.
   ``We think it's going to come down to the battle of the Great
Lakes and the battle of the Sunbelt,'' said Tim Dixon, executive
director of the party's redistricting effort, called ``Project
500.''
   Brown listed the 16 states as: Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, New York,
Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.
   ``Thanks to the critical support of labor, the hand that draws
new district lines in 1991 will more often be Democratic ones,''
Brown said.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt also met with union
chiefs to discuss issues such as child care, the proposed Social
Security payroll tax cut and shifts in defense funding.

   Politicians have moderated their
violent language, strengthening hopes that Sunday's elections will
be peaceful, free and fair, the head of the U.N. observer mission
said.
   Iqbal Riza of Pakistan said Monday threats exchanged by the two
major political groups had worried all three three major observer
groups monitoring the vote.
   The ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front and the
U.S.-backed United National Opposition alliance of 14 parties are
the main rivals. The other two observer missions are from the
Organization of American States and former President Jimmy Carter's
Council of Freely Elected Heads of Government.
   ``Over the last two weeks we had been rather worried about
possible violence'' on election day and the day after, Riza said,
speaking to reporters in Spanish at the foreign correspondents'
club.
   ``Over the last few days, the tone has been lowered ... and we
are noticing a willingness by each party to avoid violence,'' he
said.
   More than 1.7 million Nicaraguans are expected to vote Sunday
for a president, vice president, National Assembly, councils for
144 municipalities and two regional councils for the Atlantic coast.
   Riza said the U.N. and OAS observer missions would make private
projections as early as Sunday night, based on a sample of partial
returns. The missions also are to make complete vote counts,
parallel with that of the Supreme Electoral Council.
   Both the projection and the vote count will be kept
confidential, for comparison with the official results, and will
not be made public until later ``unless there's need to,'' Riza
said.
   He would not define such a need, and said the figures would be
included in the final reports of the observer missions.
   Speculation was that the observers might decide to release the
information if there was evidence of cheating, but Riza seemed to
dismiss the possibility of vote manipulation.
   ``We are convinced there can be no massive fraud, not only
because of our presence but because of the measures taken,'' he
said.
   The U.N. and OAS missions together will have 600 observers, in
teams of two, visiting up to 80 percent of the 4,394 polling
places. At least 1,000 more observers will represent many other
observer missions.
   Officials and candidates of the opposition alliance, commonly
called UNO, claim the Sandinistas have turned government resources
to party use.
   ``UNO has told us they anticipated an unbalanced campaign, and
they have entered the race with this knowledge,'' so the alleged
unfairness cannot be used now to invalidate the elections, Riza
said.
   ``It's not that the process has been perfect,'' he said, but
irregularities have not occurred ``to the degree of disqualifying
the elections.''
   Leaders of both sides have made threats against each other in
the past two weeks. Virgilio Godoy, the opposition candidate for
vice president, said in two campaign speeches the alliance would
``make the Sandinistas pay'' after it won the election.
   President Daniel Ortega said the Sandinistas might close the
opposition newspaper La Prensa, owned by his challenger, Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro, and confiscate the homes of Mrs. Chamorro and
Godoy. The Sandinistas have closed La Prensa before.
   Interior Minister Tomas Borge made campaign appearances in which
he accused the opposition of planning disturbances to disrupt the
elections.
   Opposition leaders denied the accusations and gave personal
assurances to Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Managua, who has the respect of both sides.
   All parties met at the Supreme Electoral Council Friday. Riza
said the council will issue a general accord, to be signed by all
parties, pledging them to promote peaceful elections.
   UNO closed its campaign with a rally Monday in Managua that
attracted 60,000 supporters. The Sandinistas will close their
campaign Wednesday with a rally in the capital.
   No campaigning is allowed after Wednesday.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Giotto Awakened After Four-Year Hibernation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Space Agency said its satellite
Giotto, in hibernation since a spectacular 1986 rendezvous with
Halley's Comet, reawakened Monday on a signal from Earth and is
being readied for another mission to a comet.
   ESA began sending a series of commands to Giotto from the Madrid
tracking station of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Deep Space Network in Spain to activate the
spacecraft.
   Two hours and 21 minutes later, the response came, a weak
whisper from 62 million miles away but enough to tell technicians
at the ESA's European Space Operations Center in Darmstadt, West
Germany, that Giotto was back in business.
   The wake-up call was sent from the Madrid station's 100,000-watt
transmitter and 230-foot-diameter antenna.
   ESA's mission control team now will perform a series of complex
maneuvers to bring Giotto's high-gain antenna into a better
position to increase the signal strength and obtain telemetry data.
This was expected to take several days, after which a complete
checkout of the spacecraft will be run.
   On March 14, 1986, Giotto passed within 375 miles of Halley's
Comet. The satellite was then put into hibernation, sleepily
revolving around the sun at a rate of once every 10 months.
   In September, the ESA's Space Science Committee decided to
assign Giotto to rendezvous with the Grigg-Skjellrup Comet in July
1992. But it could take weeks for the scientists at Darmstadt to
find out if Giotto is up to the job.
   If its solar panels can still provide enough electricity to
charge Giotto's batteries, if the color camera and other
instruments still work, the craft will be given the signal July 2
to begin its new trip.
   Passing within 13,600 miles from Earth, Giotto would use
terrestrial gravity to increase its speed to catch up with
Grigg-Skjellrup, a comet that circles Earth every 5.09 years.

   Police fired Monday on demonstrators
demanding an end to Nepal's 29-year-old ban on political parties,
killing five people and wounding 12, witnesses said.
   A government minister said three people were killed and five
injured in the clash in Bhaktapur, near the capital, Katmandu.
   Kamal Thapa, minister of state for communications, said police
were trying to control ``extremists'' and had to fire ``when the
crowd tried to create an unpleasant scene. They (police) had
earlier used water hoses and charged with clubs to disperse the
demonstrators.''
   He said the situation was brought under control after two hours.
   On Sunday, a policemen and three demonstrators were killed on
the first day of a planned mass campaign by the outlawed Nepali
Congress Party and the United Left Front, an umbrella group of
Communist Party factions, to demand restoration of a multiparty
system in Nepal.
   The Congress Party had pledged a peaceful campaign, but Thapa
said the party had lost leadership of the movement and that it was
in the hands of people who not support non-violent tactics.
   ``The situation is not grave, but certainly alarming. We are
determined to suppress these extremist elements,'' he said.
   Thapa said the opposition's demands ran counter to the verdict
of a 1980 national referendum in which people voted in favor of
continuing the non-party system.
   The non-party system was introduced 29 years ago after King
Birendra took over the administration and dissolved the elected
Congress Party-led government, which he accused of misusing power.
   Katmandu was largely deserted Monday as shops closed in
accordance with the opposition's call for support. Taxis and
private buses stayed off the roads in support of the campaign, but
some state-run buses and other vehicles were seen.
   Student agitators burned a bus in nearby Kirtipur township and
broke the windshields of a couple of others.
   Thapa said 175 people had been arrested since Sunday, and
another 559 had been detained earlier. Four national assembly
members were among those arrested, he said.
   Opposition sources put the number arrested Sunday in Katmandu
alone at more than 400.
   Thousands of demonstrators turned out Sunday, shouting, ``We
want democracy!''

   The days when an Argentine family
could feast on filet mignon for less than what hamburger cost in
most other countries may be nearing an end, Agriculture Secretary
Felipe Sola indicated on Monday.
   Like most everything else in an economy wracked by
hyperinflation and recession, beef now is priced in U.S. dollars
rather than Argentina's debased currency, the austral. For many
Argentines, beef already is out of reach.
   ``We Argentines will have to get used to meat ... as something
that is almost a luxury,'' Sola told reporters after conferring
with President Carlos Menem at Government House.
   ``We will eat less or choose less expensive cuts. Of course,
that's not a happy or attractive situation for Argentines, but it's
reality.''
   For more than a century, beef has been to Argentina what oil is
to Saudi Arabia: a major export, a source of prosperity, a national
symbol.
   Herds were so plentiful that travelers on the pampas, the
fertile plains surrounding Buenos Aires, could shoot a cow for
dinner and sometimes eat just the tongue, according to legend _
provided they left the hide, which would be sold for leather.
   Cows still outnumber Argentina's 31 million citizens by almost
2-1, and a top steak in a good restaurant can be had for 10,000
australs _ $2.50 _ or about what 2.2 pounds of filet mignon costs
in a butcher shop.
   That's still cheap in international terms, but for many
Argentine salaries that have shrunk to $50 to $250 a month, it is
increasingly expensive.
   Consumption has fallen as inflation soared to 8,164 percent in
the past 12 months.
   Argentina still will consume more beef and veal this year than
any other nation _ just under 140 pounds per person, according to
projections by the U.S. Agriculture Department's foreign
agricultural service.
   But already, lifestyle changes are apparent.
   This nation that loves to dine out, does so less and less.
Guests at weekend barbecues often bring their own meat to throw on
the grill. Noodles and rice have replaced beef on the shopping
lists of Argentines suffering wage shrinkage or unemployment, which
stands at about 10 percent.
   So far, the government has refused to intervene in the meat
market, where prices rose 45 percent between Friday and Monday.
That is slightly more than the austral, which traded Monday at
4,200 per dollar, devalued last week.
   The rate a year ago was 17-1.
   The cost of living this month is projected on a par with what it
was in January, 79 percent. Workers might expect pay raises in that
neighborhood, but meat almost certainly will have climbed faster,
propelled by ranchers who would rather sell abroad than at home.
   ``The price of meat is `dollarized,' '' Sola said.

   Ground was broken Monday for a prayer
center that officials hope will end a long dispute over a Roman
Catholic convent at the Auschwitz death camp.
   Also Monday, Edgar Bronfman, president of the World Jewish
Congress, met with President Wojciech Jaruzelski and Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki and declared later: ``There are no outstanding
problems between the Jewish people and Poland.''
   In Israel, the religious affairs minister said the construction
of the new prayer center removed ``a very hurtful obstacle'' in
relations between Israel and Poland.
   ``In my view the Poles are seriously expressing a willingness to
open a new page of good relations'' with the Jews, said the
minister, Zevulun Hammer.
   The convent housing about a dozen Carmelite nuns on the edge of
the Nazi death camp has angered Jews and others worldwide, who see
it as an intrusion of Christian symbols at a site where most of the
victims were Jews.
   The Roman Catholic church agreed at negotiations in 1987 in
Switzerland to relocate the nuns to an interfaith prayer and
education center farther from the camp, but a February 1989
deadline for moving the nuns was missed.
   After Polish church officials balked last year at fulfilling the
agreement, the Vatican intervened in September and upheld the
decision. The new Solidarity-led government of Mazowiecki also has
worked to speed up construction of the new center.
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, whose archdiocese has
jurisdiction over the site near the southern Polish city of
Oswiecim, presided over the groundbreaking ceremony.
   ``May justice, peace and love radiate from this place and let
people find enough strength in this place to overcome what divides
them, for the ... good of mankind,'' Macharski said as he took a
shovel and dug out a few scoopfuls of dirt.
   During his meeting in Warsaw with Bronfman, Macharski said his
government's support of the project was illustrated by the presence
at the ceremony of Jacek Ambroziak, head of the Office of the
Council of Ministers and the prime minister's close aide.
   ``This is not only a matter for Poland or Europe,'' Ambroziak
said before the ceremony. ``The construction of this center will
have international significance in view of the extermination of the
Jewish nation, which here suffered the greatest losses.''
   The first phase of construction will be to erect a temporary
fence around the site, now an empty field with a few trees in the
distance and a sign announcing the planned construction.
   Bronfman called the groundbreaking ``very important.''
   Citing the prayer center construction, Poland's plans to launch
full diplomatic relations with Israel next week, and the
government's pledge to fight anti-Semitism, Bronfman said that
there were no longer problems between the Jews and Poland. But he
also said he did not know exactly when the interfaith center would
be completed and the nuns moved.
   ``I don't think deadlines are useful,'' he said. ``It creates a
kind of emotionalism that I think is not good, so I did not press
for an absolute deadline. The spirit was, as soon as possible.''
   He also expressed concern at what he called ``a resurgence of
anti-Semitism in Poland.''
   This ``is part I suppose of the price of democracy,'' Bronfman
said. ``If you are free to do anything else, you are free also to
not like people.''
   But he said the government's stance against anti-Semitism is
``very clear.''
   ``I express the intention of the Polish government in all
matters relating to Polish-Jewish relations to arrange them
successfully and to remove all frictions,'' said Mazowiecki, in a
brief statement after the meeting.
   ``We are thoroughly opposed to any form of anti-Semitism and we
believe that ... it should be counteracted by every means.''
   The new religious center at Auschwitz will be about a
quarter-mile from the death camp on a nine-acre site.
   Known officially as the Center for Information, Dialogue,
Educaton and Prayer at Auschwitz, it will include meeting rooms,
exhibition and conference halls, a library and accommodations for
nearly 100 people, PAP said.
   A separate section of the building will house the convent,
according to the Rev. Marek Glownia, appointed to head the
foundation by the Krakow Archdiocese.
   The Vatican has pledged financial support for the construction,
and funds also will be raised by the foundations and churches
elsewhere in Europe.

were killed, police said Monday.
   The Kobela and Wela tribes raided each others' villages Sunday
after the groups quarreled over the grazing rights, police said.
The fighting erupted in Natal Province on the east coast.
   All of the dead were men, police said. About 12 huts were set on
fire in the fighting, they said.

<HEAD>Angola, Cuba Meet About Suspended Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angola and Cuba began talks Monday in
Luanda on Cuba's decision to suspend withdrawal of its troops after
four Cubans were killed in a rebel raid, the Angolan news agency
ANGOP reported.
   Officials from both countries demand guarantees from the United
States and South Africa that rebels of the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola will be restrained from attacking the
departing Cubans.
   The rebels are said to receive $50 million a year in U.S. aid
and previously were supported by South Africa.
   Four Cubans were killed and seven wounded in a rebel raid Jan.
21 in western Angola, north of the 13th parallel, and Cuba
suspended the withdrawal Jan. 25. That line is the southern limit
for Cubans under regional peace accords signed by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa.
   A meeting of a three-nation joint commission with U.S. and
Soviet observers, originally scheduled for mid-February, has been
postponed to an unspecified date in March by request of the United
States and South Africa, said military sources in Luanda, the
capital of Angola.
   Under the peace agreements Cuba promised to withdraw its
estimated 50,000 soldiers by mid-1991. In return, South Africa
pledged independence for Namibia and to stop aiding the UNITA
rebels, led by Jonas Savimbi.
   Angola became independent of Portugal in 1975 but the civil war
did not stop.
   UNITA was not a party to the peace agreement, but promised not
to attack the Cubans as they withdrew. More than 31,000 Cubans had
been repatriated by Jan. 25.

<HEAD>Strikes Shut Down Argentine Banks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Bank and five other
national banks were hit by strikes Monday over plans to close
surplus branches and lay off staff.
   ``We're not against restructuring state and private banks, but
we want to be at the negotiating table,'' said Hector Pizzichini, a
leader of the 149,000-member Bank Workers Association, after
thousands of members marched noisily through Buenos Aires'
financial district.
   In other unrest over government economic policies, university
professors began an indefinite strike demanding that their salaries
be nearly doubled to $90 a month. Their action may stall the start
of the college year, set for next month.
   Also, clerks who shut down federal courts last Thursday to back
up their wage demands plan to do so again this Thursday and Friday.
   The government last week proposed closing 14 branches of the
National Mortgage Bank, which was reported to run at a huge deficit
and said to be overstaffed. About 1,200 jobs would be lost,
although the government pledged to transfer those who did not
retire.
   Government officials said then that similar measures would be
taken at the National Savings Bank and the National Investment Bank.
   The National Investment Bank went so far astray in granting and
collecting on loans that its 60 biggest debtors alone owe it $1.9
billion, the newspaper Pagina 12 reported Sunday, citing data it
said was obtained from the bank.
   Striking employees virtually closed down all three banks on
Monday.
   Besides the Central Bank, the Bank of the Nation and the Buenos
Aires Province Bank _ the two biggest in the country _ also were
disrupted.
   Labor Minister Jorge Triaca accused striking bank employees of
``meddling in plans that the government has established,'' and said
the strike may be declared illegal if employees don't return to
work ``immediately.''
   That would allow the government to fire workers and take other
discipinary actions.
   Tensions between the government of President Carlos Menem and
organized labor have been growing since he adopted policies seen as
anti-union, although labor backed Menem in the national elections
last May.
   To curtail inflation of 197 percent last July, the month he took
office, Menem allowed prices to rise faster than wages, and
increased public service rates by as much as 600 percent.
   Critics say Menem has put a higher priority on narrowing the
fiscal deficit and reducing inflation than on safeguarding workers'
buying power.
   Saul Ubaldini, one of the two secretaries-general of the 3
million-member General Labor Confederation, last week urged Menem
to ``change the political economy,'' and pressed for big increases
in the national minimum wage.
   Member unions have resisted Menem plans to privatize
deficit-ridden state companies.
   The confrontation coincides with a new burst of inflation. The
cost of living soared by 79 percent in January and is projected at
about the same rate this month.
   The austral, Argentina's national currency, lost another 11
percent against the dollar, trading at 4,500-1 on Monday compared
to 4,000-1 on Friday. The austral lost 36 percent of its value in a
week and 73 percent since early January.

<HEAD>Troops Detain Half of Ruling Military Council In Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MASERU, Lesotho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops detained three members of the
ruling six-man military council Monday in an apparent internal
political dispute in this southern African kingdom, witnesses and
diplomats said.
   Following the incident, the head of the military council, Maj.
Gen. Justin Lekhanya, said on government radio that ``some
changes'' would be announced shortly. He did not elaborate.
   Information Minister Vincent Malebo held a brief news conference
Monday afternoon but refused to confirm or deny that members of the
military council had been arrested.
   Troops surrounded government headquarters and forced three army
colonels on the military council, with their hands raised above
their heads, to get into the back of a military truck, the
witnesses said.
   The transportation minister, Col. Monyane Mokhanpso, also was
taken into custody, according to witnesses, who said all four were
taken to a military base.
   There were no reports of violence and the troops withdrew after
the men were detained, diplomats said. Civil servants fled from the
complex when the troops were deployed, they added.
   At the palace of King Moshoeshoe II, soldiers prevented workers
and visitors from entering or leaving the building, witnesses said.
   Lekhanya and his military council rule Lesotho in consultation
with King Moshoeshoe II. The council, which has good relations with
the South African government, seized power in a bloodless 1986 coup
that ousted the increasingly leftist government of Leabua Jonathon.
   According to the witnesses, the three members of the military
council who were detained are Sekhobe Letsie, Thaabe Letsie and
Aloysius Mosoeunyane, all of whom are colonels. The Letsies, who
are brothers, also are cousins of King Moshoeshoe II.
   The military council has banned all political parties and
refused demands to call elections in Lesotho, which is completely
surrounded by South Africa.
   There have been reports of turmoil within the government since
disclosures that Lekhanya fatally shot a college student in
December 1988. At an inquest last year, Lekhanya said he shot the
student, George Ramone, after the man attempted to rape a woman and
then fled. The inquest ruled the shooting a justifiable homicide.
   Lesotho is a tiny, mountainous country of about 1.6 million
people. Roughly one half of the adult male labor force works as
migrant laborers in South African mines.

   As Otto von Bismarck once said, ``Politics is
the art of the possible'' _ as possible as wrongly attributing the
quote to a legendary Irish barkeeper.
   For pundits and politicians wanting to punch up their
pronouncements with such pithy remarks, help is at hand. For $29,
the Library of Congress will provide 2,100 similarly sage sayings,
and with the right attribution.
   Over the years the library's Congressional Research Service has
found itself continually bombarded by requests for appropriate
quotes for use in papers and speeches.
   Its researchers have discovered that many a quote popularly
attributed to a famous person was actually uttered or scribbled by
someone else: for example, the German chancellor's comment on
politics often attributed to Finley Peter Dunne's Mr. Dooley.
   The 520-page volume entitled ``Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary
of Quotations Requested from the Congressional Research Service''
and for sale by the Government Printing Office has several similar
examples.
   Lincoln's ``You can fool all of the people some of the time and
some of the people all of the time ...'' has never been verified,
the volume points out. Nor has ``Let them eat cake,'' alleged to
have been said by Marie Antoinette when informed the French people
had no bread.
   ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,'' generally
attributed to former Green Bay Packer coach Vince Lombardi, was
actually said by Red Sanders at Vanderbilt in 1948, the volume
reports. In fact, it adds, Lombardi always denied having said it.
   Other corrections in attribution include ``It is better that one
hundred guilty persons escape than one innocent person should
suffer,'' often attributed to Supreme Court justices Oliver Wendell
Holmes or Louis Brandeis, actually was first stated by Benjamin
Franklin.
   Currently the most requested quotation, the Research Service
says, is from a 1977 speech of former Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey:
   ``It was once said that the moral test of government is how that
government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children;
those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who
are in the shadows of life -- the sick, the needy and the
handicapped.''
   A member of Congress contemplating action _ or inaction _ might
consider British author G.K. Chesteron or French statesman Georges
Clemenceau.
   ``I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act;
but I do believe in a fate that falls on them unless they act,''
Chesterton wrote.
   ``In order to act, you must be somewhat insane. A reasonably
sensible man is satisfied with thinking,'' Clemenceau once said.
   The collection is replete with patriotic quotations, always
popular with politicians, including large sections under such
headings as America, Democracy, Citizenship, Patriotism and Union.
   But quotations are also included under such headings as Vietnam
and Watergate, Tyranny and Violence, Hate and Ignorance.
   Even a few last words are included, such as Sir James M.
Barrie's ``To die will be an awfully big adventure,'' and ``Don't
give up the ship,'' attributed to Admiral Oliver Hazard Perry.
   Indeed, that attribution to Perry is a strength of the volume,
which takes three paragraphs to note that the same quote has also
been attributed to many other historical figures.
   It is intriguing to speculate, the compilers comment in their
introduction, what circumstances could have led members of Congress
to request such quotes as:
   _``If you give me six lines written in the hand of the most
honest of men, I will find something in them which will hang him.''
Cardinal Richelieu of France.
   _``Never explain; your friends do not need it and your enemies
will not believe you anyway.'' American writer and editor Elbert
Hubbard.
   _``Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build a
bridge even where there is no river.'' Nikita Khrushchev.
   _``He has been called a mediocre man; but this is unwarranted
flattery. He was a politician of monumental littleness.'' Theodore
Roosevelt discussing President John Tyler.
   _``It is a sin to believe evil of others, but it is seldom a
mistake.'' American writer and critic H.L. Mencken.
   _``I didn't say that I didn't say it. I said that I didn't say
that I said it. I want to make that very clear.'' Former Michigan
Gov. George Romney.

   Maoist guerrillas raided an Andean hamlet
as the villagers slept, killing nine peasants and wounding seven,
police said Monday.
   Two rebels were reported killed in the fighting Sunday between
Shining Path guerrillas and members of the village militia of Manco
Capac in Ayacucho department, 235 miles southeast of Lima and 18
miles east of Ayacucho.
   In other weekend Andes violence, Shining Path rebels killed
three policemen and two government agronomists in an attack
Saturday on Pariacoto village in the Callejon de Huaylas region,
195 miles north of the capital.
   They burned the police station, municipal headquarters and court
house.
   A Shining Path column attacked Manco Capac before dawn, firing
automatic weapons and yelling, ``Black heads, surrender!'' The
villagers fought back with homemade shotguns, slings and lances,
survivors told police.
   The rebels use the term ``black heads'' scornfully to refer to
peasants who have formed civil defense groups under pressure from
the army, whose troops use black ski masks.
   Members of the village's ``peasant patrol,'' as the civil
defense units are called, later captured five rebels and turned
them over to military authorities, police said.
   More than 17,500 people have been killed in political violence
since the Shining Path began its insurgency in May 1980.

   Interim President Ion Iliescu said
Monday the army and police should have more power to curb protests
because violent anti-government demonstrations could lead to
anarchy and a new dictatorship.
   More than 300 people staged a rally Monday evening, but this one
was well away from government headquarters _ Sunday's target _
after 12 armored personnel carriers and hundreds of soldiers
blocked access.
   One soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
unlike Sunday, when the army was ``caught unprepared by the angry
demonstrators,'' soldiers now had ``very specific orders to let no
one near the building.''
   About 5,000 miners rallied on Monday in support of the
government, angrily demanding an end to protests that culimnated
Sunday when about 500 people ransacked government headquarters,
smashing windows and doors with rocks and iron carpet rods.
   Some miners attacked bystanders with sticks. At least four
onlookers were injured, including a gray-haired man rescued from
the miners by soldiers.
   Iliescu said the 21-member Executive Bureau of the ruling
Provisional Council of National Unity decided to propose a law
``increasing the power of those organizations that must maintain
law and order and defend institutions and citizens against violent
acts.''
   He warned that violence unleashed by political passions could
throw the country into the kind of anarchy that has torn Lebanon
asunder.
   ``If the army and police don't have the legal ability to
maintain order, people will feel it necessary to defend themselves
_ we could become like Lebanon, and anarchy could lead us to total
chaos,'' he said in an address read on state television.
   ``We appeal for civic responsibility. Anarchy can only lead to a
new dictatorship.''
   Iliescu, who did not outline the proposed powers sought for the
army and police, spoke amid reports of pro-leadership
demonstrations nationwide.
   Gen. Dumitru Penciuc, the nation's police commissioner, was
quoted by state radio as saying pro-government rallies were held in
Cluj, Brasov, Turda, Bistrita, Jiului Valley and in Bucharest.
   The broadcast gave no details.
   But state TV showed Iliescu meeting with miners and saying the
anti-government demonstrators were ``hooligans'' hired by ``foreign
agents'' _ rhetoric strikingly similar to that used by toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu to describe his opposition.
   Hundreds of protesters stormed government headquarters in
Victory Square on Sunday in the most violent protest since
Ceausescu's ouster and execution in December.
   They occupied the building for about three hours, briefly
holding Vice Prime Minister Gelu Voican Voiculescu before hundreds
of troops arrived to establish order.
   The protesters shouted ``Down with communism!'' and ``Down with
Iliescu!'' alleging that the interim president was linked to the
discredited Communist Party and that the Securitate, Ceausescu's
secret police, continued to operate.
   While Iliescu was a former ranking Communist official _ he was a
Central Committee secretary in charge of propaganda _ he lost his
position of power in 1971 after falling afoul of Ceausescu.
   Police on Sunday detained 80 of the demonstrators who occupied
the government building, according to Executive Council spokesman
Dan Radulescu. He earlier had said 120 people were taken into
custody and did not account for the discrepancy.
   But sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said an
additional 20 people had been detained since Sunday on suspicion of
leading the demonstration.
   Iliescu said there would be an investigation to identify the
leaders of Sunday's protest. He described them as ``circles
interested in destabilizing the situation in our country and
restoring the vestiges of the dictatorial regime'' of Ceausescu.
   But Radulescu later appeared to weaken suspicions of a
conspiracy behind the assault.
   Police ``took down statements as to who sent them and why they
were there,'' he said of the protesters, but ``they were mostly
drunk, and they were released and probably will not be investigated
any further.''
   Radulescu said three or four soldiers were injured, ``crushed by
the mob,'' but denied rumors of deaths.
   The news agency Rompres had said at least 20 troops were
severely injured. Radulescu did not comment on the discrepancy, but
some Rompres reports have proved exaggerated in chaotic,
post-revolutionary Romania.
   Earlier Monday, workers removed debris from Sunday's protest and
set new glass panes into the dozens of ornate windows and doorways
of the government building. Others wiped slogans off the building
proclaiming the ``National Salvation Front equals the Romanian
Communist Party.''
   The Front, whose collective leadership included Iliescu and
several other former Communists who opposed Ceausescu, controlled
Romania for six weeks after the December uprising before
reluctantly yielding to opposition pressure to share power, pending
May elections. It now governs along with 37 other parties or
political movements in the Provisional Council of National Unity.
   Other, non-Front members of the leadership joined Iliescu in
condemning Sunday's violence.
   Ion Minzatu, president of the Romanian Republican Party, called
the incident ``an unfortunate action on the part of unknown
manipulators ... which will find retribution in court.''
   Several demonstrators said government agents had instigated
Sunday's protest to discredit protesters and justify harsh
countermeasures.

   Authorities moved to placate separatist
Moslem militants Monday by dissolving the legislative assembly of
Jammu-Kashmir state and acknowledging that the 1987 polls in which
it was elected might have been rigged.
   Also Monday, at least three people were killed and six injured
in confrontations between security forces and Moslem protesters
agitating for the secession of the Kashmir valley from
Hindu-majority India.
   State Gov. Jagmohan said the Jammu-Kashmir assembly was being
dissolved because it had ``lost its representative character.''
   The move clears the way for new elections to the assembly, which
could form the basis for making peace overtures to the militants.
Many of the militants say they were members of political parties
earlier, and began agitating for an independent nation after what
they claim was widespread rigging during the 1987 elections.
   ``It has been alleged that in 1987 some vested interests had
rigged the election,'' Jagmohan said in a statement issued in
Srinagar.
   In those elections, Farooq Abdullah was voted the chief
minister, the top elected post in the state administration, for a
five-year term. Abdullah resigned from the post on Jan. 19 to
protest the appointment of Jagmohan as governor of the state.
   Jagmohan, a Hindu who uses one name, has said that quelling
militant violence and holding new elections is the only way to
defuse the separatist movement in the Moslem-majority state.
   Police reported at least three deaths Monday as Moslem crowds
violated curfew orders in two towns in the valley.
   Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two
people were killed and six injured when police opened fire to
control a rioting mob in the town of Bijbehara, 30 miles southeast
of Srinagar.
   One person was killed in the town of Shopian, 33 miles south of
Srinagar, in another incident of police firing, they said.
   The deaths raise to at least 103 the number of people killed
since authorities launched a crackdown on the Moslem movement on
Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been protesters killed in police
firing on curfew violators.
   The movement for secession of Kashmir from India is at least
four decades old, but has flared in recent months. The state of
Jammu-Kashmir, which includes the valley and the plains of Jammu to
the south, is India's only Moslem-majority state.
   India and Pakistan have both claimed Kashmir since the Indian
subcontinent was divided along religious lines after gaining
independence from Britain in 1947.
   The countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, and Pakistan
occupies a slice of the valley. A U.N.-monitored cease-fire line
divides the valley into Indian and Pakistani sectors.
   India accuses Pakistan of fomenting the trouble in Kashmir.
Islamabad denies the charge but says the Kashmri people have a
right to self-determination.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are Moslem.
Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of the 880 million
population. Hindus make up 82 percent.

<HEAD>98 Percent of Cancer Risk in Diet from Ordinary Foods, Scientist
Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Natural carcinogens in meat, grain and other
foods are a far greater danger than pesticides and additives,
accounting for more than 98 percent of the cancer risk in the diet,
a government scientist said Monday.
   Even a minor reduction in these naturally occurring hazards, he
said, would surpass the benefits of eliminating all traces of
dangerous manmade chemicals.
   The culprits include not only such recognized health hazards as
fats and beer but such seemingly innocent products as bread,
yogurt, mushrooms and many spices, including cinnamon and nutmeg.
   ``The risk is from natural carcinogens in the diet, because they
overwhelm all the others,'' said Dr. Robert J. Scheuplein, director
of the Office of Toxicological Sciences at the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
   This does not mean that all food is dangerous or even that
people can do much about the hazard. Instead, Scheuplein's analysis
was intended to focus attention away from what he sees as a largely
bogus health issue _ the hazards of chemical contamination.
   He contended that the public is worried about the wrong risks in
their diet, in part because of exaggerated news accounts of such
scares as Alar in apples, cyanide in grapes and dioxin in milk.
   Scheuplein based his conclusions on a statistical analysis of
the quantity of cancer-causing agents in the diet.
   He said that the risk of dying from cancer from dietary exposure
to both natural and manmade carcinogens, or cancer-inducing
substances, was 7.7 percent. The risk from naturally occurring
carcinogens alone was 7.6 percent.
   ``Most of the risks are people's personal choices,'' Scheuplein
said. ``They are not imposed on people by corporations. Apparently
that's a hard lesson. People want to blame somebody.''
   Scheuplein presented his findings at a meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Dr. Frank Young, a former FDA commissioner who is now deputy
assistant secretary of Health and Human Services, said he agreed
with Scheuplein's contention.
   ``The headline should not be, `All Foods Cause Cancer' or `Drop
Dead. Don't Eat,''' Young said. ``The good news is, let us not as a
nation focus just on the technological food additives. We ought to
focus on the big issues as well.''
   Scheuplein said the clearest cancer-causing agent in ordinary
food is fat, which has been linked with several kinds of tumors.
However, he said most foods now eaten would not pass safety tests
required for new food chemicals and additives.
   He estimated that carcinogens make up one-tenth of 1 percent of
the food people eat. Among concerns he cited were:
   _Well-cooked, high-protein foods, such as meat and eggs, contain
bacterial substances that can cause genetic mutations. An ordinary
day's protein can be as damaging to the genes as five cigarettes.
   _Hazardous urethane is a natural product of fermentation. It is
present in beer, yogurt, bread and other foods.
   _Mycotoxins produced by molds are common in many foods,
especially when stored in warm, humid conditions. Aflatoxins occur
in corn and peanuts, zearalenone in soybeans and luteoskyrin in
yellow rice.
   _Smoked or salted fish and pickled vegetables may cause
digestive cancers. This is attributed to nitrates and funguses.
   _Grilling and charring fish or meat can produce potentially
hazardous substances, such as nitropyrenes.
   _Many spices contain questionable substances. There is estragole
in tarragon, eugenal in cloves, cinnamaldehyde in cinnamon,
myristicin in nutmeg and anethole in fennel. Several spices,
including oregano, marjoram and bay leaves, may cause genetic
damage.
   _Other naturally occurring carcinogens include d-limonene in
oranges, psoralens in celery, hydrazines in mushrooms and nitrates
in spinach.
   ``Even a modestly effective attempt to lessen the dietary risk
of natural carcinogens would probably be enormously more useful to
human health than regulatory efforts devoted to eliminating traces
of pesticide residues or other specific trace-level chemicals,''
Scheuplein said.

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Asks Vigilance Against Ethnic Strife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng, apparently concerned about
ethnic separatism in the neighboring Soviet Union, ordered that any
such movements in China be wiped out immediately, an official
report said Monday.
   ``A tiny number of separatists, under the mantle of nationalism
and religion, oppose socialism and sabotage the unity of all
Chinese nationalities,'' Xinhua News Agency quoted Li as telling
officials in charge of minority affairs.
   ``We must not relax our vigilance. We should wipe out all
separatist activities while they are still in the embryonic stage.''
   Li spoke last Thursday, Xinhua said. The release of speeches is
often delayed in China.
   China has 55 ethnic minority groups who make up a total of 8
percent of the country's 1.1 billion population. But the regions
they inhabit comprise more than 60 percent of China's territory,
including vast, undeveloped steppes and mountain regions on the
country's borders.
   Historically, fierce battles were waged among the various
groups. The Mongols and the Manchus at times defeated the majority
Han and ruled the Chinese Empire.
   Since the Communists took power in 1949, minority uprisings and
protests have occurred but have been swiftly put down, sometimes
with bloodshed.
   Chinese officials have refused to comment publicly on Soviet
ethnic unrest, but recently have stepped up calls for unity and
vigilance against unrest.
   Officials in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, a huge arid
region in China's far northwest, said last month they would step up
anti-riot training for police and intensify intelligence work among
the mostly Moslem residents.
   The premier, ignoring past ethnic clashes, said China's
minorities ``share the tradition of loving their motherland and
safeguarding national unity. This is the superior quality and
spiritual wealth of China.''
   Li did not mention the most strife-wracked minority region,
Tibet, where four clashes with Chinese security forces resulted in
dozens of deaths since October 1987. Tibet's capital, Lhasa,
remains under martial law imposed after a clash last March.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Murder Trial Linked to Mail Bombs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection began amid imposing security
measures Monday in the trial of Emmanuel Hammond, who is accused of
a murder that may have enraged a mail-bomb assassin.
   Julie Love, 27, was found shot to death in northwest Atlanta
last August, more than a year after her disappearance prompted a
nationally publicized search.
   The case was prominently mentioned in a letter from ``Americans
for a Competent Federal Judicial System,'' claiming responsibility
for the December mail-bomb assassinations of a federal judge in
Alabama and a Savannah alderman and civil rights attorney.
   The letter said the group had ``assassinated judge Robert S.
Vance and attorney Robert Robinson in reprisal for atrocities
inflicted upon Julie Love.'' The letter also threatened more
violence in response to crimes by black men against white women.
Ms. Love was white; Hammond, 24, is black.
   Armed sheriff's deputies were posted in and around the
ninth-floor courtroom Monday at Fulton County Superior Court, with
an extra metal detector outside the room. Bomb-sniffing dogs are
checking the courtroom daily, court officials said.
   Fifty potential jurors were summoned to court. After Judge Ralph
Hicks told them the jury would be sequestered for up to three weeks
during the trial, 25 told him they would be under great hardships _
mostly family or business concerns _ and were excused.
   Attorneys for Hammond and the prosecution then began questioning
the remaining potential jurors individually, chiefly about their
feelings on the death penalty and their knowledge and opinions of
the highly publicized case. More potential jurors will be called
and jury selection may take several days, Hicks said.
   The prosecution is seeking the death penalty for Hammond, a
Marietta resident charged with murder, felony murder, kidnapping
and armed robbery.
   Many potential jurors said they were familiar with the case.
Those saying they could remain impartial were retained for further
consideration.
   Both sides asked potential jurors if race might be a factor in
their deliberations.
   Hammond's cousin, William Porter, pleaded guilty in November to
felony murder, rape, kidnapping and armed robbery in the case. He
has not been sentenced and is expected to testify against Hammond,
who police contend fired the fatal shot.
   The trial originally was to have started Jan. 30, but was
postponed because mental competency hearings were not completed in
time. Earlier this month, Hammond was ruled competent to stand
trial.
   Ms. Love's disappearance in July 1988 sparked a huge search that
included billboards and posters all over the Atlanta area with the
message: ``Have You Seen Julie Love?'' Many of the prospective
jurors questioned Monday recalled the search efforts.

   Nearly two dozen people have been arrested for
allegedly violating Japan's election laws in the parliamentary
balloting, and police expect to arrest hundreds more, an official
said Monday.
   The National Police Agency official said 19 of the 23 people
arrested by Monday evening were suspected of vote-buying, two of
forging votes and two of violating regulations regarding published
materials. The parliamentary election was Sunday.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said police expected the
number of arrests nationwide to reach 430, and he said most cases
probably would involve attempts by campaign workers to buy votes.
   He said 295 places, including 19 campaign headquarters, had been
searched bted election law violations.
   In the most publicized case so far, police late Sunday arrested
one of candidate Kunio Takaisecause of suspechi's private secretaries for
allegedly
handing out cash to voters in an apparent attempt to buy votes.
   Takaishi, a former vice minister of education, is currently
facing charges of bribery in the widespread Recruit
influence-peddling scandal. He was not elected.
   The maximum penalty for vote buying is three years in prison or
a fine of $1,390.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow fell over the Southwest on Monday, with up to 17
inches in northern Arizona, and more rain fell on the flooded
Southeast.
   Bitterly cold air settled over Nevada and the northern Rockies.
   A low-pressure system centered over northeastern Arizona on
Sunday produced heavy snow in Arizona and Utah. One to 2 feet of
snow fell in the mountains of southern Utah overnight and 3 to 8
inches of snow fell in the valleys.
   Snowfall totals in northern Arizona included 17 inches at the
south rim of the Grand Canyon and 15 inches at Flagstaff and
Williams. Flagstaff is at an elevation of nearly 7,000 feet and the
canyon rim is several hundred feet higher.
   The storm also produced heavy snow in Nevada, with 12 inches
reported at Kyle Canyon on Mount Charleston. During the weekend, up
to 6 feet of snow fell in the Sierra Nevada along the
Nevada-California border and Reno, Nev., got 21 inches.
   The storm also spread heavy snow into New Mexico and Colorado,
and snow was expected to spread into parts of Texas, Oklahoma and
Kansas during the night and Tuesday.
   Winter storm watches were in effect into Tuesday for the Texas
Panhandle, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwestern Kansas.
   Strong northerly wind ushered cold air into the Great Lakes
area, producing snow squalls in some areas.
   After several days of heavy rain that caused severe flooding
across the Southeast, showers were scattered along the Gulf Coast
and the southern Atlantic Coast on Monday. During the six hours up
to 1 p.m. EST, 0.49 of an inch of rain fell at Valdosta, Ga.
   But during the 24-hour period up to 7 a.m. EST, 3.17 inches fell
at New Orleans, 2.98 fell at Athens, Ga., and 2.72 fell at
Montgomery, Ala.
   Showers and thunderstorms produced 2.51 inches of rain at New
Orleans in six hours Sunday evening and 2.15 inches at Athens, Ga.
Fairhope, Ala., got 3.75 inches of rain overnight.
   Parts of Alaska had bitter cold early Monday. Bethel reported a
record low of 30 degrees below zero, with wind chill readings as
cold as 70 below zero. Northerly wind up to 30 mph in the Saint
Paul area produced wind chill readings as cold as 30 degrees below
zero and reduced visibility to less than a quarter of a mile in
blowing snow.
   Temperatures dipped into the single digits or below zero
overnight in the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah, from the
northern Rockies to the upper Mississippi Valley, and in northern
New England.
   Reno, Nev., chilled to a record low of 7 below zero, 14 degrees
below its previous record for the date. Medford, Ore., tied its
record of 20.
   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 25 below zero at West
Yellowstone, Mont.

   A thin layer of gasoline coated a remote
section of the Intracoastal Waterway on Monday after two barges
collided head-on in a rainstorm, igniting a fire that burned for
about five hours, authorities said.
   One minor injury was reported and three families were briefly
evacuated after gasoline spilled from one of the barges in the
accident Sunday.
   The sheen of gasoline left in the water posed a risk of
explosion, but was expected to evaporate by nightfall, said Coast
Guard Chief Petty Officer Michael Robling.
   One of the barges was loaded with 30,000 gallons of gasoline and
the other was carrying coke, a form of coal.
   Robling said the gasoline barge retained all but about 10
percent of its cargo. The rest burned in the fire or spilled.
   The Coast Guard plans to unload the two barges before trying to
separate them and clear them from the channel, Robling said. He
said equipment to unload and move the barges wasn't expected to be
in place until late Monday or early Tuesday.
   The collision happened during a rainstorm, but the cause was
under investigation.

<HEAD>Gerasimov Says Soviets Proceeding by `Trial and Error'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By OLIVER TEVES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov
said Monday his countrymen are learning their new freedoms by
``trial and error'' and Soviet journalists are rewriting Soviet
history.
   Gerasimov, a speaker at a conference of Asian journalists, said
the ``administrative command system'' of the past had to be changed
because it did not suit modern Soviet society.
   The old system created a large group of ``educated people'' who
asked ``troublesome questions ... the kind of questions asked and
discussed in the privacy of their homes, usually in the kitchen,''
said Gerasimov, head of the Foreign Ministry information department.
   He said the Soviet press then began ``rewriting our own history
so energetically that one deputy in our parliament complained that
there is nothing more unpredictable than our history.''
   Journalists exposed corruption and bad management everywhere in
the bureaucracy with such vigor that ``everyone wondered if there
are honest people left,'' he said.
   ``All this gave our people the sense of urgency for change and
the feeling of power to bring this about,'' Gerasimov said,
describing that as ``good news.''
   Gerasimov added, however, that some people ``misused''
democratic freedoms because they lacked experience with freedom of
expression.
   ``In the bad old days of so-called stagnation, we followed Oscar
Wilde's maxim: A problem does not exist if it is not talked
about,'' he said, citing unrest in several Soviet republics.
   Rumors have helped create tension in the troubled regions, he
said, and told the journalists: ``We used to have no real freedom
of the press and no conflicts to report. Now we have more than our
share of conflicts and we learn the hardest way, which is by trial
and error.''
   He expressed concern about ``negative reporting'' that starts
``the mechanism of self-fulfilling prophecies.''
   Soviet journalists have been ``too shy or too diplomatic to
write the whole truth'' about developments in Eastern Europe,
Gerasimov said, and described their reporting as ``insufficient ...
reflecting the legacy of easygoing reporting in the past.''
   About political upheaval in the former Soviet satellites, he
said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika reform program
``was a signal for a change in their own society, but the leaders
didn't listen. The people did.''

   Former Deputy Finance Minister Nikos
Athanassopoulos was jailed Monday because an investigating
magistrate and prosecutors feared he might flee the country to
avoid trial in a financial scandal.
   Athanassopoulos , a Socialist member of former Premier Andreas
Papandreou's Cabinet, faces possible prison sentences of 10 years
to life if convicted of ordering a coverup of an illegal sale of
corn to the European Economic Community.
   He was charged with instigating a fraud that harmed the
interests of Greece and the EEC and of complicity in the forgery of
certificates of origin for the corn. No trial date was set.
   Twelve civil servants face similar charges in the 1986 sale of
9,000 tons of Yugoslav corn to an EEC member in 1986. The corn was
passed off as Greek to avoid trade levies imposed on non-EEC
agricultural products and to draw subsidies, authorities say.
   Athanassopoulos denies any wrongdoing, saying the coverup was
the result of a decision taken with other government ministers to
protect Greece's interests.
   On Monday he claimed his detention was political and not a
judicial decision.
   ``It will boomerang on a certain political camp,'' he said,
referring to the conservatives.

   President F.W. de Klerk will
go to Zaire this week to meet President Mobutu Sese Seko and other
African leaders, his office announced Monday.
   De Klerk has made several trips to black African states in
recent months, but the trip Saturday will mark his first group
meeting with African leaders.
   The statement did not say who else would be at the meeting or
what matters would be discussed.
   However, likely topics would include the civil war in Angola,
Zaire's southern neighbor, and the political reforms de Klerk has
initiated in South Africa.
   Days after de Klerk leader assumed power, he visited Mobutu last
August. Since then, de Klerk also has traveled to Zamiba, Ivory
Coast and Mozambique.
   De Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, made several trips to black
African states in his final year in office as part of South
Africa's effort to ease its isolation on the continent.
   Malawi is the only African nation that has full diplomatic
relations with South Africa. Most of the others say South Africa
must end its apartheid policies of racial segregation before they
will consider relations.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Ashley plays Isadora Duncan in `When She Danced'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``When She Danced'' has a heroine who in real
life was wildly romantic, shamelessly manipulative, overly
melodramatic and fatally extravagant. So why is she so difficult to
capture on stage?
   That's one of the themes author Martin Sherman explores in the
play, a intriguing slice-of-life look at Isadora Duncan, the quirky
high priestess and great revolutionary of modern dance.
   Sherman's play, which opened Monday at off-Broadway's
Playwrights Horizons, suggests that only those who saw her dance
could begin to understand the woman.
   The comedy-drama skillfully blends fact and fiction. It takes
place in Isadora's Paris apartment in 1923, four years before her
odd death, when she strangled on a long scarf which caught in a
rear wheel of her open-air automobile.
   Despite the title, the playwright doesn't let Isadora dance on
stage. How can you recreate what made her great? Instead, he
suggests what the woman must have been like through her own
outrageous actions and through the memories of a parade of admirers.
   Sherman's Isadora, floundering in her mid 40s, is down but not
out, particularly in Elizabeth Ashley's heroic performance, a
portrait that revels in all of Isadora's excesses.
   At the start of the play, the dancer has been married to the
psychotic Russian poet, Sergei Esenin, for a year and hopes to
return to Russia where she runs a dance school.
   To survive in Paris, she sells off furniture from the apartment
and awaits a visa to Vienna so she can get back to work. She also
has plans to persuade the Italian government to finance a dance
school in Italy.
   The playwright surrounds Isadora with a menagerie of misfits,
all of them speaking a different language. They come together in a
disastrous, hilarious second-act dinner party where the lack of
communication is the least of the problems.
   Besides Sergei, Isadora's supper companions include Miss Belzer,
a mousy Russian translator hired to communicate with Sergei;
Alexandros, a young Greek pianist who worships Isadora; Mary, a
rich American friend in charge of what is left of Isadora's waning
career; Luciano, an Italian government official, and Christine, an
ungainly Swedish girl who is an awkward discipline of Duncan's
distinctive dance technique.
   The play is just as much about these people's remembrances of
Isadora as about the lady herself. Sherman is particularly adept at
evoking the joy Isadora's dances brought to people. Throughout the
evening, he stops the action so her admirers can soliloquize about
her unique talent.
   Especially affecting is Marcia Jean Kurtz as the comic but
forlorn Miss Belzer, a refugee from the Russian Revolution. In her
performance, Kurtz distills the worship Isadora evoked.
   Marcia Lewis gets every laugh she can from the role of Mary,
Isadora's confidante, but Jonathan Walker is not always convincing
as Isadora's maniacal younger husband.
   Tim Luscombe, a young British director who made his Broadway
debut earlier in the season with Tom Stoppard's ``Artist Descending
a Staircase,'' handles the shift in action from tragedy to
melodrama to farce with ease.
   The autumnal setting, a decaying apartment designed by Steven
Rubin and filled with fading golds, browns and grays suggests the
disintegration of Isadora's career.
   ``I can not explain,'' says the Greek pianist portrayed with
touching enthusiasm by Robert Sean Leonard as he tries to describe
what made Isadora's dancing so extraordinary. Neither can Sherman,
but he has built a fascinating play that nevertheless celebrates
her elusive art.

<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright who
went from prison to the presidency of Czechoslovakia inside of
eight months, will meet with President Bush on Tuesday, the first
of Eastern Europe's new democratic leaders to visit the White House.
   Havel arrived here Monday evening after stops in Iceland and
Canada on a Western trip that comes conspicuously a week before his
first trip to Moscow.
   The Czech Parliament elected Havel president Dec. 29, a few
weeks after a peaceful revolution led to the ouster of Communist
Party chief Milos Jakes and his hard-line government.
   Now the country, under Havel's caretaker government, is
preparing for June 8 parliamentary elections that will be its first
free balloting in more than 40 years.
   Havel has said he is coming West not to look for charity but
investment in a country that already maintains a standard of living
well above that of Poland, its neighbor to the north.
   ``Czechoslovakia is not looking for U.S. aid. They are not in
the same economic dire straits that ... Poland has been in,'' a
senior Bush administration official said.
   Shirley Temple Black, the U.S. ambassador to Czechoslovakia,
agreed.
   ``What they want is mainly language help,'' Mrs. Black told
reporters after she accompanied Havel on the helicopter trip from
Andrews Air Force Base to Washington. ``They want to know about
managing _ in other words how to do it. They didn't come for the
money.''
   After arriving, Havel spent about 15 minutes in a ``very
cordial'' meeting at Blair House with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, said Havel's press secretary, Michael Zantovsky.
   In a visit to Canada before coming to Washington, the Czech
Prime Minister, Marian Calfa, signed agreements with Quebec Premier
Robert Bourassa for cooperation in hydroelectricity, pulp and paper
and other areas.
   In a whirlwind seven-hour visit to the Czech and Slovak
communities of Toronto on Monday, Havel received an honorary degree
from York University bestowed on him in absentia in 1982, when he
had little chance to leave the country.
   Baker, in a brief visit to Prague Feb. 6, already signaled
support for giving Czechoslovakia most-favored-nation trade status
and allowing it to rejoin the International Monetary Fund. It was a
founding member of the IMF, but was evicted after the 1948
communist takeover.
   And, if Congress approves, Czechoslovakia would share in a pool
of $300 million in new aid the Bush administration has requested
for the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The United States has already announced plans to reopen its
consulate shuttered for more than four decades in Bratislava in the
Slovak region of Czechoslovakia.
   The administration also expects to expand exchanges and possibly
dispatch Peace Corps volunteers to Czechoslovakia, said the
official who briefed White House reporters on the Havel visit.
   The new Czech government is prodding the Soviets to remove their
73,500 troops as quickly as possible. Sharing borders with both
East and West Germany, Czechoslovakia also has no small stake in
the thrust toward German reunification.
   The Czechs ``favor a Europe that is democratic and in which
Germany plays a role, but not necessarily a dominant role,'' said
the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The new government has also said it plans to quit selling arms
to countries engaged in hostilities, and eventually stop exporting
arms altogether. The Czechs have been a supplier for Cuba and
Nicaragua.
   Havel favors ``a gradual abolition of the Warsaw Pact,'' and
some members of his government have said NATO should dissolve, too.
Bush will try to convince Havel that NATO still has a role to play
in keeping Europe stable and peaceful.
   Havel, 53, spent five years in Czech prisons and his plays were
banned for nearly two decades for his defense of human rights and
liberty.
   He succeeded Gustav Husak, who became president a year after
backing the Soviet invasion of August 1968. Husak relinquished
power without a fight in the face of massive protests in Wenceslas
Square by students and the Civic Forum opposition group.
   Bush, after a private chat with Havel in the Oval Office and
together with top ministers in the Cabinet Room, will hold a
private luncheon for Havel.
   On Wednesday, Havel will address a joint session of Congress,
then travel to New York for a round of business, political and
cultural contacts that includes a rock concert in his honor. He
leaves for home Thursday night.
   While Havel is the first of Eastern Europe's new officeholders
to visit the White House, Bush gave the Presidential Medal of
Freedom _ one of America's highest honors _ to Lech Walesa of
Poland's Solidarity movement last Nov. 10.

<TEXT>
   Independent Mayor Xavier Suarez said Monday he
appreciates a ``Suarez for Governor'' T-shirt, but has no plans to
challenge Gov. Bob Martinez this year.
   The third-term mayor met last month with Republican foes of
Martinez who encouraged Suarez to challenge the GOP governor.
   ``I have consulted my family and myself and have concluded that
this is not an opportune time for me to be campaigning for
statewide office,'' Suarez said.
   ``I also take seriously the mandate of my constituents, who
placed their trust in my leadership as mayor during the next four
years,'' he said.
   Suarez was elected in November to a new four-year term. He said
he was impressed by attention from members of Martinez' own party,
attention that may have laid a foundation for him to seek a
statewide office in the future.
   ``It was nice to know that a lot of people knew who I was and
had a favorable opinion,'' Suarez said.
   Martinez, a first-term governor elected in 1986, called Suarez's
decision ``good news.''
   ``We're of course delighted he will continue to be mayor of the
city of Miami,'' the governor said. ``It's always good for someone
to stay in the office they hold.''
   Suarez, father of four, said the timing of a statewide race
wasn't right for his family.
   He said his nonexistent gubernatorial campaign was bolstered by
letters from supporters and even a ``Suarez For Governor'' T-shirt.
   Suarez worked on President Bush's campaign in 1988 and worked
for Martinez in 1986, but has supported several Democratic
candidates in other races.
   Republican state Sen. Marlene Woodson-Howard has announced plans
to challenge Martinez in the Republican primary in September. On
the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson, state Sen. George
Stuart and former federal Judge Alcee Hastings plan to run for
governor in their party's primary.
   Tommy Thomas, former chairman of the state Republican Party, led
the GOP contingent that courted Suarez. He has said Martinez is so
unpopular with voters that he may lead the party to defeat and that
Suarez would be a better candidate.

<TEXT>
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano flowed into an
isolated island subdivision over the weekend, destroying one home
and threatening four others, a fire official said Monday.
   Lava overran a vacant home Saturday and encircled another home
Sunday, prompting the evacuation of two residents by helicopter,
said Jack Minassian, fire management officer at Hawaii Volcanoes
National Park.
   The homes are in the Royal Gardens subdivision on Hawaii Island.
The subdivision has been devastated since Kilauea's latest and
longest eruption.
   Since the eruption began on Jan. 3, 1983, Kilauea has claimed 75
homes in Royal Gardens and neighboring subdivisions. Only four
homes remain in Royal Gardens. The home destroyed Saturday has been
vacant since its resident left the subdivision in 1983.
   Another finger of lava east of Royal Gardens crossed the
Kalapana Bypass Highway but headed for the ocean over old flows and
did not threaten homes, Minassian said.
   Information was difficult to come by because previous flows have
cut the road into Royal Gardens. Access is limited to foot traffic
or motorcycles.
   Kilauea has caused more than $20 million in damage since the
eruption began. It has engulfed 2{ miles of roads, two miles of
water lines and two miles of utility lines.

   President Guillermo Endara and his
22-year-old girlfriend are engaged, a presidential spokeswoman said
Monday.
   Endara, 52, and Ana Mae Diaz became engaged in ``a simple
ceremony in the presidential palace on Feb. 14,'' Raquel Gomez said.
   The engagement was not announced and officials confirmed it only
after rumors began to circulate.
   Endara's wife, Marcela Cambra, died last June, a short time
after he won the May 7 presidential elections. Former dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega had the elections annulled and Endara took
office at the start of the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion that overthrew
Noriega.
   Officials declined to disclose a wedding date. A close associate
said ``it was planned for the first week in March but they decided
to postpone it until after June, when Endara's wife will have been
dead for a year.''
   Endara's parish priest, the Rev. Xavier Villanueva, has said
that Endara and Miss Diaz met at Christ the King Church, where both
had been attending Mass for two years. Miss Diaz takes up the
collection at the 11 a.m. Mass each Sunday.
   Endara has one child, Marcela Endara de Yap, 26, who has been
serving as first lady for her father, and a grandson who will be a
year old in April.

<TEXT>
   A 22-mile trail of green slime washed
ashore Monday on this barrier island off Long Island, but was
identified as harmless dead algae, officials said.
   Police initially thought the goo might have sickened a harbor
seal found stranded Sunday, but the animal was later diagnosed with
pneumonia and emphysema, ailments not related to the algae.
   Marine police, aware of the sick seal, initially thought the
algae that washed up on this 30-mile long island was an oil slick
that also might have caused a crab kill.
   The goo was mixed with thousands of crab shells, but the shells
were shed naturally by crabs that molt this time of year, said Lt.
Kent Mack, commander of the Fire Island Coast Guard station.
   State conservation officers and Suffolk County health officials
analyzed the substance and determined it contained algae, not
petroleum or sewage.
   Mack said warm weather caused the algae to multiply, then cold
weather Sunday killed it.
   Fire Island, about 25 miles east of New York City, is a summer
resort popular with the wealthy and contains a national seashore.

<HEAD>Pared Crew Continues Oil Spill Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 200 people roamed a
stretch of closed beach Monday to clean up the remainder of an oil
tanker spill that fouled Southern California beaches for two weeks.
   ``We are just chasing what's left. We're definitely on the down
swing here,'' said Jim Marino of British Petroleum, which chartered
the tanker American Trader and is directing the cleanup.
   ``Crews will remain through the end of the week,'' he said.
   About 12 miles of beach remained closed because of the Feb. 7
spill, which occurred when the 811-foot ship apparently rode over
its anchor during offshore mooring procedures.
   The tanker unleashed 400,000 gallons of crude oil, closing
marinas, threatening a wildlife refuge and fouling about 15 miles
of beach with a coating of thick goo.
   Two miles of Newport Beach and the 10,000-boat Newport Harbor
were reopened Sunday, said Newport Beach police Lt. Tim Newman.
   There was little activity in the water.
   ``The local surfers are going somewhere else. They are staying
off the beaches during this,'' Newman said.
   He expressed dismay that there were no cleanup crews on the
beach in Newport despite oil coating rocky outcroppings there.
   Marino said government agencies must first approve the cleanup
methods used.
   Proposed cleanup methods were expected to be demonstrated for
the Coast Guard and state Department of Fish and Game on Tuesday,
he said.
   ``They're talking about using sea water heated to 85 degrees,
which is warm enough to liquefy the petroleum on the rocks but
wouldn't cook any creatures,'' said Newport fire Capt. Ray
Pendleton.
   The American Trader was en route to San Francisco for permanent
repairs on its punctured hull. The patched-up tanker lifted anchor
in Long Beach on Sunday for the two-day journey.
   The spill killed 315 birds and coated another 494 birds in oil,
according to British Petroleum and state Fish and Game estimates.

   The Trump vs. Trump marital fight can only be
made worse by all the headlines it has generated, Cardinal John
O'Connor said after meeting with one of the two warring parties.
   ``Publicity makes everything more difficult than it would be
otherwise,'' O'Connor said Sunday.
   ``I think every problem that any of us have, once it's
publicized, it's almost by definition magnified. And the more
visible one is, the more intense any problem is,'' said the Roman
Catholic cardinal.
   On Friday, the cardinal met with Ivana Trump, but he would not
say what was discussed during their 45-minute meeting.
   But asked what advice he would give to somebody whose marriage
was threatened, O'Connor said: ``Pray.''
   Multimillionaire Donald Trump, who was reported last week to
have split with his wife of nearly 13 years, had sought counseling
from the minister of Marble Collegiate Church, Arthur Caliandro,
The Associated Press reported last week.
   Mrs. Trump, who turned 41 on Monday, flew Friday to the couple's
117-room mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., where Trump joined her
Sunday. Trump, 43, returned to New York on Monday after a
``wonderful trip,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein.
   The visit ``had an atmosphere full of love,'' Rubenstein quoted
Trump as saying. ``The children, Ivana and the family were very
cordial and he had a wonderful time.''
   Neither Trump nor his wife has filed any legal action to break
up their marriage.
   Trump was quoted in Monday's New York Post as saying: ``I still
love Ivana.''

   Owners of 60 oil tankers that regularly
sail the Florida Straits agreed to keep at least six miles away
from fragile reefs in the Florida Keys, Gov. Bob Martinez said
Monday.
   Fifteen of the nation's largest petroleum companies agreed
voluntarily to observe the buffer zone to safeguard against
groundings and oil spills, Martinez told reporters.
   ``The coral reefs will be a much safer place,'' he said.
   Martinez was joined by Ed Roland, chairman of the Marine
Transportation Committee of the American Petroleum Institute.
   Roland, president of Amoco Transport Co., called the agreement
``a major step in further safeguarding the southern Florida
environment.''
   Ships sailing from the Atlantic Ocean into the Gulf of Mexico
sometimes hug the reefs, often sailing along coral banks to avoid
fuel-eating currents of the Gulf Stream.
   The agreement, effective April 1, calls for ships to stay 10
nautical miles _ 12 miles on land _ from the shoreline and five
nautical miles _ six land miles _ from the edge of shallow reefs.
   The move to put more distance between ships sailing between
Florida and Cuba started last fall when three cargo ships ran
aground on the 200-mile string of barrier reefs that stretch from
south of Miami past Key West to the Dry Tortugas.
   There were no spills in the three incidents.
   In addition to the 60 tankers, 250 ships owned by the 15
companies will keep their distance during infrequent trips through
the straits.
   Roland said he couldn't estimate the cost of the program, but
said it will require extra time and fuel.
   More than 5,000 passages are made through the straits a year,
some by ships carrying as much as 21 million gallons of oil at a
time.

   Scandal and an unpopular sales tax cost the
long-governing Liberal Democratic Party voter support but it held
on to its majority in Parliament's lower house and with it the
right to name the prime minister.
   The conservative party that has been in power for 34 years lost
20 seats in Sunday's balloting but still captured a solid majority
of 275 in the 512-seat house, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 59, told reporters he was ``very
thankful for the result. Each candidate worked as if he were
crawling on the ground, and I think people gave us credit for
that.'' The party needed 271 to retain the chairmanships of all
lower house committees.
   The largest opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party led by
Takako Doi, made dramatic gains, rising from 83 seats in the last
house to 136. Had her party been able to form a governing
coalition, she could have become the country's first woman prime
minister.

   A hush-hush countdown ticked away
today for the Thursday launch of space shuttle Atlantis with a spy
satellite that reportedly will help monitor Soviet compliance with
arms-control agreements.
   A Soviet official on an unprecedented tour of the Kennedy Space
Center on Sunday said with a smile the shuttle's classified payload
was a waste of money as his country has ``no special secrets.''
   After announcing that the launch clock had started Sunday night,
NASA pulled a curtain of secrecy over the countdown because of the
shuttle's secret satellite.
   The count will be made public just nine minutes before the
planned liftoff on Thursday. Officials have said only that the
launch will take place between midnight and 4 a.m., but sources
close to the program report Atlantis and its crew of five military
officers are to take off at 1 a.m.

   The widespread adoption of existing
energy-saving technology could cut U.S. energy use by 75 percent,
solving the global-warming problem profitably, a researcher says.
   Improvements in energy-efficient devices have come along so
quickly that they ``now create astonishing potential savings,''
said Amory Lovins, director of research at the Rocky Mountain
Institute in Snowmass, Colo.
   He said his studies show the proper use of energy efficiency can
outpace the current growth in the world's population, which stands
at 5.3 billion.
   A world of 8 billion people with a standard of living equal to
that of West Germany and an economy five times the current size
could survive on one-third the energy that is being consumed
worldwide now, Lovins said.

   When it comes to bedroom habits, Americans
are a rather staid lot, a new survey concludes.
   On average, adults say they have sex once a week. If they are
married, it's almost invariably with their spouse. And they
overwhelmingly eschew homosexuality.
   ``This shows that the sexual behavior of Americans is more
circumspect and traditional than the libertine impression we get
from the popular media and fiction,'' said Tom W. Smith of the
University of Chicago, who directed the survey.
   A separate study shows that teen-age boys, as well, are not
living up to their reputations. It found that adolescents seem to
be having sex less often, with fewer girls and at a later age than
teen-agers did a decade ago.
   ``This contrasts sharply with the view that most young men are
sexually promiscuous,'' said Fredya L. Sonenstein of the Urban
Institute in Washington, who analyzed the results.

   When the Census Bureau sets out to count
Americans in a few weeks, workers will have all new maps _ the
result of a massive cartographic cooperation by government agencies.
   The project was undertaken because it's not enough for the
census to just count everyone every 10 years. It also has to report
where they are.
   Since 1983 the U.S. Geological Survey and the Census Bureau have
worked together to compile a new set of computerized maps, known as
TIGER for Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and
Referencing.
   Census-takers for years were plagued by old and inaccurate maps,
sometimes setting forth with nothing more detailed than highway
department road maps.

<HEAD>Bush and Media: `Overexposure to the Thing'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   In the taunting chatter of the dugout, they'd
call it rabbit ears _ ballpark slang for the way some players seem
to hear every boo and jeer, no matter how long and loud the cheers
of the fans. This condition now appears to be afflicting a retired
Ivy League first baseman.
   But then, George Bush has company, among presidents as well as
ballplayers. They'd like the applause to be unanimous. And they
keep going to bat anyhow.
   So hours after Bush said on the way to the Cartagena drug summit
that he was going to change his ways and stop holding so many press
conferences, he held numbers 38 and 39.
   The presidential pique apparently stemmed from critical accounts
of his comments at No. 37, on Monday, Feb. 12, which turned out the
next day to have been misleading at best.
   On Wednesday, he said he hadn't known that what he said wouldn't
survive a day's events. On Thursday, irked, the president said he
was going to change his ways and stop holding so many
question-and-answer sessions because he wasn't going to get burned
any more.
   Bush has been holding presidential press conferences at a rate
never approached in the era of televised questions and answers.
There's been nothing like it since the early years of Lyndon B.
Johnson's presidency, and many of his sessions were off camera.
   Bush was supposed to have trouble with communications _ at least
by comparison with the smooth old professional, Ronald Reagan _ and
he has spent a year proving otherwise.
   And it's working. Thirteen months into his term, Bush has poll
approval ratings far beyond those of his predecessors, Reagan
included. His job performance is gaining the approval of 75 to 80
percent in the major public opinion surveys. All those news
conferences have helped build that standing.
   But that constant exposure can be wearing, even grating,
especially when it leads to adverse commentary about the answers,
some of which have indeed been misleading.
   Hence the rebuke, which wasn't unusual, although such flareups
usually come when a president is having political trouble. Bush's
political stock is up. So there is not likely to be a major shift
in the way he does business, communication included. It's working
too well for that.
   Among the specific items on which Bush comments have turned out
to be misleading:
   _The president said Feb. 12 that he didn't think it was time for
a conference of the four allied powers of World War II on German
reunification, ``not at this juncture.'' The next day, the United
States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France agreed on such a
conference.
   _Long after the administration has started planning for what
became the Malta summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Bush
said no such plans were in the works. He then said there would be
no set agenda for Malta, and went there with 21 proposals to be
discussed.
   _Shortly after the administration banned high-level exchange
visits with China because of the military crackdown on democracy
demonstrators, two Bush aides were sent on a secret mission to
Beijing. They went again in December. Bush took shelter in
semantics, saying he hadn't banned contacts, only exchanges.
   Episodes like those have led to complaints that Bush and his
aides sometimes mislead the press and therefore the public in order
to maintain secrecy on things they aren't ready to announce. There
are other ways to handle the problem. As Secretary of State James
A. Baker III said after acknowledging a televised misstatement on
China, he could and should have said no comment.
   Bush did a lot of no commenting as he lectured reporters aboard
Air Force One on the way to Colombia. ``I hate to be secretive, to
say nothing of deceptive,'' he said, choosing the words his critics
had used.
   ``I think we have too many press conferences,'' he said. ``It's
not good. It's overexposure to the thing...
   ``So from now on, it's going to be a little different.''
   Later that day, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the president had only been kidding.
   ``I think the president had it backwards,'' said Chief of Staff
John Sununu. ``I'm supposed to be the bad cop.''

<HEAD>From Pilgrims to California Cuisine, Food Comes Full Circle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pilgrims ate what they could grow because
they had to. Centuries later, the restaurant that is the mecca of
California cuisine demands what the Pilgrims were stuck with:
locally grown ingredients.
   ``A Moveable Feast,'' to be broadcast Wednesday as part of
public television's Smithsonian World series, traces the circle of
taste and necessity that shaped our eating habits.
   ``It's sort of an explanation of how the things that happened
happened. It's not really about food. It's about transportation,
growing seasons, social habits,'' Lloyd Dobyns, the program's
writer and narrator, said in a telephone interview from his North
Carolina home.
   Viewers get a fascinating tour around the United States and
through history, from the Pilgrims' introduction to indigenous
American foods to the eating revolution wrought by the railroads.
   Dobyns tells how the people who run the Air Force Academy's
cafeteria feed each cadet for $3.80 a day, and why the patrons of
New York City's 21 Club pay nearly three times that for a
hamburger. Alice Waters and one of the farmers who provide for her
restaurant, Chez Panisse, show off the glorious produce that fills
her California kitchen.
   ``A Moveable Feast,'' produced and directed by Rolfe Tessem, is
the first offering from Linda Ellerbee's Lucky Duck Productions
company. She and Dobyns co-anchored ``NBC News Overnight.''
   The show starts off a little slow, with a re-enactment of a
17th-century feast at Plimoth Plantation in Massachusetts. But it
makes the point that each wave of immigrants to this country
brought a food culture it learned to blend into what was available.
   ``What you ate was dictated by where you ate and what you could
grow,'' Dobyns explains in the program. So the Pilgrims learned
about corn, roast American eagle (which ``Miles Standish'' compares
to mutton) and at least 200 types of fish and seafood.
   Little changed for 200 years, until trains carried food to
stores thousands of miles from the farms. And with that
development, ``A Moveable Feast'' becomes a delightful journey,
too, with wonderful film clips and characters.
   In 1880, the first year of the refrigerator car, 7 million tons
of food was shipped, says Jack White, senior transportation
historian at the Smithsonian Institution. ``This radically changed
the American diet.''
   ``The railroad helped to carry us from an agricultural to an
industrial society,'' Dobyns says. ``The railroads did one thing
more. As they were born, so was the fast food chain.''
   Harvey Houses, founded by Fred Harvey, offered clean tables,
reliable food and uniformed waitresses along the railroad lines,
immortalized by Judy Garland in the 1945 MGM musical ``The Harvey
Girls.''
   ``It was the railroad that created a national menu, not food,
not taste. It's one of those things that you say, `Gee, I knew
that.' But no, you didn't,'' Dobyns said in the interview.
   The American love of gadgets was requited many times over in the
kitchen _ machines to pour pancake batter, toasters that toast more
slices of bread. Plenty of inventions were supposed to make women
happier in their kitchens, and there's a newsreel of the ``kitchen
of tomorrow _ a push-button dream coming true for Mrs. Housewife.''
   But another invention _ the automobile _ was taking people out
of their homes. Dick McDonald tells how his carhop restaurant in
California was transformed into the first burger joint under the
golden arches.
   ``We thought this was really going to be a sensation,'' he says.
   ``A Moveable Feast'' moves to the present, to another kitchen
where the burger is famous and the work fast _ a meal a minute at
lunch _ but the results very different, at the tony 21 Club in
Manhattan. Here is food as power and status, Orson Welles at the
bar, a wine cellar with bottles marked as belonging to the likes of
Elizabeth Taylor.
   Then on to food as sustenance, the U.S. Air Force Academy
kitchens. A ton of produce a day, astonishing vats of hot cereal
and chili, an enormous grill of scrambled eggs.
   For all those developments, food just didn't taste as good as it
should to Alice Waters, who opened Chez Panisse in Berkeley,
Calif., in 1971.
   ``We wanted to cook the way we had eaten in France, yet we
didn't have the foodstuffs to cook with,'' she says.
   What could be had, however, was the bounty of California farms,
and at Chez Panisse the farmer has become as important as the chef
in determining what is served. The salad greens are picked that
day, the tomatoes used depend on what is flown up from the Chino
family farm in Southern California.
   ``I think it's very important to connect people with the source
of their food,'' Waters says. And as a result, Chez Panisse winds
up nearly where the Pilgrims started _ with fresh, seasonal, local
food.

   Mind you, I'm no purist when it comes to
pesticide. I grew up on a Mississippi cotton farm in a cloud of
DDT, making war on the boll weevil. No DDT, no cotton, we figured.
   Then there was the time a couple of years ago that my elderly
next-door neighbor defoliated his entire garden by following my
advice on how to get rid of white flies without resorting to
heavy-duty poisons.
   But let me back up.
   My neighbor, Pete, you see, is an Italian-American who grew up
on Manhattan's Lower East Side and was a metalworker until he
retired to the suburbs and became the star gardener of the Baxter
Park neighborhood. Even had his picture in the local paper with
some of his yard-long beans, for which he saves the seeds from year
to year.
   Then about five years ago, I moved in, a former member of the
Yalobusha County Future Farmers of America, who cultivated 4-H Club
acre-sized cotton and corn patches with a mule-drawn shovel-stock
plow. A son of Southern soil, I was now reduced to back-yard
vegetable gardening in New England, with a shorter growing season
and limited space.
   The first time I saw Pete was around St. Patrick's Day, when I
went outside and started digging my raised beds, a new copy of
Square Foot Gardening in hand. I dug eight plots, each 6 feet by 6
feet, bordered with 4-inch by 4-inch treated timbers. In each I
dumped about 2 cubic feet of peat moss, a 40-pound bag of
store-bought composted and dehydrated cow manure and half a coffee
can of 5-10-5 commercial fertilizer.
   ``Seems like you're going to an awful lot of trouble and
expense,'' said Pete, whose own garden plot butted up against mine.
   But a few mornings later I discovered that Pete's entire garden
was covered with a 6-inch layer of cow manure _ the real stuff,
from his son-in-law's upstate farm.
   The battle was joined.
   I started setting out broccoli plants, one per square foot as
the book says.
   ``You're planting those too close together, Pete advised.
   ``What does a New Yorker know about farming,'' I thought.
   Around Mother's Day I started transplanting my tomato plants,
Supersteaks that I had started from seed on my glassed-in back
porch. I planted them about 18 inches apart, with a 6-foot trellis
to grow on.
   ``You're planting those too close together,'' Pete advised.
   Now fast-forward to mid-July.
   Pete was right about the broccoli. Crowded each other out.
   He was wrong about the tomatoes. He had nothing to compare with
my Supersteaks, some weighing around 3 pounds, plentiful and tasty.
   Then came the white fly caper.
   One Saturday afternoon I saw Pete getting ready to go after the
pests with malathion.
   ``Pete, you know you can get rid white flies with a mild mixture
of water and liquid soap, like Ivory, and it's a lot cheaper,'' I
advised.
   The ``cheaper'' got his attention.
   Now I don't know how much soap Pete used, or what kind, but the
next morning his garden was wilted. In a few days leaves were
turning brown and falling off. To his credit, he didn't yell at me.
   Summer before last came the invasion of the Japanese beetles, in
swarms not seen here in years, mating and munching away. When they
started devouring my okra (a Southern delicacy rarely found fresh
in Yankee grocery stores), it was time to bring out the heavy
artillery. Sevin. It worked.
   Last summer, I'm happy to report, I used neither soap nor Sevin.
   Every year is different in back-yard gardening. Last year, for
example, Pete had ripe tomatoes two weeks earlier than I did, and
more plentiful. But my zucchini, for the first time, was more
productive.
   One more thing about Pete and me. He never could understand why
I want to grow okra. I feel the same way about his figs. Figs, like
okra, just aren't cut out for Connecticut climate. That's why every
fall Pete goes to great pains to wrap his puny little fig trees in
plastic, tying them snugly, to fend off the freeze.
   ``Seems like you're going to an awful lot of trouble,'' I always
advise him.

   Radar is being used to spy on insects _ measuring their numbers,
when they fly, how high, and how long they stay in the air.
   A team of U. S. Department of Agriculture scientists is using
radar, which can spot an airplane or a thunderstorm 40 miles away,
to improve pest control strategies by helping predict mass insect
migration.
   Among their findings:
   _ Mild wind convergences can concentrate insects into lines
several miles wide and many miles long.
   _ Night flying insects often fly in layers if temperatures and
wind conditions are favorable. As many as five layers of insects
have been detected at one time.
   _ In a Georgia radar sample, most insects were found to fly
uniformly rather than swarm. Densities were greatest a few hours
after sunset.
   Scientists have long known that insects move vast distances in
masses but only recently have they had technology _ including radar
_ to confirm it. They hope information from their studies can be
applied to pest control strategies that will help save chemicals,
equipment, labor, and consequently money.
   ``There's a big ocean up there, transporting insects,'' says
Wayne W. Wolf, an agricultural engineer on the USDA's Agricultural
Research Service team based at Tifton, Ga.
   ``The radar right now is not capable of discriminating between
specific insects, but it can give estimates of total numbers in the
air,'' Wolf adds.
   Others on the team include entomologist Sammy D. Pair and
meteorologist John Westbrook.
   Basic radar equipment is trailer-mounted and beamed at various
altitudes to detect insects. The equipment can scan as low as 10
feet or for more than mile, depending on ground cover, terrain and
insect size. A corn earworm moth can be tracked for about 1\ miles.
   The scientists say that insects tracked by radar are too big to
be supported by air currents alone, so they must actively fly to
stay aloft. Even so, insects go to higher altitudes, where wind
currents help carry them. The researchers are trying to find out if
insects modify their behavior in response to changes in air
pressure, temperature and winds. They want to be able to predict
mass movements in air currents.
   The corn earworm, a species of moth that invades corn and cotton
fields, is one of the insects studied by the ARS. It reports that
the radar has shown that the insects ``travel mostly by night,
taking off from farms in south Texas and northeast Mexico, riding
warm winds north to targets hundreds of miles away ... flying a few
thousand feet above the ground. They come each year, billions of
them ... invading corn and cotton fields throughout the Texas high
plains, Oklahoma, Louisiana and the Missisippi Delta.''
   During one two-week period, researchers say, an estimated 6.5
billion corn earworm moths left the lower Rio Grande Valley for
points north.
   According to Alton N. Sparks of the ARS team near Weslaco,
Texas, ``Documenting the migratory behavior of insects could lead
to more efficient control programs and an early warning system that
alerts farmers to when and where infestations are most likely to
occur.''
   He believes that farmers might be cutting more deeply into
profits than necessary with blanket-approach spraying to pest
control, done when the infestation already is under way. With
better information, they can attack a pest like the corn earworm
when its population level is at its lowest, before it increases and
starts spreading over a wider area.
   Timely use of control measures at this point _ something that
would require cooperation between the United States and Mexico _
would be the best way to control the pests, according to the teams.
   The scientists use a narrow-beam radar that can spot a single,
1-inch moth flying over a mile away. ``We're perfecting our
equipment so that one day we'll be able to electronically sort and
count all the different kinds of insects in flight,'' says Wolf.
   Depending on the numbers, size and brightness, radar blips can
represent just a few insects or several thousand. During periods of
heavy migration, the engineers have tracked as many as 50,000
insects per hour and 16 million in a mile. Most of the moths take
off at dusk and then, before sunup, drop out of the air currents,
landing on corn or cotton fields to feed and breed.
   Another radar aboard a plane measures how long the moths fly and
how much moth density decreases downwind from the source fields.
When radar readings indicate a high density of insects, a plane
fitted with large nets collects samples to determine how many of
the insects being tracked are actually the worn earworm moths.
   Weather balloons also profile the atmospheric environment
surrounding the moths _ temperature, humidity, air pressure,
windspeed and direction.
   The teams say that these insects cruise in layers 500 to 5,000
feet above ground. With a favorable wind, the moths might travel as
far as 200 miles in five to 10 hours.
   ARS also is studying the fall army worm. These moths fly north
each spring from southern Florida to lay eggs in grain and forage
crops in other states and Canada.
   Non-pest insects, like honeybees, also are being tracked, to
learn more about their mating behavior.
   ``Drones or male bees are hard to track while mating,'' says Dr.
Gerlad M. Loper, ARS plant physiologist at Tucson, Ariz. ``Until
now, the only way we could pinpoint the concentration of drones was
to tie a honey bee queen to a balloon or kite and start walking.
When we got near a drone concentration, the males would suddenly
appear near the queen. This method of tracking is very inefficient
and unpredictable. Our radar detected several of these
hard-to-find, column-shaped swarms up to a half-mile away.''

   Would you like a giraffe in your garden, or a unicorn, perhaps?
Or a grouping of neat geometric figures _ an orb, a triangle, a
spiral?
   Or how about setting your guests adrift in a maze? Or giving
your herb garden a bit of pizazz by making it into a knot?
   The gardener with patience, work and imagination can do all
these things.
   But before undertaking such a project, you may want to find out
what others have created in these special gardens.
   Many botanical gardens and others open to the public around the
country have knot gardens, a formal style of arrangement of herbs
popular in Elizabethan times. One at Brooklyn Botanic Garden in New
York, for example, is an exact replica of a garden described by a
16th century writer, Thomas Hill, (under the pen name Dydymus
Mountaine) in his book, ``Gardener's Labyrinth.''
   Topiary is the art of pruning and training plants into
sculptured shapes. A master of that art was the late Harvey S.
Ladew, who became intrigued by topiary during visits to England.
His gardens in Monkton, Md., were developed between 1929 and 1971
and include a hunting scene, a Chinese junk, Winston Chrchill's hat
and V-for-victory sign, a unicorn and sea lions.
   Back in the 1870s, Massachusetts industrialist Thomas E. Brayton
purchased an estate on the shores of Narragansett Bay in
Portsmouth, R.I., because he wanted a topiary garden. His garden,
Green Animals, has more than 60 topiary pieces, including a camel,
giraffe and elephant started 70 years ago, and a horse and rider
dating back more than 40 years.
   Both the Ladew and Green Animals gardens are open to the public,
and other examples of topiary can be found in other public gardens.
   Topiary reached the height of its popularity in Europe in the
17th century, a period when mazes also were in vogue.
   But the concept of the maze, or labyrinth, is far older than
that. According to Greek mythology, Daedalus built a labyrinth on
Crete for King Minos in which to house the Minotaur. And Egyptian
King Amenemhat III built himself a funeral temple in the form of a
labyrinth.
   But these were not garden mazes. The garden variety _ made from
growing plants _ is traced back to the still-flourishing specimen
at Hampton Court Palace outside London. It was laid out around
1700, when King William III lived there. An estimated half-million
tourists visit it each year.
   In Rydal, Pa., H. Thomas Hallowell Jr. built himself a smaller
version of the Hampton Court Maze in the 1940s as a way to use
1,600 English boxwood plants. It, too, is still in fine shape,
though it is not usually open to the public.
   Anyone can see the labyrinth in New Harmony, Ind. It is a
replica, or possibly the original, planted there by the Harmonists,
or Rappites, followers of the German separatist George Rapp. Rapp
founded this separatist model community on the Wabash River in the
early 19th century but later moved on, leaving his maze, which may
have symbolized obstacles that have to be overcome to find the
meaning of life. The tower in the center _ rough on the exterior,
attractively furnished within _ symbolized ultimate achievement.
   And Colonial Williamsburg, visited by countless people every
year, also has a maze, at the Governor's Palace.
   But how about making your own knot garden, topiary figures or
maze?
   The knot garden probably will be the simplest.
   Here are some pointers from Bernard Currid in ``Herbs &amp; Their
Ornamental Uses,'' published by the Brooklyn (N.Y.) Botanic Garden:
   First, draw a plan, visualizing both pattern and color. Mark it
off in squares, covering the dimensions of the available plot.
   In planning, remember that most of the herbs you'll be using
like light, well-drained soil and full sun.
   Herbs should be compact by nature and able to withstand
trimming. And the foliage should be sufficiently varied in color to
delineate the various features of the knot.
   Plants mentioned by Currid include gray and green santolinas,
germander, winter savory (a form of lemon thyme with leaves edged
in white), hyssop, Roman wormwood, edging box, dwarf forms of
lavender and golden variegated sage.
   Gardeners contemplating topiary should start by pruning the
plant roughly into shape, according to the BBG's handbook,
``Trained and Sculptured Plants.'' Once the plant is established,
yearly clipping is necessary to maintain and refine a clear
outline. But don't prune topiary in late autumn or winter in areas
where freezing weather may occur. It could damage the plant.
   Plants favored for topiary are boxwood, yew, hemlock, privet and
arborvitae. Privet is not an evergreen, and it may not look
attractive in winter.
   Topiary also needs plenty of water to keep it in shape during
hot summer weather, so the gardener who cannot supply it shouldn't
attempt it.
   For mazes, boxwood is a favorite plant. The labyrinth at New
Harmony is made of Amoor River privet, noted for its hardiness. The
Hampton Court maze is yew, and the Colonial Williamsburg maze is
holly.
   Patience is the key for these projects. It takes time for the
work to look its best.
   The boxwood plants in Hallowell's maze in Pennsylvania grow
about an inch each year. They were about 6 inches high when he
planted them in the 1940s and are now about four feet high.

   Should you seed your lawn in the spring or fall?
   Nature's way is usually best, and autumn seeding comes closest
to duplicating natural conditions, says Eliot C. Roberts of the
Lawn Institute in Pleasant Hill, Tenn.
   ``By this time of year temperatures are cooling off, days are
getting shorter and soil moisture is ideal for germination of seed
and early seedling establishment.
   ``At this time many annual weeds, like crabgrass, have finished
their growth cycles and will not compete with seedling lawngrass
plants,'' he adds.
   The ideal time to plant a new lawn or overseed one that has
suffered through an unfavorable summer is four to six weeks before
the first autumn frost. Lawns started or improved then will be
ready for sturdy growth through the fall.
   The Lawn Institute can provide names of lawngrasses for your
area. Send an SASE envelope to the institute at P.O. Box 108,
Pleasant Hill, Tenn, 38578.

   Warning: watering can be harmful to your lawn's health.
   Watering helps to keep your lawn green and healthy, but if you
don't do it right it can do more harm than good, gardening experts
say.
   Lawns only need about an inch of water each week to stay green,
says Linda Neill, a spokeswoman for the Gilmour Group, manufacturer
of lawn and garden products. Grass, like any other plant, can be
ruined by too much water. Only add what's needed when natural
rainfall hasn't done the job.
   Climatic factors, such as temperature, wind velocity, humidity
and the frequency of rain, along with choice of soil and grass
types, will dictate water needs, she says.
   For best results, water when the soil has dried 2 to 6 inches
deep, the company advises. Another way to tell when a lawn needs
watering is to watch the grass, noting when it shows signs of
wilting or has lost its normal green color.
   Other watering tips:
   _ The best time to water a lawn is early morning, although late
night may be equally effective in some areas.
   _ Different soil types need different watering schedules. Clay
soils hold more water, while sandy soils drain more quickly and
need to be watered more often.
   _ Mowing the grass too short puts it under stress and creates a
shallow root system. Shallow roots do not absorb moisture well. Set
the mower blades higher and mow less frequently so grass roots will
grow deeper into the soil.

   Here is a four-season recipe for producing a nice green lawn.
   Experts at O.M. Scott &amp; Sons Co., lawn specialists, recommend
feeding your lawn four times a year for best results.
   Early Spring: By the end of April, your lawn is on the move.
Grass plants send out new shoots from their bases, underground
rhizomes form offshoot plants, and new roots tap moisture and
nutrients. Gardeners then stimulate this activity by applying
nutrients at about this time.
   Unfortunately, crabgrass and other annual weeds also are on the
move. That's why Scott recommends applying a combination lawn
fertilizer and crabgrass preventer. Apply the product by the fourth
mowing or before temperatures are regularly in the 80s.
   When planting a new lawn or repairing major bare spots, use a
special fertilizer formulated for starting seeds, sod or sprigs.
   Late Spring: By June, grass plants will have consumed nutrients
applied earlier. Another feeding helps grass stay green, thick and
fortified through the hot, tough summer months ahead.
   It's likely that a few extras like dandelions, plantain and
clover will appear on your lawn. Wait until these weeds are
actively growing before clearing them out. Since rapid weed growth
usually occurs in time for the second lawn feeding, it makes sense
to use a good combination broadleaf weed control plus fertilizer at
this time.
   Summer: During June, July and August, your lawn will probably
endure heat and perhaps a few insects. Replenishing the nutrient
supply at this time will stimulate top growth thinned by heat and
lack of moisture. Nutrients will also promote production of new
leaves and offshoot plants. Insects will thrive near the root zone,
so apply a combination insect control plus fertilizer product and
water it in to carry active ingredients down to the root zone.
   Late Fall: The year's last feeding should be applied by
November. This helps winterize the lawn and keep it greener longer
as winter approaches. Also, grass plants fed in fall produce and
store carbohydrates for immediate use in early spring, allowing the
lawn to green and thicken earlier and faster.
   Four feedings are suggested for most grass varieties, including
Kentucky bluegrass, ryegrass, fescue and St. Augustine grass. There
are a few exceptions. Apply three feedings (spring, summer and
fall) to centipedegrass, zoysia or Bahia grass. Five feedings are
recommended for Bermuda grass in Florida and mixed dichondragrass
lawns.
   Because they turn green sooner in spring and stay green longer
in the fall than other grasses, cool season grasses are recommended
for northern areas.
   Zoysia and Bermuda grass are used through much of the transition
zone between North and South, even though their growth period is
shortened by cool spring and fall weather. In these instances,
their increased tolerance of summer heat and drought stress make
them more reasonable to maintain.
   In more northern locations, Bermuda grasses not only have a
short growing season but also are more subject to winter kill.
Zoysias are hardier in winter but growth usually is restricted to
the frost-free period.
   In choosing a grass for your lawn, bluegrases, fine fescues,
perennial ryegrasses, turf-type tall fescues and colonial
bentgrasses will provide longer periods of green turf in northern
locations.
   These same grasses are adapted to fall, winter and spring
conditions in the transition zone and upper South. But they suffer
from hot summer conditions and are increasingly difficult to keep
healthy further south. Zoysia and Bermuda grass are used
effectively in these locations.

   Environmentalist researchers are seeking new answers to the
question of what to do with grass clippings from mowing the lawn.
   According to estimates of the Environmental Protection Agency,
grass clippings and leaves account for more than 18 percent of
household waste sent to landfills, most of it grass clippings.
   Most homeowners bag the clippings, but a ``Don't Bag It'' study
from the Texas Agricultural Extension Service says that lawns
actually become healthier when the grass clippings are left there.
   In the test, 150 Fort Worth, Texas, homeowners spent the summer
of 1989 mowing their lawns with identical side-discharge Toro
lawnmowers. At the end of the summer, participants rated their
lawns 30 percent healthier than when they were bagging clippings.
   According to Bill Knoop, turfgrass specialist for the extension
service, Tampa, Fla., Minneapolis and Los Angeles are among cities
trying similar programs.
   Another test program was begun last May to compare the benefits
of a mulching mower to bagging behind a walk-behind mower.
   The continuing tests are being conducted by Garden Way Inc. and
the Rodale Research Center in Kutztown, Pa. In the testing, two
identical grass-covered plots will be mowed on a weekly basis, one
with a Bolens walk-behind mulching mower and the other with a
Bolens walk-behind rear bagging model.
   The grass on each plot will be cut the same way each week, at
2-to 3-inch heights. Soil cores will be taken before and after each
growing season, then analyzed by the research center staff and
Pennsylvania State University.
   The experiment is being conducted ``because the disposal of
grass clippings has become a major environmental concern for
communities all across the country,'' says David Lessard, vice
president of product and brand management for Garden Way. ``We
believe a mulching mower can offer a very viable and effective
solution, and we wanted to objectively and quantitatively verify
previous assertions that mulching returns increased nitrogen and
nutrients to the soil, making chemical fertilizer unnecessary.''
   Knoop has this advice for mowing:
   _ Mow every five or six days and don't remove more than
one-third of the grass blade service.
   _ Use a recycling lawnmower, which has a special deck that cuts
and recuts clippings and forces them back into the lawn.
   _ Fertilize only so grass grows at a reasonable rate; use a
slow-release fertilizer.
   _ Aerate each spring to open up soil and allow greater movement
of water, fertilizer and air; this increases the speed of grass
clipping decomposition.
   _ Don't over-water. During the driest period of summer, lawns
require one inch of water every five to six days.

   Before all else in gardening is the soil.
   Healthy garden plants need soil that's full of organic material,
is neutral and drains well. This ideal soil, however, is hard to
come by, and you probably will have to make up the deficits in your
garden earth. The Canadian Spagnum Peat Moss News Bureau says the
task isn't as daunting as it sounds and offers some advice for soil
improvements:
   _ First analyze your soil's texture. If it runs through your
fingers, it's too sandy, which will allow water and nutrients to
drain off too quickly. If the soil is thick, lumpy and clinging,
you probably have a high clay content. Plant roots will have a hard
time penetrating this soil and may starve from lack of air and
water. You can improve texture of any soil by adding organic
materials, such as grass clippings, straw, hay, wood shavings,
chopped leaves, dehydrated manure, or sphagnum peat moss. Work a
layer 2 inches thick into the soil. Add it in the spring before
planting and in the fall after harvesting.
   _ Check your soil's pH, or balance between alkalinity or
acidity. You can do this with a kit available at garden centers.
These will measure the balance on a scale of one to 14, with pH 7
representing a neutral balance. Numbers below this indicate
alkaline levels, and numbers above represent acidity levels. (The
numbers are geometrically progressive, so a pH 5 reading is ten
times as acidic as pH 6.)
   Lawns, vegetables and most flowers prefer a neutral or slightly
acid soil. Soil that is too acid, commonly found in the Northeast,
can leach out calcium and magnesium. This can be countered by
adding ground limestone, using about 2{ pounds per 100 square feet
of light soil, or 3{ pounds of hydrated lime or 6 pounds of ground
limestone per 100 square feet of heavy soil to improve the pH by
one unit. Alkaline soil, often found in the Southwest, can be
balanced with agricultural sulfur. About a half-pound per 100
square feet of light soil or 2 pounds per square feet of heavy soil
will lower the pH by one unit.
   _ Make sure your soil has adequate nutrients. The major ones are
nitrogen (N), phosophorus (P) and potassium of potash (K).
   When shopping for fertilizer, note that the bags are labeled
with three-number formulas indicating the balance between these
elements. The first number represents nitrogen, which encourages
growth of plant tissue. To boost nitrogen content, condition the
soil with a mixture of organic material that includes aged manure.
Phosphorous (the second number) stimulates cell development,
fruiting, and disease resistance. To add phosphorus, rake bone meal
into the soil. Potassium (the third number) helps plants form
starches and sugars and helps them resist disease and drought. Wood
ashes are a good source of potassium.
   Fertilizer that's marked 5-10-10 or 10-10-10 is most suitable,
assuming your soil has had sulfur or lime added and is close to
neutral.
   _ Put mulch _ a thick layer of organic material _ around
developing plants to help cut down the amount of water and weeding
needed. Straw, ground garden refuse, bark and Canadian peat make
good mulches.
   _ Boost your soil with compost, which is decomposed organic
matter such as vegetable peelings, lawn and garden debris, and
coffee grounds. Mixed with Canadian peat, they make excellent
nutrients.

<TEXT>
   Trees and shrubs, especially those whose roots may have been
damaged in droughts of recent years, need deep watering, often for
several hours.
   Symptoms of root damage include dieback and early leaf fall.
   It may take about 15 gallons of water to penetrate soil a foot
deep for an average tree, depending on the type of soil, how damp
it already is, and the water pressure used.
   One way to be sure water penetrates to the roots is with a root
feeder, a sharp hollow spike about 30 inches long.
   A nutrition cartridge, to be dissolved in the water, can be fed
through the spike. Continue soaking until the soil is sufficiently
saturated to help the plant food solution spread through the
sub-surface soil. Clay soils absorb more water and retain it longer
below the surface. Sandy soils take less water but need it more
often.
   Perforations made in the soil by a root feeding device should
extend beyond the tree canopy at depths of 8 to 12 inches. The
performations also allow better penetration of rain water and
provide air, especially in compacted soils.
   One root feeder is available from Ross Daniels of West Des
Moines, Iowa.

   Heather, celebrated in literature, captured in scents, and
emulated in colors, also is being used by some gardeners for
year-round pleasure.
   Writing in a recent issue of Fine Gardening magazine, Joyce
Descloux describes her garden of various heathers, also called
calluna: ``In spring, the tips of the young shoots are brightly
colored. ... Others have green foliage that stays bright in winter,
but most turn plum, purple or almost black during cold weather.
There are varieties with foliage that stays gold all year, and
others with gold foliage in summer that changes to shades of vivid
orange, crimson or dark red for the winter months.''
   Closely associated with the moors of the British Isles and
Western Europe, where these woody plants grow wild, most heathers
are easy to cultivate and maintain, according to Ms. Descloux, who
edits Heather News, journal of the North American Heather Society.
Because it has naturally adapted to nutrient-poor soils, heather
doesn't need fertilizer. It forms cooperative relationships with
soil fungi, which break down nutrients in acid soil for the host
plant in exchange for carbohydrates manufactured by the plant.
``Heather grows best in soil much leaner than you'd provide for
most other flowering perennials,'' says Ms. Descloux.
   Some varieties grow to three feet, others grow only half that
height and spread horizontally, often trailing down rocks and
slopes. Most plants thrive well in cool, moist climates with
temperatures between 40 and 80 degrees. But Ms. Descloux says they
can endure more extreme conditions if they are properly sited and
cared for.
   ``Their foliage begins to assume winter color with the first
autumn chill. The colder it gets, the more intense the colors
become,'' she writes.

   Nut trees are not difficult to grow, and they make ideal
dual-purpose additions to your garden. They are attractive and
shady, and in time they will provide a bonus of nuts.
   Nut trees need no more care than a common maple or oak, and they
are long-lived. Most are deep-rooting and thus little affected by
vagaries of seasons and pests.
   Spring is the best time for planting in most areas, though you
can prepare the site in the fall. Start by digging a hole three
feet in diameter and two feet deep. Fill it with good top soil
which has been mixed with peat moss or other humus and some cow
manure. If the soil is poor, add a generous amount of good
vegetable fertilizer.
   You'll have a good choice of trees to plant, but check your
county agricultural extension service for advice on the best for
your region.
   Possibilities include the Thomas black walnut, which is hardy,
bears when young, and produces large, easy-to-crack nuts. The
Carpathian, an English walnut, is hardy, fast growing and is good
for shade; it's recommended you plant two for pollination.
   If almonds are suitable to your area, you might try Hall's.
These trees are small, growing to about 15 feet wide and tall. They
can be grown in any area where peach trees thrive. Other small
varieties include filberts and hazelnuts, which grow to about 12 or
15 feet.
   Pecan trees will grow much larger. An old variety is Stuart,
which can reach 40 to 50 feet, bearing thin-shelled fruit.

   Home gardeners may be getting short shrift from seed producers,
with low and uneven yields resulting from individual packets,
writes Steve Solomon in the January-February issue of Harrowsmith,
a garden and farm magazine.
   Some major seed growers consider small retailers and home
gardeners as an ``uncritical trade,'' according to Solomon, an
author and mail-order seed merchandiser. ``Gardeners are such
pushovers as customers that the trade has a saying, `The gardener
gets the sweepings off the seedroom floor.'''
   Most seeds are produced by what Solomon terms primary growers,
usually big corporations that are almost unknown to the gardening
public. They sell to the seed merchandisers, who in turn package
and market the seeds to the public.
   Solomon says that commercial farmers, who account for the
largest part of the primary growers' profits, have the most clout
and get the cream of the seed crops.
   Many seed catalog firms offer well-tested, quality seeds that
have been grown under controlled conditions. But many others do
not, and because ungerminated seeds look alike, the individual
consumer takes his chances. Solomon says consumer protection laws
set standards too low. ``Seeds so weak that they will barely come
up in the field, despite the best possible sprouting conditions,
can still be above the minimum standard germination,'' he writes.
   He advises gardeners to avoid bargains and pay top price for
seeds. ``The cost of seed is small compared with the value it can
create, and it takes the same amount of fertilizer, water, tillage
and work to grow vegetables using bad seed as it does using good.''
He also recommends buying from companies who operate trial gardens
in a climate similar to your own.

   The space age tomato is nearly here.
   About 12.5 million tomato seeds that orbited Earth for six years
in NASA's LDEF (for Long Duration Exposure Facility) satellite are
being put into the hands of millions of students, who will carry
out experiments to find out what effect space exposure has on
space-exposed seeds.
   ``There is no precedent to predict how the seed has been
affected on the LDEF satellite,'' says Dr. Jim Alston, research
director for Park Seed Company, which is cooperating with NASA and
Langley Research Center in the experiment. Alston thinks the seeds
on the satellite, deployed by the shuttle orbiter Challenger in
l984 and retrieved by the space shuttle Columbia in December, will
remain viable.
   An estimated 4 million students and 40,000 educators around the
world will carry out experiments under a program called SEEDS
(Space Exposed Experiment Developed for Students). Complexity will
depend on grade level. Students in elementary classes, for example,
will grow and compare the flight seed with the Earth-based seed,
while secondary-level students will work with lights and
hydroponics. University students will look at genetics and plant
breeding. NASA will publish a summary of the findings.
   Alston selected tomatoes because the vegetable is widely grown
and recognized and because he estimated the density of the seeds
would be right for the number required for the experiment. He
picked the Rutgers, an open-pollinated variety, because it ``breeds
true,'' which means the offspring are just like the parents through
successive generations. Mutations from radiation exposure would be
easier for students to identify and isolate in this strain.
   Educators who want their classes to participate in the
experiment should request kits, stating class level, from NASA
SEEDS Project, Educational Affairs Division, Code XEO, NASA,
Washington, D.C. 20546.

   You bought that Easter lily plant (or the tulips, hyacinths,
tiger lilies, oriental star gazers or sans souci lilies) for the
holiday. Now what?
   Design your own Easter floral arrangement, advises Heffernan
Morgan, a Chicago floral design firm. Get rid of the pots they came
in and rearrange multiple bulbs and soil in shallow containers such
as baking dishes, woven baskets, ramekins, or anything else that
suits your fancy. Cluster Easter fruits and eggs around the plants,
nestled atop green Spanish or reindeer moss. Finish with raffia,
twine or birch branches.
   Once the holiday is over, the firm says, you can bring the bulbs
back to life for another season. Remove the dead flowers, then let
the foliage shrivel and remove it. Store the bulbs in a cool, dark,
dry area. You can then replant them in your garden in the fall
before the first frost, or plant them indoors in pots, beginning to
water them in February.

   The butterflies that visit your garden are its natural allies.
   Butterflies are attracted to gardens, playing a mutually
beneficial role with the plants. Flowers produce the nectar needed
by butterflies, and butterflies in turn pollinate flower plants.
   Because natural hibernating sites for butterflies such as native
woods are diminishing due to development, threatening butterfly
populations, some gardeners are installing butterfly hibernation
boxes to simulate the natural crevices in which the creatures
hibernate. These boxes are set up in the shade, near trees.
   A ready-made butterfly box from the Brown Company of West
Kingston, R. I., is made from untreated, rough-hewn western red
cedar, is weather-resistant, and comes with a mounting pole. The
top can be removed to add tree bark or dried pine bark mulch.

   Allergy sufferers who have problems with pollen outdoors can
enjoy plants indoors as long as they don't overdo it, says a
University of Oklahoma clinical professor of medicine.
   Plant lovers ``can have their cake and eat it, too,'' when it
comes to having a green thumb indoors, says to Dr. John Bozalis of
the university's Health Sciences Center.
   ``Plants can be a problem if a person is especially sensitive to
mold spores. We aren't too concerned about indoor plants because
most of them don't pollinate and cause problems,'' he says.
   ``The exception to that are flowers in the ragweed family, such
as chrysanthemums. Some people can have bad reactions to them. Keep
in mind that people can have non-allergic (irritant) reactions to
some odors of flowers, such as honeysuckle.''
   Bozalis, a partner in the Oklahoma Allergy Clinic, says there is
some concern about those who have many plants in their homes.
   ``Plants need water, and the moist soil grows mold, the spores
of which are picked up and spread through the house, causing
allergic reactions,'' he explains.
   Six or eight plants are usually all right for allergy sufferers,
Bozalis says. Mold levels won't be high enough to cause trouble
unless there is a hidden problem, such as a leaky pipe in a wall.
   Allergic reactions to plants are usually seasonal and can be
attributed to tree or grass pollination, he notes.
   Bozalis says one clue to indoor allergic reactions is whether
someone has problems year-round.
   ``These can be caused by animals, house dust or mold,'' he says.
   ``There's nothing better to determine the cause of an allergic
reaction than for a patient to just sit down with a physician and
do a thorough personal history.''

<TEXT>
   A chain saw is useful for cleanup and maintenance of your yard
and garden, but observe some basics for safe and easy operation.
Solo Incorporated, which makes chain saws, has these tips:
   _ When starting the chain saw, place it on level ground at least
10 feet from the gas can and fueling area. Hold the saw down by
placing one foot on the rear handlebar while firmly holding the
front handlebar with one hand. If your saw has only a top
handlebar, hold it firmly on the ground, pulling up on the starting
grip.
   _ Hold the saw firmly with both hands, maintaining a secure
grip. This will help you avoid injury from kickback. Don't
overreach or cut above shoulder height, and when cutting logs, only
cut one at a time.
   _ In bucking timber, don't stand directly behind the saw while
cutting. Position yourself so you'll be away from the direction of
the log roll. Hold the saw on the right side of your body (outside
the line of sight across the chain) to minimize chances of injury
from an unexpected broken chain or kickback. Examine the log for
internal stress _ a bowed appearance is an indication _ and avoid
cutting the log on the wrong side, which can result in kickback.
   _ To avoid kickback while limbing, make sure the log is in a
secure position and work on the safest side _ usually uphill and
away from the fall of cut limbs. To avoid kickback, make sure the
guidebar's tip doesn't come in contact with another branch, the
side of a tree, or another object. When limbing, bend your knees
slightly and position your right leg behind the front carrying
handlebar. The left leg should be forward and away from the
guidebar's contact range. Avoid standing on limbs, slash or debris.
   _ Survey the area before felling a tree. Is the trunk sound or
hollow and rotted? What's the wind direction and speed? Which
direction is the tree leaning in? Is the tree's crown denser and
heavier on one side? When you've determined the answers to these
questions, figure your escape route, which should be at a 45-degee
angle back from the line of the fall. When you have checked this
and cleared the small limbs and branches from the bottom portion of
the trunk, you're ready to fell the tree. Stand away from the tree
and maintain a balanced stance. Then start by making a careful
undercut. This notch, cut to a depth of a quarter-inch, will
determine the line of the fall and should be positioned at a right
angle to the projected fall.
   _ Wear protective clothing each time you use a saw. These
include goggles or a face mask, snug but comfortable work clothing,
cuffless long pants, hearing protection, non-slip safety gloves,
and boots with steel toecaps.

   Some flowering plants need help to extend their lives. Cyclamen,
hydrangea, azalea, cineraria and calceolaria (also known as
pocketbook plant) will bloom longer if you turn the light up and
the heat down. These plants prefer bright window spots and
temperatures of 60-65 degrees. Chrysanthemums do well in more
moderate temperatures _ up to 75 degrees during the day.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   You can make potted plants reflower outdoors (but not very well
inside) with patience. Plants like tulips, hyacinths, narcissus and
crocus are forced to bloom out of season in controlled conditions
at the greenhouse, so to bloom again they need a rest period and
natural outdoor environments. To reflower, first remove the faded
blooms and keep the plants in a cool, bright place until the
foliage matures and dries out. Then plant the bulbs outdoors when
the danger of frost is past, two or three times deeper than the
bulbs' diameters. They should bloom in a year or two during the
normal spring season.

   Too much fertilizer on house plants is worse than too little. It
can burn the roots of troubled plants. Fertilizer salts can build
up and form crusty white residues, which can harm plants. Be sure
to follow dosages recommended on fertilizer packages. Slow-growing
plants need less than fast-growing ones, and all types will grow
faster in spring and summer when they get more light from longer
days. If salts accumulate, leach them out of the soil by watering
heavily, allowing excess water and residue to drain off.

<TEXT>
   How often should you water your plants? As often as they need
it. Most houseplants need water when soil feels dry to the touch.
You also can judge by the weight of the pot; a light pot means the
soil is dry. Or insert a probe; if soil clings to it when you pull
it out, that means the bottom soil is moist. You also can tap the
plant; a hollow sound means dry soil. When watering, do it
thoroughly, but be sure to allow for drainage and empty the saucers
of excess water. Avoid overwatering, as it damages roots and causes
yellowing and loss of lower leaves. Check with the florist or
garden center where you bought the plant for recommended watering
schedules.

   Can you grow vegetables in shade? While most need six to eight
hours of sun every day, some leafy crops such as lettuce and other
salad greens will grow in partial shade with two to three hours of
sun daily. Also try endive, spinach, Swiss chard, parsley,
tarragon, catnip and mint.

   Growing asparagus takes a little patience, with root
establishment taking more than a month and three years needed for
harvest maturity. Start by planting crowns and spreading roots in a
trench 6 to 8 inches deep, covering with about 3 to 4 inches of
soil to start. Fill in with more soil as the shoots grow. When
mature, you can harvest freely for about six to eight weeks,
cutting off spears at the soil surface level. Then let the stalks
grow to make food for plant roots.

   Spring is a good time to repot indoor plants. If roots are
showing on the pot bottoms, it means the pot is full of roots and
needs more room. Move the plant to a pot one size larger. First
knock out the root ball on a newspaper, place it in the larger pot
prepared with drainage material, then sift in loose potting soil
around the root ball. Firm down as you fill the pot, but don't
cover the root ball any deeper than it was previously. Water well.
Place the plant in a low-light area for a few days, then return it
to its regular window spot. Don't feed it for several weeks.

   Tomatoes may develop cracks as summer rolls on, especially after
heavy rain or watering after a dry spell. That's because the tissue
takes up water greedily and expands faster than the skin. These
tomatoes are more likely to rot on the vine. To prevent cracking,
keep the plants mulched and water regularly.

   If you live near the shore, you know that seawater can set back
many crops. But Organic Gardening Magazine reports that it can
improve tomato flavor without sacrificing much of the yield. In
past experiments with seawater, plants fed with varying dilutions
of seawater in all seasons developed sweeter but smaller and fewer
tomatoes. But the Journal of the American Society for Horticultural
Science reports that Israeli scientists have found that timing is
all-important. They irrigated trial plants with salty water only
after fruits had formed. The tomatoes were better quality, with
higher sugar concentration than those raised on plain water.

   You need mulch? North Carolina's Mecklenburg County is giving it
away.
   Since October, workers have been grinding 140 tons of mulch a
day from limbs and trees felled by Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Come and get it,'' says Bill Warren, county operations
supervisor for recycling. ``We're grinding more than we can give
away.''
   For gardeners, the woody pulp is ideal for landscaping. It keeps
moisture in and weeds out. As the mulch decays, it enriches the
soil.
   The county once charged $15 a pickup load. But until all Hugo
debris is ground up, the stuff is free for the taking.
   After four months, the county had ground up only one-fifth of
Hugo's debris. The task probably will continue through autumn, says
Fred Remington, division manager of recycling. Mulch will then go
back on sale as part of the county's recycling program.

   A surprisingly large 30 percent trade-balance
improvement in December allowed the nation to close out 1989 with a
$108.6 billion deficit, the smallest in five years, the government
said.
   Private economists noted, however, that while U.S. exports hit
an all-time high last year, so did imports, driven upward by
America's growing dependence on foreign oil.
   Some economists forecast Friday the deficit this year will
worsen as consumers continue to buy imported products and the
foreign oil bill rises.

   The Federal Reserve said Friday the production slump was the

attributed the decrease to a drop in energy use due to abnormally
warm weather and to temporary layoffs in the automobile industry to
correct bloated inventories.

   The dollar was lower in early European trading
today, but currency dealers predicted no major swings because of
the Presidents Day holiday in the United States.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   Traders said Sunday's Japanese elections were in line with their
expectations and had no appreciable impact on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar slipped 0.03 yen to a closing 144.52 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 144.48 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.6730 West German marks, down from 1.6794;
1.4883 Swiss francs, down from 1.4930; 5.6905 French francs, down
from 5.7045; 1.8861 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8915; 1,242.50
Italian lire, down from 1,246.00; and 1.2000 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1997.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.7010, compared with $1.6953 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.35 a troy ounce, up
from $416.65 late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major bullion
dealers fixed a recommended price of $416.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $416.90, up from $416.50 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid
$416.24.
   Bullion dealers said gold moved higher on some light Asian
buying, but the level of interest had moderated and dealings were
expected to become increasingly thin as the European day progressed.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.34 a troy ounce, from
Friday's $5.36.

<HEAD>Production Winds Down At Campbell's Oldest Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE BURNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The site where Joseph Campbell spawned a
food products revolution has stopped canning soup for the first
time in 121 years.
   In two weeks, production will grind to a halt at Campbell Soup
Co.'s oldest manufacturing plant, marking another significant step
in the company's march toward modernity.
   For this economically strapped city across the Delaware River
from Philadelphia, the closing of a plant that employs 1,000
workers ushers in an uneasy time in its crucial revitalization
efforts. There are concerns that Campbell might abandon plans for a
new headquarters building here, as well as doubts about the
company's ability to remain independent.
   To Campbell's officials, the plant's end was long overdue.
   ``It's like any other industry _ if you're doing anything like
you were 50 years ago, you're out of date,'' said company spokesman
James Moran. ``It's just a plant whose time who has come. No amount
of money would make it competitive.''
   Workers at the plant still load ingredients onto an elevator and
transport them to different floors. Renovation would have cost
millions but still would not have brought the facility up to par
with Campbell's modern, one-floor production plants elsewhere,
officials said.
   The closing is part of a worldwide restructuring Campbell
announced last August that will eliminate 2,800 jobs as well as
plants in Maryland and Tennessee. The reorganization is expected to
save the company about $15 million during fiscal 1990 and about
$150 million over the next four years.
   Negotiations on severance agreements are continuing in Camden.
Production from the plant will be taken up by plants in Napoleon,
Ohio; Paris, Texas and Maxton, N.C.
   Many of the blue-collar employees at the downtown plant have
worked there most of their lives.
   ``Most of these people assumed they would be here for a while,''
said Alvin Still, president of Local 80 of the United Food and
Commercial Workers, which represents about 640 of the hourly
employees in the plant.
   Still, who has worked at the plant for more than 40 years, said
an estimated 230 employees will qualify for a pension plan. The
future is uncertain for the others, he said.
   ``We don't want to leave this company with our heads between our
legs,'' Still said. ``We want to walk straight with dignity.''
   There will be no fanfare when the last can rolls off the
production line at the site where icebox maker Abram Anderson and
fruit merchant Joseph Campbell began canning vegetables, jellies
and mincemeat in 1869.
   The original building was replaced by a brick facility in 1896,
and the first condensed soups began production the following year.
   ``The symbolism is already over,'' said Moran. ``The plant is
winding down.''
   During its heyday, the eight-story plant produced 10 million
cans of red and white labeled soup varieties daily in the 1930s.
Recent, output has averaged about 1 million cans a day of Prego
spaghetti sauce, Franco-American pasta and beans.
   Campbell has been a mainstay in this economically depressed city
of 85,000, with its four huge soup cans prominent on the skyline.
   Campbell officials maintain the headquarters will remain here.
Plans are underway to begin construction this year on a $35
million, 200,000-foot international headquarters on the city's
waterfront.
   Nevertheless, David Johnson, who became the first outsider to
head the company when he took over as president in January, met
last week with Gov. Jim Florio and said plans for the new
headquarters remain under review.
   The possibility that Campbell will back out concerns lawmakers.
The headquarters is considered vital to a $500 million waterfront
project that includes a $42 million state aquarium.
   ``You would lose that symbolic stability that a company like
Campbell brings,'' said Mayor Aaron A. Thompson. ``It will be a
slowdown for the redevelopment.''
   Johnson was hired to help change Campbell's image as an industry
laggard, slow to update facilities and products. The company's
dominance in the retail soup market has dropped in recent years and
Campbell has had trouble in the fast-growing dry soup market.
   For years, John T. Dorrance Jr., the son of the
chemist-turned-entrepreneur who invented condensed soup in 1897,
was reluctant to close plants or lay off workers.
   Since his death last April, the company has undergone massive
changes, including a split in the founder's family that has fueled
speculation that about a possible sale of the company.
   Three grandchildren of John T. Dorrance Sr., who own 17.4
percent of Campbell stock, have announced they want to sell. Three
other grandchildren who own 31.3 percent say they want to keep
their shares and maintain the company's independence.
   Campbell's fiscal 1989 earnings totaled $13 million, or 10 cents
a share, down sharply from a profit of $274.1 million, or $2.12 a
share, the previous year. The August restructuring reduced profits
by $343 million.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged today
as relief over the governing party's election victory gave way to
concern over higher interest rates, and the dollar edged down
against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.52 yen, down 0.03 yen from Friday's
144.55-yen finish. It opened at 144.28 yen and ranged between
144.10 yen and 144.58 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 237.72 points, or 0.63
percent, closing at 37,222.60.
   The index, which lost 11.67 points Friday, climbed almost 150
points in early trading today as results from Sunday's election
showed the pro-business Liberal Democratic Party retaining a
comfortable margin in Parliament's lower house.
   ``The election results did reassure market players and prompted
buying, but it lasted only temporarily,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a
senior dealer at Nikko Securities Co.
   ``As soon as investors felt relieved, their concern quickly
shifted to the possibility of yet another discount rate hike,'' he
said, and the index headed downward.
   In addition, the governing party's victory had been anticipated
in the market ``since last week,'' said Yuji Kawakami, an analyst
with Nomura Securities Co.
   ``Some people say the rate hike may come very soon, and others
say it will come sometime in spring,'' he said, adding that market
players are gradually getting ready.
   The official discount rate, the interest charged by the Bank of
Japan on loans to commercial banks, now stands at 4.25 percent
after three increases last year. Higher interest rates tend to
discourage stock purchases.
   Shimoyama added that declines in Japanese government bond prices
and futures stock prices accelerated the Nikkei's fall.
   In currency dealings, traders said the governing party's
election victory did not strengthen the yen against other
currencies today.
   ``It was because market players bought back the dollar to make
up their short-cover, or oversold, positions from last Friday,''
said Koichi Amaya, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Investors had bought the Japanese currency based on optimistic
predictions for the LDP's victory,'' he said.
   Amaya said the discount rate rumor did not help support the yen.
   ``The market doesn't have enough energy to buy more yen and push
it higher,'' he said.

   The widespread adoption of existing
energy-saving technology could cut U.S. energy use by 75 percent,
solving the global-warming problem profitably, a researcher says.
   Improvements in energy-efficient devices have come along so
quickly that they ``now create astonishing potential savings,''
said Amory Lovins, director of research at the Rocky Mountain
Institute in Snowmass, Colo.
   He said his studies show the proper use of energy efficiency can
outpace the current growth in the world's population, which stands
at 5.3 billion.
   A world of 8 billion people with a standard of living equal to
that of West Germany and an economy five times the current size
could survive on one-third the energy that is being consumed
worldwide now, Lovins said.
   Lovins said his extensive calculations show proven energy-saving
technology can save 80 percent of the oil the United States burns
each year and can cut U.S. electricity use by 75 percent.
   The burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil has left
elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and enhanced
the atmosphere's ability to trap the sun's heat, a process called
the greenhouse effect.
   Scientists generally agree that this process will noticeably
raise average global temperatures, perhaps in the next few decades,
producing environmental disruption and unpredictable weather
changes.
   Most experts have assumed the shift away from fossil fuels to
prevent global warming will be costly and difficult, but Lovins
argued otherwise.
   ``Far from being costly, abating global warming should, on the
whole, be immensely profitable,'' he wrote in a study he described
Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.
   ``Improving energy productivity can save the world upwards of a
trillion dollars per year _ as much as the global military
budget,'' he wrote.
   The utility industry and others say Lovins has exaggerated the
savings from improved energy efficiency.
   One-fourth of the electricity savings would come from
improvements in lighting, one-fourth from improvements in motors,
and another quarter from energy-efficient appliances and other
equipment, Lovins said.
   In the case of lighting, the replacement of existing equipment
with new reflectors, lenses, lamps, controls and maintenance
methods would create as much light as is provided now, but with
just 8 percent of today's electrical use, Lovins said.
   Lovins long has championed greater energy efficiency, and
published in 1977 a widely quoted book called ``Soft Energy Paths.''

   A Chinese company ordered by President Bush to
sell a Seattle aircraft parts company protested the decision
Monday, saying it would jeopardize Sino-U.S. relationships in the
aviation industry.
   The state-owned China National Aero-Technology Import and Export
Corp., or CATIC, said the divestiture order ``will undoubtedly
cause negative impact on future cooperation between the aviation
industries of the two countries.''
   Citing national security considerations, Bush ordered CATIC on
Feb. 2 to sell Mamco Manufacturing Co. He acted on the
recommendation of an interagency panel that found the Seattle
company was involved in sensitive materials that could have
military applications.
   Bush said his action was based on one particular transaction and
that his administration continues to welcome direct investment from
China and other countries.
   However, the move was seen as an effort by Bush to mute
criticism from Congress that he has been too quick to restore ties
with the Beijing government following its harsh suppression of the
pro-democracy movement last spring.
   It was the first time Bush invoked a provision of a 1988 trade
law giving the president power to restrict foreign investment if
U.S. security is at risk.
   CATIC, in a statement issued by the official Xinhua News Agency,
said its 1988 purchase of Mamco was ``solely a commercial activity
in the area of civilian aircraft manufacture'' and complied with
federal and local laws in the United States.
   It said Mamco makes ordinary precision machinery for general
manufacturing purposes and the acquisition ``does not involve any
high technology leakage, nor does it impair or threaten the
national security of the United States.''
   CATIC was given three months to sell all its holdings in the
company, but may be granted a three-month extension.

   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
increased for the first time this year when it jumped by 19 rigs
this week to a total 918, officials said.
   Baker Hughes Inc. reported Monday the number of working rigs
remained well above the figures from a year ago when the nation's
rig count was posted at 766.
   Last week, the rig count dropped by 32 to 899, following several
weeks of decline. From the beginning of the year until this week,
the country had lost 167 working rigs.
   Experts had blamed the drop on a general seasonal decline.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Ike Kerridge, a Baker Hughes vice president and economist, has
said the rig count generally declines during the first quarter and
is expected to bottom out in March or April. He could not be
reached for comment Monday because of the holiday.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas flopped from having the
greatest drop last week with seven to having the greatest gain with
16 this week. Other states reporting gains include Louisiana with
10; Pennsylvania with five; Ohio with three; North Dakota with two;
and Colorado with a gain of one.
   Among states posting losses for the week, Wyoming showed the
greatest drop with a loss of 14; while Michigan lost four and New
Mexico was down two.
   There were no changes in the number of rigs operating in
Oklahoma, Kansas or California for the week.

   Stock prices fell sharply in a lackluster session
Monday on London's Stock Exchange.
   Dealers said they witnessed little outright selling, and said
the decline came as market makers cut prices to try to entice some
buying interest.
   With Wall Street shut for the Presidents Day holiday, they found
few takers for stocks even at the cheaper levels, dealers said.
   ``There's a dire lack of interest ...,'' said a director at a
large U.S. brokerage firm. ``Fund managers are using the day as an
excuse to do absolutely nothing.''
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was down 28.8 points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,297.1.
   Volume amounted to a very light 308.3 million shares, compared
with 438.8 million shares Friday.

<HEAD>Restaurant Managers, Analysts Debate Whether Perrier Can Revive
Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The distinctive green bottles of Perrier sparkling water that
once adorned every table at The Palm, a tony restaurant in
Washington, D.C., have been replaced by complimentary bottles of
Poland Spring water.
   In Nashville, Tenn., the manager at the French restaurant
Julian's is using last week's worldwide recall of Perrier as a
chance to introduce La Croix, a sparkling water from California, to
his customers.
   The recall of Perrier has reduced the choices of bottled waters
at The Four Seasons in New York from three to two, the sparkling
water San Pelligrino from Italy and the non-carbonated Evian from
France. But restaurant manager Julian Niccolini said there were no
protests.
   Restaurant owners across the country report few problems in
finding replacements for Perrier, the best-selling imported water
brand in the United States.
   That could be bad news for Source Perrier SA which recalled its
flagship brand from stores and restaurants worldwide last week
after discovering traces of benzene, a potentially toxic chemical,
in some of its bottles.
   Perrier became a symbol of trendy sophistication in the 1980s
and also benefitted from a move toward heightened health concerns.
   Like several other restaurant managers, Ray Jacomo of The Palm
in Washington said he will see what happens before putting Perrier
back on his tables when production resumes, but expects to carry
the brand again.
   ``It still has the best name. It's like Marlboro in cigarettes
or Hershey in chocolate bars,'' he said.
   But can Perrier still lay claim to a self-styled image of
pristine purity? And even if the company shows the drink being
bottled is pure, have its conflicting accounts of what caused the
contamination scarred the brand's reputation irreparably?
   When Source Perrier SA ordered a recall of its bottles in the
United States about 10 days ago, a company official was quoted as
saying an employee mistakenly used a product containing benzene,
the toxic chemical found in tiny amounts in some bottles, to clean
grease from a bottling line.
   But when it recalled its water from distribution worldwide last
Wednesday, Perrier said small amounts of benzene gas passed through
a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles at its natural spring
in southern France. It said workers had failed to change a pipe
filter that would have caught the gas.
   Beverage analysts were divided on whether Perrier can fully
recover.
   ``There is no way of predicting really,'' said Hellen Berry,
market research director for Beverage Marketing Corp., a New
York-based consulting firm. ``The longer they are off the market,
the more difficult it will be.''
   Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for Perrier Group of America Inc.,
Perrier's U.S. subsidiary in Greenwich, Conn., said it will take
two to three months for Perrier to be back in restaurants and
grocery shelves here.
   Jesse Meyers, publisher of the trade newsletter Beverage Digest
in Greenwich, Conn., said he thinks people will respect Source
Perrier for ordering the recall. ``I think the company can come
back stronger than ever before,'' he said.
   But Tom Pirko, president of the consulting company Bevmark Inc.
in Los Angeles, said he doubts the Perrier brand will regain its
prominence.
   He said in a subliminal sense, the public is now aware that the
water was contamainated where it was bottled and will likely
wonder, ``Maybe the filter works and maybe it doesn't.''
   ``I think Perrier has seen its day,'' Pirko said.
   According to Bevmark, the Perrier brand captured 5.7 percent of
the bottled water market estimated at $2.2 billion in wholesale
sales in 1988. Perrier was the third-best selling bottled water
here behind Arrowhead, also from Perrier, at 7.7 percent and
Sparkletts, from McKesson Corp. at 5.9 percent. Poland Spring,
another Perrier product, was fourth at 3.5 percent.
   Perrier was the clear leader among the imports, which accounted
for 9.8 percent of the total market, Bevmark said.
   At Julian's in Nashville, Manager Peter Marti suspects ``people
are going to be scared to drink Perrier for a while'' when it gets
back on the market.
   He said he wants to see how La Croix sells before deciding what
to do when Perrier gets back on the market. ``Maybe I would carry
them both to give them a choice,'' Marti said.
   Niccolini of The Four Seasons said ``it's going to take them a
lot of advertising and a lot of promotion to be able to get back as
strong as they were'' once production resumes.
   But he added, ``When they come back, we'll take them back.''

<HEAD>Dollar Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against other major currencies in
light European trading Monday as the West German mark gained ground.
   Gold prices were little changed.
   The Presidents Day holiday in the United States, where markets
were closed, reduced volume on European exchanges considerably,
dealers said.
   Dealers said the dollar fell against the mark on technical
factors. They also said continued speculation about an interest
rate hike by the West German central bank was generating interest
in the mark.
   The U.S. currency, however, gained modestly against the yen on
some short-covering after Sunday's national election in Tokyo.
   Short-covering is the buying of dollars to fulfill earlier
agreements to sell them.
   The dollar gained because the election victory of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party did not generate more buying in the yen,
which had advanced ahead of the election, dealers said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7030 from $1.6953 late
Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday's
rates, included: 1.6765 West German marks, down from 1.6794; 1.4885
Swiss francs, down from 1.4930; 5.6955 French francs, down from
5.7045; 1.8870 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8915; 1,243.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,246.00; and 1.1993 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1997.
   In Tokyo, where the dollar begins its day, the U.S. currency
slipped 0.03 yen to a closing 144.52 yen. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 144.60 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $416.50 a troy ounce
from $416.65 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $416.60, up from
$416.50 bid late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid
$416.24.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.33 a
troy ounce from $5.36 bid late Friday.

<HEAD>Drexel Burnham Lambert Cuts 210 Employees in Britain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fallout from the collapse of Drexel Burnham
Lambert continued Monday when three of the company's British units
dismissed 210 employees as part of an ``orderly wind-down'' of
operations.
   The workers joined 5,300 Drexel employees fired in the United
States on Friday after the investment firm's parent filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection.
   Administrators of the three British units, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Holdings Ltd., Drexel Burnham Lambert Ltd. and Drexel
Burnham Lambert Securities Ltd., said they would keep 84 employees
to close out the firms' affairs.
   Drexel's parent, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. of New York,
filed for protection from creditors last Tuesday when it defaulted
on some debt and banks refused to lend the company money.
   On Friday, KPMG Peat Marwick McLintock, the British arm of the
international accounting firm, was appointed administrator of the
units after Drexel filed petitions in British bankruptcy courts.
   The administrators said they have no involvement in either
Drexel Burnham Trading Ltd., which operates foreign exchange,
precious metals and oil trading operations, or Drexel Burnham
Lambert International Inc., a stock-loan operation, which are
``totally unaffected by events occurring in other parts of the
group.''
   Also Monday, Drexel's arm in Singapore said it had liquidated
all its positions on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange
and was scheduled to shut down by the end of this week.
   Officials of Drexel Burnham Lambert (S) Pte. Ltd., who declined
to be identified, said the Singapore firm also had transferred all
its fixed income and equity positions to other companies.
   The company, which began operations in Singapore 10 years ago,
has two branches: Drexel Burnham Lambert (S) Pte Ltd, which dealt
in government securities and commodities, and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Securities, a stockbroking arm. The two employed about 51
people.
   Drexel officials said negotiations were under way over a
possible employee buyout of the Singapore operations.
   After its Chapter 11 filing last week, Drexel began liquidating
its businesses, including the once-powerful investment firm that
rose and fell with the fortunes of junk bond financing. The
company's collapse was due in part to heavy losses on the junk bond
market.
   Most of Drexel's multibillion-dollar U.S. Treasury securities
portfolio was sold by Thursday, Drexel officials said. Drexel's
junk bond holdings, estimated at $1 billion, were being sold at
prices below market value.
   Employees were terminated Friday at the company's headquarters
in New York and its junk bond department in Beverly Hills, Calif.,
and given small severance packages.
   A small, unspecified number of Drexel workers also were kept on
to help wind down operations.
   Job prospects for most of the U.S. workers are dim. Wall Street
has been in a slump since the October 1987 market crash, and many
firms have contracted by eliminating entire divisions and laying
off thousands of workers.

<HEAD>Nation of Beefeaters Destined to Consume Less, Agriculture
Secretary Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The days when an Argentine family
could feast on filet mignon for less than what hamburger costs in
most other countries may be nearing an end.
   Like most everything else in an economy wracked by
hyperinflation and recession, beef has come to be priced in U.S.
dollars rather than Argentina's debased currency, the austral. For
many Argentines, beef already is out of reach.
   ``We Argentines will have to get used to meat ... as something
that is almost a luxury,'' Agriculture Secretary Felipe Sola said
Monday.
   For more than a century, beef has been to Argentina what oil is
to Saudi Arabia: a major export, a source of prosperity, a national
symbol.
   Herds were so plentiful that travelers on the pampas, the
fertile plains surrounding Buenos Aires, could shoot a cow for
dinner, sometimes eating just the tongue, according to legend,
provided they left the hide, which would be sold for leather.
   Cows still outnumber Argentina's 31 million citizens by almost
2-1, and a top steak in a good restaurant can be had for $2.50, or
about what a 2.2 pounds of filet mignon costs in a butcher shop.
   That's still cheap in international terms, but as a proportion
of salaries that have shrunk to $50 to $250 a month, it is
increasingly expensive.
   Beef consumption has fallen as inflation rocketed to 8,164
percent during the past 12 months. Nevertheless, Argentina will
consume more beef and veal this year than any other nation _ 139
pounds per person, according to projections by the U.S. Agriculture
Department's foreign agricultural service.
   But already, lifestyle changes are apparent.
   This nation that loves to dine out does so less and less. Guests
at weekend barbecues often bring their own meat to throw on the
grill. Beef has been replaced by noodles and rice on the shopping
lists of Argentines suffering wage shrinkage or outright
unemployment, which stands at about 10 percent.
   So far, the government has refused to intervene in the meat
market, where prices rose 45 percent from Friday to Monday, or
slightly more than the austral, which traded Monday at 4,200 to the
dollar.
   The austral rate a year ago was 17-1.
   The jump in the cost of living this month is projected to be
what it was in January: 79 percent. Workers might expect pay raises
in that neighborhood, but meat almost certainly will have climbed
faster, propelled by ranchers who would rather sell abroad than at
home.
