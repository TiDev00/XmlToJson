<HEAD>Four State Legislators Switch From Democratic to Republican Party</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASCAGOULA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Democratic state legislators
announced Monday that they were switching to the Republican Party,
earning them praise from President Bush.
   State Reps. Frank Ely, Alvin Endt, Danny Guice and Curtis
Holston Jr. told reporters they had considered the change for about
a year.
   ``I'm not leaving the Democrats _ they left me long ago,'' Endt
said.
   ``My thoughts are conservative and being associated with the
Republican Party is being associated with the more conservative
political party,'' he said.
   The four were accompanied at news conferences in Pascagoula and
Jackson by Ron Farris of the state GOP. Farris read a letter from
Bush, who lauded the lawmakers for their ``tremendous courage'' in
switching allegiances.
   Ely said he feels more like a Republican than a Democrat.
   ``My philosophy is more along the lines of the Republican Party.
I feel that the Democrats left me,'' he said.
   The four are up for re-election in November 1991 and said they
decided to go public with their switch in plenty of time for
constituents to make up their minds.
   Since November 1988, more than 65 elected Democrats in
Mississippi have switched to the GOP.
   Ely, who was elected to the Legislature in 1984, said many of
his constituents had called to tell him they were happy about his
decision to switch. ``I haven't had the first negative response,''
he said.
   Guice said he decided to become a Republican because he felt
state and national Democratic leaders are too liberal.
   ``I realized that I've been supporting Republicans for some time
now,'' said Guice, who was elected to the Mississippi House in 1983.
   Guice said the GOP did not court the four.
   Holston, who was elected in 1983, said he identifies more with
the Republican Party. He said he doesn't expect resistance from the
people who voted him into office.
   ``I think the majority will be pleased to see that I'm joining
the Republican Party,'' Holston said. ``The feeling of my area has
changed toward Republicans since I was originally elected as a
Democrat.''

<TEXT>
   Anderson County Sheriff Gene Taylor was
only looking to catch drug dealers when he erected billboards
promising to pay informants. Instead he's caught flak from his
critics and a $40 million lawsuit.
   Billboards around the county which read, ``Need Cash? Turn in a
drug dealer,'' wrongly lure ordinary citizens into dangerous
undercover law enforcement, say detractors of the Anderson County
sheriff.
   Under Taylor's two-month-old ``Operation Roll Over,'' drug
buyers or confidential informants are paid as much as 25 percent of
the assets seized from any dealer they help arrest. Those who
testify in court are paid more.
   ``This isn't for the little old lady down the street
necessarily,'' said Taylor, a former television reporter elected in
January 1989.
   Anderson County, population 150,000, is on Lake Hartwell in
northwestern South Carolina; its textile, high-tech and
automobile-related industries have attracted people to the area.
   Investigators have received about 10 calls a day since the first
billboard was erected in February. Most callers offer information
but refuse to testify in court, said Capt. John Skipper of the
sheriff's investigative unit.
   The number of drug-related arrests _ five to 10 a week _ has not
increased much since the program began, but it is too soon to
measure the program's success, said Chief Deputy Mike Temple.
   Deputies have seized several vehicles and several thousand
dollars from suspected dealers since the billboards were erected,
Temple said.
   He declined to release arrest figures until the program ends,
but wouldn't say when that will be. ``We'll stop the program when
it looks like those that are interested are played out,'' Temple
said.
   The billboard program was patterned after one used by the U.S.
Customs Service. ``All we did was make it a little more widely
known that it can be done,'' Taylor said.
   The drug dealers seem to be noticing, the sheriff says. ``The
word is filtering back to us now from the street that people are a
little more cautious selling,'' Taylor said.
   But all is not well with the billboard program.
   An informant, Robin M. Pickens, filed a $40 million lawsuit last
month alleging she received a fraction of the money promised her.
She also charged that the sheriff failed to pay on the mortgage on
her house as promised.
   Taylor said Ms. Pickens, whose testimony led to the conviction
of a cocaine trafficker, was paid $3,000. He denied promising to
make her house payments.
   Ms. Pickens' attorney, James B. King, said he could not discuss
the pending case. But he said ``Operation Roll Over'' exemplifies
Taylor's ``lack of experience ... in law enforcement.''
   King also said Taylor was not using informants ``properly within
the law.''
   ``Informants are one thing, but actually going out there and
inducing people and recruiting them with the allure of cash,'' is
another, he said. ``He seems to have an apparent lack of concern
for basic constitutional rights.''
   Taylor raised eyebrows in May 1989 when he announced plans to
erect narcotics checkpoints. Civil libertarians said the
checkpoints violated constitutional protection against unreasonable
searches.
   Taylor said he wasn't certain about constitutional implications,
but state Attorney General Travis Medlock said in October that
authorities could use ``any recognized weapon which is effective in
the war against drugs.''
   Taylor said the first checkpoints netted a half-dozen arrests,
and more checkpoints are planned.
   He also has been criticized for inviting reporters to watch the
arrest of 10 people in February 1989 on charges of selling
counterfeit cassette tapes at a flea market. Eventually all charges
were dropped.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Soviet Jews, the last group
to pass through this gateway to America, celebrated a Passover
dinner together in an atmosphere of joy and expectancy.
   ``It's the beginning of a new life,'' said Soviet-born Rabbi
Hirsch Rabiski, who led Monday evening's traditional Seder.
   The approximately 7,800 Soviet Jews staying in the Ladispoli
area near Rome are all to be resettled in the United States or
other countries by late May.
   Their departure marks the end of an era in which nearly all
Soviet Jews bound for the United States lived in this seaside area,
their applications handled at the main U.S. processing center in
Rome. Over time, Ladispoli became a symbol of the hope and despair
of Soviet Jewish refugees.
   Now, the U.S. government is handling the refugees' applications
in Moscow instead of Rome.
   Most of the arrivals in Ladispoli learned little about their
faith and culture in the officially atheist Soviet Union, even
though they were often persecuted for being Jews. Monday evening's
ceremony in a blue-and-white tent was the first Seder for many.
   Samuel Dropkin, 39, was determined to get it right.
   The electrical engineer carefully studied a manual in Hebrew and
Russian illustrating how to prepare for the Passover meal.
   Aided by his 7-year-old daughter, Jane (``I'm not Jana any
more''), he stacked three matzo on the table, covered them with a
paper napkin and added a hard-boiled egg, some lettuce, a slice of
onion and a dab of horseradish.
   ``I really feel as a Jew,'' he beamed.
   During the Passover meal, held on the first evening of the
holiday, Jews eat foods symbolizing themes of redemption and
freedom and read from the Hagada of the Jews' flight from Egypt.
The holiday, commemorating that exodus, is among the most important
for Jews.
   Dropkin, from the city of Baku in Azerbaijan, waved a hand at
the approximately 600 people sitting at tables piled with Passover
foods.
   ``This picture, in the Soviet Union, is impossible,'' he said in
broken English. ``This is a pleasure for us _ we join with our
people.''
   On a stage in front of the tables, Rabbi Rabiski patiently
explained the meaning of the ceremony and led prayers in Russian.
Following his example, hundreds of people stood and filled plastic
cups with sweet Lambrusco wine, the first of four glasses to be
drunk during the Passover ceremony.
   ``This is very difficult for us, it's the first time,'' said
Vitaly Shlimack, 20, of Baku, at a table with his parents and the
Dropkins.
   ``I know the (Jewish) history but very, very bad. I know the
tradition, but very, very bad.
   ``Only the words in our passports made us Jews. We had no
culture, no language, no tradition _ nothing.''
   While they are in Ladispoli, the Soviets receive religious
instruction from Jewish groups, in addition to help with housing,
money and language lessons.
   Two U.S.-based Jewish groups _ the American Joint Distribution
Committee and the Lubavitch organization _ sponsored Monday's Seder
in the tent.
   Several other, smaller Seders were held in Ladispoli and nearby
towns, with 10 rabbis flying in from the United States to help out.
   Most of the Soviet Jews have received their visas and are
awaiting transportation arrangements, medical clearance or
confirmation that they had been matched with sponsors.
   The refugees at the Ladispoli tent spoke nervously about their
new homes and the state of their English. But they were thrilled
about being able to freely practice their faith.
   ``I am going to learn every Jewish holiday, here or in
America,'' said Felix Kopylenko, 30, of Kiev, who is headed for
Chicago on April 19. He wore his baby daughter's white knit cap
because he didn't own a yarmulka, or Jewish skullcap.
   The Passover ceremony appeared to remind some of the Soviet Jews
of their own flight from their homeland.
   Dropkin said he had been denied work and educational
opportunities in the Soviet Union because he was a Jew, and ``I had
enough.''
   ``Now it's very well,'' he said, brightening. ``Now it's a
celebration.''

<HEAD>UNITA Makes Concessions as Angolan Peace Process Gathers Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As moves gather pace to restart the
Angolan peace process, Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed UNITA rebels are
tempting Angola's Marxist government with some concessions.
   The rebels are offering an immediate cease-fire and conditional
recognition of the Angolan state.
   The concessions, announced in a statement released in Lisbon on
Monday and signed by Savimbi and other top-ranking rebel officials,
have plenty of strings attached. But they could overcome an impasse
that has thwarted peace efforts since a shaky first truce collapsed
last summer.
   They are being offered after three months of what is said to be
the heaviest fighting in the war so far and stepped-up UNITA bomb
attacks in the capital, Luanda.
   According to the statement, the rebels are ``ready to cease
hostilities immediately and without preconditions,'' and would
recognize the Angolan state on the basis of accords signed before
independence from Portugal in 1975.
   There was no immediate reaction from Angolan government
officials.
   But while offering an immediate cease-fire in the field, the
statement said UNITA was ``determined to act with more aggression
in Luanda'' until a truce is sealed.
   ``If there is no peace, we'll hit where it hurts most,'' the
statement said.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)
previously conditioned talks on a government troop withdrawal from
positions captured in rebel heartlands in southeast Angola. UNITA
also always had refused even to mention the possibility of
recognition under any circumstances.
   The Alvor Accords signed in January 1975 by UNITA, the Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government and a third
guerrilla movement, the FNLA, set Angolan independence for November
of that year after an interim, power-sharing government had been
formed by the three parties.
   But fighting broke out shortly afterward, and intervention by
the United States, the Soviet Union, Cuba and South Africa
escalated the conflict to its present heights. UNITA receives a
reported $50 million or more in U.S. aid annually and Western
estimates of Soviet backing to Luanda run much higher.
   By agreeing to recognize the Angolan state, albeit under the
Alvor terms that don't guarantee MPLA authority, UNITA is aiming to
persuade Luanda moderates they can reopen talks without losing face.
   As an extra sweetener, the rebels also pledged to ``respect all
accords signed over the past 15 years by the MPLA government,''
once free and fair elections were held in Angola.
   Government hard-liners, cheered by recent military successes,
are still insisting on full recognition of the MPLA's single-party
authority and state institutions.
   Luanda's rapid military advance in late December led to the
capture of the strategic Mavinga air base in the southeast. But the
offense has been halted mainly due to faltering food, fuel and
ammunition supplies.
   Also, the rebels have made good promises to step up hit-and- run
bush war and urban guerrilla attacks, lending weight to moderates'
arguments that the conflict can only be ended by talks.
   Both sides are now proposing direct talks. Western diplomats in
Lisbon and Luanda say the government prefers Cape Verde as a venue,
but the rebels proposed direct closed-door contacts in Lisbon,
stressing that Portugal can play a ``pivotal role among Angolans of
all political sensibilities.''
   The center-right Portuguese government has kept close relations
with Luanda, while allowing UNITA to maintain a major
representation office in Lisbon that the rebels have recently
upgraded.
   But UNITA Foreign Affairs Secretary Toni da Costa Fernandes
reaffirmed in an interview on Portuguese RTP state television late
Monday that the rebels would still back President Mobutu Sese Seko
of Zaire as mediator until a truce is agreed.
   The rebel statement also suggested the superpowers play a more
active role in finding a speedy solution.

<TEXT>
   In this little desert town, where the
Greyhound depot consists of two worn chairs at the corner gas
station, it's a welcome sight when the bus rolls in from points
beyond the sagebrush horizon.
   Burns, however, hasn't seen a bus since March 2, when 9,000
Greyhound drivers, maintenance workers and others went on strike.
On Monday, Greyhound filed a $30 million lawsuit accusing strikers
of using violence to disrupt bus travel.
   While Greyhound has hired new drivers to restore service between
the nation's major cities, it has delayed resuming less profitable
runs to hundreds of remote spots like Burns _ and some say the
company may use the strike to abandon such routes permanently.
   The loss makes this isolated town seem even more isolated.
   With 2,765 residents, Burns is the largest town in southeastern
Oregon's lonely high desert. No trains run here, and the closest
airport with scheduled flights is in Bend, a two-hour drive to the
west.
   ``When the bus stops running, you don't go to somebody else,''
said Carol Graves, local Greyhound depot agent. ``There's nobody
else to go to.''
   Bus service here is not mass transit. It's eight or nine people
a day, and their faces are familiar to Leroy Wion, the gas-station
mechanic who doubles as ticket-seller and package-loader.
   ``Let's see now,'' Wion said, wiping grease from his hands as he
listed the regular passengers. ``There's old Walt _ what's his last
name? _ Watkins, that's it. And several college kids go back and
forth. And the lady who walks down the middle of the road.''
   That would be Margaret Wilson, 75, whose daily strolls in nylons
and blaze-red shorts make her something of a Burns institution.
   ``I love to ride the bus,'' she said, stopping to talk in the
middle of Broadway. ``I've ridden it for years. I don't have any
other way of getting around.''
   She takes the bus four times a year to visit her son in Emmett,
Idaho, and twice a year to see her brother in Bend. ``I don't know
why they want to go on strike, anyway,'' she said. ``The bus has
been coming through here for years.''
   Greyhound also carried the commerce of a small Western town:
frozen bull semen from the ranches, blood from the hospital,
carnations for the florists and carburetors for the auto-parts
store.
   Graves and her husband, Brian, have kept a few freight customers
by hauling packages once a week in their own truck to the bus
terminal in Bend, but business is way down.
   At 36, Graves recalls a childhood when six buses arrived daily
at the fancy bus depot downtown. But ridership declined in the
1960s, and two bus runs were eliminated. Then the depot burned
down. Three years ago, Greyhound bought out Pacific Trailways and
halted two of the four remaining runs.
   Union representatives say they fear the strike will give
Greyhound executives an excuse to accelerate the gradual erosion of
bus service to Burns and other rural points.
   ``Until they are in a very good financial operating condition
again, if they ever reach that stage, I don't see them going into
the out-of-the-way places again,'' said Nicholas Moore, spokesman
for the Portland-based Local 1384 of the striking Amalgamated
Transit Union. ``It could be months, it could be never.''
   Company officials say service will reach 60 percent of
pre-strike levels by Easter, but concede their focus is on the big
cities. Many of the 9,000 towns where Greyhound provides the only
intercity transportation are still waiting.
   ``It's not our intent to abandon anyone,'' said Greyhound
spokesman George Graveley in Dallas. But he offered no promises:
``We're not quite ready to commit ourselves to the long term on
what we're going to do.''
   Back at the gas station, Leroy Wion was hoping Greyhound would
make up its mind soon.
   ``Greyhound bus depot,'' he said, answering the phone. ``No
ma'am, the strike's still on.''
   The receiver buzzed with the irate caller's reply, and Wion hung
up silently. He shook his head and told a visitor, ``You don't even
want to know what she said.''

<DATELINE>SANOK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poland's fast shift to a market economy has
shocked the 6,300 workers and managers of the Autosan Bus Factory,
long wrapped in the warm cocoon of central planning.
   With unsold buses gathering dust on the factory's parking lot,
most of the plant is on ``work holiday'' and at least several
hundred people are to be laid off permanently.
   It is an example of how for the first time in decades in this
formerly Communist country, economic failure packs a painful punch.
   To make things harder for Sanok, a remote community on the edge
of the Carpathian Mountains in the southeast corner of Poland,
there are already 1,500 registered job-seekers and no employers
large enough to absorb them. In housing-short Poland, relocating is
seldom an option.
   ``Sanok will become a city of the unemployed,'' said metalworker
Stanislaw Potoczny ruefully.
   ``People are depressed by the situation, really depressed,''
said Jan Solar, foreman in charge of the tooling department.
``Everyone is wondering, `If I am fired, who will employ me?'''
   Company Director Jan Wilk, looking glum during a recent
interview, complained that he had no time to adjust to the free
economic system introduced Jan. 1 by the Solidarity-led government.
And the tight-money policies imposed to quench raging inflation
have dried up demand, especially for big-ticket items like his
$30,000 to $60,000 buses.
   ``Poland has a market economy, but it has no market,'' Wilk said.
   Across Poland, state-owned enterprises like Autosan, which
formerly paid only fleeting attention to the balance sheet,
suddenly face the profit-or-perish pressure that managers in the
West have long known.
   The government used to be the financier of last resort, printing
money to cover the losses of state-owned enterprises. Businesses
were judged by how they fulfilled their plan, not by how much money
they made or whether they produced anything anyone wanted to buy.
   But no more.
   Traditional crutches for East bloc managers _ easy credit from
the state, government subsidies, cheap access to hard currency,
guaranteed customers and lack of competition _ no longer function
under the government's far-reaching reforms.
   Having raised prices all they dare and gone through financial
reserves, many companies are now desperately cutting costs to avoid
bankruptcy. That includes labor costs in a country where job
security was considered a birthright through four decades of
communism.
   The government has budgeted unemployment benefits for 400,000
people this year but does not dispute a World Bank projection of up
to 1.7 million jobless in a work force of 18 million.
   On the Autosan plant floor, the threat of layoffs has brought
about a new respect for jobs among employees, said foreman Solar.
   ``An atmosphere of good work has come back because they are
afraid of being fired. Before, if I asked people to do something,
they might not do it. Now, everyone does.
   ``It is one of the points of the reform that is positive.''
   Wilk said government policy had mandated that Autosan produce
for the domestic bus market and for the Soviet Union at prices that
were not profitable. Now, he is scrambling to find new markets in
Europe and Africa and hoping for a Western company to subcontract
work or form a joint venture.
   An ``offer for cooperation'' was sent out blindly to Western
companies and even to embassies, listing assets and a dozen ideas
that might interest foreign partners, ranging from making a
complete bus to leasing factory space.
   ``The scope of our services can be expanded to customer's needs
and trend of business. All your suggestions will be welcomed. SO .
.. GET YOUR CHANCE,'' the English-language brochure says hopefully.
   But Wilk has no illusion that a Western partner will solve his
short-term problem, 240 new buses and 1,200 trailers parked at his
factory with no customers in sight. He's decided to stop production
except for special orders.
   ``If production is lower, then the number of employees must be
lower too,'' he said.
   He said he did not know how many people would be let go in all,
but criticized as exaggerated a report on the state's PAP news
agency that 1,500 workers would get their notices. For one thing,
Autosan cannot afford the legally required severance pay of three
month's salary.
   The plant slowdown started in January and February, when
two-week work furloughs were ordered. Another began in April.
   Wilk then started trimming about 400 jobs. The first to go, at
the end of April, will be 40 soccer players who did no work but
were financed from the factory payroll.
   Laid off too were 120 draft-age youths who were working at the
plant in lieu of serving in the military and about 100 workers who
had committed disciplinary infractions in the past, such as theft
or drinking. Veteran workers were offered early retirement, and the
plant canteen was axed, he said.
   The next target may be recently hired employees, those without
families, and up to 2,500 workers who on the side operate small
farms, Wilk said.
   If one would expect Solidarity union local head Henryk Kozik to
be demoralized, he quickly sets the record straight.
   ``I am an optimist,'' says the energetic Kozik, explaining that
the union has been working with the management to minimize layoffs
while striving to help the plant develop business. He has few
qualms about the new government's economic policies.
   ``We all have to root out the consequences of the system that we
had here for 40 years,'' he said. The alternative is ``to fall into
the abyss.''

   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' may be the
nation's No. 1 movie, but it ranks last with the National Coalition
on Television Violence, which says the film is the year's most
violent.
   In a survey released Monday, the Illinois-based organization
said the hit film ``glorifies violence and promotes a culture of
violence,'' citing 194 separate violent acts.
   The group advised parents and children to avoid the movie, which
follows the exploits of four crime-fighting turtles skilled in
martial arts. The coalition's report included a meticulous
blow-by-blow account of all the alleged violence contained in the
film.
   ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' rated PG, has made more than
$50 million at the box office so far, as has been the nation's most
popular film for two weeks in a row.
   Repeated telephone messages seeking comment was left on the
answering machine of New Line Cinema, the film's distributor. The
calls went unreturned.

   A 71-year-old retired construction

   ``They wiped me out,'' said Roy Rogers, the warren's owner.
   Someone broke and snatched up dozens of bunnies that would have

heart condition and I can't let it bother me. My heart is fine but
my stomach is sick. ...''
   Cages which serve as home for mother rabbits and their broods
are located behind a chain-link fence only a few feet behind the
Rogers' home.
   ``We didn't hear a thing,'' said Rogers.
   Police told Rogers they expect the thieves to attempt to market
the stolen merchandise through pets stores or by roadside sales.

<HEAD>Poindexter May Avoid Jail on Iran-Contra Convictions, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fact that no one has spent a day in jail
in the Iran-Contra scandal will work heavily in John Poindexter's
favor on sentencing day, legal observers say.
   ``I'm a great believer in the judge taking his cue from the jury
and in this case, the jury brought in the most severe sentence'' by
convicting Poindexter on all counts, said Paul Rothstein, a
Georgetown University law professor.
   But the fact that Oliver North didn't get any prison time
``militates a little bit against prison time for Poindexter,'' said
Rothstein, a past chairman of the American Bar Association's
criminal procedure committee.
   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane and North both
were placed on two years' probation in the affair. McFarlane
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors in the scandal and a jury
convicted North last year of three felonies.
   Poindexter was convicted Saturday of five felonies _ conspiracy,
two counts of lying to Congress and two counts of obstruction _ in
connection with the covert sale of arms to Iran and the diversion
of profits to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``It's not clear to me that Poindexter was any more culpable
than the other Iran-Contra defendants ... North and McFarlane,''
said John Nields, former chief counsel to the House Iran-Contra
investigating committee.
   Nields said that assessment of culpability raises questions in
his mind as to ``what an appropriate sentence for Poindexter ought
to be.''
   Poindexter could face up to 25 years in prison and $1.25 million
in fines. He is to be sentenced June 11 by U.S. District Judge
Harold Greene. McFarlane was fined $20,000; North was ordered to
pay a $150,000 fine and serve a period of community service with an
anti-drug organization.
   Rothstein said Poindexter was further up in the hierarchy than
North and ``correspondingly more guilty'' in the Iran-Contra affair.
   A former federal prosecutor agreed, saying Poindexter was at a
disadvantage, compared with North, in terms of pointing the finger
of responsibility at others.
   ``North had the insulation of Poindexter to point to'' while
Poindexter didn't have anyone but President Reagan above him, said
the former prosecutor, who is now a defense attorney in Washington
and who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A jail sentence could be viewed as a deterrent, said a second
former prosecutor, now also a defense attorney in Washington.
   ``The issue becomes, does Harold Greene want to sentence John
Poindexter for any of this as a symbol,'' since in all likelihood
there will be no further prosecution of Reagan administration
higher-ups, said a third former federal prosecutor now practicing
law in New York. He also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Rothstein predicted that Greene ``would be sensitive to an
employee who was put in this bad position by his boss,'' the
president. The judge ``will sympathize to some extent with
Poindexter's'' predicament, he said.
   Poindexter's lawyers portrayed him at his trial as a loyal,
hard-working bureaucrat who tried his best to carry out Reagan's
policies, a view reflected by conservatives.
   ``It was a shame a patriot like Admiral Poindexter should have
to face possible incarceration,'' Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said in
a statement.
   After pleading guilty in the Iran-Contra affair, businessmen
Richard Secord and Albert Hakim and fundraisers Carl ``Spitz''
Channell and Richard Miller all were placed on two years' probation.

   Lois and Donald Muller thought they had
a friend in Michael Anthony. But when police found their flatware
in his cabinets and their sheets in his linen closet, the Mullers
realized they were wrong.
   They came home one day last month to find it stripped of most of
its valuables, including televisions, jewelry, even the washer and
dryer. They placed the value at $50,000. Many items, including the
car, silver and washer and dryer, remain missing.
   Mrs. Muller visited antique shops and second-hand stores, hoping
to find some of the missing items. She finally came upon a shop
where she saw a silver salt shaker with a small dent and mended
base, similar to the one she had repaired. Then she saw her
father-in-law's old cigarette case.
   ``Then I knew for sure,'' she said Monday, and she called the
police.
   Authorities spoke to the shop's owner, Joseph Trovato, who
described the person who sold him the items. The description
matched that of family friend Anthony, she said.
   She accompanied police to Anthony's home last week, and police
said they found many of the missing items. They arrested and
charged him with receiving stolen property. He was released on
$5,000 personal recognizance bail.
   Mrs. Muller said she and her husband met Anthony through a
mutual interest in horse breeding. She said they liked him, invited
him to dinner many times and even tried to help him arrange
financing last year to save his horse-breeding farm. But he went
bankrupt and the farm was auctioned.

<HEAD>Actor Todd Bridges Faces Bail Increase for No-Show at Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' co-star Todd
Bridges missed a court date in his assault case, and a court
commissioner said she will consider raising the actor's $25,000
bail.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Florence Marie Cooper
said Monday that she was dissatisfied with the 24-year-old actor's
excuse for failing to appear at Friday's session.
   Bridges, who faces an assault charge in the shooting of a
cocaine dealer, said he missed the hearing because his car was
sideswiped in a hit-and-run accident on the Ventura Freeway.
   He said he never filed a police report because police ``make me
very nervous.''
   Bridges' attorney, Johnnie Cochran Jr., said it was the first
time the actor had ever been late or missed a court appearance.
   The commissioner set an April 20 hearing on whether to raise
bail.
   Bridges is being retried on a charge stemming from last year's
shooting of Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay. Prosecutors said Bridges shot
Clay eight times at a reputed south-central Los Angeles crack house
during a dispute over the actor's BMW.
   Jurors acquitted Bridges of attempted murder and involuntary
manslaughter, but they remained deadlocked on the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon.
   Friday's hearing had been set to determine the date of Bridge's
trial on the assault charge.

<HEAD>Alaskan Wants to Turn Gary, Ind., Into a National Forest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Picture the nation's greatest natural
treasures _ the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone National Park, Olympic
National Forest, Gary, Ind. ...
   Gary, Ind.?
   An Alaska congressman who resents an Indiana colleague's
involvement in debate over the Pacific Northwest's timber supply
wants to ``recreate the ancient forests'' over 1.3 million acres of
northwest Indiana.
   The tongue-in-cheek plan to establish a new national forest in
Indiana was circulated among lawmakers in response to Rep. Jim
Jontz's call to protect old-growth forests in California, Oregon
and Washington.
   ``This is a novel approach in that it would seek to recreate
ancient forests of the region which have been decimated by
industrial agriculture,'' Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, said in a
letter explaining his idea.
   ``Today, instead of virgin forests and unbroken sod, this area
is heavily industrialized, either in manufacturing or agriculture.
If you think the folks in Chicago and Indianapolis deserve a
national forest for their recreation, please join me in this
effort,'' he wrote.
   Last week, Jontz, D-Ind., drew criticism from Oregon and
Washington lawmakers, who said his proposal to set up a new
preserve of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest would cost
the region's timber industry billions of dollars and thousands of
jobs.
   ``Maybe we should take all the warehouses in Muncie (Ind.) and
declare them to be ancient historic treasures,'' said Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.
   Jontz indicated Monday he would not take Young's proposal
seriously. ``We all like Don. He's really a funny guy,'' Jontz said
in a statement.
   Young was in Alaska on Monday and could not be reached for
further comment. His aides in Washington and Anchorage did not
return telephone messages.
   Young said in the letter that under hios proposal, Congress
would order the U.S. Forest Service to acquire 1.3 million acres in
northwest Indiana through purchase or donation. He said it would
reduce ground water pollution caused by runoff from farm chemicals.
   ``While this (forest) might cost a bit up front, the reduced
need for federal subsidies for agricultural production over the
long haul would mean savings for the federal government. Thousands
of jobs could be created in the tourism industry,'' he said.
   Jontz's plan, backed by four leading environmental groups, would
ban logging and development on millions of acres of public forest
land.
   Forest Service Chief F. Dale Robertson said last week that a
scientific panel's recommendations to save the northern spotted owl
from extinction would affect 2.7 million acres and reduce harvests
by about 25 percent on national forests in the Pacific Northwest.
   Jontz said his proposal would affect more land because it is
involved with protecting the ecosystems of the old-growth forests,
not just the spotted owl.
   Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., said Jontz has been insensitive to the
fate of the Northwest's economy. He said that although Young's
proposal was made in jest, the overall message was serious.
   ``I think it reflects the level of frustration a lot of us in
the West feel about someone in Indiana who obviously feels it is no
skin off his nose regarding what probably will be the biggest
economic dislocation the Pacific Northwest ever will experience,''
Smith said in a telephone interview.
   ``Maybe we should have some pain and suffering developing in
Indiana so they could understand what we are going through. Maybe
that would ease the emotional pitch that some people in Indiana are
looking at this with,'' Smith said.

<HEAD>Administration Signaling Harder Line on El Salvador, Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is signaling it
intends to take a harder line toward El Salvador's government and
the leftist guerrillas who have waged a decade-long civil war,
officials say.
   The new policy is coming about through discussions with
Congress, where El Salvador remains a leading sore point in foreign
policy.
   A first round of contacts came last week between Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and congressional leaders of both parties.
Baker aides said the visits on Capitol Hill were intended to
indicate a willingness to rethink the U.S. policy of undiluted
support for the Salvadoran government.
   On one side, the issue is being propelled by mounting concern
among congressional liberals over human rights lapses in the tiny
Central American country _ and in particular the murders last year
of six Jesuit priests.
   From the administration's standpoint, a bipartisan agreement on
U.S. policy would blunt a thorny domestic political issue and
enhance chances for success at United Nations-sponsored talks in
Geneva between the Salvadoran government and the leftist rebels.
The civil war has cost an estimated 70,000 lives.
   Success in those talks is particularly important to Bernard
Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs.
Aides said he has a deep personal desire to promote peace in what
remains the most serious trouble spot in the hemisphere.
   ``My sense is there will be some restriction on aid to the
government of El Salvador, conditioned on an effective
investigation and prosecution of the Jesuit murders,'' said a
senior congressional Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   At least two serious complications threaten the discussions.
   Congressional sources said shipments of weapons to the FMLN
rebels from Nicaragua have tripled in the past month, since the
leftist Sandinista government in Managua lost in national
elections. The stepped-up shipments apparently are an effort to
build stockpiles before a new government takes over and the weapons
pipeline is shut down, the sources said.
   And there are indications that the Salvadoran government may be
unable to successfully prosecute Col. Guillermo Alfredo Benavides,
the highest-ranking officer indicted in the Jesuit slayings,
because of insufficient evidence and a weak judicial system.
   Meetings between Baker and members of Congress, reminiscent of
the process the secretary followed last year to forge a bipartisan
policy on Nicaragua, will resume after lawmakers return from their
Easter recess on April 18.
   ``This break allows time for the talks in Geneva to proceed,''
said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. ``If they make headway, it will be a
lot easier for us to get a bipartisan accord.''
   Lugar said that conversely, agreement among U.S. politicians
could enhance chances for negotiating success between the two
warring sides in El Salvador.
   ``Our statements and motions and debates here have a
disproportionate influence'' on the Salvadorans, he said. Often the
leftist FMLN rebels and the government find it easier to sit back
and hope for their partisans in Congress to win policy battles than
to negotiate themselves, Lugar added.
   While the talks in Washington are at an early stage,
participants on both sides said they seem headed toward adoption of
a new set of conditions on U.S. aid to the Salvadoran government.
The conditions could include progress toward creating an effective
legal system and weeding out suspected human rights abusers from
the military.
   The primary vehicle for discussion has been a proposal by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., to withhold half of the country's
anticipated $90 million in military aid in fiscal 1991 and use the
escrowed funds as leverage to keep the two sides negotiating and on
good behavior.
   Under Dodd's proposal, if the rebels were to mount a military
offensive or walk away from the bargaining table, the military aid
to the government would be restored; if the government were to seek
military advantage or quit the talks, aid would be cut even more
deeply.
   One administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Baker might ultimately be willing to accept some such
conditions on a small portion of next year's military aid money _
less than the 50 percent Dodd proposed, but enough to send a signal
that the United States is newly serious about peace and human
rights.
   Meanwhile Monday, the administration said it will spend $3.6
million in already appropriated funds to help the peace process in
Nicaragua as a stopgap measure because Congress went on an Easter
recess without acting on a Central America aid package.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the money will be
used to help the U.S.-backed Contra rebels disband and resettle.
The administration's $870 million aid package included about $30
million for that purpose.
   ``We are quite concerned about this,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
wanted to foster demobilization and repatriation (of the Contras)
as expeditiously as possible.''

   Cheryl St. John doesn't cast evil spells.
She'd rather bake chocolate raisin bread than stir eye of newt and
toe of frog into a bubbling cauldron. And she carries her
broomstick in the trunk of her suburban sedan.
   ``I'm a good witch, but bad witches have more fun,'' she says
with a mischievous wink.
   By day, she's a 37-year-old computer programmer who dresses for
corporate success. By night, she's Lady Cassandra, the black-clad
high priestess of three covens of metropolitan Washington D.C.
witches who worship an ancient goddess of fertility.
   She's also a shaman, ``a sort of traveling chaplain'' who visits
divorcees, drug addicts, cancer patients and other witches who need
the healing hand of a spiritual companion in their time of
suffering.
   She takes along a canvas gym bag stuffed with the tools for a
portable altar _ a goddess image, chalices, incense, candles,
broom, hand-carved wand and a beribboned sword, her badge of
witching authority.
   The broom, incidentally, is not for riding the skies under a
full moon. The bride and groom jump over it for good luck at
witches' weddings, or ``handfastings.'' Following centuries-old
tradition, Ms. St. John uses her broom to make sure the altar's
``magic circle'' is swept clean of evil thoughts.
   ``I'm everything the pastor in your local church would be,'' she
says. ``I marry 'em and I bury 'em. I specialize in healing the
heart. I let the doctors work with potions, and I work with the
soul.''
   Her followers gather regularly around a coffee table altar in
Ms. St. John's townhouse in this Washington suburb for an evening
of meditation, worship and study of the Wiccan religion, a
nature-loving pagan faith with roots in ancient Western Europe.
   Her branch of the Wiccan tradition celebrates the feminine
virtues of life-giving, nurturing and respect for the environment,
with true equality of the sexes. She traces its origins to the
pre-Christian Celtic isles.
   ``We are the snakes that St. Patrick chased out of Ireland,''
says Ms. St. John, who regards snakes as holy.
   Eight times a year, her witches join hundreds of others in
forested parks or rented hotel ballrooms to celebrate seasonal
holidays on the Wiccan calendar with festivals of dancing, singing
and storytelling. The most joyful event, naturally, is Halloween,
which marks the Wiccan new year.
   Ms. St. John, a psychic who entered the witchhood eight years
ago, estimates there are 1,000 or more witches or serious students
of witchcraft in the Washington area, and perhaps 20,000 or more
throughout the United States. Other estimates range as high as
100,000, but nobody knows for sure.
   Most witches have stayed in the broom closet, fearful of job
losses, evictions, social ostracism and the vengeful wrath of
fundamentalist preachers if they're found out.
   Ms. St. John decided to go public when she became outraged over
accusations that witches practice devil worship and black magic, or
that they boil babies to obtain the fat for making altar candles.
   ``Most of our people use magic to heal themselves and bring what
we need into our lives,'' she said. ``There are a lot of wackos out
there, but we're as ethical a bunch of people as you're ever going
to meet. Our basic law is `do as you will, but harm none.'''
   It's not all toil and trouble, however.
   She may be a good witch, but Ms. St. John occasionally uses her
magical powers for some innocent fun.
   ``I use it to get parking places,'' she said. ``When my friends
and I go out to eat, I will visualize the restaurant in my mind and
visualize a parking space close by. When we drive up, it's there.
   ``You make it happen in your mind, and it happens,'' she said.
``That's what magic is all about.''

<HEAD>North, Poindexter Could be Called Before Grand Jury, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors may call Oliver North and John
Poindexter before a federal grand jury to answer questions about
the Iran-Contra scandal, according to sources who have watched the
investigation closely.
   That would give Iran-Contra prosecutors their first opportunity
to conduct a wide-ranging iterrogation of North outside the
constraints imposed by a courtroom trial setting.
   Poindexter is a candidate for a grand jury appearance following
his sentencing June 11 on his convictions for conspiracy,
obstruction and lying to Congress, say the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Grand jury appearances by North and Poindexter probably would
constitute the final phase of the Iran-Contra criminal
investigation, the sources said. A Poindexter appearance could
include questions about former President Reagan's role in the
affair.
   North's and Poindexter's testimony, which could be compelled
under a grant of immunity from prosecution, probably would not
produce additional indictments, the sources said.
   But it could fill in missing information about the affair and
help prosecutors compile a final report on the scandal.
   That is the consensus drawn from a series of interviews with
sources in and out of government who have watched the Iran-Contra
investigation closely over the past three years. All the comments
were made on condition of anonymity and the Iran-Contra
prosecutor's office declined to comment on the matter.
   Poindexter, like North, gave immunized testimony to Congress in
1987. Poindexter testified that he didn't inform President Reagan
about the diversion of Iran arms sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels.
   But Poindexter didn't testify at his own trial and a grand jury
appearance would be Iran-Contra prosecutors' first opportunity to
question him.
   Poindexter's conspiracy conviction on Saturday was the first
courtroom confirmation that Poindexter, North, the late CIA
director William J. Casey, national security adviser Robert
McFarlane and others worked illegally together.
   The conspirators' goals, the investigators have said, were to
conceal from Congress evidence of the diversion of Iran arms sale
money to the Contras, the U.S. role in a Hawk missile shipment to
Iran and North's military support for the Nicaraguan rebels during
a time when direct or indirect U.S. aid was banned.
   Iran-Contra prosecutor Dan Webb said Saturday he was ``just a
little disappointed'' he didn't get to cross-examine Poindexter.
   Webb said he considered Poindexter's vulnerable points to
include the former national security adviser's destruction of a
Nov. 21, 1986, document signed by Reagan that approved the Hawk
missile shipment to Iran.
   Webb said he also wanted to question Poindexter about ``why he
congratulated Oliver North after he found out North lied to
Congress,'' said the prosecutor.
   North denied to the House intelligence committee that he was
giving military advice to the Contras. Poindexter subsequently sent
North a message saying, ``Well done.''
   If North is called before a grand jury, his personal notes
scribbled in spiral-bound notebooks would provide the grist for a
lengthy list of questions from prosecutors. His copious notes
pertain to daily conversations on the Iran and Contra initiatives.
   Portions of the notebooks were available to congressional
investigators after North attorney Brendan Sullivan supplied them
to Congress. North was forced to turn over all of the notebooks to
prosecutors a year ago when he testified at his own trial.
   North's notebooks for 1984 through 1986 contain thousands of
pages of daily jottings listing who he talked to, when and the
outline of the discussions. Parts of them were released publicly by
Congress, but most of them were not.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors are likely to be interested in North's:
   _Contact with Donald Gregg of then-Vice President Bush's office.
   _Meetings with the State Department's Elliott Abrams and the
CIA's Alan Fiers.
   Gregg, now the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has said he did
not know of North's involvement with the Contra resupply operation
until Aug. 8, 1986. Gregg, then Bush's national security affairs
adviser, said he didn't tell the vice president of North's role
until December 1986.
   Abrams, Fiers and North met frequently during a congressional
ban on military aid to the Contras which required the CIA to
withdraw from its role of supplying the rebel force.

<HEAD>Former Polish Leader Breaks 10-Year Silence to Plug Book</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward Gierek, who was toppled as Poland's
Communist leader in 1980 after Solidarity's birth, has broken a
10-year silence on state television to push a book on his decade of
rule.
   Gierek, 77, told viewers on Sunday that his silence ``had not
been my fault'' and thanked people whom he did not name for helping
to publish ``The Aborted Decade.'' The book, due out this month, is
based on interviews of Gierek by journalist Janusz Rolicki.
   Gierek's trademark crew-cut has grayed and he spoke standing in
his one-minute remarks, wearing a blue sweater and glasses.
   Gierek came to power as head of Poland's Communist Party in
1970, succeeding Wladyslaw Gomulka, who was forced out after
security forces fired on workers in the Baltic ports of Gdansk and
Gdynia, killing scores.
   A one-time coal miner in France and Belgium, Gierek boosted
Poland's international reputation while improving Poles' standard
of living by borrowing heavily from abroad.
   But that borrowing led to a multibillion-dollar foreign debt and
then Solidarity, the East bloc's first independent labor
federation, was born in a workers' revolt.
   Gierek's former party comrades blamed him for the workers'
grievances and the foreign debt and he was forced to retire to his
home city of Katowice, where he has led a reclusive existence.
   Over the years, Gierek routinely refused requests for interviews.
   Now, the union he agreed to legalize in 1980 has created the
East bloc's first non-Communist government and the party he once
led has officially been dissolved.
   Of his upcoming book, Gierek said, ``I leave the judgment of the
contents to the readers ... They will judge those years, the 70s,
in the best, most just way.''

   Open pits of oily waste dotting the arid
landscape of west Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma are instant
deathtraps for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds each year,
say federal officials who are cracking down on the pit owners.
   ``Once their wings touch that oil, they crash. ... Once they
land they're done. They start preening their feathers, and that oil
gets into their digestive system; it's really a pathetic death,''
said Tom Smylie, assistant regional director of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Southwest region.
   Robert Lee, a special agent with the wildlife service in
Lubbock, Texas, said half a million protected, non-game birds are
killed in the pits every year in Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico,
along with another 100,000 waterfowl.
   ``That's twice the number of birds estimated killed by the Exxon
Valdez oil spill, and that's annually,'' Lee said.
   Lee and Smylie complained that state regulators in Texas and
Oklahoma have failed to vigorously pursue the problem. New Mexico
requires screens on open pits, and Smylie said 90 percent of the
state's 5,649 known pits have been covered.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service, after investigating the problem,
in late 1988 gave oil and gas companies and other industries that
use the pits a one-year grace period to cover them or clean them up.
   Since Oct. 3, 1989, operators of pits have been subject to
criminal fines under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which makes it
illegal ``at any time, by any means, or in any manner, to ... kill
... any migratory birds.''
   In the first case since then, Union Pacific Railroad of Houston
pleaded guilty before a U.S. magistrate in Lubbock to killing 46
migratory birds in a waste treatment pond in Big Spring.
   The company is to pay a $5,000 criminal penalty and $1,393.50 in
civil restitution to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for
the lost birds. It also must cover the pond with a screen mesh to
prevent further wildlife deaths, the Wildlife Service said.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of the Northern District of Texas
said he wanted the case to ``serve as a warning to those in the oil
industry who have neglected to clean up their oil pits. If they
have oil pits that are killing migratory birds, this office will
actively pursue their prosecution.''
   Lee said he is working on additional cases against 29 companies
with pits or tanks in his region of west Texas.
   Lee said he believes there are thousands of pits and tanks
covered with an oily film in his region of Texas alone, and ``I
have reason to believe there are at least as many pits per area of
oil production in other parts of Texas.
   ``Most of the pits I'm dealing with contain at least a skim of
oil; some are full of oil. Some of them are legal and permitted by
the state of Texas; many of them are in violation of state law,''
Lee said.
   Lee called the illegal pits a ``deathtrap'' for birds and other
wildlife, including porcupines, opossums, white-tailed deer,
coyotes, rabbits and reptiles.
   But Texas Railroad Commission spokesman Brian Schaible said the
state already prohibits the storage of oil in such pits.
   ``We have rules in place that make storing of oil in those pits
illegal,'' Schaible said Friday. ``It seems kind of
counterproductive to have a rule that you have to have a net over
this pit that has illegal oil in it. The bottom line is that we've
got the rules, we're enforcing the rules.''
   Schaible said testimony from the oil industry in Texas ``is that
they don't have problems with birds.''

   Gov. Gaston Caperton, whose 23-year
marriage ended in a messy divorce last fall, has gone public with
his new relationship with a symphony conductor. His former wife,
meanwhile, is running for state treasurer.
   Former beauty queen Dee Caperton says she can work cooperatively
with the governor, and she dismisses speculation she may run
against him in 1992 with millions of dollars received in their
divorce settlement.
   She faces two other Democrats in a primary May 8.
   As treasurer, Ms. Caperton and the governor would have to work
closely on several boards, including one that oversees most state
finances.
   Their relationship clearly is strained, however. Caperton has
abruptly left political events when his ex-wife arrives.
   Caperton, 50, recently made public his relationship with Rachael
Worby, 40, conductor of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra and also
recently divorced.
   ``Rather than having people constantly speculating, we tried to
be as upfront as possible,'' gubernatorial spokesman G.C. Morse
said. ``It was done for an interested public, not a public
interest.''
   But as Caperton's old and new female companions hold the
public's eye, the governor's popularity has plummeted to the lowest
level since his landslide election in 1988.
   Only 14 percent of state residents said he was doing a good or
excellent job during West Virginia's first statewide teachers'
strike last month, according to a statewide poll taken for several
news organizations.
   Caperton, a political newcomer who built up his family's small
insurance company, defeated Arch Moore on a pledge of integrity and
a ``break with the politics of the past.''
   It was his former wife, a tall, blonde runner-up in the 1964
Miss America Pageant, who blazed the family's political trail by
winning a House of Delegates seat in 1986. She gave up her seat in
1988 to help her husband run for governor.
   But five months after his January 1989 inaugural address,
Caperton acknowledged his wife had moved out of the governor's
mansion and they would divorce.
   Ms. Caperton, 47, sued for divorce in county court in July. She
then went to federal court in August charging the governor and an
associate defrauded her of $12 million from sale of stock in the
family business.
   They were divorced Oct. 24 as the federal suit was settled
privately for $11 million, according to many local media reports
that neither side would confirm. Ms. Caperton said her husband was
worth $30 million.
   In an interview, Ms. Caperton said the effects of the divorce
have been ``a wash.''
   ``For the person it disturbs, there is another person affected
positively by it,'' she said.
   She also denied speculation in West Virginia media and The
Washington Post that she is interested in the governorship.
   ``No, no. I intend to run for treasurer again in 1992,'' she
said.
   The governor, who declined to be interviewed, has said he has
not tried to scuttle his ex-wife's candidacy.
   For her part, Ms. Caperton has shown no animosity toward the new
first couple.
   ``I have met Rachael and she is a very accomplished person,''
Ms. Caperton said, ``and I wish her well.''
   Worby, who studied musicology at Brandeis University, became the
Wheeling Symphony's conductor in 1986 and is credited with
dramatically increasing the symphony's ticket sales and budget. She
also serves as music director of Carnegie Hall Young People's
Concert.
   Morse said Worby is not a political person and the tough world
of politics is unknown to her.
   ``What upsets (Caperton) is any potential toll on her,'' Morse
said. ``I think it's hard for him. ... As much as he cares for her,
and I think he does, he didn't want attention spilling over and
hurting her.''

   A rock-and-roll version of Shakespeare's ``The
Tempest'' and a drama about four south London clergymen were named
the British theater season's best musical and play at the Laurence
Olivier Awards.
   In a ceremony late Sunday, Bob Carlton's ``Return To the
Forbidden Planet'' unexpectedly beat out the favorite, ``Miss
Saigon,'' in the musical category.
   But ``Miss Saigon,'' a lavish Broadway-bound musical about the
Vietnam War, won awards for outstanding musical actor _ Jonathan
Pryce _ and musical actress _ Lea Salonga.
   David Hare's ``Racing Demon'' was named best play and also took
best actor prize for Oliver Ford Davies, who plays Lionel Espy.
Observers had expected the prize would go to Ian McKellen for his
roles in both ``Othello'' and ``Bent.''
   The annual awards, named for he late actor Lord Olivier, were
announced in a nationally televised ceremony at the Dominion
Theater. They are London's equivalent to Broadway's Tony Awards but
don't carry the same commercial clout. Irish performer Fiona Shaw
was named actress of the year for performances in three productions
_ ``As You Like It,'' ``Electra,'' and ``The Good Person of
Sichuan.''
   Michael Bryant was named outstanding supporting performer, male
or female, for his work in ``Racing Demon,'' ``The Voysey
Inheritance,'' and ``Hamlet.'' In his acceptance speech, Bryant
paid tribute to his ``Hamlet'' co-star, the late Ian Charleson,
whom he called a ``gallant gentleman.'' Charleson died of AIDS in
January.
   The year's best director, Michael Bogdanov for ``The Wars of the
Roses,'' won over stiff competition from Trevor Nunn _ ``Othello''
_ and Nicholas Hytner _ ``Miss Saigon.''
   Jeremy Northam, the 28-year-old lead in last summer's revival of
``The Voysey Inheritance,'' was chosen most promising newcomer for
playing the morally upright Edward Voysey in Harley Granville
Barker's 1905 play.
   The year's best designer was Ireland's Bob Crowley for four
productions: ``Ghetto,'' ``Hedda Gabler,'' ``Ma Rainey's Black
Bottom,'' and ``The Plantagenets.''
   The opera and dance awards went to Germany's Komische Oper for
``Orpheus and Eurydice'' and the London Contemporary Dance
Theater's ``Orfeo,'' respectively.
   Alan Bennett's ``Single Spies,'' two one-act plays starring
Bennett and Prunella Scales, was chosen best comedy. Michael Gambon
was named best comedy actor for his role as a suburban bank clerk
in Alan Ayckbourn's ``Man of the Moment.''

<HEAD>US Military Could Return to Vietnam Base, Congressman Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House committee hope to get
permission this week to inspect Cam Ranh Bay _ a U.S.-built
military base in Vietnam that, a congressman says, could one day
end up back in American hands.
   The Armed Services Committee delegation wants to visit the base
as part of a 10-day trip to Vietnam, Guam, Singapore and Indonesia
that is scheduled to end on April 17. The mission's purpose is to
explore alternatives to United States military bases in the
Philippines and examine U.S. security responsibilities in the
region.
   The Soviet Union moved into Cam Ranh Bay after the Vietnam War,
but Pentagon officials said in January that the Soviets had
withdrawn some fighter planes and bombers. Visiting the base would
require both Soviet and Vietnamese cooperation.
   Vietnamese officials surprised several American lawmakers
recently by suggesting privately that the United States might be
allowed to return to the base if relations between the countries
continue to warm, Rep. Tom Ridge, R-Pa., said in an interview last
week.
   The lease on the six U.S. military installations in the
Philippines expires in 1991, and American officials are
anticipating difficult negotiations for continued base rights there.
   The possibility of the Soviets completing their withdrawal at
Cam Ranh Bay and the Americans returning was raised in February at
a forum in Bali, Indonesia, sponsored by the Henry R. Luce
Foundation, Ridge said. He said he attended the forum along with
several other congressmen and a group of top-ranking Vietnamese
government officials.
   ``That possibility was discussed and under the right set of
circumstances I think the Vietnamese would welcome it,'' said
Ridge, who is the only member of Congress to have seen Vietnam War
combat as an enlisted man.
   ``One of the ranking Vietnamese officials said, `I can see the
day when American ships are docked in Cam Ranh Bay,''' Ridge said,
adding that the official later specified that he meant warships.
   ``We said, `Do you mean just for refueling?' and they said, `No,
for repairs,''' Ridge said.
   Ridge said conditions of the forum prevented him from
identifying the Vietnamese official.
   Ridge said an American takeover at Cam Ranh Bay would be a
natural outgrowth of normalized relations with Vietnam, and that it
would make sense because ``we built it.''
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., who also attended the meeting,
said returning to Cam Ranh Bay ``would require some major changes
in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam.''
   But Atkins, who declined to discuss specifics of the meeting,
also said: ``I think the Vietnamese are desperate. Their economy is
in a state of continued deterioration. I think they're willing to
look at or think about anything that doesn't endanger their
national security that would allow them to rejoin the economic
community and modernize.''
   Seven congressmen hope to visit Cam Ranh Bay in the next week to
determine the extent of the Soviet reductions there, said
delegation leader Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the
House Armed Services subcommittee that oversees military bases.
   Such a visit will require both Vietnamese and Soviet approval
``so I don't know if we'll get there or not,'' Schroeder said
Friday. The subcommittee said it could not release a timetable for
such a visit because of security considerations. The trip ends in
Hawaii on April 17.
   Schroeder emphasized that the purpose of the trip was
informational.
   ``We in the U.S. Congress cannot negotiate with either the
Soviets or the Vietnamese on Cam Ranh Bay, but it is a very
important facility and it is in a country that appears to be in a
positive transition more towards our side,'' Schroeder said.
   Regardless of what happens with Cam Ranh Bay, she said she
wanted to uncover base alternatives because ``some in the
Philippines are demanding that we pay $2 billion a year in rent''
to keep U.S. installations there.
   The United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic or trade
relations. The State Department says it will consider relations
only after verification of Vietnamese troop withdrawals from
Cambodia, and after a process of internationally supervised
elections in Cambodia is established.
   The State Department has no received no offer from the
Vietnamese about Cam Ranh Bay, according to a department official
who spoke last week on condition of anonymity.
   In 1988, the Soviets offered to abandon Cam Ranh Bay if the
United States did the same with its Philippines bases. The U.S.
rejected the offer, saying it needed the Pacific bases to support
its worldwide operations.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Political Support for B-2 Plummeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Backing for the B-2 stealth bomber is
virtually invisible these days.
   Congressional opponents of the radar-evading aircraft are
turning up the volume in their rhetorical offensive _ part of a
struggle over a White House-favored weapon that in a sense sums up
this year's battle over military spending.
   ``What we ought to do is have the guts now to say enough is
enough and stop at the 15 that are in production,'' Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., told a Capitol Hill news conference last week.
   On Thursday, two Republicans on the Senate Armed Services
Committee _ a panel that last year largely supported President
Bush's defense blueprint _ chastised him for reacting too slowly to
changes in Eastern Europe, and worked their opposition to the B-2
into the argument.
   Sens. William Cohen of Maine and John McCain of Arizona called
for a reduction in the Air Force's plan to buy 132 of the planes.
Cohen said he favors canceling the plane altogether while McCain
indicated he could go either way on canceling the plane.
   One day earlier, a bipartisan group of senators urged
cancellation as they released a congressional study concluding that
slowing it down would raise the cost of a single plane from about
$530 million to more than $1 billion.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a B-2 proponent, summed up the handwriting on the
wall.
   ``Any time you have a weapons system start showing up on
`Saturday Night Live' and in the cartoons, you know it's got
trouble,'' Nunn said. ``The B-2 is in that category.''
   In the House, Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., said legislation that
would stop procurement of the B-2 bomber after the 15 currently in
production has 195 backers among the 434 members.
   Acknowledging the growing opposition, Air Force Secretary Donald
Rice said earlier this week that the service is reviewing possible
alternatives to buying all 132 planes now sought.
   Nunn, whose decisions on defense issues largely determine which
way the Senate goes, made it clear to the Air Force and the plane's
manufacturer, Northrop Corp., that the numbers on the B-2 have to
change.
   ``I think the cost of the B-2 has to be brought down either
through the per unit cost coming down, which is the best way, or
through lowering the number of units,'' he said.
   In this year's debate between Congress and the Bush
administration over defense spending, little has been said on the
issues that captured the spotlight in past years.
   Land-based nuclear missiles have received some mention. Base
closings disappeared after the initial cries of partisan politics.
The Strategic Defense Initiative hasn't been discussed since Bush's
trips earlier this year to test sites in California.
   Rather the debate has centered on the B-2 bomber and several
simple questions:
   Does the nation need a penetrating bomber to attack mobile
targets in the Soviet Union when the Warsaw Pact has collapsed as a
military alliance and the Kremlin is faced with economic woes and
ethnic unrest?
   As the federal deficit increases, can the country afford the
most expensive aircraft in history when some suggest B-1 bombers
and B-52s equipped with cruise missiles will suffice until 2030?
   Will the government spend nearly $10 billion on a single program
in the mid-1990s?
   Faced with the public calls for cuts in defense, the parochial
military demands in an election year and the changing strategy,
many lawmakers find killing the B-2 an easy answer.
   The decision won't be made for several months, but for now the
issue provides an opportunity for opponents to provide the rhetoric.
   ``The stealth is a budgetary black hole _ it attracts and
devours public funds like a condensed star attracts and devours
light,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.

<HEAD>Murder up 4 Percent Nationwide in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>

   The number of murders nationwide increased 4
percent last year, up from the 3 percent rise the year before,
according to FBI statistics.
   Overall, violent crimes increased 5 percent while property
crimes rose 2 percent and the overall number of serious crimes
increased 3 percent, according to the figures released Sunday by
FBI Director William S. Sessions.
   The statistics are based on reports to police of crime index
offenses: murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft and arson. The FBI did
not release statistics on the number of murders or other crimes,
just the percentage changes.
   While many may think a smaller city is safer, that didn't hold
true for murder.
   The number of murders in cities of 10,000 to 49,999 increased a
whopping 12 percent last year. At the same time, cities of 50,000
to 99,999 saw a 5 percent decline.
   For larger cities, the number of murders rose 8 percent in
cities of 100,000 to 249,999; 2 percent in cities of 250,000 to
499,999; and 7 percent in cities of 500,000 and more.
   The number of murders declined 3 percent in rural areas and in
cities of fewer than 10,000 people, and decreased 2 percent in
suburban areas.
   Southern states experienced the largest increase in the number
of murders, up 7 percent. The Midwestern states saw an increase of
4 percent, while Northeastern and Western states had 2 percent
hikes.
   In previous years, the number of murders increased 3 percent in
1988 after declining 3 percent in 1987. In 1986, the number of
murders zoomed up by 9 percent.
   The national changes in the number of violent crimes not
including murder were: robbery up 7 percent; aggravated assault up
5 percent, and forcible rape up 1 percent.
   Among the property crimes, motor vehicle theft increased 9
percent and larceny-theft 2 percent. Burglary and arson both
declined 2 percent.
   Less densely populated areas saw smaller increases in the total
number of serious crimes.
   Suburban and rural areas as well as cities outside metropolitan
areas _ places where some 132.2 million people live _ recorded 2
percent increases in serious crimes.
   At the same, cities with populations over 50,000 _ places where
approximately 80.9 million people live _ showed a 3 percent
increase.
   The Southern and Western states reported 3 percent increases in
serious crimes, while the Northeastern and Midwestern states
reported 2 percent increases.
   The overall 3 percent increase in serious crimes from 1988 to
1989 compares with a 3 percent increase the year before; 2 percent
in 1987; 6 percent in 1986; and 5 percent in 1985, the FBI reported.
   The statistics for the overall number of violent crimes, like
the figures for murders, didn't follow a particular pattern based
on the size of cities.
   Violent crime increased 5 percent _ the national average _ in
cities with fewer than 10,000 people and in those with 50,000 to
99,999 people.
   It increased 6 percent in relatively small cities of 10,000 to
24,999 people, and in the largest cities with 1 million or more
residents.
   The largest increase in violent crimes _ 7 percent _ was found
in cities of 100,000 to 499,999 people. The smallest increase _ 3
percent _ was found in rural areas and in cities of 500,000 to
999,999 people.
   Suburban areas and cities of 25,000 to 49,999 shared increases
of 4 percent in the number of violent crimes.
   The information comes from preliminary analysis of Uniform Crime
Reporting statistics. The program collects information reported to
law enforcement authorities nationwide and covers an estimated 98
percent of the U.S. population. Final statistics are to be released
this summer, the FBI said.

   Pool expert ``Fast Eddie'' Parker, who
inspired the 1961 movie ``The Hustler'' and its sequel ``The Color
of Money,'' doesn't mind passing on his pool-playing tips now that
his hustling days are over.
   Parker, 58, who holds the world record for pocketing 22 balls in
one shot, gave a few pointers to the crowd at Persnickety's Grill
and Night Club in this central Georgia city Saturday night.
   ``We're old guys, we've had our day,'' Parker said. ``Now it's
time for the young guys to take over.''
   Parker began playing pool when he was only 9 years old and later
became a ``money player,'' making his living through hustling and
winning tournaments.
   In the late 1950s, Walter Tevis saw Parker play in Kentucky and
wrote a book titled ``The Hustler'' just a few months later.
   The book was made into a movie starring Paul Newman in 1961.
Paul Newman starred with Tom Cruise in ``The Color of Money,'' a
1986 sequel to ``The Hustler.''

   Princess Chulabhorn, the youngest
daughter of King Bhumibol of Thailand, dedicated a city square in
honor of her father in front of Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government.
   ``Our national hope for peace, freedom and a better quality of
life unites us regardless of the geographical distance of our two
nations and the difference in our cultures,'' the princess, a
scientist who was recently appointed the World Health
Organization's Goodwill Ambassador for International AIDS programs,
said during a brief ceremony Sunday.
   King Bhumibol, also known as King Phumiphon, was born in
Cambridge in 1927 when his father was a medical student at Harvard.
He inherited his crown from his brother in 1946, and is the longest
reigning monarch in the world.
   The king was a host of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery
Company of Massachusetts during its visit to Thailand last year as
part of a Far East tour.
   After the company returned to America, a resolution was
introduced to the City Council calling for the dedication. The
measure passed in September.

   After writing hits for groups and
performers such as Alabama and Jimmy Buffett, Mac McAnally is
finding his place on the charts.
   McAnally, a 31-year-old native of Belmont, Miss., has hit the
Top 10 on the country music charts with ``Back Where I Come From.''
   The song takes listeners to McAnally's past, when his father was
a school principal and his mother played piano for gospel quartets.
McAnally dropped out of high school to play piano and guitar in
bars.
   A loner in his early days, McAnally turned to songwriting.
   ``Spare time is the major export in Mississippi and I partook
gladly,'' he said in a recent interview.
   Alabama started the country-music ball rolling for McAnally in
1981 when the group recorded its version of ``Old Flame,'' and
Buffett had a hit with McAnally's ``It's My Job.''

   Drummer Tommy Lee of the flamboyant
heavy metal rock group Motley Crue suffered a mild concussion when
he fell while swinging down a rope from on-stage scaffolding during
a concert, authorities said.
   The heavily tattooed Lee, who is married to actress Heather
Locklear, was released Sunday from Yale-New Haven Hospital.
   Hospital spokesman Tom Urtz said that he did not know how the
26-year-old Lee fell except that the rappelling stunt ``was part of
the routine'' at the concert Saturday.
   Motley Crue is scheduled to perform Tuesday in Binghamton, N.Y.
Before launching its tour, the band pledged that even though all
members had undergone drug rehabilitation, its concerts would be
just as raucous as in the past.
   ``We don't just play rock 'n' roll, we live it,'' bassist Nikki
Sixx was quoted as saying in People magazine earlier this year.

   Actress Lee Remick says her battle with cancer
has changed the way she approaches life.
   ``I used to be anxious and eager _ gotta do everything and be
everywhere. No, I say, don't gotta. Don't gotta do anything! Except
not hurt anybody else,'' Remick said in the May issue of Ladies
Home Journal.
   Remick was in France filming a movie last year when she
developed a fever she couldn't shake. When she came home, doctors
confirmed that she had a massive tumor on one kidney and some of

<HEAD>Eyeing Re-Election Bid, Barry Tries to Trade in `Night Owl' Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Undaunted by drug and perjury charges, Mayor
Marion Barry is trying to shed his ``night owl'' image and present
himself as a changed man in preparation for what aides say will be
a re-election bid.
   Three weeks after returning to Washington fresh from nearly two
months of substance abuse treatment, Barry is making community
appearances and talking up issues such as drugs, crime and schools
that play well with voters.
   In speeches to key constituent blocs _ the elderly, low-income
residents and community-based church groups _ Barry has been
portraying himself as a new man, a person who is fighting
alcoholism but thinking more clearly than ever before.
   ``I feel a little bit like a prodigal son who got lost for a bit
... and then got back home,'' Barry told one group of supporters.
``Let me tell you, I'm glad to be back home.''
   Barry put his re-election plans on hold in the days follhas made no
public announcement about his
plans. But key advisers, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
the mayor intends to run again.
   One of Barry's closest political advisers said the mayor's
campaign staff has started planning campaign events.
   ``He will run,'' the adviser said. ``His thinking is, he still
has the support of many members of the community and he can beat
these charges, so why not run?''
   Barry, who was arrested at a downtown hotel after allegedly
being videotaped using cocaine, is scheduled for trial June 4 on
five misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and three felony
perjury charges related to his testimony before a grand jury about
drug use.
   If convicted of a felony, Barry would be barred from holding
office or running for re-election; conviction of a misdemeanor
would not bar him from office.
   ``Even if he is convicted of a misdemeanor, he thinks he can run
and win,'' said one aide. ``I don't think you will see anything
until after the trial.''
   The Washington Post quoted sources this weekend as saying that
Barry rejected a suggestion from his attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy,
that he plead guilty to a misdemeanor account of cocaine possession
to strengthen his chances of acquittal on more serious charges. The
paper said Barry refused to comment on his legal case.
   In an interview last week with The Associated Press, Barry
refused to reveal his political plans but he would not rule out a
run for a fourth four-year term.
   ``I'll make that decision at the right time,'' Barry said. ``I
still have the personal and political support of a lot of people,
and that gratifies me.''
   Public opinion polls taken after Barry's arrest found that the
mayor still had the support of between 20 percent and 25 percent of
the community. Barry strategists believe that if all five
candidates currently in the Democratic mayoral race are on the
ballot, the mayor could win.
   Candidates must file by July 5 to qualify for the Sept. 11
Democratic primary, which is tantamount to election in the
district. The deadline for filing as an independent candidate is
Aug. 13.
   Barry, who in 1988 proudly described himself as a ``night owl,''
now tries to project a public image of humility and commitment to
his family.
   At many public events, Barry concedes that he suffers from
alcoholism but also insists that he is beating the problem and can
govern effectively.
   Barry has been claiming a new understanding of the ravages of
substance abuse and has pledged to improve drug treatment programs
for the city's growing number of addicts.
   The mayor also is taking advantage of his incumbency to remain
in the public eye. Last Tuesday, while the declared mayoral
candidates appeared at an issues forum, Barry was at a nearby
hospital praising an anti-drug program he had started there last
year.
   ``He can certainly make a case that that problem is something in
his past, that drugs are something he has put behind him,'' a third
adviser said.

   Perhaps even now, pregnant wasps are waking
from their winter slumber at Kennedy Space Center to build paper
nests and lay eggs in the warm Florida sun.
   By September the eager young hatchlings will be swarming to look
for mates. The tops of 300-foot launch towers, built by humans for
trips to the stars, are favorite places for wasp courtship and
frenzied lovemaking.
   The swarming goes on until mid-December, weeks when workers at
the center are pestered and threatened by the wasps, says an
Agriculture Department report. Scientists are trying to rig
effective traps but admit those may take a few more years of
research.
   Entomologist Peter J. Landolt of the department's Agricultural
Research Service suspects the wasps mistake the tall launch towers
for their usual mating sites _ trees and hilltops.
   Thus, when the mating swarms leave nests built in bushes or on
houses, the launch towers and other manmade structures at the
center are the tallest things around.
   Landolt, who works for the agency's research laboratory in
Gainesville, Fla., said thousands of male wasps lead off the mating
ritual by swarming to Kennedy facilities. Favored gathering places
are around a launch pad's crane and near the crane motor's housing
room.
   The males search for anything that protrudes to sit on, a bolt,
for example. Then they rub their heads and tails on the perch to
release sex attractants, or pheromones, into the air to attract
females.
   They bite and wrestle, trying to knock each other off the
perches. It's a very competitive time. And there is a prize.
   ``We believe each male wants an ideal spot to sit and wait for
virgin females to arrive so he can mate,'' Landolt said. ``Every
male wants his pheromone odor to be strongest so that females will
be attracted to him.''
   Hundreds of female wasps, lured by the scents of sex-hungry
males and the tall towers, swarm to greet the thousands of suitors,
selecting the ones they desire. The couples mate in midair,
requiring about a minute.
   Once inseminated, the females fly into the crane housing room,
where they cluster together on walls to keep warm and protect
themselves from predators. Or they squeeze into cracks and crevices.
   The females remain there all winter, living off stored body fat
util spring, when they return to the ground to build nests of paper
they make by chewing bark from trees. Then they lay their eggs, use
themselves up protecting the brood and die in the fall.
   Meanwhile, the male wasps that were successful suitors during
the previous swarm season eventually die also, having ``dutifully
served their sole purpose in life,'' the report said. The
unsuccessful males also die, of course.
   The space center wasp project was reported by Jessica Morrison
Silva of the USDA agency's Beltsville, Md., staff in the current
issue of Agricultural Research magazine.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
asked USDA two years ago for help to control the wasps. So far,
Landolt and colleague Hal C. Reed have worked out what they think
is the wasp's annual mating ritual, but they aren't completely sure.
   For one thing, they have to be certain the wasps are mistaking
launch towers for tall trees. So Landolt and Reed plan to go into
the Everglades in search of nesting wasps in tall trees to
corroborate the theory.
   Eventually, they hope to isolate and reproduce the pheromones
used by the wasps in their sex rituals. With the synthetic sex
attractants, traps can be built to control the pests.
   Since the problem began five years ago, only one NASA employee
has been stung at the center, despite the large numbers of wasps.
But just seeing a thousand or more wasps buzzing around at 300 feet
can be hazardous by itself, Landolt said.
   Aside from the employee hazard, NASA wants to ensure that the
wasps don't enter a space shuttle's electronic and mechanical
equipment.
   ``Obviously, a shuttle liftoff is an effective and quick means
of controlling the wasp problem,'' Reed said.
   But NASA wants a less drastic way of curbing the wasps between
liftoffs.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Declaration Should Be Withdrawn, Soviet Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet official says Moscow is engaged in a
``political dialogue'' with Lithuania, but a Lithuanian calls that
claim a ``lie.''
   Vitaly Churkin, an advisor to the Soviet foreign ministry, also
said Sunday that Lithuania should withdraw its declaration of
independence so negotiations about the Baltic State's future can
proceed.
   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's government wants to resolve
the Lithuanian situation ``through political dialogue, and
obviously this is what is going on now,'' Churkin said. ``We are
thinking about it in those terms.''
   But Algimantis Cekuolis, a Lithuanian official, called that
statement a ``lie.''
   Both men appeared on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   ``They would be very happy to do anything to overthrow that
(Lithuanian) government, like using a military force from inside
and economical blockade from outside,'' Cekuolis said.
   ``That lie number three, that was told, that political dialogue
going on ... There is no political dialogue, if you don't mean this
Kalashnikov gun,'' he said.
   Lithuanians have tried to talk with the Soviets, but have only
managed to get three hours of time from one of Gorbachev's
deputies, he said.
   Churkin said the Lithuanians, who have demanded independence
from Moscow, acted precipitously in trying to secede before working
out details of their future relationship with the Soviet Union on
economic and other matters.

<HEAD>Bush Mourns AIDS Victim's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush mourned the death of AIDS
victim Ryan White, saying Americans must continue fighting the
deadly immune system disease.
   ``Barbara and I are deeply saddened with the death of Ryan
White,'' Bush said in a statement Sunday a few hours after the
18-year-old Indiana youth died in a hospital in Indianapolis.
   ``All Americans are impressed by his courage, strength and his
ability to continue fighting,'' the president said. ``Ryan's death
reaffirms that we as a people must pledge to continue the fight,
his fight against this dreaded disease.''
   Last week, Bush planted a tree in Indianapolis in honor of White.
   White was diagnosed as having AIDS in December 1984. He
contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome through a
blood-clotting agent used to treat his hemophilia.
   White gained national attention when he was barred from Western
Middle School near Kokomo, Ind., after school officials and parents
there rejected health authorities' reassurances that AIDS could not
be spread through casual contact with those infected.
   Later, he moved to Cicero, Ind., where he attended school.

<HEAD>GAO Head Says S&amp;L Bailout May Require Tax Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher says a
tax increase will be needed at some point to pay for escalating
losses among a third of the nation's savings and loan institutions.
   Bowsher this past week raised the estimated price tag for the
government's S&amp;L bailout from $257 billion to $325 billion, and
warned it could rise to $500 billion.
   ``This is one of the great financial disasters that we've ever
had in this country and it's going to have to be added onto all the
other problems we have in the federal budget,'' he said Sunday on
NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''
   ``When you get done making the cuts that you hope you can make
in defense and some of the other areas ... you're still going to
have to look at the revenue side of the budget,'' the head of the
congressional General Accounting Office said.
   Bowsher blamed the Bush administration's desire to meet deficit
reduction targets without a tax increase for underestimating the
size of the S&amp;L problem.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp., responsible for handling the
bailout, said the government ``simply didn't know in what bad
condition these S&amp;Ls were.''

   The new baby and the weekly commute from Los
Angeles were too much for NBC's Maria Shriver.
   That's why, she said, she no longer will anchor Saturday's ``NBC
Nightly News'' and co-anchor ``Sunday Today.''
   Shriver, who returned last week from maternity leave, announced
her decision Sunday as she rejoined ``Sunday Today'' for a farewell
appearance.
   She has co-anchored the show with Garrick Utley since it began
in 1987.
   Although Shriver, who gave birth to a daughter in December, will
stay with NBC News, her decision to leave ``Sunday Today'' may set
the stage for former Cable News Network anchorwoman Mary Alice
Williams to succeed her on the program.
   But NBC spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said no decision has been made
yet on who will replace Shriver. She declined to comment on
speculation about Williams, saying only that ``we're in discussions
with Mary Alice about her role at NBC and we'll have an
announcement later.''
   Shriver, who with Williams and Chuck Scarborough last year
anchored four much-criticized specials called ``Yesterday, Today &amp;
Tomorrow,'' will start doing a series of prime-time news specials.
She also will do occasional special segments for NBC's weeknight
news program anchored by Tom Brokaw.
   A former ``CBS Morning News'' anchorwoman, Shriver worked out an
arrangement with NBC News that permitted her to be bicoastal.
   Under that arrangement, she lived with her husband, actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, in Los Angeles and commuted each week for
Saturday's evening news in New York, ``Sunday Today'' in Washington
with Garrick Utley, and occasional specials.
   ``Having a child, I realized I could no longer keep up my weekly
commute from Los Angeles,'' Shriver said.
   She praised NBC for letting her stay as a ``vital member'' of
the news division while giving her more time to spend with her
family.
   ``It's difficult giving up my two coveted roles ... but I'm very
excited about my new prime-time assignment,'' said Shriver.
   Williams has said she's unhappy over what she feels is NBC News'
inability to make full use of her, according to a source close to
the situation.
   But Williams, who lives in New York, has refused to discuss with
reporters either her problems with NBC or talks that she and her
agent are having with NBC to resolve them.
   In a March 27 appearance on the ``McLaughlin'' talk show on
CNBC, she said she considers it ``tacky'' to discuss her
negotiations in public.
   But, without elaboration, she did say that her NBC contract
contains a clause that allows lets her leave under certain
conditions.

   They're hip. They're green. Cowabunga!
A quartet of pizza-chomping turtles has taken Hollywood by storm.
   What's next for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles? They have
their own comic book, a cartoon series, toys and now their own
movie that made $25.4 million at the box office in the biggest
spring opening in Hollywood history.
   ``Maybe an amusement park,'' co-creator Peter Laird said. ``It's
something that's crossed our minds a couple of times.''
   The movie ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' fell behind only
``Batman'' and ``Ghostbuster II'' for the biggest box office take
in a film's first three days, Exhibitor Relations Co. said last
week.
   ``We had a good feeling about the movie,'' Laird said. ``From
the beginning we thought it could do well, but not this well.''
   It's a long way from a winter's night seven years ago when Laird
and fellow starving artist Kevin Eastman dreamed up four
irreverent, adolescent creatures skilled in the martial arts and
named for Renaissance artists _ Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and
Donatello.
   Eastman and Laird are agog over the mutants' success.
   ``It's exciting. It's scary. It's tense. It's pinch yourself
once a day,'' Eastman said.
   ``It's been an exciting experience and exhilarating and so
forth,'' Laird said. ``It's also been a sobering and humbling
experience. We now know that people who get famous for what they do
are just ordinary people because that's what we are.''
   The amphibian brothers, intended as parodies of the big-muscled
heros of conventional comics, started as aquarium pets and mutated
after falling into a pool of radioactive goo in a New York sewer.
They were raised by Splinter, the mutant pet rat of a Ninja master,
and became radical crime fighters fond of the surfer cry
``cowabunga.''
   Eastman was a sandwich maker and Laird eked out a living drawing
illustrations for local newspapers when they met in 1982.
   The mutant turtles gurgled from their heads onto paper about a
year later after a late-night sketching duel that Eastman said was
fueled by an evening of watching bad television.
   From there, the green ``heroes in a half shell'' never looked
back.
   Laird and Eastman issued their first Ninja Turtle comic book in
1984, printed on $1,200 they scraped up between them. A smash TV
cartoon series and some serious marketing followed.
   There are about 100 licensed Ninja Turtle products, including
candy, cookies, a board game, a video game and 4-inch-tall action
figures that have been best-selling toys last two years.
   The creators, who live in Northampton, are often asked to
explain how four super turtles captured such a huge audience.
   ``I think they're appealing for a number of reasons,'' Laird
said. ``The turtles live their lives with the philosophy that they
don't want to hassle anybody and they don't want to be hassled
themselves. But when trouble comes they're able to handle it.''
   Eastman said fan letters range from crayoned missives to
correspondence from doctors and lawyers.
   ``I think the kids in some respects like _ beside the silliness
and the characters _ the family attitude with the four brothers and
Splinter playing the father figure and the teacher,'' he said.
   Keeping control over the myriad turtle products is becoming more
difficult, but Laird and Eastman said they've been careful to
monitor the marketing.
   ``We do still maintain the approval process because they are our
babies,'' Laird said.

<TEXT>
   Nick Faldo became only the second man to win
the storied Masters golf tournament two years in a row, snaring the
title from Raymond Floyd who blew a four-shot lead on the final six
holes.
   The Englishman did it in similar fashion to last year's victory,
winning on the second hole of a sudden-death playoff when Floyd's
approach found the pond.
   ``It's the most devastating thing that's happened to me in my
career,'' the distraught Floyd said.
   ``When you have a guy that you know is a great front-runner, it
sets your course,'' said Faldo, who won on the second hole of a
playoff with Scott Hoch last year.
   The two finished regulation with 10-under-par 278 totals. Both
had pars on the first extra hole.
   Floyd may have cost himself a second Masters title by playing
safe, hoping to par in for the victory that would make him, at 47,
the oldest Masters winner in history.
   Jack Nicklaus won this title for the sixth time in 1986, when he
was 46. Nicklaus also was the only back-to-back winner, in 1965 and
'66.
   It would have made Floyd the first player with a major
championship in four decades _ he won PGA crowns in 1969 and 1982,
the Masters in 1976 and the U.S. Open in 1986.

   An American performer believed killed in the
North Sea ferry fire that claimed about 150 lives had been looking
for her ``big break'' aboard the Scandinavian Star, her mother said.
   Ruth E. Rome, 27, part of a seven-member song-and-dance troupe
from New York City hired a week earlier to entertain passengers on
the overnight trip from Norway to Denmark, was missing and presumed
dead in the fire that began before dawn Saturday, her mother,
Winifred, said Sunday.
   Mrs. Rome of East Lansing, Mich., said her daughter had hoped
the one-month singing stint aboard the ferry would give her an
entrance into the entertainment industry.
   ``She hadn't had her big break,'' Mrs. Rome said. ``She was
always hoping. She was the eternal optimist.''
   Another member of the performance troupe Broadway on Board, Rick
Qualls, said in a telephone interview from Oslo, Norway, that he
and two other singers who survived the blaze had realized there was
a fire while they were watching videos in the officer's mess.
   Qualls, a native of Little Rock, Ark., said the three performers
tried to go down to a lower level where Ms. Rome had retired to her
cabin earlier. The staircase was littered with people who appeared
to be passed out; others were stampeding up the stairs to safety,
he said.
   ``We got down one deck and the smoke was gushing up the
stairwell, and looking down, we could see nothing _ not even the
stairs of that bottom deck, and there were people stampeding up the
stairs,'' he said.
   Qualls, 30, praised the Scandinavian Star's crew for trying to
save lives, but said the ferry was understaffed and that the alarm
never sounded until at least 15 minutes after the ship was on fire
and filled with smoke. The ship carried about 500 tourists and crew
members.
   He also said he said he never practiced an emergency drill on
the ship.
   ``I'm upset. I just feel like there's a lot of negligence here
that has cost a lot of lives, and possibly one in our party,''
Qualls, 30, said in a telephone interview from his Oslo, Norway,
hotel.
   Miss Rome moved to New York City after her 1984 graduation from
Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree in theater.
   ``She was just a wonderful, sweet, sweet, young and beautiful
girl,'' Qualls said.
   And she loved the stage, her mother said.
   ``She had worked recently on a cruise with American Hawaiian
Cruise,'' Mrs. Rome said in a telephone interview Sunday. ``Because
that was such a positive experience, she decided to try this out in
Norway.''

   In its fourth-largest single-day surge, the key
index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed above the 30,000-point
level Monday, while the dollar fell sharply against the Japanese
yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 1,119.15 points, or 3.82
percent, ending the day at 30,397.93. On Friday, the index rose
1,029.72 points in its fifth-largest single-day advance. The Nikkei
last closed higher than 30,000 points on March 29, when it ended
the day at 31,026.16.
   The dollar closed at 156.45 yen Monday, down 1.02 yen from
Friday's close of 157.47 yen. It opened lower at 155.80 yen and
then began to rise, ranging between 155.60 yen and 156.90 yen
during the day.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds was 86.81 at 3 p.m., up from Friday's close of
86.38. Their yield fell to 7.185 percent from 7.275 percent on
Friday.
   The dollar rose quickly as market players with short, or
oversold positions started buying the U.S. currency in the absence
of coordinated intervention by the central banks of the Group of
Seven (G-7) nations, said Minori Takeuchi, a dealer with Chemical
Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Investors had expected that the dollar would be pushed down
further by coordinated dollar-selling intervention. Since that did
not materialize today no matter how long they waited, market
players finally started buying dollars again,'' she said.
   Monetary authorities from the G-7 _ Britain, Canada, France,
West Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States _ agreed in their
meeting in Paris Saturday that the yen's recent downswing could
have ``undesirable consequences.''
   They also promised to keep the exchange markets ``under review''
and renewed their commitment to coordinate economic policies,
including cooperation on exchange markets.
   But analysts believe that many countries are reluctant to help
Japan stem the fall in the yen because they see the yen's weakness
as Japan's internal problem. Japan's central bank also insists that
it will not raise its official discount rate.
   Japan's Finance Minister Ryotaro Hashimoto, who returned from
the G-7 meeting Sunday, told an upper house budget committee
session Monday morning that participants in the G-7 meeting shared
concern over higher interest rates.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the yen might rise a certain extent but only
temporarily. She said that will not change the dollar's uptrend
``because there is no other means beside market intervention to
revive the yen.''
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said many
currency players believed that the G-7 countries had committed
themselves firmly to preventing a further slide in the yen.
   He said the market was testing how closely the G-7 countries
would cooperate in joint market intervention.
   On the stock market, Nomura Securities analyst Hisato Haganuma
attributed the index's large gains to rises in the dollar and bond
prices.
   ``Market players bought a broad range of issues, including
electric issues,'' he said.
   But Haganuma said the surges Monday and Friday may not lead to
further rises in stock prices. ``Currently, market players are
short of stocks to sell, because few investors were buying issues
when the index was falling last week, particularly since the index
fell from the 32,000-point mark,'' he said.
   After a round of buying, the index's uptrend will slow and hit a
plateau, he said.
   Toshiyuki Nushiguchi, an analyst with Daiwa Securities Co., said
the stock market responded favorably to last week's Japan-U.S.
structural trade talks as well as to the G-7 meeting.
   He said speculation on interest rate-sensitive issues had
disappeared after the G-7 meeting. Some market participants had
feared that participating countries might raise their interest
rates to stem inflation.
   Higher interest rates tend to support a country's currency, but
discourage stock investment.

   Farm Aid IV mixed fund raising with
political lobbying in a 14-hour concert on behalf of the American
family farmer.
   A sellout crowd of about 45,000 people at the Hoosier Dome heard
more than 60 musicians _ including Elton John, Bonnie Raitt,
Jackson Browne and the band Crosby, Stills and Nash _ perform in
the Saturday night show.
   ``It would be nice if there wasn't a need for Farm Aid. It would
be nice if our government's policies reflected a concern for
families and for farming. There's all kinds of things in this world
that would be nice. We have to fight to make this government
responsive to our needs,'' Browne said.
   Donations for the fourth Farm Aid concert were still being
tallied Sunday, and final figures were not scheduled to be released
until today, said Farm Aid spokeswoman Linda Lewi. As of late
Saturday, $1.3 million had been raised, she said.
   The concert came two weeks before the nation observes the 20th
anniversary of Earth Day, and Willie Nelson and other Farm Aid
leaders took the opportunity to announce the forging of a coalition
with farmers, environmentalists and consumers to work toward less
use of pesticides and other chemicals in food production and more
support for organic farming.
   Postcards were distributed to concertgoers calling on Congress
to pass a 1990 farm bill that will help family farmers use fewer
chemicals and practice environmentally safe farming methods and to
provide a pricing structure that covers the cost of food production.
   Rock star John Mellencamp, who helped organize the event,
indicated in an interview that federal farm policy has sacrificed
the welfare of the independent farmer to promote corporate
agriculture concerns.
   ``I'm not giving up. The face of this nation changes by the men
that we admire, right, and I think that we haven't felt the
backlash of the last eight years yet. I think the '90s will reflect
that,'' said Mellencamp,
   Mellencamp, Farm Aid President Nelson and fellow organizer Neil
Young all played during the final, all-star hour of the marathon
concert.
   John made an unexpected appearance late in the program and
performed three songs. The British rock singer had been in
Indianapolis to visit AIDS patient Ryan White, who died Sunday.
   ``This one's for Ryan,'' John said before beginning ``Candle in
the Wind,'' a song he wrote about the tragic life of Marilyn
Monroe. The song drew the biggest ovation of the show.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a moment of silence for White
during the concert. The civil rights activist and Democratic
politician visited White's family on Saturday, as did Nelson and
musician-actor Kris Kristofferson.

   Celebrated novelist Mario Vargas Llosa won the
most votes in Peru's presidential elections, but a politically
independent agronomist who surged from behind has forced a runoff,
unofficial returns showed today.
   This fragile democracy is wracked by economic crisis and the
10-year-old insurgency by the Maoist-inspired Shining Path, which
staged attacks during Sunday's voting and in preceding weeks in an
effort to thwart the election.
   Soldiers armed with automatic weapons protected polling
stations, several of which were attacked Sunday by guerrillas
hurling sticks of dynamite. Police reported no injuries in those
attacks and millions of voters turned out to vote for a president
and new congress.
   Unofficial returns early today showed Vargas Llosa, a
54-year-old advocate of free market reforms and economic shock
therapy, leading with 33.9 percent of the vote _ far short of the
50 percent required to avoid a runoff.
   Alberto Fujimori, the 51-year-old son of Japanese immigrants,
garnered 29 percent, pushing aside the candidate of the center-left
governing party, Luis Alva Castro, who a few weeks ago held a solid
second in the polls.
   Fujimori, a former university rector, has in his shoe-string
campaign stressed ``honor, technology and work,'' qualities many
associate with his Japanese ancestry. But he never provided a
detailed plan of government.
   He is one of about 100,000 people of Japanese descent in the
country and many voters said they thought he could attract
substantial Japanese investment to this country where 70 percent of
people are underemployed or unemployed.
   Independent pollsters gave Fujimori a better-than-even chance of
defeating Vargas Llosa in the second round of voting, expected in
late May or early June. The new president will be inaugurated on
July 28.
   The unofficial results showed Alva Castro to have won 16.4
percent of the vote. Six other presidential candidates split the
remaining vote.
   Official results were expected to take up to 20 days, as many
polling stations were in remote villages. Voting is mandatory for
those 18 and older.
   Guerrillas staged attacks throughout the country on Sunday, but
most of the country's 9.8 million registered voters appeared to
ignore rebel threats for death for those casting ballots.
   In recent weeks, the guerrillas have assassinated six
congressional candidates and killed or wounded dozens of people in
recent weeks, aiming to disrupt the election.
   At least 28 people were killed and 44 wounded in weekend
attacks, including 17 peasants massacred by rebels in Santo Tomas
de Pata, a village near Ayacucho. Also, two rebels died when a
dynamite charge blew up as they placed it on a highway bridge 100
miles east of Lima. A third was seriously injured.
   The highest absentee ratio was registered in the Ayacucho, a
Shining Path stronghold 235 miles southeast of Lima in the Andean
highlands, where 38 percent of voters stayed away.
   Three quarters of the votes cast in Ayacucho were blank or null,
compared to about 10 percent nationwide, according to the respected
polling firm Datum. Repression by the military is particularly
severe in the region, and human rights violations are frequent.
   Vargas Llosa's campaign often had the aspect of a crusade as he
condemned the ``collectivist'' programs of President Alan Garcia
and leftist candidates.
   Many Peruvians blame Garcia, who is barred by the constitution
from serving consecutive five-year terms, for the severe economic
crisis and growing political violence tearing apart this country of
22 million.
   They point, in particular, to his attempt to nationalize the
country's banks after discouraging foreign investment by dictating
his own terms for repaying outstanding loans.
   Inflation is running at more than 2,000 percent annually and
more than 18,000 people, most of them civilians, have been killed
in 10 years of violence between the Shining Path and government
security forces.
   Vargas Llosa has repeatedly said he put aside his writing to
help his country. But some of his former backers were turned off by
the lavish campaign waged by the novelist's center-right Democratic
Front coalition.
   Appearing together in a downtown hotel, Vargas Llosa and
Fujimori applauded the massive voter turnout, an apparent rejection
of Garcia's governing Aprista Party.
   Vargas Llosa invited Fujimori to join him in ``frank
conversation'' to discuss a possible accord to avoid a second
round. But Fujimori said he would not step aside.
   ``There has been in this first round two proposals for change,''
Fujimori said. ``I believe a second round is necessary to debate
our proposals. The verdict should be the public's.''
   Sunday's vote indicated the next president will face a divided
congress. No party gained a working majority among the 60 senators
and 180 representatives.

   The Japanese community is as perplexed as the
rest of Peru by Alberto Fujimori, who vaulted from relative
obscurity into a runoff vote in the presidential election in a
matter of weeks.
   Unofficial returns after Sunday's voting showed Fujimori had
forced a second round of voting by garnering enough ballots to deny
the long-time favorite, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, a simple
majority.
   Until the final days of the campaign, hardly anyone knew of the
51-year-old agronomist. Six weeks ago, his own polls showed him
with less that one percent support.
   ``His popularity is very surprising,'' said Juan Iida, publisher
of a Japanese language newspaper in Lima. ``We didn't even know who
he was.''
   Fujimori, a former rector of the National Agricultural
University, served for two years as an agricultural advisor to the
government of President Alan Garcia. He is married with four
children.
   One of almost 100,000 Peruvians of Japanese descent, Fujimoro
has played on common Japanese stereotypes in his shoe-string
campaign, whose slogan promises ``honesty, work, technology.''
   He also has not discouraged the belief that he will attract
Japanese aid and investment to this impoverished, war-ravaged
country.
   The Japanese community, however, remains unimpressed by
Fujimoro. According to pollsters, Japanese Peruvians believe
Fujimori does not reflect the values of their community and is too
``Peruvian.''
   ``I doubt he has any real program,'' said Amelia Morimoto of the
Japanese Peruvian Cultural Center. ``His candidacy seems very
improvised.''
   Indeed, most of Fujimoro's campaign workers are youths from
Lima's poor districts and his political movement, called simply
``Change 90,'' has only two sparsely furnished offices in Lima.
   Fujimoro, who has no political experience, says he sold his
house, car and a tractor to fund the campaign and often travels
without bodyguards because he says he can't afford them.
   Some people who worked under Fujimori when he was university
rector from 1984 to 1989 have questioned his ability to govern.
They dispute his claim he left the school with a $7 million budget
surplus.
   If elected, he would be the first Japanese Peruvian to occupy a
high government post.
   ``What is important for Japanese Peruvians is that this may lead
to wider acceptance by the other Peruvians,'' Ms. Morimoto said.
   Fujimoro's parents came to Lima before World War II from
Kumamoto, Japan, in a wave of immigration that began in 1899. Most
Japanese families arrived in Peru to work on cotton and sugar
plantations along the coast and many now own businesses and
factories or work as doctors, lawyers and engineers.
   Fujimori seems as surprised as anyone at his sudden popularity.
   ``I'm not a dreamer, but, yes, I propose to become president of
Peru,'' he said recently.

<HEAD>`Community Policing' Focus of Conference</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few years ago, charges of police
brutality made headlines in the border town of McAllen, Texas.
Today, residents come to a neighborhood mini-station to drop off
plates of food for officers.
   Sgt. Belinda Cowan credits the smoother relations to the
department's switch three years ago to ``community policing'' _ a
philosophy that is the subject of a conference today and Tuesday at
Michigan State University.
   Officers may patrol on foot, staff a small office or drive a
patrol car, but the key to community policing is face-to-face
contact with neighborhood residents, said Robert Trojanowicz,
director of Michigan State's School of Criminal Justice.
   Cowan said the results are striking.
   ``We're seeing tremendous support from citizens because we're
working together as partners,'' she said. ``It's no longer, `I'm
the police. Just the facts, ma'am.' They are a part of our
department.''
   About 300 cities use some form of community policing and get
similar results, Trojanowicz said.
   Community policing advocates planned to describe at the
conference how this decentralized form of police work, which became
popular in the late 1970s, can stop drugs from overwhelming
neighborhoods.
   Officers in community policing programs work in the same
neighborhood for at least a year, getting to know the area's
problems and enlisting the help of citizens in fighting crime,
fixing up the neighborhood and other programs.
   ``With this personalized approach to police work, officers have
more contact, more communication with the public,'' Trojanowicz
said. ``Trust is built up and information is exchanged that would
not otherwise be exchanged and information is the lifeblood of
police work.''
   Community police officers try to get to the root of problems, as
in Aurora, Colo., where police had frequent reports of women's
purses being ripped off in car break-ins at a popular nightclub in
the Denver suburb.
   ``Typical police response would have been to go out and take
reports on stolen purses over and over and never go further,'' said
Aurora Police Chief Jerry Williams.
   Instead, the Aurora officer encouraged the nightclub owner to
build lockers where women could safely leave their purses while
dancing. The crimes stopped.
   Police mobilize citizens into neighborhood watch groups,
encourage people to testify in court, find out which children
aren't attending school and pressure city leaders to tear down
dilapidated buildings that are eyesores or havens for crime.
   That can mean less time for responding to minor complaints like
barking dogs, Trojanowicz said, adding citizens are encouraged to
handle those things themselves.
   In McAllen, police received more reports of crime in the first
year after community policing began, possibly because citizens were
more willing to file reports, Cowan said.
   ``The negative rap on community policing is it's public
relations, grin and wave, it humors people and doesn't cure
anything,'' Trojanowicz said. ``The focus of the conference is to
show it is real policing and to show it in fact can get rid of drug
dealers.''
   Some police fear for their safety if they spend less time in
patrol cars and more time in direct contact with citizens, but
Trojanowicz said citizens are more likely to come to the aid of an
officer they know.
   ``Studies have shown that as officers have become more
personalized, if they are in danger, it's a little more difficult
for citizens to be aloof,'' he said. ``He has a stake in the
neighborhood and the neighborhood has a stake in him.''

<BYLINE>O'Connor Defends Anti-Abortion Project

<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor defended the Roman
Catholic Church's hiring of a public relations concern to launch an
anti-abortion campaign, saying the move is neither a waste of money
nor unusually political.
   ``We believe that the most critical issue in the United States
is the problem of abortion, and if we believe that, then we should
try to use the best possible means to communicate,'' O'Connor said
after Sunday Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   O'Connor announced Thursday that the nation's Roman Catholic
bishops had engaged a public relations concern, Hill &amp; Knowlton,
and a polling company, the Wirthlin Group, to conduct a campaign
opposing abortion.
   But he said that, contrary to some recent reports, no contract
has been signed with the companies.
   O'Connor, chairman of the bishops' Committee for Pro-Life
Activities, said no price tag has been put on the project, but some
reports have said the bishops are expected to spend $3 million to
$5 million on the effort.
   Funds would be raised from private individuals and
organizations, and would not detract from existing programs, said
O'Connor's spokesman, Joe Zwilling.
   Some critics have charged that the money going to the project
could be better spent on the poor. But O'Connor said the Catholic
Church spends billions of dollars annually on care for the needy
and homeless.
   ``I'm not sure why the criticism, except again I find that
whenever I do anything or say anything about any public policy
problem, except abortion, there's practically no criticism,'' he
said.
   The Catholic bishops have hired media consultants for events
like Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States in 1987 but
never before for the abortion issue.
   ''I've heard that Christ wouldn't have used a communications
program,'' O'Connor said. ``Well, Christ never established a child
care institution or an orphanage. Christ was able to work miracles
to feed people. I can't do that. I have to raise money to do that.''

<TEXT>
   The Foreign Ministry said today that it was
expelling an American diplomat in retaliation for the expulsion
from the United States of an Iraqi diplomat accused by Washington
of involvement in a murder plot.
   The ministry announcement, carried by the official Iraqi news
agency, did not name the American to be expelled.
   An unidentifed spokesman for the ministry was quoted as saying,
``The accusation against the Iraqi diplomat has no basis in truth.''
   The source said the American action was part of ``repeated
hysterical campaigns to harm Iraq in order to serve the aggressive
purposes of Israel.''
   In Washington on Saturday, the State Department said it had
expelled an Iraqi diplomat posted at the United Nations because of
his suspected role in an alleged plot to murder two opponents of
the Baghdad government.
   The diplomat, who was not identified, was expelled for ``abuse
of his privileges of residence in the United States,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman.
   ``Given the nature of the diplomat's actions, it would be
inappropriate for the government of Iraq to take any retaliatory
action,'' the spokeswoman said.
   She said the department could not provide more specific
information except to confirm the expulsion was linked to an
investigation in California. But government sources said on
condition of anonymity that the expulsion was linked to a plot to
assassinate two Iraqi opposition members in the United States.
   A newspaper in California identified the targets of the plot as
Sargon Dadesho, a leader of the Assyrian community in California's
Central Valley, and an unidentified Kurdish leader.
   Iraq has been the focus of international criticism for two
months over a series of incidents. The latest was President Saddam
Hussein's statement that he would use binary chemical weapons if
attacked by Israel. Chemical weapons have been banned under a 1925
international agreement.
   Saddam's threats came after Iraq ignored international pleas and
hanged an Iranian-born British journalist whom Baghdad branded an
Israeli spy. They also followed accusations by the United States
and Britain that Iraq had tried to smuggle atomic bomb triggers
into the country, a charge Iraq has denied.
   Meanwhile, the Qatari newspaper al-Raya quoted informed sources
as saying President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt relayed to Saddam a
message from President Bush in which he said the U.S.
administration was ``no party to the propaganda campaign against
Iraq.''
   Al-Raya said the two Arab leaders considered Bush's message ``a
positive response that calls for self-control and non-escalation of
the propaganda war.''
   Baghdad last expelled an American diplomat in November 1988.
   Haywood Rankin, head of the embassy's political section, was
kicked out for alleged close contacts with Iraq's Kurdish minority,
which has been fighting for autonomy for 50 years.

<TEXT>
   Top executives are being shuffled at
the newly opened Taj Mahal Casino Resort, which has had problems
keeping its slot machines open, a spokeswoman said.
   Walter J. Haybert, who has been Taj Mahal president and chief
executive officer since October 1989, would become chief financial
officer, spokeswoman Karen Tuso said Sunday.
   Taj Mahal executive vice president W. Bucky Howard would be
named president and chief operations officer.
   ``As a casino operator, Bucky is one of the best,'' owner Donald
Trump said in a statement read by Ms. Tuso. ``He will provide the
leadership that will ensure the Trump Taj Mahal its place as the
world's greatest casino and convention resort.''
   Trump said none of the proposed changes resulted from persistent
slot machine trouble at the 1,250-room casino hotel, which opened
April 2 billed as ``The Eighth Wonder of the World.''
   The Taj Mahal ran into trouble Friday night when its 3,000 slot
machines were shut down after an unexpectedly high volume of
action. The slots had opened six hours late Friday because of staff
shortages and problems accounting for the amount of money in the
machines.
   The slots will be out of service indefinitely to allow for
procedural changes, officials said.
   The casino, which was under construction for eight years, must
win at least $1 million a day to service the debt on $675 million
in bonds.
   In another change, Edward Tracy would be named president and
chief executive officer of the Trump Hotel Corp. while continuing
as president and chief operations officer of Trump Castle Casino
Resort, a position he has held since November 1989, Ms. Tuso said.
   The Trump Hotel Corp. manages Trump's four Atlantic City
properties.
   The proposed changes must be approved by the state Casino
Control Commission.
   Haybert also had been vice president of Harrah's in 1984 when it
managed Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. At the time, more than 50
percent of the Plaza's slot machines were closed during its first
three weeks, and Haybert resigned midway through that crisis.

   The liberal republic of Slovenia
held Yugoslavia's first free multiparty elections since 1945 and
the presidential candidate who favored a cautious approach to
secession won the most votes.
   But former Communist Milan Kucan did not gain an absolute
majority in Sunday's balloting and faces an April 22 runoff vote
with Joze Pucnik, a former political prisoner of the DEMOS
opposition coalition, returns showed today.
   Political analysts predicted a neck-and-neck race between
Pucnik, who advocates quick Slovenian independence from Yugoslavia,
and Kucan, who has called for a more cautious political approach.
   About 75 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, choosing among
17 parties for a new Slovenian Parliament and among four candidates
for president.
   With 90 percent of ballots counted, Kucan led with 44.5 percent
of the vote to 26.1 percent for Pucnik. Independent candidate Ivan
Kramberger won 18.8 percent and Liberal Party candidate Marko
Demsar took 10.5 percent.
   The first-round results ``suggest that Slovenians have opted for
a peaceful transition from a single-party monopoly to a
parliamentary democracy,'' said Kucan, an engineer of the
republic's move toward democracy.
   Pucnik, who spent seven years in Slovenian prisons in the 1950s
for his opposition to communism, said he would win the runoff
``because those who voted for Kramberger and Demsar will now
probably vote for me.''
   Early returns from Sunday's balloting indicated the Slovenian
Communists, who recently renamed themselves the Party of Democratic
Renewal, would be the largest single party in the republic's
Parliament but would face a tough DEMOS coalition of five
conservative parties.
   The former Communists, who have also broken with the national
Communist Party leadership because it has resisted democratic
reform, won about 21 percent of the vote in balloting for the
republic's 240-seat Parliament, with the five DEMOS parties getting
about 35 percent, returns showed.
   Official results of parliamentary voting were not expected until
Tuesday due to a slow and complicated counting process.
   Yugoslavia's president Janez Drnovsek, a Slovene, said after
voting in Ljubljana that he hoped the whole country would hold its
first free elections for federal parliament by year's end.
   Elections in Slovenia, the richest and most liberal of the six
Yugoslav republics, ``represent a sign of the democracy drive that
cannot be stopped in Yugoslavia,'' Drnovsek said.
   Slovenians have shown an increased desire to secede from
Yugoslavia because they are unhappy with resistance to reform in
much of the rest of the country, especially Serbia
   Slovenians have moved toward democracy despite harsh criticism
and economic boycotts from Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, a
bastion of centrallized control where the leaders demand continued
Communist Party dominance.
   Croatia, the second-largest republic, is scheduled to hold free
parliamentary elections later in April.
   Despite allowing the formation of oposition parties, Communists
in the other four republics, including Serbia, have not yet
announced free elections.
   Official Serbian media, under strong Communist influence,
virtually ignored the Slovenian elections, claiming the Slovenian
parties and presidential candidates have one goal in common:
secession from Yugoslavia.

   With Easter just a week away, Georgia's egg
producers have a lot to cluck about.
   For the first time since 1977, when native son Jimmy Carter was
president, Georgia is providing eggs for the annual White House egg
roll.
   The state's egg producers are sending 2,500 eggs, including a
commemorative egg for first lady Barbara Bush, for the event in
Washington.
   The White House event, coordinated by the American Egg Board and
the Georgia Egg Commission, traditionally takes place on the Monday
after Easter Sunday.
   The commemorative egg, made by Kay Harrison of Canton, sits on a
small gold pedestal. Mrs. Harrison cut a hole in the side in the
outline of the state. Inside are three dogwood blossoms carved from
clay.
   Georgia is the nation's fifth-largest egg producing state, with
11.8 million commercial laying hens that lay nearly 3 billion eggs
a year.
   Eggs have figured into Easter celebrations for centuries.
   ``Eggs are a symbol of new life, and people believe eggs given
at this time bring them good luck,'' said Robert Howell, executive
director of the state's Egg Commission. ``It's been a custom to
color, decorate and exchange eggs for hundreds of years.''

   Political pundits who like to point out
what a difference one vote can make can now use this small Texas
town as an example.
   Residents voted 51-50 on Saturday to allow the sales of package
beer and wine in an election that drew more ballots than any in the
town's history. Only three registered voters did not participate.
   And those three who failed to vote are bound to be badgered a
bit by voters from the losing side, Mayor Jim Clinkscales said.
   ``I know one of those who didn't vote,'' Clinkscales said. ``And
it wouldn't be too hard to narrow it down to find out the others.''
   Opposition to beer and wine sales at the town's two grocery
stores came primarily from members of the town's three churches.
   Those arguing in favor of going ``wet'' tried to convince
neighbors already struggling under hefty sewer tax bills that
liquor and beer sales would provide badly needed revenue for the
town of 282 people about 30 miles south of Fort Worth.
   ``I really didn't take much of a stand on it,'' said
Clinkscales, who refused to divulge which way he voted. ``But I
will say I'm going to be glad to see more tax coming in from it.
   ``A lot of people said this is going to bring us heavier traffic
and people throwing trash in our town. But there's already a place
that sells beer a half-mile west of our town now, and people drive
through here and toss down trash and we don't get any revenue from
it.''

   The dollar closed sharply lower against the
Japanese yen today, helping to push the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key
index above 30,000 points for the first time since late March.
   The dollar closed at 156.45 yen, down 1.02 yen from Friday's
close of 157.47 yen. It opened at 155.80 yen and then rose, trading
between 155.60 yen and 156.90 yen during the day.
   Bolstered by the yen's recovery, the 225-share Nikkei Stock
Average rose 1,119.15 points, or 3.82 percent, to close at
30,397.93, its fourth largest single-day advance ever. The Nikkei
last closed above 30,000 points on March 29, when it ended the day
at 31,026.16.
   The advance extended a rebound begun on Friday, when the Nikkei
index rose 1,029.72 points in its fifth-largest single-day advance.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo after wildly fluctuating
between 155.50-159.50 in Oceanian markets, mainly Sydney, that
opened earlier than Tokyo, dealers said.
   They said the dollar fell because of expectations of central
bank intervention to prop up the faltering Japanese yen in the wake
of talks among economic policymakers of the major industrialized
nations, known as the Group of Seven, in Paris this weekend.
   Monetary authorities from Britain, Canada, France, West Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States agreed Saturday that the yen's
recent downswing in world currency markets could have ``undesirable
consequences.''
   They also promised to keep the exchange markets ``under review''
and renewed their commitment to coordinate economic policies,
including cooperation on exchange markets.
   Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a leading Japanese economic journal,
reported on its front page this morning that central banks from G-7
would conduct coordinated dollar-selling interventions during
today's tradings to support the yen.
   The dollar, which traded at 143.40 yen at the end of last year,
surged almost 20 yen during the last three months to 160 yen before
falling back slightly.
   Many analysts believe, however, that some G-7 countries are
reluctant to help Japan prop up its currency because they see the
yen's weakness as a domestic problem. Expectations of possible
intervention to curb the dollar's rising value, they say, are
temporarily helping the yen.
   ``The dollar's uptrend will slow down temporarily because market
players are now reluctant to push it up because they fear
intervention. But the dollar will soon start rising again,'' said
Kenzo Shinomiya, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   He predicted the dollar would fall only to 154.50 yen before
resuming its climb.
   The rebound in prices on the stock exchange after three months
of almost continual decline was directly linked to the yen's surge
against the dollar, traders said.
   The Nikkei average has declined over 20 percent, or 8,517.94
points, since the end of last year.
   Kozo Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co. attributed
the index's surge today to a G-7 statement that stressed the
importance of the yen's stability, which he said reassured stock
investors.
   ``The index's increase slowed down in the afternoon when some
market players sold issues for profit-taking, but as a whole, their
buying incentive was strong throughout the day,'' he said.
   Many investors believe the market bottomed out last week when
the Nikkei fell briefly below the 28,000-point level, he added.
   An estimated 800 million shares changed hands in one of the most
active trading days in recent weeks.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bond closed at 86.73 points, up from Friday's close of
86.38, as bond investors were reassured by the yen's strength
against the dollar. The No. 199's yield fell to 7.205 percent from
7.275 percent on Friday.
   Meanwhile, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news
conference today that the yen's weakness was due to speculation and
that speculative pressure in th market would be met by coordinated
G-7 action.
   He enphasized that the Paris G-7 meeting was the first in which
the yen was specificaly mentioned in the communique.
   Mieno stressed that the G-7 nations would take appropriate and
timely measures in accordance with the communique, and said he
hopes the market would interpret the G-7 statement in that light.
   He said there is no reason for the yen to weaken considering the
strength of Japan's economic fundamentals.

<HEAD>Two More Bodies Push Fire Toll to Six; Eight Still Missing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators picked through the
charred remains of a residential hotel, looking for more bodies as
the death toll in the fire rose to six.
   Searchers using dogs and heavy equipment continued sifting
debris in the charred hulk of the 39-year-old Fontana Hotel today
after finding the fifth and sixth bodies Sunday.
   The number of guests unaccounted for after the fast-moving fire
swept through the 102-room hotel Friday dropped to eight.
   More than a score of federal, state, city and county agency
officials began their search at the top and along the sides of the
gutted building.
   ``Our main concern now is to get the bodies out, but safely so
that we don't risk the teams,'' said Miami Beach Police Detective
Jim Hyde, spokesman for the search effort.
   The fifth body was unidentifiable even as to gender. It was
found Sunday morning when a bulldozer pushed aside some debris,
Hyde said.
   At midafternoon, the sixth body, that of a woman, was found in
the rear of the blackened remnants of the hotel.
   The fourth body, discovered Saturday, remained in the building
throughout the weekend. Dr. Joseph Davis, chief medical examiner
for Dade County, said searchers couldn't immediately get to it
because of dangerous debris.
   A bathtub and a roof-top tank dangled above the spot where that
body was found, and a weakened wall remained standing nearby, he
said.
   Only one of the six victims, Dr. Joseph Wels, 92, has been
identified. Davis said all bodies still in the hotel would
eventually be found.
   About 100 people, many of them elderly retirees, were seasonal
or year-round residents at the Fontana. Survivors had to grope down
dark, smoky hallways or jump out windows to flee the fire.
   The Fontana complied with current fire regulations, according to
city officials, and was equipped with smoke detectors in each room.
   But the hotel did not have sprinklers, which are required by law
only beginning in 1991.
   Besides the death toll, 21 hotel residents were taken to three
area hospitals Friday for treatment, and five remained hospitalized
in good condition over the weekend.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was lower against other major
currencies in calm trading in Europe this morning, as the market
assessed the possible impact of the weekend meeting of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations.
   Gold prices rose slightly.
   The dollar wasn't showing much reaction to reports that a number
of European central banks stepped into the market to sell dollars
for yen, dealers said.
   The yen failed to rally convincingly because the market doesn't
believe the G-7 is committed to supporting the currency, dealers
said.
   The finance ministers of Britain, Canada, France, West Germany,
Italy, Japan and the United States agreed at their meeting in Paris
on Saturday that the yen's recent downswing could have
``undesirable consequences.''
   But they only said they would keep developments under review.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.02 yen to a closing 156.45 yen Monday. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 156.98 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6914 West German marks, down from 1.6941
   _1.4951 Swiss francs, down from 1.4992
   _5.6803 French francs, down from 5.6942
   _1.9043 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9070
   _1,242.50 Italian lire, down from 1,245.50
   _1.1635 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1652
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6395, compared with $1.6385 late Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $380.40 a troy ounce, up
from $378.00 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.85.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $378.75, up from $378.00 late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.92 to close at a bid $379.13.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.16 a troy ounce from
Friday's $5.13.

   A fire early today on an
Ireland-bound car ferry killed one person, left 25 injured and
appeared to be arson, the vessel's owners said. Passengers reported
crawling through thick smoke to safety.
   The fire started in two sleeping cabins in an unoccupied section
of the ferry Norrona, which was carrying 297 people from Wales,
Dublin, Ireland-based B and I shipping line said in a statement.
   It did not elaborate, but the company's marine superintendent,
Capt. Peter McKenna, told Irish Radio that B and I was ``fairly
certain about this.'' He said the company believes mattresses or
lighted paper were used to start the fire. Police were interviewing
all those on board.
   The ferry was eight miles off the Welsh coast en route from
Milford Haven, 180 miles west of London, to Rosslare, Ireland, when
the fire was discovered. Firefighters and crew members controlled
the blaze within two hours of the captain's Mayday call, said coast
guard spokesman George Clarke.
   Survivors described crawling through thick smoke that choked
corridors and cabins, 10 of which were damaged.
   ``I took the skin off my knees and toes but, thank God, we got
out alive,'' said Fred Jenkinson, who was asleep in his cabin when
he heard shouts and smelled smoke.
   ``I am sure the terrible fire on the Scandinavian Star at the
weekend was going through a lot of people's minds. Suddenly, we all
seemed to be in a similar situation.''
   About 150 people aboard the Scandinavian Star ferry were killed
when fire broke out Saturday as the ship sailed in the North Sea on
an overnight trip from Norway to Denmark. Investigators said they
suspected arson.
   ``We were in the cabin when we heard a shout and the whole place
was filled with smoke. It was quite frightening. But there was
absolutely no panic,'' said Olive Leader, who was traveling with
her sister and children.
   Another passenger, Delia Reynolds, said she heard screaming but
no alarms.
   ``Crew members were busy going around saying `Everyone up on
deck, go up on deck.' The smoke was awful but there was no panic,''
Mrs. Reynolds said.
   A team of B and I engineers boarded the ferry to assess the
damage.
   The coast guard at Milford Haven, Wales, said the person killed
in the fire had not been identified but a Royal Air Force spokesman
said it was a crew member.
   Nine of the injured were airlifted from the ferry by two RAF
helicopters and one Royal Navy helicopter, which also brought
firefighters and two doctors to the vessel, Clarke said.
   Other casualties from among the 219 passengers and 78 crew
members were taken to the hospital by ambulance when the vessel
returned to the dock at Milford Haven under its own power.
   The injured were treated for smoke inhalation, cuts and bruises,
said an unidentified spokeswoman at Withybush Hospital in
Haverfordwest. One woman was transferred to the intensive care unit
at another hospital, she said.

   Police arrested the alleged deputy
chief of staff of the Communist rebel army today as he returned to
the country from Europe, officials and state television reported.
   Antonio Cabardo, alleged deputy chief of staff of the New
People's Army, was taken into custody about noon at Ninoy Aquino
International Airport, said Col. Victor Tiangco, operations chief
of the Capital Command.
   The government television station reported that Cabardo came
from Europe with a stopover in Hong Kong but did not say which
European country he had visited.
   As deputy chief of staff, Cabardo is believed to be the
second-ranking figure in the 20,000-member New People's Army, which
has been waging a 21-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state.
   Cabardo is believed to be a member of the political bureau of
the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines.
   The rebel chief of staff, Romulo Kintanar, escaped from prison
in November 1988 after slipping away from a birthday party for a
former jailer.
   The military had offered a 500,000 peso ($23,800) reward for his
capture.
   Cabardo was the most senior party official to be apprehended
since July, when suspected political bureau member Saturnino Ocampo
and his wife were arrested in Manila.

<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Israeli soldiers have testified
that they were told army orders to break the bones of Palestinian
detainees came from the upper echelons of the military.
   The soldiers _ reserve Sgts. Guy Neeman, Amiram Avirosh and
Ronen Ferber _ were called as defense witnesses in the court
martial of Col. Yehuda Meir, the former commander of Israeli troops
in the Nablus area of the West Bank.
   Meir, 38, who left the army last year, is charged with ordering
soldiers to break the limbs of Palestinians taken into custody in
the West Bank villages of Beita and Hawwara in January 1988. The
trial began last month.
   Col. Menashe Finkelstein, the army's chief prosecutor, suggested
in cross-examination that orders to break bones originated from
officers in the field. But last month, Meir was quoted by the
Hadashot newspaper as suggesting the orders originated from someone
with a higher military rank.
   ``The entire leadership of the Israeli defense forces from the
defense minister through the chief of staff and other commanders
... will have to answer questions they may wish to silence,'' he
was quoted as saying.
   At the third session of his trial, Meir sat impassively, often
smiling to himself, as the three soldiers detailed the brutal
actions in Beita on Jan. 19 and in Hawarra two days later.
   According to Avirosh, the Beita incident began when soldiers
went to investigate a firebomb attack. He said Meir appealed to
village leaders for calm, but gangs of youths blocked the roads and
hurled stones.
   He said the soldiers rounded up 12 Arabs who were handcuffed and
in some cases blindfolded, put on a bus and driven out of town.
After several miles they were ordered off and ``beaten very
badly,'' he said.
   He said the company commander, identified only as Eldad, told
the soldiers after the incident, ``it was not easy for him to give
us this order.''
   Avirosh recalled Eldad said ``it was immoral, but the order came
from high up, I think he said from the defense minister.''
   Avirosh referred to Yitzhak Rabin, who resigned as defense
minister last month when the Labor Party pulled out of the ruling
coalition and brought down the government.
   On Jan. 19, 1988 Rabin told a news conference the army had
orders to quell riots with ``force, power and blows.'' He has
denied he authorized soldiers to break prisoners' bones.
   Rabin's spokesman, Eitan Haber, said Rabin gave permission only
to beat demonstrators during pursuit.
   ``He never said that we should break bones,'' Haber said. ``To
beat, to hit, but not to break. He never said break.''
   Ferber said the next day the company commander told the
unit:``we are going someplace for an unusual action for the purpose
of breaking arms and legs.
   ``He said this was part of a new iron-fist policy and these were
not his orders but came from further up. I felt that he himself was
unhappy with them.''
   According to the testimony, the village leader in Hawwara
rounded up Palestinians wanted by the army. Then, enroute to the
detention center, the detainees were taken from the bus and beaten
with sticks and rifle.
   Afterward, Ferber said Eldad told the soldiers ``all the other
methods that were tried before hadn't worked so we thought that
breaking arms and legs would be a longer-lasting deterrent.''
   The next day, the unit was told the policy had been nullified.

   Tens of thousands of Soviet Georgians
rallied in Tbilisi today on the anniversary of the slaying of 19
pro-independence protesters by Soviet forces, and burned the
region's military chief in effigy.
   There was a partial re-enactment of last year's 4 a.m. assault,
when troops armed with shotguns, shovels and toxic gas charged onto
Rustaveli Boulevard in the Georgian capital.
   Radio stations broadcast the sound of rumbling tanks and ringing
bells.
   From midnight Sunday through early today, people carrying
flowers and candles thronged the boulevard. About 100,000 Georgians
stood with raised fists for a silent moment to honor the dead.
   Later, demonstrators burned an effigy of Col. Gen. I.N.
Rodionov, regional military commander, in front of the city's
Government House, which overlooks the broad square where Soviet
troops moved in.
   Nineteen people died in the clash a year ago, and another was
killed by troops in a separate incident. Thousands suffered
ailments from the gas.
   The assault caused a nationwide furor, raised doubts about
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's proclaimed policy of not using
troops to stifle dissent, and brought many Georgians into the
battle for independence.
   The memorial protest on Sunday and today had more an air of
defiance than mourning. Most speakers spoke of the impetus the
deaths gave the republic's burgeoning independence movement.
   ``This is a day of great sorrow, but also a day of great
victory,'' said Zviad Gamsakhurdia. ``On this day, the Georgian
soul was revived.''
   ``April 9 was the beginning of the national, democratic
revolution of Georgia, which is continuing,'' said Gamsakhurdia,
the dean of Georgian dissidents.
   Demonstrations were planned for later today in front of the
regional military headquarters and at the central stadium.
   In Leningrad on Sunday, about 30,000 people gathered on historic
Palace Square to mark the anniversary, journalist Maxim Korzlov
said. He said the crowd lit candles and stood in silence.
   The square is the site of the 1905 ``Bloody Sunday'' incident in
which czarist forces fired on a crowd of demonstrators.
   ``Today we recall the event of another Bloody Sunday, taking
place a year ago on the ninth of April,'' Anatoly Sobchak, a
national legislator, told the demonstrators.
   Gorbachev offered condolences Sunday, expressing his ``respect
for Georgia and its industrious people who are distinguished for
their glorious traditions, original culture and friendliness.''
   But Georgian activists dismissed the gesture.
   ``I believe he's sorry for people but he can't be sincere on the
government level because after Tbilisi came Baku,'' said a member
of the Georgian People's Front, a new moderate political group. He
did not give his name.
   Anti-Armenian riots broke out in Baku on Jan. 13 and Soviet
troops stormed the city a week later. By official count, about 200
people were killed.
   Red-white-and-black Georgian flags flew from many Tbilisi
buildings on Sunday, and women and children, some wearing black
headbands, placed red carnations and other flowers on the steps
before the arches of Government House.
   The steps glowed with the tiny flames of memorial candles and
church bells rang. Banners held by protesters read, ``Better to Die
in the Battle for Freedom Than to Live as a Slave,'' and ``Down
with the Occupiers.''
   Gamsakhurdia estimated that before April 9, 1989, only a small
minority of Georgians favored full independence from Moscow. Now,
he believes 90 percent of the people are on his side.
   Pro-independence politicians in Georgia, a Caucasus republic of
5 million, have scored major victories in recent weeks. On March 9,
the Georgian Parliament condemned Georgia's forced annexation by
the Soviet Union and demanded negotiations on the restoration of
independence.
   Later last month, Georgian radicals persuaded lawmakers to put
off local elections, thus giving newly legalized opposition parties
time to gain support.
   But the opposition movement appears badly splintered. A rift
exists between those who favor a Baltic-style parliamentary fight,
and extremists who want mass civil disobedience and boycotts of
state elections and the Soviet draft.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Nepalese paraded
through Katmandu in a delirium of joy today, chanting ``Victory,
Victory'' as this mountain monarchy celebrated the establishment of
a multiparty system.
   In a stunning announcement late Sunday, just two days after
police shot and killed as many as 200 pro-democracy protesters,
King Birendra lifted a 29-year ban on political parties.
   The city sprang to life early today after a two-day curfew was
lifted, but doctors said security forces had opened fire on
celebrants Sunday night. Relatives of a man and a 12-year-old boy
said the two were shot and killed.
   Doctors at Bir Hospital said five other people were being
treated for bullet wounds. The people who took the casualties to
the hospital reported at least 10 other people were killed and
their bodies taken away by the troops, the doctors said on
condition of anonymity.
   The reports could not be confirmed. Police denied there was any
firing.
   The 7-week-old pro-democracy campaign snowballed last week as
strikes spread and more people took to the streets. On Friday,
police opened fire on a crowd of more than 200,000 people marching
toward the royal palace.
   Witnesses said as many as 200 people were killed but the
government said only 10 people died and 107 were wounded. It was
Nepal's worst bloodshed in more than a century.
   Today, hundreds of processions by foot, cars and motor-powered
rickshaws wound through the capital's main streets.
   ``Today we will celebrate our freedom. We have no definite plan,
but we only want to express our joy,'' said Yagya Nidhi Duhal, his
face smeared with red powder used by Nepalese during celebrations.
   Most other processionists, including several Western tourists,
sported the powder mark on their foreheads.
   Hundreds of troops who had been patrolling Katmandu and its
suburbs assembled in a central park today preparing to return to
barracks. Dozens of armored personnel carriers were withdrawn
overnight.
   Revelries started shortly before midnight Sunday, when King
Birendra's proclamation was announced on state television and radio.
   The movement for greater democracy was launched Feb. 18 by the
Nepali Congress Party and the United Left Front, a coalition of
left-wing parties.
   Early today, marchers carried the red and white flags of the
Nepali Congress, hugged each other and shouted: ``Panchayat thieves
go back. Hang the Panchayat,'' referring to the partyless national
assembly, the Rashtriya Panchayat.
   ``When I was born 30 years ago, I could not breathe. Today I am
like a free bird. I am so happy I want to fly,'' schoolteacher
Nagendra Amatya said at Bir Hospital, where he had gone to meet the
top Nepali Congress leader, Ganesh Man Singh.
   Singh, who had led the movement from his hospital bed for the
past week, walked out of his room today for the first time to greet
people. He had been under house arrest before being taken to the
hospital for treatment of arthritis and a urinary infection.
   ``Our responsiblity has increased. The struggle for democracy
was difficult, but it will be more difficult to maintain the
democracy,'' the 75-year-old Singh said as he slowly walked out of
his ward, aided by a stout stick and two associates.
   Foreign Minister Pashupati Rani said Sunday that elections for
the yet-undissolved national assembly would be held soon, but gave
no date.
   For 50 days, hundreds of thousands of people had taken part in
demonstrations for a new political system in Nepal, where the
monarchy wielded almost absolute power.
   There had been demonstrations in the past, but support was
limited to students and a small circle of political agitators. The
current campaign drew doctors, lawyers and teachers who went on
strike.
   Then, the pilots of Royal Air Nepal walked off their jobs,
followed by staffers in several state-run banks and even government
ministries.
   Before police opened fire on demonstrators Friday, at least 16
people were killed in the ballooning movement.
   But Friday's bloodshed jolted the normally tranquil country,
where the largely illiterate peasantry had revered the monarch as a
reincarnation of the Hindu god Shiva. Not since 1846, when feuding
members of the royal household battled had Nepal seen such
bloodshed.
   Birendra, 44, is the heir of the Shaha dynasty that has held the
throne since the middle of the 18th century.
   The kingdom's only previous experiment with Western-style
democracy lasted less than two years and came to a halt in 1961
when Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed the Nepali
Congress government, accusing it of corruption and inefficiency.
   Until Sunday, political parties had been banned and the king had
ruled with the rubber stamp National Assembly. Birendra selected
one-fifth of the assembly's members. The rest were elected on a
nonparty basis, but political observers said all candidates were
approved by the palace.

<TEXT>
   The knock at the door was supposed to
be the delivery man bringing more beer to a party at the Manila
city jail. Instead, 15 rebel soldiers burst in and freed Lt. Col.
Billy Bibit.
   Sunday's escape by Bibit, jailed on charges of trying to
overthrow the government for his alleged role in the Dec. 1-9
failed coup, was just the latest example of prisoners taking
advantage of lax security to win freedom.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered a nationwide manhunt for Bibit.
A presidential spokeswoman, Lourdes Sytangco, described Mrs. Aquino
as ``angry'' and promised: ``We will be seeing more forceful action
in this case.''
   The Manila city jail superintendent was relieved and three
jailers, including a deputy warden, were arrested for negligence
after Sunday's escape.
   And today, an air force captain held for trying to overthrow the
government escaped, eluding guards at Villamor Air Base, sources
said on condition of anonymity. Capt. Rogelio Seradoy had during a
failed August 1987 coup piloted the helicopter in which coup leader
Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan escaped.
   In the Philippines, ``great escapes'' are better described as
``great escapades.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa admitted recently
that he was displeased with security at jails and stockades
nationwide.
   But de Villa said it was difficult to enforce strict security
because Filipino culture frowns on rules which prohibit conjugal
visits, fraternization between guards and inmates and liberal
furloughs to attend funerals, graduations and other family
occasions.
   Police said Bibit escaped after guards, inmates and women
visitors gathered and drank beer to celebrate the birthday of the
deputy warden, Maj. Manuel Roxas.
   In November 1988, the chief of the Communist rebel army, Romulo
Kintanar, slipped away from a birthday celebration for a former
jailer and resumed command of the New People's Army.
   The fact that such an important prisoner was allowed out of his
cell, albeit under guard, was suprising considering the flap
surrounding Honasan's escape six months earlier.
   Honasan had been held aboard a prison ship in Manila Bay because
he led the August 1987 attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino. Despite
assurances Honasan had been neutralized, the charismatic officer
convinced sailors to help him escape in April 1988.
   He remains at large and is believed to have played a major role
in the failed December coup, which claimed the lives of at least
113 people and left more than 600 injured.
   Another alleged conspirator, Lt. Col. Eduardo Matillano, slipped
away in 1988 when he was allowed to leave a stockade to visit a
dentist. Matillano was arrested a few months later when waiters
spotted him dining with a well-known pornographic movie star.
   Sometimes, prisoners have been allowed to leave jails by corrupt
guards to commit crimes. In 1987, a suspect was arrested after
witnesses identified him as one of the killers of Local Governments
Secretary Jaime Ferrer.
   It turned out the suspect was supposed to have been in the
national prison serving a life sentence for murder. He had been
released a few days before Ferrer's murder to testify in a trial.
   A judge and the warden were later fired after investigators
learned there was no trial and the release order was bogus.
   Such practices are not unique to the Aquino administration. In
May 1985, during the late President Ferdinand Marcos' term, a
senior Communist leader, Saturnino Ocampo, was allowed to leave
prison to vote in the National Press Club elections.
   Ocampo, a former journalist, slipped away from his guards. He
was arrested last July. Ironically, he had been living less than a
block from the police headquarters in suburban Makati.

<HEAD>Union Voting on Latest Offer By Kaiser</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of workers at Kaiser Permanente
hospitals and medical centers were voting today on a new contract
offer that could end a week-old strike at the nation's largest
health maintenance organization.
   Seven Kaiser hospitals and more than 40 clinics were affected by
the walkout by about 11,000 members of Service Workers
International Union Local 399.
   The strike began April 2, two days after just over 4,500 of the
affected workers voted to reject a $44 million, three-year offer
from Kaiser.
   That offer guaranteed a 5 percent across-the-board raise the
first year and 3 percent raises during subsequent years.
   Workers demanded higher wages, but did not reveal how much they
wanted. Top pay for a licensed vocational nurse under the old
contract was $13.01 per hour, Kaiser said.
   Union officials have said employees stood by Kaiser and accepted
a wage freeze three years ago when the company was having financial
problems. Now, they say, Kaiser is back on its feet and its workers
should recoup as well.
   Kaiser Permanente of Southern California has more than 2 million
members, about 1.5 million of whom live in Los Angeles, Orange and
Ventura counties, the areas affected by the strike.
   Hospitals in Anaheim, Los Angeles, West Los Angeles, Panorama
City, Woodland Hills, Harbor City, Bellflower and more than 40
satellite medical offices were affected by the walkout.
   Kaiser cut back some services and reduced patient populations as
managers and workers from non-affected facilities filled in.

<HEAD>Richards, Mattox Race to Finish in Texas Gubernatorial Runoff</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial rivals Ann Richards and
Jim Mattox raced to finish their bruising runoff campaign with
stops in a dozen cities today.
   The candidates visited inner-city churches and campaigned in
Hispanic communities Sunday, continuing to trade barbs but
promising to make peace after Tuesday's election.
   The winner will take on Republican nominee Clayton Williams in
the November election.
   Mattox, the state attorney general, accused Ms. Richards on
Sunday of being treated for cocaine addiction 10 years ago, the
latest and strongest in a series of drug-use allegations that have
dominated the runoff campaign.
   ``I'm saying that she used cocaine at the age of 46 and
marijuana, and she used other drugs,'' Mattox said in an interview
broadcast on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.'' The attorney general
said he obtained the information from mutual friends he declined to
identify.
   Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, phoned the program to deny
she'd ever sought treatment for cocaine use, but declined to appear
on the show.
   She dismissed the charge Saturday, when word of the pre-taped
interview reached her while campaigning in Henderson. ``Jimmy's
just going nuts,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Last week, three people claimed they saw Mattox smoke marijuana
on separate occasions in the 1970s. Mattox denied the accusations.
   Ms. Richards has answered questions about illegal drug use by
saying she has not used a ``mood-altering'' drug in 10 years.
   A poll published Sunday showed Ms. Richards and Mattox virtually
deadlocked.
   Both candidates planned last-minute campaign swings through
Texas.
   Ms. Richards was scheduled to stump in Arlington, Longview,
Midland, San Antonio and Waco today. Mattox was spending the day
before the election in Beaumont, Dallas, Hurst, Longview, Lufkin,
Texarkana and Tyler.
   The candidates have apologized in recent days for the negative
tone of the campaign and said the Democrats would unite to face
Williams.
   ``We've had a family squabble. I think the family will come back
together again because there's more of us in the family than
outside the family,'' Mattox said in Houston.
   But he said, ``Deep down in my heart, I don't think Ann Richards
should be governor of Texas.
   ``I believe her candidacy is a reflection of a social phenomenon
that is taking place and it doesn't have anything to do with her
ability to really make decisions.''
   Mattox said the social phenomenon he meant was ``the demanding
the election of a woman governor.''
   Ms. Richards said she would mend fences with Mattox and expect
his help if she becomes the Democratic nominee. She said, however,
Mattox probably wouldn't have a place in her administration.
   ``His style of management and operation is not something I
want,'' Ms. Richards said in Dallas.
   A poll published Sunday by the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas
Morning News showed Ms. Richards and Mattox in a tight race.
   Of 759 Democrats who said they'd vote in the runoff, 44 percent
backed Ms. Richards and 38 percent Mattox, and 16 percent said they
were undecided, according to the poll. The telephone survey by the
University of Houston had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.

   A land mine hidden in a
culvert exploded under a military vehicle today, killing four
soldiers and injuring a civilian near this southeastern town,
police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a statement
issued to news media in the British province.
   An army spokesman said the bomb hurled the heavily Land Rover
into the air and left behind a huge crater in the road about 40
feet wide and 15 feet deep. Shattered pieces of the vehicle
scattered the nearby countryside.
   The explosion occurred just before 8 a.m. near the Downpatrick
race course in County Down, in the southeast part of the province.
The area was quickly sealed off and police and soldiers were
airlifted in to search for clues.
   A civilian in a passing car suffered cuts and bruises, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   The soldiers were members of the Ulster Defense Regiment, the
mainly Protestant, locally recruited regiment of the British army,
said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, the British government
minister responsible for the province, said ``actions of this sort
are wholly senseless in that they will not deflect us from our
intention to defend the community against these evil men.''
   The deaths bring to 16 killed in political and sectarian
violence in Northern Ireland so far this year.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

officials said.
   The three were found in a second-floor bedroom of a two-story

No one else was hurt.
   The victims were apparently trying to get out of the house when
they were overcome by smoke, Flynn said. He said the fire had
started in a chair on the first floor of the home, and was
apparently lit by a cigarette. Fire officials believe a smoke alarm
sounded, but the victims were trapped by the flames and unable to

   Of 14 fire fatalities in Baltimore so far this year, 12 have

   Here is a look at the outcome of elections held Sunday in
several countries.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERU:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa won the most votes for president but
a politically independent agronomist, Alberto Fujimori, surged
ahead of other candidates and forced a runoff.
   Unofficial returns show Vargas Llosa, an champion of free market
reforms and economic shock therapy, leading with 33.9 percent of
the vote _ far short of the 50 percent required to avoid a runoff.
   Soldiers protect polling stations in the economically-troubled
Andean nation, but guerrillas of the 10-year-old leftist Shining
Path stage attacks. Dynamite is hurled at several polling stations,
but no injuries are reported.
   Fujimori, the 51-year-old son of Japanese immigrants, garnered
29 percent of the vote. Luis Alva Castro of the center-left
governing Aprista Party won just 16.4 percent. A few weeks ago, he
held a solid second in the polls.
   Independent pollsters give Fujimori a better-than-even chance of
defeating Vargas Llosa in the second round of voting, expected in
late May or early June.

<HEAD>GREECE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the country's third parliamentary elections in 10 months, the
conservative New Democratic party won 150 of Parliament's 300
seats, falling one seat short of the majority needed to govern
alone.
   New Democrat leader Constantine Mitsotakis says he'll
nevertheless try to form a government. Lacking an outright
majority, however, it was not clear if he would have to turn to a
smaller party or an independent in his bid to become premier.
   A victory by the New Democrats, who fell just short of a
majority in inconclusive June and November elections, would end a
debilitating political deadlock that has left Greece unable to cope
with a crumbling economy and growing urban terrorism.
   The conservatives last held power in 1981, when they lost in a
landslide to the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) of former
Premier Andreas Papandreou. Both PASOK and the conservatives have
governed Greece since the military dictatorship ended in 1974.

<HEAD>HUNGARY:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In balloting that ended four decades of Communist rule, the
conservative and nationalistic Democratic Forum won a resounding
victory over its liberal rival but fell short of a majority.
   Unofficial results show the party to have won 165 of 386 seats
at stake in Sunday's runoff and first-round balloting two weeks
ago. The liberal League of Free Democrats collected 92 seats.
   The agrarian Smallholders took 43 seats and the Christian
Democrats won 21. The two parties are considered likely coalition
partners, largely sharing the Democratic Forum's emphasis on family
and Hungarian tradition.
   It is the second victory for a conservative party in free
elections in the former Soviet bloc. Conservatives won big in East
Germany's March 18 vote, falling just short of a majority. In both
countries, the remnants of the long-ruling Communists were
relegated to a relatively minor opposition role.
   The Socialist Party, comprised of Communist reformers who nearly
two years ago initiated the democratic changes in Hungary, won 33
seats.

<HEAD>YUGOSLAVIA:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The liberal republic of Slovenia held Yugoslavia's first free
multiparty elections since 1945, with the presidential candidate
who favored a cautious approach to secession winning the most votes.
   But former Communist Milan Kucan did not gain an absolute
majority and faces an April 22 runoff vote with Joze Pucnik, a
former political prisoner who advocates quick Slovenian
independence from Yugoslavia.
   Early returns from Sunday's balloting indicated the Slovenian
Communists, who recently followed an East European trend and
renamed themselves, would be the largest single party in the
republic's Parliament but would face a tough five-party
conservative coalition led by Pucnik.
   The former Communists have broken with the national Communist
Party leadership because it has resisted democratic reform.
   Slovenians have shown an increased desire to secede from the
loose and ethnically diverse Yugoslav federation because they are
unhappy with resistance to reform in much of the rest of the
country, especially Serbia.
   Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, is a bastion of
centralized control where the leaders demand continued Communist
Party dominance.

<TEXT>
   In a speech to a six-nation
conference on Central Europe today, President Vaclav Havel proposed
creation of a new security commission that would gradually replace
NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   ``It is impossible to return to the Europe of the past'' and
therefore a timetable should be agreed to shape the Europe of the
future, Havel said in outlining his prescription for curbing the
continent's historic conflicts.
   The dissident playwright turned president suggested the
Bratislava conference find ways to ``build a solid wall against all
expressions of nationalism and chauvinism,'' said his spokesman,
Michael Zantovsky.
   The unique day-long meeting gathered representatives of Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, with Austria, Italy and Hungary
attending as observers. It seemed unlikely to reach any decisions
on its broad agenda, partly because Hungary was represented by
officials of the reformed Communist leadership that was soundly
defeated in Sunday's free elections.
   Jozsef Antall, the leader of the victorious Hungarian Democratic
Forum and the likely new premier of Hungary, was invited but sent
the party's vice president, Ferenc Kulin, Hungarian officials said.
   Outlining 10 questions to the closed-door meeting, Havel invited
consideration of a proposal to create a new all-European Security
Commission this year, Zantovsky told reporters.
   The idea was first outlined by Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier
at a Warsaw Pact meeting in Prague on March 17, when the
Czechoslovaks said it drew a mixed response, the coolest reaction
coming from the Soviets.
   Both superpowers have reacted somewhat coldly to the insistence
by Havel and Dienstbier that Europe's military blocs are outdated
and should be disbanded.
   Czechoslovakia wants to use the 35-nation Helsinki process,
involving the United States, Canada and all European nations except
Albania, as the basis for the new Security Commission, and for new
agreements to preserve peace on the world's most heavily armed
continent.
   Havel, who called today's conference for Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to ponder cooperation in their ``return to Europe,''
proposed the three pool efforts to join the 12-nation European
Economic Community.
   He also said they should take a joint stand on the Warsaw Pact
and Soviet economic bloc, Comecon.
   All three countries are emerging from more than four decades of
Soviet domination and Communist rule. Uniting could help them
combat the influence likely to be wielded by a united Germany.
   However, such cooperation could be marred both by conflicting
interests such as those of debt-ridden Poland and relatively
wealthy Czechoslovakia, and by the ethnic conflicts that have
clouded Eastern Europe's democratic reforms.
   Those conflicts could threaten European peace, as they did
between the two World Wars and for centuries before.
   Eastern Europe's worst ethnic conflict currently is the tension
between the Hungarian minority and Romanians in Transylvania, where
an explosion of strife last month left at least six people dead in
Tirgu Mures.
   The victory of the center-right Democratic Forum in Sunday's
Hungarian elections is likely also to keep the fate of the
Hungarian minorities in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia high
on Budapest's diplomatic agenda.
   The outgoing Socialist government in Hungary already has asked
Prague to improve the rights of the 500,000 Hungarians living in
Slovakia. Foreign Ministry sources suggested demands for
Hungarian-language schools would be granted if matched by similar
rights for the tiny Slovak minority in Hungary.
   In pushing their agenda for a new Europe, Havel and Dienstbier
have been able to draw on their years-long contacts with former
Solidarity activists now wielding power in Poland, and to a lesser
extent on ties to one-time dissidents in Hungary.

<HEAD>High-Ho? Neighbors Criticize Disney's Towering Dwarfs</HEAD>

   Many residents of the sleepy
neighborhoods near the Walt Disney Co. are grumpy about towering
additions to the firm's new headquarters, and they're not bashful
about saying so.
   ``Obviously Disney always does things their own way, with a
flair for the dramatic,'' said Jeff Vander Borght, a Burbank
planning board member. ``But I'm afraid it's totally out of scale
for the neighborhood.''
   This week, a huge veil comes down at the new corporate
headquarters to reveal 19-foot tall renderings of Happy, Grumpy,
Sleepy, Sneezy, Dopey, Bashful and Doc perched on the third story.
The statues appear to hold up the fifth-story roof.
   Alan Epstein, vice president of Disney Development Corp., and
Burbank's city planner, Rick Pruetz, said the building conforms
strictly to city codes, so no public hearings were held on the
design.
   That's a pity, said Vander Borght, an architect who lives nearby.
   ``It gives a whole new meaning to the word dwarf,'' he said.
``Stretch dwarfs. We're going to be known as the city of the huge
dwarfs.''
   Abutting the sprawling Burbank lot on two sides are quiet
residential neighborhoods, where neat bungalows sit on tree-lined
streets. Yards sport neatly trimmed hedges, barbecue grills and
pools.
   Founder Walt Disney allowed no identification of the company on
the studio property. The studio gate carried only a small plaque
identifying the nature of the enterprise inside.
   ``Walt didn't want tourists popping in to interfere with
production,'' said a longtime employee, who asked not to be
identified. ``And he didn't want people mistakenly believing that
Disneyland was in Burbank.''
   However, Michael Eisner changed all that when he became Disney
chairman in 1984. Now the studio lot's huge water tower sports a
picture of Mickey Mouse and soon the dwarfs _ characters from
Disney's 1937 animated classic, ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''
_ will peer down on those who enter the executive offices.

   Police investigators today breached the
blackened interior of the Scandinavia Star ferry and found
children's bodies, raising the estimated death toll from a weekend
fire to 170, a spokesman said.
   The suspicious blaze, which broke out early Saturday while the
ship was traveling from Norway to Denmark with at least 500 aboard,
was extinguished Sunday night, officials said.
   A team of officers today entered cabins previously blocked by
fire and searing heat, said Police Inspector Lief Skoglund.
   ``When they went inside the boat they saw lots and lots of dead
bodies, maybe 100 more,'' said Skoglund. ``There may 170 dead on
board,'' he said, making clear that it was rough estimate.
   Police earlier estimated the number of victims on the
20-year-old vessel at around 150 but said that did not count
children who would not appear on any passenger list.
   The remains of 75 victims were removed from the blackened shell
of the 470-foot Danish-owned ferry before the fire was
extinguished, Skoglund said.
   Police listed 345 survivors, but it was uncertain how many
people had been aboard when the fire broke out. The captain said
395 passengers and 97 crewmen were on board, leaving 147 people
dead or missing and presumed dead. But that figure did not include
children under age 7, said Onso.
   An accurate count of the victims was expected to take several
days.
   The ship caught fire before dawn Saturday on the North Sea
voyage from Oslo, Norway to Frederikshavn, Denmark.
   The captain of the ship denied improper behavior today, as
reports surfaced that he and his officers abandoned the burning
vessel as rescue efforts got under way.
   District police chief Roar Onso said a commission of officials
from Sweden, Norway and Denmark would investigate the disaster,
parallel to the police investigation focusing on suspicion of arson.
   ``We are working on the assumption that the fire was arranged,''
said Magnar Aukrust, assistant police chief in Oslo, Norway. ``In
that case, it is a real disaster, caused by one or several
persons,'' he said.
   Onso said Sunday that the investigation would probe all
possibilities to the case, including any connection to three
previous fires on North Sea ferries. But Onso said it was difficult
to see a link between the fires, which occurred on different routes
on ships from different companies.
   Another suspicious fire early today broke out on a ferry bound
from Wales to Ireland, killing one person and injuring 25, the
vessel's owners said. Passengers reported crawling through thick
smoke to safety.
   The fire started in two sleeping cabins in an unoccupied section
of the ferry Norrona, which was carrying 297 people, said a
statement by the Dublin, Ireland-based B and I shipping line.
Company officials blamed arson.
   Captain Hugo Larsen was on the bridge of the 10,500-ton ferry as
the smoldering ship was towed into harbor at dusk on Saturday. Fire
officials said he left the ship before all survivors were
evacuated, and returned later.
   ``I never failed the passengers,'' Larsen was quoted as saying
by Sweden's national TT news agency. ``It was only when the flames
were around the bridge and we didn't have a chance to go down to
look for more passengers on the deck that I gave the order to leave
the ship,'' Larsen was quoted as saying.
   Fire inspector Ingvar Brynfors, who was among the first rescuers
to reach the ship, said Larsen had moved to the Stena Saga, another
ferry that picked up survivors and helped coordinate rescue efforts.
   Larsen, speaking on Swedish radio, also denied that the alarm
failed to go off. ``The fire alarm sounded all over the boat,'' he
said.
   Passengers complained that the crewmen, mostly Filipinos and
Portuguese sailors, were untrained for emergencies and could not
communicate with them.
   Rick Qualls, an American member of a song-and-dance troupe that
worked on the ship, said the alarm was sounded 15 minutes after the
vessel caught fire and filled with smoke.
   In a week aboard the ship, he said, he had never undergone a
fire drill, though he praised the crew for trying to save lives.
   Firefighter Bjorn Ralbring told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper
that he was given to understand that everyone was safely evacuated
by the time he arrived _ 3{ hours after the distress signal was
sent. He said he was surprised to stumble over bodies.
   ``Behind every cabin door there were more dead people. There
were mothers who tried to protect their children with rags, older
couples were huddled together,'' he said.
   Onso said Sunday that the hunt for the cause of the fire would
begin in earnest as soon as all the bodies were taken out and the
ship cooled enough for investigators to work.
   One unconfirmed report carried by several newspapers said Larsen
was warned of possible arson 10 hours before the voyage.
   Police confirmed that at least two fires broke out independently
on separate decks within a few minutes of each other. Onso declined
to speculate on how that fit with claims by the ship'd Danish
owner, VR Da-No, that the fires were deliberately set.
   On Sept. 25, 1989 a fire started in a linen closet killed two
peple on the Tor Scandinavia west of the Danish coast. Police
suspected arson but failed to charge anyone.
   Arson was not suspected in the other fires aboard the King of
Scandinavia Feb. 18, 1989, in which five people were hospitalized,
and on the Stena Nordica 10 days later, in which no one was injured.

<HEAD>Non-Greyhound Bus Struck by Two Bullets In Fort Worth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Arrow Trailways bus was struck by
two bullets as it drove on a highway near downtown, the first
violence attributed to the Greyhound drivers strike in the city,
officials said.
   The bus, carrying 11 passengers from San Angelo to Dallas, was
hit about 10:30 p.m. Sunday, officials said.
   One bullet struck the passenger door near the front of the bus
and another hit just behind the door, police said.
   ``It sounds like the metal or glass stopped one from penetrating
or it would have hit the driver in the head,'' said Fort Worth
Police Sgt. Jon Grady. He said there are no suspects in the
incident.
   Arrow Trailways is not affiliated with Greyhound, but Greyhound
spokesman Kevin Fry in Dallas said police notified the company of
the incident.
   Killeen-based Arrow Trailways belongs to an association of bus
companies that uses the name of the former Trailways bus line,
which was taken over by Greyhound a few years ago. Arrow Trailways'
drivers are not on strike.
   Asked this morning why Greyhound was notified of the shooting if
the two companies are not affiliated, spokeswoman Liz Hale replied,
``Maybe somebody made a mistake.''
   There have been more than 30 incidents of shootings of buses
since Greyhound drivers went on strike March 2. The company has
said it won't negotiate with the strikers until a week passes
without strike-related violence.
   Elsewhere, a Greyhound replacement driver was charged Sunday
with carrying a dangerous weapon after he brandished a rifle during
a confrontation with striking bus workers in Washington, D.C.
   A Boston-bound Greyhound bus rear-ended a jeep Sunday on the
Massachusetts Turnpike after suffering apparent brake failure, the
state police said. No injuries were reported on the bus, but the
jeep's driver was taken to a hospital complaining of back pain.

   Although the Hungarian Socialists were unique among the late
Soviet bloc's ruling parties in implementing democratic reform
without massive popular pressure, they were voted out of power in
the first round. Many people associated the party with the excesses
of 43 years of Communist rule.
   The Communists consolidated power in 1948, a year after
Hungary's last multiparty elections, which were widely believed to
have been rigged.
   In Sunday's runoffs, 171 seats were directly elected, and 90

by tallying the votes for each party. In the first round 29 parties
competed but most did not garner enough votes to qualify for the

   One of the Siamese twins surgically
separated last week at the chest and abdomen has died, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   James Watkins died Sunday at 3:20 p.m. EDT, said Catherine
Coleman at All Children's Hospital. The cause of death was not
immediately being released, she said.
   Ms. Coleman said James' twin, Jakob, remained in critical but
stable condition.
   ``Right now, that's all the parents want released,'' she said.
``I don't know at what point his condition changed.''
   The twins were born Feb. 28 to Raquel and Scott Watkins of St.
Petersburg.
   Both James and Jakob were listed in critical but stable
condition after undergoing nearly 13 hours of separation surgery
April 3. Chief surgeon Richard Harmel said after the operation that
the main problem encountered by the operating team was dividing the
twins' only shared organ, the liver.
   Jakob emerged from the operation as the larger and more dominant
of the two boys, doctors said. Jakob was described as having more
healthy liver tissue, more tissue around his abdominal cavity and
more skin to cover the separation wound.
   Siamese twins occur about once every 100,000 births, with more
than half dying within the first 48 hours.

<HEAD>Andrew Lloyd Webber's `Aspects of Love' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 4 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   ``Intimate'' is not an adjective usually used in
describing the musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the man behind
``Cats,'' ``Evita,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``The Phantom of the
Opera.''
   But ``Aspects of Love,'' which opened Sunday at Broadway's
Broadhurst Theater, is a small Lloyd Webber musical that attempts
to spin several personal, paper-thin stories into a rueful
meditation on the wayward ways of love.
   Despite designer Maria Bjornson's stunning settings _ including
one breathtaking mountain panorama, ``Aspects of Love'' is really a
chamber piece, a showcase for what is Lloyd Webber's most unified
and complex work to date.
   The musical won't be the audience pleaser that his past megahits
have been. The tone is a little too rarified, and several of its
leading characters are decidedly unlikable. But the show represents
an important step forward for the composer in terms of musical
construction.
   ``Aspects of Love'' is based on a short, snobby and
sophisticated novel by David Garnett, a minor member of the
Bloomsbury group. In the book, Garnett chronicled the couplings _
and uncouplings _ of various arty types in the south of France.
   Lloyd Webber has updated the book a bit, setting his story
between the years 1947 and 1964. The protagonist is Alex
Dillingham, whose obsession with an older actress, Rose Vibert,
lasts those 17 years. His fascination with her transcends Rose's
marriage to his uncle George, her flirtation with an Italian
sculptress named Giulietta and even his infatuation with his niece,
Jenny, the daughter of Rose and George. Got that?
   There is enough bed-hopping and sexual longing to satisfy the
most ardent soap opera fan, but the Lloyd Webber music elevates the
story to something more. And Trevor Nunn's fluid direction makes
sure the show doesn't linger too long on the more precious
permutations of Garnett's plot.
   Musically, the show, which is sung through with almost no spoken
dialogue, mirrors the various aspects of love. There are soaring
melodies of budding romance like ``Love Changes Everything'' and
``Seeing is Believing''; wistful, melancholy remembrances like
``Other Pleasures'' and ``The First Man You Remember'';
``Falling,'' a quartet that neatly and quickly reveals the leading
characters' emotional states, and even an impassioned, terrifying
plea for companionship, ``Anything But Lonely.''
   The lyrics for ``Aspects of Love,'' like those written for ``The
Phantom of the Opera,'' are not as strong as the music.
Co-lyricists Don Black and Charles Hart have done a workmanlike
job, but they strike fire only once in a while.
   Still, there are some ravishing moments in the show when
everything comes together. The best occurs in the second act when
George fox trots with his daughter Jenny to the haunting ``The
First Man You Remember.'' It's an achingly beautiful scene, a
perfect blending of Lloyd Webber romanticism, the simplicity of the
lyrics by Black and Hart and Nunn's cinematic direction.
   The four leads are distinctive, able actors and fine singers
too. Particularly adept is the boyish Michael Ball, whose booming
tenor voice is just right for the overly eager Alex who turns into
a disillusioned middle-aged man before the curtain falls.
   Ann Crumb gives a perfect predatory performance as the
calculating Rose, and Kathleen Rowe McAllen is a sexy, wanton
Giulietta. Best of all is Kevin Colson as the world-weary,
pragmatic George, a man content with just ``A Memory of a Happy
Moment'' and whose motto is ``Life goes on, love goes free.''
   There also is fine support from Walter Charles as Marcel, Rose's
loyal stage manager, and Danielle DuClos as the vulnerable Jenny.
But in the end, the real star is Lloyd Webber, and his melodies are
as seductive as ever.

<TEXT>
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: Mr. Lloyd Webber continues to
compose in the official style that has made him an international
favorite, sacrificing any personality of his own to the
merchandisable common denominator of easy-listening pop music.
Though ``Aspects of Love'' purports to deal with romance in many
naughty guises ... it generates about as much heated passion as a
visit to the bank.
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: It never really explores the
complex material. It is rather a relentless, heartless attempt to
create another ``hit.''
   Clive Barnes, New York Post: The really fascinating aspect of
the new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ``Aspects of Love'' ... is what
a truly engrossing piece of music theater it all is. ..A
breakthrough piece for Lloyd Webber ...This is a great night for
love and lovers.

   Forecasters say the weather probably
will cooperate when the space shuttle Discovery takes off with
NASA's most valuable and eagerly awaited payload, the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``This project has been difficult. ... There are at least three
times when I thought we wouldn't do it,'' said Charles Pellerin
Jr., NASA's director of astrophysics. ``But we're there and it all
works and it's going to be great.''
   The launch is scheduled for 8:47 a.m. EDT on Tuesday.
   Pellerin inspected the telescope before the payload bay doors
were closed Sunday. He was pleased to note there was no evidence of
midges, tiny mosquitolike insects that had invaded a payload
preparation room at the launch pad two weeks ago.
   ``I can tell you there are no mosquitos visible, no midges, no
anything. We're extremely clean,'' he said. ``We're ready to go.''
   Later in the day, however, a short was detected in a heater
cable in a strut that connects the shuttle to its huge fuel tank.
The heater prevents ice from forming on the strut when the tank is
filled with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.
   Shuttle program director Robert L. Crippen said the problem was
not expected to delay the mission, which already is seven years
late because of technical problems and the 1986 Challenger
explosion.
   ``It's not a concern. We don't need it, and we're going to go
ahead and fly with it like it is,'' NASA test director Al Sofge
said today.
   Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver, and its
pilot, Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., practiced emergency
landings at the Kennedy Space Center on Sunday. They flew the
shuttle-training aircraft again today and were expected to review
their flight plans.
   Air Force weather forecasters were giving 50 percent odds for
favorable weather early Tuesday morning, with the main threat being
a low cloud ceiling caused by a warm front moving in from the
south. The odds were expected to improve later in the morning to 80
percent. The outlook worsened considerably if liftoff were delayed
a day.
   NASA may delay putting the astronauts inside the shuttle if it
appears the weather will prevent a prompt launch, Sofge said. The
space agency does not want the crew inside for more than 2{ hours
after the ``launch window'' opens at 8:47 a.m. to prevent fatigue.
   NASA can wait as long as about six hours, until midafternoon, to
launch Discovery.
   ``We start counting, and if we have to sit and wait, we'll sit
and wait'' before loading the astronauts, Sofge said.
   Discovery is to climb to an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a
shuttle has ever gone, in order to put the telescope into its
proper orbit.
   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will put the 24,250-pound
telescope into open space with the shuttle's 50-foot-long
mechanical arm on the second day of the five-day flight.
   Veteran spacewalkers Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan
will be standing by to step out of the shuttle cabin if a problem
develops.
   Discovery will trail the Hubble from 46 miles away for nearly
two days until the telescope's eight-foot mirror is exposed to
space.
   The telescope, named after the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble,
will be capable during its 15 years in orbit of detecting objects
50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best
ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their
light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years. The
universe is believed to have been formed about 15 billion years ago
by a tremendous explosion known as the big bang.
   John Bahcall, president of the American Astronomical Society,
said the Hubble will provide at least partial answers to
fundamental questions about the universe.
   But, he said, he will be disappointed ``if all we do is answer
these questions.''
   ``The most important discoveries will provide answers to
questions that we do not yet know how to ask,'' he said.

   Ryan White, ``the boy next door'' who put a
youthful face on AIDS and fought discrimination against its
victims, was mourned today by classmates who honored his 5{-year
struggle with the disease.
   White, 18, died shortly after 7 a.m. Sunday of lung congestion
from an AIDS-related respiratory infection. He had been in critical
condition on a ventilator at Riley Hospital for Children since
March 29.
   ``We will have a moment of silence and try to have school as
normal as possible today,'' Principal Steve Dillon told the 550
students of Hamilton Heights High School in Arcadia at an 8 a.m.
assembly today.
   White's death saddened many who had followed his battle with the
illness since 1985, when he made national headliines after being
barred from a public school system because of fears of the disease.
   ``I think one of the things we can all learn from Ryan is to be
courageous, not to give up, and fight as hard as you can for what
you want,'' Dillon said.
   Dillon said students who wanted to attend White's funeral
Wednesday would be given time off from class. The school's four
counselors would be available to students, who were encouraged to
discuss White's death with their teachers.
   Students arriving at the school passed by dozens of reporters
and camera crews from news organizations around the country. No
reporters were allowed on school grounds. Sheriff's deputies
provided extra security.
   White was recalled as a young man who ``made a difference.''
   ``He was the boy next door who first showed a stunned nation
that no one is safe from the risk of AIDS,'' said Dr. Martin B.
Kleiman, White's physician throughout his illness. ``He had no
bitterness.
   ``With an honest simplicity, his was the voice that many, if not
most, first heard, even though his was not the first voice.''
   ``At the end, his family and a few of the others who loved him
were close at his side,'' said Kleiman. ``He never regained
consciousness, and I am confident that he suffered no pain at the
end.''
   His mother, Jeanne, and his 16-year-old sister, Andrea, had kept
a bedside vigil, joined at times singer Elton John and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson. Singer Michael Jackson arrived in Indiana Sunday to
offer condolences to the family.
   His schoolmates at Hamilton Heights were shocked Sunday to learn
of White's death.
   ``I hoped they could find a cure before it was over,'' said
freshman Aaron Gilmore, 15. ``He was aware of what could happen.
But I remember him saying that he's going to live for five years,
until they find a cure. And if they didn't, he'd live for five
more, and keep going until they find a cure.''
   John, who stayed at the hospital with the Whites nearly a week,
dedicated the song ``Candle in the Wind'' to White during the Farm
Aid IV concert Saturday night at the Hoosier Dome, about a mile
from the hospital.
   ``This one's for Ryan,'' John said to the cheers of 45,000 fans
at the concert to raise funds for financially troubled farmers.
   President Bush, who last week planted a tree in White's honor in
downtown Indianapolis, said he and first lady Barbara were ``deeply
saddened'' by White's death.
   ``Ryan's death reaffirms that we as a people must pledge to
continue the fight, his fight, against this dreaded disease,'' Bush
said.
   White, born Dec. 16, 1971, in Kokomo, was 13 when he was
diagnosed with AIDS in December 1984. He had contracted acquired
immune deficiency syndrome through a blood-clotting agent used to
treat his hemophilia.
   In 1985, White was barred from Western Middle School near Kokomo
after school officials and parents rejected health authorities'
assurances that AIDS cannot be spread through casual contact.
   After months of school board battles and court hearings, White
won the right to attend school. But pressures on his family later
drove the Whites to the town of Cicero, and he enrolled at Hamilton
Heights High School in nearby Arcadia.
   In his new home, townspeople and fellow students rallied around
him and befriended him.
   White became a national spokesman for children with AIDS,
appearing at congressional hearings and fund-raisers, and the story
of his life was told in a 1989 made-for-TV movie.
   In 1988, White spoke before the National Education Association
and discussed his battle with AIDS.
   ``I stand before you to ask for your help,'' White told the
teachers. ``The many people against me said they weren't against
me, but against my disease. Help me beat the odds and together
let's educate and save the children of the world. By proper
education, AIDS can be a disease, not a dirty word.''
   Dr. Woodrow A Myers Jr., health commissioner of Indiana during
White's legal struggle, said White was chosen to lead the nation
out of ignorance and hatred of people with AIDS.
   ``This young man made a difference that may never again be
achieved,'' Myers said. ``Through his actions and his eyes he
taught us about ourselves. Only time will tell how well the lessons
were learned.''
   White's last public appearance was March 26 at an Oscar party
for ill children in Los Angeles with former President Reagan and
his wife, Nancy.
   Gov. Evan Bayh, who ordered flags at the Statehouse flown at
half-staff Wednesday in White's honor, called the youth ``an
American hero'' in a letter to Mrs. White.
   ``AIDS brought him to public attention, but his courage made him
special. We can hope and pray that his family finds peace and
consolation in the fact that, had the world not known Ryan White,
our understanding, treatment and concern for people with AIDS would
be harsher and more judgmental.''
   Funeral services were scheduled for Wednesday, but arrangements
were incomplete.

   Clashes between Hindus and Moslems today
left at least five people dead in the western state of Gujarat,
according to police and news reports.
   The latest deaths brought to 60 the total number of people
killed in Hindu-Moslem violence this year in Gujarat.
   Two people were stabbed to death and two others suffered knife
wounds in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the state, an officer at
the State Police Control Center said.
   Three more people were killed in Baroda, the United News of
India said.
   Neither the police nor UNI identified the victims by religion in
keeping with the policy of not publicizing religious conflicts.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at least
1,000 people have been arrested since sectarian religious violence
flared up in the state in the first week of March.
   The clashes reportedly broke out in Gujarat after a Hindu boy,
who was in love with a Moslem girl, was stabbed to death.
   Eighty-two percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus,
while 12 percent are Moslems.

<HEAD>Two Men Killed Trying to Outrun Train On Bridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARMA, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two fishermen surprised on a railroad bridge
by an oncoming freight train were struck and killed when they tried
to outrun it, authorities said.
   Troy Dean Ford, 20, was pronounced dead Sunday at the Union
Pacific Railroad trestle just above the Boise River's confluence
with the Snake River, Canyon County Chief Deputy Coroner Vicki
DeGeus said.
   David Lee Mott, 18, was taken by helicopter to St. Alphonsus
Regional Medical Center, where he also was declared dead.
   The men, both from Parma, had been fishing from the railroad
bridge adjacent to a dirt farm road when a witness reported hearing
someone yell, ``Train!'' said Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Williams.
   ``When he looked up, he saw the two males running south on the
bridge, which was the same way the train was running,'' Williams
said.
   The train, traveling 65 miles an hour through the open rural
country, was unable to stop in time. The men were struck about 60
feet from the east end of the trestle, DeGeus said.
   ``The train hit the one nearest the tracks, which forced him
into the other person, and then they were both bounced back and
forth between the bridge (struts and railing) and the train,''
Williams said.
   The engineer blew the train whistle and applied the brakes as
soon as the crew saw the pedestrians, initially hidden from view by
a curve west of the bridge, said Union Pacific spokesman Ed
Trandahl of Omaha, Neb.
   The train included eight engines, some of which were being moved
to new locations, and they might have helped the engineer actually
stop sooner than usually is possible, Trandahl said.
   The main track was closed for about two hours while officials
investigated and a new train crew arrived.
   The train was taken from the site by the crew of another
eastbound freight that had been about an hour away at the time of
the accident.
   ``We'll send this crew back home in a taxi,'' said Union Pacific
representative Gary Bonner of Nampa.

   A man sought in the killing of a customer
who was in line ahead of him at a drive-in fast-food restaurant was
charged with murder today after turning himself in.
   Gary Bernard Scott, 23, of Augusta, surrendered at the Richmond
County Law Enforcement Center and was held without bond,
authorities said. A warrant had been issued for his arrest.
   He is accused of killing Dale Brantley Peeler, 30, who got out
of his car to argue with two people who blew their horn at him when
he paused to check his order in the drive-through lane at a Krystal
restaurant last week.
   A 16-year-old who was with Scott was arrested Saturday and was
charged with being an accessory to murder, authorities said. His
name was not released because he is a juvenile.
   Richmond County Capt. J. ``Butch'' Wilhelm said Peeler was with
his girlfriend when the shooting took place about 2:45 a.m.
Thursday.
   He said Peeler had walked back to the other car to see what the
problem was when one occupant got out and exchanged words with
Peeler. He said a second passenger then got out and shot Peeler
twice.

<HEAD>Five Blacks Killed In Latest Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five blacks were killed in
violence over the past two days, including a boy who died when
police fired on stone-throwing protesters in a northern town,
police said today.
   Also today, police said they would be on special alert Tuesday
following the release of a pamphlet that calls on blacks to ``kill
all the white racists'' on April 10.
   The pamphlet, which circulated in black townships last week, was
issued under the name of the African National Congress. But ANC
deputy president Nelson Mandela said his organization had nothing
to do with the pamphlet and did not know who was responsible.
   ``If we all strike on the 10th of April we will win out against
the whites,'' the pamphlet said. ``Go choose your house in a white
area today. When we win the house will be yours.''
   Similar pamphlets have appeared in recent years, but have not
resulted in any outbreaks of violence, police said.
   Today's police unrest report, which covers incidents from the
preceding 24 hours, said a boy was killed when officers used pistol
fire to disperse a mob that was throwing stones at a police station
near the northcentral town of Danielskuil. Police did not specify
if police gunfire killed the boy.
   A policeman was killed when assailants threw two grenades at
officers headed toward a police station in Hlahatsi, east of
Johannesburg, the report said. A woman sleeping in a nearby house
also was killed in the Sunday night attack.
   Attackers killed a man by pouring gasoline on him and setting
him alight in Wedela, west of Johannesburg, police said, and he
body of a man who had been stabbed and hacked to death was found
near Paarl, east of Cape Town, the report said. No motives were
given in those attacks.
   More than 400 blacks have been killed in an upsurge of black
factional fighting since President F.W. de Klerk legalized more
than 60 black opposition groups Feb. 2.
   Large numbers of black workers in the southeastern cities of
Durban and Pietermaritzburg stayed home today to protest police
action in the black homeland of KwaZulu. Activists barricaded roads
with stones and tires and some businesses were forced to close
because of lack of staff.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which is allied with
the African National Congress, called the protest.
   Supporters of the ANC have been battling members of the
relatively conservative Inkatha movement since 1986, resulting in
some 4,000 deaths. The ANC and the trade union congress have
accused both South African police and KwaZulu police of siding with
Inkatha.

<HEAD>Coalition Talks Produce Cabinet Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weary negotiators today agreed on a Cabinet
list for a coalition to replace the caretaker Communist government,
but divisions remained over plans for unification with West Germany
and conversion to capitalism.
   Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democrat leader named to form
a government, said ``a first-rate climate'' prevailed in today's
talks after a grueling five-hour session the previous night.
   The leadership of each party still must give a green light to
the proposed list already agreed upon by the negotiators, de
Maiziere told reporters, adding he hopes to have the Cabinet ready
to present to Parliament on Thursday.
   Officials did not say who was on the proposed Cabinet list.
   Leaders of the Social Democratic Party, which won the
second-largest number of votes in the country's first free election
March 18, expressed satisfaction on the course of today's talks but
said differences still had to be discussed.
   Guenther Krug, spokesman for the Social Democrats, said there
were ``substantial differences'' with the conservative alliance led
by the Christian Democrats that will be the dominant force in the
new government.
   ``We assume that difficult negotiations lie ahead,'' Krug said.
   Among the issues which still must be clarified are Germany's
relationship to NATO after unification, internal security and the
thorny issue of private property.
   The left-leaning Social Democrats favor a more gradual form of
unification than the conservative Christian Democrats. East Germany
faces a tough road ahead in converting to capitalism after more
than 40 years of communist rule.
   Lothar de Maiziere leads a three-party alliance that holds the
most seats in the 400-member Parliament and closely follows the
policies of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, head of his
country's Christian Democrats.
   De Maizier's alliance lacks the two-thirds majority that is
needed to enact constitutional changes to allow unification with
West Germany.
   A coalition with the Social Democrats would give de Maiziere
control, but if negotiations with that party fail, he can try to
build coalitions with other political parties.
   The Social Democrats are calling for employee participation in
the ownership of former state-owned companies, while the Christian
Democrats favor complete privatization.
   The Social Democrats, who finished second in the elections, also
were demanding that the Christian Democrats use their close
connections with Kohl to obtain a copy of West Germany's proposed
blueprint for reunification.
   The treaty being discussed in Bonn would set out the laws that
would be applied in a unified Germany, in effect outlining the
terms for combining their social and economic structures.
   The Social Democrats have said that they will press to preserve
at least some of East Germany's extensive social welfare system if
they participate in the government.

<TEXT>
   Crowds lined up again today to see photographs
by the late Robert Mapplethorpe that have resulted in obscenity
indictments against an art center.
   The 175-photograph exhibit includes seven pictures deemed
objectionable Saturday by a Hamilton County grand jury, which
indicted the Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis
Barrie.
   U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin issued an emergency protective
order on Sunday that allows the show to remain open and unchanged.
About 100 people waited in line today to get into the museum.
   ``I think we have a right to see it,'' Roshani Soyza, a
University of Cincinnati law student, said outside the museum.
``The artist has a great reputation.''
   After the museum opened at 10 a.m., security guards let people
in 10 at a time. They said they wanted to avoid crowding.
   The indictment sparked public interest in the show Sunday, when
the center opened an hour early to accommodate a large crowd.
   ``We're here as a show of support,'' said Michael Moore,
accompanied by his wife, Diane. ``I thought (the indictment) was
absurd and ridiculous. It lends a backward light to the city of
Cincinnati.''
   Arts center employees estimated that about 10,000 people saw the
exhibit over the weekend, including a private showing for members
on Friday night. That made it the biggest opening ever for the
downtown center.
   County Prosecutor Arthur Ney on Saturday did not rule out the
possibiliity of seizing the photos if the center didn't remove
seven photographs, which depict homosexual acts or children with
their genitals exposed.
   But the judge granted the art center a protective order during
an unusual Sunday morning hearing. Rubin said he was concerned that
the legal questions ``can be rendered moot'' if the exhibit is
closed or partially seized.
   ``You may not recover any photos, you may not close the exhibit
to the public, you may not take any action that could be
intimidating in nature to prevent the public from seeing the
exhibit,'' Rubin told lawyers for the county and city.
   The center hailed the protective order.
   ``That's all we wanted, just to stop the continued threats,''
said the center's lawyer, H. Louis Sirkin.
   James W. Harper, chief assistant prosecuting attorney for civil
cases, also was upbeat about the ruling.
   ``It isn't our intention to seize the pictures,'' he said.
   The president of Citizens for Community Values, a leader in
organizing opposition to the exhibit, had little comment on Rubin's
ruling.
   ``It's time to let the legal system run its course,'' Monty Lobb
Jr. said. The next step is Barrie's arraignment Friday, at which he
is expected to plead innocent to charges of pandering obscenity and
illegal use of a minor in pornographic material.
   The two counts carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and
fines of up to $2,000. The center was indicted on identical
charges, carrying a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine.
   The question of whether the seven photos are obscene will be
left to an eight-member jury. A trial date is expected to be set
Friday.
   The exhibit is scheduled to run through May 26 and move to
Boston in August.
   Some of those who saw the exhibit over the weekend said they saw
nothing obscene.
   ``I saw the show. I don't think it's obscene. There's some rough
stuff I wouldn't want kids to see, but that doesn't mean adults
shouldn't see it,'' Councilman Guy Guckenberger said.
   The arts center is not admitting people under 18 and has put up
a warning sign at the door.
   The University of Pennsylvania's Institute of Contemporary Art
organized the exhibit in the fall of 1988. It drew crowds in
Philadelphia in December 1988 and in Chicago at the time of
Mapplethorpe's March 1989 death from acquired immune deficiency
yndrome. Mapplethorpe, 42, lived in New York City.
   Last June, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.,
canceled the exhibit. The Washington exhibit prompted Congress to
limit funds for the arts after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared
the photographs obscene.

   The conservative New Democrats declared
victory today after Greece's third parliamentary election in 10
months, and party leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he will form a
government this week.
   Election officials said Mitsotakis' New Democracy party had won
150 of Parliament's 300 seats in Sunday's election, just one seat
short of the majority needed to govern alone.
   New Democracy had fallen just short of a majority in
inconclusive June and November elections.
   Mitsotakis met today with Costis Stephanopoulos, the leader of
the small Democratic Renewal party which won one seat, in an effort
to gain the support needed to form Greece's first right-wing
government in nine years.
   After a 30-minute meeting, Stephanopoulos announced that his
conservative group would support New Democracy in order to give it
the necessary 151-seat parliamentary majority. Stephanopoulos, a
former member of New Democracy, broke away from the party four
years ago following a dispute with Mitsotakis.
   Before meeting with Stephanopoulos, Mitsotakis had expressed
confidence at an early morning post-election news conference that
he could form a government.
   ``In today's elections the Greek people decided,'' the
71-year-old Mitsotakis said. ``They gave the victory to New
Democracy. In my view, with 150 seats we can form a government, and
we will win the approval of Parliament.''
   Stephanopoulos' support will end a 10-months political impasse
that has left Greece unable to cope with a crumbling economy and
growing urban terrorism.
   Under the constitution, Mitsotakis must first get the nod to
form a government from President Christos Sartzetakis.
   Party officials said Mitsotakis would meet with Sartzetakis on
Tuesday and announce the members of his cabinet the following day.
   A New Democracy spokesman said Mitsotakis would seek a vote of
confidence when Parliament officially convenes April 23.
   The official returns showed New Democracy with 46.89 percent of
the vote, up slightly from the party's 46.19 percent showing in
November's inconclusive election.
   The left-of-center Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) had
38.62 percent of the vote and 123 parliamentary seats, while a
Communist-led alliance of leftist parties had 10.28 percent and 19
seats. Small parties and independents took the remaining eight
seats with a combined 3.21 percent of the vote.
   The socialists and communists, blocked from forming a coalition
of their own, remained united in their opposition to the
conservatives' plans to turn the ailing economy around.
   ``We will defend the vested interests of the Greek people,''
said PASOK leader and former Premier Andreas Papandreou, who did
not concede defeat early today. ``PASOK will wage its battle both
inside and outside of Parliament.''
   New Democracy has taken a tough line on tackling the country's
economic problems, which include an estimated $15.6 billion budget
deficit and an inflation rate of about 17 percent. The
conservatives have pledged to liberalize the economy, slash public
spending, cut the country's unwieldy public sector and attract
foreign investment.
   PASOK supports state intervention in the economy. The party
wants to step up productivity in the public sector but not cut
public spending.
   The brief conservative-Communist coalition government formed
after the June election and the all-party coalition forged after
the November polls both postponed key decisions on the economy.
   If Mitsotakis can form a government, it will mark the
conservatives' return to power after losing in a landslide to
Papandreou's PASOK in 1981.
   New Democracy and the Communists indicted Papandreou and several
members of his eight-year administration in September on charges of
corruption. No trial date has been set, however.
   A New Democracy victory could mean Greece will make
long-postponed decisions on a U.S. extradition request for a
Palestinian wanted for the 1982 bombing of an airliner over Hawaii,
and on a new military bases agreement with the United States.
   Mitsotakis has said that he considers the four U.S. military
bases crucial for the defense of Greece. He has also said that he
would extradite Mohammed Rashid, the Palestinian wanted by the
United States.

   A woman is challenging a judge's ruling
that she cannot change her surname without her husband's permission.
   Lucille Anne Riccitelli has filed an appeal of a probate judge's
decision in Superior Court, saying she would like to use her maiden
name because there are no more men to carry it on, according to
court papers.
   The American Civil Liberties Union's Rhode Island affiliate said
today it would back Riccitelli in her fight. She already is using
her maiden name of Riccitelli, instead of her married name of
Martin, on all legal documents except one bank account.
   On March 8, Providence Probate Judge Anthony B. Sciarretta asked
Riccitelli her marital status ``and upon learning that she was
married and would not obtain her husband's written consent, denied
her petition,'' Riccitelli's lawyer, A. Gregory Frazier, said in
court papers filed Friday.
   Riccitelli's husband, Edward Martin, said he supports his wife's
efforts. However, Frazier said Riccitelli, 41, doesn't ``feel she
has any obligation to get her husband's permission.''
   In 1979, the state Supreme Court ruled that anyone can change
his or her name without court approval as long as the name is used
consistently and is not used to evade creditors or law enforcement
officials, Frazier said.
   Frazier said cases such as Riccitelli's are not unique. He
added, however, that because of the way the city's probate court
system is set up, many who are denied name changes are unable to
appeal.
   Because court fees are not assessed in those cases where the
request is denied, there is no record of the case. Only those who
are given approval to change their names are assessed a court fee.
   Riccitelli, however, insisted on paying the fee even though her
request was denied in order for the case to go on record. This
enabled her to document the case and appeal to a higher court,
Frazier said.

   The Palestinian terrorist group led by
Abu Nidal said today it will free three European hostages it holds
by the end of this month.
   But the Fatah-Revolutionary Council linked the freedom of four
other European hostages _ all Belgians _ to the release of a
Palestinian serving a life sentence in Belgium for a grenade attack
on Jewish youths.
   Walid Khaled, spokesman for Fatah-Revolutionary Council, said
three hostages will be released by the end of the current Islamic
holy month of Ramadan. The month is expected to end around April
26, depending on when the new moon is sighted.
   He listed the three as French hostage Jacqueline Valente, 32,
her Belgian boyfriend Ferdinand Houtekins, in his 40s, and their
2-year-old daughter Sophie who was born in captivity .
   The couple were hostages since November 1987, when their yacht
was seized in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of the
Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip.
   Last week, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called for the release
of Ms. Valente as a compassionate measure to mark the Ramadan holy
month of Ramadan.
   Khaled would not comment on freedom for a second Valente
daughter believed to have been born in captivity after Sophie.
   ``Ms. Valente will talk about that when she is released,'' he
said.
   The other Belgians being held by Abu Nidal's group are Emmanuel
Houtekins, in his 40s, his wife Godelieve Kets, age unavailable;
his son Laurent and daughter Valerie, both teenagers. They were
also seized on the yacht.
   Referring to the four Belgian hostages, Khaled brought up the
case of Nasser Sa'eed, a Palestinian who received a life sentence
for a June 27, 1980, attack against Jewish youths in Antwerp that
killed a 15-year-old and injured 20 other people.
   ``Freeing Nasser Sa'eed is a basic demand for the resumption of
negotiations related to the release of the four Belgians,'' Khaled
said, speaking to reporters at his office in Beirut's Mar Elias
Palestinian refugee camp. He refused to elaborate.
   The Belgian daily De Morgen published an interview today with
Sa'eed, who is being held at Leuven prison.
   ``It is my release which is being demanded by the
hostage-takers,'' the paper quoted Sa'eed as saying. ``They made
that clear. My release can only be a political decision.''
   Under Belgian law, Sa'eed can ask for early release later this
year.
   On Sunday, Abu Nidal's group said that plans to free Ms.
Valente, Ferdinand Houtekins and the child were proceeding
according to plan.
   But it criticized Belgian Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet for
``reneging in public statements on commitments made during
unannounced negotiations.''
   Wathelet said last week that he had made no promises to obtain
the release of the hostages.
   Abu Nidal's group announced on Nov. 8, 1987, that it had seized
a group of hostages from the French yacht Silco off the Gaza Strip
and accused them of collaborating with Israel's Mossad intelligence
agency. Friends said the group was on a holiday cruise.
   Because the boat hostages are believed to be in Libya, they are
not listed among the 18 Western hostages missing in Lebanon. Most
of them are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions. The
longest-held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, split with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1970s and formed
the Fatah-Revolutionary Council.
   The group has been blamed for scores of terrorist attacks,
including the December 1985 attacks on the Rome and Vienna airports
that killed more than 20 people.

<HEAD>Ex-Policeman Convicted in Neighbor's Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EXETER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The convoluted murder trial of a former
policeman charged with the shotgun slaying of a neighbor ended
today with his conviction for first-degree murder and conspiracy to
commit murder.
   Robert McLaughlin, 49, had been a Hampton police officer for 18
years when he admitted killing Robert Cushing with two shotgun
blasts on the evening of June 1, 1988. His lawyers argued that
McLaughlin was insane.
   McLaughlin's ex-wife, Susan Cook, already has been found guilty
of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. Cook, who divorced
McLaughlin after her conviction, is appealing her sentence to life
in prison.
   The Rockingham County Superior Court jury returned the verdict
after 3{ days of deliberations. McLaughlin stood expressionless as
the jury announced its verdict and the individual jurors were
polled.
   The conviction carries a sentence of life in prison without
parole. Defense lawyer Michael Iacopino said the verdict will be
appealed to the state Supreme Court. No date was set for sentencing.
   In the courtroom audience, Cushing's family wept as the rulings
were announced. Cushing's son, Robert Jr., said the family members
are glad that McLaughlin had been convicted, but now hope to put
the tragedy behind them.
   Cushing, 63, a former schoolteacher and successful real estate
agent, was cut down when he opened the door of his Hampton home.
Shocked neighbors and police were baffled until McLaughlin turned
himself two months later.
   His wife was convicted first, however, and during his pretrial
hearings, McLaughlin testified that she had killed Cushing. His
lawyers produced letters Cook wrote to McLaughlin from prison, in
which she admitted killing the neighbor.
   Then, without explanation, McLaughlin's lawyers quit the case.
It was delayed until new counsel could be found. Cook obtained a
divorce earlier this year.
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Barbara Keshen contrasted a
``desperately unhappy'' McLaughlin with a contented, successful
Cushing. The two had feuded for 13 years, and Keshen said the
murder was the well-planned action of an angry, bitter man.
   Iacopino said in his closing statement that McLaughlin conceived
the murder plan under a veil of alcohol and a large dose of a
prescription drug, Xanax. He said McLaughlin was under his wife's
influence when he killed Cushing.
   Robert McLaughlin Jr. testified against his father and Cook, 38,
at their trials. ``They both get what they deserve,'' he said
today. ``They took someone's life away and for that they deserve to
pay with their own lives.''

<TEXT>
   Pepsico Inc. and the Soviet Union signed an
agreement today to trade Pepsi-Cola for ships and vodka.
   The deal is the largest between a U.S. corporation and the
Soviet Union, and comes just two months before a ummit between
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It represents more than $3 billion in retail sales of Pepsi-Cola
and Stolichnaya Russian Vodka and would make Pepsi-Cola more widely
available in the Soviet Union.
   Since 1974, the Purchase, N.Y.-based company has shipped its
soft-drink syrup to the Soviet Union, where it is made into cola
and sold in bottles. The company took its profits out in vodka,
selling it through a third party in the United States.
   Today's agreement will allow Pepsico to take some profits out
during the next decade in the form of at least 10 oceangoing
freighters and tankers valued at $300 million. The vessels will be
sold or leased to international markets, Pepsico said.
   Pepisco said it eventually will be permitted to sell Pepsi in
plastic bottles and aluminum cans instead of just the glass bottles
now allowed in the Soviet Union. Pepsi sells in the Soviet Union
for the equivalent of 75 cents for an 11-ounce bottle.
   ``This agreement reflects increasingly closer ties between the
U.S., the Soviet Union and other Western interests, and the
expressed optimism for the shared future,'' said Donald M. Kendall,
chairman of Pepsico's executive committee.
   The contract was signed by Kendall and Soviet officials,
including several members of the Soviet Commission of Agriculture
and Procurement.
   In a news release, Pepsico said its Pepsi plants in the Soviet
Union will increase to 50 from the current 24. It said it planned
to pay for that expansion with proceeds from vodka sales.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCI Communications Corp. and Telecom USA Inc.
today announced they have agreed to merge in a $1.25 billion
transaction.
   Under terms of the deal, which has been approved by the boards
of directors of both companies, MCI will acquire all outstanding
shares of Telecom USA's common stock for $42 a share.
   Telecom USA stock jumped $15.87{ higher to $37.75 a share in
heavy midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. MCI was down
87{ cents at $36 a share.
   The transaction is subject to approval by Telecom's stockholders.
   ``The prospect of merging two dynamic, high-growth companies
with similar cultures is very exciting,'' said Bert C. Roberts Jr.,
MCI's president and chief operating officer. ``Combining their
strengths will benefit shareholders, customers and employees
alike.''
   The proposed acquisition continues a pattern by MCI, which has
increased its market share in part by buying smaller long-distance
phone companies. In the last few years it has bought Satellite
Business Systems, Western Union International and RCA Global
Communications.
   MCI, which is headquartered in Washington, is the nation's
second-largest long distance phone company after American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Co. Telecom, based in Atlanta, is the fourth-largest.
Telecom primarily serves customers in the Southeast and Midwest.
   MCI's 1989 revenues totaled $6.5 billion, while Telecom had $713
million in sales last year.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the announcement showed how
``hotly competitive'' the industry is. AT&amp;T, the dominant long
distance carrier, is asking the Federal Communications Commission
to loosen some regulatory ties on AT&amp;T that other companies do not
face.
   ``This development today is further evidence of the need for
that,'' said Linnen. ``It suggests two vigorous companies are
combining forces to provide even more competition. ... We wake up
every day to a real knockdown, drag-out fight in the marketplace.''
   AT&amp;T holds about 64 percent of the long distance market, down
from about 90 percent before the court-ordered breakup of the old
Bell system in 1984, and had $19.5 billion in revenues last year,
said Linnen. FCC figures showed MCI with about 12 percent of the
market and Sprint with 9 percent.
   Roberts said both companies have played a major role in
``advancing technology, developing innovative services, and meeting
customer requirements.''
   He added: ``We look forward to having Telecom USA management and
employees assume roles in the new structure, and welcome the
opportunity to serve its customers.''
   O. Gene Gabbard, Telecom's chairman and chief executive officer,
said MCI recognizes his company's ``creative approach'' to product
development and marketing.
   ``Both companies stand to gain by teaming employees, facilities
and services, and as a unified force, working to further enhance
the ability to provide the highest value services in this rapidly
growing and demanding industry,'' Gabbard said.
   The merger is subject to government approval under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. It is expected to be concluded as quickly as
possible, the companies said in a joint news release.
   The complete terms of the merger will be included in a proxy
statement to be mailed to Telecom shareholders.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine French Basque militants suspected of being
part of a roving commando unit that carried out terrorist attacks
in Spain have been charged and jailed, judicial sources said Monday.
   The nine, eight men and one woman, were transferred Sunday to
Paris from Bayonne in a military transport plane. Judge Gilles
Boulouque, who specializes in terrorist investigations, charged
them Sunday night with criminal association related to a terrorist
enterprise, the judicial sources said, speaking on condition they
not be named. Three of them were also charged with possession of
arms and explosives.
   The sources said that six of the nine admitted taking part in
numerous attacks on Spanish soil. No charges on those counts were
immediately brought because Spanish authorities had not yet
officially complained to France.
   The nine were arrested Wednesday, two days after Spanish police
arrested another Frenchman, Henri Parot, in Seville, Spain. Police
found 660 pounds of explosives in his car. Parot confessed to
participating in attacks that killed 33 people in Spain over the
past few years, Spanish police sources said Sunday.
   Parot's brother, Jean Parot, was among the nine arrested last
week.
   The alleged commando unit is said to have trained in the hills
of France's Basque country, in southwestern France. They are
accused of being members of a French network of the Spanish ETA
movement, which is fighting for independence for the Spanish Basque
country.

<TEXT>
   A man believed to be the No. 2
official in the Communist rebel army was arrested Monday along with
two alleged rebel officials, the military announced.
   Also Monday, military sources said an officer jailed for trying
to overthrow President Corazon Aquino in August 1987 had escaped.
   Antonio Cabardo, reputed deputy chief of staff of the New
People's Army, was taken into custody Monday afternoon after
returning to Manila from Hong Kong, said Col. Agerico Kagaoan.
   Kagaoan, chief of security for the Philippine Constabulary, said
Cabardo and two female companions were stopped as they drove from
Ninoy Aquino International Airport.
   Agnes Quitoriano and another woman carrying a passport
identifying her as Maria Velarde were also arrested, Kagaoan said.
Their driver escaped.
   Police found three handguns and about $1,500 in their vehicle,
according to police spokesman Lt. Col. Cresencio Maralit.
   Cabardo is also believed to be a member of the political bureau
of the outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines. The military
had offered a $23,800 reward for his capture.
   He is believed to be the No. 2 official of the 20,000-strong
Communist army. The army leader is Romulo Kintanar. He escaped from
prison in November 1988.
   Kagaoan said the women arrested were believed to be members of
the Communist Party's International Liaison Group. It coordinates
weapons shipments and is responsible for overseeing businesses and
other operations abroad.
   It was unclear why the group had gone to Hong Kong, but the
rebels are believed to maintain bank accounts in the British colony
and elsewhere in Asia.
   The arrests were described as a major blow to the Communists.
They occurred one day after the embarrassing escape from prison of
Lt. Col. Billy Bibit, former customs security chief and a leader of
the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.
   Bibit was freed when a group of rebels raided the Manila jail
during a drinking spree by jail guards. The jail superintendent was
fired and three guards, including a deputy warden, were arrested
for negligence.
   Also Monday, military sources said air force Capt. Rogelio
Seradoy, held in connection with an August 1987 coup attempt, had
escaped from Villamor Air Base.
   Seradoy piloted the helicopter used by coup leader Gregorio
Honasan to escape after the attempt failed.
   Sources said there were conflicting reports on Seradoy's escape.
According to one report, he jumped from a window early Monday and
fled. Another said he failed to return from a two-day furlough
granted Friday.

   Ethiopian rebels said Monday two people

Massawa. They said it was the fourth such raid in five days.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the
Eritrean People's Liberation Front said the latest attack was
Sunday and killed two civilians.
   The rebels accused the Ethiopian air force of targeting
civilians with cluster bombs. A rebel spokesman in London said
napalm also had been dropped on the port.
   Cluster bombs contain dozens of smaller bombs that are dispersed
upon impact, hurling their shrapnel over a wide area.

<TEXT>
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk on Monday urged an immediate cease-fire in his
country and said the U.N. Security Council should deploy
peacekeeping troops to enforce it.
   The proposed peacekeeping force would comprise American, Chinese
and Soviet soldiers.
   Sihanouk is head of a three-faction guerrilla alliance fighting
the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia. He said there was
a moral responsibility to find a solution to end the 11-year-old
war.
   Sihanouk said no winners will emerge from the conflict but that
the big losers will be the ``small citizenry of Cambodia.''
   In a statement issued from the village in northwestern Cambodia
where he lives, Sihanouk said the five-member U.N. Security Council
should send a peacekeeping force and along with the warring
factions, proclaim an immediate cease-fire.
   The peacekeeping force should wear the ``blue helmet'' of the
United Nations, he said.
   The five security council members are Britain, China, France,
the Soviet Union and the United States.
   Sihanouk said the administrative power of the two warring groups
in Cambodia should be transferred to a U.N. administrative
authority, which would work alongside a supreme national council
symbolizing national sovereignty.
   The council would be made up of six guerrilla members and six
from the existing government, he said.
   Sihanouk was head of state in Cambodia until his government was
ousted in a 1970 coup. The government that replaced his was in turn
ousted by the communist Khmer Rouge in 1975.
   The Khmer Rouge's brutal rule ended in late 1978, when Vietnam
invaded and set up the existing government. The Khmer Rouge is the
strongest guerrilla faction in the alliance with Sihanouk.
   Vietnam said it pulled the last of its soldiers out of Cambodia
last fall, but guerrillas have alleged that some Vietnamese have
returned to fight alongside the Cambodian soldiers.

<HEAD>No Blasphemy Trial For Rushdie, Court Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The High Court on Monday rejected a bid by a
Moslem group to prosecute author Salman Rushdie and publishers
Viking Penguin for blasphemy in connection with Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   A panel of three judges upheld a lower court decision not to
issue summonses against Rushdie and his publishers. It said Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate Sir David Hopkin ruled correctly last year
that Britain's blasphemy laws apply only to the Christian religion.
   Many Moslems believe Rushdie's novel blasphemes Islam. The
writer has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989, when Iran's late
spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on
Moslems to execute him and those closely connected with the book's
publication.
   During a four-day hearing, the British Moslem Action Front
argued blasphemy laws should be extended to protect other
religions, including Islam.
   One of the Front's lawyers, Mohammed Akhtar, said: ``It's a sad
day for race relations in this country and for the reputation of
British justice. But we have succeeded in exposing the inadequate
and the discriminatory nature of the British laws.''
   The common law doctrine of blasphemy was laid down in 1675 by
Chief Justice Sir Matthew Hale. He referred specifically to the
Christian religion, but that was before Britain had large immigrant
communities of other religions.
   The last successful prosecution for blasphemous libel in Britain
was in 1979 over a poem depicting Jesus Christ as a homosexual.
   Rushdie issued a statement through his lawyer saying he was
grateful for the court's ruling. He called for changes to Britain's
blasphemy laws.
   ``I regret that our blasphemy law discriminates between
religions as well as discriminating against humanists and
non-believers,'' he said.
   ``I join with many persons of good will in urging Parliament to
take the earliest opportunity to end this discrimination by
abolishing an anachronistic crime which still, notwithstanding
today's decision, carries dangers for freedom of expression.''
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in India 42 years ago. He
now is a British citizen and has left his faith.
   He reiterated in his statement that ``even if the blasphemy law
extended to Islam, my book cannot fairly be interpreted as a
scurrilous or insulting attack on that faith.''

   The leader of Latvia's Supreme Soviet said Monday
he is certain Latvian legislators will vote to secede from the
Soviet Union when they meet next month but that the independence
process will be gradual.
   Anatolijs Gorbunovs, president of the Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, said full separation is to be achieved in
``negotiations and discussions.''
   He spoke at a news conference two days after a Communist Party
congress in Latvia rejected a proposal to establish a Communist
Party independent of the central Soviet party. About 300 of the 700
delegates at the congress walked out to protest the vote.
   Gorbunovs said the party split made clear the support for
independence in Latvia. There is ``no doubt'' the required
two-thirds majority will be achieved when parliament meets in May
and considers independence, he said.
   Gorbunovs said this would have to be followed by a ``complicated
process'' to resolve all problems related to Soviet-Latvian
relations ``in the interest of both sides.''
   Gorbunovs, a member of the breakaway Communist Party, said he
met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev last month and that
Gorbachev told him he should submit his independence proposals in
writing.
   He said he did so in a letter sent to Gorbachev, but he refused
to disclose details of his plan.
   Gorbunovs and other pro-independence Latvian lawmakers were in
Switzerland for a symposium this week marking the 125th birthday of
Latvian writer Janis Rainis. Rainis lived in exile in Switzerland
until 1920.
   Latvia was one of the three Baltic republics forcibly annexed by
the Kremlin in 1940. The others are Lithuania and Estonia.
   Lithuania declared itself independent March 11, leading to a
standoff with the Kremlin that is still going on. Estonia also has
a strong pro-independence movement.
   Edvins Inkens, a senior member of the pro-independent Latvian
Popular Front, said he met last month with Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis. Landsbergis had ``one major request _ that
Latvia declare independence as quickly as possible because a united
front of three republics is no longer just a regional problem,''
Inkens said.
   Gorbunovs said the three republics follow a ``united path.
Differences are only in tactics, but the strategic goals are
identical.''
   ``We would like to achieve that (goal) through negotiations and
discussions,'' he said. ``Practically, our stance coincides with
Gorbachev's stance. But whether Gorbachev will consequently realize
this stance is another question.''

   Air Marshal Yevgeny Savitsky, a World War II
fighter ace whose daughter was the second woman in space, has died
at age 80, the official Soviet Tass news agency said Monday.
   The news agency said Savitsky died Friday ``after a grave and
long illness.''
   An obituary signed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
other leaders called Savitsky ``a faithful son of the Soviet people
who dedicated his entire life to selfless service to his socialist
motherland, and the affairs of the Communist Party.''
   Savitsky flew 216 missions during World War II, battling German
fighter planes over the Soviet Union, Poland and Germany. He shot
down 22 enemy planes during the war.
   After the war, he rose to the rank of air marshal and commanded
the country's anti-aircraft defense air force.
   His daughter, Svetlana, became a test pilot and later a
cosmonaut. She became the second woman in space with a flight in a
Soyuz T-7 capsule that began Aug. 19, 1982.
   She flew a second Soyuz mission in 1984, and on that mission
became the first woman to walk in space.

   The jackpot _ $58,320,000 _ surpasses the Florida record set in
September 1988 when $55.16 million was paid out. That went to a
single winner and is still a world record payout to one person.
   There have been several multi-winner lottery prizes in other
states that exceed Saturday's Florida jackpot.
   Tickets were selling as fast as 552 a second Saturday, setting a
weekly sales record of $56.1 million. Just over $22 million worth
of tickets were sold Saturday, a new daily record.
   ``Our sales were so high they were in orbit,'' Mrs. Paul said
Saturday. The previous weekly sales record was $44 million. The old
daily record was $16.4 million.
   No one had claimed a share of the pot as of Sunday. Winners have
180 days from the date the date of the drawing to come forward.
   The number of winners means that Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs,
the sole winner of the Lotto jackpot that reached $55.16 million in
September 1988, will still hold the world record for the biggest
prize won by an individual in a weekly numbers game.

   Wanted: Tropical lot for relocation. Must
move. Variety of neighbors preferred. Wet basement a must.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is looking
for a new location for Aquarius, its undersea research station.
   The relocation is needed because Hurricane Hugo damaged on-shore
support facilities at the current location in the Virgin Islands.
   The 81-ton underwater research lab itself was not damaged.
   The agency plans to move Aquarius this summer and wants a
location in the Caribbean, Florida Keys or the Bahamas.
   Major factors in the new location will be access to power,
telephone service, water and emergency care. In addition,
scientists prefer a site with a diversity of plant and animal life
and ecosystems for research.
   Teams of up to six scientists work in the lab for several days
at a time conducting undersea research.
   More than two dozen teams have worked in the lab since it was
located off St. Croix in 1987.
   Recommendations for a new location for Aquarius can be sent to
Dr. David Duane, Director, National Undersea Research Program,
NOAA, 6010 Executive Boulevard, Rockville, Md., 20852.

   A judge set legal proceedings in motion
Monday to sentence 12 convicted drug smugglers to death, the Middle
East News agency reported.
   The state-owned news agency said Judge Gamal Abdel-Halim of the
Cairo criminal court sent the files of the 12 to Egypt's highest
Moslem cleric for an opinion. That means the court plans to
sentence them to death.
   Abdel-Halim postponed judgment on 18 other defendants in the
same case until May 10, the news agency said.
   The 30 men, who include Egyptians, Sudanese, Lebanese and a
Turk, were charged with smuggling and distributing 10 tons of
hashish and 858 pounds of opium in Egypt. The prosecution said the
defendants brought the drugs in by boat through the Red Sea.

<DATELINE>LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist reformer got the most
votes for president of Slovenia in Yugoslavia's first free election
since the 1940s, but must face a conservative rival in a runoff,
election results showed Monday.
   With 98 percent of the presidential vote counted from Sunday's
elections in the liberal northern province, Communist candidate
Milan Kucan led with 44.4 percent. Joze Pucnik of the conservative
DEMOS coalition was second with 26.2 percent.
   Ivan Kramberger, an independent, ran third with 18.9 percent.
The fourth candidate, Marko Demsar of the Liberal Party, got 10.5
percent of the votes.
   A runoff of the two leaders will be held April 22 because
neither won a majority.
   An estimated 1.1 million Slovenians, 75 percent of the eligible
voters, participated in the balloting. It was communist
Yugoslavia's first multiparty election since World War II. In
addition to a president, they chose a legislature from candidates
representing 17 political parties.
   The results ``suggest that Slovenians have opted for a peaceful
transition from a single-party monopoly to a parliamentary
democracy,'' Kucan, a leading reformer in the Communist Party, told
The Associated Press.
   Pucnik said he expected to win the runoff ``because those who
voted for Kramberger and Demsar will probably vote for me.'' The
former dissident, a philosopy professor, spent seven years in
prison in the 1950s for opposing communism.
   He returned to Slovenia last year after more than 20 years of
exile in West Germany. Pucnik said he was ``satisfied with the
success in the first round of the elections,'' because he ``was
until recently virtually unknown in the republic.''
   Political analysts predict a close contest in the runoff. Pucnik
wants Slovenia to secede from Yugoslavia, but Kucan advocates a
more cautious approach.
   Initial results suggest the Slovenian Communist Party, which
recently changed its name to the Party of Democratic Renewal, will
become the largest single party in the republic's legislature but
that DEMOS, a coalition of five conservative groups, will have the
most seats.
   Partial results indicated the renamed Communists would have
about 21 percent of the 240 seats and DEMOS about 35 percent.
Election officials said results of the legislative elections would
not be complete until Tuesday or Wednesday.
   Support for secession has grown in Slovenia, the most liberal
and prosperous of Yugoslavia's six republics, because of the slow
pace of political and economic reform elsewhere in the federation.
   Reform-minded Slovenian Communists have created pluralistic
politics in the past three years despite criticism from Serbia, the
largest Yugoslav republic. Serbian leaders favor continued
dominance by the Communist Party.
   Kucan said he hoped the other republics, including Serbia, would
hold free elections in 1990 ``so people there can elect their
legitimate leaderships.''
   Croatia, the second-largest republic, has elections scheduled
later this month, but no plans have been announced by the other
four republics.
   Official Serbian media virtually ignored the Slovenian elections
and said all Slovenian parties and presidential candidates had the
common goal of secession.
   Kramberger, a restaurant owner and charity worker who needed
6,000 petition signatures to run as an independent, said he was
forming a new party whose members would be the ``poor, sick and
unprivileged.''
   Those who want to join the party ``will first have to prove they
are not Communists,'' he said.

   Activist Angela Davis says black college students
today are in a better position to identify and challenge racism
from curriculums and from overt racist attacks on campus.
   Ms. Davis told black students at Georgia State University to
push mostly white universities to create black studies programs to
crush on-campus racism.
   ``The message we must bring to campus communities across the
country is that the problem is not so much ours,'' she said. ``We
fought for the right of African-American students to have access to
the educational institutions of this country only to realize that
the education ... was flawed in and of itself.''
   The conference she addressed Saturday was devoted to problems of
black students at predominantly white colleges.
   Ms. Davis was acquitted of aiding radicals in a courthouse
shooting in Marin County, Calif., in 1972. In 1980, she was a vice
presidential candidate on the Communist Party ticket. She now
teaches women's and ethnic studies at San Francisco State
University.

husband, Harry, dine at home these days to avoid harassment.
   ``It's rare that we go out,'' she said in the May issue of the

   A federal judge has sentenced her to serve four years in prison

disguising purchases for herself and her $11 million mansion as
business expenses.
   In a pending state case, she is accused of falsifying $3 million
worth of business records between 1982 and 1986.
   Her husband was found incompetent to stand trial on the federal
charges and attorneys have asked for a similar ruling on the state

<HEAD>Administration Concedes S&amp;L Bailout Will be More Expensive Than
Estimated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration conceded today that
the savings-and-loan bailout will cost taxpayers more than
previously estimated.
   ``There's no question that the cost is increasing and we'll have
to take that into account in deciding future actions,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   His comments were in response to Friday's report by the General
Accounting Office _ an investigatory arm of Congress _ that the
10-year cost of the program would be $243 billion instead of the
$166 billion estimated by the administration.
   Furthermore, the GAO said, the 30-year cost of the program could
reach $325 billion.
   ``We don't have an analysis either to endorse or reject the GAO
numbers, except to say there clearly is going to be additional
costs,'' Fitzwater said. ``Those numers will have to be decided
upon at some point.''
   Ftizwater rejected as ``total nonsense'' the contention by
Charles Bowsher, the GAO's comptroller general, that the
administration had deliberately understated the cost of the bailout.
   Bowsher, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said the Bush
administration had set an artifically low cost on the bailout so
the government could appear to meet deficit-reduction targets.
   Fitzwater said the Resolution Trust Co., set up to oversee the
restructuring of the S&amp;L industry, had so far used about $10
billion of the $50 billion it was provided under that original
bailout legislation signed by Bush last summer.
   ``The best thing to do, we believe, is to work speedily with the
funds and the progress we now have in place,'' the spokesman said.
   ``At this time there is not enough information to make a
reliable estimate of how much more may be required. Many factors
will determine if we need more funds _ including loss ratios,
interest rates, asset sales, et cetera,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked if the net effect would be an increase in the federal
deficit, Fitzwater said: ``There is always that consequence. If you
have to increase amounts, you have a responding impact on the
deficit and budgetary considerations.''
   Bowsher has said that the extra cost of the S&amp;L bailout is so
substantial that a tax increase will be needed.
   Economists have said for some time that the rescue plan would
cost more than the administration estimated.

   Ron Haugen's view of partisan politics is
pretty flexible, so he served as a delegate to both the Republican
and Democratic state conventions over the weekend.
   ``I didn't really know what party I liked so I thought I'd go to
both conventions and see,'' the 29-year old Northwood farmer said
Sunday from the floor of the Democratic convention.
   Haugen was a bit embarrassed when reporters noticed him at both
conventions. ``Is it illegal?'' he asked. ``I don't want any
publicity.''
   He said he attended the Democratic convention in legislative
District 19, a Republican stronghold.
   ``In our district if you can crawl through the door you're a
delegate,'' he said of the Democrats. The district was allowed to
send 23 delegates to the state convention but could muster only
eight, he noted.
   He didn't attend the Republicans' district convention but was
selected as a delegate to the state meeting anyway, he said.
   Republican state Rep. Dagne Olsen of Larimore said District 19
Republicans weren't aware Haugen also would be a delegate to the
Democrats' convention.
   Olsen said she didn't think party rules even addressed the
question of whether Haugen's double duty was allowed.
   ``But I don't think he should make it a habit,'' she said.
   Haugen said he'll study the platforms of each party before
deciding which he likes best.
   ``But I don't know,'' he added. ``I'll probably forget about
politics next year.''

   Exxon announced today that it would
plead innocent to a five-count criminal indictment charging it with
negligence and other crimes in the nation's worst oil spill a year
ago.
   The grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez ``was tragic, but it
was an accident,'' the company said in a prepared statement
announcing its intended plea.
   Exxon and its subsidiary Exxon Shipping Co. were scheduled for
separate arraignments before a federal magistrate later in the day.
   On Feb. 27, a federal grand jury handed up a five-count criminal
indictment against the company stemming from the oil spill, which
occurred after the Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef on
March 24, 1989, in Prince William Sound.
   The spill of nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil
coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed uncounted numbers
of fish, birds and other marine life.
   Exxon said it would vigorously defend itself against the
charges, which include violating clean water and refuse acts, and
negligently and unlawfully discharging oil into a navigable
waterway.
   ``We have said that from the beginning because nobody willfully
grounded the ship or caused the spill. We believe the conclusion is
thoroughly supported by the testimony and the verdict in the trial
of Capt. Hazelwood,'' the statement said.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, the Exxon Valdez skipper, was convicted
last month on a single charge of negligently discharging oil but
was acquitted on three other counts.
   More than 160 civil suits are pending against Exxon by the state
of Alaska, environmentalists and private individuals.

<HEAD>Dole Says Assad Seeking Hostage Releases; Group Says it Will Free

<TEXT>
   Senate minority leader Robert Dole said
Monday that Syrian President Hafez Assad is making efforts to
obtain the release of Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Also Monday, the Abu Nidal terrorist group said it would free
three European hostages this month. It also linked freedom for four
Belgians it holds to freedom for a Palestinian terrorist jailed in
Belgium.
   Before flying to Cairo, Dole and five Senate colleagues met with
Assad in Damascus for what the Kansas Republican called ``frank and
contructive'' talks on the situation in Lebanon, the hostages, and
means of achieving peace in the Middle East.
   Dole said Assad was making efforts ``to obtain the hostages'
release,'' but he did not give details. Syria has good relations
with Iran, which has influence with the hostage-holders.
   The Senate delegation, on a tour of the Middle East, is
scheduled to meet Tuesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
   Syria has repeatedly said it would like the 18 Westerners held
in Lebanon to be freed and has assisted with hostage releases in
the past. Many of the captives are believed held by pro-Iranian
Shiite Moslem groups.
   The Westerners missing in Lebanon are eight Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped in west
Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Most of the others have been held at least three years.
   Dole also said his group asked for Syria's assistance in
recovering the remains of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, an American
serving with a U.N. peacekeeping force who was kidnapped in south
Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.
   The Shiite Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed July
31, 1989, that it killed Higgins in retaliation for Israel's
kidnapping of a Shiite leader, Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, in south
Lebanon three days earlier.
   The group released a videotape showing a body on a gallows, but
U.S. officials believe Higgins was killed, or died, months earlier.
   The other five senators are Republican whip Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Republicans Jim McClure of
Idaho, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Frank Murkowski of Alaska.
   After Cairo, the delegation is scheduled to visit Israel and
Jordan.
   In Beirut, meanwhile, Belgian envoy Jan Hollants van Loocke said
Monday he was negotiating with Palestinian guerrillas led by
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal for the release of Belgians held by
the group.
   Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council says it holds seven
hostages, who were seized aboard a yacht in November 1987. Their
wherabouts is not known, and they are not counted among the
hostages held in Lebanon.
   Walid Khaled, spokesman for the Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
said three of the captives will be released by the end of the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan. Ramadan is expected to end around
April 26, depending on when the new moon is sighted.
   Khaled listed the three to be released as French hostage
Jacqueline Valente, 32, her Belgian boyfriend Ferdinand Houtekins,
in his 40s, and their 2-year-old daughter Sophie who was born in
captivity.
   Van Loocke, director-general for political affairs at Belgium's
Foreign Ministry, spoke to reporters later at Khaled's office.
   ``Of course it's true that one of the points we have been
discussing is the release of Nasser Sa'eed, who is in prison in
Belgium,'' said van Loocke.
   Earlier, Khaled said that freeing Sa'eed is a ``basic demand''
for the resumption of negotiations related to the release of four
Belgians also held by Abu Nidal.
   Sa'eed, a Palestinian, received a life sentence for a June 27,
1980 attack on Jewish youths in Antwerp, Belgium, that killed a
15-year-old and injured 20 other people.

   A capacity crowd at Boston's venerable Fenway Park cheered today
as Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens fired the first pitch of the 1990
baseball season, which began a week late because of a monthlong
lockout by its owners.
   No bitterness was evident in the stands, where fans seemed to
take a better-late-than-never attitude.
   ``People forgive them,'' said one Boston fan, William Cullen of
Cherry Valley, Mass. ``We're Americans. You love a thing, you're
going to go.''
   Toni Giamatti, widow of the late baseball Commissioner A.
Bartlett Giamatti, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway,
where the Red Sox faced the Detroit Tigers.
   A few minutes later, Giamatti's successor as commissioner, Fay
Vincent, threw out the ball at New York's Shea Stadium before the
Mets took on the Pittsburgh Pirates. Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden
followed with the first real pitch of the game _ like Clemens, he
threw a strike.
   There was no game in Cincinnati, marking just the third time
since 1876 the Reds have opened on the road. Because of the revised
schedules due to the season's delay, the Reds play tonight in
Houston, where the Astrodome is celebrating its 25th anniiversary.
   ``We're not going to be at home, so it's not going to be as big
a deal,'' Cincinnati's Tom Browning said. ``The crowd's not going
to be part of the hoopla.''
   In Chicago, the Cubs and White Sox were each home today. The
White Sox, starting their last season at Comiskey Park, played
Milwaukee, and the Cubs faced Philadelphia in the first night
opener at Wrigley Field.
   The Oakland Athletics, trying to become the first World Series

<HEAD>Company Replaces Push-Button Phones With Rotary Dials to Fight
Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone company is taking a
technological leap backward in an effort to fight the drug problem.
   U S West has replaced push-button pay phones with rotary models
at about 18 Twin Cities locations to make it harder for drug
dealers to conduct business with telephone pagers, U S West
spokesman Mike Breda said.
   Because most pagers don't work unless the call comes from a
push-button phone, drug dealers with pagers can't use the rotary
phones.
   Pagers have become a way of life for dealers, who often fear
their telephone lines are tapped.
   ``Everybody's got them,'' Lt. James Singer of the St. Paul
police narcotics unit said of the pagers.
   Customers order drugs by telephoning a dealer's pager and then
punching in a phone number or a pre-arranged code, police say. The
dealer responds by calling back or showing up with the drugs.
   In the past, Minneapolis and St. Paul police regularly asked the
telephone company to remove pay phones in drug-infested areas or to
adjust the phones so they don't accept incoming calls. But removing
public phones can hurt people who can't afford private telephones.
   ``We have noticed a decrease in traffic in at least a couple of
locations where we changed the phones,'' said Minneapolis Council
member Jackie Cherryhomes. ``I don't think it is going to win the
battle against drugs, but if you can affect it in any way, that's
important.''
   However, U S West's tactic may not work for long. At least one
paging company now offers a pager in which the caller can use any
phone.
   At least one paging company has taken steps to try to halt the
use of pagers for illegal purposes, said Steven Miorana, general
manager of MinnComm Paging in Minneapolis.
   A typical drug dealer will receive more than 1,000 pages per
month, he said. MinnComm now charges an extra 20 cents per call
after 500 calls to discourage excessive use, he said.

<HEAD>Peres Predicts Palestinian Uprising Will Wilt Under Labor</HEAD>

   Labor Party leader Shimon Peres predicted
Monday that the 28-month-old Palestinian uprising will wane once
his party leads the government into a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
   Peres also predicted the Soviet Union would upgrade ties with
Israel and allow direct Moscow-Tel Aviv flights to spee up Jewish
emigration.
   Peres' comments appeared in two Hebrew-language newspapers as
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc was
making intensive last-ditch efforts to block his road to power.
   Shamir was wooing defectors in advance of a Wednesday
parliamentary vote on Peres' confirmation.
   Peres told the Al Hamishmar daily that once his government is
installed, Israel will approve proposals by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III for an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in Cairo.
   Peres' support for Baker's ideas toppled the Labor-Likud
coalition government March 15, when Shamir lost a vote of
confidence in the parliament. He had refused to agree to the U.S.
proposals.
   Baker's plan was aimed at bridging differences between Israel
and the PLO over an Israeli proposal to hold elections in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The 1.7 million Palestinians
would choose representatives to negotiate an interim agreement.
   Peres told the mass-circulation Yediot Ahronot, ``I estimate
that the intefadeh (uprising) will ... wane and that millions of
shekels in the state budget can be diverted to constructive tasks.
   ``I can already foresee the fruits of opening peace
negotiations,'' he added. ``Relations will be renewed with the
Soviet Union ... in a matter of weeks.''
   The Kremlin broke ties with Israel during the 1967 Middle East
War. The two established low-level consular relations in 1987.
   The uprising has resulted in the death of 673 Palestinians from
Israeli gunfire and 43 Israeli deaths as a result of Arab violence.
   In addition, it has cost Israel nearly $1 billion in added
military costs and lost tourist revenue.
   ``I want to solve the problem of the residents of (these)
territories. It is our main burden,'' Peres told Al Hamishmar.
``The whole world is moving toward elections. Why not for the
Palestinians?''
   Peres indicated he planned no change in Israel's policy of
refusing to speak to the PLO, but he appeared to leave room for
some indirect PLO involvement in the negotiations.
   ``There is a Palestinian side for negotiations. I don't
understand why we should go beyond that,'' Peres told Al Hamishmar.
   Peres said he had no immediate plans to change Israel's
electoral system, despite a weekend rally at which more than
100,000 Israelis demanded election laws to counter the wheeling and
dealing that has characterized the government-building process.
   ``I want to change the system but not now,'' Peres told Yediot
Ahronot, adding ``Peace is no less important.''

<TEXT>
   The start of Raymond Buckey's second trial in
the McMartin preschool molestation case was abruptly postponed
today after his lawyer called in sick.
   Attorney Danny Davis had complained earlier of back trouble and
asked last week for the appointment of an assistant counsel to help
in case he was incapacitated.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg took no action on the
matter then. After Davis failed to appear today, Weisberg met in
chambers with prosecutors and an attorney who accompanied Buckey to
the courthouse.
   Buckey said the attorney, John Wagner, was seeking appointment
as Davis' co-counsel. Wagner previously represented Buckey's
sister, Peggy Ann, and is familiar with the McMartin case.
   Jury selection had been scheduled to begin today in what
promises to be another emotionally charged trial involving the
31-year-old Buckey.
   Buckey and Davis were among the few familiar faces in court
today. The prosecutors and judge in the first marathon trial have
been replaced. And one of the original defendants is missing. Peggy
McMartin Buckey, Raymond's mother, was acquitted of all charges
Jan. 18.
   Buckey was acquitted of most of the molestation charges against
him, but District Attorney Ira Reiner decided to retry eight counts
on which the jury deadlocked.
   Critics have accused Reiner of yielding to pressure from
McMartin parents and their supporters, who carried on a loud
campaign for a retrial. Reiner, who is running for California
attorney general, has denied any political motivations.
   The first trial of Buckey and his mother lasted nearly three
years and cost $13 million _ the longest, costliest criminal trial
in U.S. history.
   Initially, Reiner planned to retry Buckey on all 13 charges on
which the jury could not reach a decision. But last month he
dismissed five counts considered difficult to prove.
   The eight remaining charges involve three children, dramatically
fewer than the hundreds once described as alleged McMartin
molestation victims.
   ``The case is nothing more than a rehash of a case that was
slanted for acquittal before,'' Buckey said outside a pretrial
hearing last week. He called it ``a political maneuver'' and said
it would be ``a mental, physical and spiritual grind'' for him to
go through another trial.
   His lawyer, Davis, said: ``I've tried this case once before and
it didn't stand. I don't expect this to be any different.''
   The new chief prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Joe Martinez,
said he expects at least one thing to be different _ the trial's
length.
   With far fewer charges and only one defendant, Martinez said he
thinks the case could wrap up in six months.
   ``It all depends on how well the judge controls the procedure,''
he said, suggesting that Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg
limit cross-examination by the defense to avoid the witness-stand
marathons that marked the first case.
   In the trial that ended in January, Buckey, and his 63-year-old
mother had been accused of molesting 11 children at their Manhattan
Beach preschool during a five-year period. Jurors acquitted them of
52 molestation counts but deadlocked on the 13 charges against
Buckey.
   That trial was the culmination of a case that began in 1983.
Prosecutors alleged that Buckey, his mother, sister, grandmother
and three other teachers molested hundreds of tots at the nursery
school. There were accounts of satanic rites and animals tortured
to frighten the youngsters into silence.
   But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges were dropped
against five defendants after Reiner concluded the evidence was
weak.
   When Buckey and his mother came to trial in 1987, the
prosecution case had been pruned from hundreds of counts of child
molestation to 64 counts and a shared count of conspiracy. The 41
children once said to have been abused came down to 11 alleged
victims.
   It was a rancorous trial, and when it ended Superior Court Judge
William Pounders was barred from presiding at the retrial because
of his comments on TV talk shows after the verdict. Deputy District
Attorneys Lael Rubin and Roger Gunson bowed out at their own
request.
   Martinez and Deputy District Attorney Pam Ferrero replaced them.
Weisberg stepped into Pounders' role.

<HEAD>Bank Official Called `Satchel Man' for Imelda</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former bank official said Monday that he was
called ``the satchel man'' for Imelda Marcos because he carried
$100,000 cash for her expenses during the funeral of South Korean
President Park Chung-Hee in 1979.
   Oscar ``Oca'' Carino, who managed the Philippine National Bank's
New York branch from 1973 to 1984, said he was asked to accompany
Mrs. Marcos on the trip by her personal secretary, Fe Roa Jimenez,
who told him to bring the cash.
   He said he closely guarded the money, even keeping the bag
between his feet on the airplane. ``Of course, I never let it out
of my sight.''
   ``That's why people in Korea referred to me as the satchel
man,'' Carino said during his third day on the witness stand at
Mrs. Marcos' fraud trial.
   He said Mrs. Marcos gave $14,000 _ in bundles of $1,000 _ to the
wives of Filipino generals also attending Park's funeral.
   The prosecution alleges that Mrs. Marcos, the former Philippine
first lady, used the PNB as her ``personal piggy bank.'' In earlier
testimony, Carino told of providing millions of dollars from the
government-owned bank to finance Mrs. Marcos' frequent visits to
New York between 1973 and 1984.
   The former bank manager also said he asked Mrs. Marcos' close
friend, Gliceria Tantoco, why President Ferdinand E. Marcos bought
a Manhattan office building in 1981 after first deciding against
the purchase.
   ``I asked Mrs. Tantoco what happened that the decision not to go
ahead was reversed ... was Mrs. Marcos extra nice to the
president?''
   Carino said Mrs. Tantoco replied, ``She cried to him and told
the president to give the building to her as an inheritance or
gift.''
   The Crown Building on Fifth Avenue is one of four properties the
government charges the Marcoses purchased with more than $160
million stolen from the Philippine treasury.
   Mrs. Marcos' lawyer, Gerald Spence, questioning Carino's
testimony about his conversation with Mrs. Tantoco, elicited that
Carino never confirmed Mrs. Tantoco's statements.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. Her
husband also was charged in the 1988 indictment but died in exile
in Hawaii last September.
   Mrs. Tantoco, the owner of Rustans department store in the
Philippines, and her husband, Bienvenido, the former Philippine
ambassador to the Vatican, also were charged but are fugitives.
   A co-defendant, Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, is
accused of mail fraud and obstruction of justice for allegedly
helping the Marcoses hide their ownership of the Manhattan
properties.
   After Monday, the trial will recess until April 17 because of
the Passover and Easter holidays.

<HEAD>NBC Loads Up New Saturday Morning Season With Live-Action Shows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC, facing Saturday kid-show competition from
cable as well as syndicated series, unveiled a fall schedule on
Monday that includes what the network says is the most live-action
Saturday programming in its history.
   The new roster moves NBC away from the traditional cartoons that
for years have been a staple of Saturday morning network shows for
children.
   NBC, which trails ABC by a full ratings point in Saturday
morning ratings to date for this season, said its new lineup has
two hours of shows with no animation and one hour of shows that mix
animation with human characters.
   The latter includes its new rap music comedy, ``Kid `n' Play.''
ABC has a similar rap music show set for next fall, ``The New Kids
on the Block,'' starring the rock group of the same name.
   NBC's schedule, which one NBC official said was designed ``to
reach the kids of the 90s,'' was shown at a meeting of advertising
agency officials here.
   The network's shift from cartoons comes at a time when the three
major networks, in addition to cable and syndicated competition,
also face a three-hour Saturday morning schedule that the Fox
network will start next fall.
   NBC, which began its move from cartoons this season with a new
sitcom for kids, ``Saved by the Bell,'' has five new series on its
Saturday morning schedule for next fall, compared to three on ABC.
   CBS, currently third in Saturday morning ratings as well as in
prime time and in morning programs, will unveil its fall childrens'
schedule Tuesday.
   NBC's new live-action lineup includes a sports show for
teen-agers and older viewers, ``Inside Stuff: The Entertainment
Magazine of the NBA.'' It will premiere Oct. 27 and lead into NBC's
National Basketball Association broadcasts.
   The other new live-action series are ``The Boys Next Door,'' a
variety series ``secretly'' broadcast by five teen-agers from the
basement of their home in Encino, Calif., and ``Saturday Videos,''
a childrens' version of NBC's pop-culture ``Friday Night Videos.''
   NBC's new cartoon series include ``Rick Moranis in Graveyard
High,'' which features the voice and cartoon face of the star of
``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.'' The show is about a kindly teacher at
a school where the students are literally monsters.
   Although parents may think of the networks' Saturday battles as
kid stuff, NBC sales vice president Ron Dobson told advertising
executives Monday that the influence of children on their parents'
spending is estimated to be worth $70 billion annually.
   According to Betsy Frank, a senior vice president of Saatchi and
Saatchi Advertising, advertisers spent $189 million in 1989 on the
networks' Saturday childrens' shows.
   That's only a fraction of the $4.8 billion they spent on prime
time network shows, she said, but Saturday morning in TV ``has
become intensely competitive'' because of syndicated and cable
programs for children.
   ``That's why we're seeing more players getting into it.''

   Colombian President Virgilio Barco told an
international drug conference Monday that drug barons are not
invincible, and he appealed to cocaine users to give up the habit
that has created havoc in his country.
   ``I should like to make an earnest plea to drug consumers to
realize that their habit is bringing our countries to the brink of
disaster, that their addiction is fostering violence, crime and
corruption throughout the world,'' Barco said at the start of a
three-day drug summit.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, the U.S. secretary of health, said an
international commitment to end the drug crisis would not only send
drug kingpins a message that ``their days are numbered,'' but also
would send ``a message to users that they bear responsibility in
perpetuating the drug problem.''
   ``We must communicate to users that help is available to them
but that they must seek it,'' he said.
   Up to 10 million cocaine users in the United States spend
approximately $20 billion to $25 billion per year on cocaine _
roughly equivalent to the gross national products of Colombia, Peru
or Bolivia, according to a report produced by the Panos Institute.
It is a non-profit international development organization.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told the
conference that the world traffic in illicit drugs amounts to about
$500 billion a year, ranking just behind the arms trade.
   ``It is a sad commentary on the state of mankind at the end of
the 20th century (that) the bulk of our vast productive energies is
devoted to manufacturing our own destruction,'' Perez de Cuellar
said.
   He added that conservative estimates put the number of illicit
drug users at more than 40 million worldwide.
   The meeting _ formally called the World Ministerial Drugs Summit
to Reduce the Demand for Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat _
was called by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. It is being
sponsored by Britain and the United Nations.
   ``Our efforts to reduce production of drugs and to prevent
traffic in them can never succeed while demand for drugs is still
there,'' Mrs. Thatcher told the more than 800 ministers and
delegates from 112 nations.
   She said Britain would set up task forces to train customs
agents and officials fighting drug trafficking and to assist
developing countries with drug education. She said Britain would
contribute $7.3 million more to help Colombia battle its powerful
cocaine cartels.
   Barco, whose anti-drug efforts have made him a target for South
American drug barons, arrived at London's Queen Elizabeth II
Conference Center under heavy security.
   He said authorities now understand that to break the noose of
drugs, they must deal not only with the drug barons, but with the
peasants who produce coca leaves; the large companies manufacturing
processing chemicals; the transporters; those who conceal drugs in
warehouses; and the banks that launder drug money.
   ``We are contending with an international criminal organization
acknowledging no frontiers,'' Barco said.
   But, he added, ``The fight in which Colombia is engaged reveals
that the drug barons are not invincible. They are not untouchable.
... The myth that the drug barons are stronger than the state or
society is only that, a myth.''
   Colombia has extradited 15 drug suspects to the United States
since its crackdown began in August, and one of the Medellin
cartel's leaders, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was shot to death by
drug agents in December.
   Italy's Interior Minister Antonio Gava, quoting figures provided
by the international police agency Interpol, said cocaine seizures
in Europe had increased from 3,300 pounds in 1986 to 13,860 pounds
in 1989.

   Ed Shea was talking on the phone in his
shop when a customer walked in, turned around and fled without a
word.
   Shea looked over his shoulder and saw the reason the man had
bolted. There was a 7-foot alligator in the shop.
   ``At first I thought it was plastic and that someone was just
trying to scare ... me,'' said the 43-year-old proprietor of
National Floor Care Products.
   When he realized the gator was real he called the Florida Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commission. The univited guest just sat there
for the 20 minutes it took for the wildlife officials to arrive.
   But when the trappers slipped a noose on the gator it turned
ornery, flipping boxes, upending chairs and attacking a vacuum. It
clenched the appliance's cord in its teeth.
   Mike Fagan, a wildlife official, figures the 125-pound gator
wandered in a back door Saturday from a nearby pond in search of
food.
   ``I've only been here a year and a half, and the last thing I
would have thought was that there would be an alligator sitting
behind me in my shop,'' said Shea, who moved to this rural
community 40 miles north of Tampa from Plymouth, Mass.

<TEXT>
   A man infatuated with another man's
bride-to-be was jailed after he interrupted a marriage ceremony
armed with a toy gun and wearing a cape and black mask, police said
Monday.
   James M. Jernigan showed up outside Our Lady of Good Counsel
Roman Catholic Church just before the wedding on Saturday holding a
cap gun and wearing a big cowboy hat, a white poncho and a mask.
   He threatened the bride, 28-year-old Teresa Parker, and her
groom, David Bennett, and panicked guests fled, Police Chief Steve
Sheppard said.
   ``He pointed a firearm at several people including police,'' the
chief said. ``He was just trying to disrupt the wedding because he
was infatuated with Miss Parker.''
   Sheppard said the groom's relatives swept him away ``to keep him
from getting upset and retaliating'' when Jernigan arrived outside
the church,
   The bride's father, James Parker, said Jernigan had worked for
six weeks in an office where his daughter was a manager. Parker
refused to identify the office.
   The Rev. Joseph Maher, who officiated the marriage, said he was
inside and missed the confrontation.
   ``The wedding itself went off beautifully,'' he said. ``I
imagine they were quite nervous, but it didn't show that much.''
   Jernigan, 30, of Isle of Palms, was charged with resisting
arrest with deadly force, presenting and pointing a firearm,
disturbance of religious worship and assaulting police while
resisting arrest.
   Sheppard said police discovered the weapon was only a cap gun
after Jernigan was arrested. He was in jail Monday in lieu of
$35,000 bond.

   NASA said there was only a 40
percent chance that weather would delay Tuesday's launch of the
space shuttle Discovery on its mission to place a telescope in
orbit to look toward the edge of the universe.
   Launch of the 35th shuttle mission from Kennedy Space Center was
set for 8:47 a.m. EDT. There was a chance that low clouds could
push that time back.
   Once in orbit, the Hubble Space Telescope, 43 feet long, 14 feet
in diameter and weighing 24,250 pounds, will be lifted out of
Discovery's cargo bay with the ship's mechanical arm, given an
exacting checkout, and will be dropped overboard Wednesday
afternoon if all goes well.
   The telescope, being launched seven years late because of the
1986 Challenger accident and technical problems, represents an
investment of more than $2 billion _ $1.5 billion for the telescope
itself and $600 million for spare parts, astronaut training and
ground support. It will cost $200 million a year to operate and
maintain.
   The flight is deemed so important that all five of the crew are
veterans of previous flights. Commander Loren J. Shriver and pilot
Charles F. Bolden each have flown once before.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn D. Sullivan
not only have flown before but also have space-walking experience.
They'll be ready to make space walks to rectify any problems with
the telescope. And mission specialist Steven A. Hawley, whose job
it is to operate the mechanical arm that lifts the telescope out,
has two missions under his belt.
   The telescope's 94-inch mirror, according to experts, is the
most flawless ever made. It was designed to capture and magnify
light from nearly the farthest reaches of the universe _ light
created billions of years ago when stars and solar systems were in
their earliest stages of formation.
   ``Hubble has no rivals,'' said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief
scientist. ``Never before have we had a telescope or observatory
with this capability, and it will not be surpassed until we begin
to establish observatories on the moon some day.''
   Above the atmosphere, which distorts visible light and blocks
out ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays, the telescope will be able
to see objects 50 times dimmer than those that can be observed from
the ground.
   With this new tool, astronomers will see these celestial objects
as they were billions of years ago. That should help determine
whether the Big Bang that created the universe was 10 billion years
ago, 20 billion years ago or somewhere in between, as scientists
believe.
   Mostly, scientists stress, they expect to get answers to
questions they haven't asked.
   ``We have to be consciously expecting that we may be
surprised,'' said William Jeffreys of the University of Texas,
leader of the astrometry team, and one of 1,200 scientists who will
work with results from the Hubble's observations.
   In the 15-year life expected of the telescope, scientists hope
also to find planets around other stars.
   Engineers will spend about five months calibrating the
instrument once it is in orbit but the first photographs are
expected within two weeks of launch.
   ``I think we have an obligation as soon as it's available to put
out a picture that shows this is really the fantastic device we
expect it to be,'' Fisk told reporters. The picture will most
likely be of an object or objects for which good ground-based
images are available as a basis for comparison.
   Astronomers gathered at the Kennedy Space Center as if for a
convention. So did nearly 200 relatives of astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who died in 1953.
   In the 1920s, Hubble discovered that the universe is organized
into galaxies of many sizes and shapes and that they are rushing
away from one another.
   His idea of an expanding universe gave support to the theory
that the universe was created by an explosion.

   Soviet Jewish immigrants
celebrated their first Passover in this Jewish settlement Monday,
marking their ancestors' release from slavery in ancient Egypt and
the modern exodus from the Soviet Union.
   ``I see similarities between the Passover story and the Russian
immigration,'' said Suzanna Eisenvarg, 38. She was among 130 new
immigrants who joined with settlers for a Passover meal in the
elementary school gymnasium.
   ``It's delicious,'' Ms. Eisenvarg said as she tried the
chorosot, a pate of apple, nuts and wine which represents the
mortar that the Jews used to build pyramids for Egyptian pharaohs.
   She recalled that in Leningrad, ``we brought matzo from the
synagogue. We would just eat matzo on that night, somehow we knew
the date, the date that Israelites left Egypt,'' she said.
   As she spoke, Rabbi Boris Yussin, a Russian immigrant who lives
in Jerusalem, translated the Hebrew story into Russian while
Israelis took turns reading from the Hagada, which tells the story
of the Jews' flight from Egypt.
   Mrs. Eisenvarg is one of about 250 Soviet Jews living in the
occupied West Bank, a little less than 1 percent of the 29,000
immigrants who arrived in 1989 and the first three months of 1990.
   The pace is apparently quickening. Soviet Jewish immigration
activist Natan Sharansky estimated the total for this year at
200,000.
   The presence of Soviet Jews in the occupied lands has
complicated the exodus by sparking criticism from the United States
and galvanizing an Arab campaign against all Soviet immigration.
   Mrs. Eisenvarg and other new arrivals said they settled in Ariel
because, unlike Israel, apartments were plentiful and cheap. None
cited ideological reasons for being in Ariel, a settlement of about
8,000 people in the heart of the West Bank.
   Ariel's mayor, Ron Nachman, said the recent arrivals had been
calling relatives in Moscow and Leningrad urging them to come and
settle in Ariel.
   He said that with the U.S. policy against settlements in the
occupied lands, ``we have to push as much as possible for them to
come here.''
   He said Israel will weather the protests over the settlement of
Jews in the war-won land.
   ``There was a pharaoh in Egypt, and we got through that, and we
will get through this too. This immigration is a miracle,'' he said.
   Reuven Rosenthal, 34, came to Ariel eight months ago with his
wife and two children. ``It's a nice pretty place with good cheap
prices,'' said Rosenthal.
   He said he was not concerned about the frequent clashes between
Jewish settlers and Palestinian activists at his doorstep. ``What
should I be afraid of? In the Soviet Union, there is much more fear
of anti-Semitism,'' he said.
   The gymnasium was decorated with yellow, blue and purple
streamers. Passover ingredients, such as eggs, apples, wine, nutmeg
and horseradish, covered the yellow cloth-covered round tables.
   For most Soviet Jews, who have been cut off from Jewish
traditions all their lives, this marked the first time they
participated in a Seder, or Passover dinner.
   Passover is one of the most important holidays in the Jewish
calendar.
   During the meal, held on the first evening of the holiday, Jews
eat food symbolizing the Passover themes of redemption and freedom
and read the story of the exodus from Egypt. One key ingredient is
matzo, or unleavened bread, symbolizing the haste with which the
Jews had to leave Egypt.
   While the Soviet immigrants in Ariel celebrated their
homecoming, their presence in the West Bank continues to strain
relations between Israel and the rest of the world.
   U.S. officials say settling immigrants in the occupied lands and
Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem raises obstacles to peace. Last
month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested Washington
withhold special financial aid for immigrant absorption until
Israel pledged not to settle Soviet Jews in the occupied lands.
   Arab and PLO leaders fear that the expected arrival of about
750,000 Soviet Jews in this decade will cause more suffering to the
Palestinians. They claim that Palestinians will eventually be
ousted from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to make room for new
arrivals from the Soviet Union.
   In response to the Arab campaign, the Soviet Union has refused
to ratify an agreement with Israel for direct Moscow-Tel Aviv
flights that would expedite Jewish emigration. Soviet Jews now
arrive in Israel via Eastern European transit points. There are
long waits for a limited number of seats.

   People smeared their faces with
ceremonial red dust and burst firecrackers Monday in nationwide
jubilation over the king's promise to re-establish a multiparty
system in Nepal.
   A left-wing radical group said Sunday's agreement between King
Birendra and the leaders of a seven-week campaign for democracy did
not go far enough. It pledged to continue the movement, using
violence if necessary.
   Before a curfew was lifted Monday, reports said troops shot and
killed at least two people.
   After curfew, hundreds of thousands of people marched through
Katmandu and a half-dozen other towns in the Himalayan kingdom to
celebrate the agreement, clinched by the Nepali Congress party and
the United Left Front. The Front is a coalition of left-wing
parties.
   Laughing, whistling, clapping and chanting ``Victory! Victory!''
people wound their way through the streets on foot, cars,
motor-powered rickshaws and tractors.
   ``Democracy, democracy, we have now democracy!'' a man shouted
in English into a megaphone. Boys with hand-scrawled ``I love
democracy'' posters pinned on their backs zipped around on bicycles.
   ``Today we will celebrate our freedom. We have no definite plan,
but we only want to express our joy,'' said Yagya Nidhi Duhal, his
face smeared with red powder used by Nepalese during celebrations.
   Most other marchers, including several Western tourists, wore
powder marks on their foreheads.
   On Sunday, Birendra announced he was lifting a 29-year-old ban
on political parties that has kept the Rashtriya Panchayat, or
national assembly, non-partisan and allowed the king to rule
through a largely rubber-stamp government.
   The announcement came two days after the bloodiest day in modern
Nepalese history. Witnesses said as many as 200 people were killed
when security forces opened fire to prevent pro-democracy
demonstrators from marching to the king's palace Friday. The
government said 10 people were killed and 107 injured in nationwide
violence that day.
   Immediately after the royal proclamation, the Nepali Congress
party and the United Left Front said they were suspending their
movement.
   But the United National People's Movement, a radical group that
was supporting the pro-democracy campaign, said Monday the
agreement to ``withdraw the current movement, without abolishing
the present Panchayat constitution ... is definitely a betrayal to
the people.
   ``We will continue the movement until we achieve more. We won't
propagate violence but we also do not rule it out,'' said party
spokesman Babu Ram Bhattarai.
   Bhattarai said ``the very fact that they want to amend the
constitution and not form a new one means the king wants to remain
the decisive body.''
   The United People's Movement is not considered a major political
force, but political observers say it commands a sizeable following
in some towns.
   Prime Minister Lokendra Chand told reporters Monday a commission
will amend the constitution to fulfill the king's promise of
``pluralistic democracy.''
   Oblivious of the first signs of dissent among the movement
leaders, people celebrated the royal proclamation into the night,
lighting oil lamps, candles and electric bulbs around their houses.
   Celebrations began at dawn Monday when a two-day curfew was
lifted in Katmandu and two suburbs, Patan and Bhaktapur. Tens of
thousands of residents streamed out of their homes and marched
through the main intersections and the narrow sidestreets.
   Sources in the Nepali Congress party said similar processions
were also staged in at least a half-dozen other towns in the
mountainous kingdom wedged between India and China.
   Amid the joy, relatives wept at two hospitals to mourn the
deaths of a man and a 12-year-old boy, shot late Sunday shortly
after the king yielded to demonstrators.
   Doctors at Bir Hospital said five other people were being
treated for bullet wounds. The people who brought the injured to
the hospital said at least 10 other people were killed and their
bodies taken away by troops, according to the doctors who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The report could not be confirmed. Police denied there was any
firing.
   The government-run news agency RSS said one person was killed in
police firing at Bharatpur in central Nepal. The news agency did
not give details.
   Nepal last experiment with a Western-style democracy ended in
1961. Birendra's father, King Mahendra, dismissed the government,
which at that time was led by the Nepali Congress party. He accused
it of corruption and inefficiency and banned political parties.

<HEAD>Strong Conservative Showing Could be Start of Soviet Bloc Trend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters ended the Communist era by
giving a strong mandate to the country's main conservative party in
what could be the genesis of a center-right trend among Soviet bloc
countries emerging into democracy.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum campaigned on an anti-Communist
platform that incorporated universal conservative values as well as
a strong dose of nationalism. It scored an impressive victory in
parliamentary elections that wrapped up Sunday.
   It was the second win in two Soviet bloc elections for
conservative forces. In East Germany's March 18 vote, conservatives
fell just short of a majority in the first free national elections
in any Warsaw Pact country. As in Hungary, remnants of the
long-ruling Communists were relegated to a relatively minor
opposition role.
   Hungary's Democratic Forum captured 165 of the 386 seats at
stake Sunday. In the first round of balloting March 25, they won
42.75 percent of the vote.
   Despite preliminary predictions of a close race, the Forum left
the liberal League of Free Democrats far behind, with 92 seats and
23.83 percent of the vote, forcing the rival party to bury any
aspirations of sharing a government role.
   The ruling Socialists, created by reform Communists last
October, were sent packing. Despite their commitment to political
plurality, they captured only 33 seats or 8.55 percent of the vote,
victims of widespread sentiment that they were the heirs of decades
of repressive Communist rule.
   Its strong position left the Democratic Forum independent of any
party with which it had major differences. Instead, it gained the
leeway to negotiate a coalition it could dominate with the agrarian
Smallholders and Christian Democrats, which share many of its
conservative views.
   The Smallholders captured 11.14 percent of the vote and the
Christian Democrats were tied for fifth with 5.44 percent, meaning
a conservative coalition headed by the Democratic Forum would
control nearly 60 percent of the legislature.
   Conservatives in other East European countries preparing for the
first free elections in more than four decades clearly hope that
the same anti-Communist backlash that worked in favor of kindred
parties in East Germany and Hungary will also give them an edge.
   In Czechoslovakia, where voters go to the polls June 8, the hope
of victory has resulted in the Christian Democrats in Slovakia
forging an alliance with Czech center-rightists, despite a general
drifting apart of the two constituent republics. Only the
conservatives have managed to formally coordinate their election
strategies nationwide.
   The Slovak Christian Democrats, led by Czechoslovak Deputy
Premier Jan Carnogursky, are expected to win up to 60 percent of
the vote in their traditionally Catholic republic, and the
well-organized alliance is likely to finish strong overall in the
country, although no one can predict how strong.
   The election picture is confusing in Romania, where about 70
political parties have sprung up or been revived in the wake of the
December revolution that ended the dictatorship of Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   But the nation's strongest conservative force, the
700,000-member National Peasants' Party, is given the best chance
of defeating the National Salvation Front, which took control of
the country in the chaos of the revolution but was later forced to
share power. It is suspected by many conservatives of harboring
unrepentant Communists.
   The Peasants' hand has been strengthened by an election alliance
with the Liberals and Social Democrats _ the two other leading
parties. The alliance mandates cooperation up to the May 20
election, in an effort to defeat the National Salvation Front.
   In Bulgaria, the two traditional agrarian parties could pose the
biggest threat to the still-powerful Communist Party, but only if
they manage to bury differences ahead of election day June 10.
Negotiations on unification of the two parties continue.
   There was no clear conservative trend in Poland last June, when
voters participated in their freest election in more than four
decades. They endorsed Solidarity candidates sharing an
anti-Communist bent but no particular ideological platform.

<HEAD>Administration Will Send Already Appropriated Funds to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, suggesting Congress
is dragging its feet on aid for Central America, said Monday it
will spend $3.6 million in already appropriated funds to help the
peace process in Nicaragua.
   ``This is just a stopgap measure,'' said presidential press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The money, he said, will be used to help the U.S.-backed Contras
disband and resettle.
   The administration's $870 million aid package, bogged down in
Congress, included about $30 million for that purpose.
   ``We had hoped to get that passed before the (Easter) recess.
Congress chose to go home without acting on it. We'll push for it
as soon as they get back,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We are quite concerned about this,'' he said. ``We wanted to
foster demobilization and repatriation (of the Contras) as
expeditiously as possible.''
   The administration's original package included $500 million for
Panama, $300 million for Nicaragua and $70 million to enlarge
programs in the United States that benefit refugees.
   However, the House increased the package to $2.4 billion, adding
money U.S. projects including food stamps, disaster relief,
fighting forest fires and veterans programs. The Senate has yet to
act on the legislation.
   Fitzwater said the $3.6 million would come from what was left
over from an earlier $47 million humanitarian aid package for
Nicaragua.
   ``We believe that the money is needed there, that it is a worthy
cause, that the United States has pushed for this as the ultimate
goal of its policy for years, and that we do have a responsibility
to make this money available,'' Fitzwater said.
   The $30 million in the administration's package that would be
earmarked for repatriation includes $2 million to help finance a
United Nations observer group that will receive the weapons of
resistance members who demobilize.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called
the $3.6 million ``start up money for the repatriation and
resettlement operations,'' including money for the U.N. group.
   ``Both politically and financially'' the United States supports
the ``voluntary demobilization, repatriation and reintegration'' of
Contra rebels and their families, she said.
   She said both the U.N. and the Organization of American States
had been ``informed of our intention to move quickly to disperse
these dollars.''
   Administration officials said the government is prepared to
provide funds for food and medical care for the Contras, both in
Honduras and Nicaragua.
   The $3.6 million is the remaining amount from a Central American
humanitarian aid package approved by Congress last year to carry
out its bipartisan accord with the White House.

<HEAD>Dark Horse Candidate Sidetracks Vargas Llosa in Peru's
Presidential Race</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, once considered a
sure bet to become Peru's next president, has found himself
sidetracked by the ``Fujimori phenomenon.''
   Alberto Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants and a political
unknown until a month ago, forced the country's most famous
novelist into a runoff and is now favored to win the presidency.
   Public opinion analysts say Fujimori's strong second-place
finish in Sunday's election reflected Peruvians' alienation from
the traditional political parties and their desire for
``miraculous, painless'' solutions to the country's ills.
   ``It was not a rational vote. It was a protest vote against the
other candidates,'' said Alfredo Torres, media director for APOYO,
a market research firm.
   Fujimori, a 51-year-old agricultural engineer, received 29
percent of the vote Sunday to 33.9 percent for the 54-year-old
Vargas Llosa, according to unofficial returns. The writer needed a
majority of the votes cast to avoid a runoff, which now most likely
will take place in early June.
   Luis Alva Castro, candidate of the governing left-of-center
Aprista Party, received 16.4 percent. Two Marxist candidates
collected 11 percent of the vote between them. The remaining votes
were divided among four minor candidates and blank and void ballots.
   Official results will not be available for weeks. But the
unofficial results represented a slap in the face to Vargas Llosa,
who campaigned hard for two years and as late as mid-February had
more than 50 percent support in polls.
   Campaigning on a shoestring budget, Fujimori shot up from less
than 1 percent in polls six weeks ago to nearly surpass Vargas
Llosa.
   Vargas Llosa's campaign often seemed like a crusade. Running on
a free-market platform, he harshly attacked the ``collectivist''
programs of President Alan Garcia and the proposals of leftist
candidates.
   Many Peruvians blame Garcia for Peru's worst economic crisis of
the century and the growing political violence that is tearing
apart this Andean country of 22 million.
   Inflation is running at more than 2,000 percent annually. More
than 18,000 people, most of them civilians, have died violently in
a decade-long struggle between Shining Path guerrillas and security
forces.
   Vargas Llosa was asking for a clear mandate from Peruvians to
carry out radical reforms aimed at undoing two decades of socialist
policies he blames for Peru's stagnation.
   ``I have put aside my career because I think there is a real
chance to change the history of Peru,'' Vargas Llosa said in the
closing days of the campaign.
   Analysts say Peruvian voters, dismayed by two decades of
economic decline and falling living standards, were looking for
someone with ``magical'' solutions to the country's problems.
   The spotlight fell on Fujimori, they say, after voters in recent
weeks began to fear the economic shock therapy and harsh austerity
measures advocated by Vargas Llosa.
   ``No one likes to go to the dentist even when his tooth hurts.
And that's what Vargas Llosa offered,'' Manuel d'Ornellas, editor
of the Expreso newspaper, wrote in a column Monday.
   ``Terrified by the government's disgraceful propaganda campaign
against the so-called shock, many people have fled Vargas Llosa's
proposed surgery to take shelter in Fujimori's oriental nirvana,''
d'Ornellas said.
   Fujimori is an agronomist and former university rector. His
campaign has stressed ``honor, technology and work,'' qualities
many here associate with his Japanese ancestry. Peru has a large
number of people who trace their roots to Japanese immigrants.
   Public opinion analysts say Fujimori has awakened hopes in
voters that he will be able to attract massive Japanese aid and
investment if elected.
   The analysts say voters also were turned off by the
multimillion-dollar campaign waged by the center-right Democratic
Front coalition supporting Vargas Llosa.
   In contrast to Vargas Llosa, Fujimori adopted a conciliatory
style in his campaign. He also avoided spelling out what he would
do to resolve Peru's serious problems.
   Public opinion analysts agreed that unless Vargas Llosa changes
his strategy, he is almost certain to be defeated in the second
round by the ``Fujimori phenomenon.''
   Vargas Llosa is unlikely to receive support from the Aprista
Party or the defeated leftists, according to the analysts.
   Fujimori, on the other hand, has made few enemies.
   ``Because of the polarization that has been generated,'' he said
Sunday night, ``the left is not going to support the Democratic
Front.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq on Monday ordered a U.S. diplomat to
leave the country in retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of an Iraqi
envoy accused of involvement in a murder plot.
   The Foreign Ministry announcement, carried by the official Iraqi
news agency, did not name the American. The State Department in
Washington confirmed the expulsion but did not identify the
diplomat.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said of the expulsion: ``We
deplore Iraq's unjust action and believe it was totally
inappropriate.''
   Since the restoration of diplomatic ties in 1985, U.S. relations
with Iraq have been ``complex and sometimes disturbing,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``Iraq should understand that such actions (the
expulsion) only tend to exacerbate our relations.''
   The Iraqi news agency quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman
as saying the American action over the weekend was part of
``repeated hysterical campaigns to harm Iraq in order to serve the
aggressive purposes of Israel.''
   ``The accusation against the Iraqi diplomat has no basis in
truth,'' he said.
   The State Department said Saturday it expelled an unidentified
Iraqi diplomat posted at the United Nations because he was
suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to murder two opponents
of the Baghdad government.
   State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman on Saturday said the
department could only say that the expulsion was linked to an
investigation in California. U.S. government sources said on
condition of anonymity the expulsion involved a plot to assassinate
two Iraqi opposition members in the United States.
   A newspaper in California identified the targets of the plot as
Sargon Dadesho, a leader of the Assyrian community in California's
Central Valley, and an unidentified Kurdish leader. Kurds in Iraq
have been fighting for autonomy.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to their lowest level in a
month.
   The Treasury Department sold $8.2 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.80 percent, down from 7.83 percent
last week. Another $8.2 billion was sold in six-month bills at the
same average discount rate of 7.80 percent, down from 7.81 percent
last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.72
percent on Feb. 26., and six-month bills averaged 7.79 percent on
March 5.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.07 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,802.80 and 8.23 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,605.70.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 8.29
percent last week, down from 8.34 percent the previous week.

   The Fort Myers (Fla.) News-Press won the
Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards' $2,000 grand prize Monday for
``Far From the Dream,'' a 12-part series on the problems of blacks
in southwestern Florida.
   The News-Press, which also received a $1,000 first prize for
print journalism, was honored for its articles last year on
housing, education, economics, politics and other problems
affecting poor blacks.
   The awards committee said that as a result of the series, the
Lee County, Fla., school board took steps to hire more minority
teachers, the county director of public housing was suspended, and
the Justice Department and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund requested a
study of the county's desegregation policy of busing only black
children.
   The News-Press will receive its awards at a May 14 reception at
the suburban Virginia home of Ethel Kennedy, widow of the former
New York senator who was assassinated during his 1968 presidential
campaign. The awards, sponsored by the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial,
are given for outstanding coverage of the problems of disadvantaged
Americans.
   The first-prize winner in television was a team from WGBH, the
Boston public TV station, for ``The AIDS Quarterly With Peter
Jennings: Winter 1989.''
   National Public Radio won a first prize for ``Young Black Men:
Lost Generation?'' and Stormi Greener of the Minneapolis Star and
Tribune was awarded first prize in the photojournalism category.
   Paul Conrad of the Los Angeles Times won first prize for
cartoons. T. Jeff Rutherford of the University of Illinois won the
student first prize for a series on medicare.
   International awards went to CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' Sandy Tolan
and Jerry Kammer of The Arizona Republic in Phoenix, and Bruce
Chambers of the Press-Telegram in Long Beach, Calif.

   Sudden snags in talks to cut long-range
nuclear weapons won't affect plans for next month's superpower
summit between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the White House said Monday.
   ``We have a lot of things to talk about in our relationship
besides arms control,'' said White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   ``We are prepared to go ahead with the summit regardless of what
happens on the arms control part of it.''
   Problems in reaching an arms agreement aren't the only cloud
hanging over the summit. Bush has warned Moscow that a crackdown in
the secessionist republic of Lithuania would mar superpower
relations and threaten progress across the entire superpower agenda.
   Bush and Gorbachev are to meet in the United States for five
days, beginning May 30.
   The centerpiece of the second meeting between Bush and Gorbachev
was to have been the signing of an outline of a treaty to cut
strategic nuclear weapons.
   However, prospects for an agreement diminished last week after
the United States and Soviet Union reported little progress during
three days of high-level talks in Washington.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the two sides
remained at odds over air-launched and sea-launched cruise
missiles, which have long been a key obstacle to reaching a
strategic arms reduction treaty.
   U.S. officials said privately that the Soviet Union had pulled
back in some areas where the two sides previously agreed.
   Fitzwater said the Bush administration remained hopeful, as it
had during the first Bush-Gorbachev summit at Malta, that an
agreement could be reached in time for the summit.
   ``If the emphasis is on the word doable, which is the new word,
I think that there is certainly a great question whether or not
it's doable that we would have a treaty,'' he said.
   ``I think there's an open question about whether all major
points would be resolved at this time.''
   On the other hand, Fitzwater said it was not unusual that
problems crop up as negotiations approach a conclusion.
   ``As you get nearer the end, people get a little nervous and
start having second thoughts and trying to employ a little
last-minute advantage and so forth,'' Fitzwater said. ``Let's hope
that that's what it is and that we can resume progress.''
   Another attempt to break the arms deadlock will be made when
Baker goes to the Soviet Union for talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on May 16-19.
   Meanwhile, an adminstration official confirmed that Bush had
written to Gorbachev proposing a ban on all land-based strategic
missiles carrying multiple warheads.
   Gorbachev, in a response delivered Friday by Shevardnadze, said
the U.S. plan was too limited and should include sea-based missiles
as well as those deployed on land, said the official, who refused
to be identified.
   The U.S. and Soviet positions reflect the different ways the two
superpowers have structured their nuclear arsenals.
   The United States has deployed most of its nuclear warheads at
sea, while the Soviet Union has deployed most of its warheads on
land.
   Baker, at a news conference Friday, refused to discuss the issue
of multiple-warhead weapons.
   ``There are some things we just don't comment on, and
particularly if there's some chance that they are under
consideration as part of our negotiations,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Manufacturers Reject Voluntary Regulation, FDA Said</HEAD>

   Most manufacturers of cosmetics are not
signing up for voluntary federal oversight, according to a report
to Congress released Monday.
   A congressman who wants to increase oversight of the $18 billion
industry said the report raises safety questions.
   The Food and Drug Administration has no authority to require
safety testing of personal-care products, which includes everything
from toothpaste to bubble bath, or to force manufacturers to report
safety data or cosmetics-related injuries, noted the report by the
General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of Congress.
   ``Most people think somebody approves these products in advance
... that the government would have access to safety data, that
there's a review of the chemicals (in the products), but that's not
what goes on here,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who requested the
report, said in an interview.
   Wyden is chairman of the Small Business subcommittee on
regulation,
   He said the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, on the books since
1938, needs to be rewritten to require cosmetics manufacturers to
register with the FDA and provide the agency with data on safety
tests and injury reports. He said he expects to introduce
legislation to that effect later this year.
   The Cosmetics, Toiletry and Fragrance Association defended the
industry, saying: ``There isn't a serious safety problem ... If
there was ... the agency would know about it and the public would
know about it.''
   The association, the main trade organization for the cosmetics
industry, has been encouraging manufacturers to register
voluntarily with the FDA and has been collecting and reviewing
safety data on chemicals used in cosmetics, said Michael Petrina,
the group's vice president for legislative relations.
   ``The FDA has plenty of information now to make any judgments to
deal with any safety concerns,'' he said. ``We don't think the FDA
needs any more authority to regulate ... We don't think it makes
any sense to divert their scarce resources to an industry that has
a demonstrated safety record.''
   The GAO report said that according to FDA estimates, there are
about 2,000 to 2,500 cosmetics manufacturers and about twice as
many distributors.
   The drug agency's records show that 778, or 31 percent to 39
percent, had registered with the agency as of July 1989, compared
with about 40 percent in 1977, the report said.
   The trade association says the total number of manufacturers is
no more than 2,000 and the number registered is closer to 60
percent. And the group notes that the 778 registered last year was
94 more than in July 1988.
   About 3 percent of the estimated 4,000 to 5,000 distributors
have reported adverse effects of personal-care products to the FDA,
the report said.
   The FDA can inspect manufacturers, collect samples and go to
court to force products off the market if it finds safety problems.
   But the report noted that only companies that register with the
FDA will be inspected, because otherwise the agency doesn't know
they exist. Also, unless a company reports safety-testing data to
the agency, their products won't be reviewed by the FDA.
   ``Because it is a voluntary program ... FDA will never be able
to require reporting from all companies, particularly those that
may be least likely to report because they have experienced
problems with their cosmetics,'' the report said.
   The report also said FDA officials have said their investigators
have found many manufacturers lack adequate data on safety tests of
their products and, unless there is a problem, refuse to disclose
the results of their safety tests.
   An FDA spokesman said agency officials had not yet seen the
report and had no immediate comment.
   Cosmetic products sold to consumers must list ingredients on the
label, but that regulation does not apply to products sold for use
in business establishments like beauty salons, the report said.
   Wyden said he is particularly concerned that the FDA had not
done its own assessments of the4 health effects of 884 chemicals
available for use in cosmetics that are listed in the government's
Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances.
   Petrina said his association has reviewed the chemicals and
found that many are not used in personal-care products. Of those
that are, none poses a safety problem in the small quantities in
which it used, he said.

   Thousands of Georgians chanting
``Occupiers! Occupiers!'' rallied outside a Soviet military base
Monday, capping a day of protests recalling a bloody clash that
sparked their republic's independence movement.
   The day of commemorations drew almost 200,000 people to three
separate rallies. It served as a show of strength by independence
activists who have scored several major victories in the past month.
   Soldiers assaulted a peaceful pro-independence protest in front
of government buildings in Tbilisi on April 9, 1989, with shovels
and gas. Nineteen people died.
   The attack unleashed bitter criticism across the country.
Several investigations have placed the blame for ordering the
attack as high as the Communist Party Politburo. But no one has
been blamed officially.
   Protesters near the Caucasus Military District headquarters
posted signs reading, ``Get out of Georgia!'' and depicting a
hooded executioner wearing a military star and holding a bloody
shovel.
   Early Monday morning, about 100,000 people gathered in
candlelight on Rustavelli Boulevard, the site of the clash. About
70,000 more nearly filled the republic's main stadium Monday
evening in a similar rally.
   At an intersection outside the walled military base, about
10,000 people gathered in the afternoon and shouted through
megaphones for the soldiers to abandon their posts.
   Eldar Shengelaya, a well-known Georgian director, addressed the
soldiers as ``esteemed occupiers,'' and told them the army could
turn them into ``beasts.''
   ``Think!'' he said. ``This is your last chance to turn into
people!''
   There was no visible reaction from the few soldiers seen on the
base. Authorities did not interfere with the protest, and Georgian
policeman helped keep order.
   Protests in other Soviet republics have included anti-military
elements, among them calls to boycott the draft, but Monday's
demonstration was one of the largest directed specifically against
the Soviet military.
   Top Soviet generals have complained in recent months about a
growing ``campaign to discredit'' the army, particularly in
republics with rising independence movements.
   In the Baltic republics, this spring's military call-up is
expected to bring large numbers of draft dodgers, and Georgians
said they expect the same.
   Georgia is not the only republic with a strong independence
movement. The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia;
Moldavia; and the neighboring Caucasus republics of Azerbaijan and
Armenia also have strong independence movements.
   Lithuania's is the strongest _ it declared itself independent
from the Soviet Union on March 11, and the standoff with the
Kremlin continues. In Moscow on Monday, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his top advisory body said new economic and political
steps would be taken to break Lithuanian intransigence. No details
were given.
   The leader of Latvia's Supreme Soviet said Monday he is certain
Latvian legislators also will vote to secede from the Soviet Union
when they meet next month, but that the independence process will
be gradual.
   Zviad Gamsakhurdia, an independence activist long considered the
dean of Georgian dissident, told reporters Sunday the April 9
anniversary was a ``day of great sorrow, but also a day of
victory'' for Georgians.
   ``On this day, the Georgian soul was revived,'' he said. ``April
9 was the beginning of the national, democratic revolution of
Georgia, which is continuing.''
   He said only a small percentage of Georgians favored
independence before the clash last April 9 but that now the vast
majority favor independence from Moscow.
   On March 9, the Georgian Supreme Soviet, or parliament,
condemned what it said was the republic's forced annexation to the
Soviet Union and demanded negotiations on restoring independence.
Later the same month, lawmakers put off local elections to give
opponents to the Communists a chance to organize.
   At Monday's protest, speakers urged parents to help their
children evade the draft. The protest ended with a mass recitation
of the Lord's Prayer.
   At the stadium rally later, electric scoreboards read, ``In
eternal memory of the innocents killed April 9.''
   Among the guests on the field were five 8-year-old girls in
white voile, who recited poems and a prayer in honor of two
schoolmates who died in the clash.
   Most of the rally focused on hard-core politics.
   Gamsakhurdia read a list of 23 demands to the Soviet government.
They included cancellation of military service for Georgians,
declaration that the April 9 clash was ``genocide against the
Georgian people,'' and punishment of those responsible.
   The thousands in the stands raised their hands to show their
approval.
   Irakly Tsereteli, head of the radical National Independence
Party, called for Gandhi-style civil disobedience to further the
push for independence.
   The Soviet TV news program ``Vremya'' gave prominent and
sympathetic play to the memorial service.
   Gorbachev offered his condolences to Georgia on Sunday, but
independence activists dismissed them as empty words.

<HEAD>Authorities Must Overcome Resistance to Economic Reforms, Official
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top economic adviser to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev said Monday that authorities will have to overcome strong
public resistance to push through a radical market-oriented
economic reform program this year.
   ``A speedy transition to a market economy will come up against
powerful opposition,'' Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin told a
news conference. ``We must do it, whether we like it or not.
   ``What we must do first is to make all people understand and see
clearly that without such a transition, the country has no future
as a highly developed great power.''
   As he answered reporters' questions, Abalkin repeatedly dodged
specifics, implying that key decisions in the reform program had
not yet been made. For example, he said the state must lift
controls on prices, but would not specify which prices would be
freed or when.
   He also denied reports circulating among the foreign business
community that some form of convertible ruble would be introduced
by this summer. He said experts believe the Soviet market must have
something to sell first and it will take years before the country's
currency will be convertible.
   Several officials have suggested in recent weeks that the Soviet
Union was considering a plan to provide a Polish-style ``shock
therapy'' for the Soviet economy, which would boost prices,
drastically cut the value of the ruble and raise unemployment.
   In December, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov outlined to the Soviet
Congress an economic program calling for five more years of central
planning, with a gradual introduction of some elements of a market
economy. It further delayed a reform of prices, which are currently
set by bureaucrats without regard to the cost of production.
   But in March, just after he was given a new, powerful post as
president, Gorbachev said more radical economic reforms were
urgently needed.
   The reforms are being speeded up due to ``destabilization of the
political system, development of ethnic and regional conflicts, and
deficits in the consumer goods market,'' Abalkin said.
   With the economy stalled partway between central planning and a
market system, industrial production fell 1.2 percent in the first
quarter of 1990 compared with the last quarter of 1989.
   ``Unless we go over to the new methods, we will deprive
ourselves and our children of a highly developed and efficient
economy and a powerful country, where people will want to live and
which the people will not be ashamed of,'' Abalkin said.
   ``We will have to make sacrifices,'' he added. ``But there must
be a social consensus for that.''
   State Price Committee chief Vyacheslav Senchagov told the
legislature last week that among the three reform variants under
consideration was the Polish example of a crash program to create a
maret economy.
   Poland hopes the abrupt transformation will keep the painful
period short, and the inflation rate has already fallen drastically
from the triple-digit level of January.
   But Abalkin said the Soviet government cannot count on public
support for such a policy.
   He left unsaid the fact that Poland's shock program was
instituted by the new Solidarity-led government, which replaced the
unpopular Communists last August.

   Lothar de Maiziere, the prime
minister-designate, proposed a Cabinet on Monday that includes the
major political parties and has a peace activist as defense
minister.
   The Christian Democrat leader unveiled the tentative composition
of East Germany's first democratic government after negotiations
with the nation's diverse political groups.
   Parliament is expected to vote on nominations to the 24-member
Cabinet on Thursday.
   Agreement was reached in five days of talks with the Social
Democrats, who finished second to the Christian Democrats in East
Germany's first free elections March 18.
   Differences between the two main parties still exist on the pace
and form of eventual unification with West Germany, including how
much of the socialist welfare state should be retained for East
Germans who depend on food and housing subsidies.
   German reunification was the main issue in the elections and
remains the overriding priority, but agreement on a Cabinet clears
a major hurdle. De Maiziere's government would replace Communist
caretaker administrations that have run the country since the
pro-democracy revolt in October.
   A three-party conservative alliance led by de Maiziere would
dominate the new Cabinet with 14 seats. The Social Democrats would
have seven posts and three would go to a smaller liberal alliance.
   Eleven of the 24 seats actually were filled, with talks to
continue Tuesday on naming the rest of the ministers.
   Social Democrat leader Markus Meckel was nominated to be foreign
minister.
   The Social Democrats also will hold the post of finance minister
and named Walter Romberg, a key negotiator with Bonn over the
planned monetary union.
   Rainer Eppelmann, who leads the Democratic Awakening party, part
of de Maiziere's alliance, was chosen defense minister. His
ministry's name was changed to Department of Defense and
Disarmament, a symbolic reference to German demands for fewer
nuclear weapons in superpower military stategy.
   Eppelmann, a Lutheran minister and peace activist who took part
in the revolt against Stalinist leader Erich Honecker, probably
will play a role in talks on a united Germany's future role in the
Eastern and Western military alliances.
   Leaders of the Social Democrats expressed satisfaction with
Monday's talks, but party spokesman Guenther Krug said
``substantial differences'' that remain would be the subject of
further negotiations.
   ``We assume that difficult negotiations lie ahead,'' Krug said.
   Although de Maiziere's alliance won the most seats in the
400-member Parliament, it lacks the two-thirds majority needed to
enact constitutional changes that would allow quick unification
with West Germany.
   A coalition with the Social Democrats would give de Maiziere
control. If negotiations with that party fail, he can try for
agreements with other parties.
   De Maiziere supports rapid reunification of Germany, as does
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, but the Social Democrats
favor a more gradual process.
   They also differ on the role of an East German government, which
faces severe economic problems but also is likely to be a
short-lived transitional administration.
   Among issues still to be clarified are West Germany's role in
NATO, East Germany's membership in the Warsaw Pact, and the
difficult question of private property.
   East Germans have not been allowed to own land, and West Germans
have made claims on property their ancestors owned before the
nation was divided after World War II.
   Social Democratic leaders want employees to share in former
state-owned companies, but the Christian Democrats favor complete
sale to private owners.
   The Parliament, elected March 18, convened April 4 and
designated de Maiziere as prime minister. It also began dismantling
the 40-year-old Communist system and created an office of president.
   Sabine Bergmann-Pohl, president of Parliament, was named acting
national president and assumed her duties as head of state Monday.
She urged a quick conclusion of the coalition talks, installation
of a new government and choice of a permanent president.
   Hanging like a cloud over the process of building a new
political order are allegations that some members of the new
Parliament had ties to the reviled secret police of the old
Communist regime.
   De Maiziere has denied such allegations in his own case. Two
other accused political leaders have resigned.
   Parliament is expected to vote on whether to form an independent
commission to investigate the allegations. The former secret police
agency has been disbanded.

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, issued a
Passover message Monday saluting the ``march of freedom'' for
Soviet Jews allowed to emigrate to Israel in the past year.
   ``A great march of freedom is underway for Soviet Jewry, and
this year many thousands will celebrate the Seder with their
families in Israel,'' Bush said.
   ``For these people, and for their brethren waiting to emigrate,
`next year in Jerusalem,' is becoming a promise fulfilled,'' the
message said.
   At the Seder, the traditional Passover meal, Jews worldwide
pledge to celebrate the feast ``next year in Jerusalem.''
   ``The call for liberty and freedom,'' Bush said, ``is now being
heard around the world _ in Eastern Europe, in Central and South
America, in Africa and even in the Soviet Union.''
   About 29,000 Soviet Jews moved to Israel during 1989 and the
first three months of this year, and the pace apparently is
increasing.

<TEXT>
   A Philadelphia auto parts manufacturer will
pay a $1.5 million fine for violations of government noise
standards on the job, the Labor Department said Monday.
   The settlement between the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration and the Budd Co. also calls for the firm to improve
record-keeping and to protect employees from excessive noise.
   Last December, OSHA proposed $3.3 million in fines against the
company for more than 840 alleged violations at its Philadelphia
plant, including failure to tell some workers that tests showed
their hearing was deteriorating.
   Government regulatory agencies frequently reduce proposed fines
after negotiating with alleged violators.
   Budd, which makes doors, lift gates and other body stampings for
motor vehicles, has about 2,400 people working at the Philadelphia
plant. The Troy, Mich.-based company is a subsidiary of the West
Germany's Thyssen Industries and has plants in Indiana, Kentucky,
Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
   Under the settlement, the company will monitor noise and test
employees to identify all workers exposed above a certain noise
level. The workers will be notified of the results and trained to
use hearing protectors, the Labor Department said.
   In addition, the company has agreed to reduce noise at its
Philadelphia plant through engineering controls and repair and
maintenance of equipment. The company also will train employees to
keep records in line with agency requirements.

<HEAD>5 Felony Charges, 3 Misdemeanors Filed Against Hunter Thompson</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunter Thompson, the dean of gonzo
journalism, was charged Monday with possessing blasting caps and
various drugs police found after a former porn actress accused the
writer of molesting her in his home.
   Thompson, 52, appeared in Pitkin County District Court with
three lawyers and pleaded innocent to three misdemeanors:
third-degree sexual assault, third-degree simple assault and
possession of marijuana.
   Those charges were based on allegations by Gail Palmer-Slater,
35, star of ``The Erotic Adventures of Candy,'' that Thompson threw
a drink at her, twisted her breast and shoved her during a visit at
his home Feb. 21.
   Her allegations led to a police search of Thompson's home Feb.
26 and 27. Police said they seized blasting caps and substances
they allege to be LSD, cocaine, the tranquilizer Diazepam and
marijuana.
   An April 23 hearing was set on five felony charges: three counts
of possession of a controlled substance, one charge of using
cocaine and one charge of unlawful possession of incendiary devices.
   On leaving the courthouse, Thompson was asked why he thinks
authorities have brought charges against him, when for years he has
freely admitted to using drugs.
   ``I stand for everything they don't like,'' he said. ``It's a
witch hunt.''
   Palmer-Slater, who lives in Port Huron, Mich., said she went to
Thompson's home in Woody Creek to discuss a business enterprise,
and claimed he became angry when she refused to conduct the
discussion in his hot tub.
   Thompson says he never assaulted the woman. He told reporters
Palmer-Slater was drunk and was pressuring him to have sex with her
when he pushed her away.
   Thompson remains free on $2,000 bond. Deputy District Attorney
Charles McCrory said Thompson could receive a maximum of 16 years
in prison if convicted of all eight charges against him.
   Thompson is the author of several books written in a style that
has come to be known as ``gonzo journalism,'' intermingling a
description of real events with exaggerated accounts of his own
involvement, which often including drug and alcohol abuse.
   Thompson ran a full-page advertisement Monday in the Aspen Times
Daily that read: ``BEWARE. Today: the Doctor. Tomorrow: You.'' The
ad was paid for by the ``Hunter S. Thompson Legal Defense Fund.''
   Thompson's books include ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,''
``Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail,'' ``The Great Shark
Hunt'' and ``Generation of Swine,'' a compilation of some of his
newspaper and magazine columns.

   The former head of the
Slovakia commerce commission doused his body with gasoline and
burned himself to death Monday, Czechoslovakia television reported.
   ``We found a container with gasoline and a set of matches on the
spot where it happened,'' a police official insisting on anonymity
told The Associated Press by phone.
   The 58-year-old executive, who was not named, once headed the
state inspection body in Bratislava. The Commercial Commission is a
watchdog body in Slovakia overseeing business transactions.
   At least five suicides by former officials have been reported in
Czechoslovakia since the peaceful revolution last winter ended the
Communists' long monopoly on power.
   Police said they had no immediate motive for Monday morning's
suicide.
   ``The man died on the spot, the cause being heavy burns. The
motivation of his act is still subject to investigation,'' he said.
``He did not leave a note or anything.''
   According to the official, the man walked into a courtyard of
the Drutechna company office building in downtown Bratislava and
set himself on fire at 8 a.m.

   A deputy premier said Monday that it now is the
government _ and not Communist Party leaders _ who are making the
key policy decisions in the Soviet Union.
   The comment by Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin at a news
conference on economic reform was an indication the 12-man
Communist Party Politburo might be following through on Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's plan for the party to hand over some of its power to
the government and permit a multiparty system.
   Gorbachev became the country's first executive president on
March 15, and has formed new government advisory groups including a
presidential council.
   Answering a question on proposed economic reforms, Abalkin said
the Politburo ``will not be making any decisions from now on, and
it is already not making the decisions. Decisions can be made by
the president, the parliament and the Congress of People's
Deputies. Those are the decision-making entities now.''
   Abalkin, however, is neither a full nor non-voting member of the
Politburo. He did not elaborate.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his
Presidential Council said Monday that new economic and political
steps will be taken to break Lithuania's unyielding stand on
independence.
   The advisory body's tough statement indicated the conflict is
far from resolved despite a high-level meeting last week and
conciliatory words by both sides.
   Lithuania told Gorbachev on Thursday it was ready to negotiate
with Moscow but did not intend to bow to his order that it back
away from its March 11 declaration of independence before any talks
could begin.
   The Soviet Union forcibly annexed Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia
in 1940.
   ``Members of the Presidential Council concluded that additional
economic, political and other measures should be taken to protect
the Soviet Constitution and the interests of citizens living in the
republic and the Soviet Union as a whole,'' the Tass news agency
reported Monday.
   It did not say what kinds of steps the council had in mind.
   Gorbachev has ordered Lithuanians to turn in their firearms and
told the republic not to form unarmed patrols. The Soviet military
has arrested some Lithuanian deserters who left after their
homeland declared its independence, and has occupied several public
buildings in Lithuania's capital Vilnius.
   But after a meeting last week between Lithuanian representatives
and a major Gorbachev adviser, Politburo member Alexander N.
Yakovlev, both sides were making conciliatory statements.
   On Sunday, however, a crowd of Lithuanians prevented hundreds of
Soviet soldiers from entering a plant that prints pro-independence
newspapers. Pro-Moscow Communists had ordered the plant to shut
down.
   Quoting the Presidential Council, Tass said Monday: ``The reply
by the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet was not constructive and did not
open an avenue toward settling problems. In fact, it leads matters
to a dead end. ...
   ``The present Lithuanian leadership is blocking any exit from
the crisis with its anti-constitutional actions and the escalation
of illegal measures. It is aggravating the situation in the
republic, for which it bears full responsibility.''
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, speaking before the
latest salvo from the Kremlin, was quoted by Tass as complaining
that ``Moscow does not want talks or even preliminary good will
contacts'' with Lithuania.
   The republic also told its young men who will be called up in
the Soviet draft this spring that it is up to them whether they
want to serve.
   Refusal to serve in the Soviet armed forces will not be
considered a criminal offense, according to official Lithuanian
radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   In Moscow, national deputies opposing Lithuania's independence
drive asked Gorbachev to dissolve the Lithuanian legislature and
reiterated its demand for direct presidential rule.
   On Monday, Estonian leaders decided to send a draft response to
Gorbachev's criticism of their bid for independence to legislative
committees for debate, a local journalist reported, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Estonia has declared Soviet rule occupation of an independent
country, and voted to re-establish independence at the end of a
still-undefined transition period. Gorbachev has demanded Estonia
back down.
   Latvia's new Communist Party chief, Alfreds Rubiks, asked a
minority group of members who walked out of the party congress over
the weekend not to follow Lithuanians and Estonians by establishing
an independent party.
   Most delegates voted to keep party ties with Moscow. The
minority wants an independent Communist Party and moved to
establish it this month.
   Anatolijs Gorbunovs, president of Latvia's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, said Monday he is certain Latvian legislators will vote
to secede from the Soviet Union when they meet next month but full
separation is to be achieved in ``negotiations and discussions.''
   He spoke at a news conference in Geneva, where he attended a
symposium.

<HEAD>Former Police Office Guilty In Murder Of Neighbor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former policeman, who contended that
insanity, drugs, alcohol and the movie ``Apocalypse Now'' drove him
to the shotgun killing of an envied neighbor, was convicted Monday
of first-degree murder.
   Robert McLaughlin, 49, of Hampton stood expressionless as the
verdict was read. The Rockingham County Superior Court, which
deliberated more than three days, also found him guilty of
conspiracy to commit murder.
   McLaughlin faces an automatic prison sentence of life without
parole. No date for sentencing was set. McLaughlin's attorney,
Michael Iacopino, said the conviction would be appealed to the
state Supreme Court.
   ``He deserves to spend his life in prison for all the hurt he's
caused,'' said McLaughlin's son, Robert Jr., who was a witness for
the prosecution.
   The twisted case began when former teacher Robert Cushing, 63, a
successful real estate agent, was killed by two shotgun blasts when
he answered the door of his home the night of June 1, 1988, while
his wife sat in another room.
   The shooting shocked the seaside community of 12,000. Police
were baffled until McLaughlin, an 18-year Hampton police officer
who was not a suspect, surrendered that August. He admitted the
shooting, then recanted.
   McLaughlin's wife, Susan, 38, was charged with being an
accomplice to murder. She was convicted and sentenced to life
without parole.
   At his pretrial hearings, McLaughlin testified that his wife had
killed Cushing, and his lawyers produced letters she wrote
McLaughlin from prison in which she admitted killing Cushing.
   Then, without explanation, McLaughlin's lawyers quit the case,
and it was delayed more than six months while new lawyers were
found and prepared his defense. Meanwhile, McLaughlin's wife
obtained a divorce.
   When the trial began, his awyers acknowledged McLaughlin pulled
the trigger, but pleaded insanity, saying he was under the
influence of alcohol, the tranquilizer Xanax and had just watched
the violent Vietnam movie ``Apocalypse Now'' on the night of the
shooting.
   After several trial delays, a three-week trial and more than
three days of deliberations, Assistant Attorney General Michael
Ramsdell said, ``Finally ... justice has been done.''
   The victim's son, Robert Cushing Jr., said ``there is no joy in
any of this.'' He and other members of the family wept as the
verdict was read.
   ``The one thing I hope now is we can go on and have a healing,
not just for our family, but for Bobby McLaughlin ... their
families and the community,'' he said.
   In closing arguments, prosecutor Barbara Keshen contrasted a
``desperately unhappy'' McLaughlin with a contented, successful
Cushing.
   The two had been feuding for 13 years, since McLaughlin
investigated a traffic accident outside Cushing's home in which
Cushing, an onlooker, was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge.
McLaughlin was cleared of brutality charges.

   A man surrendered Monday and was charged
with murder in the killing of a customer who was ahead of him in
line at a drive-in fast food restaurant.
   Gary Bernard Scott, 23, of Augusta was being held without bond,
sheriff's deputies said.
   He is accused of killing Dale Brantley Peeler, 30, who got out
of his car to argue with two people who blew their horn after he
paused to check his order in the drive-through lane at a Krystal
restaurant south of Augusta early Thursday.
   A 16-year-old juvenile who was with Scott was arrested Saturday
and was charged with being an accessory to murder, a felony,
authorities said.
   Police obtained a warrant against Scott after interviewing the
juvenile.

<TEXT>
   Searchers poking through the rubble of
a residential hotel razed by a fast-moving fire found three more
bodies Monday, raising the death toll to nine, authorities said.
   As many as 60 searchers from several agencies used trained dogs
and construction equipment to search the three-story Fontana Hotel.
Six residents of the 39-year-old hotel still are listed as missing.
   One body found Monday was on the top floor in the rear, away
from the most severe fire damage. Another victim was found in the
lobby area, where the roof caved in during the pre-dawn fire
Friday, police Detective Tom Hoolahan said. The third body was
found in an elevator.
   The search for bodies is slowed by the meticulous examination of
fragments from the 102-room hotel, located between Miami Beach's
trendy art deco district and a strip of luxury high-rise
condominiums.
   Crews are studying each charred board and sifting ashes and
burned debris looking for any clues to the fire's origin and the
victims' identities. The searchers included arson investigators
from the city and state fire marshal's office and the U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco.
   Detective Jim Hyde said it may be two weeks before a final
determination is made on the cause of the fire, the worst in the
seaside city in nearly 20 years.
   Many of the nearly 100 residents who escaped the fire have taken
temporary shelter at nearby hotels or with family members.
   The Fontana complied with current fire regulations, according to
city officials, and was equipped with smoke detectors in each room.
But the hotel did not have sprinklers, which are required by law
beginning in 1991.

<HEAD>Disturbances Reported Near China's Soviet Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Riots flared last weekend in Moslem areas near
China's border with the Soviet Union, a Western diplomat said
Monday.
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the diplomat said an
official from the Zinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region confimed reports
of civil unrest in the area.
   The disturbances erupted over the past few days near Kashgar, a
bazaar city near China's arid border with the Soviet republics of
Tadzhikistan and Kirghizia, said the diplomat, who had no further
information.
   The Foreign Affairs Office in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang, would
neither confirm nor deny the reports. It said merely it was ``not
clear'' when asked if troops were dispatched to quell rioting.
   In Xinjiang's government office in Beijing, an official said he
did not know if reports that Kashgar was closed to foreigners were
true.
   More than half Xinjiang's population of 14 million are from the
Uygur, Hui and other Moslem groups with close ethnic ties to Soviet
Moslems. Moslem riots occurred in Urumqi last May and relations
between local minorities and the Beijing government have long been
tense.
   All foreign journalists and diplomats have been barred from
Xinjiang since the outbreak of ethnic unrest in adjacent republics
of the Soviet Union.
   The sparsely populated desert province also borders Tibet,
another province where resentment against Chinese rule has become
violent in recent years.
   The China International Tourist Service claimed foreign tourists
could still go to Kashgar but said they would have to leave from
the Urumqi, the provinical capital, on a 700-mile bus trip.
   Xinjiang officials in recent months have repeatedly warned of
separatists trying to stir up trouble.
   Xinjiang's delegates to the just-concluded annual session of
China's legislature called for increased vigilance against ``a
small number of separatists who present the greatest threat to
Xinjiang's stability.''
   The region's Communist Party chief, Song Hanliang, said after a
tour of Kashgar and other areas of southern Xinjiang in February
that ``every place and work unit now has some `hot spot' problems.''
   He called for strengthened control over religious activities,
saying the government must not allow religion to be used to promote
separatist tendencies.

<HEAD>IRA Land Mine Blast Kills Four Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOWNPATRICK, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful land mine
exploded under a Land Rover on Monday morning, killing four
soldiers and throwing the military vehicle 30 feet in the air. Two
motorists also were injured.
   The Irish Republican Army's South Down Brigade claimed
responsibility for the attack, which Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher linked to recent decisions by the Irish Supreme Court not
to extradite prisoners wanted in Northern Ireland on terrorism
charges.
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey discounted Thatcher's
statements.
   ``I don't think anybody could seriously believe that the people
who carry out these atrocities could have any regard for the
decisions of any court,'' Haughey said. ``They follow their own
futile agenda.''
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, the British government
minister responsible for the province, said ``actions of this sort
are wholly senseless in that they will not deflect us from our
intention to defend the community against these evil men.''
   The explosion occurred just before 8 a.m. near the Downpatrick
race course in County Down, in the southeast part of the province.
The area was quickly sealed off and police and soldiers were
airlifted in to search for clues.
   Police said the blast created a crater 15 feet deep and 40 feet
wide and hurled the vehicle into a nearby field ``crushed like a
sardine tin.''
   Several other soldiers traveling in front in another Land Rover
suffered shock, said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
   The soldiers were members of the Ulster Defense Regiment, the
mainly Protestant, locally recruited regiment of the British Army,
said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom.
   A pair of overalls was found a half-mile from the site of the
explosion. Security chiefs then warned all police and army units
that an attack might be imminent.
   On Friday, the Irish Supreme Court ruled not to extradite Owen
Carron, a former Northern Ireland member of Parliament, saying he
was a political prisoner.
   ``You take these murders of these four people today alongside
those decisions in the Supreme Court of the Republic not to
extradite those accused of violent crime and one is very, very
depressed,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``Violent crime is not political, it's common criminal,'' she
said.
   The court had issued a similar ruling earlier three weeks
earlier in which it refused to extradite escaped prisoners, saying
they would be subject to assault by prison guards if they were
returned.
   The Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British rule in
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.

   Fire broke out in the engine room of a French
ferry 14 miles off Britain's Isle of Wight on Monday, and one of
the 675 people aboard died after a heart attack. A crewman was
overcome by smoke, but the blaze was extinguished by the crew, the
coast guard said.
   It was the third fatal ferry fire in the region since Saturday,
when a blaze destroyed the Norwegian North Sea ferry Scandivavian
Star, leaving an estimated death toll of 170. In Britain, police
began an arson investigation of a fire early Monday on the Irish
Sea car ferry Norrona that killed one man.
   The fatality in Monday's fire on the Reine Mathilde off
England's south coast was a 66-year-old passenger who was not
immediately identified. The crew member, suffering from smoke
inhalation, was to be transported by helicopter to a mainland
hospital, a coast guard spokesman said.
   Cause of the blaze was unknown.
   The owner, Brittany Ferries, said the vessel was traveling from
Caen, France, to Portsmouth, England, with 600 passengers, 71 crew
and four service personnel.
   A doctor, traveling as a passenger, assisted the ship's doctor
but was unable to revive the heart attack victim.
   A company spokeswoman said: ``The fire broke out half-an-hour
before the end of the 5}-hour crossing, in a engine room not near
where any of the passengers would normally be.
   ``We know the passenger suffered a heart attack but we do not
yet know at what stage of the journey this happened, or whether it
was during the fire.''
   The vessel was without power, but there appeared to be no danger
to the rest of the ship.
   The naval tug Powerful was being dispatched to tow the ferry
into Portsmouth, where it was expected to arrive about 6 a.m. (1
a.m. EDT) Tuesday.

   Soviet authorities have denied entry

   Foreign Ministry under-Secretary Pierre Schori, a member of the

was ``deeply regrettable.''
   ``Already before, with its decision to deny visas to

   ``Now it apparently is going a step further and stops an
official cultural delegation,'' TT quoted Schori as saying.

   PERU:
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the acclaimed novelist once considered a
sure bet to become Peru's next president, finds himself sidetracked
by the ``Fujimori phenomenon.''
   Agricultural engineer Alberto Fujimori, 51, son of Japanese
immigrants and a political unknown until a month ago, forced Vargas
Llosa into a runoff and is now favored to win the presidency.
   Fujimori received 29 percent of the vote Sunday to 33.9 percent
for Vargas Llosa, unofficial returns say. Vargas Llosa needed a
majority to avoid a runoff, which now probably will take place in
early June.
   Luis Alva Castro, candidate of the governing left-of-center
Aprista Party, received 16.4 percent. Two Marxist candidates split
11 percent of the vote and the rest was divided among four minor
candidates and blank and void ballots.
   Public opinion analysts say Fujimori's strong second-place
finish Sunday reflected Peruvians' alienation from traditional
political parties and their desire for ``miraculous, painless''
solutions to Peru's ills.
   Inflation runs at more than 2,000 percent annually. More than
18,000 people have died in the struggle between radical Shining
Path guerrillas and security forces.

   GREECE:
   Constantine Mitsotakis, leader of New Democracy, cut a deal with
the small Democratic Renewal party to form a government after
Sunday election returns showed his conservative party one seat
short of a parliamentary majority.
   Official results showed New Democracy won 150 of the 300 seats
in the single-house Parliament in the third parliamentary elections
in 10 months. The conservatives also fell short in June and
November elections.
   Mitsotakis met Monday with Costis Stephanopoulos and they agreed
Democratic Renewal's one victorious candidate would support New
Democracy to give it 151 seats. The government will be all-New
Democracy, however.
   The political impasse since last June has left untended the
problems of a crumbling economy and growing urban terrorism.
   With almost all of the 16,584 polling stations reporting,
official returns gave New Democracy 46.89 percent of the vote; the
Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, 38.62 percent, and 123
seats; the Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, 10.28
percent and 19 seats, and the eight remaining seats split among
four independents, two Greek-Moslems, one environmentalist and
Democratic Renewal.

   HUNGARY:
   Leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the conservative
party that won elections ending 43 years of Communist rule in
Hungary, began work Monday to form a center-right governing
coalition.
   Democratic Forum won nearly 43 percent of the vote and 165 of
the 386 house seats contested Sunday and in a first round of
elections two weeks ago, unofficial results showed.
   Jozsef Antall, president of Democratic Forum, told reporters
Monday, ``We have the possibility of forming a solid government
with our possible coalition partners'' _ the agrarian Independent
Smallholders, third with 11 percent of the vote, and the Christian
Democrats, tied for fifth with more than 5 percent.
   Unofficial results gave the Smallholders 43 seats and the
Christian Democrats 21.
   Such a coalition would force the liberal League of Free
Democrats and its ideological ally, the League of Young Democrats,
into the opposition. The former Communists, now grouped into the
governing Socialist Party, probably would join them.
   The Free Democrats won about 24 percent of Parliament, with 92
seats. The Young Democrats were tied with the Christian Democrats
for 21 seats, and the Socialist Party was fourth with more than 8
percent, for 33 seats.
   Antall's new government is expected to introduce market forces
into the economy.

   YUGOSLAVIA:
   Communist reformer Milan Kucan got the most votes for president
of Slovenia in Yugoslavia's first free election since 1945, but
must face conservative rival Joze Pucnik in a runoff, election
results showed Monday.
   The runoff will be held April 22 because neither won a majority.
   With 98 percent of the vote counted from Sunday's elections,
Kucan led with 44.4 percent. Pucnik of DEMOS, a coalition of five
conservative groups, was second with 26.2 percent; independent Ivan
Kramberger third with 18.9 percent, and Marko Demsar of the Liberal
Party fourth with 10.5 percent.
   An estimated 1.1 million Slovenians, 75 percent of those
eligible, voted in communist Yugoslavia's first multiparty election
since World War II. They also chose a legislature from candidates
representing 17 political parties.
   Political analysts predict a close contest in the runoff. Pucnik
wants Slovenia to secede from Yugoslavia. Kucan advocates a more
cautious approach.
   Initial results suggest the Slovenian Communist Party _ its name
newly changed to the Party of Democratic Renewal _ will become the
largest single party in the republic's legislature but DEMOS will
have the most seats.
   Support for secession has grown in Slovenia, the most liberal
and prosperous of Yugoslavia's six republics, because of the slow
pace of political and economic reform elsewhere in the federation.

   After a night of celebration, leaders
of the conservative party that won elections ending 43 years of
Communist rule began working Monday to form a center-right
governing coalition.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum won nearly 43 percent of the
vote, securing 165 of the 386 house seats contested in Sunday's
balloting and in a first round of elections two weeks ago,
according to unofficial results.
   ``No one should be blinded by the euphoria of victory,'' the
party's president, Jozsef Antall, told a news conference Monday.
   Referring to the agrarian Independent Smallholders and the
Christian Democrats, Antall said: ``We have the possibility of
forming a solid government with our possible coalition partners.''
   Both parties are ideologically close to the Democratic Forum in
their emphasis on Christian values and a generally conservative
outlook.
   The Smallholders were third with 11 percent of the vote and the
Christian Democrats tied for fifth with more than 5 percent.
   According to the unofficial results, the Smallholders got 43
seats and the Christian Democrats 21. Official results were not
expected before Tuesday.
   Leaders of the Smallholders and the Christian Democrats told
separate news conferences they were interested in a coalition with
the Democratic Forum.
   Such a union would force the second-strongest party, the liberal
League of Free Democrats, and its ideological ally, the League of
Young Democrats, into the opposition. They would likely be joined
by the former Communists, now grouped into the Socialist Party.
   The Free Democrats won about 24 percent of Parliament, with 92
seats. The Young Democrats were tied with the Christian Democrats
for 21 seats, and the ruling Socialist Party was fourth with more
than 8 percent, for 33 seats.
   Antall said it would take at least a month to form a new
government, which is expected to introduce market forces into the
economy, crippled after decades of centralized control under the
Communists. It also faces a $20 billion foreign debt.
   The Forum favors a more gradual approach to economic reform to
soften the effects of inevitable inflation and unemployment.
   The Free Democrats, formed by former leading dissidents,
campaigned on a platform for quicker change.
   In apparent reference to his party's chief rival, the Free
Democrats, Antall said he ``would like to rely on the other side as
well.''
   Antall ruled out cooperation with the Socialist Party, which was
formed last year by Communist reformers.
   An additional eight seats in the 394 seat house will be
allocated to representatives of the national minorities.
   The conservative victory was the second in the two free
elections held in the East bloc this year. In East Germany, where
Eastern Europe's first free elections were held March 18,
conservatives also gained a clear victory. The Communists were
relegated to a relatively unimportant opposition role.

<HEAD>Book by Former Polish Leader Gierek Brings Long Queues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A history of Poland's tumultuous '70s by
former Communist Party leader Edward Gierek topped local bestseller
lists as Poles stood in block-long lines Monday to buy copies of
his memoir.
   ``The Aborted Decade,'' is a 201-page book that features a
series of interviews of Gierek by journalist Janusz Rolicki
conducted from November to February.
   Despite its relatively high local price of $5.28, lines quickly
formed to buy the book, which was sold from the backs of trucks and
sidewalk tables.
   Much of the interest appeared to stem from a desire for a
behind-the-scenes look at the country's recent political history.
   Despite his being deposed in 1980, the 77-year-old Gierek is
remembered fondly by many Poles for raising the standard of living
by borrowing heavily from abroad. The loans contributed in great
part to Poland's $40 billion debt, which it still is unable to pay.
   The debt and subsequent economic problems led to the birth and
rise of Solidarity, the first independent labor union in the Soviet
bloc. Gierek legalized Solidarity in 1980, but because of the
union's growing demands coupled with pressing economic problems, he
was forced to retire.
   Gierek, first secretary of the party from 1970-80, is Poland's
first communist ruler to return to the public eye after being
ousted. The ruling Communists fell from power last year at the
beginning of the East European reforms and in its wake the
Solidarity-led government was created.
   ``There was no chance to publish this before,'' Gierek admits in
a postscript to the paperback issued by a private publisher, Fakt.
He says the Communist Party leadership during the 1980s rejected
his repeated requests for an objective reassessment of the 1970s.
   ``A nation's forgetting or falsifying its past loses the proper
perspective for coming years,'' he wrote.
   ``The history of People's Poland is not a history of a wild and
festering struggle by society against the authorities. First of all
it is a history of the life of several generations, full of bright
and dark spots.''
   He also said he had been ``imprisoned and laughed at'' and later
``condemned to ignomity and humiliation,'' without the right to
defend himself.
   Gierek was briefly interned after martial law was declared in
Poland in 1981. The imprisonment was an effort by the country's
leaders to portray the crackdown as being aimed at both rebellious
union leaders and corrupt party officials.
   He had come to power as the first secretary of the Polish United
Workers Party in December 1970 succeeding Wladyslaw Gomulka, who
was forced out after security forces opened fire on Polish workers
in the Baltic cities of Gdansk and Gdynia, killing scores.

   Army forces and government-armed
tribesman attacked Kurdish guerrillas near the Iraqi border this
weekend, killing 21 in the largest anti-rebel operation in the area
since 1984, Turkish news agencies reported Monday.
   Fifteen guerrillas also were wounded and top rebel party leaders
may have been among the dead, the reports said quoting the regional
governor's office in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir.
   The guerrillas belong to the Kurdish Labor Party, a Marxist
group fighting to establish an independent Kurdish state in
Turkey's southeastern provinces.
   The independent Hurriyet News Agency said dozens of tribesmen
spotted and battled the guerillas Saturday night, preventing the
rebels from retreating into Iraq until government troops arrived.
   The Kurdish Labor Party has camps in neighboring Syria, Iraq and
Iran and its headquarters in the Syrian capital of Damascus,
according to Turkish security officials.
   So far about 2,500 civilians, guerrillas and security forces in
Turkey have died since 1984 in clashes tied to the Kurdish
independence bid.
   After the latest clashes, authorities reported seizing two
rocket launchers and 26 automatic rifles from the guerrillas,
according to the semi-official Anatolia News Agency.

<TEXT>
   An inmate with alleged ties to Salem's drug
underworld was arraigned Monday on aggravated murder charges in the
slaying of Oregon's top prison official over a year ago,
authorities announced Monday.
   Frank E. Gable was charged in an indictment returned Friday and
released Monday with six counts of aggravated murder and one of
murder. He was being held without bail pending another court
appearance next week.
   Gable, 30, who had been serving a jail term for assaulting his
wife and was due to be released Thursday, in recent months had
become the focus of the inquiry into the January 1989 stabbing
death of corrections chief Michael Francke.
   The slaying resulted in the state's most extensive criminal
investigation and also sparked accusations that Department of
Corrections employees were somehow involved in Francke's death.
However, various investigations failed to substantiate claims of a
conspiracy.
   Francke, 42, who had been recruited from New Mexico to run
Oregon's prisons, was attacked as he was leaving work for the day
and walking to his car parked outside the Corrections Department
office. An autopsy showed he died of a stab wound to the heart.
   One of the counts against Gable alleges that Francke's death was
related to his duties as corrections director. Others said Gable
killed Francke in an attempt to cover up an armed robbery or theft.
   Marion County District Attorney Dale Penn said at a news
conference that those ``alternative theories'' would be presented
at trial and that it would be up to a jury to decide which is the
most credible.
   At least one jail inmate has testified that Gable said he killed
Francke during a bungled car burglary. Some inmates have told
authorities Gable worked as a collector for drug traffickers, but
others have described Gable as a small-time dealer who used drugs
himself.
   Penn said his office would seek the death penalty if Gable were
convicted of aggravated murder.
   Gable, who has denied any involvement in Francke's death, said
Monday he was not surprised by the indictment.
   ``I just ask that they not stop looking,'' Gable said in an
interview. ``There's a killer out there somewhere. Don't let me get
railroaded for this.''
   Gable has said that other inmates have been trying to implicate
him in the slaying because he once worked as an informant for the
Keizer police department.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moscow's opposition to Lithuanian independence
can be compared to Abraham Lincoln's fight to keep the South from
seceding, a Soviet official said Monday.
   Yuri A. Reshetov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
department for international humanitarian cooperation and human
rights, told a news conference he visited Washington's Lincoln
Memorial on Sunday.
   The American Civil War president, ``in his second inaugural
address in 1865, said that he is fighting against the forces which
are seeking to dissolve the Union. Abraham Lincoln saved the
American Union,'' Reshetov said.
   ``We have been together with Lithuania, with Estonia and with
Latvia for many, many years,'' he said. ``I still hope that what
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to
dissolution of our union.''
   Reshetov argued that Lithuania's fate should be decided by a
popular vote, rather than by the March 11 declaration by the
parliament in Vilnius rejecting the 1940 Soviet annexation.
   Stasys Lozoraitis Jr., charge d'affaires of the Lithuanian
legation in Washington, said at a separate news conference that
since the Western Powers have never recognized the Soviet
annexation of Lithuania ``the international law that should be
applied is that the Soviets should withdraw.''
   A majority of Lithuanians are for independence, Lozoraitis said,
but a referendum would be ``a trap'' for neighboring Estonia and
Latvia, where sizable minorities oppose independence.
   All three Baltic republics were part of the Russian empire from
the late 18th century until after World War I. They were
independent between the wars but forcibly annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940 after Moscow took control of the republics under
terms of a secret pact with Nazi Germany.
   The Baltic republics have continued to maintain legations as
their diplomatic representatives in Washington.
   Reshetov said the Soviet Union supports self-determination, but
said self-determination can take various forms and ``the creation
of a new state is the highest form.''
   ``In international law it is well established that the means of
determining the right to self-determination is a referendum or
plebiscite,'' the Foreign Ministry official said.
   Asked about the presence of Soviet troops in Lithuania, Reshetov
said, ``The only thing that is happening in this respect in
Lithuania is that law and order should be upheld in this part of
the Soviet Union.''
   Lozoraitis, however, said, ``We can maintain law and order by
ourselves and don't need the Red Army to maintain law and order.''
   The Soviet official was also asked about the expulsion of
Western correspondents from Lithuania on April 1 and about the
occupation of a newspaper plant in Vilnius by Soviet troops on
March 31.
   Reshetov replied that the journalists were exluded under
international law principles that also permit exclusion of foreign
diplomats. He said he hoped it will be ``just for a limited time.''
   The official also said that in recent months Lithuanian
newspapers that opposed secession received no newsprint from
Lithuanian factories but newspapers in favor of secession
``received plenty of paper.''
   Lozoraitis denied that there was any policy of denying newsprint
to papers that opposed independence. He said some newspapers were
not able to get paper because they lacked the financial means.

   An early morning blaze on board the
Irish Sea car ferry Norrona killed one man and injured 32 people on
Monday, police said, and both police and the ship's owner said
arson was suspected.
   The ferry was carrying 297 people from Milford Haven, 180 miles
west of London, to Rosslare, Ireland, and was eight miles off Wales
when the fire was discovered. The blaze damaged 10 cabins.
   The B and I shipping line, with headquarters in Dublin, Ireland,
issued a statement saying it suspected the Norrona fire was started
deliberately. The company said the blaze began in two of Norrona's
unoccupied sleeping cabins.
   It did not elaborate, but the company's marine superintendent,
Capt. Peter McKenna, told Irish Radio, ``The cabins are not
normally locked, but the area was not allocated to passengers for
this particular sailing. The cabins were close to each other in the
same section.''
   McKenna said the company believes mattresses or lighted paper
started the fire.
   It followed a suspicious fire on the Scandinavia Star ferry
early Saturday that killed an estimated 170 people. That fire broke
out while the Danish-owned ship was traveling from Norway to
Denmark with at least 500 aboard.
   ``I am sure the terrible fire on the Scandinavian Star at the
weekend was going through a lot of people's minds. Suddenly, we all
seemed to be in a similar situation,'' said Fred Jenkinson, a
Norrona passenger.
   Survivors described crawling through thick smoke that choked
corridors and cabins.
   ``I took the skin off my knees and toes but, thank God, we got
out alive,'' said Jenkinson, who was asleep in his cabin when he
heard shouts and smelled smoke.
   Assistant Chief Constable Eifion Pritchard, who announced the
criminal inquiry in the Norrona fire, said: ``We do not know the
cause at present but there are grounds for suspecting it may not
have started accidentally.''
   Pritchard said experts were aboard the vessel and a post-mortem
examination was being carried out on the victim.
   B and I said the victim was not a member of the crew.
   Thirty-two passengers needed hospital treatment, mostly for
smoke inhalation, police said.
   Company Chief Executive Jim Kennedy said: ``We are obviously
very concerned ... and are holding our own investigation into the
way everything was handled.''
   Firefighters and crew controlled the blaze within two hours of
the captain's distress call, said coast guard spokesman George
Clarke.
   Three British military helicopters were used to remove injured
people and to take firefighters and two doctors to the vessel.
   The ferry returned to the dock under its own power.
   Fire also broke out Monday in the engine room of the French
ferry Reine Mathilde, which was carrying 675 people fron Caen,
France, to Portsmouth, England, and was extinguished by the crew,
the coast guard said. A 66-year-old passenger died of a heart
attack, and one crew member was overcome by smoke.
   The fire was the third aboard a passenger ship in northern
European waters since Saturday.
   Tugs were dispatched to pull in the Reine Mathilde, which was 14
miles off the Isle of Wight.

   Dan Quayle is not the ``Hoosier stumblebum''
that comedians joke about, says the vice president's fan club,
which has launched a letter-writing campaign to enlighten
late-night entertainers.
   Members of the Hit the Trail for Quayle Club said Monday they
want Johnny Carson and other prominent comedians to knock off
knocking Quayle and find some other target for their monologues.
   ``They make him out to be some Hoosier stumblebum, but he's no
dummy,'' said Noel Clark of Peoria. ``He's really a sharp guy. But
these comedians _ Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Pat Sajak _ and the
liberal-minded press keep jumping on him.
   ``We've written these comedians and told them to lay off Dan
Quayle and clean up their acts.''
   Clark is one of about 30 members of the club, founded earlier
this year by Dorothy Vallosio of Peoria.
   ``We just resent all the jokes bashing our vice president,''
Mrs. Vallosio said. ``They are so mean. And they've criticized him
over and over and over so often that they've got people believing
them. The public is being programmed to think our vice president is
a laughingstock.''
   The group's first letters were directed at television networks,
but they never got a response. So the group decided to write
individual comics.
   ``He's a human being,'' Mrs. Vallosio said of Quayle. ``We think
our officials have to be superhuman. But everybody makes mistakes.''
   Charlie Barrett, a spokesman for NBC's ``The Tonight Show
Starring Johnny Carson'' _ which features Leno as guest host _ said
the fan club is overreacting to harmless comedic barbs.
   ``A lot of people in the public eye are lampooned by the
media,'' Barrett said. ``It's meant to entertain, no more than
that.''
   Sajak was out of the country and unavailable to comment.
   Quayle spokesman David Beckwith applauded the club's efforts and
suggested Carson and the others take note.
   ``They are perpetuating a stereotype that has no real
correlation with reality,'' Beckwith said in a telephone interview.
``Sometimes, that sort of reputation is hard to shake.
   ``If you're doing a good job as vice president, as Dan Quayle
is, you're not going to get a lot of publicity or get on television
a lot. It's nice the Hit the Trail for Quayle Club is doing
something about it.''

Islamic Hamas movement and a longstanding dissident faction
expressed interest in joining the council.
   Members of the nine Palestine Liberation Organization factions
as well as independent figures made the recommendation after three
days of talks aimed at convening a meeting this year of the
Palestine National Council.
   The National Council functions as parliament for the Palestinian
state it declared two years ago and sets policy for the PLO.
   The National Council speaker, Sheikh Abdul Hamid Al-Sayeh, told
The Associated Press the cuts would come among representatives of
Palestinian refugees living outside Israeli-held territory. Those
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip would retain their 186
seats.
   The recommendation will go before the PLO's Executive Committee.
   Sayeh said the nine factions would hold the same proportion of
seats they do now, with Fatah, led by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat,
holding the largest share.
   He said the fundamantalist movement Hamas, or Zeal in Arabic,
and the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command ``are very much interested in joining the
new council.''
   Hamas has widespread support in the Gaza Strip and West Bank,
where it has sometimes vied with the PLO for leadership of the
28-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
   One sticking point might be the November 1988 PLO decision to
renounce terrorism and accept Israel's right of existence as a step
toward peace talks with Israel aimed at a Palestinian state
alongside the Jewish country.
   Hamas favors struggle to regain all of what is now Israel for
the Palestinians.
   Sayeh said Ahmed Jibril's Syrian-based PFLP-GC also sought
council membership.
   Jibril's relatively small group also has opposed Arafat's
efforts to reach peace through compromise.
   Sayeh said the National Council was due to meet in November.
   He said independents will continue to be allotted 45 percent of
the seats.
   Nominal independents often have been allied with one or another
of the guerrilla factions.

   Sandinista army forces battled
U.S.-supported Contras over the weekend but no casualties were
reported, and rebels were accused of stealing nearly 700 cattle,
the defense ministry said Monday.
   ``The counterrevolutionary forces continue violating the halt to
offensive military operations decreed unilaterally by the
Revolutionary Government of Nicaragua,'' a one-page Defense
Ministry communique said.
   It accused the Contras of ``increasing its terrorist activity
against the civilian population and economic objectives.''
   According to the communique, a group of Contras on Sunday
attacked the farm cooperative ``Dinamita'' southeast of Santo
Domingo in Chontales province. It gave no details.
   Another communique, from the Region V military headquarters in
Juigalpa, said Contra and Sandinista People's Army troops clashed
Saturday near the hamlet of Muhan, also in Chontales.
   Last week, Contra leaders said negotiations to disband the rebel
force stalled because of disagreement over the size of security
zones in Nicaragua and over a verifiable cease-fire.
   The United National Opposition, a pro-American, 14-party
coalition, beat the ruling Sandinistas in Feb. 25 elections and are
to take power on April 25.
   An accord signed by the Contras and UNO in Tegucigalpa on March
23 calls for the rebels to start disarming no later than five days
before President Daniel Ortega hands over power to President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, but sets no deadline for completing
the process.
   The Region V dispatch said the fighting started when about 50
Contras were caught stealing about 500 cattle, but that the army
was able to recover more than 150.
   According to the Defense communique, Contra groups also stole
160 cattle Saturday from the zones of Loma El Turbante and La
Lajas, both in Chontales, and 30 cattle on Friday from an area
known as Cano La Plancha in the South Atlantic Autonomous Region.

   After months of rumors and a complete
overhaul, ``The Pat Sajak Show'' will be yanked off the air
effective April 16, CBS announced Monday.
   The one-hour time slot that begins at 11:30 p.m. will be
replaced with reruns until the fall, when original programming will
be introduced, Rod Perth, vice president of late-night programs,
said in a statement.
   The 15-month-old show, long rumored to be headed for
cancellation, has been at the bottom of late-night talk show
ratings for most of its short life.
   In February, the network gave the show a new look to try to
boost the number of viewers. But a new set and a new format only
produced the same old ratings.
   Sajak, who is more famous as the host of ``Wheel of Fortune,''
will have no further projects with the network, said CBS
spokeswoman Susan Tick.
   Sajak was out of the country on vacation Monday and unavailable
for comment, Ms. Tick said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, the U.S. secretary of health,
said Monday that the United States would end up with more addiction
and more deaths if it ever legalized drugs.
   ``Legalization would be a tragic, horrible mistake, and its
folly has become so apparent that no one should seriously offer it
as an alternative,'' he told a plenary session at a drug summit of
112 nations.
   Sullivan said there was ``a very small but vocal minority'' in
the United States that opposes the war on drugs.
   ``We must beware of those who argue that ending substance abuse
requires too much effort, time and resources,'' he said. ``Some of
these critics claim that legalization is the answer. But, as we
have discovered in the United States, it is no answer at all.''
   Despite the U.S. investment of significant resources in drug
prevention during the 1960s and 1970s, he said, ``those two decades
encouraged pseudo-legalization and social tolerance.''
   ``In the United States, our experience with those two decades
demonstrated the price we will pay for appeasement _ more drugs,
more addiction and more death,'' Sullivan said.
   ``Legalization would remove the stigma from drug use, the
pressure for treatment and the few restraints there are on cost and
supply,'' he said.
   ``Legalization would send the people the message that our
society is morally indifferent to their use of harmful drugs,'' he
said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, opening the three-day
conference, also urged delegates to ``make it absolutely clear that
you can't beat drug-taking by legalizing drugs.''
   ``That is the way to destroy young lives, ruin families and
undermine society itself. Our task is to protect young people, not
deliberately expose them to danger,'' she said.
   ``I can assure you that our government will never legalize
illicit drugs, hard or soft,'' the prime minister said.
   Sullivan said the summit, sponsored by Britain and the United
Nations, had a chance to ``write the final chapter in the horror
story of the world's drug epidemic'' if it fostered an
international commitment to work together to end the drug crisis.
   If this succeeded, he said, ``then we have sent the drug
kingpins and dealers a warning they must heed or face certain doom.
Their days are numbered.
   ``We also will be sending a message to users that they bear
responsibility in perpetuating the drug problem. We must
communicate to users that help is available to them but that they
must seek it,'' he said.

   Four people accused of killing six men and boys
at a reputed crack house in the city's worst mass slaying in nearly
19 years were ordered jailed without bond Monday.
   The four stood mute at their arraignment to six counts each of
felony murder, and a District Court magistrate entered innocent
pleas for them.
   Three of the defendants also were arraigned on one count each of
use of a firearm during commission of a felony in the April 4
slayings.
   Magistrate Izetta Bright ordered Tamara M. Marshall, 18; Mark
Bell, 20; Jamal Biggs 19; and Mark Caison, 19, all of Detroit, held
without bond at the Wayne County Jail, pending a preliminary
hearing April 20.
   Some witnesses said the slayings followed a soured love affair
between Marshall and Steven Owens, at 32 the oldest of the six
victims. Other witnesses said they believed the killings stemmed
from a drug dispute, but Inspector Gerald Stewart dismissed that
speculation again Monday and said robbery appears to be the motive.
   ``We have nothing to indicate this was anything but a straight
robbery of a suspected drug house,'' Stewart, head of the police
department's homicide division, told reporters.
   Three handguns were used in the shootings, Stewart said.
Marshall, Bell and Biggs face the firearms charge.
   The four defendants were arrested over the weekend.
   Witnesses told police a woman and two men burst into the reputed
crack house, forced the victims to lie on the floor and shot each
in the head.
   The victims were identified as Owens, Carl D. Williams, 21,
Bobby Lee Frazier, 16; Robert Lee Hill, 15; LeVon Robinson, 18; and
Rodney Lewis, 22.
   Authorities said it was Detroit's worst mass shooting since June
1971, when seven members of a heroin ring were found shot
execution-style in an apartment.
   Conviction on the felony murder charge is punishable by
mandatory life imprisonment. The felony firearms conviction carries
a mandatory two-year term.

<HEAD>Mugabe Names Three Whites to Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe reshuffled his
Cabinet on Monday, appointing three whites to key posts and
announcing one-time rival Joshua Nkomo will become one of two vice
presidents.
   Rancher and businessman Denis Norman takes over the transport
and national supplies ministry and Dr. Timothy Stamps was named
minister of health, heading a department that must cope with a
growing AIDS epidemic.
   Attorney Chris Andersen, public service minister the past five
years, will move to the economically important mines ministry.
   The moves were part Mugabe's new government. Mugabe's ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) party won a
landslide victory in national elections March 28-30. The new
cabinet was to be sworn in Tuesday.
   Mugabe trimmed his cabinet from 42 to 38 ministers and deputies.
He named as deputy home affairs minister Dumiso Dabengwa, who was
accused of plotting to overthrow Mugabe.
   The home affairs ministry controls the police, its paramilitary
units and internal security.
   Dabengwa, former intelligence chief of Nkomo's Zimbabwe African
People's Union, was jailed without trial from 1982 to 1987 under
Zimbabwe's sweeping state of emergency regulations.
   He was released from detention during talks between the two
rival parties that led to their merger in December 1987.
   Nkomo has served in Mugabe's cabinet as a enior minister for
rural development but his followers have repeatedly sought to
elevate his rank to equal vice president Simon Muzenda, a veteran
Mugabe loyalist.
   Mugabe told reporters the unified party agreed to create the
post of a second vice president of equal rank to Muzenda and both
would be assigned duties by his own office.
   Other key announcements included Sydney Sekeremayi remaining in
the sensitive post of security minister and Nathan Shamuyarira
keeping his position as foreign affairs minister.
   Observers in Harare said the appointment of three whites
appeared to be a gesture of trust in Zimbabwe's 90,000-member white
community.
   Norman was Mugabe's first agriculture minister after the former
British colony of Rhodesia became independent Zimbabwe in 1980.
   But Norman was fired in 1985 because of continued white support
then for the right-wing Conservative Alliance party of former
Rhodesian prime Minister Ian Smith.
   Mugabe said he was angered by what he described as racist
attitudes among whites removed Norman because of it.
   In the March elections, the ruling party won 116 of the 119
contested parliamentary seats, including two by white Mugabe
supporters.
   There was no evidence that white voters supported opposition
parties although the Conservative Alliance openly supported the
opposition Zimbabwe Unity Movement.
   Norman has been closely associated with an organization raising
investment to improve landlocked Zimbabwe's transport links to the
sea through neighboring Mozambique.
   Stamps, a longtime Harare city councilman, inherits the health
ministry, which has been accused of inefficiency and mismanagement
in its awareness campaign to halt the steep increase in the spread
of AIDS.

   A state senator announced Monday that he will

nation's only majority black House district represented by a white.
   Sen. John D. Johnson, 41, a New Orleans Democrat who is black,

has not yet declared herself a candidate, but is expected to seek a
ninth term.
   Mrs. Boggs represents Louisiana's 2nd Congressional District,
which includes most of New Orleans and is the only majority black
House district in the nation represented by a white.
   Johnson served in the Louisiana House from 1980 to 1987 and took
his state Senate seat in 1987.
   He is the first black from New Orleans to serve in both Houses
of the Legislature since Reconstruction.

<TEXT>
   An opposition party treasurer and four
others were arrested Monday on bribery charges in connection with
an investigation into the real estate and construction industry of
this Mediterranean resort.
   District Court No. 2 Judge Luis Manglano ordered the arrests of
Popular Party treasurer Rosendo Naseiro, PP city councilman
Salvador Palop and three businessmen.
   The arrests come days after the Spanish attorney general said he
found no grounds for criminal charges following a two-month
investigation into alleged influence-peddling by the brother of
Socialist Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra.
   The conservative Popular Party has repeatedly called for
Guerra's ouster for allowing his brother, Juan, to allegedly build
a real estate empire while working out of a government office in
southern Seville.
   The so-called ``Juan Guerra scandal'' led to a national debate
over the need for stiffer legislation against influence-peddling.
   The others arrested were Luis Latorre, city architect of
Cullera; Luis Janini, regional director of the Dragados
construction company; Carlos Benett, provincial head of Huarte
construction company; and Jose Balaguer, a local builder.
   Manglano said the five, being held in the Valencia jail, were to
be arraigned Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Jonas Savimbi's U.S.-backed UNITA rebels
on Monday offered an immediate truce and conditional recognition of
the Marxist Angolan state in an attempt to restart talks to end the
15-year-old civil war.
   The rebels proposed direct, closed-door peace talks to be held
in Lisbon. It said Portugal _ the former colonial power in the
southern African state _ can play a ``pivotal role among Angolans
of all political sensibilities.''
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had also called for
direct talks Friday after meeting with three other African heads of
state in the tiny island nation of Sao Tome e Principe.
   UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola, has been fighting the government since shortly after Angola
gained independence in 1975.
   A statement released in Lisbon and signed by Savimbi and other
top-ranking rebel officials announced major concessions to the
government, but promised even fiercer fighting unless peace is
agreed on.
   UNITA said it stood ``ready to cease hostilities immediately and
without preconditions.''
   The rebels earlier had demanded government troop withdrawal from
positions captured in rebel heartlands in southeastern Angola
before agreeing to a truce.
   The statement said UNITA would recognize the Angolan state on
the basis of the Alvor Accords, which in 1975 plotted the course
for independence from Portugal via a power-sharing transitional
government.
   The government demanded full recognition of its authority and
state institutions as part of its latest peace plan, but Monday's
concessions could be enough to tempt the government back to the
negotiating table.
   UNITA pledged in the statement to ``respect all accords signed
over the past 15 years by the MPLA government,'' once free and fair
elections were held in Angola.
   Agostinho Neto's MPLA, or Popular Movement for the Liberation of
Angola, prevailed in the struggle over who would lead Angola
following independence from Portugal. Neto, who died in 1979, was
the first president of independent Angola. The MPLA Party now is
led by Neto's successor, dos Santos.
   Norberto de Castro, the UNITA spokesman in Lisbon, dismissed as
``pure speculation'' news reports after the Sao Tome meeting that
peace talks would start this week in Cape Verde.
   That meeting included presidents dos Santos and Denis Sassou
N'guesso of Congo, Omar Bongo of Gabon and host Manuel Pinto da
Costa of Sao Tome e Principe.
   While inviting the government to talks in Lisbon, the rebels
reaffirmed their support for President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire,
who first brought the two sides together for an initial truce at
Gbadolite last June 22.
   Mobutu's efforts to broker a lasting peace failed after the
cease-fire collapsed. Fighting has intensified recently, including
rebel bombs and sabotage in the Angolan capital Luanda.
   Monday's statement said UNITA was ``determined to act with more
aggression in Luanda'' until a truce is sealed.
   ``If there is no peace, we'll hit where it hurts most,'' it said.
   The rebels also welcomed the ``profound discussion'' of the
Angolan conflict by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze at their meeting
last week in Washington.
   UNITA reportedly receives $50 million or more in U.S. military
aid yearly. U.S. officials estimate Soviet support to the Luanda
government is much higher.

   Police reached the midship cabins of a
burned-out ferry Monday and found families who died together at the
heart of the fire, the bodies of parents lying over children in a
desperate attempt to save them.
   Inspector Leif Skoglund raised the estimated death toll to 170
in the suspicious weekend blaze that destroyed the Norwegian North
Sea ferry Scandinavian Star. He said one victim in every four may
have been a child.
   ``It was incredible,'' he said, groping for words to describe
the scene. ``They are so badly burned.''
   Police in Oslo, Norway, said the death toll could reach 200.
Spokesman Arne Huuse said the figures were unreliable, constantly
changing, and a conclusive count might not be available for days.
   ``We may never find out how many there were because some bodies
are in such bad shape that not even dental records may help,'' said
Dr. Tom Brokopp, leader of the medical rescue team.
   In Britain, police began an arson investigation of a fire on the
Irish Sea car ferry Norrona that killed one man early Monday and
injured 32 people. The Norrona was carrying 297 people from Milford
Haven, Wales, to Rosslare, Ireland.
   Fire also broke out Monday in the engine room of the French
ferry Reine Mathilde 14 miles off the Isle of Wight and England's
south coast, leaving one passenger dead from a heart attack and a
crewman suffering from smoke inhalation. The passenger, 66, was not
identified.
   The blaze aboard the vessel, carrying 675 people from Caen,
France, to Portsmouth, England, was extinguished by the crew, the
coast guard said, but the vessel lost power and would be towed
overnight to Portsmouth.
   A statement from the Norrona owners, the B and I shipping line
of Dublin, said the fire started in two unoccupied sleeping cabins
and arson was suspected.
   A possible link of the Scandinavian Star fire to three ferry
fires last year, including one in September that killed two Swedes,
was being checked.
   Fierce heat on the Scandinavian Star prevented police from
reaching the midship cabins on the third and fourth decks until
nearly 24 hours after the blaze was declared extinguished Sunday.
   Previous estimates that 500 passengers and crew were aboard were
largely guesswork and probably low, Skoglund said, since children
under 7 travel free and would not be listed. ``There were a lot of
families on board,'' he said.
   The fire started before dawn Saturday while the ferry was bound
from Oslo to Frederikshavn, Denmark.
   Police said 93 bodies were removed from the wreckage by dusk
Monday. Most were sent to Oslo for identification.
   Most of the victims were Norwegians and Danes. Four British
citizens and an American singer were among those missing and
presumed dead. The American was identified as Ruth E. Rome, 27,
part of a seven-member song-and-dance troupe from New York City.
   The fire also apparently took the life of Jens C. Hagen, founder
of the ship's operating company.
   ``Things point clearly in the direction of arson,'' said Magnar
Aukrust, assistant police chief of Oslo. ``One survivor has
explained seeing a person putting fire to inflammable material.''
   He did not provide details.
   ``When a fire starts at three places at the same time and on
different decks, it must have been set,'' said the ferry's captain,
Hugo Larsen.
   ``Part of the investigation now is to check thoroughly all
details about previous fires on ferries between Norway and
Denmark,'' Aukrust told The Associated Press in Oslo.
   Leila Freival, the Swedish justice minister, told reporters in
Lysekil, a small port 240 miles from Stockholm, that a joint Nordic
inquiry commission would convene Tuesday in Oslo to investigate the
fire. A separate maritime commission is to begin hearings Wednesday
in Copenhagen, Denmark.
   Criticism was leveled at Larsen and his crew, most of them
Filipino or Portuguese, for allegedly being unprepared for an
emergency.
   Larsen acknowledged in a radio interview that the crew had not
undergone a fire drill; one was scheduled Sunday, he said. The
captain denied allegations the fire alarm failed.
   The first rescue workers to arrive early Saturday told reporters
none of the crew members, including the captain, was on board to
help.
   ``We started searching the boat, but then the fire became so
powerful that we were forced to start fighting the fire,'' said
Svante Carlsson. ``It was unbelievably difficult.''
   ``No one had ever seen anything like it before,'' said Inge
Ingemansson, a Lysekil fireman. ``It was so hot that the water on
board started boiling and the water we sprayed just turned to
steam.''
   The captain denied that leaving his ship was improper. ``I never
failed the passengers,'' he told the TT news agency.
   ``It was only when the flames were around the bridge and we
didn't have a chance to go down to look for more passengers on the
deck that I gave the order to leave the ship.''
   On Swedish television, Larsen said his critics ``should have
been there themselves ... They don't know what they're talking
about.''

   Trombonist Louis Nelson, the last member of
the original Preservation Hall bands, went to his grave in style
Monday in a traditional jazz funeral echoing through the narrow
streets of old New Orleans.
   Nelson, 87, died Thursday, 10 days after a hit-and-run car
accident.
   ``He was really the last of the old crop of trombonists,'' said
Harold Dejan, leader of the Olympia Brass Band which led the
funeral procession. ``There are plenty of imitators, but he was the
last of the good, old crop.''
   The Olympia, normally a dozen or so musicians, was joined by
about two dozen others for the funeral. Among them were visitors
from Australia, Switzerland, and Los Angeles. Butch Thompson,
Nelson's pianist on his last tours to Japan, came from St. Paul,
with cornetist Charley DeVore.
   About 500 people gathered outside the funeral home and followed
the band as it walked the edge of the French Quarter playing old
hymns like ``Sweet Bye And Bye,'' ``What a Friend'' and ``Precious
Lord, Take Me Home.''
   The entourage turned on Bourbon Street and wound through
Nelson's neighborhood of Faubourg Marigny, moving slowly down
narrow streets past bungalows and raised cottages to stop at
Nelson's house.
   To the strains of ``Just a Closer Walk with Thee,'' the band
separated for the hearse to pass and for each musician to touch
goodbye. Two trumpets blew Taps, marking Nelson's tour with the
Navy Band.
   When the tempo lifted for an upbeat version of ``Closer Walk,''
umbrellas _ the traditional ornament of a second line, that joyous
street dance after the funeral _ popped open and the mourners
started clapping in rhythm.
   Then abruptly, an unexpected shift to a waltz. It was ``After
the Ball,'' one of Nelson's favorites. A couple of lilting courses
later, the band drew away the bouncing, shouting crowd with a
raucous ``Saints Go Marching In.''
   The cortege, left by the crowd and the body ``cut loose'' from
earthly friends, made its way to the cemetery, too far away for the
crowd to walk.
   Nelson played many such funerals with many of these musicians.
He worked with Dejan when the Olympia cut its first album of parade
music in 1956.
   Nelson preferred the old-time sweet music, with a sliding
melodic trombone influenced by the swing era, but he could also
play the rough ``tailgate'' style, as he did with the Kid Thomas
Valentine band.
   He was with Kid Thomas when Russell first recorded them in 1949.
He and Thomas were still together in 1961 when they were one of the
bands that opened Preservation Hall, dedicated to keeping
traditional New Orleans music alive.
   Since then, Nelson played with many bands, including George
Lewis, Kid Howard and Billie and DeDe Pierce, and became an
international star, making periodic tours of Europe, South America
and Japan.
   At the time of his death, he was playing two nights a week at
Preservation Hall and was leading The Louis Nelson All Stars, which
was booked for a summer tour of Japan. It would have been his tenth
to that country.
   His last performance was the Saturday before his car was hit by
a woman who ran a red light.
   ``The last night he played, he sounded as good as ever,'' said
jazz historian Bill Russell.

<HEAD>Canada Winds Up Debate on Unpopular Consumption Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons argued into the night Monday
over a 7 percent consumption tax that the Conservative government
of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wants passed despite widespread
protests.
   Monday was the final day of debate set for the goods and
services tax, which prompted at least two defections from
Conservative ranks.
   The levy would take effect Jan. 1.
   The Pro-Canada Network, an umbrella organization of unions,
churches and social lobby groups, asked Canadians to vote against
the tax in a referendum-style protest and in favor of tax reform
based on peoples' ability to pay.
   By 10 p.m. EDT Monday, the lobby's campaign workers reported 2.1
million votes in this nation of 26 million residents asking for the
Conservative government to scrap the tax.
   Government and opposition members of Parliament debating the tax
managed to agree on one thing: parliamentary pages, mostly
university students studying for exams, could go home at 8 p.m.
   That meant legislators had to go get their own water and run
their own errands while votes on amendments dragged on into the
night.
   Passage of the bill would send it to the Liberal-dominated
Senate, which is widely expected to hold another round of hearings
across Canada on the legislation.

<HEAD>Editor Chides Colleagues for Becoming Too Comfortable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's press is too comfortable, too
well-paid, too much part of the establishment for the country's own
good, the president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors
told colleagues April 4.
   ``We often think of ourselves as Davids, fighting the
establishment, but the public sees us more and more as status-quo,
establishment Goliaths,'' said Loren Ghiglione, publisher and
editor of The News of Southbridge, Mass.
   He cited a poll showing most people think that news media are
under the influence of ``powerful people and organizations.''
   Ghiglione, addressing the society's 67th annual meeting,
proposed that editors each ``adopt an institution that makes us
uncomfortable _ a prison, a mental institution, a noisy,
overcrowded, big-city school, an AIDS hospital ward _ and try to
work in that world or at least understand it.''
   He told of his own experiences removing his glasses, his belt,
his watch and his shoes as he was admitted to a number of prisons
in the past year while taking part in an ASNE study of prison
journalism. Each time, he said, he vowed not to do it again, but
``in an era of law-and-order, electric-chair politics, I know I
should go back.''
   ``While we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the
comfortable, we need to guard against looking at the world
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable,'' Ghiglione said,
arguing that newspapermen have lost touch with their readers.
   ``One poll showed that half of newspaper journalists earn over
$40,000 a year, but only 18 percent of the public does,'' he said.
``And many of us live in almost exclusively white, middle-class
worlds and send our children to private or suburban public
schools.''
   He argued that the world needs ``editors who will fight.''
   Another speaker, author and prize-winning reporter David
Halberstam, told the editors that the demands by owners of
newspapers and newspaper company stocks for ever-rising profits are
putting newspapers in jeopardy.
   ``There's a question of how much water you can bring out of the
stone,'' Halberstam said. ``At what point are you taking out more
than you're putting in?''
   ``I think the threat to us is not from the outside, not from the
government, not from television. It is from ourselves.''

<HEAD>Homosexual Staffers Decry Coverage of Gay Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the first survey of its kind, homosexual
members of the staffs of American newspapers said their papers do a
poor job with news about gays or of concern to them.
   The gay journalists said their papers treat them fairly and give
them opportunities to advance, but rarely call on their insights
into gay lifestyles in the same way black reporters are asked to
help guide coverage of black issues.
   And some newsrooms ``harbor a palpable undercurrent of bias,'' a
summary of the findings concludes. One respondent commented that
her colleagues who ``make snide homophobic comments and jokes'' are
``the same people who write those sensitive stories and
editorials!''
   The survey was made public April 4 at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Newspaper Editors. It was undertaken at the
request of outgoing ASNE President Loren Ghiglione, who asked
whether ``anti-gay discrimination infects today's newsrooms.''
   When word of the survey circulated, 205 homosexual members of
the staffs of U.S. newspapers volunteered to respond. Three-fifths
said they were openly gay, and two-thirds signed their
questionnaires.
   Ninety-two percent said they knew other people on the staff who
were gay and the majority of them estimated that fewer than 20
percent of the homosexuals on their papers were openly gay.
   Many experts estimate that one American in 10 is gay.
   ``Why does it matter?'' asked Leroy F. Aarons, an executive of
The Tribune of Oakland, Calif., who coordinated the project. He
said the subject is important because ``more than ever before,
editors are grappling with a swirl of social and political currents
around alternative lifestyle issues.''
   ``Domestic partners legislation, gay adoption,
anti-discrimination laws, fundamentalist attacks on the gay
lifestyle, morality and public responsibility and, of course, the
still-raging AIDS epidemic have brought once-easily ignored issues
into demanding focus,'' he said.
   The respondents gave especially low ratings to the way their
papers treated gay lifestyles, community events and politics, and
only slightly better ratings to treatment of violence against gays,
civil rights issues and legislation.
   As for terminology, nearly a third said they found the term
``homosexual'' to be prejudiced, explaining that it refers narrowly
to sex whereas the term ``gay'' refers to lifestyles or issues.
   Aarons ended his report to the editors by publicly revealing his
own sexual orientation.
   I a paragraph scribbled at the end of his typewritten text and
read hurriedly in a choked voice, he said:
   ``I want you to know that the doing of this report has had
tremendous impact on gay and lesbian journalists across the nation.
It has given them hope and new optimism. It has enhanced their
respect for this organization. I, as an editor and a gay man, am
proud of ASNE.''

<HEAD>Court May Have Opened Door to Bell Electronic Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals says it agrees with
a lower court that the seven Bell operating companies cannot enter
the long-distance or telephone equipment businesses.
   But the April 3 ruling reopens the possibility that the
so-called Baby Bells can sell electronic information services to
homes and offices, a prospect opposed by newspaper groups.
   The decision means that U.S. District Judge Harold Greene must
consider anew whether the Bell companies may be allowed to develop
so-called ``electronic Yellow Pages,'' allowing consumers to shop
and bank _ among other possibilities _ via cheap, easy-to-use video
terminals.
   A prototype, government-operated system in France called Minitel
already serves 5 million homes and offices and offers 8,000
different services.
   The three-judge appeals panel found that Greene ruled correctly
when, in his 1987 ``triennial review'' of the American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. antitrust settlement, he sustained the original order
barring the seven spinoff companies from competing with their
one-time parent in the long-distance and telephone manufacturing
arenas.
   But appeals judges Abner Mikva, Harry Edwards and Laurence
Silberman faulted Greene's legal reasoning when, as part of that
same review, he only partly opened the door for the operating
companies to expand into computer-based information services.
   Greene allowed the Bell companies to offer computer gateways and
access menus for databases and services offered by other companies
_ but not to generate those services themselves. That precluded
them from pursuing a U.S. version of Minitel.

<HEAD>Bill Would Require Editorial Board Members To Disclose Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite warnings that it violates the
U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, a Florida House panel April 4
narrowly approved a bill requiring newspaper editorial board
members to publicly disclose their finances.
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. Bruce McEwan, R-Orlando, would also
make it a second-degree misdemeanor for a newspaper to publish any
editorial unless it is signed by the author.
   A subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee approved the
measure on a 4-3 vote. It would include editorial board members in
a present law requiring state employees to file financial
disclosure forms by July 1 every year or face a possible $5,000
fine.
   One of the 32 co-sponsors of the bill, Rep. Elvin Martinez,
D-Tampa, said the measure is not a vendetta against newspapers but
rather an attempt to shed more light on their role as public
opinion leaders.
   ``The real molder of public opinion is the press,'' Martinez
said. ``They can take you and beat you and do anything to you, and
they're immune. I think people have a right to know if their views
are jaundiced by some financial interest.''
   Barry Richard, attorney for the Florida Press Association, said
the measure clearly infringes on the First Amendment's guarantee of
a free press and would never stand up in court.
   ``The only justification for it is that the person
(editorialist) makes public comment,'' he said. ``Are we next going
to include the League of Women's Voters and other groups in this
category?''
   McEwan said his intention is not to violate the First Amendment.
   ``There's nothing in this bill to prohibit freedom of the
press,'' he said.
   Rep. John Cosgrove, D-Miami and chairman of the Court Systems,
Probate and Consumer Law subcommittee, said some lawmakers
supported the bill simply to take a stab at the press.
   ``As much as I might want to get in there and make a little jab
at editorial boards, I think the greater freedom of expression is
more important,'' Cosgrove said.
   The legislation next moves to the full House Judiciary
Committee, which did not immediately set a date to consider it.
McEwan said he was optimistic of approval.
   Richard was not so sure.
   ``It's press-bashing,'' he said. ``It depends on how many people
are willing to put their names on something that's blatantly
unconstitutional.''

<HEAD>Union Chief Sues Daily News Over Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the mailers union sued the
Daily News, one of its officers and its Chicago-based parent for
$30 million on April 5, claiming they had damaged his reputation as
a labor leader.
   The libel suit, filed by George McDonald, president of the
mailers union and the Allied Printing Trades Council, names John T.
Sloan, the News' vice president for human resources, and the
Tribune Co. It seeks $5 million in compensatory damages and $25
million in punitive damages.
   The 10 unions in the council are involved in tense negotiations
with the News over new contracts; the old contracts expired March
30.
   Sloan said he had not received the suit and thus had no comment.
   According to the suit, McDonald enjoyed a national reputation
``as a dedicated, honest, reputable, loyal and highly competent
labor leader.''
   That reputation was damaged, the suit said, by remarks Sloan
made to the media on March 15 that McDonald gave away work to
another union that traditionally was performed by the mailers union.
   In a related development, Local 3 of The Newspaper Guild asked
that News Publisher James Hoge negotiate directly with the Guild
because the News' negotiators were not familiar with the territory
and the talks were proceeding slowly.
   Robert Ballow, a Nashville, Tenn.-based attorney, has been the
News' lead negotiator.
   Sloan said he did not get an immediate response to the request.

<HEAD>Newspaper Sues Union Official Who Filed Libel Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The San Jose Mercury News on March 29
filed a lawsuit against the former chief of the San Jose hotel
workers union, claiming his 1983 libel lawsuit against the
newspaper was a violation of free press rights.
   The newspaper claimed the lawsuit filed by Frank Marolda damaged
its reputation and is asking for $1 million in damages and recovery
of ``a significant amount'' for legal fees.
   ``It's a combination of abuse of the process and malicious
prosecution,'' said Edward Davis, attorney for the newspaper. ``The
union's lawsuit was designed to send out a message to everyone else
that if you write a negative story about the union, you're going to
be in trouble.''
   In late 1987, a Santa Clara County judge threw out Marolda's
lawsuit against the paper and two of its reporters.
   Marolda, then president of a Hotel and Restaurant Employees and
Bartenders Union local in San Jose, and the union objected to an
article that appeared Oct. 24, 1982.
   The story described Marolda's administration of the union and
his problems connected to a U.S. Senate investigation of labor
corruption.
   The newspaper's suit alleges that Marolda and the union
``brought the action for the purpose of harassing, annoying,
embarrassing, and otherwise oppressing the Mercury News.''

<HEAD>Court Orders IRS To Let Newspaper Co. Depreciate Subscriber Lists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper company can depreciate paid
subscriber lists acquired through the purchase of other publishing
interests, a federal judged ruled April 3.
   The ruling paves the way for the Newhouse family-owned Morning
Ledger Co. of Newark to depreciate $71 million on amended tax
returns, said Donald A. Robinson, the Newark attorney who
represented the Newhouse family.
   Robinson said the company also will collect an undetermined
amount of interest from the Internal Revenue Service on the
previously disallowed depreciation deductions.
   The Newark Morning Ledger Co., owner of The Star-Ledger of
Newark, sued the IRS after the agency refused to let the company
depreciate subscriber lists for eight Michigan papers it acquired
in 1977. Depreciating the lists would decrease the company's
taxable income.
   During the hearing, Morning Ledger attorneys argued that
subscriber lists should be treated like tangible _ and hence
depreciable _ assets because they are used in the taxpayer's
business for a limited period of time.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin agreed with the plaintiffs
that paid subscriber lists are of limited value because subscribers
die, move and cancel subscriptions.
   Sarokin found that even if the circulation of a newspaper
remains constant, the publisher spends a substantial amount of time
and money in advertising and subscription drives to replace lost
customers.
   The government argued that subscriber lists are an intangible
asset that cannot be separated from the company's ``goodwill.''
   If the company were given the depreciation allowance, any
business with paying customers could claim depreciation by saying
the customers have a limited useful life, Gregory Hrebiniak, a
lawyer with the Justice Department's tax division, argued.
   The Morning Ledger company acquired Booth Newspapers, Inc., of
Ann Arbor, Mich., in 1977. The group was worth about $314 million
and had a combined circulation of 460,000, according to the legal
opinion.
   Booth's eight newspapers in Michigan were The Ann Arbor News,
The Bay City Times, The Flint Journal, The Grand Rapids Press,
Jackson Citizen Patriot, Kalamazoo Gazette, The Muskegon Chronicle
and Saginaw News.
   The Morning Ledger's parent company is Advance Publications
Inc., a publishing company owned by the Newhouse family.

<HEAD>Times Herald Editor, in Court, Denounces `Features Grab' by Rival</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of the Dallas Times Herald said April
6 his counterpart at the rival Dallas Morning News ``stalked for
years'' the features that have become the center of a $33 million
antitrust suit.
   ``The features were extremely important but it was the act
itself that was deplorable,'' Times Herald Editor Roy Bode said of
a ``features grab'' by the Morning News and its editor, Burl
Osborne.
   Bode's remarks drew immediate objections from Morning News
attorneys. Osborne denied the characterization.
   ``I have no recollection of ever aggressively pursuing their
package,'' he said during testimony as a hostile witness called by
Times Herald attorneys.
   The Times Herald is seeking the $33 million and unspecified
punitive damages from the Morning News and parent company A.H. Belo
Corp.
   A joint venture between Belo and Universal Press Syndicate Inc.
left the Times Herald without comics and columns that included Dear
Abby, Erma Bombeck and Doonesbury _ all distributed by Kansas
City-based UPS.
   Belo and Universal Press announced their venture, Universal
Belo, to develop syndicate features for television use. Osborne
said the shift of the entire UPS package to his newspaper was a
condition required by the syndicate.
   The Times Herald alleges the venture and the transfer of the
features violated antitrust laws and was an attempt to create a
monopoly and drive the Times Herald out of business.
   The trial began April 2 and is expected to last at least a month.

<HEAD>Chronicle Loses Bid To Block Ad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on April 2 ruled that Attorney
General John Van de Kamp may use San Francisco Chronicle articles
in a TV commercial for his gubernatorial campaign despite the
paper's objection that such use implied an endorsement.
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin denied a Chronicle request to
bar use of the newspaper's name in the commercial.
   ``I suspect it (the ad) comes dangerously close to creating a
false impression that that is the Chronicle speaking,'' Vukasin
said.
   But he said the Van de Kamp campaign properly identified itself
as the sponsor of the commercial and was clearly quoting the
Chronicle as a source of information.
   Neil Shapiro, a lawyer for the Chronicle, said the newspaper
still may sue for damages.
   The ad attacks former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, Van
de Kamp's rival for the Democratic nomination, over her management
of the city. Each subject is illustrated by a Chronicle clipping
about a controversy. The paper's name appears several times at the
bottom of the screen.
   The Chronicle sued to stop the use of its name and masthead,
saying the ad violated the newspaper's trademark and was meant to
mislead.
   ``If we wish to endorse someone, we will, but we don't want
somebody stealing the endorsement,'' Shapiro told the judge.
   Saying some angry readers had telephoned the paper to complain
about its apparent endorsement, the lawyer declared that the ad
``confuses people into believing the Chronicle supports, endorses
or even prepared'' it.
   But Kantor said Van de Kamp had an obligation, as well as a
constitutional right, to quote the Chronicle as the source of
material in his commercial.

   U.S.-based journalists at the news agency
Reuters withheld their bylines from stories for three days to
protest management contract proposals.
   The byline strike, which began April 2, was organized by The
Newspaper Guild, which represents about 500 Reuters employees
around the country, including 150 journalists. Their contract
expired Feb. 28.
   ``We hope this action will impress management with our anger
that a company making so much money wants to severely cut the
benefits and pay of those who are crucial to Reuters' success,''
said Barry Lipton, president of the Guild local.
   Lipton said the company's offer of a 2.5 percent raise would be
offset by a proposed weekly increase of work time from 33.75 hours
to 37.5 hours, with no overtime until after 40 hours.
   The company has also proposed having employees pay for part of
the cost of health insurance.
   Reuters, in a statement, cited the rising cost of health care
and said the company's benefits ``will remain competitive by all
industry standards.''

<HEAD>Hourly Newspaper Launched Aboard Pan Am Shuttle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Latest News, a 24-page tabloid billed as
the nation's first hourly newspaper, made its debut April 2 on a
mid-afternoon flight from Washington to New York.
   The paper will be available on Pan Am shuttles originating at
National Airport from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., on the theory that
corporate passengers have been starved all day for news.
   The paper is updated hourly with copy from United Press
International and States News Service to provide breaking news,
business developments and weather reports. Advertising is sold by
Financial World magazine.
   The partners plan to expand distribution to Boston and New York
after a test period. They also are considering heavily traveled air
routes between Los Angeles and San Francisco, Chicago and St.
Louis, and Houston and Dallas.
   ``A radio station in print'' is how editor and publisher Leland
Schwartz described the venture in a front-page letter to readers in
the first edition of the first issue.
   ``There are critics who think we're crazy,'' Schwartz admitted
in the article. But he noted that the same people returning to New
York ``were so hungry when you came down to Washington this
morning, the shuttle was a sea of newspapers.''
   The maiden 3:30 p.m. edition contained front-page articles on
the New York and Tokyo stock markets and a list of headlines to
stories on inside pages. Featured inside were news briefs, sports
briefs, 1 p.m. stock data and the latest filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as short stories on the
top news of the day.

Hammell Newspapers of Oklahoma Inc. to the Alva Newsgram, a
free-circulation daily.
   The April 2 announcement did not list specifics of the agreement.
   The Newsgram was started by Lynn and Marione Martin in 1970 as a
promotional tool for KALV radio, which the couple purchased in
1969. They retained the paper after selling the station two years
ago.
   The magazine-sized Newsgram will continue unchanged four days
per week and will publish jointly with the daily Review-Courier on
Thursday and Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Splatter!, a new low-budget children's
magazine, was launched April 2 by two Yale students seeking to give
New Haven youngsters a fun way to learn creative writing.
   The inaugural edition, printed with a copying machine, included
short stories, poems, drawings, plays and essays written by
students from area middle schools as well as by some Yale students.
   Copies were distributed free to middle school students.
   Co-founders and editors Jessica Plumb and Jessica Reich, both
sophomores at Yale, said they hoped the publication would become a
permanent part of the university's outreach programs.
   Dozens of students submitted articles for the first issue,
ranging from a short story about a girl who was granted three
wishes to an account of life in a drug-plagued neighborhood.

<HEAD>The Times' Letters Editor Reflects on 11 Years at the Mailbag</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This is not a great age of correspondence, says
the recently retired editor of The Times' venerable letters column,
though the mailbags still bulge with opinions both profound and
eccentric.
   ``There are many people who simply do not know how to put words
onto paper; they have to become so used to talking on the telephone
or dictating into machines and having them tidied up by their
secretaries,'' Leon Pilpel said in an interview published April 4
by The Times.
   ``Of the 300 letters a day, only about 8 percent are
publishable. I am not talking about matters of syntax, but about
importance, or (fitness).
   ``Many of them are pretty mundane, although frequently half a
dozen not very brilliant ones can be made into a very good
correspondence indeed _ with a bit of judicious editing, and the
specific approval of the letter-writer.''
   Great debates have been waged in the sober letters columns of
The Times, leavened with whimsical bits of English life, such as
the sighting of the first cuckoo of spring.
   Pilpel, who is taking up new duties as a deputy ombudsman at the
paper, joined The Times 40 years ago and became letters editor in
1979.

<HEAD>Paper Barred From Concert After Column Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A representative of Paul McCartney was angered by
a column in The Arizona Republic critical of the musician's work
and ordered the newspaper banned from an April 4 news conference
and concert.
   The Republic's writers were able to cover the concert because
the paper had purchased tickets for the sold-out performance at
Arizona State University. But the ban meant the newspaper was
unable to photograph either the evening concert or a news
conference before it. The newspaper obtained photographs of the
concert from The Associated Press.
   Republic staff member Dennis Love, who'd written the column, was
barred from entering the news conference by Geoff Baker,
McCartney's tour publicist.
   The Republic said it did not know whether McCartney approved or
even knew of the ban.
   ``Dennis Love's column was merely an effort to provide the
diversity of opinion that is in the best tradition of good
journalism,'' said Robert Franken, a Republic assistant managing
editor. ``We've provided a lot of positive publicity about this
concert, including an entire section last month, and we're frankly
surprised that one writer's personal opinion would be reason to
exclude all Republic coverage. We don't see how that helps anyone.''
   Love's column, published April 3, questioned McCartney's talents
and abilities since the Beatles' breakup, contended that his
post-Beatles music is ``schlock,'' and added that it is possible he
was not a major contributor to the Beatles' success.

<HEAD>Nine Officers Disciplined for Harassing Reporters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORWALK, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nine Norwalk police officers have been
disciplined for harassing journalists covering the court appearance
of a fellow officer charged in an accidental shooting death, the
city's police chief said April 3.
   Officers allegedly bumped, butted and tossed a snowball at
reporters and photographers outside Norwalk Superior Court on Jan.
4, when Officer David Russo appeared on a misdemeanor charge of
unlawful discharge of a weapon.
   Officer Michael Price was put on departmental probation for six
months and ordered to forfeit two vacation days for throwing the
snowball, Police Chief Carl LaBianca said.
   The eight other officers received verbal reprimands for being at
the courthouse without permission.
   Russo accidentally shot 19-year-old Ernest Gainor in the back
with a shotgun after an Oct. 26 car chase. Gainor later died. Russo
was sentenced to one year probation on the misdemeanor charge.
   Steve Meyerson, a cameraman for Cablevision News 12 in Norwalk,
complained that officers hip-checked him as he carried about 72
pounds of camera equipment. Photographer Brian Poulter of The
Advocate newspaper of Stamford said one officer bumped his chest
against his.
   LaBianca said he considered the nine officers' length of service
and service records in deciding the disciplinary measures.

<HEAD>Voters Protest Story About Candidate's Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper story about a school board
candidate's unpaid property taxes drew protesters to a sidewalk
outside the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram on March 29 and 30.
   Demonstrators said the article was a calculated attack on David
Flynn, who was running for re-election to the school board. Flynn
lost in the April 3 race.
   Four people picketed the newspaper March 29 and five March 30.
   James Price of Eleva, who organized the picketing, said Flynn
was typical of many Wisconsin farmers unable to keep up with taxes.
Price said the newspaper should have waited until after the
election to run the story.
   An article March 28 said Flynn owed Eau Claire County $18,920 in
property taxes and owed $3,383 in back taxes in neighboring Dunn
County.
   Editor Eugene Ringhand said the newspaper discovered information
for the story earlier in the week.
   ``The voters place an enormous amount of trust in public
officials,'' he said. ``Reporting information that could bear on
that trust is necessary for voters to make an informed choice and
weigh the value of that information against the potential benefit
of a candidate.''

<HEAD>Blacks Accuse Newspaper of Racism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 100 pickets marched in front of the
Philadelphia Daily News on April 4 to protest what they they called
racism on the part of the newspaper and negative coverage of the
black community.
   The paper's editor denied the claims, pointing to the Daily
News' record of minority hiring and support for the community.
   The marchers, including city Councilman Lucien E. Blackwell, a
likely candidate for mayor in 1991, asked blacks to cease buying
the newspaper.
   They said the newspaper overemphasizes crime news involving
black people; presents a distorted picture of blacks in the city;
ignores positive news involving blacks; and is overly aggressive
and racially motivated in covering black officials.
   ``We're not trying to shut it down,'' said attorney Charles
Bowser, who led the march. ``We're not trying to change the paper.
We just want to get African-Americans to stop buying it. If they
can sell it to other people and keep going, fine.''
   Daily News Editor Zachary Stalberg denied the charges.
   ``I reject completely the idea of the Daily News as racist, and
I particularly object to the notion that our political or
government coverage is biased in any way,'' Stalberg said.
   In a note to readers, Stalberg said the Daily News has attracted
the largest minority audience of any big city paper in the nation.
He also noted the paper's record in hiring and promotion, and its
1988 endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson for president.
   ``The News has made some blood enemies. That is because it is
visceral and two-fisted and enjoys feasting on phonies and bungling
politicians,'' Stalberg wrote.
   He also said Bowser had been offered space in the Daily News to
state his case, but failed to take advantage of it.

   The news agencies of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
have agreed to create a news service called Baltija, the official
Soviet news agency Tass reported April 5.
   The agency intends to transmit reports ``that are not influenced
by any party, organization or public movement,'' Tass said.
   Such cooperation among the three Soviet Baltic republics has
been relatively rare, although some economists predict if they gain
full independence from the Soviet Union they will band together in
an economic bloc.
   The Latvian agency Leta, Lithuanian agency Elta and Estonian
agency Eta signed the agreement Thursday to establish a joint

   The service will function both inside and outside the Baltic

   Czechoslovakia's best-read

   Despite police harassment, Lidove Noviny (People's News) had
circulated monthly since December 1987. It carried frequent

now Czechoslovakia's president, and Jiri Dienstbier, now foreign

drive and German reunification plans.
   The paper will remain politically and commercially independent,

<HEAD>Newspaper Demands Protection From Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers killed up to 10 police
officers and wounded at least eight April 2 and 3 in Colombia's
cocaine capital of Medellin, and a leading Bogota newspaper left
its editorial column blank to protest threats from the traffickers.
   The government of President Virgilio Barco pressed on in its
U.S.-backed war against the drug dealers. It announced it would
soon extradite three more drug suspects, including a congressman,
El Tiempo newspaper reported.
   The attacks came after the Medellin cartel threatened to resume
killing government officials, judges, policemen and the owners of
Colombia's second-largest newspaper, El Espectador of Bogota.
   On April 3, the morning daily said in a front-page statement it
would suspend its entire editorial column until the government
gives the paper adequate protection.
   The editorial column, often filled with denunciations of
traffickers, was a strip of blank, white paper two columns wide and
12 inches long.
   The Medellin cartel killed El Espectador's publisher, Guillermo
Cano, in a submachine-gun attack in 1987. In the past four months,
six El Espectador employees have been killed by hit squads.

<HEAD>Students Protest Comic's Violent Fantasy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student comic strip depicting a violent
sexual fantasy is ``going too far,'' says the chairman of a group
of University of Illinois women.
   The Chancellor's Committee on the Status of Women is urging
readers of The Daily Illini, which carried the comic strip, to
cancel their subscriptions.
   ``We don't want sex and violence confused in anyone's mind,''
said committee chairwoman Michele Shoresman. ``We've got to stop
this.''
   Managing Editor Dan Bernard defended the cartoonist, saying,
``His goal definitely was to promote awareness of insincerity.''
   The cartoon strip appeared over two days March 27 and March 28
and was drawn by student Mark Peaslee.
   The first strip depicts a conversation between a man and woman
over exams. Another balloon depicts the man's thoughts, reading
``Censored thoughts of degradation, pain and eventual death.''
   After the man leaves, the woman says, ``What a nice guy.''
   The second strip shows another conversation and this time
focuses on the woman's thoughts, reading, ``Hmm... Wonder what
you'd look like...'' and goes on to describe a fantasy involving
bondage and mutilation.
   ``What they did is dangerous because the sarcasm didn't work,''
said committee member Mary Ellen O'Shaughnessey, assistant dean of
students.

<HEAD>Iowa State Journalist Demoted for Comments on Coeds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iowa State University student journalist
who wrote that ISU coeds are big and strong but not very
good-looking will keep his column but was removed from the paper's
editorial board.
   Reed Landberg, editor of the Iowa State Daily, said April 2 the
demotion means columnist David Young, a junior from Omaha, Neb., no
longer will write news stories for the paper.
   Landberg said Young may continue writing his ``Facing Reality''
column but that the uncomplimentary view of Iowa State women in a
recent column forced the paper to take disciplinary action.
   Young wrote that Iowa State coeds are ``a breed which has led to
the coining of such terms as `Moo U' and the `Iowa Hip Disease.' ''
   He also said the coeds are muscle-bound.
   ``Unless a male student has a sick desire for farm women who are
bigger and stronger than the East German Women's Olympic Team, he
is likely out of luck,'' he wrote.
   Landberg said Young was one of the paper's best writers but that
many readers assume his writing is biased because of the column.
   ``The mistake in printing Young's last column was not solely his
own,'' Landberg wrote April 3, saying he had an advance copy of the
column. ``It was mine, too, and I must stand behind him for that.''

<HEAD>Winning Teen Essay Disqualified for Copying `Calvin and Hobbes'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winner of the Florida Young
Writers Contest was disqualified after it was learned that the
beginning of his winning story was an exact copy of three panels of
a ``Calvin and Hobbes'' comic strip.
   Jeffrey Wright, 17, a senior at Fletcher High School, said April
2 the plagiarism was unintentional. He said he keeps notebooks
filled with story ideas and sometimes jots down passages he reads.
   ``If someone took something of mine, I'd be upset. It's wrong. I
know I owe everyone an apology,'' Wright said.
   The story, titled, ``Tracer Bullet,'' describes a child playing
detective while cleaning his room. Tracer Bullet also was the name
of the character in the ``Calvin and Hobbes'' strip.
   The first four paragraphs of Wright's story had appeared in The
Florida Times-Union on April 2 with the announcement that he had
won, and a caller pointed out the duplication to Mike Clark, the
newspaper's reader advocate.
   Wright also lost a $1,000 scholarship to the University of North
Florida, which sponsored the contest along with the Times-Union.

<HEAD>Restauranteur or Restaurateur?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restaurateur by any spelling, whether
with an ``n'' or without, is not a favorite word of keepers of the
language, according to a survey released April 3.
   But if they have to use the word for keeper of a restaurant,
they'll take it without the ``n,'' said respondents to the 12th
English-language usage survey by the Indiana University School of
Journalism.
   ``Many in the survey found it stuffy no matter how it is
spelled, though its use is patently expanding in this country,''
wrote Professor Richard L. Tobin.
   The 10-question survey was mailed to 100 newspaper copy editors
and 50 magazine editors in the United States and Canada and got a
60 percent return, Tobin said.
   ``The consensus throughout this year's survey was mighty close
to unanimous in almost every example, which just goes to show that
copyreaders know what they're doing and do it like the sterling
language-usage guardians they are put there to be,'' the survey
said.
   Nearly all editors agree ``percent'' should be one word and not
two.
   Most editors agreed the region Deep South should be uppercase.
   Most copy desks caught the misuse of ``tremblor'' instead of
``temblor,'' in a line from a Maryland newspaper reporting a Palm
Springs earthquake.
   Most changed ``forego'' to ``forgo'' in the sentence: ``The
university decided to forego the traditional faculty banquet
because of the financial situation.''
   Copy desks were asked whether ``gibe'' or ``jibe'' was correct
in the following sentence: ``Three suspects were taken to police
headquarters but detectives announced later that their stories
didn't gibe.'' The verdict was almost unanimous that ``jibe'' was
correct.
   ``Complacent'' was correctly preferred over ``complaisant'' in
an item saying a soccer team had become ``complaisant'' after four
straight victories.
   Editors chose ``theretofore'' over ``hitherto'' in the sentence:
``In 1864, President Lincoln spent the hitherto unheard of sum of
$3,000,000 on naval construction.''
   Almost no one chose ``peddle'' over ``pedal'' in the final
question, which came from a Florida sports page: ``When you're
riding a bicycle you use the brake and the peddle with caution on
today's highways.''

   The Marion County grand jury investigating the killing of state

   The newspaper of the Seminole tribe said
April 4 it is challenging a Pulitzer Prize rule that limits entries
for the journalism prize to newspapers that publish at least once a
week.
   An entry submitted by The Seminole Tribune on new evidence in
the case of a convicted mass murderer was disqualified last year
because the tribal newspaper appears twice a month, Editor Twyla
Perkins said.
   The United Southern and Eastern Tribes, an Indian group
representing 18 tribes in the Southeast, has called for a rule
change, and the board of the Native American Press Association has
been asked to do the same, Perkins said.
   ``We're disqualified because of that rule,'' she said. ``There's
nothing we could do to get ourselves back in there.''
   Pulitzer awards administrator Robert Christopher said the line
has to be drawn somewhere on the frequency of publication, and
there are no current plans for a change.
   James Richardson served more than two decades in state prison in
the killing of his seven children before evidence uncovered by
Tribune reporter Pete Gallagher and free-lance writer Charles
Flowers led to his release.
   The reporters' work received widespread attention after The
Miami Herald published their story in its ``Tropic'' Sunday

<HEAD>Federal Charges Dropped, Replaced by State Prosecution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A freelance journalist April 6 pleaded
innocent to state charges related to computer hacking after U.S.
prosecutors decided not to try him for allegedly attempting to
steal information from a TV tabloid show.
   The reporter, Stuart Goldman, 44, was charged with seven felony
counts of violating a California Penal Code section prohibiting
unauthorized access to computers.
   Goldman allegedly used another person's access code to enter a
computer used by the Fox Television show ``A Current Affair'' at
the network's Hollywood television station, KTTV, said Sandi
Gibbons, spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office.
   Information was allegedly taken out of the computer through a
telephone connection and stored in Goldman's home computer.
   Last month, federal prosecutors filed an affidavit in U.S.
District Court in New York stating that the reporter had tried to
gain access to computer files concerning news stories that Fox
reporters were working on.
   U.S. prosecutors would not say why the New York case was
dropped. A Fox spokesman, Dennis Petroskey, would not comment on
the case.
   Goldman's attorney, Alan Rubin, said he had persuaded the U.S.
attorney's office in New York to drop the federal charges there.
   Goldman briefly worked for ``A Current Affair'' as well as
``Hard Copy,'' a competitor's show. He has written articles for
National Review magazine, the Los Angeles Times and other
publications.
   If convicted of all the state charges, Goldman could be
sentenced to a maximum of six years in prison.

<HEAD>Stock Exchanges' Plan Could Raise Price Tag for Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small investors and the media could face higher
costs for their daily diet of stock prices under a proposal by the
nation's stock exchanges that could lead to new fees for market
data.
   A group of news organizations, discount stock brokerages and
database services is challenging the request for a contractual
change that could open the door to charges on 15-minute-old stock
quotes.
   Delayed last sale information, as it is called, is now free to
vendors, except for transmission costs. Charges are applied only to
``real-time'' quotes, which are up-to-the-second prices. Individual
investors pay about $13 a month for real-time quotations from the
New York Stock Exchange. Institutions can pay up to $120 a month.
   The stock exchanges say they own the data, real or delayed, and
need to recover the costs of compiling and distributing it.
   Opponents of the proposal by the NYSE and seven other exchanges,
pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission, said April 6
that delayed-price fees would drive investors who can't afford to
pay for real-time data from the markets. They said the
15-minute-old numbers are public property.
   ``It's like charging for the wrapper on the candy after it's
been eaten,'' said Hugo Quackenbush, spokesman for discount broker
Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
   But Thomas Haley, the NYSE's vice president for market data,
said the exchanges already have the right to charge for delayed
data and to alter the definition of delayed data.
   Haley said charging some users for stock-price quotations and
giving it away free to others is unfair and should be reconsidered.
   ``The exchange and the CTA receives nothing, zero, from those
organizations for the use of that data,'' he said. ``That operation
is being subsidized by all the others who are paying.''
   With the development of lightning-quick transmission capability
and competing computer databases in the last decade, more and more
businesses are using the stock exchange's free data.
   Haley said the NYSE has 134 contracts to provide delayed data to
vendors, who in turn make it available to an estimated 1.5 million
personal users. He said about 200,000 display units have access to
real-time data.
   The Associated Press is one of a dozen groups that have objected
to the exchanges' proposal. In addition to Schwab and Quick &amp;
Reilly, others include Financial News Network, Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
Fidelity Investments and Instinet Corp.

<HEAD>Businessman Takes Aim at Fast-Food Fat Content</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A businessman who lobbies against
heart-threatening foods used full-page ads in The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times, USA Today and more than a dozen other
major newspapers April 4 to take on McDonald's Corp. and other
fast-food companies.
   Phil Sokolof, a retired Omaha millionaire who has waged a
one-man campaign against highly saturated fats in processed foods,
called on McDonald's and other restaurants to reduce the fat
content of their hamburger meat by 10 percent.
   About five newspapers declined to run the ad, which also attacks
Burger King, Wendy's and other restaurants, Sokolof said.
   McDonald's reacted with outrage.
   ``I think this kind of advertising is sensational, ridiculous,
and I think it's reckless,'' McDonald's senior vice president Dick
Starmann said from Oak Brook, Ill.
   Sokolof, 67, blames high cholesterol for a near-fatal heart
attack he suffered 24 years ago. He started the National Heart
Savers Association in 1985 and supports it largely through his own
contributions.
   After he launched a national advertising campaign in 1988, nine
major food processors, including Nabisco, Kellogg's, Pepperidge
Farm and Keebler agreed to begin phasing out cholestorol-elevating
fats from products such as crackers, cookies, candies, cereals,
cooking ingredients and TV dinners.
   Starmann said the Big Mac had less saturated fat in it than the
ad claimed.
   A Big Mac with french fries contains about 19 grams of saturated
fat, he said. McDonald's uses a combination of beef tallow and
vegetable shortening to cook its fries and is testing
cholesterol-free vegetable shortening that would eliminate beef
tallow, he added.
   The company has introduced low-fat and low-cholesterol bran
muffins and cereals to its menu, Starmann added.

Cuba will retaliate for the U.S. propaganda channel ``TV Marti,''
especially since a recent warning shot that was heard as far away

   Radio station operators and engineers at the National
Association of Broadcasters convention said they were concerned
about reports that Cuba may have radio transmitters capable of 1

AM stations.
   Cuba has been jamming the TV Marti broadcasts, produced by the

Fidel Castro warned April 3 that any U.S. attempt to interfere with
the jamming could lead to war.
   The warning shot that has broadcasters worried came on March 23,
four days before testing of TV Marti began.
   Federal Communications Commission monitors heard Cuban radio
signals on six clear-channel, U.S. AM frequencies, said Walter W.
Wurfel, senior vice president of the NAB.
   A half-dozen AM stations in Florida battled with the
interference, and stations in Red Springs, N.C., and Donelson,
Tenn., filed complaints, Wurfel said.
   The interference even turned up in Salt Lake City, said John
Dehnel, chief engineer at that Utah city's clear-channel KSL-AM.
   ``If Castro fires up his AM radio transmitters, it poses a
substantial potential to interrupt and cause interference to a lot
of radio stations in the United States _ perhaps 1,000 to 1,500,''
Wurfel said.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Backs Industry Self-Regulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfred Sikes, chairman of the Federal
Communications Commission, reiterated support for self-regulation
of radio and television April 4, but pledged not to permit
``regulatory neglect'' when rules and practices hamper competition.
   ``Now more than ever,'' Sikes said in a speech to a National
Association of Broadcasters meeting, ``the future of your industry
lies within your hands.''
   Under Sikes, the FCC has increased enforcement of
``anti-indecency'' laws. Some in the industry have called content
regulation unconstitutional.
   ``The constitution clearly limits government, and that's how it
should be,'' said the FCC chairman, who once operated a Missouri
radio station.
   ``Yet it is nevertheless true that a broadcast industry whose
standards are no higher than its lowest common denominator not only
ill-serves our nation but it also risks arousing an already too
cynical public and invites more governmental intrusion.''

<HEAD>Musburger Says Farewell to CBS After Championship Broadcast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brent Musburger, whose 15-year career at CBS ended
April 2 when the network declined to renew his contract, blames the
breakup on two former bosses.
   In an interview on ABC's ``PrimeTime Live'' on April 5,
Musburger said that CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and executive
producer Ted Shaker ``conspired to get me out of CBS.''
   ``It was not a network firing,'' Musburger said in an interview
with Sam Donaldson. ``It was a personal vendetta on the part of two
people. ... These two men had decided I was too big for my britches
and that they were just going to take me down a peg or two.''
   Shaker and Pilson each issued one-sentence responses through CBS
spokeswoman Susan Kerr.
   ``It was disappointing to watch,'' Pilson said.
   ``I wish to remember Brent the way he was (on his final
broadcast for the network April 2), gracious and professional,''
Shaker said.
   Jack Buck replaced Musburger as the network's top baseball
announcer and CBS filled Buck's spot on the second unit with Dick
Stockton.
   CBS Sports executive producer Ted Shaker said the network has
also talked with ABC's Al Michaels, NBC's Bob Costas and Vin
Scully, a free agent who left NBC during the winter.

   Ten small newspapers were cited April 4 as
examples of excellence by the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Chosen from newspapers with less than 50,000 circulation were:
The Bradenton (Fla.) Herald; Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo.; The
Times in Gainesville, Ga.; Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald; La Crosse
(Wis.) Tribune; The Capital Times in Madison, Wis.; The Sun News in
Myrtle Beach, S.C.; Naples (Fla.) Daily News; The Day in New

   ``I think this is one of the most thorough evaluations of small
newspapers ever undertaken,'' said Jim Herman, editor of the

society's project on excellence in small newspapers.
   ``Our goal is to find small newspapers that are doing

   Herman said ASNE's selection process began last fall when 1,356
small daily newspapers were invited to compete. More than 450
newspapers were submitted for consideration and regional judges

   In January, 13 judges gathered at the Poynter Institute in St.

   That would give Iran-Contra prosecutors their first opportunity

   Poindexter is a candidate for a grand jury appearance following
his sentencing June 11 on his convictions Saturday for conspiracy,
obstruction and lying to Congress, say the sources, speaking on

   There was a time when the British band
Marillion performed poetic tales of midlife crisis, tragic love
affairs, politics and alcoholism that bordered on the negative.
   But these days, with a new optimism and a new lead singer, the
group sings of strife in Northern Ireland in the elegant track
``Easter,'' of love gone obsessive in ``The Uninvited Guest'' and
of global warming in the title track of ``Seasons End,'' their new
LP.
   ``I'm trying to deal with all of those things on a soul level,
on a humanity level, rather than trying to make some kind of
political point,'' said Steve Hogarth, who replaced the
introspective Derek Dick, who was called Fish, as vocalist and
lyricist.
   ``I think it's a great romantic notion to turn all the poets
into politicians,'' he said. ``I don't think it's our place or
musicians' place to stand up and propose solutions other than to
propose hope and to propose the wider and more common sense things
like love and peace.''
   That attitude carries over in Marillion's live performances.
Hogarth is engaging on stage, leaping on to speaker cabinets to
sing and making frequent eye contact with his audience.
   ``I try to be a bit friendly,'' he said. ``I try and love them _
I know that sounds like an insincere American sort of thing to say,
but I do try in all sincerity to love them while I'm singing to
them. I think that you've got to put something out to people to get
something back from them that is genuine.''
   Though popular in England for about a decade, Marillion is just
beginning to gain an audience in the United States.
   The group started in 1978 as Silmarillion, a name taken from the
J.R.R. Tolkein novel. Their leader was the enigmatic Fish. Others
in the band were guitarist Steve Rothery, bassist Pete Trewavas,
keyboardist Mark Kelly and drummer Ian Mosley.
   They released their first album, ``Script for a Jester's Tear''
in 1983 under their new name _ Marillion.
   Through 1988, Marillion released six albums. Their most notable
efforts with Fish were the brilliant concept works ``Misplaced
Childhood,'' released in 1985, and ``Clutching at Straws,'' in 1987.
   Fish left the band in 1988 and was replaced in 1989 by Hogarth,
who had been in several lesser bands around Britain. Fish has just
released a solo album, ``Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors,'' which
is already in the Top 10 in Britain.
   Hogarth was familiar with the band's material before he joined,
but didn't know the group was looking for a new singer until his
publisher told him.
   ``I'd never seen the band play and I wasn't a member of the fan
club or anything, so I didn't understand the band in terms of how
they actually are as people,'' Hogarth said in a telephone
interview following a concert stop in Philadelphia.
   But the connection between Hogarth and the rest of Marillion was
immediate.
   ``They all knew straight off that it was right _ they don't know
why. I think they just got the feeling that I was coming from the
same planet in terms of what stimulated me,'' Hogarth said.
   The band had been looking for someone ``who's just going to be
himself,'' he said, and they were more than willing to use music he
had written.
   ``I think that's why spiritually the band feels so new,''
Hogarth said, ``because it has been a natural process. We haven't
taken anything that was old and tried to chisel away at what's new
in order to make it fit.''
   However, Fish's departure was a strain on both sides, Hogarth
said.
   ``The band were beginning to have a problem with the stuff Fish
was writing, as well as Fish was beginning to have a problem with
wanting to work with the band,'' Hogarth said.
   ``The problem the band were having with his writing was that he
was beginning to be so introverted that the band were beginning to
worry that nobody else in the world was ever going to relate to
what he was going on about.''
   Hogarth said it was a happier band that recorded ``Seasons End.''
   ``We had a great time writing the album, and then a great time
recording it because we co-produced it,'' Hogarth said. ``We didn't
have anyone telling us what to do when we were recording the album,
so the spirit right from day one has been extremely positive, and I
think it's reflected not only in the album but in the spirit on
stage and the live shows as well.''
   Hogarth thinks the band can make it in the United States, but
will have to do it through touring ``because nobody's ever go records to
death on daytime rading to
play ourio _ that's not the kind of
band we are _ and in a way, that's our strength.''
   But in a way, the singer appreciates the band's anonymity.
   ``We're in the fortunate position that our record company hasn't
the foggiest idea why our fans love it, and so they leave us to
just get on with it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Japanese Companies Add Flexibility to Robotic Assembly Lines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZAMA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty-five robot arms hold the main parts of
a Nissan Sentra body in virtually perfect alignment and 16 others
weld the parts together in 62 spots.
   Then, 45 seconds later, everything changes. The four-door sedan
body moves on, a computer automatically readjusts the bank of
robots to assemble the next item on the line, a hatchback.
   After the computer does its work again, the robots assemble the
body of a station wagon.
   Down the line, each body will be painted a different color and
receive different parts, all determined by computer command.
   Japanese companies are increasing the flexibility of production
lines to handle a mix of models and options and permit easy
changeover to new designs.
   In selling his Model T, the world's first mass-produced car,
Henry Ford offered ``any color you want, as long as it's black.''
Japanese companies, in contrast, are using computerization to focus
on ``miniproduction'' that offers specialized, low-volume models
and even custom jobs.
   Toyota makes Supra, Lexus and Soarer models on the same line in
its Tahara plant. Honda produces Accords and Integras on a single
line at Suzuka.
   Each car at the Tahara factory carries a specially programmed
identification disk. It emits radio signals picked up by receivers
at each work station, which tell a robot or worker what kind of
battery, shock absorber or stereo system to install.
   Nissan said the new ``intelligent body assembly system'' at the
Zama plant was the first in the world to use computer-programmable
robots instead of fixed jigs in aligning the main body parts,
including floor, roof and side panels.
   That allows one assembly line to handle up to four different
models and eight body types at once. ``The positioning operations
for different models have been the most difficult aspects of body
assembly work to automate,'' a company statement said.
   Officials at Nissan said the system greatly reduces the time and
cost of model changes.
   Lengthy and expensive retooling of jigs and production machines
for model changes result in long ``down times'' for production
lines.
   With programmable robots, many changes can be made by modifying
the computer program. That can be combined with the design process.
   ``With this system, we can take the computer program to another
plant and begin production in three months,'' said Kazutake
Kobatake, a Nissan spokesman. ``Before, it took 10-11 months to
transfer production.''
   The system will cut retooling costs for a new model in half, he
said.
   Zama's No. 2 assembly line is one of the most highly automated
in Japan, with 97 percent of the 3,000-4,000 welds per car done by
robot, said Tsuneyuki Hane, general manager of the plant.
   Use of computerized production technology allows companies to
send a computer program, rather than bulky new jigs and equipment,
to an overseas plant to shift production to new or popular models.
   It also helps avoid excess inventory by tailoring each day's
production mix to demand.
   Such flexibility allows Nissan to produce several low-volume
specialty models for the Japanese market.
   The system, now used in Nissan's plants at Zama and Tochigi,
will be introduced at two other Japanese plants and the U.S.
factory in Smyrna, Tenn., company officials said.
   Other industries also are increasing the flexibility of
production lines.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., maker of Panasonic bicycles,
allows people to custom-order from 18 models and 199 paint jobs,
specifying size and choosing pedals, tires and logo.
   ``We're able to make a bicycle which fits the customer precisely
and deliver it within two weeks,'' a Matsushita official said.
   He said the custom-order system adds about $45-$95 to the cost
of a bicycle. It accounts for only about 15,000 of the 700,000
bicycles the company sells each year, but is growing and has spread
to other companies, the official said.
   Analysts say the United States trails in flexible assembly line
technology, and that large American companies have displayed less
interest in specialized low-volume production.

<HEAD>Little-Known American Writers Find a Home on British Stage</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It took a world premiere in Britain for playwright
Sally Nemeth to get some attention at home in New York. Now, she
says, agents answer her calls.
   London has always loved American dramatists, not just greats
such as Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill but the up-and-coming
too, as Nemeth has discovered.
   John Logan is virtually unheard of in the United States, except
in his home city, Chicago. But his 1983 play, ``Never the Sinner,''
is running on London's West End with an impressive cast headed by
Joss Ackland and Julian Glover.
   Richard Nelson's off-Broadway play, ``Some Americans Abroad,''
was first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company last summer.
The American dramatist's second commission for the British company
opens in Stratford-upon-Avon in the autumn.
   One reason American playwrights can make it in Britain is that
production costs are much lower here than in New York. Another is
that critical pressures are less acute. London fields an array of
equally influential reviewers. It isn't just a one-critic town such
as New York, where a nod from Frank Rich of The New York Times can
make or break a production.
   Some dramatists feel their work strikes more sympathetic chords
abroad.
   ``It's hard to go out on a stylistic limb in the States,
although I think that is changing,'' said Nemeth, 30, whose rather
parched, opaque writing style is at odds with much American drama.
Her new play, ``Mill Fire,'' about an explosion at an Alabama steel
mill, opened to mixed reviews March 16 at west London's Riverside
Studios.
   ``I think my plays are somewhat hard to read in that they're
very spare. It takes someone who can really read that kind of work
to respond to it,'' she said.
   Nemeth has found that someone in director Brian Stirner, the
Briton who staged her two London plays.
   Richard Nelson's oblique, ironic tone seems more attuned to
contemporary British writers than to his American peers.
   ``The reaction here has been much more generous, much more
understanding,'' said Nelson, 39, who has had two plays performed
by the RSC: ``Some Americans Abroad'' and ``Principia Scriptoriae.''
   Both got better reviews in London than in New York. ``Some
Americans Abroad'' received an Olivier Award nomination as the
year's best comedy. In London, says Nelson, his plays ``have been
critically perceived and understood and argued about.''
   Only recently has he hit problems. In mid-March he quit as book
writer of ``King,'' the troubled London musical about the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr.
   John Logan says his ``Never the Sinner'' shows an interest in
history less evident in American playwriting. In the American
theater, he charges, ``We have forgotten our history; we've
betrayed it.''
   He said he did not want to write the kind of personal play that
proliferates in the United States.
   ``I have very little regard for anemic TV theater _ for
naturalistic, self-indulgent, sometimes autobiographical drama,''
he said. Four of Logan's five favorite dramatists are British:
Steven Berkoff, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill and Harold Pinter.
   Another Chicago writer, Aaron Iverson, wrote a play in 1982 only
to find it being premiered, professionally, in London last month.
   ``I'd had readings of the play done (in Chicago) but no one
expressed a whole lot of interest,'' said Iverson, 32.
   Instead, his ``Side Pockets'' ended its month-long debut March 3
at the Theater Royal, Stratford East. Iverson has been commissioned
to write a second play for the theater.
   He said the playhouse, in a blue-collar, ethnically mixed area,
reached a public more difficult to attract in the United States.
There, he said, ``the audience I want only watches TV and movies.''
   Iverson, who earns his living as a lawyer, says: ``I kind of
feel like working-class or poor people aren't really addressed
much.''
   Nemeth has had many offers from American agents in the wake of
London productions of her two plays, but producers so far haven't
been forthcoming. Logan continues to work regularly in Chicago,
where he currently has a commission from the Goodman Theater, but
he has yet to have a major staging of any of his plays in New York.
   While none of the writers sees Broadway as a goal, few are ready
to renounce the United States altogether and move to London as
playwright Martin Sherman (``When She Danced,'' ``Bent'') did over
a decade ago.
   Said Nelson: ``I love my country. I'm American; I love living in
America.''

<HEAD>Battle Over the Military Budget, Cheney the `Budget Hawk'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was only a joke, but one with a message:
when Secretary of Defense Richard B. Cheney heard the Berlin Wall
had been torn down, he wanted it rebuilt.
   ``He said it was the only thing standing between us and the
Russians,'' Speaker of the House Thomas S. Foley kidded Cheney at a
formal dinner 10 days ago.
   Cheney is the administration's ranking budget hawk these days;
he's being needled and challenged on all fronts. He makes a
logical, tightly-reasoned case for a slow and cautious reduction in
defense spending, but the pressure is intense to cut more, faster.
The cutback case is made with matching logic, and with the
advantage of representing change in a time of dramatic world change.
   ``The minute Dick Cheney walked through the Pentagon door he
ordered all the clocks set back 10 years,'' joked Foley, a friend
and a House colleague before Cheney joined the Cabinet.
   ``No matter what you've heard, I'm not a relic of the Cold War.
. .,, Cheney joked back. ``But . . . . somebody in this town has to
worry about what we're going to do when Stalin dies.''
   There are serious numbers behind all that, beginning with the
$295 billion defense budget the administration seeks for the year
beginning next Oct. 1. That's more dollars than this year, but it
represents a 2.6 percent reduction in inflation-adjusted spending.
   Cheney recommends 2 percent cuts in each of the following four
budget years.
   Democratic leaders, and now two Republican members of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, say those reductions don't go deep
enough. Sens. William S. Cohen of Maine and John McCain of Arizona
said Thursday that the defense budget can be cut by twice as much
as the administration is proposing, to save at least $50 billion
more over the next five years.
   Foley said their proposal will not preempt Democratic demands
for sharper defense budget cuts. He said it shows the
administration does not have wide support for the spending levels
Cheney is advocating.
   ``The administration is really quite isolated in this,'' the
speaker said Friday.
   Cheney has been arguing his side of the case in congressional
testimony, speeches and Pentagon statements. He put it all together
in an address to the American Society of Newspaper Editors last
Wednesday, saying that the administration ``has moved
aggressively'' to change defense proposals so as to fit changing
times.
   ``But as secretary of defense, I have to focus on Soviet
capabilities,'' he said. ``Intentions can change overnight.
Capabilities take much longer to alter.''
   Cheney said those capabilities include the world's largest
standing army, and a strategic nuclear force even now being
modernized.
   So, he said, the administration is proceeding cautiously and
prudently, with a five-year defense plan that would cut spending by
some $231 billion, putting the defense share of the budget and the
gross national product at the lowest levels since before World War
II.
   Even in the best of international circumstances, Cheney said, if
the United States is to remain a leading world power, it must
maintain offensive and defensive strategic forces; a system of
military alliances; troops deployed abroad, fewer in number but
still there; naval superiority; flexible forces to react to varying
contingencies; and an industrial base to produce high-technology
weapons.
   Cheney said people who talk about cutting defense spending by
half over the next 10 years ``would give us the defense budget of a
second-class power _ the budget of an America in decline.
   ``Far from becoming less of a force in the world, America is
going to be taking on greater global responsibilities in the years
ahead,'' Cheney said. ``No other nation will be capable of our kind
of global reach.
   ``Security threats were not invented by the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, and threats will remain long after that party's
gone out of business,'' he said. ``As a result, the world will
still be a dangerous place, a place that will continue to benefit
from _ and indeed require _ the stabilizing influence of the
American military.''
   That, in brief, is the case advanced by the administration's
point man on the defense budget. The counter arguments are being
sounded in Congress. The battle over defense spending is just
beginning.

<HEAD>Valerie Bertinelli Plays Private Detective `Sydney' in New Comedy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS Elsewhere in Television item on ``Days of Our Lives'' to
CORRECT character's name from Bradley to Brady</NOTE>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Valerie Bertinelli spent five years looking
for a new television series until she was sold on becoming
``Sydney,'' a role she says emphasizes hidden elements of her own
personality.
   The new CBS comedy, in which she plays a young and single
private detective, is her first series since ``One Day at a Time.''
   Bertinelli literally grew up on ``One Day at a Time'' as one of
the daughters of Bonnie Franklin. She began when she was 15 and was
24 when the show ended in 1984.
   ``I was never allowed to go this far with Barbara Cooper on `One
Day at a Time,''' she says of her character on ``Sydney,'' which
airs Wednesdays. ``I couldn't yell at people and make it funny.
Sydney yells at everybody when she doesn't get her way. She puts
her foot down and says, `This is the way it's going to be.'
   ``I've been looking for a new series ever since the old one went
off,'' she said. ``I've been looking and looking. My manager and
partner, Jack Grossbart, and I must have gone through a hundred
ideas. Then Michael Wilson came along with `Sydney' and it clicked
for me. I want it to stay on a long time.''
   The show was created by Wilson, who also is a co-executive
producer.
   ``I'd heard so many ideas and they all sounded alike,''
Bertinelli said. ``I don't know if it was the idea or Michael
himself. I really, really liked him. I liked his energy and the way
his mind worked so fast. I knew I wanted to work with him.''
   Bertinelli plays Sydney Kells, the daughter of a policeman, now
dead, and sister of a rookie policeman played by Matthew Perry. She
does most of her detective work for a conservative lawyer played by
Craig Bierko, and drives him crazy. She hangs out at a neighborhood
bar run by Barney Martin, her father's old police partner. Rebeccah
Bush is her best friend, Perry Anzilotti is her snitch and Daniel
Baldwin is the barroom pest.
   ``I keep wanting to say Sydney is like part of me,'' she said.
``But it all goes back to Michael. It's like the part of me I've
never allowed anyone to see. She's gregarious. She's smart,
intuitive and naive in a way. Let's say she's naively jaded.''
   The stories involve both her cases and her personal life.
Sometimes, they're mixed. In one episode, her best friend is
kidnapped and she has to find her.
   The show got good reviews, but is doing only so-so in the
ratings and will have to improve to run beyond its first 13
episodes. It faces two popular Wednesday shows, ABC's ``Head of the
Class'' and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries.'' CBS hopes to boost the
ratings with a special appearance by Pat Harrington, Bertinelli's
co-star on ``One Day at a Time.'' The episode, in which Harrington
also plays a private eye, will be broadcast as a special on Monday,
April 23, in the time slot now occupied by ``City.''
   The show's theme music is ``Finish What Ya Started,'' from the
latest album by Bertinelli's husband, rock guitarist Eddie Van
Halen, a member of the group Van Halen.
   ``I begged Ed to let me use it,'' she said.
   The first part of the name of her production company, OOMP &amp;
Friends, ``is a little personal thing between Ed and me,''
Bertinelli said. ``Let people try to figure it out,'' she added.
   After ``One Day at a Time,'' Bertinelli starred in the
miniseries ``I'll Take Manhattan'' and 11 TV movies.
   She last was seen in October in the movie ``Taken Away,'' in
which she played a single mother falsely accused of child abuse.
Before that, she was a pioneer aviatrix in ``Pancho Barnes.''

<HEAD>A Market of Individual Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An old maxim, that it is stocks rather than the
stock market that should matter to individual investors, is getting
a workout on Wall Street these days. It is written in the averages.
   In the year's first quarter, the Dow Jones industrial average,
made up of very large and mostly very blue-chip companies, slipped
only 50 points or so, which works out to a drop of 1.7 percent.
   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock average, which includes a good
many relatively smaller companies, fell more sharply, about 3.8
percent, or more than double the descent rate of the DJ average.
   The even broader Value Line Composite Index, whose 1,700 members
include an even bigger mix of smaller companies, fell 5.8 percent,
leaving it about 15 percent lower than in the summer of 1987.
   The verdict: Many stocks, especially smaller stocks, are down a
great deal more than is indicated by the DJ average, without
question the most widely used numerical indicator of market
strength.
   Smaller stocks have been hit hard for several years now. Wright
Investors' Service points out that in 23 of the past 27 quarters,
small stocks have lagged behind the bigger, brand-name companies
that dominate most indicators.
   It is a rare situation, and one that tends to confuse a lot of
people, and even some analysts.
   Has the stock market, for example, already had its correction,
disquised from popular view by a rather slight decline in the DJ
average? Is the correction yet to come? Is the direction of the
market up or down?
   The confusion might be greatest, of course, for those who judge
the market by the averages instead of the prices of individual
stocks or groups of stocks, because the current market is an
unusual mix.
   Utility stocks, which had risen sharply late in 1989, were big
losers in the first quarter of this year, falling 6.8 percent.
Financial stocks fell more than 7 percent in both the final quarter
of 1989 and the first of 1990.
   In fact, only four of 25 industry groups advanced in the first
quarter, and three of them _ construction, metal production and
electronics _ showed gains not so much because of strength but
because they had fallen earlier.
   Such figures drive home the point made by so many investment
advisers, that popular averages hardly tell the full story or even
a realistic one, that people invest in individual stocks rather
than in the market, and that they must watch stock prices rather
than stock market averages.
   Today's stock market also recalls a kernel of advice underlying
a good many conservative investment philosophies, that within any
industry, even those performing poorly, you may find companies that
defy the generality.
   The lesson, it seems, is that the forest isn't just a mass of
trees but an assembly of individual trees. And the stock market
isn't a unit in itself but one made up of thousands of separate
companies, each distinct in its own way.

<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Switzerland, usually a tranquil haven
in a troubled world, is in an uproar over disclosures that the
government spied on its own citizens for decades.
   Paul C. Schaffroth, retired managing editor of the liberal
newspaper Der Bund, was among hundreds of thousands who demanded a
summary of his file.
   Federal police gave him a clean political bill of health, but
their dossier on him went back 20 years.
   It noted, among other things, that the Chinese Embassy once
invited him to watch a movie about pandas, he took part in a press
trip to China and, as a city councilor in charge of police, once
received a letter on the visit of a Soviet delegation.
   The federal police files on Schaffroth and more than half a
million other Swiss and foreign nationals were secret until a
parliamentary commission disclosed their existence in November.
   Another file was kept on Justice Minister Arnold Koller, who is
in charge of the police and also serves currently as president of
this nation of 6.5 million.
   Switzerland, one of the world's oldest democracies, celebrates
its 700th anniversary next year. What Koller describes as a ``deep
crisis of confidence'' threatens to overshadow the event.
   More than 300,000 people have asked the federal prosecutor's
office for copies of file cards summarizing dossiers the police may
have on them. Just answering the letters will take at least until
the end of 1990.
   The government also is under pressure to release the full
dossiers on which the file cards are based. Officials say that
would take many more months.
   Fewer than 30,000 people have received information to date.
   Published excerpts of Schaffroth's and other files indicate
surveillance focused on contacts with leftist circles and travels
to Communist countries, but was not limited to them.
   Even a taste for beer or watching street theater was recorded. A
car parked near an anti-nuclear rally could inspire an entry in the
owner's dossier.
   ``These methods are unworthy of our democracy,'' Schaffroth, 69,
told The Associated Press. ``I feel angry and concerned.''
   Koller characterized the methods as ``unacceptable and
amateurish,'' but said the surveillance began during the Cold War
and was similar to that in other countries.
   ``Snooping state'' has become a widely used reference in the
Swiss press, but the strongest reactions have come from regular
critics of the establishment.
   Artists and writers have said they may refuse to help prepare
for next year's celebrations. There have been calls for a boycott
of a national census planned in December.
   ``What made us deserve a state which is so unsure of itself that
its concern for security becomes paranoid?'' Adolf Muschg, a
well-known novelist, asked at a protest rally last month in Bern.
   He said the federal police had turned Switzerland ``into a
banana republic.''
   Disclosures of other secret files in the Justice and Defense
ministries have added to the clamor. they include lists of
``suspects'' to be interned or restricted in case of war or
political emergency.
   Particularly startling was the discovery in the Justice Ministry
of data on thousands of foreign children who vacationed in
Switzerland in the early years after World War II under a Red Cross
charity program.
   Hubert Bucher, secretary-general of the Swiss Red Cross, said
the records were turned over to the government for lack of space.
He denied suggestions that the Red Cross offered them for possible
use by Swiss counterintelligence.
   ``A storm of mistrust is sweeping the country,'' Defense
Minister Kaspar Villiger told a congress of his conservative
Radical Democratic Party last month.
   An editorial in the influential conservative newspaper Neue
Zuercher Zeitung spoke of the ``brutal disillusionment'' of
citizens.
   The independent Basler Zeitung said the files ``reflect the
reverse side of our national character: This proverbial tidiness,
this efficiency, this zeal, once unleashed ... can turn into
unscrupulous fulfillment of duty which evidently may eliminate
intelligence as well as conscience.''
   Since January, the scandal has been the main topic in newspaper
letters columns. Many recent letters have defended surveillance,
particularly as a means of controlling crime.
   Some writers adopt a mocking tone.
   One suggested all citizens keep files on themselves and send
them to the authorities regularly. Another proposed that all
dossiers be burned in a huge anniversary bonfire next year.
   Villiger, the defense minister, said at his party rally: ``One
of the worst things that can happen to a state is exposing itself
to ridicule.''

<HEAD>Ivory Trade Ban Weakened, Threatening Survival Of African
Elephants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A landmark agreement banning world ivory trade
has begun to crumble, posing a renewed threat to the survival of
the African elephant, conservationists say.
   The opposition of several African nations had been expected, but
the bombshell came in January when Great Britain pulled out of the
accord.
   ``It was a shock to all conservationists,'' says Ginette Hemley,
director of the U.S. office of TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade
monitoring program of the World Wildlife Fund. ``It was a massive
turnaround on the part of the United Kingdom.''
   Britain had argued forcibly in favor of the ban last fall.
   ``It came down to a fight between the British foreign minister
and the environment minister,'' Hemley says. The foreign minister
recommended that Britain pull out to ensure confidence in the Hong
Kong economy, she says.
   ``The problem with that is it will keep open ivory markets that
otherwise would have shut down,'' says David Western, an ecologist
in Nairobi with Wildlife Conservation International. ``And it sends
out a signal to certain poachers in Africa that Hong Kong is still
good as a market. And it therefore stimulates poaching once again
in Africa.''
   Nevertheless, the ivory trade ban, coupled with decisions by the
United States, Europe and Japan to ban all ivory imports, seems to
have temporarily slowed the slaughter of African elephants, Hemley
says.
   ``Right now, we're in a bit of a holding pattern,'' she says.
``While poaching is going on, we have every reason to believe it's
slowed down dramatically. The closing of the U.S. and the European
markets had a major, major effect on the trade and, hopefully, on
poaching in the field.''
   A study is under way to determine the ban's precise effect on
poaching, she says.
   ``Compared with this time last year, the poaching levels are
down in Kenya, down in Tanzania, and down in Zaire _ way down,''
says Western. ``So viewed overall, the picture looks more
promising.''
   The price of luxury ivory products has dropped by 70 percent in
the United States as demand has fallen, says Hemley. In Kenya, the
price paid to poachers has dropped from $20 to $50 per kilogram
(2.2 pounds) to $2 to $5 per kilogram, Hemley says. The average
weight of a tusk in trade is 2 to 4 kilograms.
   The population of African elephants has declined from 1.3
million in 1979 to an estimated 625,000, according to a report
published in October by the Ivory Trade Review Group, an
international team of biologists and environmentalists.
   Highly organized poachers armed with automatic weapons roam
freely across African borders, killing 10 percent of the remaining
elephants each year, the report estimated.
   At that rate, elephants will be extinct in the wild within 30
years, says Western, one of the report's authors.
   The report was prepared in advance of a meeting last October in
Lausanne, Switzerland, of the international agency that regulates
ivory trade.
   At that meeting, the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, delegates from more
than 100 nations voted to ban trade in ivory around the world _ but
with a last-minute compromise that threatened to undo the agreement.
   Countries were given 90 days to lodge ``reservations'' about
their participation in the trade ban. Delegates also agreed to
commission a special review of the ivory trade before the next
CITES meeting in 1992, where the ban conceivably could be
overturned, although that is not considered likely.
   Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa, Malawi and Botswana filed
reservations, arguing that they are able to manage their herds well
enough to cull ivory without depleting their elephant populations.
   China also filed a reservation, raising fears that a new market
could develop there. But Western discounts that possibility.
   ``China is in no position to buy up lots of ivory, because it
doesn't have the hard currency,'' he says.
   Ivory carvers from Hong Kong reportedly also have begun moving
to South Korea, which is not part of CITES, but the effect of that
move also is uncertain.
   South Korea ``doesn't have the tradition of using ivory for
trinkets and bangles, and that market doesn't build up overnight,''
says Western.
   Hemley notes that South Korea's role in wildlife trade has
increased dramatically during the last few years.
   ``It is a booming economy and potentially the biggest new market
for luxury ivory products,'' she says.
   Western, who expressed concern last fall that an ironclad ivory
ban hadn't been enacted, is now more sanguine about the African
elephant's future.
   ``The most important consumer countries _ Japan, Europe and
America _ will stick with the ban,'' he says. ``Over 80 percent of
the total demand is in those three countries.''
   Hong Kong, where most of the world's ivory carvers are located,
has a supply of 670 tons of ivory on hand, reports indicate, and
may be stuck with it.
   ``The Hong Kong traders are not going to have a very easy time
unloading that consignment,'' Western says. ``The shift in public
opinion has been so great that ivory will not be a commodity you
can wear any more. Elephants will be under much, much less pressure
in the next few ye`It's sort of touch-and-go,'' says Hemley. ``The fight
is by no
means over.''

   James Addison Baker III, secretary of state, has
been one of the most powerful men in Washington since Ronald Reagan
first moved into the White House. And one of the most paradoxical,
like his current boss and pal, George Bush. Above all, the nation's
top diplomat is an adroit politician.

   He swills beer right out of the can at
black-tie banquets, and spits horrid little gobs of tobacco juice
upon the acutely manicured greens of choice country clubs. He's a
charmer, this Jim Baker.
   He has charmed the president and the Congress of the United
States, and the president and the Congress of People's Deputies of
the Soviet Union. Nancy Reagan, no slouch for loyalty, adored him
despite his prior command of two campaigns against her husband.
   He was the hit, rather than boss George Bush, of the National
Prayer Breakfast a few weeks back, and his raunchy stories are
rollicking triumphs with fellows in the locker room. Michael
Dukakis' campaign manager was dazzled by him. Media misanthropes
gush over him.
   Not bad for a man who, as secretary of state, has claimed little
global vision, who reads few books, and has, for the longest
intervals, had so little to say to so many eager to hear him say so
much. Ask Mikhail Gorbachev. Or Eduard Shevardnadze. Or the
tentative leadership of a tentatively free Lithuania. Or the
Chinese students.
   Jim Baker, 59, does not hesitate to hesitate. Nor, when he
likes, even to jump ship.
   He is the most paradoxical member of the president's team, save
the president himself. And they are like twins, fellow Houstonians,
except Bush is the highbred Easterner turned Texan and Baker the
highbred Texan schooled in the East. Both tall, taut and athletic
Ivy Leaguers, at home in tennis whites and golf pastels, but with a
yen for sagebrush and bluejeans. For shooting quail and ducks and
turkeys and wade-fishing in the bayous. For sharing thoughts, just
one to the other.
   For months, James Addison Baker III was as mute as the statues
in the Kremlin's Catherine Hall about the gusts of change in the
Soviet empire. Some, including Gorbachev, leaders of the NATO
allies and of the U.S. Congress, were dismayed that the secretary
of state seemed almost spooked by the opportunities inherent in the
Cold War thaw.
   While Gorbachev toured the world with a song of conciliation and
unfolded one new arms-control initiative after another, Baker and
his Texas friend, Bush, demurred to the outcome of a ``strategic
review'' of Ronald Reagan's rush to detente with Moscow.
   No one need have been surprised at the tactics of the new team.
Jim Baker, as architect of Bush's less-than-meteoric rise to the
presidency and now as vicar of his foreign policy, is given even
less to risk than Bush. Together, they have made ``caution'' and
``prudence'' the watchwords of this administration.
   Which is not to say that either suffers diplomatic lockjaw, nor,
for that matter, that there haven't been some embarrassing slips.
But as Baker himself explains it, ``Sometimes a pro-active policy
is best advanced by doing nothing until the right time.''
   And after that agonizingly dilatory start, the president and
Baker have moved from tentative probing to vigorous advocacy of a
friendlier East-West relationship. A so-called ``no agenda''
shipboard summit off Malta in December led Bush to advance 21
specific proposals for greater comity between the superpowers. Stay
tuned. Bush-Gorbachev II is coming to Washington on May 30.
   To Jim Baker, timing is everything. Any politician knows that.
Any lawyer knows that. He is both, even if he doesn't care to admit
it. Years ago, in his sole, unsuccessful stab at elective office,
he campaigned on the slogan, ``Texas needs a lawyer, not a
politician, for attorney general.'' And he was once overheard
snapping at an aide: ``I'm a lawyer. Not a politician. And don't
ever forget it.''
   Don't believe it, either. Fact is, Baker, who once regarded
election days as a chance to go hunting, ranks as one of the most
politically oriented secretaries of state in history. From the
moment he settled into his small back office, behind the huge
ceremonial one, he let it be known that he was ``George Bush's
representative at the State Department and not the State
Department's representative at the White House.''
   At times, Baker acts as if he were still running Bush's 1988
campaign. Last September, he was challenged to respond to the
complaint of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, that
the administration was dragging its feet on superpower issues.
Baker, rather than addressing that charge, replied: ``When the
president is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on his
handling of foreign policy, if I were the leader of the opposition,
I might have something similar to say.''
   Baker's poll-watching galls the Foreign Service's idealists, who
argue that in a rapidly changing world, the boldest vision can be
the most realistic, the most aggressive policy the most prudent.
   Baker, first as Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, then as treasury
secretary, and now as secretary of state, has been a master at
working Congress, and he insists that his lieutenants emulate his
meticulous courtesy when dealing with the legislative branch. He
typically works until 9 p.m. or so, with most of those evening
hours occupied with initiating or returning calls to Capitol Hill
on his 41-line telephone.
   And it is through Congress that he sometimes exercises his
power. After weeks of Israeli foot-dragging on his proposal for a
negotiated settlement of the Palestinian issue, he induced Sen. Bob
Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, to suggest taking aid from
Israel and Egypt and giving it to Eastern Europe. Baker then
publicly smiled upon Dole's trial balloon, while insisting the idea
had no connection with the Palestinian dispute.
   At Cabinet meetings, Baker occupies the traditional seat of
honor, at the president's right. Rightly so. No man or woman enjoys
more presidential confidence. And none can so comfortably tell him
that he is dead wrong about something. ``There are others who
can,'' Bush once said. ``But they don't.''

   Without Jim Baker, George Bush might not have become president.
Because without Baker, Bush would not have been vice president, and
Ronald Reagan's anointed successor.
   It was in May, 1980, when Baker looked at Reagan's delegate
numbers and leaked it to the press that his candidate, Bush, would
be withdrawing from the presidential race. That was news to Bush,
who, several hundred miles away at the time, fully intended to
press Reagan in the windup primaries in New Jersey, Ohio and
California _ Reagan's home state.
   A furious Bush summoned Baker and his staff to his home in
Houston. As Bush tells the story in his book, ``Looking Forward,''
he insisted to Baker that he still had a shot.
   Baker: ``George, you've got to know when to hold 'em and know
when to fold 'em.''
   Bush: ``Jim, I've never quit anything until it was finished.''
   Baker: ``But the campaign IS finished, George. You're the only
one who doesn't seem to know it.''
   Bush withdrew, and Reagan got a unified convention in Detroit.
``What I'll admit to, but George never will,'' Baker said in 1981,
``is that the veep thing was always the fallback. It was always in
my mind. That's why, at every opportunity, I had him cool his
rhetoric about Reagan.'' And Reagan, he added, would have been
``terminally ticked off'' had Bush pursued him into California.
   It wasn't the vice president-elect who landed him his job in the
Reagan White House, a fact Baker is quick to confide to anyone who
suggests that he remains especially beholden to Bush. Instead, it
was Reagan's longtime California confidant, Michael K. Deaver, and
Nancy Reagan who sold the new president on making Baker the White
House chief of staff. Reagan loyalists initially were aghast, but
later viewed the appointment as a key to Reagan's first-term
success.
   Baker did have enemies in the Reagan administration, and he
wasn't entirely successful at cutting them down. He often found
himself at odds with then-counselor Edwin Meese and Defense
Secretary Caspar Weinberger, and particularly with National
Security Adviser William Clark and Secretary of State Alexander
Haig. The latter two were not at all pleased with his resistance to
their efforts to expand U.S. military involvement in Central
America.
   ``Jim saw himself as guardian of the president's legislative
agenda and was convinced that if we got too far into this, it could
jeopardize our ability to get anything through Congress,'' Deaver
recalled.
   In 1983, Clark left to become interior secretary, and Baker
pressed Reagan to make him his national security adviser, with
Deaver taking the chief of staff job. Reagan agreed, but then found
himself confronted in the Oval Office by the quartet of Meese, CIA
director William Casey, Weinberger and Clark, all of whom opposed
the appointment. Baker told the president to kill the plan if it
were a problem for him. Reagan did.
   Baker, wearied by the White House infighting, jumped at Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan's offer to swap jobs after the 1984
election. Reagan did agree to that one, and Baker took his one-man
think tank, his protege Richard G. Darman, with him.
   At Treasury, Baker built a record which ranks him beside Henry
H. Fowler and John B. Connally as the most influential occupants of
that job since World War II.
   In his 3{ years there, with Darman brainstorming behind the
scenes, he negotiated major international agreements for economic
coordination among industrialized nations, for dealing with Third
World debt, and for an orderly decline in the dollar _ thus
boosting U.S. exports. He was credited, too, with the single-handed
rescue of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement when those talks
were on the brink of collapse. Most notably, he pushed through a
major tax reform, in part by conceding credit and a prominent role
to congressional Democrats.
   None of those steps has yet drawn consensus raves from
economists or historians. The budget and trade deficits have barely
been dented, and the problem of Third World defaults won't go away.
But without his initiatives, says Baker, ``matters would have been
a great deal worse.''
   Baker's reputation for honesty was tainted when, by his own
admission, he told an unnecessary falsehood on national television
last year to conceal the first trip of presidential envoys to
Beijing following the Tiananmen Square massacre. In retrospect,
said Baker, he should have ``no-commented.''
   He was less than adroit, too, when he ad-libbed an expression of
confidence about Germany's ``continued membership in _ or
association with _ NATO,'' as if to open Germany's way out of the
alliance and toward neutrality. He disavowed the ``association
with'' phrase, but the slip served to weaken the U.S. position in
the eyes of other diplomats.
   Though generally familiar with global issues from his years with
Reagan, Baker came to his new job with huge gaps in his knowledge
of the international players and the nuances of diplomacy. He was
upstaged during some of his early encounters, like that first trip
to Moscow, where Gorbachev caught him off balance with an
announcement of Soviet troop cutbacks in Europe. But after more
than 300 meetings with foreign leaders and 150,000 miles of travel,
Baker is much more self-assured.
   Twenty-one years ago, Baker was a corporate attorney in Houston,
nominally a Democrat, who didn't bother to vote in most elections
and ``really didn't participate in partisan politics in any way.''

   Not so for Baker's wife and college sweetheart, Mary Stuart
McHenry, who had grown up in Dayton, Ohio, across the street from a
relative of Bush's. When Bush ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in
1964, she donned a straw boater and passed out leaflets. Some years
earlier, she once had attempted to organize a Republican precinct
meeting in her living room. ``One person came,'' Baker recalls. ``I
served the drinks.''
   Other than that, Baker remained on the political sidelines,
though Bush, who won a House seat two years later, became a
frequent hunting and fishing companion as well as tennis partner.
And they regularly attended services together at St. Martin's
Episcopal Church.
   Then, in 1969, as Bush was preparing for a second stab at the
Senate, Baker's world collapsed. Mary Stuart was dying of cancer.
Bush accompanied his distraught buddy on the hospital visits, then
to the funeral. Convinced that he needed a new challenge to salve
the grief, Bush implored Baker to manage his campaign in Harris
County _ Houston and the surrounding area. Finally, Baker accepted.
   Bush lost again, but Baker was hooked. In 1972 he served as
state GOP finance chairman, and ran the 14 Texas Gulf Coast
counties for Richard M. Nixon. And in 1975, Bush, by then Nixon's
special envoy to China, recommended him to Commerce Secretary
Rogers C.B. Morton as an undersecretary. Just eight months later,
he was recruited to follow Morton into President Ford's campaign,
which faced a stiff and burgeoning challenge from Ronald Reagan for
the GOP nomination. Morton made Baker the chief ``delegate hunter''
to track and woo uncommitted delegates and to keep Ford's own
convention force in line against Reagan's surging bandwagon. He
proved so effective that Ford replaced Morton with Baker for the
general election campaign. Ford came from 30 points down to lose a
squeaker to Jimmy Carter.
   In 1978, Baker made his only attempt to win elective office
himself, as Texas attorney general. He thought his opponent would
be liberal Price Daniel, but he found himself facing Mark White, a
more conservative and far more popular Democrat. Baker lost.
   There have been other setbacks.
   Baker's remarriage to Susan Garrett Winston, his first wife's
closest friend and the widow of a Baker acquaintance, triggered
resentments among the seven children by their previous spouses. But
those family problems have now been patched up.
   Jim and Susan have had one child together, Mary Bonner, 12. The
other seven are grown.
   What Jim Baker wants most to do, according to some intimates, is
get the job now held by friend George.
   Baker ``categorically'' denies this, saying he intends to be
secretary of state for eight years, then drive himself and Susan to
his ranch in Wyoming.
   But a Princeton friend, Phil Uzielli, remembers that during the
Bush campaign ``a group of us were sitting around and someone said
again that Jimmy is the one who should be president, not George. He
loved it, and he let the talk go on a bit before shutting it down.''
   Susan Baker acknowledges that ``Jimmy has a tremendous ambition
and drive to reach the top. But the presidency is the last thing in
his mind right now ... he's got to be the best secretary of state
he can. The rest may come later.''
   ``Obviously, being president is on his mind,'' says former
Democratic National Chairman Robert Strauss. ``He's that smart and
that shrewd and that ambitious. He knows there's only one job in
Washington worth having.''

   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Jim Baker is the scion of one of
Houston's most distinguished families _ the Bakers of Baker &amp;
Botts, one of the largest and oldest law firms west of the
Mississippi.
   His button-down shirts say ``JAB III,'' but he is actually the
fourth James A. Baker.
   The first, his great-grandfather, was a Civil War veteran and
district judge who moved to Houston and co-founded the firm after
the war. His grandfather, known as Captain Baker, a title bestowed
by the ceremonial Houston Light Guard, was a founder and chairman
of the Texas Commerce Bank, and, most dramatically, unraveled the
murder of his client, New York industrialist William March Rice, in
the fall of 1900. Captain Baker proved that Rice had been done in
by a butler and lawyer who had prepared a false will; his sleuthing
saved the fortune with which Rice University was built.
   Jim Baker's father, the third senior partner in Baker &amp; Botts,
was called ``The Warden'' by Jim's friends. He was a stern
disciplinarian, quick to administer whippings and urge Jim and
sister Bonnie to new challenges _ like jumping off the high dive no
matter how scared they were. Baker recalls his father often
awakened him by throwing ice water into his face. ``Gets you up
real fast,'' he said.
   Following his father, Baker attended the Hill School and
Princeton. He did a two-year stint in the Marines, commissioned as
a lieutenant. The Korean War was on, but he spent most of his time
on a ship in the Mediterranean. Then he went home to Texas for law
school, where he made the Law Review and missed by one slot the
``Order of the Coif,'' accorded the 10 percent of the graduating
class. He remains disappointed about that minor failure, even
dwells on it, to this day.
   Baker, barred from joining his father's firm by a
since-abandoned anti-nepotism rule, made his own mark as a
corporate attorney, amassing assets now estimated at $4 million.
   He was little known outside legal circles and the Houston
Country Club, where he and a fellow member won the tennis doubles
championship twice in the early 1960s. But Baker, a Democrat by
family tradition, and George Bush, a local oilman and son of a
Connecticut Republican senator, kept politics out of their game.

   No one in the Ronald Reagan administration,
with the possible exception of Secretary of State George Shultz,
achieved the stature that Jim Baker did.
   As White House chief of staff, he cultivated members of Congress
from the start, and rolled up legislative victories that eluded
other couriers of the Reagan program. He also assiduously courted
the news media, provoking Donald Regan, his successor as chief of
staff, to tell a Republican group that he was ``appalled'' at the
amount of time Baker spent with reporters, and then-CIA Director
William Casey to complain that Baker was the biggest leaker in town.
   But his supporters credited Baker with pushing the essential
elements of Reagan's first-term agenda through Congress, including
those surprisingly early triumphs on the budget and taxes _
fashioned by luring ``Boll Weevil'' Democrats into a new Hill
majority.
   Some critics fault him for just those successes _ saying he too
often orchestrated short-term victories without much caring about
the lasting consequences, a burgeoning federal deficit foremost
among them.
   He was ``much more of a Mr. Fix-it'' than planner, ``much more
interested in politics than in policy,'' said former Reagan
Treasury official John E. Chapoton, a one-time law partner and
neighbor of Baker's.
   William A. Niskanen Jr., a former member of the Council of
Economic Advisers, said, ``He doesn't bring any particular
convictions to bear on a job ... other than doing a good job. I
don't think he has any particular vision.''
   David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget
during Baker's tenure at the White House, wrote that ``Baker was,
deep down, neither very versed on matters of policy nor intensely
interested in them.''
   Baker, at the time, admitted as much. ``I don't consider myself
as one who has deeply held views on specific issues,'' he told
Washingtonian magazine in 1982.
   Baker might have found himself the odd man out among Reagan's
coterie of Californians around the Oval Office, but, under a plan
drawn up by his prickly but creative sidekick, Richard G. Darman,
he quickly managed to seize control of the White House paper flow
to the president.
   With that came power, particularly the ability to ``knife his
enemies and praise his own work,'' according to an undelighted but
impressed Paul M. Weyrich, president of the super-conservative Free
Congress Research and Education Foundation.

   Power, says Secretary of State Jim Baker, must
be put in perspective.
   ``Power doesn't really bring the fulfillment that many think it
does,'' Baker told a National Prayer Breakfast in February as
President Bush and 3,000 other government employees listened.
   ``Over these last nine years,'' Baker said, ``I have had
opportunities to participate in the exercise of more power than I
would even have imagined. I have felt the weight of responsibility
that that brings, and I have to admit to you as well that I have
felt the temptations that are attendant to it.''
   But that changed, he said, when he came up against a ``personal
problem'' several years ago. He didn't say what it was. Perhaps he
referred to the tribulations with his son John, who was arrested in
1982, fined $2,000 and required to enter a drug treatment program
for selling marijuana.
   His wife, Susan, Baker said, helped him pray and to recognize
that ``I really needed to stop trying to play God, and turn the
matter over to him ... Without this kind of partnership, I'm
convinced I would never have resolved the problem.''
   Baker also described another moment that drove home, in his
mind, the fleeting nature of power. He was riding to the White
House in his limousine, he said, when he noticed a familiar figure,
walking alone, on the sidewalk.
   ``He was someone many of you would have recognized, a chief of
staff in a previous administration,'' Baker said. ``There he was,
alone, no reporters, no security, no adoring public, no trappings
of power _ just one solitary man alone with his thoughts.
   ``That mental picture continually serves to remind me of the
impermanence of power and place. That man had it all, but only for
a time. That memory puts my own life in perspective.''

   ``If a lot of people cling to General de Gaulle's image and say
they have something Gaullist about them, it shows that his politics
and ideas were very realistic,'' he says.
   De Gaulle had a large family, but he left no dynasty behind him.
His son, Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, is a senator. Two grandsons
are members of the National Assembly. Laurent is not sure about
running for office.
   The general's shoes, all agree, are not easy to fill.
   Charles Andre Marie Joseph de Gaulle was born into a family
going back five centuries into what was known as the sword-bearing
officer class.
   France at the time, in its Belle Epoch, had produced Monet,
Degas, Cezanne, Gauguin, Matisse, Toulouse-Lautrec and Renoir.
Rodin was sculpting, Proust was dreaming, and Rostand had written
``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   De Gaulle's father, a teacher, kindled an interest in history
and geography, but young Charles knew his role. Biographers
recounted how, in a game of toy soldiers, his brother wanted to be
king of France.
   ``Never!'' Charles blurted out. ``France is mine!''
   When France was his, he treated it with respect. Shunning the
trappings of power, he remained an acting brigadier general even
when called back from retirement in 1958 to end the Algerian War.
   Despite his postwar popularity, he could not consolidate the
turbulent politics. Wondering aloud how Joan of Arc would have
looked atop a coalition, he retreated in 1946 to his beloved woods.
   His only home was the modest Boisserie in Colombey, a former
brewery bought in 1934 with a small down-payment from his colonel's
pay. He lived simply, amusing himself with long lone walks.
   During the bitter war over Algeria, maverick officers attempting
a coup d'etat were such a threat that de Gaulle got back on the
radio for another appeal: ``Frenchmen! Frenchwomen. Help me!''
   Later, die-hard terrorists sprayed gunfire at his armored
Citroen, among four other attempts on his life. But, for security,
de Gaulle relied mostly on his aloof and forbidding presence.
   His political undoing came about on the streets of Paris in
1968. Rioting students, rebelling at a stagnating France under a
leader from another age, set politics to boil.
   De Gaulle held a referendum, his old device to challenge France
to find a better way. The vote showed he had lost the nation's
confidence. He left the presidency and, a year later, he died.
   He is buried in a modest tomb at the little church in Colombey.
Not far away, a 150-foot-tall granite-and-bronze Cross of Lorraine
is visible for miles around.
   One of the two fragments of Gaullist philosophy chipped in the
stone asserts: ``There exists a pact over 20 centuries between the
greatness of France and freedom in the world.''
   But Genevieve Anthonioz de Gaulle, a favorite niece, prefers the
second, which she feels sums up her uncle's long, spare life: ``In
our time, the only dispute of value is man's. It is man who must be
saved, allowed to live and to develop.''
   Each year, 120,000 Frenchmen and foreigners come here, out of
respect or simple curiosity. During 1990, memories will be closer
at hand.
   Jacques Chirac, the mayor of Paris who ran for president for the
neo-Gaullist RPR, in March opened a display of photos, documents
and memorabilia. The piece de resistance is a wax General de
Gaulle, eerily lifelike.
   The post office issued a commemorative stamp, prompting the
satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, to draw its own version with
a protruding annex to accommodate de Gaulle's ample nose.
   From Nov. 19-24, the Charles de Gaulle Institute and the U.N.
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization are sponsoring a
seminar entitled, ``De Gaulle in His Century.''
   Since 1986, the Institute has commissioned 500 studies from
specialists in 50 countries to add to existing Gaulliana. Its own
22 books include a bibliography of thousands of works.
   It is hard to escape ubiquitous photos of the general's deadpan
mien, his prominent nose brooding over a resolute and clean-shaven
chin.
   But in a France that is melding slowly with a wider Europe, a
less assertive France where the term ``grandeur'' provokes the
occasional snicker, some Frenchmen see memories slipping away.
   On a sunny Saturday, a family from a village in northern France
stood solemnly by de Gaulle's grave. Another visitor asked them
what they knew of the man buried there.
   Lysiane Nourte, 17, and her 18-year-old sister, Anne-Lise,
looked at each other and shrugged. Finally, Lysiane ventured,
``Wasn't he the chief of the war?''
   Their father tried to tell them a little about de Gaulle and, to
the reporter, he explained that the general was a sort of cartoon
character to a new generation. As he spoke, 10-year-old Yann had a
flash: ``Didn't he have a beard?''
   Still, throngs pack into his old lair, with its lavishly signed
photos of the century's other great leaders and a library that
sandwiched Karl von Clausewitz between Balzac and Moliere.
   ``Some people come back year after year, to stand quietly and
reflect,'' says Marinette Piot, a Colombey native who runs a
postcard and kitsch shop near the church. ``He is not forgotten.''

   Back in the '70s there was talk of a
back-to-the-city movement. In places like Detroit, that was mostly
talk. Today Detroit faces an uncertain future with tens of
thousands of derelict homes and businesses simply abandoned by
their owners. But the city is trying to fight back.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 300 years after its founding as a French
colony, Detroit is looking for new settlers willing to stake claims
to a city losing ground every month to blight and desertion.
   Thousands of abandoned houses are being demolished in a
multimillion-dollar effort to prevent arson and drugs from
spreading throughout neighborhoods still trying to hold their own.
   In addition, low-interest loans are being offered to renovate
derelict homes.
   After 40 years of white flight to the suburbs, Detroit _ like
many other cities _ has become a tattered patchwork of new downtown
high-rises, aging public housing, modest subdivisions, squalid
tenements and ever-broader stretches of vacant land.
   Despite scattered private and public renovation efforts, the
city has become the reluctant landlord of 20 percent of its total
land area as buildings and vacant lots revert to city control
because of unpaid taxes.
   Unofficial estimates say there are 80,000 parcels of vacant land
within the city. Between 50,000 and 60,000 of those are owned by
the city, which has no overall strategy for developing them.
   The Detroit Free Press in July 1989 counted more than 15,000
abandoned buildings in Detroit, two-thirds of them vacant
single-family homes.
   Gary Sands, a professor of urban geography at Wayne State
University, blames the city's economic, social and image problems.
   The city lost 100,000 jobs between 1980 and 1988, when its
population fell from 1.2 million to about 1 million. The 1990
census is expected to show a drop below 1 million.
   ``A lot of the problem with the vacant derelict land is that
there is no market for it,'' Sands says. ``There's no demand.''
   Detroit's closest suburbs attracted increasing numbers of
relatively affluent, better-educated blacks during the 1980s, while
predominantly white suburban sprawl stretched even farther.
   Sands says the city must find a way to lure a generation native
to the suburbs and which, except for downtown entertainment, avoids
Detroit.
   ``People want bright, shiny stuff; they're not interested in
pioneering,'' he says. ``Detroit has never had the real
high-density office core, like New York, that makes people want to
live close to where they work. There's more commuting from suburb
to suburb than from suburb to central city.''
   Robert Berg, Mayor Coleman Young's press secretary, puts part of
the blame on negative news reports.
   ``We get tired of reading stories that convince people that we
in Detroit live in little broken-down frame houses with a crack
house next door,'' Berg says.
   Urban experts say the problem of abandonment of central cities
isn't confined to the Rust Belt.
   Aggressive redevelopment of downtown areas is under way in
cities as far-flung as Boise, Idaho; Beaumont, Texas; and
Charlotte, N.C., says Ann Bowman, a political scientist at the
University of South Carolina.
   Suburban sprawl likely will continue during the 1990s, even in
cities with stronger housing markets and more aggressive
redevelopment plans than Detroit's, says H. James Brown, director
of the Joint Center for Urban Studies at Harvard University's
Kennedy School of Government.
   ``Detroit is actually leading a path that other cities may be on
in the next 10 years,'' Brown says. ``All communities are going to
find that there isn't the central city housing demand that there
has been.
   ``Even in the '70s, when it was alleged that there was a
back-to-the-city movement, young people were more likely to be
moving to the suburbs.''
   In Detroit, Berg says, the city and nine banks recently pooled
$40 million to form the Detroit Neighborhood Investment Corp.,
which provides low-interest loans for renovating existing housing.
   A few private investors have joined the reclamation effort on
their own.
   A corporation headed by Grosse Pointe developer Jim Saros bought
the 62-year-old Chalfonte Apartments on the lower east side for
$400,000. It spent an additional $700,000 to renovate the 20-unit
building that had been vacant for seven years.
   Detroit has spent $15 million to demolish 3,000 vacant
structures this fiscal year. The budget includes another $15
million to tear down 3,000 more buildings by June 30.
   ``One of the things you're doing when you knock down the
abandoned houses is do it quickly before it spreads like a
cancer,'' Berg says.
   Marcell Mayberry has seen that cancer ravage much of her lower
east-side neighborhood. Now she fears it may reach Algonquin
Street, too.
   A sagging, wood-frame bungalow next to Mayberry's house is so
far the only abandoned house on Algonquin. Mayberry cuts the grass
and joins other neighbors in keeping watch for arsonists or
vandals. She says she never sees the owner.
   The neighborhood's decline began about 10 years ago, when
absentee landlords began renting to welfare clients and neglected
their property, Mayberry says. Later came the crack dealers,
burglars and arsonists.
   Mayberry is unimpressed by Grayhaven, a condominium-marina
project under construction near her home.
   ``When this crack cocaine came in, that's when things started
disappearing,'' she says. ``It's an epidemic, and there ain't
nothing anyone can do about it. If they've got the same problems
we've got, how are Grayhaven residents going to help?''
   In Cleveland, $16 million has been spent to demolish abandoned
buildings over the past decade, says Mike Marcelino, a spokesman
for Mayor Michael White. That compares with $15 million this year
alone in Detroit, whose population is about twice that of Cleveland.
   ``When you start tearing down housing, you can quickly ruin a
street or neighborhood,'' Marcelino says. ``How's it going to
affect the houses on either side? A lot of people cannot afford a
new house.''
   Cleveland officials have created a land bank to pool vacant
property in hopes of redevelopment, says Norman Krumholtz, the
city's former planning director.
   ``In strategic locations, they assemble enough property so you
have some kind of reasonable development,'' says Krumholtz, a
professor of urban planning at Cleveland State University.
   Although the real estate market is soft in Cleveland, the land
bank lets the city ``clear the titles and sit on it until it
becomes ripe again,'' he says.
   Besides lacking specific incentives for developing large
clusters of vacant land, a 1985 revision to Detroit's 1969 master
plan still awaits City Council approval, says Councilman Mel Ravitz.
   ``We could and should be doing a whole lot more to woo investors
for residential development or rehabilitation,'' he says. ``The
city apparently has not appeared attractive enough to the
risk-taking developers.''

   He's a composer for our time, a man who writes
operas about the social condition of the modern world. Sir Michael
Tippett, though better known in his native England than in America,
has been called ``one of the three or four giant composers in the
last half of the 20th century.''

<TEXT>
   Sir Michael Tippett, the 85-year-old British
composer who was briefly jailed as a pacifist during World War II,
is a musician with a message.
   To him, the sight of young people dancing on the Berlin Wall was
``a marvelous piece of theater.'' For one thing, no shots were
fired.
   For 50 years, Sir Michael has been writing his philosophical
reflections on world events into his oratorio and opera libretti,
ever since T.S. Eliot gave him some tips for writing ``A Child of
Our Time,'' which became his first major success.
   ``A Child of Our Time'' was inspired by a young Jew who killed a
Nazi official in Paris, providing the excuse for Kristallnacht, the
prelude to the Holocaust.
   ``When I wrote `A Child of Our Time' I had to come out from any
notion that what I was writing was just for my countrymen,'' says
the silver-haired composer. ``I had to write something about a
condition that seemed to me really universal.''
   Sir Michael's opera ``King Priam'' used a Greek myth to explore
politics, power and choice. His opera ``The Ice Break'' explores
violence, racism and political turmoil.
   In ``The Knot Garden,'' one of his characters was a scarred
woman. He thought of her as a French underground fighter who'd been
tortured by the Gestapo in World War II. When the opera was
performed recently in Melbourne, Australia, the character became a
Chinese student in Tiananmen Square.
   Sir Michael, who attended the performance, approved of the
change.
   ``If a work has value, it will proceed in this way from a now to
another now,'' he says.
   Sir Peter Hall, who staged the premiere of Sir Michael's fifth
opera, ``New Year,'' last October in Houston, has called Sir
Michael ``a child of our time in each decade.
   ``There is something extremely young about him,'' he says. ``He
hasn't closed up at all.''
   The Glyndebourne Festival will stage the English premiere of
``New Year'' on July 1. BBC television will tape it and there is
talk of productions in Canada, Holland and Germany. In December,
Sir Michael finished ``Byzantium,'' which the Chicago Symphony will
premiere in April 1991 to honor Carnegie Hall's 100th birthday.
He's now composing his fifth string quartet.
   David Gockley, general director of the Houston Grand Opera,
says, ``I think he is probably one of the three or four giant
composers in the last half of the 20th century.
   ``In this country he is predominantly known for his orchestral
works. He has made the rounds of every major symphony in the last
25 years conducting his big orchestral works.
   ``In operas, he puts together these fantastical collages of
allegory. I think his philosophical approach to the problems of
complicated urbanized society has won him a great deal of friends
among young people and people that share his concerns.''
   When he was about 25, Sir Michael was strongly impressed by the
movie ``The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,'' starring Rudolph
Valentino, in which a father wanders among the white crosses of a
cemetery in Flanders.
   ``I realized all those wonderful young people had gone to the
ground and never had a life at all,'' he says. ``When it came to
the next war, it came to me that these young people could have been
scapegoats, people thrown out by a society. I had to sing in some
way about them. I could not get them out of my mind. They're there
to this day.''
   In England, where he is better known than he is in America, Sir
Michael has a fan club and members get, just as Paul McCartney's
fans do, a newsletter about his activities, performances and
recordings.
   The Kent Opera is currently taking ``King Priam'' on tour to six
cities.
   Sir Michael is conducting one recording a year of his
compositions for Nimbus Records. His eyesight is failing, making it
difficult for him to conduct concerts. Recordings are easier.
   When Covent Garden was rehearsing Sir Michael's ``The Ice
Break'' in 1977, he told a reporter he'd never write another opera.
   ``That answer was given at the time I knew I was getting on in
age and strength,'' he says. ``I had already decided I would like
to do a big work for voices and orchestra for the concert hall. It
became `The Mask of Time.'
   ``After having completed `The Mask of Time,' I still was very
vigorous and the theater took over again. I don't quite know why it
did but it did.''
   Sir Michael celebrated becoming 85 on Jan. 2 by accepting
invitations to hear his music played in several cities.
   The University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music
performed his opera ``The Knot Garden.'' Sir Michael called the
performances brilliant and the production masterly, adding, ``And
I've seen a lot of them.''
   The Cincinnati Symphony performed his lyrical ``Fantasia
Concertante on a Theme of Corelli.''
   At intermission, a young woman was overheard to say, ``I liked
the Mozart but the Tippett completely blew me away. I loved it.''
   Jesus Lopez-Cobos, music director of the Cincinnati Symphony,
says, ``I think Tippett is one of the big composers. Of British
composers, Benjamin Britten is more known here. I think Tippett's
time will come, too.''
   About Britten, Sir Michael says, ``We were mildly rivals if you
like. We both wanted to go into theater. We didn't think the operas
of the preceding generation were workable.''
   Sir Michael says that on the eve of his entering prison for
three months in World War II as a pacifist, Britten ``was much more
frightened than I was.''
   Now, he says, ``The world is changing very quickly. To my great
delight and surprise I've lived long enough to see young people
dancing on the (Berlin) Wall, a marvelous piece of theater for one
who believes you can't really do it by guns. It was done in another
way.''

   It's one of the last of the ``mom and pop''
jails, a place where serving time is a family affair. If you've got
to be locked up, the Gilmer County Jail in West Virginia would sure
beat Riker's Island in New York City.

   At Lee and Terri Frederick's place, room
guests enjoy old-fashioned home cooking and are greeted at
breakfast with a friendly, ``Good morning.''
   They can watch television, play table tennis in the recreation
room, use the telephone and entertain visitors in the family's
garage.
   But don't pack your bags for a weekend in the mountains. The
Fredericks' place is the Gilmer County Jail, one of the nation's
last ``mom and pop'' jails.
   The jail owes more to Mayberry than to Attica or Alcatraz.
   While inmates eat Terri's pasta, pizza and meat dishes in their
upstairs cells, the Fredericks are eating the same fare downstairs.
   ``I just make extra for the guys upstairs,'' Mrs. Frederick says.
   Every other Thursday, the couple pulls their 1986 Chrysler out
of their garage and sets up folding chairs so inmates can entertain
visitors.
   The Frederick's house rules are posted in the jail's recreation
room:
   ``Golden Rules: If you open it, close it. If you take it out,
lock it up. If it will brighten someone's day, SAY IT!''
   The Fredericks live with their two sons, Joey, 6, and Lynn, 2,
in a three-bedroom brick house whose upstairs cells have housed the
county's criminals for 50 years.
   The two-story building, built of flesh-colored brick, sits atop
a hill, sandwiched between the county courthouse and a Glenville
State College dormitory.
   The rest of the neighborhood is made up of modest single-family
homes that look a lot like the Frederick house, except for the bars
on the windows.
   Lee, 29, is a former truck driver who took the job of jailer a
year ago. Terri, 27, who lived in the house as a child when her
parents ran the jail, now does the cooking and cleaning.
   In her spare time, she dispatches sheriff's deputies, local
police, ambulances and rescue workers from her living room. The
room also has alarms for Glenville's two banks.
   Until recently, when a night jailer was hired, one of them was
always on duty from 7 a.m. to midnight. After that, prisoners could
summon Lee by pushing a button on the elevator that connects the
first and second floors.
   Mrs. Frederick stays in touch with wall-mounted loudspeakers
that allow her to hear calls when she's working in the kitchen.
   It's easy to know what's happening in the jail because, ``We can
hear them right through the ceiling,'' Mrs. Frederick says.
   Frederick says his sons are not allowed upstairs no matter how
curious they get.
   ``They'll find out about this stuff soon enough anyway,'' he
says.
   On an average day, the jail houses about nine prisoners, most
detained for drunken driving, destruction of property or game law
violations.
   In the evenings, prisoners play table tennis or watch television
in a family sized recreation room. They have access to the couple's
telephone every night, but long distance calls are not allowed.
   Such homey touches aren't lost on the inmates.
   ``Lee treats me OK, and the food's all right, but I just don't
like being in jail,'' says Carson Yeager, 45, who described himself
as a ``chronic alcoholic.''
   Yeager is one of the Fredericks' regulars.
   ``The majority of ours are not hardened criminals,'' Frederick
says. ``They don't need to be exposed to that type of people.''
   Some former inmates even come back to say hello occasionally. A
21-year-old former inmate, now incarcerated elsewhere, has written
the couple four letters in the last two months.
   Still, rural ``mom and pop'' jails are increasingly being phased
out because of generally substandard conditions, high maintenance
costs and a move toward regional jails.
   ``They are a rapidly dying breed,'' says Michael O'Toole, chief
of the jails division of the National Institute of Corrections.
   More than 19 million people filter through 3,300 county jails
each year, according to U.S. Justice Department statistics.
   ``Small jails are not cost effective,'' O'Toole says. ``Although
a lot are well-meaning and well-intentioned, the conditions of
confinement aren't what they should be. A lot are just incapable of
being up to standards.
   ``The operation rises and falls on the integrity of the
operator. For each example where somebody is fulfilling their
responsibility, you can look at another side of the ledger and see
someone who shouldn't have any authority over anybody in custody
whatsoever.''
   Recently the state Facilities Review Panel took aim at the
Fredericks, warning it would shut the jail down if Gilmer County
officials didn't add staff at the jail.
   So Sheriff Kenneth Smith Jr. hired a night-shift jailer and
beefed up the part-time staff so the Fredericks only have to work
40 hours a week.
   ``It's cramped our personal lives a little bit, sure,''
Frederick says.

   His mother was a maid in Memphis, Tenn., who
brought books for him to read from the white homes where she
worked. Today Eddie N. Williams heads the Joint Center for
Political Studies, a research group playing an increasingly
important role as blacks move into the political mainstream.

   Eddie N. Williams is constantly on the phone
these days fielding questions, what with black politicians so much
in the news.
   Is Jesse Jackson maintaining his hold on black voters?
   How did L. Douglas Wilder pull off his election as the first
black governor of Virginia?
   How is the indictment of Mayor Marion Barry playing among black
voters in the nation's capital?
   Those are the kinds of questions people regularly ask Williams,
president of the Joint Center for Political Studies, a little-known
research institute he has built into the country's premier black
think tank.
   The center has a staff of 60 providing research on the social,
political and economic activities and concerns of African-Americans.
   It is most well known for the annual ``Roster of Black Elected
Officials'' which has charted the growth of black officeholders
from the 600 it originally listed to the more than 7,000 now
included.
   The center now occupies a special political niche at a time when
black candidates and voters are playing an increasingly influential
role in national and local politics.
   The mainstream is the ``new frontier'' for black politicians,
Williams says, citing the 1989 elections of Wilder in Virginia and
David Dinkins as mayor of New York.
   ``That's where the jobs are,'' he says. ``All of the positions
that are in predominantly black jurisdictions have just about been
filled.''
   Largely disenfranchised in many Southern states until the
mid-1960s, blacks can now claim credit for electing Democratic
senators in places like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and North
Carolina.
   The mayors of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia,
all are black.
   Yet, 18 years ago the president of the University of Chicago was
startled to hear that Williams, his vice president for public
affairs, was leaving to head a relatively unknown research
organization.
   ``The challenge to me is to make you hear about it,'' was
Williams' response.
   The black electorate remains overwhelmingly Democratic, but two
photographs deliberately juxtaposed on a wall in Williams' office
symbolize how jealously he guards the non-partisan status of the
center.
   One shows Williams with President Bush; in the other he is with
two-time Democratic presidential contender Jackson.
   ``People don't knock the Joint Center as being liberal or
conservative or Republican or Democratic, and that's a very
difficult position for a black organization to maintain,'' says
Robert Bates, a Mobil Oil Co. lobbyist and close friend of Williams.
   ``It's a good role to be in, to call the shots as you see
them,'' says Williams. ``I'll comment on the Republicans and I'll
comment on the Democrats. I let the chips fall where they may.''
   One question Williams is asked frequently is whether President
Bush and Republican Party chairman Lee Atwater can achieve their
goal of making significant gains for the Republican Party among
black voters.
   The opportunity is there, Williams says, ``But until the
Republicans can succeed in recruiting some visible black leaders
with a following and until they disabuse themselves of the notion
that they can create a black leader they're going to only be
modestly successful.''
   Williams, 57, was born in Memphis, Tenn., the only child of Ed
Williams, a one-armed jazz piano player and his wife, Georgia, a
maid at hotels and well-to-do private homes in the city.
   From her, Williams learned the value of finding and assembling
seemingly evasive information.
   Williams says his mother would often bring home books, clothes
and other artifacts from the homes in which she worked.
   ``This is what that white boy's reading, now you ought to be
reading it,'' Williams recalls her saying. He says he read the
materials that were otherwise not available to black children in
the segregated school systems of the South during the 1930s and
1940s.
   Bebe Bowers Fingall, a high school English teacher called
``mama'' by her students, helped hone Williams' competitive spirit
and self-confidence.
   Williams says that as one of ``mama's pets,'' he was drawn
toward all kinds of writing and speaking anthologies and plays.
   After earning a bachelor's degree in journalism from the
University of Illinois, he did graduate work in political science
at Atlanta and Howard universities.
   Williams also served as director of the Center for Policy
Studies at the University of Chicago. He was director of the U.S.
Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and a foreign service
reserve officer at the State Department.
   Williams has two children _ a son, Edward, 24, who is a graduate
student at the Peabody School of Music at Johns Hopkins University,
and a daughter, Tracy, 26, who is an actress at the Living Stage
Theater in Washington, D.C.
   His 21-year-old stepson, Terrence Reddick, is a senior at George
Mason University in Virginia.
   But his baby is the Joint Center for Political Studies, as
reflected on the wall of his office in a framed and matted
paraphrase of a popular slogan: ``Have you hugged your 501 (c) 3
today?'' _ a reference to the section in U.S. law that grants
tax-exempt status to non-profit organizations.
   The center is funded by $3 million a year in grants from private
foundations and corporations.
   ``What he has done is to provide a place for substantial, high
quality, objective research where none existed before,'' says
Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, a
conservative Washington think tank.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., the oldest and longest-serving
black member of the House and chairman of the Education and Labor
Committee, says he calls on the center's statistical data and
analysis on a variety of issues, ``if I want to focus in on a
minority viewpoint or get the specifics.''
   The unofficial link between black elected officials and center
dates to its beginning when noted black psychologist Kenneth Clark
and several of the country's then-leading black politicians founded
the center and secured a $2 million grant from the Ford Foundation.
   Williams hopes to secure the center's financial future with a
$10 million endowment. The Ford Foundation has pledged $5 million,
which Williams is working to match.
   The center, which celebrated its 20th anniversary this month,
opened its doors in 1970 to provide technical assistance to a newly
emerging cadre of black elected officials from the ranks of
teachers, preachers, farmers and local community activists.
   ``Our role was to help them better understand the processes of
governance, to share some information and some expertise about
administration, planning, budgeting, identification of resource
acquisition _ those kinds of technical things,'' Williams says.
   The center also served to document the nature and extent of
black political participation, he says.

   Actor Ed Begley Jr., who frequently arrives
at work on a city bus, comes for an interview this day on a bicycle.
   He sheds his backpack and plastic foam helmet and sits down to
talk about USA Network's first miniseries, ``Not a Penny More, Not
a Penny Less,'' to be televised Tuesday and Wednesday. Later, he
will ride over the Hollywood Hills to Paramount Studios for some
preliminary work on his forthcoming NBC series ``Parenthood.''
   In the four-hour, two-part miniseries on USA, Begley plays an
American teacher at Oxford University who organizes a sting. He and
three Englishmen have lost a bundle in a stock swindle and want
their money back. They devise their own swindles that appeal to the
ego of the crooked financier played by Edward Asner.
   The lighthearted adventure, based on the novel by Jeffrey Archer
and adapted by Sherman Yellen, was filmed on location in England
and Monte Carlo by director Clive Donner. It also stars Maryam
d'Abo, Jenny Agutter, Brian Protheroe, Nicholas Jones and
Francois-Eric Gendron.
   ``My character on `Not a Penny More' was the ringleader,''
Begley says. ``We were trying to get our money back from Ed Asner.
I come up with the plan, but the others are not convinced it will
work.''
   In ``Parenthood,'' Begley will play the role Steve Martin had in
the hit movie. Producer-director Ron Howard, producer Brian Grazer
and writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel will also be working on
the series.
   ``We're going to shoot `Parenthood' at a little studio past
Valencia,'' Begley says. ``That's 20 miles north of here. I'll ride
my bike up this weekend to see what it's like. If it's a grind,
I'll take the bus. And if there's no bus, I'll have to take the car.
   ``I've eliminated that fix we all have for the automobile. I'm a
person who runs around a lot. Riding the bus has made me slow down.
It's been good for me.''
   Begley is probably best known for his role as Dr. Victor Ehrlich
on ``St. Elsewhere.'' But he's also become very active in movies.
He was caught between Meryl Streep and Roseanne Barr in
``She-Devil.''
   He'll soon be seen in ``Meet the Applegates,'' about an
All-American family that probably has an aversion to insect spray.
   ``They're really large invasive bugs from South America who can
adapt to any environment,'' Begley says. ``They turn themselves
into human beings and become the Applegates.''
   The movie also stars Dabney Coleman and Stockard Channing.
   Begley was born into an acting family and started his own career
as a teen-ager. His father was Academy Award-winning actor Ed
Begley (``Sweet Bird of Youth'') and his mother actress Jean Joyce.
   Begley began his acting career on ``My Three Sons'' when he was
about 17.
   ``The first time I was ever noticed was on `Room 222,''' he
says. ``I was on six or seven times playing students. I was Bob. I
was Stretch Webster.''
   Begley was born in Los Angeles and went to grade school in New
York.
   ``My parents were doing a lot of work on the stage,'' he says.
``I came back here for high school and college. I used to go back
and forth between the coasts. I loved the trains.''
   He got his first taste of fame on ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman.'' He played a deaf-mute who was the boyfriend of Mary's
sister. His fame didn't last long, however. He was in such movies
as ``The In-Laws'' and ``Cat People.''
   ``Then `St. Elsewhere' came along and things got better,'' he
says. ``I was asked to be host of `Saturday Night Live.' That was a
dream come true for a comedian.
   ``Ehrlich was a very noticeable character on `St. Elsewhere.''
People seemed to like to dislike him. I've been working ever
since.''
   Begley says his greatest regret is that he never got to work
with his father, who died in 1970.

   It may seem odd for Kevin Kline to play a
philandering pizza parlor owner in the outrageous new film ``I Love
You to Death'' and then star in and direct ``Hamlet'' off-Broadway.
   But the versatile, good-looking actor shuttles from big-budget
movie to Shakespeare classic with ease. It's something he has done
for the last decade or so, alternating big-league Bard like
``Richard III,'' ``Henry V'' and ``Much Ado About Nothing'' with
films like ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``Silverado'' and ``A Fish Called
Wanda.''
   ``I Love You to Death'' is black comedy opera buffo _ without
the music. It's a flamboyant motion picture filled with purple
passion and banana-peel humor, as a mousy wife (Tracey Ullman)
tries _ again and again _ to murder her adulterous husband (Kline).
   Not exactly the melancholy Dane, which is Kline's other current
project, and now on view at the New York Shakespeare Festival
Public Theater. It's a role he first did there four years ago, and
his return to it is a rarity. American actors usually don't get a
second chance with ``Hamlet.''
   ``In England, there is a tradition of doing `Hamlet' twice, and
I can understand why,'' the genial, soft-spoken Kline was saying
the other day. ``Like any great classical part, you can only get
part of it when you do it once. There are so many different ways to
go. It's the biggest open door in theater.''
   Kline's initial attempt at ``Hamlet'' in 1986 was thoughtful,
clear-spoken and introspective, but the production, directed by
Liviu Ciulei, received mixed reviews.
   ``There were rumors that I was unhappy with my first `Hamlet,'
'' he says. ``Of course, I was unhappy with it. I'll be unhappy
with this one. There is no way to be completely satisfied with any
given production of `Hamlet' and there's also no way to satisfy a
large group of people. It's like a Rorschach test. Everybody has
their very own personal response to the play.''
   While preparing for that first ``Hamlet,'' Kline knew he would
do it a second time. It was something he and Joseph Papp, head of
the Shakespeare Festival, knew they would do. ``Going into it, I
said, `I don't want to do this just once,''' Kline recalls, and
Papp agreed.
   What he hadn't planned on was directing the play himself _ his
first job at directing. Steven Berkoff, who did a striking, modern
dress ``Coriolanus'' at the Public Theater, was to have directed
the new production, but the success of his version of Oscar Wilde's
``Salome'' in London kept him in England.
   With Papp's blessing, Kline took over.
   ``It was a decision that was arrived at spontaneously after
years and years of thinking about it,'' Kline jokes. ``I had been
thinking about directing for a couple of years and suggested it to
Joe. I thought, `Why not direct a play I know pretty well?' There's
no way you can know a play better than having played so central a
character.''
   For the first time in his career, Kline became involved in an
entire production, not only the direction but the design _ sets,
costumes and lighting _ and casting.
   Was it odd sitting on the other side of the fence, auditioning
his fellow performers?
   ``I love actors, and I have a great sympathy for the audition
process, which is one of the more barbaric aspects of show
business,'' Kline says. ``I'm not a good auditioner myself. So I
take each audition with a grain of salt. You can't show everything
in an audition.''
   He knew the work of some of the actors, like Brian Murray, who
plays Claudius, and Dana Ivey, who plays Gertrude, so well that he
didn't ask them to audition. Others he did, sometimes even getting
up on stage to act out scenes with them.
   ``A lot of them said, `If it doesn't happen, it was fun working
on it,''' Kline says. ``They knew that they couldn't all be in it.
The director simply has to find the actor who is best suited for
each role.''
   Ask Kline about his ideas for ``Hamlet,'' and he hesitates,
begging off answering since he had just started rehearsals. But
it's not one of those weird productions that set the play in Mexico
in the 19th century or some other exotic place and time, he reveals.
   ``It's a `non-concept' concept production,'' he laughs. ``Right
now, it takes place where it did in Shakespeare's time, on a stage
that is Denmark, but Shakespeare's Denmark. We are just taking our
cues from the play.''
   And that's how h  HOUSTON (AP) _ The number of w and natural gas
rigs declined ount showed a modest decrease after posting a gain of
53 rigs the previous week. A year ago, the count was 778, Baker
Hughes said Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Texas and Colorado lost nine
rigs each, Ohio was down by three and North Dakota was down two.
   New Mexico's count increased by three rigs and the counts in
California and Louisiana each increased by one.

   ``Pale'' (Columbia) _ Toad the Wet Sprocket
   
   Toad the Wet Sprocket's new album, ``Pale,'' exemplifies
everything that's wrong about the wheezing alternative rock scene.
   Far from the cutting edge, the underground scene has too many
imitators instead of innovators. The reigning gods are still
R.E.M., which methodically built a successful career with
originality and relentless work.
   Since the early 1980s, R.E.M. has had more impersonators than
the late Elvis Presley. Toad the Wet Sprocket is only the latest to
emulate the form rather than the substance of R.E.M.
   ``Pale'' is loaded with moody, slightly incongruous lyrics. The
guitar rock mixes the jangle and the drone. The cover's a grainy
picture of something indistinguishable and the band photo is blurry.
   Sound familiar?
   Admittedly, the failure of an entire genre is a tough burden to
place on the shoulders of an unassuming California rock band.
They're somewhat adept interpreters; the sound is more muscular
than ``Murmur''-era R.E.M., though the songs, of course, lack
distinctiveness.
   But it would be far better to see bands try to make their mark
with their own visions rather than someone else's.

   Trumpet Concertos (Telarc) _ Rolf Smedvig, trumpet; Scottish</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Jahja Ling
   
   Rolf Smedvig has recorded frequently as a member of the
superlative Empire Brass Quintet and played six years with the
Boston Symphony, joining the orchestra at the remarkable age of 19.
   Surprisingly, this is his first solo endeavor on disc. It's a
good one. His playing has life and spirit, and Smedvig knows how to
scale his performance up or down for the work at hand. He also has
a wonderful mellow tone that can even fool the listener into
hearing an oboe.
   Aside from the Haydn E-flat concerto, he doesn't have much
top-quality raw material with which to work. But then, all trumpet
soloists have to deal with a narrow field.
   Another work on the program is the E-flat concerto by Johann
Nepomuk Hummel, one of history's corrections. That is, he was
tremendously popular and highly regarded in his day, but has since
fallen into a deserved obscurity.
   His concerto is second-rate and uninteresting, yet a staple of
the instrument. Nevertheless, Smedvig calls attention to the
pleasing moments in this work.
   He also displays some beautiful legato playing in the Haydn
Andante. Ling and the Scottish players make an excellent
contribution in this piece, and are first-rate in general.
   Also on the program is a routine Baroque concerto by Giuseppe
Torelli; a nicely tossed-off piece of fluff by a young Vincenzo
Bellini originally written for oboe; and a transcription of a
violin concerto by Giuseppe Tartini.
   The last work has a striking andante movement with lovely,
bittersweet melodies. It seems destined for plunder by a wine
advertiser looking for a bucolic soundtrack.

   In 1889, George Eastman wrote to a
colleague that the potential market for his new easy-to-use camera
and film was ``immense.''
   ``There is more millions in it than anything else,'' the founder
of Eastman Kodak Co. said. ``If we can fully control it, I would
not trade it for the telephone.''
   The story of Eastman's millions and his exceptional success in
the fledgling photography industry is chronicled in the 45,600
letters he wrote and received from 1880 to his death in 1932. The
letters were donated this week by Kodak to the International Museum
of Photography at George Eastman House. It is the first time the
collection has been made open to the public.
   The letters, some handwritten by Eastman in large, looping
script, fill 18 shelves of gray boxes and leather-bound volumes in
a cellar at Kodak's Rochester headquarters. They provide insights
into a broad slice of American history _ from the specifications
for a pair of carriage horses to Eastman's opinions on the layout
of downtown Rochester, from turn-of-the-century legal and political
issues to the development of modern photography.
   The collection includes letters to and from many of the most
important inventors, photographers, businessmen and educators of
the day, as well as correspondence with four United States
presidents.
   There is a 13-year correspondence with educator Booker T.
Washington. Washington's Tuskegee Institute was one of many
educational and charitable institutions to which Eastman donated
millions of dollars over his lifetime.
   Another correspondent was Franklin D. Roosevelt. In 1927,
Eastman donated a ``Moving Picture Machine'' to Roosevelt's Warm
Springs Foundation for victims of Infantile Paralysis, so that
doctors could record patients' movements.
   Eastman did not refrain from expressing his strong opinions in
his letters. He vehemently opposed the U.S. government's policy of
neutrality in the World War I, and was exasperated with auto
magnate Henry Ford, a prominent pacifist.
   ``This neutral talk makes me sick,'' Eastman wrote in 1915 to a
friend in London. ``And as for Henry Ford, he makes me sick and
tired.''
   Charles Apfelbaum, a New York rare book collector who helped
appraise the collection, called the letters ``one of the greatest
archival collections in America.''
   The collection was estimated to be worth $750,000, but
appraisers said it could be worth more than $1.5 million if the
letters were sold individually.
   ``Rarely has the history and development of an important
technical subject, photography in all its phases, been so dominated
by one person,'' Apfelbaum said. ``The history of 20th century
photography is here in these files.''
   Eastman perfected his system of mass-producing dry photographic
plates in 1880 and began their commercial manufacture. The dry
plates were a great advance over the chemicals and water tanks that
earlier photographers had to lug with them.
   The young industrialist, who had dropped out of school at age 14
to support his family, spent much of the next decade experimenting
with lighter and more flexible substitutes for glass plates.
   In 1887, a chemist hired by Eastman found the emulsion he was
looking for, one that was ``quick and plucky and keeps.''
   ``The new film is the `slickest' product we ever tried to make,
and its method of manufacture will eliminate all of the defects
hitherto experienced in film manufacture,'' he wrote to a colleague.
   ``The new film anybody can work,'' he wrote to a dealer. It was
absolutely certain that it would ``entirely replace glass plates,
at least for amateur work, at once or as fast as the goods can be
made.''
   By the end of the decade, Eastman had more orders than he could
fill at his Rochester plant. ``We could do double the business if
we could turn out the goods,'' he wrote to his business partner,
Henry A. Strong, in 1990.
   As the company expanded, Eastman stayed involved in every facet
of the business _ from ordering chemicals and inspecting
construction blueprints to distributing dividends.
   ``My regular business takes every minute day and night that I
can spare from sleep,'' he said in an 1889 letter declining an
offer to invest in another business.
   Eastman was a detail man in his personal as well as business
life, whether writing a furniture maker with precise instructions
for the design of his piano legs, reviewing the medical records of
his cows, giving directions for the cultivation of corn on his
North Carolina farm or ordering his favorite brand of Java coffee.
   An 1898 letter contained a list of specifications for the
bicycle Eastman was ordering.
   ``I have no use for a brake,'' he wrote. ``I think they are very
dangerous things.''
   Despite its successes, Eastman's young company was plagued with
legal wrangling over patent infringements, antitrust suits, and
injunctions to stop former employees from stealing company secrets.
   In an 1898 letter written shortly after the American victory
over the Spanish at Manila Bay, Eastman commented on the steady
stream of lawsuits.
   ``Everybody here is feeling jubilant over the first reports of
the Manila victory,'' he wrote. ``Peace extends only to private
life, however. In business it is war all the time.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: From a Scream to a Whisper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margo Timmins was thinking about the house near
Montreal where she lived with her parents and five siblings. ``A
huge playground'' is how the singer for Cowboy Junkies described it
_ big rooms, high ceilings and a winding staircase in back.
   It was there that Timmins and her brother, Michael, argued about
Elton John records, never dreaming that one day they'd form a band
of their own.
   And it was there that she taught herself to sing, dropping
embarrassing attempts to belt it out like Pat Benatar, lowering her
voice from a scream to a whisper.
   ``I decided when I sang quietly, at home, when I was singing
around the house, that's when I had control of my voice,'' Timmins
said in gentle tones at the Manhattan offices of RCA Records.
   ``Right from the beginning, I was aware that being a good singer
was phrasing. I realized when I sang around the house, I could
phrase a lot better, I could twist words, I could go up and down.''
   Fans heard her loud and clear, purchasing nearly a million
copies of the Junkies' ``The Trinity Session,'' and critics were
also impressed, frequently placing the album among their 10 best of
1988.
   Only the sound men had trouble adjusting.
   ``In the early days, I had more sound men cursing at me, saying,
`You have to sing louder.'' I said, `No, You figure out how to get
me out there.' When I started to sing lower and quieter, everyone
became quiet so they could hear me.''
   ``The Trinity Session,'' the Junkies' second album, was recorded
in 14 hours at the Trinity Church in Toronto, costing a tidy sum of
$250. The sound was as lean as the budget, blues and country
chilled by the arctic air of that November day. On covers of ``Blue
Moon'' and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' Timmins' phrasing is as
dry as powdered snow, the words in danger of snapping like frozen
twigs.
   ```The Trinity Session' was something we worked really hard
on,'' Timmins recalled. ``We had day jobs as well at that point,
and every night we would come together for five months prior to
recording it. We were so focused. These songs, we knew they were
good. We knew they filled us with something.''
   It was a hard act to follow. Impossible, the Junkies learned.
   Last spring, they went to a wooden temple nearby, built by
Quakers in 1830, and recorded their followup record, to be released
in September. After returning from a European tour, they gave the
album another listen and changed their minds.
   ``It sounded old,'' Timmins said. ``But I think that's when we
realized that no one was pressuring us to put an album out, that we
could take our time.
   ``When we realized this isn't what we want on this album, we
thought, `Let's do it again,' and did it in November. We sort of
got rid of that time pressure we imposed and relaxed about it and
did it our way.''
   Appropriately titled ``The Caution Horses,'' the album has eight
originals, _ seven by Michael Timmins and one (``Witches'') by both
siblings _ plus covers of fellow Canadians Neil Young
(``Powderfinger'') and Mary Margaret O'Hara (``You Will Be Loved
Again'').
   The atmosphere is filtered through the utterly modern 48-track
digital equipment of Toronto's Eastern Sound studio. This time, the
Junkies are less interested in a single mood than in a series of
moods, 10 different takes on modern love. The music, warmed to room
temperature, is looser, fuller, with more of a country feel.
   ``We were aware that some people wouldn't want us to break away
from that purist way of recording,'' Timmins said. ``If we went
into a studio we knew that people would be mad and if we did more
low-key songs, we knew they'd say it's just the same.''
   Timmins can turn lyrics into snapshots. ``It's the kind of night
where it's so cold and you spit,'' she sings in ``Cheap Is How I
Feel,'' pausing midway, ``it freezes before it hits the ground.''
Beds, bars, cars and mirrors also pop up.
   Thank the Canadian weather and abundance of space for the
Junkies' visual approach to music.
   ``I think that we really have a picturesque kind of way of
dealing with things. Everything's gray for six months out of the
year, so you better have a big imagination. You're locked inside
and you read a lot.''
   ``To me the songs on the new album are stories that have to be
made believable,'' she said. ``There's a time and a place and a
message and a mood, like short stories. That's the way I approached
them, basically, because that's the way I read them when Mike
handed them to me.''
   The quintessential Junkie, Timmons says, is shy, aloof, like
bassist Alan Anton. Timmins insists that she's not shy, but quiet _
a big difference. Approach her at a party and she'll talk to you
all night. Approach her for an interview, and she just might find a
little extra time in her schedule.
   ``I think there must be a part of me inside that wants the
attention, otherwise I wouldn't allow it to happen. I do enjoy
buying a magazine and seeing my picture.
   ``But there are limits to that. If it's a choice between
visiting my mom in Florida and getting my picture taken, then I'll
see my mom. Although, if I can take the photographer along I'll do
both.''

   UAL Corp.'s directors agreed to a $4.38 billion

   The price tag on the savings and loan bailout
could hit $500 billion if the economy falters, congressional
auditors said in their bleakest assessment of the thrift crisis yet.
   The General Accounting Office said Friday it would cost the
government at least $325 billion to close or sell failed savings
institutions. That's greater than the Pentagon's annual budget.
   But even the new projection, a sharp 26 percent higher than the
$257 billion estimate offered by the GAO only five months ago, is
optimistic, said Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who heads

<HEAD>March Oil Output Highest Since 1981: Newsletter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC member nations produced an estimated
24.09 million barrels a day of crude oil in March, the highest
monthly output since 1981, the weekly Middle East Economic Survey
reported Monday.
   The influential newsletter said the production was up from 23.62
million barrels per day in February and 23.32 million in January.
Daily production in December was only slightly lower at 24 million.
   The newsletter said Iran showed the biggest increase in
production, jumping from 2.8 million barrels a day in February to
3.15 million in March.
   It is the first time since August that Iran has been able to
produce at the level of its 3.14 million barrels per day quota
assigned under the cartel's shared production system.
   ``Observers will be interested to see whether their level can be
sustained in the coming months,'' the newsletter said. Export
facilities were severely damaged during the 1980-88 war with Iraq,
but the government made repairs its first priority.
   The overall production level was well above the ceiling of 22.1
million barrels per day that the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed on for production in the first six
months of 1990. Some members, led by the United Arab Emirates and
Kuwait, have been ignoring their production quotas and calling for
their abolition.
   Last week, the Paris-based International Energy Agency estimated
March production at 23.7 million barrels a day.
   Oil prices soared in January but have been gradually slipping
since, falling in early March below the cartel's target of $18 a
barrel to about $17.75 for the average of a basket of seven crude
oils.
   The newsletter said the supply and demand for OPEC crude are
``roughly in balance.''

<HEAD>GM Head Warns of Raised Expectations From Trade Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of General Motors Corp. today warned
that recent U.S.-Japan trade talks could lead to undesirable new
American laws if current high U.S. expectations are not met.
   Most trade talks between the two nations have focused on
improved market access for particular products.
   But last week's negotiations dealt with business practices and
customs in both countries that have worsened their trade imbalance,
which has stood at about $50 billion for several years.
   ``I am not a Japan-basher, and never will be,'' said Roger
Smith, chairman of the world's largest automaker. ``But we have to
learn to trade together. And I look for Japanese companies to take
the leadership in helping resolve these trade issues. We should not
have governments trying to resolve some of these trade issues.''
   In the trade talks, Japan pledged to alter its Anti-Monopoly Law
to provide foreign companies more access to business opportunities
by reducing Japanese business collusion. It also promised to reduce
restrictions on the opening of large-scale stores, which U.S. trade
officials say are more likely to sell imported products.
   ``I don't know whether that's going to be good for trade or bad
for trade, because it's going to raise expectations, but if it
doesn't produce results to lower that $50 billion trade deficit, it
may backfire in Congress and bring on some unwanted rules,'' Smith
said.
   He said Japanese customs and attitudes have blocked sales of
U.S. cars in Japan, and warned that such non-tariff barriers were
dangerous.
   ``I don't think you need those barriers, and I think they are
very dangerous, because they are the things that the people in the
United States hold up as an example and say, `See, you can't trust
the Japanese','' he told reporters at the Japan National Press Club.
   The record 182,168 cars, trucks and buses that Japan imported in
1989 accounted for only about 3 percent of the 5.8 million vehicles
sold during the year. The imported passenger cars included 120,293
from West Germany, 19,084 from the United States, 14,519 from
Britain and 10,487 from France, the Japan Automobile Importers'
Association said.
   Smith, who is retiring in July, arrived in Japan Thursday on a
farewell visit, GM officials said.

   The gears grind, the engine growls and the
rig jumps a curb, bumps into a shiny Corvette and rolls over a stop
sign.
   At the hands of an untrained driver, a 45-foot trailer truck can
do a lot of damage. But, in what Doron Precision Systems Inc., says
is the world's first affordable truck driver training simulator,
all the damage is to the ego.
   The truck and the Corvette weigh only a few pounds, and the
scene out the windows is a four-screen, live TV show.
   ``Step on the gas, you can't hurt a thing,'' said Doron
President Carl Wenzinger as a first-time truck driver took the
wheel, checked his mirrors, let out the clutch and attempted to
back up to a dock at the end of a narrow alley.
   Doron is the company that builds those futuristic capsules that
rock and roll a dozen shopping mall patrons at a time through a
filmed roller coaster adventure, a San Francisco cable car ride or
a helicopter flight over Manhattan.
   But Wenzinger said his first and still most important business
is creating realistic training devices for car, bus and truck
drivers. The Binghamton, N.Y., company claims to be the world
leader in audio-visual driver training equipment.
   ``This is not a video game,'' Wenzinger said. ``We are in the
serious business of traffic safety.''
   The company is keeping parts of its new L-300 Vehicle
Maneuvering Trainer system secret behind black plastic sheets
during public showings until all of the patents are accepted.
   But what was uncovered in a demonstration last week was a
life-sized cab complete with steering wheel and most of the gauges
and controls of a normal truck, two video projectors for a sweeping
view of the road, and two 24-inch television sets for side windows
with inset rear-view mirrors.
   Wenzinger also acknowledged what was not immediately obvious
until the silver Corvette at the side of the road bounced rather
than crunched _ the L-300's driver is actually controlling a scale
model which can either be placed in another room or stacked on top
of the cab. The scene includes a cab and trailer mounted with
miniature video cameras.
   ``It doesn't make sense to tie up an instructor fulltime in the
front seat,'' Wenzinger said.
   The whole thing could fit into a large living room. The cost:
about $130,000, compared to several million dollars for airplane or
railroad simulators that use computer-generated images.
   The difference in conducting training in an L-300 and a real
truck, Wenzinger said, is that the trainee burns no fuel, can't
destroy the transmission, doesn't wear out the tires or brakes and
can't damage the training course.
   It also saves on instructors, he said. One can monitor several
simulators at a time.
   The disadvantage is that the machine can't simulate highway
driving. The model would have to be too big. Some of the training
still has to be in a classroom simulator with a movie screen or in
a real rig.
   The first two L-300 simulators are to be delivered late this
month to the Pinellas Technical Education Center, run by Pinellas
County, Fla.
   ``I think it's fantastic,'' said Warren Laux, principal of the
school's St. Petersburg campus.
   ``I felt a lot of anxiety in driving it and didn't want people
watching me,'' said Laux after test-driving the L-300. ``I'd rather
have students get those feelings in a simlulator than in a $100,000
piece of equipment they could ruin.''
   Models could be constructed to duplicate most conditions a
driver might face in turning, parking or docking, said David
Lindsey, director of truck fleet operations for Doron.
   Lindsey said courses could simulate rugged terrain for training
in military vehicles or a school yard or city street for bus-driver
training.

   The stock market inched ahead in light trading
today, getting off to a sluggish start on a new week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 2.25 to 2,719.37 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 505 up, 436 down and
502 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.25 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Japanese stocks surged upward today, rebounding from their drop
of more than 25 percent since the start of the year. The Nikkei
index of 225 Japanese issues soared nearly 4 percent.
   But little of that bargain-hunting enthusiasm was transmitted to
the U.S. market.
   Brokers noted that many observers had regarded the selloff in
Tokyo as largely an isolated phenomenon, reflecting forces within
the market there.
   Since the American markets did not share much in Tokyo's
malaise, analysts said, it stood to reason that they would also not
play much of a part in the recovery.
   Gainers among U.S. blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up \ at 41~; Philip Morris, up &rsqb; at 41|; DuPont, up &rsqb; at
38\, and International Paper, up \ at 51{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.31 to 187.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .57 at 360.44.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 4.05 to
2,717.12, reducing its gain for the week to 9.91 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 596 up, 864 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 137.49 million shares, against 144.17
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Narrowly Mixed in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting a variety of supply-and-demand developments.
   The soybean market was mostly higher amid perceptions that the
Soviet Union is shopping for U.S. soybeans and soybean meal.
   Soybean futures also were supported by strength in the European
meal market and by reports that wet weather over the weekend caused
soybean harvest delays in South America.
   Corn futures were fractionally lower on profit-taking after last
week's gains. Friday's Agriculture Department announcement that the
Soviets bought 750,000 metric tons of U.S. corn was discounted by
the market, which had risen sharply before the announcement on
rumors of a large Soviet purchase.
   Wheat was very narrowly mixed. Forecasts for mild, rainy weather
in the winter wheat belt prompted selling that offset buying linked
to fears that cold weekend temperatures may have caused some frost
damage to the crop.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.66 a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent to } cent lower with May at $2.68} a
bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with May at $1.51 a
bushel; soybeans were \ cent lower to } cent higher with May at
$5.96 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were unchanged to .10 cent higher with April
at 79.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .15 cent
higher with April at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent
to .53 cent higher with April at 54.60 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .12 cent lower to .30 cent higher with May at 54.75
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures advanced on Friday while pork futures were mixed.

<TEXT>
   Formal talks have broken off between two rival
groups promoting different versions of AT&amp;T's Unix computer
software, though the groups said they have agreed to certain
standards.
   However, the groups said they determined that a merger of the
rivals ``could not be practically achieved at this time.''
   One of the groups, Unix International, was set up by American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. The other, the Open Software Foundation,
was established by such AT&amp;T rivals as International Business
Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Siemen's AG of West
Germany.
   The groups are vying for control of the Unix operating system, a
base layer of software that fast is becoming an industry standard.
But different versions of Unix have sprung up since AT&amp;T invented
it, meaning computers running on one version are not compatible
with those running on another.
   The Open Software Foundation was established by the AT&amp;T rivals
in 1988 when they became concerned that the phone giant was trying
to retain control of Unix rather than allow it to become an
industry standard.
   In response, AT&amp;T formed Unix International and ceded control of
its versions of Unix to the group.
   The two groups said in November they were involved in formal
discusssions on cooperation aimed at ending the perception they
were rivals.
   Today they said the talks had concluded, but that informal
discussions would continue. Among the progress the groups cited
were agreements to adhere to a number of industry standards.

<HEAD>Study: Unification Could Boost Economy In West Germany,
Unemployment In East</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland-Layoffs Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The planned union between West and
East Germany should prevent a West Germany economic slowdown over
the next two years, experts said Monday, but they reiterated
concerns that East German unemployment could soar.
   West Germany's five leading economic research institutes said
increased demand resulting from the economic reconstruction of East
Germany likely will prevent a significant slowdown in West German
growth.
   Klaus-Werner Schatz, an economist at the Institute for World
Economics in Kiel, said the five institutes expect growth to slow
marginally to 3.75 percent in 1990 from 4 percent in 1989. In 1991,
they expect the economy to grow at an almost similar pace.
   In 1991, growth should be 1.5 percentage points higher than it
would have been without economic union, said Schatz.
   West Germany has launched plans to create an economic union with
East Germany on the road to German unification. Under such a union,
West Germany virtually would control East Germany's economy as it
rebuilds its eastern neighbor.
   Monetary union, in which West Germany's strong mark will replace
East Germany's nearly worthless currency, is a central part of
plans for economic union.
   Some West Germans have raised concerns that unification could
prove to be a heavy economic burden.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said Monday
part of the costs of unification could be covered by spending less
on defense. Some opposition politicians have said West Germany will
have to raise taxes to cover the high price for unity.
   But the five institutes said West German growth likely would
handle unification costs.
   ``In the mid-term, tax increases ... will not be necessary,''
Schatz said.
   But Schatz also called on West German and East German
politicians to take the necessary steps to preserve East German
jobs as the two nations negotiate the terms of currency union.
   East German politicians are pressing for a general 1-to-1 swap
of East German marks for West German marks. But Western financial
experts continually have warned that could create high unemployment
in East Germany because it would increase businesses' debts as well
as their payrolls.
   Some forecasts have said 2 million East Germans could lose their
jobs under such a plan.
   In their report, the five institutes said strong economic growth
in West Germany over the next two years hinges on East Germany
scrapping its planned economy in favor of a free-market system.
   West Germany's economic, legal and tax systems will have to be
adopted by East Germany, the experts said.
   Schatz said East Germany will face ``enormous pressures'' during
the transition to a market-economy system. But he said those same
pressures ``bring great advantages.''
   He said that after East Germany's full ``entry into a
market-economy system ... in a short time an enormous production
impulse will be realized.''
   In addition, East Germans will have to pay far less for Western
imports then they do now, he said.
   According to Schatz, as East Germany's economic health recovers,
that will provide a bonus for West Germany's economy as well.
   ``The economic reconstruction (of East Germany) will lead to a
high need for investment goods, which without a doubt will be met
for the most part by deliveries from the Federal Republic (West
Germany),'' said Schatz.
   He said East German demand for West German consumer goods likely
will increase immediately after monetary union is implemented,
which may occur as early as July 1.
   The economic forecasts were conducted jointly by the Ifo
Economic Research Institute in Munich, the German Institute for
Economic Research in West Berlin, the RWI Economic Research
Institute in Essen, the Institute for World Economics in Kiel, and
the HWWA Institute for Economic Research in Hamburg.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell Monday against other major
currencies in Europe after an early round of intervention by most
Group of Seven nations.
   Gold prices also declined.
   Dealers said early intervention helped send skittish buyers to
the sidelines.
   But the flurry of dollar selling against the yen by the major
European central banks didn't help the Japanese currency because
the market does not believe the G-7 is committed to supporting it,
dealers said.
   The finance ministers of the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada agreed at their meeting in Paris
on Saturday that the yen's recent downswing could have
``undesirable consequences.''
   But they only said they would keep developments under review.
   The absence of the Federal Reserve until late European dealings
helped underpin the dollar, dealers said. But even after the Fed
stepped in selling the dollar at 157 yen, the dollar didn't find
any significant market selling, they said.
   One British corporate dealer said: ``The market wants Japan to
raise its interest rates.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.02 yen to 156.45 yen Monday. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a higher rate of 157.28 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday:
1.6923 German marks, down from 1.6941; 1.4960 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4992; 5.6805 French francs, down from 5.6942; 1.9043 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9070; 1,242.00 Italian lire, down from
1,245.50; and 1.1615 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1652.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6397 from $1.6385 late
Friday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $375.50 a troy ounce
from $378 Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $376.25 an ounce from
$378 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.92 to close at $379.13 an
ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.14 a
troy ounce from Friday's $5.13.

   Shares closed modestly higher Monday on London's
Stock Exchange after the market spent the day drifting lazily

   Dealers said investors were sticking to the sidelines on the
first full day of a new trading account and as the long Easter
holiday weekend approached.
   The exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week
trading periods for accounting purposes.
   ``It's going to be a quiet week, I'm afraid,'' one British
equities dealer said.
   A sharp rebound in Tokyo earlier Monday and a relatively steady
Wall Street bolstered the London market, dealers said. They also
cited a shortage of some stocks.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 6.6

<HEAD>Firm Buys Drexel's Junk Bond Data Base, Software</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Brothers Inc. said Monday it had
acquired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s black book on junk bonds,
including details on thousands of issuers and investors that made
up the firm's fabled money-raising network.
   The purchase covers Drexel's data base containing information on
more than 3,000 public and private issues of high-yield bonds.
   The data base also contains information on the junk holdings of
about 1,000 institutional investors _ the insurance companies,
mutual funds and savings and loans that Drexel tapped to raise
billions of dollars for smaller companies and takeover artists in
the 1980s.
   Along with the data base, Salomon is obtaining computer software
that will give its sales, trading and research staff access to
descriptions of securities in the data base, histories of their
trading prices, research and other information.
   ``There's considerable value in all of that,'' said Mark Field,
head of high-yield sales at Salomon. ``This puts us in the center
of the securities holders.''
   The high-yield system also includes management reporting, back
office and recordkeeping features, Salomon said.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed, but Drexel said Salomon's
bid was the highest from among 15 firms that had expressed interest
in the assets.
   ``The purchase of this system, along with the recent addition of
several experienced high-yield professionals, merely serves to
underscore our continued long-term commitment to the high-yield
market,'' C. Daniel Tyree, head of Salomon's high-yield department,
said in a statement.
   Salomon has hired about five Drexel junk bond specialists since
the start of the year including the firm's former head of
high-yield research, Joseph C. Bencivenga, who joined Salomon about
a week ago, Field said.
   Drexel was the biggest underwriter and market maker of junk
bonds and fostered the explosive growth of junk in the 1980s into a
$225 billion market.
   The firm is liquidating as a result of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing by its parent in February.
   Drexel has whittled its securities portfolio down from about $47
billion to a little under $1 billion _ mostly junk bonds, private
placements of high-yield debt and equity stakes in companies the
firm helped finance, said Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman.
   The firm is trying to sell its portfolio in an orderly fashion
to obtain the best prices and doesn't have a target date for
finishing the job, Anreder said.
   ``We'd like to do it as expeditiously as possible but we're not
going to give it away, either,'' he said.
   There are 700 to 800 people still working at Drexel, and that
number should be cut in half within the next month or two, Anreder
said. The firm employed 5,380 workers before its bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Most Crop Futures Slide; Late Selloff In Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of grain and soybeans closed
mostly lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Wheat fell late
on speculative selling possibly linked to expectations the
government will raise its wheat stockpile figure.
   In a pair of reports scheduled for release after Tuesday's
close, the Agriculture Department will revise its estimates for
U.S. grain stocks and issue production estimates for a number of
crops other than grains.
   Steve Freed, a grains analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said the USDA is likely to increase its estimates for the wheat and
corn stockpiles and lower its soybean stocks figure.
   Wheat futures fell rapidly in the last half-hour of trading
after advancing earlier in the session on news the Soviet Union had
bid for 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Soybean futures closed mostly lower following forecasts for a
rainy week in the Midwestern soybean country. Corn ended nearly
unchanged.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1} cents to 4} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in May at $3.60{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to { cent higher with May at $2.69\ a bushel;
oats were 1} cents to 2 cents lower with May at $1.49} a bushel;
soybeans were 3{ cents lower to 2 cents higher with May at $5.92 a

<HEAD>Heinz Plans Ketchup Bottle Made of More Easily Recycled Plastic</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heinz ketchup will be packaged next year in
clear plastic bottles that the food giant says can be recycled more
readily than the squeezable containers it introduced in 1983, the
company said Monday.
   H.J. Heinz Co. officials said they hoped the new plastic
technology for their ketchup bottles would reduce the flow of
plastic into landfills and boost the company's already dominant
share of the $600 million ketchup market.
   But some environmental activists said many areas of the country
are not gathering and recycling plastic containers and said they
feared many of the new bottles would end up in the landfill anyway.
   Heinz officials said they planned an educational effort over the
next year in conjunction with the U.S. Conference of Mayors to
encourage development of recycling programs and awareness that its
containers will be recyclable.
   Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive of
Pittsburgh-based Heinz, told a news conference that solid waste
disposal issue leaves food manufacturers with both their ``biggest
problem and biggest opportunity'' in the 1990s.
   Heinz introduced the first squeezable plastic ketchup bottles in
1983, and now sells about 60 percent of its ketchup in such
containers.
   But O'Reilly said the cloudy plastic containers are
``technically recyclable,'' but no economical system has been
developed for collecting and cleaning them and making use of the
resins.
   Over the past several years, Heinz has been working on a
container made chiefly of a plastic, widely used for soft drinks,
that could keep ketchup fresh. The plastic is called polyethylene
terephthalate or PET.
   The new Enviropet ketchup bottle, which was created by
Continental PET Technologies Inc., a division of Continental Can
Co. Inc., should start showing up on grocery store counters at this
time next year, the companies said.
   The problem with the original plastic bottle, according to Corby
Mathisen, manager for plastics technology at Heinz's domestic
division, was that it consisted of five layers bound by an adhesive
and could not economically be broken down for use in other products.
   But the new bottle contains no adhesives and an industry is
already in operation using PET plastics for a variety of products
ranging from carpeting to tennis ball felt, sleeping bag fiberfill
and paint brush bristles.
   He said more than 300 towns already have curbside collection
programs for PET containers, and said 20 percent of all PET
products are recycled.
   O'Reilly said the new containers are more expensive to produce
but the added cost will not be passed on to consumers. He said the
company will make up the difference through reducing costs of other
ingredients or selling more ketchup.
   He said Heinz has more than 51 percent of the $600 million a
year ketchup market, up from 45 percent to 46 percent when it
introduced the plastic ketchup bottle in 1983.
   The company plans eventually to introduce the new packaging
technology for its other condiments and sauces.
   Allen Hershkowitz, senior scientist for the Natural Resources
Defense Council, an environmental advocacy and research
organization, said the new containers were a step in the right
direction. But he said the recycling industry is ill-equipped to
handle the flood of new containers.
   ``Of the 200 million of these bottles that will be sold next
year, it is likely that the overwhelming majority of them will be
dumped in a landfill or incinerated,'' he said.
   The Heinz bottles displayed at Monday's news conference carried
the word ``Recyclable!'' on the label.
   Hershkowitz said the use of that term likely would draw
objections if the recycling capacity for handling PET bottles was
not expanded substantially by next year.
   But Mathisen said a healthy portion of PET products are recycled
and consumers should be told when a container can be recycled. He
also said he had begun talks with appropriate regulatory
authorities on the labeling issue.

   The stock market was little changed in slow
trading today, getting off to a sluggish start on a new week.
   Japanese stocks rallied sharply today, rebounding from their
drop of more than 25 percent since the start of the year. The
Nikkei index of 225 Japanese issues soared nearly 4 percent.
   But little of that bargain-hunting enthusiasm was transmitted to
the U.S. market.
   Brokers noted that many observers had regarded the selloff in
Tokyo as largely an isolated phenomenon, reflecting forces within
the market there.
   Since the American markets did not share much in Tokyo's
malaise, analysts said, it stood to reason that they would also not
play much of a part in the recovery.
   In addition, observers said traders were reluctant to bid for
stocks just ahead of the first-quarter earnings reports due out
over the next few weeks, which are expected to show the effects of
continued weakness in economic growth.

   The dollar ended modestly lower Monday against
all major currencies except the Japanese yen and British pound,
following a wave of selling by several central banks overseas to
help prop up the yen.
   Gold prices declined in the United States and abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $376 a troy ounce, down $4.70 from late Friday.
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$375.65 an ounce, off $4.85.
   Currency dealers said several central banks, including the
Federal Reserve, sold dollars in Europe and Asia in an attempt to
stem the yen's decline.
   But they said it did little to help the Japanese currency
because the market did not believe the major industrial nations
known as the Group of Seven nations were totally committed to
supporting it.
   The yen has weakened in recent weeks amid increasing signs of a
weakening Japanese economy, helping worsen a sharp decline on the
Tokyo stock market.
   The finance ministers of the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada agreed at their meeting Saturday
in Paris that the yen's recent slide could have ``undesirable
consequences.''However, they only said they would keep developments
under review.
   The absence of Fed intervention until late European dealings
also helped underpin the dollar, dealers said.
   ``One does not get any sense of a dramatic or large-scale type
of intervention that would shock the market,'' said Trevor
Woodland, chief corporate trader for Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
``The market is generally trying to test the waters.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.02 yen to 156.45 yen Monday. It
rebounded to 157.28 yen in London and traded at 158.335 yen in New
York, up from 157.70 yen late Friday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling rose to
$1.6397 from $1.6385 in London, but fell to $1.63445 from $1.6425
in New York from Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday
quotes, included: 1.6935 West German marks, down from 1.6942;
1.4982 Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 5.6845 French francs, down
from 5.6985; 1,243.00 Italian lire, down from 1,245.25; and 1.1616
Canadian dollar, down from 1.16475.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's late rates
included: 1.6923 German marks, down from 1.6941; 1.4960 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4992; 5.6805 French francs, down from 5.6942;
1.9043 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9070; 1,242.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,245.50; and 1.1615 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1652.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $375.50 a troy ounce from
$378 Friday. In Zurich, gold fell to $376.25 an ounce from $378
late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.92 to close at $379.13 a
troy ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for April delivery settled at $5.104 a troy ounce, down from
Friday's $5.164. Silver rose one cent in London to $5.14 an ounce.

<HEAD>Miller to Expand Sales of Low-Cal Genuine Draft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. announced Monday it would
expand sales of its new, low-calorie Genuine Draft Light beer into
10 states and end testing of a ``genuine draft'' version of its
popular Miller Lite brand.
   Genuine Draft Light, which capitalizes on the success of
Miller's fast-growing regular Genuine Draft brand, was introduced
in several test markets last July.
   Milwaukee-based Miller said the beer, which is brewed in
Milwaukee and Irwindale, Calif., now will be sold statewide in
Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada,
Oregon, Utah and Washington.
   It also will continue being offered in selected markets in
Wisconsin, Texas, Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio, the brewer said.
   Genuine Draft Light's introduction pitted it against another new
product, Lite Genuine Draft. That test brand was an extension of
the popular Miller Lite, the second best-selling beer in the United
States.
   The announcement Monday means Genuine Draft won and testing of
Lite Genuine Draft will end.
   Genuine Draft, which like regular draft beer is brewed without
pasteurization, became the 10th best-selling beer in the United
States last year, displacing Anheuser-Busch Inc.'s Michelob brand.
   A 12-ounced serving of the new light version of Genuine Draft
has about 98 calories, about a third less than regular beer, Miller
said.

   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled 101,000
of its 1986-model Aerostar minivans because of the chance of a fuel
leak.
   The company said leaks can occur at the seal between the fuel
tank and the fuel-filler pipe when the tank is full or nearly full.
Ford said it was aware of no fires caused by the leak.
   The vehicles recalled are about two-thirds of all 1986 Aerostars

spokesman Jim Trainor said.
   Owners are being notified by mail. Repairs will be performed for

<TEXT>
   General Development Corp. further trimmed its work
force Monday as the troubled real estate company considered
expanding its bankruptcy filing to include subsidiaries.
   Miami-based General Development, which pleaded guilty last month
to a scheme to sell overpriced homes, laid off 239 workers involved
in construction at some of its nine Florida communities, spokesman
Otis Wragg III said.
   Last week, General Development closed all home-site sales
offices and broker bureaus around the world and laid off about
1,100 employees.
   Meanwhile, an attorney for the company told a bankruptcy judge
Sunday that some of General Development's three subsidiaries may
join the parent company in bankruptcy court.
   But attorney Brian Gart did not indicate which segments of
General Development could seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   The filing last week did not affect General Development's
Vistana Resort and Glen Ivy subsidiaries, which operate time-share
developments near Disney World and in the West. The company's other
subsidiary, General Development Utilities Inc., also was not named
in the filing.
   Gart represented the company at an emergency hearing before U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge A. Jay Cristol, who ordered that General
Development must honor all paychecks issued before Friday's
bankrupcty filing. The company listed assets of $860 million and
liabilities of $830 million.
   General Development, however, has not indicated how the action
may affect a proposed $100 million restitution plan for about
10,000 victims of a scheme to sell overpriced homes.
   But Gart said he is ``almost certain'' the bankrupcty filing was
not linked to the restitution plan, which is being reviewed by a
court-appointed master.
   Cristol said he would appoint a special trustee to respresent
about 100,000 home-site buyers, presently are not listed as
creditors.
   General Development stock closed Monday down 37{ cents at $1.87{
in New York Stock Exchange trading.

   The chairmen of General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. took sharp pay cuts in 1989 during an auto industry
slump, but still received more than $9 million between them, the
companies said Monday.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen received $6.6 million in salary,
bonuses and stock options last year, down from $10.5 million in
1988, the No. 2 automaker said in its annual proxy statement.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith was paid $2.5 million, down from $3.6
million the previous year, the proxy for the world's largest
automaker revealed.
   The payouts were the last for a full year for the two
executives. Petersen retired March 1 as Ford's chairman and chief
executive, while Smith retires at the end of July.
   The United Auto Workers union called the payments ``a disease
that's still in need of a cure.''
   ``The auto industry has real and pressing problems, but the
companies signal only arrogance and business-as-usual attitudes
through these excessive payments to senior executives,'' UAW
President Owen Bieber and the union's GM and Ford department heads
said in a statement.
   GM President Robert Stempel, who takes over Aug. 1 as chairman,
received $1.8 million in compensation last year. More than half of
Smith's and Stempel's compensation were in stock options.
   Ford's new chairman, Harold Poling, received $2.9 million for
1989, about $2.1 million in salary and bonuses and the rest in
stock options.
   Chrysler Corp. on Friday is expected to release its proxy
statement, which details executive compensation and other
information prior to annual shareholders' meetings.
   The auto industry is mired in a slump reflected by 1989 profits,
when Big Three earnings fell 25 percent from 1988. GM profits
declined 13 percent to $4.22 billion, Ford's dropped 28 percent to
$3.84 billion and Chrysler's tumbled 66 percent to $359 million.
   Ford's proxy statement showed that Petersen received $3.1
million in salary and bonuses and $3.5 million on stock options
last year.
   His 1989 compensation was 37 percent less than in 1988, when he
was the auto industry's top-paid executive. At GM, Smith's earnings
declined about 31 percent.
   Three other officers listed separately in Ford's proxy,
President Philip Benton and executive vice presidents Allan Gilmour
and Louis Ross, received more than $1.7 million apiece.
   Collectively, Ford awarded about $214 million to 5,286 Ford
executives in bonuses for the company's performance in 1989.
   According to a formula, Ford could have distributed $229 million
in bonuses. The board reduced that, leaving $1.3 million in the
bonus pool for 1990 and transferring $14.4 million into general
operating coffers.
   About 150,000 hourly Ford workers last month received
profit-sharing checks of about $1,025 each. GM paid an average of
$50 to about 443,000 employees.
   Ford's proxy statement, which also includes a slate of 17 board
of directors candidates, was sent to the company's 287,000
shareholders before the company's annual meeting in Detroit on May
10.
   GM's proxy went to more than 1 million shareholders, officially
notifying them of the annual meeting May 25 in Detroit.
   GM's proxy statement also included a proposal to boost to 500
million the number of shares of Class E common stock the company
would be authorized to issue.
   About 91 million shares are oustanding of Class E shares, which
are linked to GM's Electronics Data Systems Corp. subsidiary.
   GM said the authorization to issue new Class E shares is needed
``to provided flexibility for possible future actions such as
additional stock dividends, splits or acquisitions.''
   The company said it had no plans to issue more Class E stock now.

<TEXT>
   The former chief auditor of Lincoln Savings
and Loan, who later earned more than $900,000 a year working for
Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr., has refused to testify in
Keating's suit to reclaim the seized thrift, a government lawyer
said Monday.
   James Murphy, an attorney defending the federal takeover of the
$5.5 billion Irvine, Calif., S&amp;L a year ago, said accountant Jack
D. Atchison filed an affidavit invoking his Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination.
   Atchison is the fifth former Keating employee or business
associate to invoke the Fifth Amendment in refusing to testify on
Keating's suit, which accuses the government of ``arbitrarily and
capriciously'' seizing Lincoln.
   Murphy said he wanted to question Atchison about a tax-sharing
arrangement between Lincoln and its holding company, American
Continental Corp., and a June 1988 decision by ACC to bolster the
thrift's capital by $10 million under regulatory pressure.
   He asked U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin to consider
Atchison's refusal to testify as a ``negative inference'' in
Keating's civil suit.
   Keating lawyer John Lundin said Atchinson didn't want to testify
amid a ``tremendous swirl'' of criminal investigations under way in
the Lincoln case.
   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles is weighing possible
criminal charges against Keating, the chairman of American
Continental, and several other Lincoln and ACC officials.
   As the largest S&amp;L collapse in history, regulators estimate that
risky land investments directed by Keating using federally insured
deposits could cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   Regulators have sued Keating, alleging that he and nearly a
dozen associates engaged in widespread illegal acts of fraud and
racketeering in their operation of Lincoln from the time Keating
bought it in February 1984.
   Formerly the managing partner in the Phoenix office of
accounting firm Arthur Young _ now Ernst &amp; Young _ Atchison was the
chief author of audit reports on Lincoln later cited by five U.S.
senators defending their intervention on Keating's behalf with
federal regulators in 1987.
   Atchison, who left Arthur Young to work for Keating at an annual
salary above $900,000, also refused last fall to testify before the
House Banking Committee. He now works as a private consultant.
   Keating, meanwhile, testified Monday that he ordered American
Continental to buy $10 million of preferred stock from Lincoln on
June 30, 1988, as part of a ``memorandum of understanding'' with
regulators calling for an infusion of new capital to support the
thrift's risky investments.
   Although he said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board gave an Oct. 1
deadline for the $10 million capital infusion, Keating said he came
up with the money three months early ``to show our good will''
toward ending a long-running feud with regulators.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Monday its
first-quarter profit fell 87.6 percent from a year earlier, when
its results included a huge one-time gain on the sale of its
investment in a cable-system operator.
   Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine, said it earned $24.9 million, or 25 cents a share, in the
three months ended March 31 compared with $200 million, or $1.99 a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose 5 percent to $427.1 million from $406.8 million in
1989.
   The 1989 results included an after-tax gain of $164.1 million,
or $1.63 a share, on the cable investment sale. Excluding the gain,
its net income was down 30.6 percent in the latest quarter.
Operating income fell 22.2 percent.
   The company said income from its business publications rose 20.2
percent, but that its income fell 34.6 percent from information
services, mainly because of losses associated with the introduction
of a foreign-exchange trading service by its Telerate Inc.
subsidiary.
   The trading service had not been in operation in the first
quarter of 1989.
   The latest results were also hurt by a decline in operating
income at the community newspaper segment, a higher effective tax
rate and increased interest expense and goodwill amortization
related to Dow Jones' January acquisition of the one-third stake in
Telerate that it did not already own.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to $184.3 million at the information
services segment, which includes Telerate, Dow Jones News Service
and Dow Jones News-Retrieval service. But operating income fell to
$35.8 million from $54.6 million.
   Revenue rose 3.5 percent to $189.3 million at the business
publications, while operating income rose to $26.2 million from
$21.9 million.
   Advertising linage fell 3.9 percent at The Wall Street Journal,
while it rose 2.1 percent at the weekly Barron's.
   Revenue fell 2.5 percent to $53.4 million at Ottaway Newspapers
Inc. while operating income at the community newspaper segment fell
39.3 percent to $4.5 million.

<HEAD>Petroleum Industry Adopts `Guiding Environmental Principles'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: CORRECTS `principals' to `principles' in first and last
grafs; Also moved on general newswires</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major petroleum companies have
adopted a set of ``guiding environmental principles,'' their trade
association announced Monday.
   But a senior attorney for an environmental organization said the
11 principles adopted Friday in Dallas by the American Petroleum
Institute sound instead like hollow promises.
   ``The commitments are so vague as to be practically
meaningless,'' said Bob Adler of the Natural Resources Defense
Council.
   The American Petroleum Institute's board of directors, which
includes all of the nation's major petroleum companies, adopted the
environmental principles in a unanimous vote.
   Those principles include pledges to promote the safe use,
transportation and disposal of raw materials; to address problems
created by the handling and disposal of hazardous substances from
oil operations; and to operate plants and facilities in a way that
protects the environment as well as the safety and health of
employees and the public.
   ``It sounds like hollow promises, especially coming from an
industry that has violated not only government regulations but its
own promises time and time again,'' Adler said.
   Adler said the industry appears to be seeking to replace ``badly
needed'' enforceable government regulations with more unenforceable
industry promises.
   ``This industry has said `trust me' many times in past but has
proven as many times in the past that they cannot be trusted on
their own,'' Adler said.
   The API's environmental principles were adopted within days of
the first anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill, in which the
tanker Exxon Valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of toxic crude
oil into the sea when it ran aground in Prince William Sound,
Alaska.
   The proposals also come as a House-Senate conference committee
considers oil spill liability legislation that Adler said would
increase liability standards for oil spills, impose a bigger tax to
finance a cleanup fund, and require better clean-up plans. The
House-passed version of the bill would require double hulls and
bottoms on tankers.
   The oil industry also is seeking to drill in such restricted
areas as Bristol Bay in Alaska, off the Florida Keys and the
California coast, and at the Arctic National Wildife Refuge.
   The industry, Adler said, ``is facing increasing opposition to
those drilling plans in light of their recent record. Maybe they're
trying to assure Congress and the public they can drill safely.''
   API Board Chairman Allen E. Murray said the industry understands
public concern about the environment.
   ``At the same time, we firmly believe that the nation can have
both environmental protection and economic growth,'' said Murray,
who is chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer
of Mobil Corp.
   A preamble to the environmental principles declares that API
members are ``dedicated to continuous efforts to improve the
compatibility of our operations with the environment while
economically developing energy resources and supplying high quality
products and services to consumers.''

<HEAD>New Scratch-Ticket Game Off to Good Start</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The name of Washington's newest lottery
game may have offended some securities industry insiders, but
``Wall Street'' got off to a good start Monday, state officials
said.
   ``This is official Day One, and from what we can tell so far,
it's going very well,'' said Terry Massoth, telemarketing
supervisor for the Washington State Lottery.
   The state began distributing ``Wall Street'' scratch tickets
Monday and some lottery outlets already have placed a second round
of orders, Massoth said.
   Players scratch across rows of boxes on the $1 tickets to reveal
amounts under ``Buy,'' ``Sell'' and ``Profit.'' If the sell number
is higher than the buy number in the same row, the player wins the
profit.
   Prizes range from $1 to $10,000. The relatively large size of
the top prize likely accounts for the new game's popularity,
Massoth said.
   ``The `Wall Street' game offers advantages not found in trading
on that New York City street,'' lottery Director Evelyn Sun said in
a pre-startup statement. Players ``cannot lose more than they
invested,'' she said.
   Some strategists on the real Wall Street were offended by the
pitch.
   ``It's only players who speculate and don't know what they're
doing who get killed or sucked in by the market,'' said Yale Hirsch
in New York, a prominent investment adviser who publishes the Stock
Trader's Almanac.
   Massoth laughed when told that the name of the new game had
aroused indignation in stock-market circles.
   ``They don't feel that's gambling, huh?'' he said, noting that
stock market fluctuations sometimes are attributed to such
non-financial events as the outcome of the Super Bowl.
   ``That's real science,'' he said.

   The committee representing Eastern Airlines'
preferred shareholders proposed a reorganization plan for the
carrier Monday that would give Eastern to its shareholders, other
creditors and new managers.
   The move marks the first time one of the parties in Eastern's
bankruptcy proceeding has challenged the airline's reorganization
plan by submitting its own proposal.
   Miami-based Eastern has submitted several restructuring plans
since its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on March 9, 1989. Its
exclusive right to file a plan with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
expired Feb. 20 after the court extended it several times.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak in Miami said the airline
hadn't yet seen the shareholders' proposal and declined comment. So
did Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's unsecured creditors,
the other major group that is owed money.
   The preferred shareholders' committee said it filed with the
court a plan to reorganize Eastern as an ``independent,
stand-alone'' airline that would be owned by shareholders and
unsecured creditors and operated by a new management team.
   The shareholders' committee had objected previously to Eastern's
plan that would have paid them only 10 cents on the dollar.
   The preferred holders, whom Eastern owes about $680 million,
would own 45 percent of the new airline under the plan. The
unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million, would get 50
percent of Eastern. The remaining 5 percent would be held by the
new management team.
   Robert Miller, an attorney for the preferred shareholders, said
the committee has spoken to ``several people'' as possible new
managers of Eastern, but he refused to identify them.
   Eastern's unions, which struck the airline on March 4, 1989,
long have advocated that Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp., be replaced in running Eastern by a special
court-appointed trustee. The unsecured creditors, unhappy with
Eastern's proposals to repay them only partially, indicated last
week they also would seek a trustee.
   Under the preferred holders' plan, the unsecured creditors also
would receive $200 million in new, collateralized Eastern bonds and
$50 million in cash. They would get another $70 million in notes to
be repaid from funds Eastern might win in litigation against its
parent Texas Air and its sister Continental Airlines over Eastern
assets transferred to them before the strike and bankruptcy.
   The unsecured creditors include such aircraft manufacturers as
Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie and jet engine makers like General
Electric Co.
   Court-appointed bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro recently
found that Texas Air owes Eastern between $280 million and $400
million for the difference between what it paid for the assets and
what they were worth. Houston-based Texas Air has offered to settle
the potential claims by paying Eastern around $280 million, but the
unions have said that is insufficient and a trustee should be
appointed.
   If the $70 million in notes were repaid, the rest of the money
from the litigation would be invested in the new airline's
operations, Miller said.
   He said the preferred holders have discussed their new plan with
representatives of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., financial advisers to the
unsecured creditors.
   ``We would hope that (the unsecured creditors) would be
supportive of a reorganization rather than a liquidation,'' Miller
said in a telephone interview. ``We don't want to see this airline
liquidated.''
   Last Tuesday, the committee of unsecured creditors voted
unanimously to reject Eastern's latest reorganization proposal,
which would give them only 25 cents for each dollar owed. A
majority of the creditors also voted to seek the appointment of a
special trustee.
   However, the unsecured creditors dropped an earlier threat to
press for a liquidation of Eastern, because they were concerned
about the potentially negative impact of such a request on
passenger bookings.

<TEXT>
   Learjet Corp., the maker of small business
jets favored by corporate executives, will be sold to Canada's
Bombardier Inc. for $75 million under an agreement announced Monday.
   The deal must be approved by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in
New York. Learjet's parent, Integrated Resources Inc., filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February after defaulting on
debt payments.
   In addition to the purchase price, a newly formed Bombardier
subsidiary will assume liabilities associated with Learjet's
continuing operations, including loans outstanding under the
company's $38 million line of credit.
   Montreal-based Bombardier designs and manufactures
transportation equipment and motorized consumer products. It also
has interests in civilian and military aerospace.
   Learjet spokesman Bill Robinson said the deal amounts to $15
million more than the last bidder had offered.
   Learjet was founded by Bill Lear in the late 1950s to
manufacture business jets. It currently makes three light jets and
a medium class model selling for $3.8 million to $7.2 million.
   Learjet employs 2,750 people company-wide and has annual sales
in excess of $250 million. It was acquired by Integrated in 1987.
   Bombardier's products include rail transit equipment,
snowmobiles and a heavy business jet called Challenger jet, which
is manufactured by its Canadair Group and sells for $14 million to
$18 million.
   The company has plants in Canada, the United States, Austria,
Belgium, France, England, Finland and Sweden, and employs 22,500
people. Bombardier's annual business volume is more than $2 billion
Canadian.
   Bombardier plans to keep Learjet's current operations in Wichita
and allow present management to operate the business, Robinson said.
   In late February, another group that tentatively had agreed to
buy Learjet for $60 million let its offer lapse. The group said at
the time that the bankruptcy filing by Integrated could hamper the
deal.
   Learjet officials said other potential buyers had written the
bankruptcy court expressing an interest in buying the company for
more than $60 million. Bombardier confirmed it was one of those
companies.
   ``We are in the process of selling a significant number of
assets prior to presenting our restructuring program to our
creditors,'' said Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   He said the Learjet sale will be the first major asset
disposition outside Integrated's former core businesses.
   Integrated began as a real estate company and expanded rapidly
several years to become the largest seller of tax-sheltered
investments.
   But the tax-shelter business was scuttled by the 1986 tax-law
revisions, so Integrated moved into insurance and mutual funds,
financed largely through junk bonds.

<HEAD>CBS Gets First-Run Rights to 10 Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS said Monday it acquired rights to 10
Universal Pictures 1989 films, including ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' and ``Field of Dreams,'' bypassing a decade-old practice of
selling first to cable TV.
   The movies will be shown during the 1990-91 television season,
CBS said.
   The deal follows complaints by MCA Inc. that its movies have
been shut out of the pay television market dominated by Time Warner
Inc., which owns both the Home Box Office and Cinemax pay TV
networks and the Warner Bros. film studio.
   It also culminates a search by MCA's Universal Pictures unit for
an outlet for popular films that failed to attract strong bids from
either HBO or Viacom Inc.'s Showtime and The Movie Channel units.
   ``CBS is pleased to bring the big event of feature film
television premieres back to network television, where all of the
public will have the opportunity to see them,'' CBS Entertainment
President Jeff Sagansky said.
   Cable channels were not ``disposed to come forth and make a deal
that was in any way viable,'' MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg
said. ``CBS and Jeff Sagansky have shown that they are completely
committed to attracting viewers back to network television.''
   Terms of the deal were not announced by CBS or MCA, but the
network is believed to have paid between $6 million and $8 million
per film.
   The Universal films will move directly from videocassette sales
to CBS.
   For the past decade, rights to feature films have been sold
first for video distribution, then for cable broadcast and then to
the three networks.
   The pact could foreshadow changes in the way the major movie
studios and the networks do business with one another, analysts
said.
   ``I fully expect that the networks will be bidding heavily with
pay TV for movie rights in the next few years,'' said Steven
Rosenberg, head of Rose Media Corp. of Pebble Beach, Calif.
   Earlier this year, MCA general counsel Robert Hadl told a
Federal Communications Commission hearing that HBO had not been
interested in buying Universal's films since Time Inc., HBO's
parent, acquired Warner Communications, parent of Warner Bros.,
last year.
   The movie package includes Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'';
``Sea of Love,'' with Al Pacino; ``Uncle Buck,'' with John Candy;
``K-9,'' starring Jim Belushi; as well as ``Field of Dreams'' and
``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   Also included are ``Fletch Lives,'' ``Renegades,'' ``Shocker''
and ``The Wizard.''
   CBS also will have broadcast rights to several Universal films
to be shown on pay cable. They include ``Parenthood,'' ``The Dream
Team'' and ``The 'burbs.''

markets under an agreement announced Monday with Turner
Broadcasting System Inc.
   The 10-year deal, announced by TBS Chairman Ted Turner and
Tribune President James C. Dowdle, also includes joint production
of news, documentary specials and entertainment programs.
   As part of the agreement, Tribune will end ``USA Tonight'' and
its IDNX news service. Six Tribune stations will become affiliates

non-exclusive basis.
   Those stations are WPIX in New York, KTLA in Los Angeles, WGN in
Chicago, WGNX in Atlanta, KWGN in Denver and WGNO in New Orleans.
   The stations will use the CNN coverage to expand their evening
newscasts to one hour this summer, Tribune officials said in a
statement. ``USA Tonight'' and IDNX will be discontinued in June,
Dowdle said.
   ``We're delighted to bring Turner Broadcasting's worldwide
news-gathering capabilities to the Tribune newscasts and are very
optimistic about the future entertainment program undertakings,''
Dowdle said.
   ``We have worked with Tribune Broadcasting Company over the
years with very positive results,'' Turner said. ``We are convinced
that the extension of this relationship will result in a
significant programming venture.''
   The two companies also will work together to produce quarterly
news specials and original entertainment programming. Tentative
plans include production of two mini-series per year for broadcast
on Tribune stations, Atlanta television station TBS and in general
syndication.
   The entertainment programs will be distributed worldwide by
Turner Program Services while Tribune Entertainment Company will
handle advertising sales.

   California insurance regulators Monday
rejected a French takeover of the Farmers insurance companies,
jeopardizing the proposed $21 billion hostile buyout of Britain's
BAT Industries PLC.
   BAT owns Farmers Group Inc., and bidder Sir James Goldsmith had
proposed to sell Farmers to Axa-Midi Assurances of France upon
acquiring BAT, Britain's biggest conglomerate.
   California regulators ruled that policyholders' interests would
not be served either by a takeover of BAT by Goldsmith's Hoylake
Investments Ltd. or the sale of Farmers to the French company. A
key objection was that Axa-Midi was putting no cash behind its $4.5
billion offer.
   Axa-Midi Chairman Claude Bebear had agreed to give Goldsmith $1
billion to help with the BAT purchase.
   To buy Farmers, Axa-Midi was to borrow $2.25 billion from banks
and $2.25 billion from Goldsmith by giving him promissory notes.
Goldsmith then was to sell the notes for cash.
   ``While Axa-Midi has an outstanding European record, the
leverage of this deal is such that it would endanger the Farmers
group of insurance companies,'' Insurance Commissioner Roxani
Gillespie said in a statement issued by her department.
   The department said Axa-Midi ``basically looked to the financial
performance of the Farmers companies to repay the acquisition
debt.''
   ``However, insurance companies cannot be relied upon to repay
this type of sizable debt as it would be dangerous to policyholders
and claimants,'' the statement said.
   Axa-Midi spokesman Eliot Sloane said Bebear believed the deal
could be restructured to win approval from Ms. Gillespie. ``They're
raising the issue of leverage and we think we can address that and
correct it,'' he said.
   Bebear issued a statement saying the Insurance Department's
reservations about Axa-Midi's financing were within reason and
Axa-Midi would press ahead in attempts to address them and win
regulatory approval.
   The statement did not say how Axa-Midi intended to put more cash
into the deal. Its officials have suggested in the past that it
might do so by issuing stock, selling non-insurance assets, or
restructuring the deal with Goldsmith.
   Lorraine Johnson, senior staff counsel to the Insurance
Department, said Axa-Midi could fight the ruling by asking a
Superior Court judge to order the department to reconsider, or by
making a new proposal.
   She noted the department had ruled that Axa-Midi had failed to
meet three of five test standards and Hoylake had failed four of
the five tests.
   The problems with the proposal primarily deal with how the deal
would be financed, including the collapse of the junk-bond market
and banks' recent difficulty in providing bridge loans.
   Ms. Johnson also said Goldsmith never has formally presented his
latest offer for BAT since withdrawing an earlier one. ``There is
no offer there for us to look at,'' she said.
   She said Bebear had suggested earlier that he could sell assets
or stock to raise cash, but too vaguely to persuade state officials.
   Farmers, the third largest U.S. auto and homeowner insurer, had
maintained that Axa-Midi was too small to take over Farmers.
   ``The commissioner's decision to deny the applications ...
recognizes that the proposed takeover of Farmers would have placed
policyholders at significant risk,'' Farmers Group chairman and
chief executive Leo E. Denlea Jr. said.
   In order for Goldsmith to proceed with his bid for BAT, the
British Takeover Panel has said he must gain clearance for his
plans for Farmers in each of the nine states in which Farmers
operates an insurance company.
   Illinois, Idaho, Oregon and Washington also have held hearings
on the proposed takeover but have not announced decisions. Hearings
began Monday in Texas. Insurance departments in Arizona, Kansas and
Ohio have yet to set hearing dates.

enterprises continued to expand, while state-run enterprises showed
declining output and productivity.
   Industrial output for March was up 1.4 percent compared to the
same month in 1989. Output in state enterprises was the same as
last year, while collectives showed 0.7 percent growth, township
enterprises 5.4 percent and others, mainly small private firms,
32.3 percent.
   For the first quarter, the industrial output value of
state-owned enterprises fell 1.1 percent to 285.5 billion yuan
($60.7 billion) and collectives were down 1.4 percent to 111.6
billion yuan ($23.7 billion).
   Township enterprises, however, were up 3.5 percent, and others
by 30.4 percent.
   Combined industrial output in the first quarter was 415.8
billion yuan ($88.5 billion), the same as in 1989.
   Tough austerity measures aimed at curbing inflation and
unsustainable economic growth brought industrial output growth down
to 8.3 percent last year from 21 percent in 1988.
   But in the past six months, thousands of factories have closed
down or reduced production because tight money policies have
deprived them of funds and the suspension of capital investment
projects have left them without work.
   Through February, industrial output was down 0.9 percent
compared to the same period last year, the Statistical Bureau
report said.
   The government, concerned about rising unemployment and the
threat of recession, has begun pumping money back into the economy.
But the bureau warned that despite the slight recovery in March,
the industrial outlook for the coming months remained grim.
   It said productivity in state-owned enterprises during the first
two months of 1990 was down 2.3 percent.

   Time Warner Inc. has agreed to provide $650
million to help fund Pathe Communication Corp.'s purchase of MGM-UA
Communications in exchange for distribution rights to current and
future Pathe and United Artists films, it was announced Monday.
   Time Warner has been rumored for weeks to have been involved in
discussions that could lead to its providing the financial backbone
for Pathe's $1.27 billion acquisition of MGM-UA.
   Pathe made the second $50 million deposit toward the purchase
Monday, adding to last month's $50 million installment. At that
time Pathe had not said how it planned to fund the acquisition.
   Monday's joint announcement by Time Warner's Warner Bros. unit
and Pathe said the loan and other details of the deal were subject
to the completion of Pathe's purchase of MGM-UA.
   Under the deal, Warner Bros. will provide long-term support
services to Pathe and MGM-UA in exchange for worldwide theatrical,
television and home video distribution rights to existing and
future UA and Pathe films.
   Those services will include a $650 million bank loan to MGM-UA
that would be secured by the UA film library and guaranteed by Time
Warner. The money would be used by MGM-UA to purchase certain Pathe
assets, and Pathe would in turn use the money to buy MGM-UA.
   ``This agreement represents a major step for Pathe towards
implementing its plans to create an international, major
entertainment company,'' Giancarlo Parretti, Pathe's president, and
Yoram Globus, the company's co-president, said in a joint statement.
   ``We are gratified that Pathe has chosen the worldwide
distribution and marketing team at Warner Bros. to support its
product,'' Warner Bros. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert A. Daly
and President and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel said in their
joint statement.

<HEAD>Court: Insurers Liable for $960 Million in Claims Against
Owens-Illinois</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insurance companies are liable for $960 million
in damage and injury claims against Owens-Illinois Inc. arising
from the use of its products containing asbestos, a New Jersey
court has ruled.
   The ruling is believed to be one of the largest surrounding the
issue of who is liable for claims that asbestos made people ill,
The New York Times said in its Tuesday editions.
   New Jersey Superior Court Judge Erminie Conly on Friday issued a
finding of liability against five insurance companies: Allstate,
Cigna Reinsurance, General Reinsurance, United Insurance and
American Risk Management.
   The case relates to industrial insulating materials the Toledo,
Ohio, company made between 1948 and 1958 that contained 15 percent
asbestos, said Andrew Berry, who represented Owens-Illinois.
   As a result of the production, Owens-Illinois is a defendant in
thousands of cases brought on behalf of individuals and property
owners who contend they have been made ill by the materials, the
Times reported.
   ``This is the latest and biggest of a series of decisions over
the last decade,'' Berry said.
   David D'Aloia, who represented Allstate and United Insurance,
said an appeal was under consideration.
   The ruling appeared to be a setback for the insurance industry,
which had recently been on a winning streak in liability cases, the
Times said.
   Companies that produced material with asbestos have been
wrangling with their insurance companies for more than a decade
over whether the insurance covers death and illness claims arising
from long-term asbestos exposure.
   Insurers have argued successfully in many cases that illnesses
from asbestos exposure have not been accidental events typically
covered by insurance. Instead, they have said the injuries were due
to corporate strategies that knew the health risks but continued
production.

<HEAD>To Launch Car Rental Venture in Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Corp. said Tuesday it had formed a
joint car rental venture in Japan with Hertz Corp., the world's
largest automobile rental company.
   The new Hertz Japan Ltd., with $3.16 million in capital, will be
fully integrated with Hertz's worldwide network comprising about
5,000 locations in more than 120 countries, Mazda said in a
statement.
   Hertz Japan is scheduled to start operations this summer, with
the number of rental and lease cars to be increased to 10,000
vehicles at 250 outlets across Japan by the end of 1993.
   ``This is an exciting development for Hertz on the international
front and further strengthens our global car rental leadership,''
Hertz chairman and chief executive Frank A. Olson said in the
statement.
   Hertz, based in Park Ridge, N.J., is 55 percent owned by Ford
Motor Co., while 24.2 percent of Mazda share is owned by Ford
Motor. Mazda is Japan's fourth largest automaker.
   Norimasa Furuta, president of the Hiroshima-based Mazda, said
Hertz's ``established expertise in customer service meets our own
philosophy to seek what is best for our customers.''
   The new car rental venture will be operated as a nationwide
franchise system with all vehicles purchased and owned by Hertz
Japan. The fleet will include Mazda models and other Japanese and
foreign cars, the statement said.
   Mazda spokesman Yutaka Kaita said 70 percent to 80 percent of
the total rental and lease cars in the new firm will be foreign
cars, including models such as Ford, Citroen of France and Lancia
of Italy.
   The spokesman said Mazda separately operates its own car rental
company with 13,700 Mazda models at 250 outlets in Japan, making it
the country's third largest rental firm after Toyota Motor Corp.
and Nippon Rent-A-Car Service Inc.
