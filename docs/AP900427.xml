<TEXT>
   The Connecticut Senate on Friday approved
a bill guaranteeing a woman's right to choose abortion even if the
U.S. Supreme Court overturns its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
   The bill effectively codifies into state law much of Roe vs.
Wade, making Connecticut the first state to take such action. It
now goes to Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill, who has said he
will sign it.
   ``Even if the Supreme Court were to reverse Roe v. Wade ... this
statute would be the governing standard for the state of
Connecticut,'' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the Democratic
vice-chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a co-sponsor of the
bill.
   ``I think what the Supreme Court is saying in effect to the
states ... is we're going to turn this issue over to you.
Connecticut has taken the gauntlet and said we're ready to face
that issue and we're going to be pro-choice,'' he said.
   The legislature was spurred to address the issue in part because
of last summer's Supreme Court decision in Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services of Missouri, which gave states greater latitude to
restrict abortion.
   The measure, which also repeals the state's unenforced
anti-abortion statutes, requires girls 15 and under to get
counseling before an abortion and encourages them to tell their
parents.
   Because the bill contains the counseling provisions, the
Pro-Life Council of Connecticut as well as pro-choice activists
have claimed victory with its approval.
   A similar bill approved by the New Hampshire legislature was
vetoed earlier this year by Gov. Judd Gregg, and an effort to
override the veto failed last week.
   Proponents argued the New Hampshire measure merely wrote into
state law the guidelines of Roe vs. Wade. But Judd said the measure
would have gone farther, allowing abortions until the point a
woman's doctor determined the fetus could survive outside the womb.
   The Connecticut bill, in a slight variation on the Roe vs. Wade
decision, allows abortions late in pregnancy _ when the fetus is
capable of living outside the womb _ only when the life or health
of the mother is in danger.
   ``Now that we've placed Roe vs. Wade in Connecticut's law books,
we need to fight hard to protect it,'' said Betsy Wacker of the
Connecticut branch of the National Abortion Rights Action League,
which lobbied for portions of the bill.
   A NARAL statement said last summer's Supreme Court decision
``sounded an alarm which woke up the pro-choice majority.''
   The Senate vote came after about 45 minutes of debate and was
witnessed by numerous House members, who had endured five hours of
debate on the bill last week.
   The Senate easily rejected three Republican amendments, one of
which would have restored criminal sanctions against anyone
performing an abortion and permitted the father or grandparent of
the fetus to sue for $10,000 in damages. That was rejected 31-4.
   Another amendment, rejected 27-8, would have required minors to
notify parents before an abortion could be performed. The bill as
approved requires girls 15 and under to get counseling before an
abortion; but it only encourages them to talk with their parents
beforehand.
   ``It's a sad day in the state of Connecticut when we would
intervene to deny parents' fundamental rights,'' said Sen. Thomas
Scott, Republican sponsor of the parental notification amendment.
Allowing a child to make such a decision on her own, Scott added,
``is unconscionable.''
   But Sen. Lee Scarpetti, also a Republican, said that ``all the
laws in the world won't change'' family relationships.

   Thousands of riot police firing tear
gas stormed the world's largest shipyard at dawn Saturday to expel
striking workers armed with steel pipes, propane gas tanks and
homemade cannons.
   The crushing of the strike at the Hyundai shipyard sparked a
massive street protest by thousands of workers. Militants hurled
rocks and firebombs and fought police in hand-to-hand combat.
   Two police buses were torched and burned. One armored van used
to fire tear gas was destroyed and at least 10 other police
vehicles were damaged in the fighting on streets near the shipyard.
   Major streets were closed and air flights were canceled into
Ulsan.
   Some estimates said as many as 20,000 workers were involved in
the protests, many from affiliated Hyundai companies in the Ulsan
area.
   Initial police reports said about 300 workers were arrested and
at least 20 people were injured in the storming of the shipyard.
There were no immediate casualty figures from the street fighting.
   The three-day-old strike had shut down the Hyundai Heavy
Industries Co. shipyard in this city about 200 miles southeast of
Seoul and was threatening to spread to other industries.
   Talks to try to end the strike, which centered on worker demands
to free four jailed labor leaders, had broken down hours earlier.
Authorities said the strike was illegal.
   Police bulldozers ripped down steel barricades the workers had
erected at the gates to the sprawling shipyard, and an estimated
10,000 riot police rushed in, wearing gas masks and helmets and
carrying clubs and shields.
   They were backed up by at least 10 armored vans firing clouds of
choking tear gas. At the same time, about 600 riot police stormed
the seaside complex by boat.
   A company guard inside the yard said tear gas was so dense he
could hardly see, and black smoke was billowing from several
workers' tents which had been set afire.
   About 100 workers on or around a giant 240-foot crane erected on
the docks taunted police, shouting insults and threats.
   The workers hurled firebombs, rocks and pices of metal and
combat-clad police retaliated with volleys of tear gas, witnesses
said.
   About 2,000 workers in the shipyard overnight had maintained a
vigil around blazing bonfires, said Munhwa Broadcasting Co. Many
were seen fleeing as police launched their attack.
   Before the assault began, a police helicopter hovered overhead,
dropping leaflets calling on workers to leave peacefully. Police
using loudspeakers shouted three times before storming the gates:
``Disperse, disperse, disperse!''
   Last year, about 12,000 police firing tear gas stormed the
shipyard to end a 109-day strike.
   At one point Friday, 43 busloads of riot police drove past the
shipyard's main gate as strikers jabbed their fists in the air
shouting insults.
   ``We have no choice but to fight,'' one union leader said after
a rally attended by about 10,000 workers.
   Steel ladders and other iron fixtures and parts were piled at
the main gate to create a 9-foot-high wall. Hundreds of workers
wearing helmets and armed with steel pipes patrolled the shipyard
in small groups.
   Gas and power supplies to the shipyard were cut and about 4,000
management workers withdrawn after last-minute negotiations between
union leaders and company executives broke down Thursday night.
   About 20,000 of the shipyard's 24,000 employees are unionized.
According to the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Association, the
Hyundai shipyard is the world's largest, capable of building 14
large ships simultaneously. Sales last year totaled $1.5 billion.
   Workers are demanding the release of four labor leaders arrested
in earlier protests that were deemed illegal. The company maintains
that judicial matters are out of its domain.
   Government officials say the strikes are illegal because workers
have not gone through the required legal steps, including a
cooling-off period. Union leaders say the complexity of labor laws
makes it virtually impossible to stage a legal strike.
   Hyundai has 32 subsidiaries in Ulsan, including the shipyard,
and union leaders issued a joint statement saying workers at all
Hyundai companies would begin a general strike if police moved into
the yard.
   In Seoul, radical students hurled firebombs at four showrooms of
Hyundai Motor Co., a sister firm of the Hyundai shipyard. No one
was hurt, but several windows wee broken, police said.
   Radical students held anti-government rallies Friday on two
campuses in Seoul and burned an effigy of Jung Joo-yong, chairman
of the Hyundai group, vowing to support striking workers.
   Also in Seoul, workers of the state-run Korea Broadcasting
System staged sit-in protests for the 16th day Friday to demand the
resignation of the network's government-appointed president.
   About 5,000 of the network's 7,000 workers have been staging
peaceful protests since April 12. They claim the new president, Suh
Ki-won, a former government official, will give the government
greater control over TV and radio broadcasts and stand in the way
of press freedom.

<HEAD>Judge Finds Union Leaders Condone Violence Against Greyhound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the Greyhound bus drivers' union have
condoned, permitted or ratified acts of violence against the
company during their 8-week-old strike, a judge ruled Friday.
   A Greyhound spokesman said the ruling shows that the company
suspicion of a coordinated union effort at intimidation is correct.
   But a union spokesman said leaders of the Phoenix-based
Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions have been solidly
opposed to violence.
   In a lawsuit filed by Dallas-based Greyhound Lines Inc. against
the union and related defendants, Cook County Circuit Judge Thomas
J. O'Brien issued an injunction to set limits on picketing in
Chicago and to bar union members from any direct or indirect acts
of violence.
   The strike against Greyhound began March 2.
   Since then, several incidents of shootings at buses have
occurred nationwide.
   As part of the text of his injunction, O'Brien wrote he had
enough evidence to believe 12 instances of violence or intimidation
cited in the lawsuit and directed at Greyhound, its employees or
passengers, had occurred in Chicago since the beginning of the
strike.
   He also wrote he found union members or officials to have direct
or indirect blame.
   The judge wrote that union President Edward M. Strait of
Phoenix, as well as named officials of union locals 1150, 1303 and
1126, had ``condoned, permitted and-or ratified the acts of
violence, intimidations and-or harassment.''
   While the case is local and specifies picketing rules at two
Greyhound facilities in Chicago, Gravley said the ruling backs up
what Greyhound officials have been saying _ that violence aimed at
Greyhound buses and facilities nationwide ``are not sporadic ...
events.''
   Union spokesman Nick Nichols said from Washington, D.C., that he
couldn't comment on Friday's opinion because he hadn't seen it, but
the union has been opposed to violence.
   ``Obviously, we would take issue with the judge's view on
this,'' Nichols said.
   ``The union and the union leaders involved at the national and
the council level have made it very, very clear that under no
circumstances do they condone violence.''
   He added that just Thursday, bulletins were sent to all locals
asking members with information about any violent acts involving
Greyhound to contact the FBI.
   In addition to enjoining union members from any violence or
intimidation, O'Brien's ruling limits to two the number of pickets
at any vehicle or pedestrial entrance or exit at the two main
Greyhound facilities in Chicago.
   Non-picketing demonstrators must be at least 20 feet away.
   Friday's injunction follows a similar temporary restraining
order issued by Circuit Judge Anthony Scotillo March 2, and
extended March 8 by O'Brien.
   On April 9, Greyhound filed a $30 million civil lawsuit against
the Amalgamated Transit Union and 20 union officers and members
claiming the unions have campaigned to cripple Greyhound
financially and have cost the company at least $10 million. Triple
damages are being sought.

   While astronomers rejoice that the Hubble
Space Telescope is finally circling Earth, some of them are busy
building new instruments that will make the world's best
observatory even better.
   Three Orbital Replacement Instruments under development will be
added to the telescope years from now by astronauts making orbital
service calls.
   Rodger Thompson of the University of Arizona's Steward
Observatory is principal investigator in development of the $80
million Near Infrared Cameras and Multiple Objective Spectrometers,
or NICMOS, which he expects to be taken up to the Hubble in about
six years.
   ``Our particular part of it is scheduled for 1996 launch _
February 10th, 1996, if you want to believe a shuttle manifest that
goes out that far,'' said Thompson, who heads the project's
20-astronomer team.
   NICMOS, with three cameras and three spectrometers, will
concentrate on different wavelengths in the near-infrared portion
of the light spectrum, which none of the five instruments now
aboard the $1.5 billion Hubble can view. Infrared also is invisible
to the human eye.
   Astronomer Richard Green, of the Tucson-headquartered National
Optical Astronomy Observatories, is a co-investigator on another
second-generation instrument being developed, the Space Telescope
Imaging Spectrograph, or STIS.
   He said the Hubble, originally scheduled for launch in 1983, is
``flying technology that's really out of date.''
   The STIS is intended to replace the telescope's two present
spectrographs that will separate light into different wavelengths,
like a prism. The new device will be able to capture an entire
high-resolution spectrum of light from a star in one exposure,
versus about 25 that the instruments now aboard the Hubble will
require, Green said.
   In addition, he said, ``We're working now to fly in '96 more
modern optical light detectors, solid-state imagers and new
light-gathering equipment that will just make massive improvement
in the performance of the telescope,'' he said.
   The third instrument to be installed in orbit is a Wide
Field-Planetary Camera 2, which will take advantage of advances in
electronics that were not available when the current wide field
camera was installed on the Hubble. Its principal investigator is
John Trauger of Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   Each of NICMOS' three cameras will look at different portions of
the field of view, and at different resolutions, said Thompson. He
described it as ``like having three different lenses on your
camera'' _ very high-resolution that sees only a small part of the
field, intermediate and a wide-angle view.
   Similarly, each spectrometer will examine different parts of the
spectrum, and all six instruments will operate at the same time,
greatly increasing efficiency, he said.
   The spectrometers and cameras, each loaded with an array of
light detectors called charged coupled devices, will show how much
light is coming at each wavelength. That will enable astronomers to
identify the composition of the source objects, temperature,
physical conditions under which the objects are being created, even
pressure, density and velocity, he said.
   ``That's why spectroscopy is such a powerful instrument,'' said
Thompson. ``It allows you to learn a lot of detail about the object
that you're looking at.''
   Infrared sightings will shed new understanding on the birth of
stars and makeup of gas clouds, planets and planetary atmospheres.
NICMOS is expected to help determine whether the center of our
galaxy is a black hole or an extremely dense star cluster.
   ``It allows us to see new objects being formed, new galaxies,
new stars and perhaps new planets,'' Thompson said. He said it will
let astronomers see through clouds of galactic dust and gas ``right
down into, let's say, the stellar nurseries, where new stars are
being born, new galaxies are being born.''
   NICMOS is in its final design stages, with construction set to
start next year.
   The launching of the Hubble was ``just the first step for us,''
Thompson said.
   ``We will not be sitting on our hands by any means. We have so
much to do. We will learn a lot from how the telescope operates
that we'll be able to use in putting our instrument together in the
best possible way.''
   ``It's a learning experience. We hope we learn very fast,'' he
said.

Lithuania</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's cautious policy on Lithuania
so unsettled the leader of the breakaway Baltic republic the other
day he charged Bush with ``another Munich.''
   The allegation by Vytautas Landsbergis coupled Bush with Neville
Chamberlain, the British prime minister who struck a deal with
Hitler before World War II permitting Germany to dismember
democratic Czechoslovakia.
   Chamberlain and his black umbrella became modern history's
symbol of appeasement when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939 and set
the world on fire.
   Millions died on battlefields and in concentration camps, and
even the victory of the Allies in 1945 did not return democracy to
Czechoslovakia.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, meanwhile, lost their
independence in another notorious Nazi pact _ the one in 1939 with
Moscow that precipitated the Soviets' absorption of the Baltics a
year later.
   And how did Bush merit this badge of dishonor pinned on him by
the Lithuanian president?
   By deferring economic sanctions against the Soviet Union while
waiting to see if the Kremlin and Lithuanians agree on terms for
negotiations to settle their dispute peacefully.
   Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III repeatedly have
asserted their support for Lithuanian independence, publicly and
privately.
   ``The people of Lithuania must not be denied their rights,''
Baker said in testimony Wednesday to a Senate appropriations
subcommittee. ``We support the aspirations of the Lithuanian people
for freedom and self-determination.''
   That same day Landsbergis was on the telephone to members of
Congress complaining that ``the West doesn't want to help
Lithuania.'' He said ``our reaction is one of discouragement and
disappointment. It feels as if our worst fears are being realized.''
   The Soviets have set a precondition for dealing with the
Lithuanians _ that they withdraw their March 11 declaration of
independence.
   Two Western leaders, President Francois Mitterrand of France and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, on Thursday urged Lithuania
to take that step.
   If they do, the Soviets are willing to permit Lithuanian
independence under a new legal procedure. It could take up to five
years, and the Lithuanians would be required to negotiate financial
and territorial terms with Moscow.
   But in the end they stand to regain their independence.
   Czechoslovakia's prospects after Munich were horrendously
different.
   Chamberlain, with the acquiescence of France, had signed an
agreement with Germany in September 1938 guaranteeing peace. Within
days, Germany occupied the German-speaking Sudetenland. The
following March, Hitler made a protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.
Slovakia proclaimed its independence with Germany's support.
   Independent Czechoslovakia was no more.
   Soviet troops entered the country in 1944, and in 1948
communists seized control of the country. It is only now reverting
to the democracy proclaimed in 1918 and lost at Munich.
   Chamberlain proclaimed ``peace in our time'' when he returned to
London from Munich. He had widespread support from the British
people. They turned to Winston Churchill, who had opposed the pact
with Hitler, only after the Nazis' real intentions became apparent.
   Bush, responding to Lithuania's Landsbergis, declared on
Wednesday: ``The policies and decisions I've taken have had strong
support from the American people, and that's who I work for.''
   But that is where the parallel with Chamberlain reasonably
should end.
   Both leaders enjoy public support, but the American president
and Lithuania are on a vastly different course from the one
Chamberlain and Czechoslovakia traveled a half-century ago.

<HEAD>AAA: Motorists Paying to Get Rid of `Ping' Get `Pot Luck'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Those yellow and black federal labels that
give the octane rating on gas pumps should be torn off because of
cheating by gas stations and lax enforcement, the American
Automobile Association says.
   Reacting to a congressional report Thursday that estimates
octane cheating could be costing motorists $150 million a year, AAA
spokesman William Berman said car owners have only a 50-50 chance
of getting the octane they pay for.
   The report by the General Accounting Office found cheating by
more than half of the service stations tested in Detroit and St.
Louis last year, although it said only suspected cheaters were
tested and that those results could not be projected nationwide.
   ``Car owners shouldn't have to take pot luck when they fill up
their tank,'' Berman said. ``Those aging octane stickers out on the
gas pumps are essentially meaningless and should be removed.''
   A representative of service station operators accused Berman of
exaggerating the problem and criticized the report as too sweeping
an indictment of an industry that sells 113 billion gallons of gas
a year.
   ``Service station operators have investments of $100,000 or
more, and they're not going to jeopardize that,'' said Joseph
Koach, executive director of the 60,000-member Service Station
Dealers of America. But he acknowledged that there are some
``fly-by-night cheaters.''
   ``If the consumer wants to be protected, he can be protected by
buying gas from qualified members of associations,'' Koach said.
   A report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm
of Congress, said that motorists who are buying higher-octane gas
to get the ``ping'' out of their engines may be paying a premium
price for gas that sometimes comes from the same storage tank as
cheaper regular fuel.
   Federal law requires that uniform labels on gas pumps show the
octane rating of each type of gas _ 87 for regular unleaded, 89 for
leaded regular and mid-grade unleaded and 91 to 94 for premium
grades.
   The higher the octane, the more ability the gas has to get rid
of ``ping'' or metallic ``knocking'' in the engine.
   A low-octane gasoline can reduce engine efficiency, mileage and
emissions in high-powered engines, the GAO said.
   The GAO said the federal government has done little to stop the
deception, although nearly half the states have testing programs
that have curbed cheating.
   Rep. Philip R. Sharp, D-Ind., who released the report with Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the study's estimate of $150 million
in losses is conservative. He said the figure could reach as high
as $600 million through growing mislabeling of octane ratings at
the pump.
   ``Unfortunately, consumers cannot determine octane ratings
visually or in other ways that allow them to know if they are
getting what they are paying for,'' the report said.
   It said problems were found in seven non-testing states visited
by GAO investigators, mainly at the distribution and retail levels.
   Frequent octane mislabeling was found in one-time tests
conducted in Michigan, Missouri, Oregon and Tennessee, the GAO
said, and investigators also found concern about octane cheating
from officials interviewed in Indiana, Montana and Washington.
   In 1989 Michigan tests conducted primarily in Detroit, 51.9
percent of stations had inflated ratings averaging 2.3 octane
points, and in St. Louis 52.6 percent had mislabeled an average of
2.2 points, the report said.
   In tests conducted in 1988, 21.8 percent of samples in Oregon
and 22.2 percent in Tennessee were mislabeled, the GAO said.
   States that now handle their own tests and enforcement are
Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia and Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   It's too late for Angela Carder to claim
victory, but her parents say they hope they've helped others by
winning a court ruling that affirms the right of pregnant women to
control their own medical care.
   Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient who was 26 weeks pregnant,
died two days after a court-ordered Caesarean section at George
Washington University Hospital here. Her baby died less than three
hours after the operation, which was listed as a contributing cause
in Carder's death.
   Her parents say she did not want the surgery and did not give
informed consent.
   ``We really thought all along that Angie would be vindicated in
some way,'' said Daniel Stoner, her father. ``It's too late for her
now. But I guess it will help somebody else. If there's ever
another case like this, it should really help.''
   The closely watched case was resolved Thursday when the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals said a lower court was wrong to weigh
Carder's rights against those of the fetus when the heavily sedated
patient's wishes were unclear.
   The appeals court said the lower court should have tried harder
to figure out what Carder would have wanted done, given her goals,
values, prognosis and attitude toward her pregnancy.
   In any case, the opinion said, a pregnant woman's decision to
refuse medical treatment is almost always paramount _ even when
survival of a fetus is at stake.
   ``A fetus cannot have rights ... superior to those of a person
who has already been born,'' the court said in a 7-1 decision that
took nearly two years to emerge. It said only in a rare,
exceptional circumstance would it be legal to override a pregnant
woman's decision.
   The appeals court ruling is binding only in the district, but
there are so few precedents in the area that other courts are
expected to look to it as they wrestle with questions of maternal
versus fetal rights.
   More than 100 groups backed the American Civil Liberties Union
in the quest to reverse the lower-court ruling. They all declared
victory, as did the hospital and the lawyer who represented the
fetus.
   ACLU attorney Lynn Paltrow, who brought the case, faulted the
lower court judge for failing to visit Carder's bedside to see if
she were competent to make a decision. She contends the woman could
have.
   ``He treated her as if she were already dead,'' Paltrow said.
``The bottom line is you can't deny women their civil rights. You
can't treat women as dead just because they're pregnant.''
   Dawn Johnsen, legal director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, called the case a significant precedent that could
stem a trend toward government interference on behalf of so-called
fetal rights. She said the interference has ranged from ordering
Caesarian sections to jailing pregnant women so they don't drink or
take drugs.
   ``Since there are so few decisions on this issue, I would expect
it (the D.C. ruling) to be extremely persuasive in other areas of
the country,'' Johnsen said.
   Vincent Burke, the attorney for the hospital, agreed that the
decision would be valuable for doctors, lawyers and families facing
such situations.
   ``The main reason we went to court was that it was a difficult
issue and there was no precedent,'' he said. ``We weren't seeking a
specific outcome. We wanted guidance and the court's now given us
guidance.''
   The path laid out by the court involves a procedure called
``substituted judgment,'' in which a court tries to extrapolate
from a patient's values and goals what kind of decision he or she
would make. The primary factor in such a judgment would be a
patient's previously expressed wishes, the court said.
   Barbara Mishkin, who represented the fetus, said she was happy
with the opinion and agreed that ``it's her life. It's her right.
It's her body. It's her medical decision.''
   However, she asserted that Carder would have wanted the
operation and that is what a substituted-judgment proceeding would
have concluded. As for the opposition of Carder's parents, Mishkin
said they did not believe Carder's husband would bring up the child
and ``they didn't want to be stuck taking care of a baby.''
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge James A. Belson said he agreed
with the lower court's decision to weigh the interests of Carder
against those of her fetus.
   The judge said an unborn child's interests and the state's
interest in preserving human life are entitled to ``substantial
weight'' when they are in conflict with a patient's decision on
medical treatment.
   The Stoners have filed a civil suit against the hospital,
charging their daughter did not get proper care because the
hospital feared the effect of treatment on the fetus.

<HEAD>US, Soviet Union Reach Agreement to Normalize Trade Relations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is hailing a new
agreement to normalize trade relations with the Soviet Union for
the first time in nearly a half-century, but the proposal is
expected to encounter stiff opposition in Congress.
   One congressional critic said the administration couldn't have
picked a worse time to negotiate the agreement because of the
Soviet crackdown in Lithuania.
   The pact, if ratified by Congress, would clear the way for
significantly lower tariffs on Soviet products while expanding
business opportunities for U.S. companies in the Soviet Union.
   While President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
had made signing a trade agreement a top priority for their
upcoming summit, Bush was urged by some in the administration to
cancel the talks to protest Soviet actions in Lithuania.
   However, the president announced Tuesday that he had decided
against imposing economic sanctions for fear that such an action
would imperil the progress being made in pulling Eastern Europe
away from Soviet control.
   This decision cleared the way for the trade talks to proceed in
Paris. Deputy Trade Representative Julius Katz, head of the U.S.
delegation, said at the end of Thursday's discussions that both
sides had reached basic agreement.
   Katz predicted the document would be ready for signing at the
May 30-June 3 summit in Washington. He said all that remained was
resolving wording disagreements in four relatively minor areas.
   ``Fundamentally, we have reached agreement on the text,'' Katz
said in a telephone conference call from Paris.
   Under U.S. law, the new economic agreement cannot be signed
until Bush certifies that the Soviet Union is allowing the free
emigration of Jews and other dissidents.
   Bush has said he will sign such a waiver once the Soviet Union's
more liberalized emigration policy is written into law by the
Soviet legislature.
   The trade agreement must be approved by Congress before it can
take effect, however. Some members' unhappiness over the Soviets'
refusal to grant independence to Lithuania is certain to be an
issue raised by opponents.
   ``There couldn't be a worse time'' for the agreement, said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. ``We're selling at a cut rate the rope that
would be used to hang the Lithuanians.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee,
which would have jurisdiction over the pact, has warned that he
would work to block Senate approval because of an unrelated trade
issue.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, is unhappy because the administration
apparently has decided not to target Japan as an unfair trader
under a tough section of the 1988 trade act.
   He said such a decision would ``poison the well'' in Congress
not only for the Soviet trade agreement but for other
administration trade initiatives.
   Bush has expressed the hope that normalizing U.S.-Soviet trade
relations would give a boost to the ailing Soviet economy and
bolster Gorbachev's political reform efforts.
   The agreement is needed to grant the Soviet Union
most-favored-nation status, qualifying it for the lowest tariffs
granted to any other country.
   Currently, Soviet products sold in the United States bear duties
as much as 10 times higher than imports from other countries. By
one estimate, the price of Soviet vodka could drop by $1.25 per
bottle.
   The higher tariffs were the result of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik
amendment, which was passed by Congress in retaliation for Soviet
emigration restrictions in effect at the time.
   U.S. officials have predicted that trade between the Soviet
Union and the United States could double or even triple over the
next three years with a new trade agreement. Private economists
doubt that assessment, given the numerous troubles plaguing the
Soviet economy.
   Last year, trade between the countries totaled $5 billion. U.S.
export sales, which totaled $4.3 billion, reflected primarily grain
shipments. Soviet sales in this country, totaling $703 million,
included petroleum and consumer items such as vodka and furs.

   The Navy's $44 billion Seawolf attack
submarine program is moving ahead despite serious deficiencies in a
computer program that guides the craft and its weapons, a
congressional oversight panel reported Thursday.
   The congressional investigation turned up an internal Navy memo
pointing out problems in the computer system. Rep. John Conyers
Jr., D-Mich., who headed the probe, questioned whether the Navy can
produce a submarine that can hunt and kill enemy submarines as it
is supposed to do.
   ``Without the computer software, the Seawolf submarine is just
so much metal floating around out there,'' said Conyers, chairman
of the national security subcommittee of the House Government
Operations Committee.
   The probe conducted by the subcommittee and the General
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, focused on the
BSY-2 computer system, referred to colloquially as the ``busy-two.''
   The highly sophisticated system is built for the Navy by General
Electric. It is designed specifically for the Seawolf, which is
built in Groton, Conn., by General Dynamics Corp., and in Newport
News, Va., by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co.
   ``It has recently come to my attention that serious deficiencies
in the busy-two software development program have been identified
by Department of Defense software experts,'' Conyers said.
``However, it is by no means clear that corrective actions have
been taken.''
   At Thursday's hearing, top Navy officials in charge of Seawolf
said they were unaware of a March 19 internal Navy memo detailing
problems in the computer software. Conyers had copies of the memo
but did not release it to the public.
   The Navy's top acquisition official, Assistant Secretary Gerald
A. Cann, said he would respond to the memo as soon as it could be
studied. But he said there was little risk that any technical
problems would significantly delay delivery of the system to
Groton, where the first Seawolf is under construction.
   ``I don't think we have a flaming disaster here,'' Cann said.
   A spokesman for G.E. said he would seek a response to the issues
raised at the hearing from experts familiar with the computer
system.
   According to Conyers, the memo listed a number of problems
including the Navy's failure to program all of the computers'
complex function in a single computer language developed for
sophisticated weaponry.
   The memo, written by a Navy software expert, questioned the
reliability of the computer systems, which govern virtually all of
Seawolf's movements and weaponry. The BSY-2 is specifically
designed to enable Seawolf to detect and locate targets faster than
existing submarine combat systems and to allow operators to detect
and attack multiple targets.
   Frank Conahan, who headed the GAO investigation of Seawolf,
called the BSY-2 system ``one of the most technically challenging
and complex software development efforts ever undertaken for a
submarine.''
   The Navy has no alternative to the BSY-2 system under
consideration, Conahan warned, and problems in development of the
computer could lead to costly delays in completion of the
submarines.
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, noted that there has already been a $10 million cost
overrun in completion of the first two BSY-2 systems.
   Pending congressional approval, the Navy plans to buy 29
Seawolfs by the year 2000 at an estimated cost of $44 billion. G.E.
was awarded a $1.8 billion contract to develop the BSY-2 in 1988.
Assuming the entire run of submarines is built, the computer
equipment alone would account for $7.4 billion of the cost,
according to Conahan.
   It is far more likely, Conyers said, that the pressure to reduce
defense spending will scale down the size of the Seawolf program
significantly. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is conducting a
detailed review of the need for Seawolf and is expected to present
findings next month. Conyers said the problems with the Seawolf
program discovered by the subcommittee and the GAO will be a part
of Cheney's review.

   It's been 2{ years since Joan Rivers' husband
committed suicide but the comedian says she only recently was able
to listen to a taped message he left her.
   ``It was terrible, terrible because the voice is the voice of
someone I loved who had already taken pills and was saying
goodbye,'' she said in an interview published in Sunday's Parade
magazine. ``That's all I want to say but I will never listen to
that tape again. Never.''
   Her husband of 22 years, Edgar Rosenberg, took an overdose of
prescription drugs in August 1987.
   Rivers said getting fired from her syndicated show on the Fox
network and the negative publicity she received when she left NBC
contributed to her husband's depression.
   ``He blamed himself for everything,'' Rivers said. ``Edgar
internalized it. He thought, like everyone else, that my career was
over, and he thought he had brought it on.''
   But Rivers refused to give up on her 25-year career. She went to
England and was a hit; today she's packing Atlantic City clubs and
is host of a daily syndicated, daytime talk show.
   ``Edgar would have loved seeing me come full circle,'' she says.

<HEAD>Congress Approves Recommendation to Ban North, Poindexter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costa Rica's congress has approved a
recommendation to bar from the country John Poindexter, Oliver
North and others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Thursday's vote is not legally binding, however.
   The legislature voted 51-1 with five abstentions in favor of the
recommendations of a commission that also said former U.S.
Ambassador Lewis Tambs and businessman Richard Secord should not be
allowed to enter the country.
   The commission said Costa Rica was used during the Iran-Contra
affair as a supply route for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   President Oscar Arias, who hands over power to President-elect
Rafael Angel Calderon on May 8, has not commented on the
recommendations.
   Poindexter, North and Secord have been convicted in the secret
operation during the Reagan adminstration to sell arms to Iran and
use the profits to support the rebels fighting the then-leftist
Nicaraguan government.
   Poindexter was national security adviser and North a White House
aide during the Reagan administration. Secord is a retired Air
Force major general.
   Tambs was accused of having knowledge of North's activities but
was never charged.
   The commission found that Poindexter and North supported sending
supplies to the Contras through Costa Rica, in violation of the
Central American nation's neutrality. It also alleged that Tambs
and rancher John Hull were involved in Contra operations in Costa
Rica.
   ``This network allowed Colombian and Panamanian drug traffickers
to transport drugs to the United States in exchange for arms for
the Contras,'' the commission said in a statement.
   It recommended that Hull's Costa Rican nationality be annulled.
The Indiana-born Hull, 70, took Costa Rican citizenship while
living 20 years in the country as a rancher.
   Earlier this year, Costa Rica began seeking his extradition from
the United States, where he fled last year while out on bail on
charges of aiding the Contras. Hull has denied the charges.
   The congressional vote came two days after former President
Daniel Oduber was suspended from participation in his political
party for a year. The governing National Liberation Party banned
Oduber for having accepted campaign contributions from an American
accused of drug trafficking.
   Lionel Casey, who allegedly donated $12,000 to Oduber in 1985,
is in jail in Costa Rica awaiting extradition to the United States
on drug charges.
   Casey, 60, of Raleigh, N.C., has been in Costa Rica since 1982.
The commission recommended that he be deported.

<TEXT>
   Australia's third-largest city,
Brisbane, could soon face smog as bad as the pollution in Los
Angeles, scientists said today.
   The researchers warned in a report that without action, the city
of 1 million could become an ``environmental disaster'' within a
decade.
   Like Los Angeles, the capital of Queensland state is especially
vulnerable to pollution because of its geographic location and
atmospheric conditions, they said.
   The Brisbane area is the fastest growing in Australia, and the
city's population is expected to more than double in the next 10
years.
   The study, by scientists at Griffith University, called for a
reduction in the number of private cars in the city and better
emission control for trucks. It also called for better public
transport and stricter controls on industry. Without such measures,
the report said, Brisbane could find itself choking in ``a
petrochemical smog caused by an extremely unpleasant mixture of
gases'' that could lead to health problems including respiratory
disease, heart failure and eye irritation.

<HEAD>Study Links Radon Gas to Variety of Cancers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radon gas, long known to cause lung cancer, may be
linked to a variety of other cancers as well, British researchers
said today.
   In an article in The Lancet, a respected British medical
journal, three physicists from Bristol University said they had
found a connection between radon levels and the incidence of
certain non-lung cancers.
   The study used data from 15 countries, including the United
States.
   Margo Oge, director of the radon program at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, said that previously researchers
have failed to link radon and non-lung cancers.
   Studies purporting to do so ``haven't been able to pass
scientific scrutiny,'' she said Thursday in a telephone interview
ahead of the article's publication. She said she could not comment
specifically on the British study because she had not seen it.
   Radon is a dense, odorless gas, created by the radioactive decay
of small quantities of uranium found in many types of rock.
   It has been known for decades to cause lung cancer. The
scientists said they stumbled on the link to other cancers last
September when they realized radon is highly soluble in the fatty
globules found in bone marrow.
   ``Previous researchers seem to have made the mistake of only
considering the amount of radon in the blood, where it appeared the
effect was negligible,'' said physicist Jonathan Eatough, one of
the authors. ``But when the fatty globules are examined, the radon
becomes a significant factor in the dose to the bone marrow.''
   The scientists said they found an association of radon exposure
and leukemia in children and adults; brain, spine, bone and skin
cancer in children; and kidney and skin cancer in adults.
   ``Our observations in general clearly warrant urgent and
detailed further investigations to determine whether radon is
indeed the causative factor as we hypothesize,'' the scientists
said.
   They said some findings, such as the association of radon
exposure and incidents of skin cancer, were unexpected.
   But they said it could explain current anomalies in the pattern
of these cancers, such as the high incidence of melanoma in
Scandinavian countries, where the population is not exposed to high
levels of harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun.
   Dr. Denis Henshaw, another of the authors, said the study is
actually ``good news scientifically'' because ``we believe we may
have found a cause for cancer you can do something about.''
   Radon seeps into homes and buildings through foundations and
floorboards. Steps can be taken to keep it out, including sealing
floorboards with plastic sheeting and installing below-floor
extractor fans to channel the gas away.
   The countries in the study were Canada, Denmark, Finland,
France, West Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Netherlands,
Poland, Switzerland, Sweden, Britain and the United States.

<HEAD>Farmland Values Up for Third Straight Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: 1st Add is state-by-state table.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmland values nationally rose in 1989 for
the third straight year and may go up again in 1990, but the
Agriculture Department isn't saying much about this year's
prospects.
   Roger Hexem of the department's Economic Research Service says
the agency's 1990 forecast will be issued later this spring. There
are always uncertainties about farmland prices, and this year is a
bit more complicated than usual, he said.
   Weather and general economic conditions are the usual concerns.
And this year Congress is slowly grinding out a new farm bill that
will set national agricultural policy for the next five years.
   Some of that will bear on federal price supports for key
commodities such as wheat, corn and cotton. Export subsidies,
research and marketing programs also enter into decisions on
whether to buy or sell farmland.
   Hexem said the current multinational negotiations under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are other unknowns that
could influence land price movements.
   But the USDA economist said Thursday in a telephone interview
that the average increase of farmland values in each of the last
three years was a little more than 4 percent, which ``pretty much
tracked the rate of inflation'' during the same period.
   ``I'm not saying that's going to happen (in 1990),'' Hexem said.
``But that's been kind of the historical trend over the last three
years.''
   A week ago, the USDA agency reported that farmland values
nationally rose 4 percent, averaging $693 per acre as of Jan. 1, up
from a revised average of $667 a year earlier.
   Hexem said revisions were made in state and national farmland
values as a result of the 1987 census of agriculture. These
revisions, based on the census information collected every five
years, are part of the agency's regular longstanding procedure, he
said.
   Despite the recent upturn in farmland values _ which include
land and buildings _ the Jan. 1, 1990, national average of $693 per
acre was still 16 percent below the record of $823 per acre in 1982.
   Hexem said estimates were developed from an ``opinion survey''
of farmers and ranchers about land values in their counties. The
figures are not based on actual sales of farmland.
   The Jan. 1 land values in the Corn Belt showed only a 2 percent
increase from a year earlier, including a 1 percent dip in Ohio and
a 4 percent increase in Missouri.
   ``I would have expected the percentage increase (in the Corn
Belt) to be higher than the survey indicated,'' Hexem said. Lower
soybean prices probably had a dampening effect, he said.
   Pockets of drought still exist in the western Corn Belt and
northern plains, which also can affect the price outlook.
   States estimates can vary greatly and often show much greater
movements than the national figures, Hexem said. Some things happen
in one state and not another.
   For example, Hexem said, the importance of water and the
structure of agriculture in many of the Western states is much
different from other regions.
   ``There's quite a range in the value of farmland, depending on
whether or not you have water,'' he said.
   And there are other regional factors. In the Northeast, which
has the highest regional value for farmland _ $1,802 per acre _
prices range from $5,080 per acre in Rhode Island to $1,029 in
Maine.
   Hexem said the Northeast has no water problems as in the West,
but there is a ``mix of demand'' for land in some states, including
the demands of developers and people looking for second homes and
retirement homes.
   The figures are for 48 states, with Alaska reported separately
and Hawaii omitted entirely.
   Hexem said Alaska has farmland but that it represents a small
portion of the state and is considered a special case for
statistical purposes. Hawaii has a relatively small amount of
farmland, which he said doesn't change hands very often.
   Here is a state-by-state list of weighted average per-acre
values of farmland and buildings. The first column shows, in
dollars, the revised value as of Feb. 1, 1989, and the second is
the value as of Jan. 1, 1990. An 11-month period was used because
the agency shifted to a Jan. 1 reporting date.
   Alaska, not on the following list, was reported at $232 per
acre, down from a revised $250 a year earlier. There was no listing
for Hawaii.

   Ranchers and their friends voted to hold a
prairie dog shooting contest and told the governor and others who
didn't like the idea to ``buzz off.''
   The Ten Ring Gun Club of Nucla and neighboring Naturita
organized the contest recently to thin out the prairie dog
population. They said the animals carry bubonic plague and dig
holes that break the legs of cattle.
   Townspeople hoped the contests would be a tourist attraction.
They invited hunting enthusiasts and visitors to the depressed town
for the July 14-15 contest, where they estimated about 500 prairie
dogs would perish.
   Animal rights got wind of the contest and lobbied Gov. Roy Romer
and Democratic Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, who announced their
opposition.
   So the gun club held an open meeting in this town of 1,000
Thursday night to decide the fate of the contest. Only three of the
318 people who showed up voted against it.
   ``Governor Romer, Congressman Campbell, buzz off,'' Nucla Mayor
John Vanderpool said after the vote.
   Romer and Campbell had said the hunt was a cruel spectacle and
not a proper method of rodent extermination. Animal rights groups
and humane societies wanted to save the prairie dogs.
   Officials in Nucla and Naturita, in a remote corner of southwest
Colorado, said they hoped to make the shoot an annual affair. The
towns are so desperate for jobs they tried unsuccessfully to lure a
low-level radioactive waste dump to the area.
   The town needs something to bring it back to life, said elderly
Nucla resident Thomas Langan.
   ``I don't care if it's a prairie dog shoot or a yuppie shoot,''
he said to great laughter from the crowd.
   Doylene Garvey said she was angered by city folk telling
ranchers how to care for the land.
   ``They live in polluted cities where homeless people go, so why
don't they put their energies to that,'' she said.
   Several speakers said the shoot was preferable to poison.
   Federal agencies have banned the use of most poisons because
they enter the food chain when eagles, coyotes and other natural
predators of prairie dogs eat the carcasses.
   One of the three people who voted against the shoot, Katherine
Hesse of Nucla, said she is not against shooting prairie dogs and
has shot many herself.
   ``But I don't like the circus ... It's not right,'' she said.
``If you have a problem on your land, take care of it and not for
money. This is a poor way to handle it.''

<HEAD>Suspect Unlikely to Stand Trial in Stabbing of Politician,
Prosecutor Says</HEAD>

   A mentally disturbed woman who said
she stabbed opposition politician Oskar Lafontaine to ``get in the
news'' is probably unfit to stand trial, a prosecutor says.
   Lafontaine, who was stabbed in the neck with a butcher knife at
a campaign rally, was in satisfactory condition at a Cologne
hospital Thursday, a day after the attack.
   The attack on Lafontaine, a Social Democrat and Helmut Kohl's
leading challenger in the December election, was the most serious
on a top-ranking West German politician in the country's 41-year
history.
   It raised security concerns among politicians in both East
Germany and West Germany, but many conceded that absolute security
is impossible without shutting off public access to officials.
   There was no indication the attack was politically motivated,
said Helmut Schaefer, chief prosecutor for the state of North
Rhine-Westphalia.
   Authorities said the suspect, identified as Adelheid Streidel,
42, was sent to a a psychiatric clinic for evaluation. She has a
history of mental illness, they said.
   They said she admitted stabbing Lafontaine after approaching him
with flowers and asking for his autograph at the campaign rally in
Cologne.
   Schaefer said the woman probably is not fit to stand trial
because of her mental condition.
   He quoted her as saying: ``I wanted to kill Mr. Lafontaine so
that I would have to go to court and then I'd get in the news.''
   Friends who visited Lafontaine Thursday said he was able to get
out of his hospital bed and make jokes.
   Hans Jochen-Vogel, the Social Democratic Party chairman, said
Lafontaine intends to ``remain the chancellor candidate.''
   Vogel said Lafontaine narrowly escaped death. The knife missed a
main artery by just a ``couple of millimeters,'' he said.
``Otherwise we would be in mourning.''
   Social Democratic Party officials, told during a special meeting
in Bonn that Lafontaine was out of danger, burst into applause.
   Lafontaine, 46, the governor of tiny Saarland state, is one of
West Germany's most colorful and popular politicians. His stabbing
brought an outpouring of sympathy from across the political
spectrum.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was among those who sent
telegrams wishing Lafontaine a speedy recovery, the official East
German news agency ADN said.
   Lafontaine, whose left-leaning party trounced Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union in state elections in January, is considered a
tough opponent for the December national elections. He has opposed
Kohl's call for speedy German unification.

   When Lynda Wright was on welfare, strangers
berated her in supermarket lines, social workers asked about her
sex life and her heart sometimes told her she was doomed to fail.
   Five years after pulling herself off public aid, Wright helped
found Welfare Alumni to spare today's recipients some pain.
   ``I want to hold out my hand to them and say, `You can make
it,''' said the 46-year-old mother of four. ``Being on welfare is
... an experience that leaves scars.''
   The organization was formed last year to attack myths about
people on welfare. High on the list, Wright said, is that ``they're
lazy .... and watch TV all day.''
   In 1988, about 3.7 million families nationwide got help under
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, according to
the American Public Welfare Association in Washington.
   Association studies show about 30 percent of family heads who
become eligible for assistance stay on welfare for less than a
year, said spokesman Rick Ferreira.
   About 75 percent, like Wright, are on for less than five years.
   Wright's group is compiling a book to encourage those who are
struggling to become self-sufficient. It will include photographs
and stories of people who have gotten off welfare.
   Alumni members also speak to church, school and community
groups, often retelling personal stories.
   Wright's nightmare, like other women on welfare, started when
her husband divorced her 10 years ago and left her and the children
with no money.
   ``I had the American dream: the family, the house, the kids, the
car,'' she said of her 17-year marriage. ``And then all of a sudden
I went from a nice income to zero. I went straight down.''
   Wright couldn't find a job and was barely scraping together
money to feed her children. Within months, her telephone, gas and
electric service were cut off.
   ``We lived from day to day. If there wasn't anything for that
day, sometimes my neighbors would be kind and lend us some food,''
Wright said. ``I remember standing at the door one day and breaking
down. I knew I had to go on welfare. ... I didn't want to see my
children starve.''
   Wright had many dehumanizing experiences.
   A shopper behind her in a food store once criticized her for
buying a beef roast intended to celebrate her daughter's good
grades. The woman, Wright recalled, said, ```I'm working and I
can't afford a beef roast. I can't see how you can afford one.'''
   Social workers on house visits eyed her possessions to make sure
she wasn't spending money frivolously.
   They asked if she was sleeping with anyone to make sure there
wasn't another source of support in the house that would make her
ineligible for benefits.
   ``I felt less than a human being,'' Wright said. ``I felt like I
was just stupid _ everybody knew how to get a job except me.
Everybody had skills except me.''
   But things changed. Wright found meaningful work and went off
welfare. She has a fulltime job at the Public Welfare Coalition, an
advocacy group where she and other women got the idea for forming
the Alumni.
   ``We were just talking about how we'd been through a lot,''
Wright said. ``And we wanted to see how we could help somebody
who's still going through it.''

   First there was a Moscow McDonald's. Can a
Gorky ``Porky's'' be far behind?
   Maybe not. The USSR Film Service Corp. has opened a Los Angeles
office, encouraging U.S. moviemakers to film their projects in the
Soviet Union.
   All comers _ from historical films to a Soviet ``Lonesome Dove''
called ``A Cowboy and a Cossack'' _ are welcome, say the
organizers, even leftover Cold Warrior types.
   So far, the office has provided production assistance for
filming in the Soviet Union of the movies ``Peter the Great'' and
``Dark Eyes,'' and the television shows ``Dallas,'' ``Head of the
Class'' and ``Road to Africa.''
   The two-person Film Service staff now is handling 60 projects in
various stages of development. The latest is the cable movie
``Final Warning,'' starring Jon Voight as Dr. Robert Gale, the U.S.
doctor who treated radiation sickness caused by the Chernobyl
disaster.
   What are the advantages of shooting in the Soviet Union? The
USSR Film Service tempts producers with an array of outdoor
locations, affordable labor, a growing pool of actors and
technicians and some fairly modern equipment.
   Such improvements only came recently.
   ``We have 39 motion picture studios in the country,'' said Yuri
Spilny, the company's chief executive officer. ``But they are not
in perfect shape and some of the equipment is outdated.''
   Soyuzkinoservice, known as SKS, is the parent company of the
Film Service, and helps provide logistical support. If you need the
Soviet army for a battle scene, SKS will arrange it. Need help
getting through customs? They can assist you there, too.
   SKS has entered into a joint deal with a British supplier to
provide catering trucks, makeup trailers and lighting equipment for
all productions.
   For the upcoming feature film, ``The Siege of Leningrad,'' SKS
helped reconstruct a model of the title city in World War II period
detail.
   ``It's a huge construction job,'' Spilny said. ``To do this in
the United States would probably be four to five times more
expensive.'' The film also will use German equipment left behind in
the war.
   What happens if somebody wants to make a movie similar to the
red scare drama ``Red Dawn''?
   ``If a film is pure nonsense _ well, it's still possible, but
government organizations will not get involved with it,'' Spilny
said.
   Several U.S. companies have expressed interest in making a film
about Stalin, said David Gamburg, the president of Film Service.
   ``The Soviet Union hasn't yet dealt with Stalin himself because
it's such a painful subject,'' Gamburg said. ``We've been trying
not to do with Stalin what the NBC miniseries did about Mussolini.
We want to make a philosophical drama and not romanticize him.''
   The company takes on the work for a percentage of the film's
budget, and will make close to $1 million for its work on ``Final
Warning.'' Spilny said that in three years the company will be
profitable.
   As a side business, the office is also trying to bring more
Soviet films to American theaters.
   ``Russia wants to get into the world market,'' Spilny said. ``We
do about 150 theatrical films a year, but there is no distribution
beyond our borders.''

<HEAD>Administration Accused of Blocking Testimony on Dam's Effects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House Interior Committee leader is accusing
the Bush administration of blocking testimony from officials who
could explain whether an electricity-producing dam is damaging the
Grand Canyon.
   An Interior Department spokesman, however, says the
administration will cooperate with Rep. George Miller's
subcommittee probe of the Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River.
   ``The Department of Interior, by imposing a gag order on
National Park and U.S. Fish and Wildlife employees, has
demonstrated again its unwillingness to engage in a full public
discussion about the impact of its operations on the Grand
Canyon,'' Miller said Thursday after witnesses from those agencies
failed to appear before his subcommittee on water, power and
offshore energy resources.
   Miller says the Interior Department is moving too slowly on an
environmental impact statement on the effects of the dam. He has
introduced a bill that would force the department to change
operations at the dam until the study is complete.
   The witnesses who testified at a hearing Thursday presented a
scenario that pits preservation of one of the world's natural
wonders against the need for electrical power in the southwestern
United States.
   The daily fluctuations in the river flow caused by the dam have
greatly changed the ecosystem of the river bed and the Grand
Canyon, said W. Linn Montgomery, biologist from Northern Arizona
University.
   Miller said a Department of Interior study issued last year
found that the dam was having ``substantial adverse effects on the
downstream resources'' including the Grand Canyon.
   ``It might as well be running hundreds of bulldozers down the
canyon floor daily,'' he said.
   When only Dennis Underwood, commissioner of the Bureau of
Reclamation, showed up at Thursday's hearing, Miller refused to
accept his testimony.
   ``As chairman of the subcommittee, I could not allow the
department to present distorted, one-sided testimony,'' said Miller.
   Steve Goldstein, Interior Department spokesman, said Underwood
was prepared to present all views on the dam from the department,
including those in disagreement with current policy.
   ``We don't dispute there is a dissenting view within the
department,'' said Goldstein. ``That's normal with an agency with
10 bureaus and 70,000 employees.''
   But he said Underwood was sent as a representative of the
administration's view.
   Miller said he would schedule another hearing when the others
could testify. Goldstein said they would appear.
   In a letter to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, sent after the
hearing, Miller said: ``Glen Canyon Dam is being operated in a
manner which threatens the Grand Canyon National Park, Glen Canyon
National Recreation Area, endangered species and other fish and
wildlife resources.''
   ``The members of our subcommittees are entitled to have
witnesses available who have the expertise and authority to address
these problems,'' said Miller.
   There is no environmental emergency related to operation of the
dam, said Joe Falbo of the Colorado River Energy Distributors
Association, whose members buy power generated by the Glen Canyon
Dam and others in the Colorado River Storage Project.
   ``Glen Canyon is really the backbone of the system and accounts
for 70 percent of all the power that can be generated on CRSP dams
in the Upper Colorado River Basin,'' said Falbo.
   He said the utilities turn to power from the dams at peak
periods, allowing them to burn less coal and oil.
   ``Hydropower is a clean, renewable electric resource,'' he said.
   But Montgomery said, ``My greatest fear is that short-term
financial gain may overrun considerations of the native plants and
animals as a driving force behind management decisions,'' he said.

   When Discovery glides to Earth after
its mission to set loose the Hubble Space Telescope, the shuttle
will be testing new brakes that could pave the way for Kennedy
Space Center landings.
   Discovery is scheduled to touch down Sunday at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., where most of the 34 previous shuttle missions have
ended over the past nine years.
   It will take about a week and $1 million to return Discovery to
Kennedy Space Center, where it will be prepared for its next flight
in October. If this cross-country trip could be avoided in the
future, it would diminish the turnaround time for shuttle flights.
   The new carbon brakes, believed to slow shuttles quicker, are
``a stepping stone toward the program's desires to one day be able
to at least plan on Kennedy landings again,'' said Discovery
commander Loren J. Shriver.
   ``Whether they're done routinely or not, that will be a subject
of many, many meetings,'' Shriver said in an interview prior to the
mission.
   Kennedy's three-mile-long concrete runway provides considerably
less room for maneuvering than the 44-square-mile lakebed at
Edwards Air Force Base.
   The desert lakebed has eight designated runways up to 7{ miles
in length. A concrete runway stretches 2.8 miles, but extends onto
the natural clay surface of the lakebed.
   Twenty-seven shuttle landing occurred at Edwards. In 1982,
Columbia was diverted to White Sands, N.M., because the normally
dry lakebed was flooded.
   Five shuttle flights ended at Kennedy, the last one in April
1985. In that flight, Discovery suffered extensive brake damage and
blew a tire. During the investigation that followed the Jan. 28,
1986 Challenger explosion, astronauts voiced concern over further
Kennedy landings.
   The new carbon brakes, used for years by passenger planes, can
withstand longer braking distances and higher braking temperatures
than the older carbon-lined beryllium brakes. They also can be
applied at higher landing speeds and are good for 50 touchdowns,
compared to six or so for the beryllium brakes.
   Until the beryllium brakes were modified in the late 1980s, ``we
used to find chunks of brakes on the runway,'' said Karen Corne, a
NASA engineer who helped install the new brakes on Discovery in
December.
   After Discovery lands, the brakes will be sent for analysis to
B.F. Goodrich, their Ohio designer.
   ``Hopefully, we'll get to the point so we can just inspect them
on landing, leave them on .. just put new wheels and tires on and
fly again,'' Corne said.
   The brakes are similar in size and design, although the carbon
brakes weigh 182 pounds each, 30 pounds more than the beryllium
ones. The carbon brakes have an additional rotor and stator, and
the axles are wider and stiffer to minimize tire wear.
   Shriver and Discovery pilot Charles Bolden Jr. flew simulators
to get a feel for the new brakes a few months ago at Ames-Dryden
Flight Research Facility at Edwards. They liked them better.
   ``I have a pickup truck and in the morning, the first time you
drive it, you pull out of the driveway and you ease on the brakes
and it wrrrrrrk, it just kind of grabs until it's ready,'' Bolden
said. ``The carbon brakes, they don't grab.''
   Discovery was the first shuttle to be modified for the new
brakes.
   Depending on the results of the landing and another Discovery
landing to be attempted on a concrete Edwards runway in October,
Atlantis will be modified in 1991, followed by Columbia. NASA's
newest shuttle, Endeavor, will have the carbon brakes when it comes
on line next year.
   NASA will be shooting for one out of every two or three landings
at Kennedy starting in late 1991. Central Florida's temperamental
weather, however, is expected to be a determining factor.
   ``The weather can be perfectly good one minute and 15 minutes
later, it's disastrous,'' Bolden said.
   Bolden ought to know. On his only other shuttle flight, in
January 1986, the crew tried to land at Kennedy for three days but
had to settle for Edwards. Two other, earlier flights also were
moved from Kennedy to Edwards.
   ``The weather just didn't cooperate,'' Bolden said. ``The
program will just have to live with that as we go along.''

   AIDS had no name in 1981. But that year the virus
that causes the disease was present in blood Matsuko Gaffney
received in a transfusion at a Naval hospital.
   In time the disease killed her and her son and infected her
husband, a Marine officer, and a federal judge ruled Thursday that
government negligence was to blame.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel found that Mrs. Gaffney had to
have the transfusion because doctors failed to perform a caesarean
section when she was two weeks late in delivering her first child
in September 1981.
   Though AIDS was unknown at the time, Zobel ruled that
``infection with a communicable disease was a foreseeable
consequence of administering blood to a patient even in 1981.''
AIDS was identified as a disease in September 1982.
   Zobel's ruling lets Chief Warrant Officer Martin Gaffney seek
compensation from the federal government. The judge ordered a
second trial to determine damages for Gaffney and his daughter,
Maureene, on whose behalf the government was sued for $55 million
two years ago.
   Maureene, who is 6, is the only family member not infected by
the virus.
   Gaffney's lawsuit claimed Dr. John Yeast, an obstetrician at the
Long Beach Naval Hospital in California, mishandled Mrs. Gaffney's
pregnancy by failing to perform a caesarean section when the birth
was overdue.
   The baby eventually was stillborn and Mrs. Gaffney became
infected and lost blood. It was then she received the contaminated
blood.
   Gaffney, 40, who is still in good health and working at the
South Weymouth Naval Air Station about 15 miles south of Boston,
said he never doubted Zobel would rule in his favor.
   ``I'm just surprised it took this long for the decision. It's
obviously very good news,'' Gaffney said. ``I just wish my wife had
heard this before she left this world.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Marianne Bowler, who represented the
government in the case, did not return requests for comment. Susan
Hicks Spurlock, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office,
refused to comment while the second trial is pending.
   Navy Lt. Bruce Williams, a spokesman at the Pentagon, said the
Navy could not comment on the ruling until the judge's decision had
been reviewed.
   The Long Beach Naval Hospital no longer has an obstetrics
department and the doctor named in the case could not be located
Thursday.
   Nearly two years after the transfusion, Mrs. Gaffney gave birth
to Maureene and, two years after that, to a boy, John.
   Within a few months of his birth in July 1985, John became
sickly and in May the following year he was diagnosed as having
AIDS. The rest of the family was then tested for the deadly virus.
The parents proved to be carrying the virus, but Maureene was not.
   John died of AIDS in August 1986 at the age of 13 months. His
mother, a Japanese citizen, was 38 when she died less than a year
later, in May 1987. The couple had been married seven years.
   The Navy discovered the blood was tainted by the AIDS virus
after tracing the two donors for Mrs. Gaffney's transfusion. One
donor tested negative. The other refused to be tested and it was
learned he had been discharged from the Navy for homosexual
activity.

   A college professor who claimed he was
roughed up by a police officer during an arrest for failing to pay
a $2 parking ticket won a $10,000 settlement from the town.
   William A. Rust filed a lawsuit in federal court in Boston in
1986, charging the officer violated his civil rights in the May
1983 arrest. Rust said a wrist injury he had suffered was
aggravated by the officer's unnecessary use of force.
   ``I have no criminal record. I wasn't a threat to law and order
and I certainly wasn't going to leave town,'' Rust said this week.
   Rust, a professor of politics at Framingham State College who
has lived in Shrewsbury for 24 years, was arrested at his home
after he failed to pay a 1981 parking ticket for violation of a
parking ban on his street.
   Town Counsel T. Philip Leader said Rust had been notified
several times that he was in default. Rust's attorney, Stewart
Herrick, denied his client had been advised.
   ``I think it's an awful miscarriage of justice that he got
$10,000,'' said Shrewsbury Police Chief Robert McGinley. The
settlement was paid by the town's insurance company.
   Herrick countered, ``Certainly there must be more important
things for the police to concern themselves with, or Shrewsbury
must be an awfully peaceful little town.''

<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari told Vice
President Dan Quayle new rules are needed in the war on drugs
following the abduction of a Mexican who was taken to the United
States to face charges in the torture-slaying of a drug agent.
   Salinas ``indicated he would like to establish new rules of
understanding between Mexico and the United States on drug
cooperation,'' Quayle said after meeting with the president on
Thursday.
   Mexico has accused the United States of having a role in the
abduction of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, who now is awaiting
trial in Los Angeles in the 1985 torture and murder of a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent.
   The incident caused intense controversy in Mexico and created
resentment in the Salinas administration, which had boosted
cooperation with the United States in fighting drug trafficking.
   A Bush administration official told reporters Salinas wants
provisions for better advance notice of U.S. drug operations that
involve Mexico and a better system of information sharing.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Quayle
told the Mexican president that ``he thought we already were
sharing information.''
   The meeting was Quayle's final stop in a trip to ease Latin
American hard feelings over December's U.S. invasion of Panama.
Quayle's third Latin American swing since January ``completes the
mission,'' said the vice president's press secretary, David
Beckwith.
   Quayle on Wednesday attended the inauguration of Nicaraguan
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and delivered the first
installment of a $24 million U.S. food aid package.
   The vice president said he and Salinas also discussed
U.S.-Mexico trade relations and the situation in Central America
following Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration.
   Mexico claims the seizure of Alvarez Machain violated its
sovereignty, and Salinas said Monday in Los Angeles the incident
threatened the international drug-fighting effort.
   ``This runs the risk of creating illegal habits among those who
have the obligation of defending the law and could create a problem
much larger than the one we are trying to combat,'' he said at the
annual luncheon of The Associated Press.
   Quayle on Thursday reiterated the U.S. position that DEA agents
in Mexico were not involved, as claimed by the Mexican government.
   The DEA has denied published reports that agents in the United
States offered a bounty for Alvarez Machain's delivery. Quayle said
U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh was still investigating.
   Alvarez Machain's lawyer has said DEA agents met a plane
carrying Alvarez Machain at the airport in El Paso, Texas, on April
3, after he was abducted from his office in Guadalajara.
   Alvarez Machain is charged with reviving DEA agent Enrique
Camarena after torture sessions so he could face more questioning.
   The Mexican attorney general's office has also been conducting
an investigation into the abduction case, and published reports
Thursday said six people had been arrested, including four members
of the Mexican federal judicial police.
   Mexico has sentenced two drug lords and more than 20 others to
long prison terms in the Camarena killing, but Alvarez Machain was
never charged.
   The Salinas administration has greatly expanded the fight
against drug trafficking and corruption in Mexico, seizing more
cocaine in one year than had been seized in the previous decade.
   Salinas wants to reduce the drug issue's role as an irritant to
U.S.-Mexico relations and focus on trade and commercial ties to
revive Mexico's economy.
   However, the Alvarez Machain case brought domestic criticism
that he is insufficiently concerned with Mexico's national
integrity.

<HEAD>Senate Committee Approves Line-Item Veto Measures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president would be able to reduce or veto
outright individual items within money bills under proposed
constitutional amendments approved by the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
   ``Forty-three states give similar authority to their governors
and I think it is time to have that at the federal level,'' Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., one of the sponsors, said after the measures
won 8-6 approval Thursday.
   The committee's action, which came one day after President Bush
renewed his call for line-item veto powers, set the stage for
Senate floor action.
   Senate approval would send the proposals to the House. Approval
there would put the issue before the nation's state legislatures.
   Bush told a White House ceremony on Wednesday that the
``president needs the power to make the tough calls on spending,
take the heat and I'm perfectly prepared to do that.'' He urged
speedy approval.
   Lawmakers, seldom enthusiastic about sharing the power of the
purse, have been killing line-item veto proposals for more than a
century. Simon's office said the Library of Congress reported that
nothing similar had emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee
since April 21, 1884.
   Voting in favor of the measure were six Republicans plus Simon
and Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala. Six Democrats voted against the
measure.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, usually a critic of the concept, voted
to send the measures to the Senate floor, saying their importance
merited a decision by the full Senate. But he said he would be an
opponent if a floor debate developed.
   Simon's version, co-sponsored by Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill.,
would give the president his choice of reducing or eliminating
altogether individual line items in money bills. A simple majority
in both houses of Congress could override the president's veto.
   The other version, sponsored by Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
would empower the president to veto line items but not reduce them.
Overriding his action would take a two-thirds vote of both houses.
   Simon's version was similar to a provision in the Illinois state
Constitution.

<HEAD>US Allows Saudi Arabia to Lease Supercomputers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States is allowing Saudi Arabia to
lease two supercomputers but so far refuses to let Israel buy the
same machines, according to industry and government officials.
   The computers have been leased to the government-owned Saudi
Arabian Oil Co. to help increase the production of its oil wells.
   One of the supercomputers, a CRAY-2, was installed at the Saudi
Arabian Oil computer center in the town of Dhahran late last year,
according to the machine's manufacturer, CRAY Research of
Minneapolis. The oil company already has one other supercomputer,
an IBM model, a U.S. official said.
   An Israeli newspaper reported Thursday that Iraq had tapped into
the Saudi computer to conduct sophisticated calculations for its
missile development program. But U.S. officials said they could not
confirm the report.
   A spokeswoman at Cray said each computer includes a
sophisticated security system designed to prevent unauthorized use
of the machine, including secret access codes and other devices.
The spokeswoman, Kate Neessen, also said such lease deals include
government-to-government pledges that the supercomputers would only
be used for peaceful purposes.
   Another source familiar with the CRAY-2s said buyers undertake
to prevent remote access to the computer so that only authorized
personnel at the site can use it.
   The Saudi CRAY is being used to simulate conditions in
underground oil reservoirs and compute the wells' capacity. ``These
simulation models are highly complex, and Saudi Arabia's oil fields
are the largest in the world,'' said a statement issued by Cray.
   The Saudi oil company already has one other supercomputer, an
IBM model, a U.S. official said.
   Israel has applied for licenses to buy four supercomputers,
CRAY-2s and IBMs, but its requests have been pending for as long as
two years or more, according to U.S. officials. Two of the machines
would go to universities, one to the Weizman Institute of Science
and another to Israel's Military Industries, according to American
sources.
   U.S. government agencies considering the requests are concerned
that Israel could use the computers to improve its nuclear and
missile arsenals.
   ``With the Saudis we don't have the same kinds of concerns,''
said one government official. ``They have no nuclear use for the
machines; they are very far away from any nuclear capability,'' he
added.
   This source and others who discussed the issue spoke on
condition that they not be identified. The Commerce Department,
which by law must license all supercomputer exports, does not
comment on such sales.
   Also, Saudi Arabia has signed the international nuclear
non-proliferation agreement, which Israel has not, another official
said.
   The leases with Saudi Arabia were not considered controversial
and received almost automatic approval from the Commerce
Department, one official said.
   But the requests from Israel, as well as pending license
applications from India and Brazil, are under review by an
inter-agency committee that deals with licensing for countries with
nuclear capabilities.
   U.S. officials are willing to sell India a supercomputer for a
research institute but only on condition that the Indians allow
outside inspections and follow other security guidelines. India
already has one supercomputer that is used to forecast monsoons.
   Supercomputers are simply much larger and faster than normal
computers, able to tackle in hours problems that might take weeks
or months to run on a normal computer.
   Such problems include the complicated calculations necessary for
designing nuclear weapons, breaking codes, predicting the behavior
of oil reservoirs and forecasting the weather.

<HEAD>Link Between Disease, Diet Supplement Maker Found in Four States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers in four states suspect that dietary
supplement L-tryptophan from a single Japanese manufacturer caused
the outbreak of a rare, sometimes deadly blood disorder, but the
hunt for a contaminant continues.
   Scientists in South Carolina, New York, Oregon and Minnesota
reported many of their states' cases of eosinophilia-myalgia
syndrome, or EMS, occurred after patients took L-tryptophan made by
the Japanese company.
   The fact that a single manufacturer has been implicated in the
EMS outbreak means the likely cause of the illness is a product
contamination, and not the supplement itself, said Dr. Ed
Kilbourne, an EMS specialist for the national Centers for Disease
Control. But researchers still don't know what sort of contaminant
might be responsible or how it got there.
   ``The L-tryptophan use that's causing people to get ill is
virtually universally from one particular company,'' Kilbourne said
Thursday.
   The Food and Drug Administration recalled L-tryptophan earlier
this year after it was linked to the painful blood disorder that
has struck 1,500 Americans. Twenty-one EMS patients have died.
   South Carolina and New York researchers reported their findings
Thursday during two days of meeting at the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta. Epidemiologists from Oregon and Minnesota
reported similar findings Wednesday. The CDC has refused to name
which of several Japanese L-tryptophan manufacturers produced the
suspect product.
   ``There are still a number of ongoing investigations which are
not yet complete,'' Kilbourne said. ``This is still a very
complicated investigation.''
   But the Showa Denko Co., one of Japan's largest chemical
manufacturers, said in a statement Thursday that studies ``show a
statistically significant association between our bulk L-tryptophan
and the outbreak last fall'' of EMS. Showa Denko has been named in
at least one lawsuit from an EMS patient, a $20 million claim from
an Oregon woman.
   ``Although the precise cause of EMS has not been identified, we
are pleased that progress has been made toward solving the medical
mystery,'' Koji Yanai, president of Showa Denko America, said in
the statement. ``We will continue to cooperate with state and
federal health authorities and independent researchers with the
goal of finding the precise cause and treatment of EMS.''
   L-tryptophan is taken for excess weight, sleeplessness and
depression. Before its recall by the Food and Drug Administration,
it was widely sold in health food stores.
   The blood disorder is marked by severe muscle and joint pain,
breathing difficulties, swelling of the arms and legs, skin rash,
fatigue, cough and sometimes fever. In some cases, victims show
signs of congestive heart failure and develop a condition that
causes progressive weakness and sometimes leads to paralysis.

<HEAD>Senate Budget Panel Rejects Bid to Cut Social Security Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A politically sensitive proposal to cut Social
Security taxes failed its first formal congressional test.
   The Democratic-run Senate Budget Committee voted 17-6 Thursday
against endorsing a plan that would slash the retirement program's
payroll tax by $36.5 billion next year.
   The vote was non-binding, but it provided the first sounding of
lawmakers' attitudes toward an idea that has been in the spotlight
since its introduction last December by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   The tally came as the Budget Committee remained stalled in its
efforts to craft a $1.2 trillion budget for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. The panel rejected five deficit-cutting plans
containing savings ranging from $43 billion to $56.5 billion.
   Across the Capitol, the House debated its own $1.24 trillion
budget for next year, which provides less for defense and more for
domestic programs than President Bush prefers. Final House approval
of the Democratic-written plan is expected Tuesday.
   The House rejected two Republican-sponsored alternatives. A
proposal by Rep. John Kasich of Ohio to freeze military and
domestic spending at current levels lost, 305-106. A plan by Rep.
William Dannemeyer of California featuring the use of gold-backed
bonds to reduce the government's debt costs was defeated, 354-48.
   Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee, said he expected his panel to adopt a budget next week
that would slash the deficit by about $40 billion. The Gramm-Rudman
law requires at least $37 billion in deficit-reduction in the
upcoming fiscal year.
   ``I'm not discouraged at all,'' Sasser said after Thursday's
repeated ``no'' votes.
   The Social Security tax cut proposal, offered by Sen. Ernest
Hollings, D-S.C., was virtually identical to the bill introduced by
Moynihan.
   Moynihan advanced the idea as a way of shrinking annual Social
Security surpluses, which he says mask the true size of the budget
deficit. He says the tax hits low- and middle-income people the
hardest because it applies to only the first $51,300 of annual
wages.
   Moynihan's plan ignited political warfare. The White House
accused Democrats of using it as an excuse to eventually reduce
Social Security benefits. Some Democrats hailed it as their party's
own tax-cut plan, while others complained that the proposal would
balloon the deficit even further.
   Nine Democrats and eight Republicans voted against Hollings'
measure, while four Democrats and two Republicans supported it.
   The provision would have lowered the 6.2 percent payroll tax to
5.1 percent next Jan. 1. The tax is paid by both wage earners and
employers. A family with an income of $32,000 would save $400 a
year.
   The Budget Committee's Democrats were split over each of the
five deficit-cutting plans. Passage was impossible because GOP
senators voted solidly against the proposals. Republicans say
congressional negotiations with the White House are the only way to
concoct money-saving measures that have a chance of becoming law.
   All the Democratic plans relied more on defense cuts and tax
collections than Bush wants. They also surpassed the $37 billion in
deficit reduction the president proposed in January.

<HEAD>Fake Pictographs for Oliver Stone Film Won't Come Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEEDLES, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moviemakers defaced a limestone cavern in
the Mojave Desert by painting fake Indian pictographs on the rock
for a scene in an Oliver Stone film on singer Jim Morrison, park
rangers said.
   State officials had allowed Stone to shoot part of his film,
``The Doors'' at Mitchell Caverns Natural Preserve in the
Providence Mountains State Recreation Area.
   The artists were required to paint the pictographs using a
powdery substance they said could be vacuumed off the walls. But
someone used water in the process, causing the substance to seep
into the limestone.
   The problem was discovered when the film company tried to vacuum
the designs after the filming in March and failed, said Steven
Hansen, chief ranger for the state park system's Mojave River
District.
   ``This is absolutely criminal,'' said Elden Hughes of the Sierra
Club. ``This shows total disrespect for a tremendous and rare
resource.''
   Producers of ``The Doors,'' which comes from the name of the
late Morrison's rock group, said they contacted art restoration
experts and specialists at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu to
tackle the problem.
   ``This is something we are very concerned with,'' said Alex Ho,
producer of ``The Doors.'' The film company ``will spare no expense
to remove the symbols, but experts are few and far between. We are
making every effort to solve this problem.''
   Mitchell Caverns, about 35 miles west of Needles, is known for
its spectacular stalagmite, stalactite and other mineral formations
created several million years ago.
   For 500 years, the caves were used by the Chemehuevi Indians for
shelter and ceremonial purposes.
   ``The whole cave site was part of the initiation process for the
shamans,'' said Scott Simons, president of the Mojave Desert
chapter of the Sierra Club. ``This is like taking a can of spray
paint into a cathedral.''
   Hansen said Stone applied in February for permission to shoot a
scene in the largest cavern, the 250-foot-long Tecopa Cave. Actor
Val Kilmer, portraying Morrison, wanders about the cave in a
hallucinatory state and meets a holy man.
   The scene calls for Morrison to study Indian pictographs on the
cave walls, which the Academy Award-winning Stone had to create.
About 100 stick figures and other Indian symbols were drawn on the
limestone.
   ``We're not going to rest until it's off and everyone is
happy,'' said Larry Fulton, the film's art director.

<HEAD>Seawolf Submarine Faces Pentagon, Congressional Scrutiny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seawolf attack submarine hasn't touched
the water and it is already on the defensive at the Pentagon and on
Capitol Hill.
   With Defense Secretary Dick Cheney expected to complete an
evaluation of Seawolf next month, a congressional panel added to
the siege atmosphere Thursday by detailing ``serious deficiencies''
and cost overruns in the sub's computer system.
   ``The Seawolf represents the newest generation of attack
submarines and perhaps the newest generation of waste and abuse at
the Pentagon,'' said Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of a
House Government Operations subcommittee investigating the program.
   The inquiry turned up an internal Navy memo pointing out
problems in a sophisticated computer system that runs everything
from the engine to the sub's weapons systems.
   ``Without the computer software, the Seawolf submarine is just
so much metal floating around out there,'' said Conyers.
   The probe conducted by Conyers' national security subcommittee
and the congressional General Accounting Office focused on the
BSY-2 computer system, referred to colloquially as the ``busy-two.''
   The computer is built for the Navy by the General Electric Co.
in Syracuse, N.Y. It is designed specifically for the Seawolf,
which is to be built in Groton, Conn., by General Dynamics Corp.,
and in Newport News, Va., by the Newport News Shipbuilding and
Drydock Co.
   ``It has recently come to my attention that serious deficiencies
in the busy-two software development program have been identified
by Department of Defense software experts,'' Conyers said.
``However, it is by no means clear that corrective actions have
been taken.''
   At Thursday's hearing, Navy officials in charge of Seawolf said
they were unaware of a March 19 internal Navy memo detailing
problems in the computer software. Conyers had copies of the memo,
but did not make them publicly available.
   The Navy's top acquisition official, Assistant Secretary Gerald
A. Cann, said he would respond to the memo as soon as it could be
studied. But he said there was little risk that any technical
problems would significantly delay delivery of the system to
Groton, where the first Seawolf is under construction.
   ``I don't think we have a flaming disaster here,'' Cann said.
   GE spokesman George Jamison said it was inappropriate to comment
on an internal Navy memo.
   According to Conyers, the memo listed a number of problems
including the Navy's failure to program all of the computers'
complex function in a single computer ``language'' developed for
sophisticated weaponry.
   The BSY-2 is specifically designed to enable Seawolf to detect
and locate targets faster than existing submarine combat systems
and to allow operators to detect and attack multiple targets.
   Frank Conahan, who headed the GAO investigation of Seawolf,
called the BSY-2 system ``one of the most technically challenging
and complex software development efforts ever undertaken for a
submarine.''
   The Navy has no alternative to the BSY-2 system under
consideration, Conahan said, and problems in development of the
computer could lead to costly delays in completion of the
submarines.
   Rep. Frank Horton, R-N.Y., the ranking Republican on the
subcommittee, noted there has already been a $140 million cost
overrun in completion of the first two BSY-2 systems.
   Pending congressional approval, the Navy plans to buy 29
Seawolfs by the year 2000 at an estimated cost of $44 billion. GE
was awarded a $1.8 billion contract to develop the BSY-2 in 1988.
Assuming the entire run of submarines is built, the computer
equipment alone would account for $7.4 billion of the cost, Conahan
said.
   Conyers said it is far more likely that the pressure to reduce
defense spending will scale down the size of the Seawolf program
significantly.

   Bob Margulies doesn't believe in cloaks and
daggers, midnight break-ins or bugging. He's a spy by another name
_ manager of competitive assessment.
   Margulies uses computer know-how and industry smarts as the
chief snoop for McDonnell Douglas Corp. in Long Beach, Calif. He
probes the competition with legal methods.
   ``In our business, when you launch a new design, they're so
expensive that you're really betting the farm,'' Margulies said
Thursday. ``So if you make a mistake, you don't have a second
chance.''
   As recently as a few years ago, most American corporations were
satisfied to concentrate on researching their own markets and
customers. But many are finding that knowing the competition
thoroughly can help a company capitalize on its own strengths,
shore up weaknesses, take advantage of opportunities and counter
threats.
   Enter Margulies, and hundreds of other corporate spies who have
banded together to form the Society of Competitor Intelligence
Professionals _ written code of ethics and all.
   ``It's clearly a profession whose time has come,'' said Jan P.
Herring, a CIA analyst for 20 years, until 1983. ``What has caused
it to happen is competition, particularly among American companies
that for the first time are experiencing both international and
corporate competition.''
   Herring is vice president of The Futures Group in Glastonbury,
Conn., a consulting company that helps corporations design, develop
and operate their own intelligence organizations.
   He was on hand Thursday for the annual meeting of the
4-year-old, 1,400-member society.
   In Japan, corporate spying is an old and respected custom,
Herring said.
   ``The Japanese are the professionals,'' he said. ``They're the
ones who started it. They do it almost second nature. It's just
part of their companies.''
   Margulies, new president of the society, said the Japanese
``have honed their techniques for gathering and analyzing
information to the point where they play it like an instrument like
a professional musician.''
   Corporate spying, unlike its notorious relative _ industrial
espionage _ is an honorable business, Margulies said.
   Corporate spies don't try to ferret out confidential information
or bug meetings in their rivals' offices. Rather, they rely on
public information and interviews with experts.
   ``It is not glamorous work,'' said Margulies. ``It is pure,
unadulterated research _ collecting data, interpreting that data
and communicating to your management or customer.''
   The information explosion of the past decade, fueled by more
powerful computers and a proliferation of data banks and
specialized publications, has enabled corporate spies to find out
almost anything they want about competitors.
   Advanced degrees and computer expertise are the new cloaks and
daggers.
   ``Ninety-five percent of what you need is readily accessible.
That additional five percent that you can't get legally is not
going to help you that much. So why throw your career down the
drain? Why embarrass your company. It's a no-no,'' Margulies said.
   Margulies estimated that more than 10,000 people work in
competitor intelligence for hundreds of companies, many of them in
marketing, strategic planning or financial departments.
   Those who are good at it are precious, Herring said.
   ``A good intelligence analyst ... pulls together the pieces of
the puzzle,'' he said. ``You'll never get all the pieces. You may
sometimes get 70 percent. But he can see the picture. When you find
those kinds of people, they're real jewels.''

<HEAD>Administration: Ban on `Saturday Night Specials' Would Harm
Citizens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration argues that extending
a ban on imported ``Saturday night specials'' to domestic arms
manufacturers would deprive some Americans of the ability to defend
themselves with handguns.
   Assistant Attorney General S.G. Dennis Jr. told the House
Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on crime Thursday that a total
ban on the handguns commonly known as ``Saturday night specials''
would ``deprive citizens who do not already own a handgun of their
ability to obtain one suitable for self-defense but not for
sporting purposes.''
   Gun control opponents paint the attempt to outlaw small, cheaply
made handguns as a class and racial issue because poor people,
especially blacks, are more often the victims of crime and
inadequate police protection.
   But the committee's chairman, William J. Hughes, D-N.J., and
other Democrats said it was hypocritical to ban imports and not
domestic versions of the weapons.

<HEAD>Rehnquist Rejects Seabrook Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A final appeal to delay start-up of the
Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant has been turned aside by Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist.
   The decision Thursday clears the way for the reactor to begin
routine operations.
   Without comment, Rehnquist rejected a bid by opponents of the
plant to hold up operation until a lower-level federal appeal can
be heard next September.
   ``We and the other (opponents) continue to have very serious
concerns about the operation of that plant and that's why we could
not in good conscience go ahead without exhausting every legal
remedy available,'' said Mary Breslauer, a spokesman for
Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon, who is leading the
anti-Seabrook forces.
   Plant spokesman Ron Sher said the Seabrook reactor is currently
being operated at 8 percent power and the power plant is on the
verge of producing its first commercial electricity, more than two
decades after it was first conceived.
   ``That will be the most significant milestone in Seabrook
station's history,'' Sher said. ``That will mark the first time
that Seabrook's electricity will be traveling through the power
lines of New England to homes and businesses and industries.''

   Seven weeks after leading his leftist
guerrillas into the political system, presidential candidate Carlos
Pizarro died the violent death he long eluded as an insurgent.
   Pizarro was on a campaign trip when he was assassinated aboard a
crowded jetliner in flight Thursday.
   He completed a peace settlement with the government on March 8,
and in a dramatic ceremony members of his April 19 Movement
guerrilla group surrendered their weapons to international
observers.
   Mortars, machine guns, assault rifles and pistols were stacked
in a huge pile and hauled off to a forge to be melted down for a
peace monument.
   The government pardoned the guerrillas and allowed the country's
most notorious guerrilla group, also known as M-19, to become a
political party. Pizarro was its candidate for the May 27
presidential elections.
   He was murdered before the monument could be made and before he
could test democracy's promise of a better future.
   Pizarro, 38, was from an upper-class family, the son of a navy
admiral. But he came to believe Colombia's rigid political system
could only be changed through violence.
   He was a handsome man, standing a trim 5-foot-10, fair-skinned,
with dark, curly hair cropped short and a mustache. He had a sharp
jaw that he thrust forward in defiance when he was angry. His hobby
was guns.
   Pizarro, who never married, joined M-19 in 1974. The April 19
Movement took its name from the date of a presidential election
that Pizarro and other university students said was fraudulent.
   The group started off with high spirits and high adventure. The
rebels stole the sword of Latin American liberator Simon Bolivar
from a Bogota museum. It has yet to be returned.
   Pizarro and friends hijacked milk trucks, took them to poor
neighborhoods and distributed the milk to people who thronged
around them, cheering and clapping the rebels on the back.
   The emboldened group then began to kidnap people, hijack planes
and raid small towns to rob banks. It blew up police stations and
ransacked stores for supplies.
   M-19's bloodiest operation came on Nov. 6, 1985, when about
three dozen rebels seized the Palace of Justice in Bogota. More
than 100 people, including 11 Supreme Court justices and all the
guerrillas, were killed in fighting during the next three days.
   Pizarro became commander of M-19 in 1986, after its fifth
successive leader was killed.
   Last year, he started negotiating the peace agreement with the
government.
   After disbanding the guerrilla group last month, Pizarro changed
his combat gear for brightly colored sports coats and began
campaigning for the presidency.
   His vehement attacks on the United States ended, and his views
took a 180- degree turn.
   Fidel Castro should allow other political parties in Cuba, he
said. He applauded Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's victory in the
presidential election over leftist Sandinistas in Nicaragua.
   He also said Panama's former strongman, Gen. Manuel Noriega, now
in a Florida jail facing drug trafficking charges, got what he
deserved because of his corruption.
   Last year, in an interview with The Associated Press at his
mountain stronghold, he told of his desire to negotiate peace.
   He was asked whether he feared coming down out of the mountains
and being killed by right-wing death squads who have murdered
hundreds of leftists in Colombia.
   ``I'm willing to die for what I believe in,'' Pizarro replied.

   The dollar closed higher against the yen Friday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose moderately.
   The dollar finished the week at 159.08 yen, up 0.31 yen from
Thursday's close of 158.77 yen. After opening at 159.43 yen, the
currency ranged between 158.95 yen and 159.47 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
139.78 points Thursday, gained 160.22 points, or 0.54 percent, to
close at 29,584.80.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slipped to 85.83 points as of 3 p.m., down
from Thursday's close of 86.09. Their yield rose to 7.405 percent
from the previous day's 7.350 percent.
   Dealers said the dollar's strength reflected its rise in New
York overnight, where climbing long-term interest rates boosted the
currency. Rates on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds rose above 9
percent for the first time in almost a year.
   Dealing was more active in cross-trading involving the yen and
European currencies such as the West German mark, said Masato
Hayashi, a Bank of Tokyo dealer.
   ``Ahead of the GNP report in the United States and long holidays
here, trading will remain inactive today,'' he predicted.
   The Commerce Department is scheduled to report its initial
estimate for the U.S. gross national product later Friday.
   Trading also was quiet because of Japan's ``Golden Week'' series
of holidays, which starts Saturday and continues through May 6 for
most Japanese companies. Next week, the stock and currency markets
will only be open Tuesday and Wednesday.
   The dollar is unlikely to continue rising as investors are
inclined to sell the currency at around 159.50 yen to take profits,
Hayashi said.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese 10-year government
bonds fell to 85.88 from Thursday's close at 86.09. That boosted
their yield to 7.395 percent from 7.35 percent.

<HEAD>Tobacco Industry Denies Health Agency's Promotions Accusation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal health officials say tobacco companies
are using snappy promotions to target young people in marketing
campaigns far afield of their traditional techniques.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday more than
two-thirds of the tobacco industry's record $3.3 billion
advertising and promotion budget in 1988 went to such things as
event sponsorships and free sample giveaways.
   ``Promotional efforts differ in important ways from traditional
advertising,'' the CDC said.
   The health agency contended free samples may encourage children
to try smoking and sponsorship of sports events such as televised
tennis and racing increases children's recognition of cigarette
brands.
   But an official of The Tobacco Institute insisted that promotion
is the best way to target a shrinking smokers' market and said
accusations that the industry is targeting children are ``dead
wrong.''
   The CDC's accusations are ``a judgment call based on the
preconceived notion that the industry is attempting to recruit
underage smokers,'' said Thomas Lauria, assistant to the president
of The Tobacco Institute.
   ``The industry will fire anyone working who gives cigarettes to
kids _ that's in our code of ethics,'' he said. ``And if there are
underage people watching tennis on TV, they're watching the
tennis.''
   He also criticized the CDC for ``grazing in marketing pastures.''
   ``There's some question in my mind what the CDC is doing over in
a field far unrelated to its research,'' he said. ``I wouldn't
think of going into AIDS research and making comments based on
their numbers.''
   Citing Federal Trade Commission data, the CDC said the industry
in 1988 spent just over $1 billion on publication and sign
advertising, or 32 percent of total ad and promotion expenses,
while $2.2 billion, or 68 percent, went to promotions.
   That was a flip-flop from 1975, when $366 million, or 75
percent, was spent on advertising, and $125 million, or 25 percent,
went to promotions.

   An army of census counters has hit the streets to
fill in the blanks on some 37 million American households whose
residents have yet to be counted.
   Thousands of ``enumerators'' began their door-to-door mission
Thursday in 100 metropolitan areas nationwide. U.S. Census Bureau
officials, concerned about the response to the pavement beaters,
sought to assure people that it was safe to open doors.
   ``They're people from your neighborhood,'' said B.J. Welborn, a
spokeswoman for the Boston regional office of the U.S. Census
Bureau. ``We're trying to put a human face on the count.''
   Nearly 40 percent of more than 95 million census questionnaires
sent out in March haven't been returned, and millions more people
never received forms. The door-to-door canvassing is aimed at
filling in all those missing names.
   The next phase in the $1.3 billion census, beginning May 3, is
to take the door-to-door counting to 300 smaller communities.
   Collecting data on about 250 million Americans couldn't be
expected to be easy. But the 1990 count has been especially vexing.
   For one thing, there are more doorbells to be rung than during
the last census. Only 63 percent of households nationwide mailed
back census forms this year, 12 percent fewer than in 1980,
officials say.
   In some big cities the return rate is even lower. The Census
Bureau says only 52 percent of New York City residents returned
their census forms.
   That does not include households that never got forms: The city
said 19 percent of 2,008 residents it polled had not received
census forms in the mail.
   ``That translates to 600,000 households or 1.5 million people,''
said Hulbert James, the New York City census coordinator. ``That is
very scary to us.''
   Another potential problem will be getting and keeping enough
enumerators to finish the census, said William M. Hunt, who studies
the project for the General Accounting Office.
   ``It's going to be much tougher than the bureau thought it would
be,'' Hunt said. ``We'll have to wait and see whether the
recruitment is enough to sustain them through the process. They
tend to lose a lot of people.''
   Recruiters have been struggling in more affluent areas, like New
York's Park Avenue and California's Silicon Valley, but have gotten
more than enough applicants for counting jobs in poorer areas like
New York's East Harlem and around Kentucky coal mines, The New York
Times reported today, citing a survey of district census offices.
The jobs pay between $5 and $8 an hour.
   The 1,200 Boston area counters sworn in Thursday were looking at
a long afternoon of dancing around potholes, befriending
neighborhood dogs and knocking on doors when no one is at home.
   ``I don't like going into strange people's houses,'' said Sheila
Moretti, a mother of two and lifelong fixture in this city's
close-knit, mostly Italian North End neighborhood. ``But it helps
that I'm a familiar face. People know they can trust me.''
   But getting in the door is only half the battle.
   ``Then you have to convince people that everything we ask is
confidential,'' said Paula DeCosta, who manages a district census
office. ``We would be fined and imprisoned if we gave out any
information.''
   New immigrants, who sometimes associate the federal government
with taxes or deportation, are often among the most reluctant to
confide in badge-carrying counters.
   ``They don't know it's for their own good,'' said Yuri Quinnie
of the city's Hyde Park section. ``I didn't understand it at first
either.''
   Communities nationwide will earn their piece of the federal pie
based on the 1990 census results. Congressional representation and
federal funding for education, housing, medical and other local
needs are at stake.
   Mike Costelnik, an enumerator in Bayonne, N.J., wasn't
discouraged by getting replies from only five of the 50 households
he tried on his first day on the job.
   `It was the afternoon,'' Costelnik said. ``I can always come
back and get them tomorrow night. I am confident I will get them at
some point.''

<HEAD>OAS Supplying Contras With Food, Despite Refusal to Hand in
Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EL AMPARO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Organization of American States
has begun providing food to Contra rebels, even though the fighters
say they will keep their weapons until their Sandinista enemies
leave the military.
   The guerrillas are supposed to lay down their weapons in return
for such aid, but one OAS official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Thursday the organization fears the rebels would
resort to ``felonies'' if they go hungry.
   One rebel commander threatened that his forces would ``survive
by whatever means necessary'' if provisions were cut off.
   The rebels promised to disarm by June 10, but they have balked
over fears of retaliation by leftist Sandinistas who remain at
their posts in the police and the military.
   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro announced Wednesday she
would allow Gen. Humberto Ortega to remain a leader of the army.
Ortega is brother of former President Daniel Ortega, who led the
Sandinistas in their nine-year war against the U.S.-backed Contras.
   Mrs. Chamorro's decision has split her own U.S.-backed
coalition. On her first full day in office Thursday, two Cabinet
appointees were refusing to serve as long as Gen. Ortega remained
in place.
   A Thursday morning news conference by Mrs. Chamorro was canceled
without explanation, and she remained out of sight for most of the
day.
   Victor Jimenez, an OAS delegate providing aid to demobilize the
Contras, said more than 900 pounds of rice, corn and beans had been
delivered since the previous afternoon to rebel chiefs for
distribution among the troops.
   Jimenez spoke in an interview at the U.N.-OAS tent camp
headquarters outside the mountain hamlet of El Amparo in
north-central Nicaragua.
   In an accord signed last week, the Contras, the Sandinistas and
the new government agreed OAS aid would be provided to combatants
after they turned their weapons over to U.N. peacekeepers.
   In El Amparo, Maj. Ed Peterson of the U.N. force told
journalists that not a single Contra had turned over his weapon as
of Thursday afternoon.
   El Amparo sits in a valley in one of five internationally
monitored areas. An estimated 9,000 Contras are supposed to gather
in the designated areas in coming days.
   On Thursday, the rebels roamed the 450-square-mile area around
El Amparo at will and unsupervised. They were well armed with
Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles, grenade launchers and other
materiel.
   Under last week's accord, they were to begin handing over
weapons to U.N. forces Wednesday afternoon following Mrs.
Chamorro's inauguration.
   However, an assembly of 500 rebels on Wednesday ridiculed an
invitation from Mrs. Chamorro's delegate and U.N. and OAS
representatives to begin giving up their arms.
   The Contras say they will remain armed, mobilized and ready to
resume civil war until the army is either disbanded or overhauled
to eliminate Sandininsta control.
   ``In any case _ demobilized or not _ these people have to
continue eating,'' said Jimenez, defending the food program.
   Cmdr. ``Jimmy Leo,'' a member of the Contra general staff, and
four other commanders in the hamlet of El Destino scorned any
attempt to try to link delivery of food to the surrender of weapons.
   ``If they think they're going to condition food on the handing
over of a rifle, they can load up their food and take it back where
they got it,'' said Jimmy Leo, who spoke in an interview five miles
from the U.N.-OAS base.
   Israel Galeano, the Contras' top commander, told his troops in
an address Wednesday: ``If, for not receiving any weapons, the
international organizations pack up and leave and don't give us any
food, so be it. We will remain intact and vigilant, waiting for the
changes that have to be made.''
   Jimmy Leo said that, in the event of a cutoff of OAS supplies,
``We would consider the accords broken and would spread out
throughout the country. We're guerrillas and prepared to survive by
whatever means necessary.''

   Thousands of striking workers armed
with steel pipes and firebombs set up barricades today to keep out
18,000 riot police deployed outside the country's largest shipyard.
   Management and union officials of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co.
said there was little room for compromise. The shipyard has been
closed, and news reports quoted government sources as saying force
may be used to end the strike.
   The main dispute is the union's demand for the release of four
labor leaders arrested in earlier protests. The company maintains
that judicial matters are out of its domain.
   Last year, the government sent in 12,000 police, supported by
helicopters, to end a bitter 109-day strike at the shipyard.
Hyundai said it lost $6 million a day in last year's strike.
   The mood in Ulsan, an industrial city about 200 miles southeast
of Seoul, was tense today as riot police with shields and clubs
surrounded the huge seaside shipyard.
   About 10,000 militant workers, many of whom have occupied the
yard for three days, held a rally and burned a coffin symbolizing
the police.
   ``We have no choice but to fight,'' said one union leader
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The workers piled up ladders and other giant steel fixtures to
create a wall to seal off the shipyard's main gate. Hundreds of
workers wearing helmets and armed with steel pipes patrolled the
yard.
   News reports said police were mobilizing fire trucks,
helicopters and bulldozers to prepare for action.
   ``Police intervention appears imminent,'' the influential Chosun
Ilbo newspaper quoted a government official as saying.
   Gas and power supplies to the shipyard were cut Thursday night.
Cafeterias inside were shut down, and 4,000 management workers were
withdrawn, the company said.
   The Hyundai shipyard has about 24,000 workers on its payroll;
about 20,000 are unionized.
   The company said its shipyard is the world's largest, capable of
building 14 large ships simultaneously. Sales last year totaled
$1.5 billion. The shipyard is a subsidiary of the giant Hyundai
group, which produces cars, computers and many consumer goods.
   Negotiations between the company and the union broke down
Thursday night, and the union said there were no plans for further
talks.
   On Thursday, the government warned ``strong countermeasures''
would be taken to end what it called any ``illegal'' strikes that
are liable to increase social unrest and hurt the Korean economy,
already in a recession.
   Hyundai workers said three union leaders resigned Thursday,
charging that the union is controlled by hard-liners connected with
dissident groups fighting for political causes.
   In Seoul on Thursday night, radical students firebombed four
automobile showrooms of Hyundai Motor Co. No one was hurt, but some
windows were broken, police said.
   A major radical student group, the National Council of Student
Representatives, claimed responsibility for the attack. It pledged
to mount more protests in support of the striking Hyundai shipyard
workers.

   Survivors told of clinging to tree branches and
wading to rescue in the dark through floodwaters swollen by up to
16 inches of rain in north-central Texas.
   Storms that swept the area Wednesday and Thursday left at least
three dead. Two others, swept from their vehicle into 13-foot-deep
waters Wednesday in the Texas Panhandle, were still missing.
   No rain was forecast for the area today or Saturday.
   National Guard troops pulled people from their homes before dawn
Thursday in Brownwood, 120 miles southwest of Fort Worth, where 16
inches of rain fell overnight. About 45 people were in a shelter
there Thursday night.
   ``It was just like a lake,'' said resident Robert B. Allen. ``I
had heard the weather reports on the TV and radio, but I didn't
expect it to happen so quickly.''
   Four young children were rescued Thursday from Dry Creek in
Young County, about 100 miles west of Dallas, after the canoe they
were riding in capsized, spilling them and their father.
   Six-year-old Sarah Smith and her siblings, David, 7, James, 9,
and Karen, 10 _ all of them wearing lifejackets _ clung to branches
of trees for an hour until they were rescued, officials said. They
said the family had decided to go canoeing because the creek, as
its name suggests, is usually dry.
   Authorities evacuated up to 130 campers, many elderly people
stranded atop recreation vehicles and mobile homes, from a park in
Proctor Lake, 100 miles southwest of Fort Worth on Wednesday night.
   For rain-weary authorities in Parker County, just west of
Dallas, the flooding was the third in a series of disasters. A
twister caused widespread property damage in the area Wednesday,
when emergency officials were still trying to mop up a 4,200-gallon
oil spill into the water supply.
   Flooding also hit Galveston Island. No evacuations had been
ordered by early today, a sheriff's dispatcher said.
   A tornado ripped the roofs off two mobile homes in the Highland
area of Houston on Thursday, residents said. Some motorists were
stranded on freeways and winds overturned a tractor-trailer rig on
Interstate 10. No injuries were reported.
   In Parker County, emergency workers waited for daylight today
before resuming their effort to evacuate a private clubhous were
two dozen people were holding a party and brushed off attempts to
get them to leave Thursday, even as floodwaters from the Brazos
River lapped at the building.
   ``We can't force them to leave,'' said county Emergency
Coordinator Jo Schweikhard. ``The clubhouse is already flooded and
what it basically boils down to is there are 25 people feeling no
pain ... who are endangering themselves, the rescuers and it's a
dangerous situation.''

<TEXT>
   Japanese astronomers have produced detailed
pictures of Austin's Comet, which is heading toward the sun and
observable through telescopes in the northern hemisphere, officials
said today.
   Researchers at Tokyo University took the photographs through a
telescope at their observatory in northern Japan Wednesday night.
Details of the comet's 4.4 million-mile-long tail were clearly
visible in the photos, giving researchers a chance to study it, an
observatory official said.
   A comet's tail is essentially a vapor trail created by solar
wind striking the comet's icy surface.
   The pictures are the first of Austin's Comet taken by Japanese
researchers for astronomical observation, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The comet is named for Rodney Austin, an amateur astronomer from
New Zealand who discovered it last year.
   The comet is moving west, advancing about 3.8 million miles a
day, the observatory official said. Unlike periodical comets, such
as Halley's, he said, once this one passes the sun it will never
return.
   Austin's Comet will be observable throughout much of the Earth's
northern hemisphere until the end of May, but it is not bright
enough to be seen by the naked eye, he said.
   He said the Japanese observation effort is being conducted at 30
locations in the nation.
   Data on Austin's Comet, including photos, will be passed on to
the Smithsonian Observatory in the United States, the official said.

   It ain't the Plaza, but $20 a night is rock
bottom for this town, so budget-conscious tourists shouldn't
complain about the bunk beds.
   New York now has a youth hostel, a no-frills lodging place for
travelers of all ages in a city where the average hotel room goes
for $135 a night.
   ``We want the adventurous and people looking for fun,'' Janet
Thompson, president of American Youth Hostels, said Thursday.
   Until now, New York was the missing link in a chain of hostels
in American ports of entry, such as Seattle, Portland, Ore., San
Francisco and Miami. There are 5,366 hostels in 69 countries.
   ``I couldn't believe New York didn't have a youth hostel,'' said
City Councilwoman Carolyn Maloney. ``That was the only way I could
travel for many, many years.''
   The hostel began limited operations about two months ago and
will be in full swing in a few weeks with 480 beds.
   A typical room has three or four bunks beds, with a drawer for
each person underneath. There are six family rooms, each with one
bunk bed and one double bed.
   The hostel is in a national landmark building designed in 1883
by Richard Morris Hunt, whose only other remaining works are the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the pedestal of the Statue of
Liberty.

   Thieves posing as valet car parkers at a
popular restaurant left a Canadian police officer a few bucks on
the dashboard when they swiped his car.
   Patrick Broderick of Montreal drove his 1977 Corvette to the
Wildflower Restaurant to dine with a friend Monday night. He left
inside his clothes, $600 and his golf clubs when he turned the keys
over to three youths standing in the parking lot.
   Broderick asked them if he was dressed properly for the
restaurant, and they assured him he was. The car was discovered
missing after Broderick's companion told him the restaurant had no
valet parking.
   ``What a welcome to the city,'' police Sgt. Mike McCutcheon said
Wednesday.
   But not all was lost.
   The car was found Tuesday. The cash was gone, but the thieves
left the chagrined diner $22 on the dashboard. More importantly to
Broderick, they left his golf clubs.

   The dollar finished higher against the yen today,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange posted a moderate
gain.
   The dollar closed the week at 159.08 yen, up 0.31 yen from
Thursday's close of 158.77 yen. After opening at 159.43 yen, the
currency ranged between 158.95 yen and 159.47 yen.
   ``The dollar still holds its underlying strength, while the yen
sold against major European currencies in cross trading, causing
the yen's retreat against the dollar for the past couple of days,''
said a dealer with Sanwa Bank who spoke anonymously.
   Other dealers said the market was awaiting the release of the
U.S. Commerce Department figures on the nation's gross national
product for the first quarter of this year. The announcement was to
be made later today in Washington.
   Meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues,
which shed 139.78 points Thursday, rose 160.22 points, or 0.54
percent, to close at 29,584.80. The index gained 69.99 points at
the close of the morning session.
   Volume totaled 480 million shares on the first section, down
from Thursday's 550 million shares.
   Securities dealers said trading remained thin with many market
participants inactive ahead of long holidays in Japan.
   Yu Yoshida, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said the
market generally was held by a wait-and-see mood, but buying of
high-technology issues in the afternoon session pushed up the
index's overall level.
   Yoshida said the market environment was not necessarily good
because of the yen's decline and rising interest rates in Japan,
but added that many investors were encouraged by the fact that
there has been little effect on the market from a weekly report on
arbitrage trading.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's move to announce arbitrage trading
information on a weekly basis was taken to eliminate investors'
worries about arbitrage trading, which has been partly blamed for
the market's slump since the beginning of this year.
   In arbitrage trading, investors seek to profit from the spread
between the spot and futures marekts.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No.119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 85.83 points, down from
Thursday's close of 86.09. The yield rose to 7.405 percent from the
previous day's 7.350 percent.
   Japan's Golden Week series of holidays begins Saturday and runs
through May 6 for most Japanese companies. Next week, the stock and
currency markets will only be open Tuesday and Wednesday.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev battled critics on two fronts
during a visit to the Ural Mountains, where protesters denounced
the crackdown on Lithuania and a group of Communists quit the party.
   The president came to the industrial city of Sverdlovsk, about
870 miles east of Moscow, to make a pitch for the economic reforms
he says the Soviet Union desperately needs.
   But some residents were more concerned about events in
Lithuania. One of the pro-Lithuania demonstrators, Tatiana
Karelina, said she and other members of the political group
Democratic Union mingled among 200 people in Sverdlovsk as
Gorbachev spoke Thursday in the city's Youth Palace.
   As he was leaving the palace, a Democratic Union member unfurled
a banner that read: ``Gorbachev is a Political Hypocrite.'' A
plainclothes officer immediately grabbed the banner and tore it up,
Mrs. Karelina said in a telephone interview.
   Other banners read ``No to the Economic Blockade of Lithuania!''
   Official Soviet media carried no reports of protest, and it was
not clear whether Gorbachev saw the banners.
   The Lithuanian crisis has come up repeatedly during Gorbachev's
visit to Sverdlovsk. The Kremlin has cut off supplies to Lithuania
to pressure the Baltic republic to rescind its March 11 declaration
of independence.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl of West Germany urged Lithuania on Thursday to meet Moscow's
demands for a suspension of its independence drive.
   In a letter to Lithuanian representatives in Moscow, Mitterrand
and Kohl said Lithuanian President Vytautus Landsbergis should
rescind pro-independence laws to clear the way for talks with the
Kremlin ``so that the current crisis ends in a solution acceptable
to all parties.''
   Lithuanian parliamentary spokesman Ed Tuskenis said by telephone
from Vilnius, the republic's capital, that Landsbergis said he
would study the letter carefully.
   In Moscow, a Lithuanian man died after setting himself on fire
near the Bolshoi Theater, Soviet authorities said today.
   Police said the man, identified as Stanislovas Jamaitis, was
drunk. The independent Post-Factum news agency reported bystanders
said he had been shouting ``various things, including demands for
Lithuanian independence.''
   In Sverdlovsk, Gorbachev also faced problems within the
Communist Party, and he expressed alarm over the resignations of
local party members the day he arrived.
   In a meeting Wednesday with workers of UralMash, a gigantic
machine-building complex, Gorbachev said the party cannot be at the
forefront of reform unless it keeps in touch with the working
class. Then he broke the news about the resignations.
   ``I am greatly alarmed that today, 12 workers here gave notice
about their withdrawal from the party,'' said Gorbachev, who was
elected to the top party post in March 1985.
   ``I would look at it this way: The time now is such that some
come, and some go. I would ask ... simply that party comrades,
factory people, meet with them, to try to understand what's the
matter,'' he said.
   The remarks were not reported until Thursday. Tass did not
explain why the party members quit or whether they timed their
resignations to coincide with Gorbachev's visit.
   Foreign reporters were not allowed to accompany Gorbachev to
Sverdlovsk, which is closed to foreigners because it is a center
for defense industry.
   In advance of a Communist Party congress scheduled in July, some
members are considering splitting off to form a faction, a prospect
Gorbachev has condemned. The party this year gave up its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and decided to allow
other political parties.
   Gorbachev said the main purpose of his trip to Sverdlovsk was to
explain plans to move the centrally planned and sluggish Soviet
economy toward a market-oriented system.
   Inside the Youth Palace, Gorbachev offered reassurances that the
government will protect low-income families from some of the
expected hardships of his economic reforms.
   The reforms are expected to free prices and close inefficient
industies.
   Gorbachev said they are needed to end a ``foolish'' economic
system that stifles initiative and technological progress.
   He also discussed his finances during one of his Sverdlovsk
meetings, saying he was responding to rumors that he has a Swiss
bank account into which he deposits royalties.
   He said all his royalties, including those from a book he
published in the West about his reform program known as
perestroika, have been put into party coffers.
   ``I have deposited in the party account a million rubles (about
$1.6 million at the official exchange rate) and didn't take a
kopeck for myself,'' he said, according to a Tass dispatch.

   Rain was scattered across the Midwest and into the East today
and sections of Texas that already were soaked got another
drenching.
   Temperatures were above normal from the Great Lakes to the
Atlantic Coast. High temperature records were broken or tied at
about two dozen locations Thursday.
   Spring snow fell in high country of Colorado and Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms ranged from Minnesota across western
Wisconsin and were scattered across Iowa. Rain also spread across
western Kansas, eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana.
   Rain was scattered across Washington, Colorado, northwest
Kansas, western Nebraska, the Dakotas and eastern Montana.
Thunderstorms rumbled across southeast New York and northeastern
Pennsylvania.
   Rain in Texas added to the soaking that began in north central
sections of the state Wednesday afternoon, though much of the state
was clearing. A total of 17.5 inches of rain had fallen at Delion
since Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.
   Temperatures were well into the 80s and edged into the 90s in
sections of the Midwest and East on Thursday. A 95-degree reading
in Baltimore broke a record of 90 set in 1960.
   Snow fell in the northern and central mountains of Colorado and
the Big Horn Mountains of north central Wyoming.
   High temperature for the nation Thursday was 102 degrees at
Borrego Springs, Calif., and Palm Springs, Calif.

<HEAD>Georgia Vows to Fight Ruling of Judicial Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials said they would defend their
judicial election system that the U.S. Justice Department found
discriminates against blacks.
   But one of the 25 Superior Court judges who could lose their
jobs under the ruling warned on Thursday that defending the system
instead of changing it could devastate the courts' ability to
render justice.
   ``It would be an impossible situation,'' Superior Court Judge
David L. Cavender said. ``We need judges to hear cases. It would
have a very damaging effect.''
   The Justice Department on Wednesday declared one-third of
Georgia's Superior Court judgeships illegal because the state's
system of electing judges by districts often composed of more than
one county dilutes black voting strength.
   The ruling affects 48 sitting judges _ including 25 who would
have been up for re-election in November _ and an additional 10
judgeships created in 1989 and 1990 that never have been filled.
Georgia has 136 Superior Court judges.
   Attorney General Michael Bowers called the order ``an
unwarranted expansion of the Voting Rights Act.''
   Bowers said he believes the state will spend whatever it takes
to defend its judicial election system, even if it means putting
sitting judges out of work rather than holding new elections for
their seats.
   ``It could last for years,'' he said. ``Is it worth a million
dollars? Five million? I say yes.''
   Asked whether he would risk letting criminals loose because of
too few judges to handle cases, Bowers said, ``That would certainly
be no change from what's happening right now.''
   Gov. Joe Frank Harris' spokeswoman, Barbara Morgan, said the
governor would have no immediate comment.
   Bowers said he would put off action until a three-judge federal
panel in Savannah rules on the state's request that sitting judges
be allowed to stay in office until a federal lawsuit over the
matter is settled.
   The lawsuit challenges 48 judgeships created since 1964. It
contends that these judgeships were not first cleared by the
Justice Department, as is required under the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
   The 22 plaintiffs in the lawsuit, led by state Rep. Tyrone
Brooks of Atlanta, were jubilant in praising the Justice Department
ruling. They blasted state leaders for ``squandering the taxpayers'
money'' in defending the system.
   ``I think this makes it clear that fundamental change is going
to have to happen to have justice in Georgia,'' said plaintiff's
attorney Kathleen Wilde. ``From the sound of his (Bowers') press
conference, there is no room for negotiation.''
   The plaintiffs and their attorneys conceded that the Justice
Department action is probably only the beginning of a lengthy
battle.
   ``We've got more rounds to go, unfortunately,'' said American
Civil Liberties Union attorney Laughlin McDonald. ``It's clear that
what the state's strategy has been is to do nothing until they're
forced to comply.''
   Brooks added: ``We're headed for the Super Bowl at the Supreme
Court.''

<HEAD>Christians Close Holy Places to Protest Jewish Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAID GHAZALI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian leaders today closed the church on
the site where Jesus was buried for the first time in more than 800
years as part of a one-day strike to protest a Jewish settlement in
the old city of Jerusalem.
   Other churches and Christian shrines throughout the Holy Land
also were closed, and church bells in Jerusalem, Bethlehem and
other towns rang in somber, funeral cadence for about five minutes
every hour.
   About 150 clergymen, including representatives from nine major
Christian sects, gathered to oversee the closing of the massive
wooden doors of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, site of the
crucifixion and burial of Jesus.
   Black flags were raised, including one atop the church.
   In a show of solidarity, Moslem leaders closed to visitors the
Al Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock shrine. Only worshipers were
permitted in the complex.
   Bishop Samir Kafiti, the head of the Anglican Church in
Jerusalem, told reporters ``the settlers infringement of the
Christian Quarter where we have been for 2,000 years is a serious
matter.''
   He said an Israeli Supreme Court decision to evict the 150
Jewish settlers by Tuesday was ambiguous because the judges did not
return full control to the Greek Orthodox Church.
   The church owns the 72-room St. John's Hospice into which the
settlers moved on April 11 during Easter Week celebrations. It
claims the four-building complex was illegally leased to the
settlers.
   ``It is a half solution,'' Kafiti said, referring to the court's
decision to allow 20 guards and maintenance staff to remain in the
building pending a final ruling on the tenancy dispute.
   George Hintlian, secretary to Armenian Patriarch Torkum
Manoogian, said if the courts did not eventually rule in favor of
the Greek Orthodox Church, `stronger protests will be considered by
the heads of churches, probably longer periods of closure.''
   ``The general mood here is that we are very disappointed,'' he
said.
   The church leaders, including Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah and
Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros I, prayed inside a chapel of the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher and then read in Arabic, Armenian and
Greek ``The Lord's Prayer'' before closing the doors.
   It was a rare display of unity by the leaders of the various
sects, who frequently squabble over control of the holy sites.
   Wajih Nusseibeh, a Moslem whose family keeps the key of the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher, said it was the first time the doors
were closed since the Crusaders were driven out of the city by the
Islamic warrior Saladin in the 12th century A.D.
   The Nusseibeh and Jodeh families have been the custodians and
doorkeepers of the church for the past 1,200 years to avoid
conflicts among Christian sects.
   Outside St. John's Hospice, where the Neot David settlement was
established, about eight police and two private guards could be
seen.
   Benny Elon, a spokesman for the Jewish residents, said they had
no intention of leaving before the end of Israel's Independence Day
holiday Monday. At that point, he said, ``all the families who are
not linked to the building will leave. The 20 people representing
the company will stay.''
   Creation of the settlement triggered immediate protests from
church leaders and Palestinian Moslems and Arabs alike. The U.S.
State Department described the move as provocative, and the Greek
government also protested.
   Meanwhile, the army imposed curfews on three trouble spots in
the occupied Gaza Strip after three Palestinians were killed and
more than 120 wounded. Twelve soldiers were also hurt.
   A fourth Palestinian was killed by soldiers in the West Bank on
Thursday, at the start of the Moslem holiday of Id al-Fitr.
   The Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot decribed the clash in the
Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza as the worst since the start of the
uprising against Israeli rule more than 28 months ago.
   Maj. Gen. Natan Vilnai, head of the southern command, said
several hundred Moslems leaving the Yellow Mosque in Jabalia were
incited with calls to storm an army outpost and then ran toward it.
   Palestinian witnesses, however, said the trouble began when
soldiers at an army encampment mistook the intentions of a
procession of 4,000 Palestinians.
   They said the crowd was headed toward a cemetery to pay respects
to the dead when soldiers opened fire with tear gas. Palestinians
responded with stones and bottles.
   Thursday's deaths brought to 680 the number of Arabs killed by
Israeli gunfire in the rebellion. In addition, 209 Palestinians
have been slain by other Arabs as suspected pro-Israeli
collaborators. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Former Calif. State Senator Gets 6{-Year Prison Term For Vote
Selling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge delivered a stern
lecture on political corruption to a former powerful state senator
he sentenced to 6{ years in prison for selling votes to special
interests.
   U.S. District Judge Milton L. Schwartz told Joseph Montoya that
vote-selling was ``the most serious type of white collar crime.''
   In a brief statement before sentencing Thursday, Montoya said:
``The system has found me guilty. ... I will live with the
consequences and so will my family.''
   He lashed out at the news media, claiming reporters had ``tried
and convicted me before I even came to trial.''
   Montoya, who was chairman of the Senate Business and Professions
Committee, was the first California legislator in 35 years to be
convicted of a felony while in office. He was the first person to
stand trial on charges stemming from an FBI sting of statehouse
corruption.
   He resigned from the Senate on Feb. 9, a week after he was
convicted of one count of racketeering, one count of money
laundering and five counts of extortion.
   Montoya was convicted of demanding campaign contributions and
honorariums in exchange for votes and other legislative favors.
   Schwartz also ordered Montoya to three years' probation, fined
him $32,000, and ordered him to pay $8,000 in restitution. He said
the amounts could be reduced based on Montoya's ability to pay.
   Defense attorney Michael Sands said Montoya had been
``financially devastated'' by the case.
   Schwartz ordered Montoya to surrender by June 29. Defense
attorneys said they would appeal, and a hearing on a motion to
allow Montoya to remain free pending appeal was tentatively
scheduled for May 24.

<TEXT>
   The man whose shameful taxi etiquette earned him
the title of worst cabdriver in the city is being deported to
Turkey, according to a published report.
   Driver Vehbi Gunduz was placed Wednesday in the federal
detention center and will be returned to his native country soon,
Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Charles Troy told
the New York Post in today's editions.
   An immigration judge had ordered Gunduz to leave the country in
1985, but Gunduz kept appealing until last month, when he lost his
case, Troy said.
   It wasn't his driving record that got him in trouble, though.
Gunduz must leave because when he entered the United States he
concealed a drug conviction in Italy for which he served more than
a year in prison, Troy said.
   Gunduz began driving a cab in June 1985. In five years, he was
hit with 88 summonses and 199 violations.
   He was cited for driving recklessly, bullying passengers,
harassing dispatchers, overcharging, assaulting a taxi inspector
and dumping riders' luggage on an airport road because the
passengers only wanted to go from one terminal to another.
   The Taxi and Limousine Commission took away Gunduz's license in
October when the agency set limits on the number of violations a
driver can commit before having his license suspended. Gunduz
surrendered his license in March.
   Troy said the INS had been working on the case long before
Gunduz was fingered as the city's worst taxi driver.

<HEAD>`Accomplice,' A Comedy Thriller, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 grafs with what other critics said. No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There are enough bizarre twists and turns in
``Accomplice,'' which opened Thursday at Broadway's Richard Rodgers
Theater, to satisfy the most dedicated of contortionists.
   Unfortunately, all of them occur in the second act. It takes a
long, slow Act 1 to set the convoluted plot of Rupert Holmes' new
comedy-thriller in motion. And not much of that can be discussed
here without revealing the surprises.
   The play starts out as an awful sendup of those British theater
mysteries _ you know, the kind that run forever in London's West
End with such titles as ``Let's Murder Your Wife.'' Holmes
obviously has an affection for these hoary theatrical offerings but
his adoration doesn't translate very well on stage. At the Rodgers,
the laughs are scattered, and the chills more tepid than terrifying.
   ``Accomplice'' takes place in the moorland cottage of Derek and
Janet Taylor. He's perpetually mixing a gin and tonic. She's always
complaining about their sex life. Derek's business partner, John,
and his wife, Melinda, are expected for dinner. Any more details _
and they do accumulate _ would spoil the story.
   Holmes is something of a mystery buff and gamesman. He adapted
Charles Dickens' unfinished novel, ``The Mystery of Edwin Drood,''
as a musical. In that show, he let the audience choose the murderer
by having them vote at the end of the show.
   ``Accomplice'' is filled with similiar pranks. In fact, they
pile up, one after another, especially in the second act. Some are
ingenious; others are exasperating, mere gimmicks to kill time as
well as characters. The only thing you can be sure of in this play
is that nothing is what it seems to be.
   That puts a strain on the actors _ Jason Alexander, Pamela
Brull, Natalia Nogulich and Michael McKean. They are forever
backtracking and doubletaking, unable to give their roles any
personality. As characters, they are little more than chess pieces
to be moved wherever the author wants them to go.
   Considering the continual surprises, Art Wolff's direction is
heavy-handed. The actors hammer home the less than scintillating
laugh lines. Holmes has included a great many inside theater jokes,
yuks about show biz that will mean little to a lot of folks west of
the Hudson River.
   Designer David Jenkins' opulent country house setting is fun,
particularly a sinister, rotating wine cellar, while Alvin Colt's
garish costumes are exactly right in their awfulness.
   They complement all the empty flashiness the author has put on
the stage. Holmes has turned out more of a theater game than a
play. ``Accomplice'' is long on clever, but short of any real style
or wit.
   What other critics said:
   Frank Rich, The New York Times: ``Accomplice'' is one of those
plays ... at which the patrons must be sworn to secrecy lest the
author's surprises be ruined for future customers. Those secrets
are safe with me because I found ``Accomplice'' incomprehensible
after intermission, even though much of Act 2 is given over to
extended roundable discussions among the characters as to what has
happened or won't happen or can't happen.
   Howard Kissel, the Daily News: ``Accomplice'' spends too much
energy trying to fool the audience to be a satisfying play. It is
the work of a sorcerer's apprentice, who has read the instructions
but doesn't know that sorcery requires belief, not cynicism.
   Clive Barnes, the New York Post: As a true genre piece,
``Accomplice'' is perhaps a little too generic, with more spills
than thrills, yet it does have many good points, and audiences
determined to connive at contrivance and suspending even their
suspenders might find themselves willing accomplices to
``Accomplice.''

   The Rev. Michael W. Murphy, who in
1971 became the oldest man to be ordained as a Roman Catholic
priest, died Wednesday at the age of 98.
   A native of Michigan, Murphy had lived in Maggie Valley since
1952. In 1968, Catholic bishops and friends encouraged Murphy, then
78, to become a priest. He entered a Detroit seminary shortly
afterward.
   He returned at age 81 to be ordained a priest at St. Margaret's
Catholic Church here in 1972, and served as its pastor until his
death.
   Murphy was born on a berry farm near Detroit in 1891. He worked
with his family on the farm and later in land development after the
city absorbed the farm.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney challenged his
Capitol Hill critics today to end their ``bold talk'' about cutting
the defense budget and come up with specifics for paring the
nation's military in a time of reduced superpower tensions.
   Speaking a day after he proposed sharp reductions in the B-2
stealth bomber production and cutbacks in other major warplane
programs, Cheney said he was ``pleased with the response'' he'd
received during his testimony.
   But he also had a blunt message for those lawmakers who say he's
not cutting enough: put up or shut up.
   ``What I have heard consistently from the Congress ... is a lot
of bold talk about wanting to take down the top line on defense. I
have yet to see them deliver in terms of being willing to cut
programs, cut bases, reduce force structure to achieve those
levels,'' Cheney told reporters.
   ``It's easy to pontificate about what the overall top line ought
to be. But as soon as we get down to the real nitty-gritty of how
we're going cut the defense budget ... there's a noticeable lack of
any significant, substantive plans on Capitol Hill,'' the secretary
said.
   Asked to respond to criticism from House Armed Services Chairman
Les Aspin, D-Wis., that his program was too modest in spending
cuts, Cheney said that Aspin has had trouble in the past with
gaining enough support in his own committee to support his views,
let alone prevail on the House floor.
   He then challenged the lawmakers to come up with, and vote on, a
defense budget if they think they can improve on the
administration's plan.
   `If they've got a better plan, let em' put it out there. If
they've got the votes to change it, ... produce them,'' Cheney said.
   But the secretary predicted that the dissension on Capitol Hill
about how to revamp the military in such a time of sweeping change
_ and during an election year _ means that ``serious bargaining''
won't begin until late this fall, and that a lame-duck session of
Congress could be necessary before an agreement can be reached.
   Cheney's aircraft review calls for reducing the proposed number
of B-2 bombers from 132 to 75 and reducing the proposed purchase of
the C-17 long-range transport plane from 210 to 120.
   The defense secretary also called for cutting back on the Navy's
A-12 attack aircraft and delaying purchases of the Air Force's
Advanced Tactical Aircraft and Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, praised Cheney's efforts but declined to adopt the
proposed numbers.
   ``I don't want to commit to any specific quantities of these
weapons or the total of annual production rates until we know the
results of the testing that will occur now at a more orderly way,''
Nunn said.
   Cheney cited the lessening Soviet threat to the West and the
impact of the faltering Soviet economy on the military budget as
the rationale for the aircraft reductions.
   The proposal ``is based on an unrealistically pessimistic view
of the Soviet threat,'' Aspin said.
   And at least one Republican questioned whether likely
congressional cuts in defense spending guided Cheney's hand.
   ``What is different on the B-2 now ... that we had to have 132
three months ago and all of sudden 75 will do the job. Is it
because you think Congress is going to do it anyway?'' Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., told Cheney.
   ``If we can go from 132 to 75, I may start saying, hey, well
maybe 16 is fine,'' Lott said.
   Cheney, responding to the Democratic clamor for military cuts in
response to rapid changes in Europe, said his blueprint would trim
$2.4 billion from President Bush's $307 billion defense budget for
1991 and would save $34.8 billion through 1997.
   Cheney said he intends to cut the number of B-2 aircraft to be
purchased in the next fiscal year to two planes, from the five
currently proposed at a cost of $5.5 billion.
   The defense secretary also proposed:
   _Buying 120 of the C-17 long-range transport planes instead of
the 210 originally planned at a proposed savings of $11.9 billion
over the life of the program. The plane is designed to replace the
aging C-141 transport plane.
   _Purchasing 620 rather than the originally requested 858 of the
Navy's A-12 all-weather medium attack planes. The A-12 is designed
to replace the Navy's A-6E Intruder, which is reaching the end of
its service life as an aircraft carrier-based long-range strike jet.
   The cuts could mean elimination of two of the Navy's 14 aircraft
carrier battle groups, he said.
   _The Air Force's version of the plane, the Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, is supposed to be used for deep attack missions now
handled by the F-111 and F-15. Production of the ATA would be
delayed beyond 1997, Cheney said.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Fire Rockets Into Israeli Position in South</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas fired 20 rockets at Israeli
soldiers and detonated a roadside bomb in southern Lebanon,
wounding at least one Israeli soldier, security sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said eight
Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets were fired today at an Israeli
army position in the southern village of Kawkaba.
   ``The rockets scored direct hits on the Israeli position. A
casualty report was not immediately available,'' one source said.
   The unidentified guerrillas fired 12 Katyusha rockets at Israeli
positions in the southern Marjayoun region late Thursday and
denotated a roadside bomb as a two-vehicle Israeli patrol drove
through the adjacent Ahmadiyeh hill, the source said.
   ``The bomb exploded, inflicting damage on one of the armored
personnel carriers. One Israeli soldier was wounded and evacuated
by ambulance from the scene,'' the source added.
   He said the targets were in Israel's self-proclaimed ``security
zone'' of southern Lebanon.
   The source said the rockets were fired from truck-mouted
launchers deployed in southeast Lebanon, just north of the
6-to-10-mile security zone.
   Israel carved out the zone when it withdrew the bulk of its
invading army from southern Lebanon in the summer of 1985, ending a
three-year occupation of the predominantly Shiite Moslem region.
   The zone, which extends from the Mediterranean coast in the west
to the slopes of Mount Hermon in the east, serves as a buffer to
absorb cross-border guerrilla infiltrations into northern Israel.

<HEAD>Jews Stage Mass Reading of Sacred Text to Complete 7{ Year Cycle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH J. HARPAZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty thousand Orthodox Jews gathered in
Madison Square Garden to celebrate the end of a 7{-year cycle of
reading the Talmud, a sacred text of Jewish law handed down by the
ancient rabbis.
   ``These are not dead letters of a printed book. They are
alive,'' Rabbi Simon Schwab of Congregation K'hai Adath Jeshurun in
Manhattan told the assemblage Thursday night.
   The Talmud is believed to have been given to Moses by God at
Mount Sinai and handed down orally until the 6th century B.C., when
it was transcribed.
   It is divided into tracts on agriculture, blessings, civil law,
matters pertaining to women and families, holiness and synagogue
services, and purity, including what is kosher.
   The ancient codes and commentary have been reinterpreted and
debated through the ages to answer contemporary questions.
   ``We extend the great chain that binds us with the earlier
traditions,'' said Rabbi Chaskel Besser, chairman of the Daf Yomi
Commission of Agudath Israel, a coalition of Orthodox groups that
organized the ceremony.
   Daf Yomi means daily page. It refers to the fact that the same
page of the Talmud is studied each day by Jews everywhere. The
Talmud has 2,711 double folios, and the cycle of reading that began
in 1982 ended Thursday. The new cycle begins today.
   The written Torah is the first five books of the Old Testament;
the oral Torah is the Talmud.
   Most of the men attending the event were Hasidim, ultra-Orthodox
Jews who sport long beards, long black coats, black pants and
wide-brimmed black hats.
   The sexes are segregated during Orthodox services, so women
attending the celebration sat separately in the balcony. Most were
modestly dressed in long-sleeve blouses and skirts that fell below
the knee.
   The service was dedicated to the memory of the 6 million Jews
who died in the Holocaust.
   Daf Yomi participants include Jewish scholars as well as laymen
who spend an hour a day studying the tracts, sometimes in study
groups, sometimes squeezing the reading in with a pocket edition on
the subway. There are also cassette tapes and a recorded telephone
announcement called Dial-a-Daf to assist one's understanding of the
text.
   Women are not forbidden to study the Talmud, but in the Orthodox
tradition they usually do not.

<HEAD>ANC President Oliver Tambo Leaves Swedish Clinic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver Tambo, president of the African
National Congress, has left Sweden after a five-month recuperation
from a stroke, officials said today.
   Tambo, the longtime ANC leader, was staying at a Stockholm
clinic during the swift changes that saw his organization legalized
and his old friend, Nelson Mandela, freed from prison.
   Tambo came to Stockholm on Jan. 3 after being treated in London
for a stroke he suffered late last year.
   He returned Thursday to London without fanfare.
   The Swedish news agency TT said the exiled Tambo wanted to
return to South Africa as quickly as possible, but it was unlikely
he would be able to resume an active leadership role in the ANC.
   Senior ANC leaders are to meet the South African government next
week for talks aimed at clearing the way for formal talks on ending
white minority rule.
   Tambo reportedly gave Mandela, who was named deputy president of
the ANC, his full support as acting ANC leader when the freed
activist came to Sweden in March for a reunion of the two former
law partners.
   Mandela was released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison in South
Africa. He was jailed on charges of helping plan the start of the
ANC's guerrilla campaign against the government.
   ANC officials in Sweden were not available to comment on Tambo's
plans.

<HEAD>Soviet Fishing Trawler Seized After High-Speed Coast Guard Chase</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet trawler seized by the Coast
Guard for allegedly fishing in U.S. waters is being escorted to an
Alaskan port and is expected to arrive Sunday, officials said.
   When it arrives at Kodiak it will be charged with violating the
Magnuson Act, a 1976 law establishing the nation's 200-mile
exclusive fishing zone, said assistant U.S. attorney Tim Burgess.
   Kodiak is about 250 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The factory trawler Ilya Ilyin was seized Thursday after a
high-speed chase by the Coast Guard cutter Yocona inside the United
States' Exclusive Economic Zone northwest of the Pribilof Islands
in the Bering Sea, said Dennis Fradley, spokesman for Sen. Frank
Murkowsk, R-Alaska.
   Coast Guard surveillance aircraft spotted the trawler and the
Yocona was diverted to intercept it, according to a statement from
Coast Guard district headquarters in Juneau.
   The Coast Guard said the Yocona ordered the Soviet ship to halt,
but the vessel attempted to elude the cutter and return to
international waters.
   ``The cutter pursued the vessel at high speed for the next hour
and a half, crossing into international waters before the vessel
stopped and was boarded,'' the statement said.
   The Coast Guard told Murkowski's Washington, D.C., office they
found records providing clear evidence of illegal fishing.
   ``This one is pretty clear cut,'' said Bill Woolf, a fisheries
expert on Murkowski's staff. He said the ship was observed with its
fishing gear in the water and was believed to be fishing for
pollock.
   The United States and several other nations with high-seas
fishing fleets have clashed for years over the rich and lucrative
North Pacific fisheries. The United States has seized a number of
Canadian, Taiwanese and other vessels in the North Pacific in
recent years, but seizures of Soviet fleet fishing vessels is less
common.
   The last time the Coast Guard seized a Soviet fishing vessel in
the North Pacific was in May 1989, when the trawler Novoelnya was
captured with 940 metric tons of pollock aboard. The Soviets paid
$275,000 in fines, Burgess said.

<TEXT>
   The trial of Imelda Marcos on fraud charges was
postponed until next week today after doctors told the judge she
was suffering from high blood pressure and it would ``not be a good
idea'' for her to continue.
   Judge John F. Keenan sent the jury home, saying it was expected
that the former Philippines first lady would be able to return to
court on Monday. A hypertension specialist was called in on the
case, he said.
   ``She said she felt fine, but she didn't look fine to me,'' her
attorney, Gerald Spence, told the court after Mrs. Marcos visited
the doctor early in the day. He said she would be wearing a device
to monitor her blood pressure ``wherever she goes.''
   The trial was abruptly halted Thursday after Mrs. Marcos fell
ill during a lunch break. That morning, she had sobbed through
testimony that recalled the day in February 1986 when she and her
late husband, former president Ferdinand Marcos, were forced to
leave the Philippines following his ouster from power.
   The 60-year-old Mrs. Marcos broke down after a U.S. Customs
agent described the arrival of the Marcoses and their entourage in
Hawaii aboard a U.S. Air Force plane.
   During the lunch break, she rested at a nurse's office in the
U.S. courthouse, and then left the building after recessed the
trial for the afternoon on the advice of her doctor. Her blood
pressure was measured at 230 over 100; normal readings would be 120
over 80.
   The U.S. government charges that Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband embezzled $220 million from their country's treasury to
support a life of luxury and investments such as artwork and New
York real estate.

   Advocates of the disabled plan to picket
this weekend to protest a cruise line's refusal to allow a woman
who's confined to a wheelchair on board its ship.
   Peggy Smith of Galveston said Thursday that Pride of Mississippi
ship officials refused to let her board the 500-foot cruise ship in
her wheelchair April 13 to take a daylong cruise with her boyfriend
and several other people.
   ``It was going to be my last evening out with my boyfriend
because he was going away for a few months,'' said Ms. Smith, a
26-year-old paraplegic horse trainer and riding instructor at
Galveston's Hope Arena.
   She lost use of her legs five years ago in an accident while
exercising a horse at a California racetrack.
   Bernard Allen, a spokesman for Pride Cruise Lines, said Thursday
that passengers in wheelchairs could cause greater risks for
themselves and others in emergencies.
   ``It would create a very serious problem for the passenger and
other passengers to try to get them embarked into a lifeboat,''
Allen said.
   Salli Phillips, president of the Galveston Chapter of Coalition
for Barrier Free Living, said her group intended to picket Saturday
at the Galveston dock where the Pride of Mississippi is located.
   Galveston Mayor Barbara Crews said she has received complaints
about the incident and has asked the city attorney's office to see
if the refusal to sell tickets to people with disabilities violates
state and federal laws.

<HEAD>Red Cross Delegation Goes to Lebanon Seeking Hostages' Release</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SIDON, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Red Cross delegation arrived in this
southern provincial capital today, seeking word on the possible
release of two kidnapped Swiss Red Cross workers.
   The delegation's four members made no statement upon arriving at
the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.
   However, a committee source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the four planned to maintain ``daily presence in Sidon this
week, waiting for a contact concerning our two kidnapped
colleagues.''
   The team was led by the Red Cross chief delegate in Lebanon,
Michel Dufour, and the committee's spokeswoman for the Middle East,
Marjolaine Martin, who flew into Beirut from Geneva on Wednesday.
   ``We remain optimistic after our talks here about the release of
our two officials,'' Dufour said, without elaborating.
   The delegation is seeking the release of Red Cross orthopedic
technicians Emanuel Christen, 33, and Elio Erriquez, 24. They were
kidnapped by unidentified gunmen in Sidon on Oct. 6.
   No group claims responsibility for their seizure. However,
Lebanese and foreign security sources blame the Fatah-Revolutionary
Council group of Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal.
   The group has denied involvement and urged the captors to
release Christen and Erriquez.
   The Red Cross team held talks on Thursday with Mustafa Saad, who
heads the Sunni Moslem independent Nasserite organization whose
1,000-strong Popular Liberation Army militia dominates Sidon.
   Saad renewed his appeal for the release of the two Red Cross
workers, saying failure to free them ``will be considered a hostile
act against us.''
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, as well as Palestinian and
Lebanese groups, have appealed for the pair's release.
   In addition to the two Swiss, the Western hostages believed to
be held mainly by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon are seven
Americans, four Britons, two West Germans, an Irishman and an
Italian.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 43, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held foreign
captive in Lebanon. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>West Germany Says Cuts in Defense Would Help Pay For Unification</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today said defense
spending should be cut to help pay for German unification.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's senior aide predicted agreement on merging
the two countries' economies within a week.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, also told Parliament that
local and state governments will help pay the costs of merging the
two Germanys and said the process will be easier if citizens show
courage.
   East and West German officials today negotiated economic union,
and Seiters predicted success within a week and the merging of the
two economies by summer.
   West Germany is demanding that the East German economy be
completely overhauled. But Lothar de Maiziere, East Germany's prime
minister, said his people would face enormous burdens if subsidies
on rents, energy and public services are eliminated immediately.
   Seiters acknowledged that the cost of reviving East Germany's
economy and protecting its people from economic shocks will result
in West German budget cuts _ in defense and other areas _ and a
higher budget deficit.
   He did not specify what military cuts Bonn envisions, although
it is considering a reduction in its 490,000-member armed forces to
400,000.
   Seiters assured the lawmakers that West Germany's strong economy
can absorb much of the cost of unification and noted Kohl's promise
not to raise taxes.
   During the same session, opposition politicians accused Kohl of
excluding them from participating in the unification process.
   ``Unification is not a private matter for the federal
chancellor. It is a matter for the whole people,'' said Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin, a top official with the opposition Social
Democrats.
   West Germany and East Germany hope to adopt a single currency
and join their economies by July 2, which will be huge steps toward
ending the two countries' 41-year division.
   No details were immediately forthcoming from the negotiations in
East Berlin on Bonn's proposed ``state contract'' on the monetary,
economic and social union of the two nations.
   The proposal includes terms for replacing East Germany's
currency with the mighty West German mark, restructuring the East
German economy, and adopting social programs to protect East
Germans from resulting economic shocks.
   The Bonn proposal calls for a basic 1-1 currency exchange for
wages, pensions and savings up to $2,300. Savings over that amount
would be exchanged at the less attractive rate of 2-1.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Americans to `Get Moving' on Census</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, acknowledging huge problems
with the gathering of 1990 census data, today implored Americans
who have not returned their census forms to do so at once.
   ``We really need to get moving on this,'' Bush said in his first
comments on the poor return rate so far in the census undertaking.
   Nearly 40 percent of more than 95 million census questionnaires
sent out in March haven't been returned, and millions more people
never received forms.
   The U.S. Census Bureau this week began sending out door-to-door
census ``enumerators'' to help fill in the missing blanks.
   Bush said that, in light of the poor response, this would be a
``mammoth undertaking.''
   He made his appeal at the beginning of a talk to a group of
state legislators visiting the White House.
   ``The census data will help us make important decisions for the
states,'' Bush told the American Legislative Exchange Council.
   Census information is crucial for distributing federal funds in
a variety of programs to states and local governments.
   Accurate census data is also needed for the redrawing of
district lines for congressional and legislative seats.
   Bush called on the state legislators to help the federal
government in coaxing Americans into doing a better job of
returning their census forms, which where supposed to have been
mailed in on April 1.
   ``I want to take this opportunity to urge every American who has
not returned the census form to do so, to stand up and be
counted,'' the president said.
   It was the first time that the vexing problems plaguing the
Census Bureau has attracted official White House comment, even
though Bush has made the importance of congressional restricting a
major feature of his political speeches.
   The president has told Republican audiences to be vigilant
against what he has said will be attempts in states with
Democratic-controlled legislatures to redraw congressional and
legislative district lines to minimize GOP gains.

<TEXT>
   The trial of a brother of ousted
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was suspended today for a
month after three military judges said there was insufficient
evidence for prosecution.
   Prosecutors asked for more time to investigate Nicolae Andruta
Ceausescu, the former head of the secret police academy, who was
charged with ordering his cadets to fire on demonstrators during
the December revolution and killing seven protesters himself.
   Also today, hundreds of protesters alleging Communist
infiltration of the interim government blocked central University
Square. State radio said government supporters would stage a rally
to counter the 6-day-old protest.
   The trial of Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu was suspended until May
29 after the judges said there was insufficient evidence for a
verdict.
   Several high-ranking officers who worked under the 66-year-old
former general testified that they saw him on Dec. 21 near the
Intercontinental Hotel, where several protesters were killed.
   One witness, Maj. Nicolae Coman, said he saw Ceausescu ``at one
point standing right next to the crowd, about one meter from the
protesters ... But I could not see what was in his right hand.''
   In an earlier session on the trial, several of Coman's soldiers
testified that Ceausescu approached the crowd with his gun and
fired on demonstrators.
   Ceausescu insisted ``the whole story is untrue, staged.''
   Romania's provisional government had been criticized for the
summary trial and execution on Dec. 25 of ousted Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, for ``grave crimes'' during
his authoritarian rule.
   In March, four Ceausescu bodyguards were acquitted of charges
that they had helped him flee Bucharest during the revolution.
   Nicu and Zoia, Nicolae Ceausescu's son and daughter, are under
arrest and awaiting trial.

<HEAD>Impeached Federal Judge Could Go Back To Prison Due To Hunting
Violation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former federal judge who was
impeached and removed by Congress could face prison again, this
time for parole violations, after being arrested on charges of
baiting a field to attract wild turkeys.
   Because Walter L. Nixon Jr. is on parole for a federal perjury
conviction, possession of a firearm could be grounds for revocation
of his parole, U.S. probation officials said Thursday.
   ``He was hunting with a gun,'' said T.J. Jennings, chief
investigator for the law enforcement division of the Department of
Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.
   Federal law prohibits felons from carrying firearms. Conviction
is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Nixon, 61, and Austin Cordell Shattles, 72, were booked early
Thursday at the Jackson County Sheriff's Department and released
under $100 bond each.
   Nixon was charged with hunting game birds over a baited field,
while Shattles, a wildlife area supervisor who has been with the
department for 40 years, was charged with conspiracy to bait
turkeys, court documents show. The department said he had been
placed on leave pending review of the case.
   ``I'm just sick about this,'' Nixon said Thursday. ``It's a
terrible nightmare.'' He had no further comment.
   Both are scheduled to appear May 16 in Jackson County Justice
Court.
   The Senate convicted Nixon, 61, on two counts of making a false
or misleading statement regarding a drug case to a grand jury in
1984. It removed Nixon from his federal judgeship Nov. 3 and
stripped him of his $89,500 salary.
   He was convicted in Hattiesburg in 1986 of lying to a grand jury
by denying he had discussed a pending case with a former
prosecutor. On March 23, 1986, Nixon began serving two simultaneous
five-year prison terms and was paroled in November from a New
Orleans halfway house.

   The hydrant's leaking, and the sprinkler's
peaking. Who you gonna call? Drought busters.
   The city's Department of Water and Power said Thursday it will
dispatch a street patrol of ``drought busters'' to look for water
waste as the region enters its fourth consecutive drought year.
   The department's commissioners also voted to revive a loan
program designed to help home and apartment building owners buy
water-saving devices.
   The moves are designed to avoid the need for mandatory water
rationing, said Rick Caruso, president of the board of
commissioners.
   In addition, the board sent Mayor Tom Bradley a list of
recommendations to strengthen the city's 1978 conservation law.
Included are a ban on landscape watering during daylight and
empowering the department to turn off water at residences
responsible for repeated runoff into streets.
   Currently, only City Council can order a violator's service shut
off.
   The department will hire up to 30 drought busters to enforce
water conservation laws and work with homeowners on ways to cut
consumption, Caruso said. He acknowledged that many residents have
ignored a city ban on hosing down sidewalks and driveways.
   ``If we need to, we can add another 20 drought busters to get
the job done,'' he said.
   Under the loan program, homeowners would be eligible to borrow
$300 to $7,500, while apartment owners up to $50,000, to buy and
install water saving equipment.

   A man's decision to break his
engagement at the last minute led to a shootout that left two
people dead and four wounded, police said.
   Tempers flared and pistols were pulled when members of the two
families met Thursday night to return gifts, police said. The
wedding was to have occurred four days earlier.
   Killed in the burst of fire were two brothers, age 50 and 55,
identified as uncles of the jilted woman. A brother-in-law of the
bridegroom was reported arrested on murder charges, and at least
two other people were held for questioning.
   According to the Italian news agency ANSA, the prospective
bridegroom, 28-year-old Giuseppe Millefiori, refused to go through
with the marriage at the last minute. He was to have married
24-year-old Francesca Sanfilippo.

<HEAD>`Cry Freedom' Reopens Quietly In South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the movie ``Cry Freedom''
appeared in South Africa in 1988, it was greeted by a storm of
controversy, two bomb blasts and a police order confiscating the
film hours after it opened.
   The movie reopened Friday without fanfare.
   The film began showing at more than 40 theaters nationwide to
moderate crowds and no incidents, according to police, theater
managers and the film's distributor, United International Pictures.
   ``People have accepted changes,'' said Dave de Villiers, general
manager of Ster-Kinekor theaters in Johannesburg and surrounding
areas. ```Cry Freedom' opened like an ordinary movie, and we expect
it will do decent business. It's not a controversial blockbuster
like it was two years ago.''
   ``Cry Freedom'' is about black activist Steve Biko, who died in
police custody in 1977, and Donald Woods, a white newspaper editor
who befriended him. The movie is based on two books by Woods and
was directed by Sir Richard Attenborough.
   ``Cry Freedom'' contains the most emotional and violent scenes
involving South African police and black citizens ever shown in a
general release movie in South Africa.
   The Publications Appeals Board, the government's censorship
body, approved the film July 29, 1988, and it began showing at 30
theaters the same morning.
   The movie drew large crowds despite threats by right-wing
whites. There were two bomb blasts outside theaters where ``Cry
Freedom'' was playing, and several other theaters received bomb
threats. Seven hours after the film opened, police ordered it
confiscated, saying it ``endangers the safety of the public.''
   ``The security forces are portrayed in such a negative light (in
the movie) that their public image would be seriously undermined,''
said Stoffel van der Merwe, minister of information at the time.
   ``Whites are typified as privileged and surrounded by wealth, as
opposed to blacks living in great poverty and subjected to
exploitation and repression,'' he said.
   Van der Merwe described that portrayal as inaccurate.
   But earlier this year, police returned the film and indicated it
could be shown.
   President F.W. de Klerk, who assumed power in August, has eased
restrictions on many anti-government activities as part of an
effort to negotiate a new constitution with blacks.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
country's 5 million whites maintain political and economic control,
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.

   Taiwan has lifted a ban that prevented
Soviet business officials from visiting this island, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Huang Hsin-pi said Friday.
   Also Friday, the Government Information Office reported it would
issue a license to allow the Soviet film ``War and Peace'' to be
shown in Taiwan. It will be the first Soviet movie shown in Taiwan.
   Huang told a news conference the ban on business trips was
lifted last week to encourage trade between Taiwan and the Soviet
Union.
   Foreign Ministry officials said they have received about 10
applications and two visas have been issued allowing Soviets to
visit on business.
   In the past month, the Nationalist government also has approved
direct trade between Taiwan and the Soviet Union and Taiwanese
investments in projects in the Soviet Union.
   Trade between anti-Communist Taiwan and the Soviet Union was
conducted through third countries in the past.
   The Soviet Union has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan and
recognizes the rival Communist government in Beijing.
   The Nationalists have long considered the Soviet Union a hostile
nation and have linked their defeat in a civil war in China in 1949
to Soviet aid to Communist Chinese forces.

   Donald Trump said today he has discussed selling
or refinancing virtually every major asset he owns but it's not
because he has any cash problems.
   The casino and real estate mogul has hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
to negotiate a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle less than a year
after buying the carrier and attaching his name to it.
   ``If I got the right offer, I would consider selling it,'' Trump
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Trump was confirming remarks made to the Wall Street Journal,
which published details of his financial plans in a story today
after its own interview with him. The Journal's account said Trump
was so adamant about his cash strength he threatened to sue the
newspaper if it suggested otherwise.
   He denied that his empire faces any cash shortage problems,
saying he has cash reserves of $380 million.
   ``I'm very liquid now,'' he said. ``I want to build up cash
because I think cash is going to be king.''
   Among his assets are New York's Plaza Hotel, the glitzy Trump
Tower skyscraper on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, and casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., including the $1 billion Taj Mahal casino,
which recently opened with much fanfare.
   He said he is interested in raising cash now so that he will
have funds on hand in the future to acquire additional properties.
   The Plaza and Trump Tower will not be sold, however, Trump said.
   Some people in the financial community are watching for signs
that Trump might be accumulating cash to cope with a current or
anticipated cash crunch caused by a heavy debt load.
   Several of Trump's biggest holdings don't produce enough income
to cover interest payments on loans taken out to pay for the
acquisitions. This means that Trump relies heavily on cash cows,
such as casinos and condominiums, according to an article today in
the Wall Street Journal.
   The ``cash is king'' strategy Trump is pursuing has led him to
consider the sale of the Trump Shuttle, an airline serving New
York, Boston and Washington. When Trump acquired the carrier with
bank loans from Eastern Airlines last year for $365 million, he
said he wanted to transform it into ``one of the really fine
airlines in the world.''
   Trump said he is weighing a sale because he has been approached
by numerous parties interested in it. He declined to say whether he
is making money on the shuttle or to identify the potential buyers.
   ``We've been engaged to explore strategic alternatives for the
shuttle,'' Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said. He declined to
elaborate.

   France announced in January that it would reopen the embassy but

U.S.-backed rebel forces.
   No other major Western countries have reopened embassies in

<HEAD>Party Admits More Than 1 Million New Members in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's Communist Party admitted 1.13 million new
members in 1989, a year in which the party was challenged by a
widely popular democracy movement, the official People's Daily said
Friday.
   The party newspaper said two-thirds of the new members are under
the age of 35 and have at least high school educations.
   The report did not give the current party membership. An
official of the party Organization Department, contacted by phone,
said, ``I know but I won't tell you.''
   Figures published more than a year ago put membership at about
48 million, 4 percent of China's population.
   The party launched a review of the qualifications of all party
members following the crackdown last June of the democracy
movement. Many party members either participated in or voiced their
support for the student-led movement for democratic reform.
   So far, it appears few are being dropped from party ranks for
ideological shortcomings. The People's Daily last month said 33,400
people were expelled from the party last year for abuse of power or
other reasons, up slightly from previous years.
   The daily said there were 9.51 million pending applications by
the end of 1989, and that there were 2.32 million new applications
after the political turmoil of June.
   In deciding whether to accept someone into the party, officials
consider whether the applicant submits to the party line and party
discipline and has good moral character. They also check the
applicant's personal and family background for such things as
criminal records or accusations of political errors.
   The daily said 5.3 million of the pending applicants were
workers, farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, intellectuals and soldiers.
The other 4 million are presumably government officials, who need
party membership to advance their careers.
   Despite widespread disenchantment with the party, many young
people still see party membership as crucial to obtaining good jobs.

   A man threw eggs and shouted insults at
Iran's foreign minister in a U.N. hallway today before being
wrestled to the floor.
   The official, Ali Akbar Velayati, was not injured and the eggs
missed him.
   The unidentified man, who identified himself as an Iranian,
screamed at Velayati: ``He is a murderer and torturer! He does not
represent the Iranian people. He should not be allowed in the
United Nations.''
   The assailant was hustled away by guards, along with a second
man who stood nearby during the attack. The second man, who
identified himself as Ahmed Mohini of Iran, claimed that the
Iranian government had murdered his brother.
   Both men, who wore dark suits, said they were acting as
individual Iranians and that they were not affiliated with any
group.
   One witness said a third man ran away and was captured.
   There was no immediate statement from U.N. Security or State
Department Security, whose guards subdued the assailant.
   ``I don't know him,'' Velayati said of the attacker. ``He
chanted slogans against me and tried to attack me, but guards
prevented his doing so.''
   The attack occurred as Velayati was on his way to hold a news
conference in the Secretariat Building on the second floor. Only
two or three eggs were thrown and they landed on the marble floor.
   Velayati is in New York for discussions with U.N. chief Javier
Perez de Cuellar on reviving stalled peace talks with Iraq.
   No permanent agreement has been reached between the neighboring
Middle East countries since an Aug. 20, 1988 cease-fire halted
eight years of hostilities.

   Mongolian security forces ringed the government
palace today when thousands of people staged an unauthorized
protest, but the opposition demonstrators left peacefully after
several hours, sources in Ulan Bator said.
   It was not immediately clear whether the government had made any
concessions that led to the retreat. Most of the police and
soldiers later withdrew, one source said, although small numbers
remained posted outside the building into the night.
   It was the first direct confrontation between protesters and
security forces in five months of pro-democracy demonstrations in
Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator, and both sides seemed eager to
avoid violence. The security forces did not have weapons or riot
gear.
   The protest violated a recent government edict requiring that
all demonstrations be approved in advance.
   The largest opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic
Association, had planned to encircle the government palace to press
its demands for equal status with the ruling Communist Party and
formation of a temporary, multiparty legislature until elections.
   But police and soldiers of the internal militia formed a
protective circle first and blocked adjoining streets, said
Suhjargalmaa, an editor at Mongolia's Montsame News Agency. The
protesters formed a picket line on only one side of the palace,
fronting a large central square where supporters and onlookers
gathered.
   ``There were about 40,000 at noon but now there are much
fewer,'' Suhjargalmaa said in a telephone interview. She said the
security forces did not have weapons or riot gear, and that no
force had been used. Like most Mongolians, Suhjargalmaa uses only
one name.
   Students chanted ``Youth, unite!'' and waved national flags and
emblems of the Mongolian Democratic Association, the Soviet news
agency Tass said.
   Mongolian radio said the government was broadcasting appeals
over loudspeakers for the crowd to disperse, but protesters were
responding with shouts for the soldiers to leave.
   So far, there has been no violence since opposition groups first
emerged in December to demand democratic reforms like those
elsewhere in the Soviet bloc.
   The Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party in March surrendered
its constitutional right to rule and agreed to the first multiparty
elections in Mongolian history _ apparently believing that its best
chance of staying in power will come from embracing reforms.
   Legislative elections are tentatively scheduled for July.
   But the opposition has accused the party of cheating by amending
the election law to give more delegates to rural areas, where the
Communists are strongest. Opposition groups have demanded that this
be changed and that the Communist-dominated legislature step down
immediately. They want a provisional legislature including all
parties to oversee the elections.
   Earlier this week, the Mongolian Democratic Association set a
deadline of noon today for the government to respond to these and
other demands. Government and association officials met on
Thursday, but the opposition walked out when its demands were not
met, Suhjargalmaa said.
   Other demands included that the ruling party's Central Committee
move its offices from the government palace and that all parties be
allowed to join a commission that is investigating former
high-ranking officials. The commission was set up by the ruling
party in early April to uncover alleged abuses of power under
former dictator Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal. He was ousted in 1984, but
many of his associates remain in government and the party.
   Tass said President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat broadcast a speech on
television and radio late Thursday and early today urging the
public to resist pressure, stay calm and avoid disruptions of work.
   Public prosecutor Baljinnyam said he would implement a decree
issued by Ochirbat in early April that requires advance approval
for demonstrations and allows the government to use force,
Suhjargalmaa said.
   But she predicted the government would not use force because
that would undermine its own reform efforts.

   A strong earthquake battered the remote highlands
of central China, killing 115 people and leaving thousands
homeless, the State Seismology Bureau said Friday.
   A bureau official said 160 people were injured in Thursday's
tremor, which measured 6.9 on the Richter scale.
   China Central Television reported that the quake, centered in
the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai province, left
5,000 people homeless. Hundreds of people were sleeping on the
ground, wrapped in heavy blankets to ward off the cold of the
Qinghai high plateau.
   The news program said 500 soldiers and workers from army and
provincial hospitals were rushed to the scene. Soldiers dug through
the rubble of demolished packed-earth homes and dragged away
corpses.
   The earthquake's epicenter, about 70 miles southwest of the
provincial capital of Xining, is believed populated mainly by
Tibetan herdsmen and miners.
   Qinghai, one of China's largest and least populous provinces, is
also home to Moslem Huis, Kazakhs and Mongolians, and contains many
prisons and labor camps.
   The temblor was felt as far away as the city of Lanzhou, 186
miles to the east.
   The powerful tremor dug large cracks in roads and often left
nothing standing but wooden doors. The only house shown in the TV
tape that was not destroyed was a concrete structure with half its
wall collapsed.
   A Seismology Bureau official, who gave his name only as Zhai,
said more than 1,000 homes collapsed in the initial quake and
during more than 600 aftershocks. Some aftershocks were as strong
as 6.0 on the Richter scale.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
A quake measuring 6 can cause extensive damage in a populated area,
while one measuring 7 is 10 times stronger.
   The far western Chinese province of Xinjiang was hit by a quake
measuring 6.4 on April 19. Some 1,300 homes were damaged and two
people were injured.
   Thursday's quake was the deadliest in China since November 1988
when a temblor measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale killed 730 people
in the southwest province of Sichuan.
   The most devastating tremor in recent years in this quake-prone
nation came in 1976, when 240,000 were killed in the northeast city
of Tangshan.

   A small oil painting by Pierre Auguste Renoir has

Friday.
   Although the painting's official title was not immediately
available, an English translation of its Japanese title reads
``Young Girl's Head.'' It was painted by the French artist in 1908
and was estimated to be worth $158,000.
   Police said the work, which measures 4-by-4{ inches, had been on
display at the Nichido Gallery in Nagoya since Sunday. The theft
was discovered Wednesday.

<HEAD>Khamenei Denies Differences Among Iranian Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, on Friday denied there were rifts within the Iranian
leadership, Tehran radio reported.
   Khamenei said the Western news media's portrayal of differences
among Iranian leaders was a result of ``their blindness and
folly.'' He said the West failed to understand the ``divine and
spiritual relationships'' among the country's leaders.
   Sharp differences over economic policy and normalizing relations
with the West are believed to exist among Iranian leaders.
   Khamenei, who is often aligned with the pragmatic President
Hashemi Rafsanjani, favors a more laissez-faire economy and mending
ties with the West to attract investment and technology for the
country's flagging economy.
   A radical opposition camp, led by former Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, wants tighter government control of the economy
and eschews good ties with the West.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said Khamenei was speaking
to thousands of worshipers gathered at the shrine of the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the outskirts of Tehran.
   The weekly prayer was significant Friday because it coincided
with the Islamic celebration of Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of the
Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.
   Rafsanjani won a major victory over his rival camp by helping
gain the release Sunday of American educator Robert Polhill from
pro-Iranian Lebanese captors.
   Recognizing the hostages as perhaps the greatest obstacle
blocking ties with the West, Rafsanjani is believed to want to end
the crisis by gaining release of the 17 remaining Western captives
in Lebanon.
   The radicals, including Mohtashemi, want the captives to remain.
   Most of the hostages, who include seven Americans, are believed
to be held by pro-Iranian Shiite factions in Lebanon. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Despite their best efforts, the
residents of Kalapana may be fighting a losing battle to preserve
their town from a lava flow from Kilauea Volcano.
   This rural community lost six more houses Thursday and three
early today, said Bruce Butts, a civil defense spokesman.
   The latest toll brings to 31 the number of houses destroyed this
month, or about a quarter of the 125 homes in and around the
Kalapana Gardens subdivision. In all, 107 houses have been
destroyed along the southeastern coast of Hawaii Island since the
volcano began erupting Jan. 3, 1983.
   Two separate flows were joining together to overrun the
subdivision with a sea of fast-moving lava that was heading toward
the town's heart. The activity caused Civil Defense officials to
extend blockades and to warn residents of the possibility of large
methane gas explosions.
   Lava surges were occurring in several areas, threatening several
more homes and continuing the destruction that has gone
uninterrupted in the past week.
   Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim warned
residents that the town's one store and two churches could be
destroyed in the next week to 10 days.
   ``I'm amazed by the constant fluidity. It's losing very little
of its temperature,'' Kim said. He said the lava was moving a foot
a minute in some places.
   The coastal community may soon be history, said Kim, who now
refers to people being ``relocated'' rather than ``evacuated''
because he doesn't think they'll be able to return.
   Moving companies were volunteering their services to help
residents pack, move their homes or dismantle them for
reconstruction later. But the lava swallowed up five homes Thursday.
   Michael Stephens, whose house was the second to burn up
Thursday, had the dubious honor of being the 100th homeowner
victimized by the Hawaiian volcano goddess Madam Pele.
   ``I didn't think it was going to happen at first, then I thought
it was,'' Stephens said. ``I really couldn't think straight.''
   After his home burned, Stephens helped neighbors pack their
belongings.
   The American Red Cross set up a disaster relief center near the
Civil Defense command post at Harry K. Brown Park, on the outskirts
of the town. About three dozen residents had set up tents in the
park.
   Tourists continued to flock to the area, trying to glimpse the
imminent destruction oozing its way forward.
   Kini Pea, a custodian at the Star of the Sea church who had
watched it being built in the 1930s, said Sunday service is planned
as usual.
   Buidling-moving companies have volunteered to move the church
for free, but officials have yet to decide when and where to move
it.
   Meanwhile, the Hawaii's insurance industry has assured state
Insurance Commissioner Robin Campaniano that area homeowners will
continue to be insured.
   One company, Royal Insurance Co., had recently drawn
Campaniano's ire when it refused to renew a policy for a house
threatened by lava. Campaniano said Roayl has agreed to honor its
commitments to policyholders in the area.

   A tractor-trailer sideswiped a rig carrying
16 Harpoon rockets on Interstate 64 in rural northeastern Kentucky,
but no explosion or fire ensued, authorities said.
   The tractor-trailer's driver and his wife, a passenger, were
injured in the accident about 11:30 p.m. Thursday. The driver of
the missile rig and another passenger were not hurt.
   The missiles, each equipped with a warhead containing a
500-pound explosive, were ``unarmed,'' meaning that further
procedures were needed to make them battle-ready, said Navy
spokesman Craig Quigley in Washington.
   He said the missiles were transported in special shipping
containers ``so that accidents of this nature will not yield an
explosion.''
   The interstate highway was closed about 9{ hours following the
accident. It was reopened this morning after the rig was towed to
the Bluegrass Army Depot near Lexington for inspection, said
Kentucky State Police trooper Gary Kistner.
   The accident posed no threat to the surrounding community and no
one was evacuated, officials with the Kentucky State Police and
state Disaster and Emergency Services said. Two explosives experts
from Fort Knox arrived at the scene by helicopter early today.
   The missiles were being shipped from the Yorktown, Va., Naval
Weapons Station to a McDonnell Douglas Corp. weapons plant in St.
Charles, Mo., according to a statement issued by the Navy.
   Harpoon missiles are a type of cruise missile that can be
launched from ships, submarines or aircraft. The 12- to 15-foot
weapon is considered a medium-range anti-ship missile.
   Mark McDaniel, a spokesman for the state disaster agency, said
the rockets ``were standard explosives _ not atomic or anything
like that.''
   Charles Harrell, 49, of Phillipsburg, Mo., was driving the
rocket-loaded rig when it was sideswiped by a tractor-trailer
driven by Jimmy Scott, 55, of Florrissant, Mo., Kistner said.
   Scott, a driver for J.B. Hunt Transport of Lowell, Ark.,
apparently lost control of his truck and crossed the highway's
median, colliding with the tractor part of the rig carrying the
missiles, Kistner said.
   Scott was listed in serious but stable condition at King's
Daughter's Medical Center in Ashland, said nursing supervisor
Sherry Swimm. Scott's wife, Marion, was treated and released.
   Harrell, a driver for Diablo Transportation Inc. of Pacheco,
Calif., and a passenger were uninjured.
   A state environmental response team was sent to the scene after
200 to 300 gallons of diesel fuel spilled because of the wreck,
said McDaniel.
   ``My best information is that it was contained at the scene,''
said McDaniel.

   Gov. Garrey Carruthers and two dozen of
his top staffers passed drug tests they took earlier this week in
an effort to diffuse wrangling over a new state testing policy, the
governor's office said.
   Carruthers on Monday unexpectedly directed the staffers to be
tested for drugs. The governor also was tested.
   Press secretary Eddie Binder said all other staffers in the
governor's office and Cabinet members are being asked to
voluntarily submit to drug tests.
   The tests marked the beginning of a policy that will subject
applicants and employees in safety-sensitive jobs to random urine
tests to check for illegal drugs.
   Before it takes to effect June 1, state workers may admit to any
drug problems and enter treatment programs. They would be offered
30 days' administrative leave with pay during treatment.
   State employee unions have criticized the policy as punitive and
unfair.

   A water bed extinguished a fire and

   An electrical short in a small oscillating fan started a fire
early Thursday in the bedroom of a mobile home owned by Ken Lloyd,
fire officials said. Lloyd and three other occupants were sleeping
in another room when they were awakened by a smoke alarm and fled.
   The fire spread to the water bed, causing it to rupture and
douse the blaze, said Lt. Gary Pipes of the Arlington Fire
Department. He said the fire caused an estimated $5,000 damage.
   ``It's fair to say the fire would have been more substantial,''
Pipes said.

   An explosion killed a builder
driving near the border today, just hours after authorities issued
public warnings that a new Irish Republican Army terror attack was
expected soon.
   The IRA has targeted people involved in construction work for
the security forces in Northern Ireland. It has killed 13 other
people in similar attacks since 1985.
   The killings are an attempt to halt refurbishment and building
programs at police stations, which have either been bombed or need
renovation.
   The builder, identified as Ken Graham of Kilkeel, was believed
to have done construction work at police and military installations
in the province, defying IRA death threats.
   Police said the explosion was at an intersection near Kilkeel,
five miles from the border with Ireland. Police could not
immediately determine whether the bomb was placed in the car or
planted in the road. Graham later died in the hospital.
   He was the 20th person killed in political and sectarian
violence this year in Northern Ireland.
   Police said today they discovered a major bomb factory in a
vacant house in the border town of Newry, also County Down, and
confiscated nine 110-pound bags of explosives and a rifle. No
arrests were made.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary headquarters warned the public on
Thursday night to be ``extremely vigilant'' in ``the period
immediately ahead,'' and asked people to report anything suspicious.
   Road blocks were in place throughout Northern Ireland. At
Belfast International Airport today, there were delays averaging 45
minutes at the main security checkpoint on the road leading to the
Aldergrove terminal.
   In Belfast, meanwhile, an admitted member of the IRA pleaded
guilty to 42 charges, including two murders in 1974. Sean
O'Callaghan, a native of Ireland, said he was not apologizing.
   ``I would have thought myself cowardly and remiss if I did not
set out to end British rule and unify my country,'' O'Callaghan
said. He is to be sentenced later.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly
Catholic Irish Republic.
   In London, meanwhile, the Court of Appeal today overturned the
convictions of three Irish people in 1988 for allegedly conspiring
to murder the top British official in Northern Ireland.
   Three Court of Appeal judges ruled that Tom King, the target of
the alleged attack, could have prejudiced the outcome by appearing
on television and arguing that terrorist suspects should not have
the right to remain silent.
   The Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge should have
dismissed the jury and ordered a new trial.
   Shouting and cheering erupted in the Old Bailey courtroom
following the ruling. The three prisoners, Martina Shanahan, 24,
John McCann, 26, and Finbar Cullen, 29, hugged their lawyers.
   The three were immediately rearrested under the Prevention of
Terrorist Act, and police applied for orders barring them from
returning to Britain. Defense lawyers said they expected the trio
to leave for Ireland by Saturday.

<HEAD>Rostropovich Compares Arts Aid Restrictions to Soviet Censorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mstislav Rostropovich, artistic director of
the National Symphony Orchestra, on Friday compared restrictions on
federal aid to the arts to the Soviet Union's censorship of
writers, artists and composers.
   Testifying before a Senate hearing on financing for the National
Endowment for the Arts, Rostropovich recalled how he had chafed
under Soviet censorship and smuggled out of that country a
symphony, ``Babiy Yar'' by D.D. Shostakovich.
   ``It was that life under censorship that led me to the United
States,'' Rostropovich said.
   Only now, he said, are Soviet people learning about some of
their own writers and seeing their works published.
   ``Art and literature should be judged by the conscience of the
creator, his peers in his field and all of the people, not by a
separate bureaucracy, artificially compressing the arteries and
veins of this life-sustaining circulation,'' he said.
   Rostropovich was among the witnesses supporting reauthorization
of the NEA before the education, arts and humanities subcommittee
of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   The NEA has come under intense criticism for works of art
produced by artists who received support from the endowment and
which were judged by some to be obscene or offensive.
   Congress added language to its 1990 appropriation for NEA
preventing federal aid for ``obscene'' art, ``including but not
limited to depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual
exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   A prominent New York producer, Joseph Papp, on Thursday turned
down a $50,000 NEA grant rather than pledge that none of the
government money would be used for works that might be judged
obscene.
   Phyllis Schlafly, president of the Eagle Forum, a conservative
group, argued at the hearing that federal support for the endowment
should be cut off.
   She said the issue was not censorship but responsible use of
taxpayers' money.
   ``Nobody has a right to receive unrestricted grants of the
taxpayers' money,'' Schlafly said.
   ``The NEA was born in the mid-1960s, when unregulated handouts
to targeted constituencies were the passion of the day,'' Schlafly
said. ``That era is over. ... Having proved its irresponsibility in
spending the taxpayers' money, the National Endowment for the Arts
should be completely defunded.''
   The chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, John E.
Frohnmayer, appeared at a House subcommittee hearing a day earlier
where he called the restrictive language a compromise ``probably
fully satisfactory to none.'' He said ``confusion'' about the
restrictions among artists was demonstrated by Papp's action.
   Frohnmayer said the language ``has made our task more difficult
rather than easier,'' and repeated his request that no content
restrictions be added to the next appropriation, and said the
endowment would pursue its plans to improve a peer panel review
process.

   Original Mouseketeer Darlene wants to see Walt Disney
Productions in court.
   K-E-Y ...
   Why?
   Because she says they cheated her out of royalties from the
original ``Mickey Mouse Club.''
   Darlene Gillespie is accusing Disney of taking advantage of her
in 1955 when the then 14-year-old Mouseketeer-to-be signed a
contract. Her lawsuit contends the entertainment company failed to
tell her the true terms of her employment on the popular television
show.
   Disney spokesman Erwin Okun said the company would have no
comment until attorneys had a chance to review the court papers.
   The Superior Court suit filed Thursday alleges that Disney
falsely promised the young Darlene a ``substantial amount of
money'' from her percentage of the sales of character
merchandising, royalties and residuals from record sales.
   Disney further ``failed to inform her that her actual realized
earnings would be divided in such a way that (she) would not earn
any more than a few dollars from the sales,'' the lawsuit says.
   In court papers, Gillespie said she only became aware of the
gravity of her loss in 1987.
   Disney, the lawsuit contends, has earned more than $10 million
from Ms. Gillespie's appearances on the show. The suit seeks
unspecified punitive, general and compensatory damages.

   Former President Reagan, moved by a newspaper
account of a little girl blinded by cancer, visited her at the
hospital, chatting with her about dogs, horses and unicorns.
   Reagan traveled across town Thursday to Childrens Hospital to
comfort and chat with 4-year-old Kati Sleeman, who suffers from a
form of eye cancer and a brain tumor. The cancer has spread and her
prognosis is poor.
   In a recent Los Angeles Times article, officials at Childrens
Hospital noted the cheerful, energetic and loving spirit of the
little girl.
   ``She's amazing,'' said nurse Cammie Lancaster. ``If people
could only view the world the way Kati views it. ... She just
radiates love.''
   When Reagan arrived, he brought a stuffed pooch. Immediately the
little girl asked him if he had a dog.
   ``Yes,'' the former president answered. Kati pressed him on the
name.
   ``Rex,'' Reagan replied.
   She wanted to know if he had horses. When Reagan assured her he
did, she asked if they were unicorns. The former president laughed.
   After visiting with Kati, Reagan visited other children

   A murderer responsible for four deaths in
a bloody 1979 rampage expressed remorse before he was executed
early Friday, but a cheer erupted from a waiting crowd as his body
was borne from the death house.
   Ronald ``Rusty'' Woomer, 35, was electrocuted at 1:05 a.m. and
pronounced dead seven minutes later, said William D. Catoe, the
Corrections Department's deputy commissioner for operations.
   The West Virginia native was put to death for the murder of
Della Louise Sellers, a Pawleys Island convenience-store clerk.
   ``I'm sorry,'' Woomer said in a low, shaky voice from the
electric chair immediately before his death. ``I claim Jesus Christ
as my savior. I only wish everyone could feel the love I feel for
him.''
   A crowd of about 80 death penalty proponents cheered as the
hearse bearing Woomer's body left the death house. But his
execution gave little immediate solace to Mrs. Sellers' widower.
   ``It was too easy. It was too easy,'' said Don Sellers, who was
among the witnesses at Woomer's execution.
   Woomer's death sentence was carried out after the U.S. Supreme
Court denied requests for a stay. Gov. Carroll Campbell also turned
down a plea for clemency Thursday.
   ``I'm glad to know Woomer won't ever be on the streets again to
harm anybody else,'' said 50-year-old Marion Wright, the brother of
Earldean Wright, another of Woomer's victims.
   Woomer's path to death row began on Feb. 21, 1979, when he and
Eugene Skaar left West Virginia to steal rare coins from retired
engineer John Turner, 67, in Cottageville, S.C. Upon reaching
Turner's home on Feb. 22, they took the coins and fatally shot him
in the head, police said.
   Woomer and Skaar then drove to a neighboring community and
forced their way into the home of Arnie Richardson, looking for
money and guns. Woomer killed Richardson, 27, and his 35-year-old
mentally handicapped sister-in-law, Earldean Wright, authorities
said.
   Later that day, Woomer and Skaar kidnapped Mrs. Sellers, 34, and
Wanda Summers, then 24, from the store where the women worked. Both
were raped and shot. Mrs. Sellers died, but Mrs. Summers survived,
losing half her face to a shotgun blast. Mrs. Summers has taken a
public stand to press for Woomer's execution.
   Skaar killed himself to avoid capture and Woomer surrendered
when police surrounded their Myrtle Beach hotel.
   Woomer was sentenced to death for Mrs. Sellers' murder and two
life terms for the deaths of Richardson and Ms. Wright. His
conviction and death sentence in the Turner slaying was overturned,
but he was never retried.
   Two other people have been put to death in South Carolina since
the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Woomer was the 123rd
person put to death nationwide since 1976.

   The lens cover on the Hubble Space
Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and
Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are
needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
   ``You've been released from Hubble support; it's on its own,''
Mission Control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door
opened.
   ``Thank you, sir, that's great news,'' said Discovery Commander
Loren J. Shriver.
   ``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here,'' said
Steve Hawley, who had been at the controls when the telescope was
released into its own orbit on Wednesday. ``I'll bet it's just that
way down there, too.''
   The successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the
astronauts to return to Earth on Sunday. They had blasted into
space Tuesday after a two-week delay and dispatched the telescope
from its payload bay Wednesday.
   ``The Hubble is open for business,'' Mission Control told the
astronauts.
   The telescope still was having problems, however. When the door
opened, two of its four position-stabilizing gyroscopes stopped
working and the electronic system went into an automatic ``safe
mode'' in which all motion is stopped.
   The team at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which
guides the telescope, said the door-opening motion jarred the
telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted
properly in shutting down.
   By early afternoon, a step-by-step procedure was begun to bring
the telescope's electronics back on line.
   Steve Terry, a top Hubble engineering official, said tolerances
for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the
first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions. In
addition to the trouble this morning, there two communications
outages Thursday totaling several hours.
   ``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' he said. ``We've got a
very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything to
jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we know
exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
   NASA announced that ``at this time the telescope is safe,
stable.''
   The space shuttle Discovery, which carried the telescope to
orbit, was 50 miles behind the telescope, ready to lend a hand if
needed. Later in the day, the ship was to do an engine firing that
would set it on a preliminary path for home.
   That path would take the Discovery two miles below the telescope.
   The lens cover, a 10-foot diameter ``aperature door,'' covers
the opening to the telescope's light shield. When it is closed, the
telescope is blind.
   The lens cover had been closed _ except for a tiny wedge opening
_ ever since the $1.5 billion telescope was dropped overboard by
the Discovery crew on Wednesday.
   Now that it is opened, starlight can strike the lens for the
first time and it can go about its business of photographing and
analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before
possible.
   The door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the
outside with solar-reflecting material. The inside is painted black
to absorb stray light.
   If the door opening command had failed, the five Discovery
astronauts who deployed Hubble were prepared to head back to the
telescope. Mission specialists Bruce McCandless and Kathryn
Sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door
Saturday if necessary.
   If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the
landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by
a day.
   The astronauts were awakened at 2:30 a.m. EDT to the mellow
sounds of the Beach Boys' song, ``Kokomo.''
   ``For Max Q's keyboard, that's the way that song should really
be done,'' Mission Control radioed to mission specialist Steve
Hawley, a member of the all-astronaut band called Max Q. ``Your
next practice is Sunday evening in the gym, don't be late.''
   Max Q is a NASA acronym for the point in the shuttle's ascent
when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point.
   ``That sounds just like the way we do it,'' replied Hawley. ``If
you get us home by Sunday, I'll go to practice.''
   In an orbit high enough to avoid Earth's distorting atmosphere,
Hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so
distant their light has taken 14 billion years to reach Earth. It
is capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times
greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
   During its 15-year working lifetime, Hubble is expected to help
determine the age and size of the universe. It may solve the
mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars
with planets that could conceivably support life.
   On Tuesday, NASA plans to release its first test image from the
telescope, an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
Significant data will follow in a month or two.
   The 12{-ton, 43-foot-long telescope, about the size of a bus, is
named for astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, who died in 1953. The
Missouri-born Hubble discovered during the 1920s that the universe
is expanding, a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe
was created about 15 billion years ago by a tremendous explosion.

<HEAD>Economy's Growth Accompanied by `Ugly' Inflation in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's economy grew at a surprising 2.1
percent rate in the first quarter, the government reported Friday,
but analysts said an ``ugly'' inflation rate could mean higher
interest rates that would slow growth later this year.
   ``We have set ourselves up for a halfway decent first half of
1990,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York. ``But, by the end of the year, the
economy will be slowing.''
   In addition to the strength in the gross national product _ the
nation's total output of goods and services _ the Commerce
Department reported that inflation jumped 6.5 percent, its steepest
jump since a 7.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1981.
The GNP inflation rate for 1989 was 4.5 percent.
   ``The inflation number was absolutely ugly,'' remarked Robert G.
Dederick, chief economist of the Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
   He and other analysts said the pace of inflation _ boosted in
part by the weather _ probably will slow during the current quarter
to the 4.5 percent-5 percent range.
   But that still means the Federal Reserve will not lower interest
rates and may decide to boost them further to slow the price
spiral, they contend.
   Higher rates curb growth in the construction and other
interest-sensitive industries by raising the cost of borrowing.
   J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief economist,
called the inflation report ``disappointing news.'' Without the
weather effect and a federal pay raise that went into effect in
January, prices still rose 5.2 percent during the quarter, he said.
   But Villamil was upbeat about the 2.1 percent GNP grow, which
nearly doubled the 1.1 percent rate during the fourth quarter and
came close to matching the administration's 2.2 percent forecast.
   The administration is counting on a growing economy to help
narrow the federal budget deficit.
   ``Despite the larger price rise,'' Villamil said, ``the first
quarter still had encouraging developments _ signs of the economy's
resilience.''
   Most economists agreed.
   ``On the GNP data, one can't find anything wrong with this
economy,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston Co.
``Everything is up except inventories,'' a development he said was
a ``healthy sign.''
   Lower inventories usually result in a rise in production as
companies restock their shelves and backlots.
   Other than inventories, however, increases in the GNP were
widespread. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of
economic activity, rose 2.5 percent after a meager 0.5 percent
advance in the previous quarter.
   Durable goods, which had fallen 14 percent from October through
December, more than recovered with a 17 percent jump. Automobiles
accounted for about two-thirds of the increase.
   The trade deficit narrowed as exports rose 0.9 percent while
imports dropped 2.8 percent. The deficit is the difference between
the two.
   Business investment for expansion and modernization rose 7.6
percent after declining 5.4 percent the previous quarter. Housing
construction, which was down 1.1 percent at year's end, jumped 8.5
percent.
   But analysts said much of the housing improvement was due to the
warm weather, which prompted builders to begin projects they
normally would not have started until later in the year. The
analysts said the early starts will subtract from future growth.
   The Commerce Department also said the weather played a part in
hiking the inflation rate.
   The 2.1 percent advance was the fastest since a 3.0 percent gain
in the third quarter last year. The various changes left the GNP,
after adjusting for inflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.196
trillion in the first three months of the year.

<HEAD>Mongolian Protest Ends Peacefully After Security Forces Move In</HEAD>

   Thousands of people gathered outside the
Mongolian government palace for an illegal protest Friday but
dispersed peacefully after security forces surrounded the palace,
sources in Mongolia said.
   It was the first direct confrontation between protesters and
security forces in five months of pro-democracy demonstrations in
Mongolia, and both sides seemed anxious to avoid violence. The
security forces did not have weapons or riot gear, said the sources
in the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator.
   The protesters, who demanded resignation of the
Communist-dominated legislature, violated a recent edict by
President Punsalmaagiin Ochirbat that all demonstrations be
approved in advance.
   Ochirbat tried to head off the confrontation by offering
Thursday night to set up a council for opposition groups to make
suggestions to the legislature. But the opposition demanded that a
multiparty interim legislature govern until elections are held.
Voting is tentatively set for July.
   Suhjargalmaa, an editor at the official Montsame News Agency,
said in a telephone interview from Ulan Bator that the largest
opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic Association, had planned
to circle the government palace when the demands were not met by
noon.
   But police and soldiers of the internal militia formed a
protective circle first and blocked adjoining streets, Suhjargalmaa
said. The protesters were able to form a picket line on only one
side of the palace, fronting a large central square where
supporters and onlookers gathered. Other opposition groups,
including the National Progressives and Social Democrats, also
joined.
   ``There were about 40,000 at noon but now there are much
fewer,'' Suhjargalmaa said in the early evening. Other sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the protest leaders had
left by mid-afternoon and only curious passers-by remained later.
They said the crowd peaked at about 10,000 but that only 1,200 to
1,400 seemed actively involved.
   Students chanted ``Youth unite!'' and waved national flags and
emblems of the Mongolian Democratic Association, said the Soviet
news agency Tass. Mongolian radio said the government broadcast
appeals over loudspeakers for the crowd to disperse but that
protesters responded with shouts for the soldiers to leave.
   The breakup of the protest appeared to have been gradual, and it
was unclear if any concessions were made to end the protest.
   So far, Mongolia's democracy movement, inspired by change
elsewhere in the Soviet bloc, has been peaceful. The Communists,
formally called the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, gave up
their constitutional right to rule in March and agreed to the
country's first multiparty elections, apparently believing they
could best stay in power by embracing reforms.
   But the opposition has accused the party of cheating by amending
the election law to give more delegates to rural areas, where the
Communists are strongest. Opposition groups want this changed and
demand the immediate transfer of power to a multiparty, interim
legislature.
   The Mongolian Democratic Association set a deadline of noon
Friday for the government to respond.
   Ochirbat offered instead to set up an advisory council for the
opposition to work with the existing legislature, and to let it
join in the work of the Central Election Council. Suhjargalmaa said
talks between the two sides ended when the opposition members
walked out.
   The opposition is also demanding that the ruling party's Central
Committee move its offices from the government palace, and that all
parties be allowed to join a commission that is investigating
former high-ranking officials.
   The commission was set up by the ruling party in early April to
uncover alleged abuses of power under former dictator Yumjaagiyn
Tsedenbal. He was ousted in 1984, but many of his associates remain
in government and the party.

   Church bells tolled, black flags fluttered in
the breeze and the doors of Jesus' burial site were shut Friday for
possibly the first time in 800 years as Christians protested a
Jewish settlement in Jerusalem's Old City.
   In an unusual show of unity, about 150 clergymen from nine major
Christian sects gathered to oversee the closing of the Church of
the Holy Sepulcher, which marks the site of Jesus' crucifixion and
burial.
   Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah, Greek Orthodox Patriarch Diodoros
I, and Armenian Orthodox Patriarch Torkum Manoogian recited the
Lord's Prayer in Arabic, Armenian and Greek before the massive
wooden doors swung shut.
   Wajih Nusseibeh, a Moslem whose family keeps the key of the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher, said it was the first time the doors
were closed since the Crusaders were driven out of the city by the
Islamic warrior Saladin in the 12th century A.D.
   The Church of the Nativity, which marks the site of Jesus' birth
in Bethlehem, and holy sites throughout the country were also
closed in the daylong protest. Church bells rang in somber,
funereal cadence for about fivehree days in another Army
hospital.
   ``I regret that, at the moment, I am unable to thank you more
directly and personally,'' Polhill said in the prepared statement.
``But my voice decided to go on vacation before I did. However, I
do want you to know how very much I appreciate the warmth and
sincerity of your welcome and the support you've given my wife and
family, who join me in hoping that this is the beginning of the end
to the hostage situation.
   ``I am, happily, now free to join you in your continued support
for the loved ones of those who remain in captivity and in
welcoming the hostages home in the very near future. Let's show the
world that we, the American people, want to leave the past behind
us, look positively to the future and, once and for all, close the
file on the hostage issue.''
   Asked whether her husband was angry at his captors, Mrs. Polhill
said, ``His being angry has been blown out of all proportion.'' She
did not elaborate.
   As to her own feelings, she said, ``I feel good to have him
back.'' She said that she and her husband spent their first night
together in the states resting, talking and doing ``everything
every normal couple would do.''
   She also said that although Polhill and the other hostages
received little news in their captivity she believes he knew that
George Bush was president before the chief executive telephoned him
in Damascus.
   The Army doctor said he expects the biopsy to be performed ``in
the near future,'' although he could not be more specific.
   He said Polhill ``appears to be in good spirits considering the
ordeal he has been through.''
   ``There is no evidence that he was beaten,'' the doctor said. He
said Polhill had indicated to other physicians that he was not.
   In addition to the growth on his vocal cords, the doctor said
Polhill has some numbness or tingling in his arms and hands as a
complication of his diabetes. He said Polhill had told other
physicians that he was given insulin for his condition while in
custody.
   With a wave and a broad smile, Polhill stepped off a military
jet Thursday onto the sun-drenched tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base
in suburban Maryland.
   He was whisked away by car to Walter Reed Army Medical Center,
but not before shaking hands with the small official welcoming
party and offering several thumbs-up salutes to reporters and a
small group of Air Force personnel on hand for his arrival.
   Polhill maintained his public silence on his arrival. In private
talks with U.S. officials, he reportedly has given a vivid and
detailed account of his ordeal.
   The return of the 55-year-old business professor left behind in
the Middle East 17 Western Hostages, seven of them Americans.
   Although Polhill's release brought hopes that additional
American hostages soon would share his freedom, the U.S. debriefing
team that traveled to Wiesbaden, West Germany, to meet with Polhill
departed Thursday, seemingly a sign that no release is considered
imminent.
   For Polhill, it was back to a military hospital. He left one at
the Air Force base in Wiesbaden, where he spent three days after
his weekend release, and went to Walter Reed for a complete
physical and other tests and treatment. Polhill lost 25 pounds in
captivity and also is a diabetic.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
planned to meet soon with Polhill but that a date had not been set.
Other administration officials also likely will have questions for
Polhill about his captors.
   Polhill was abducted with two other American educators on Jan.
24, 1987, from the campus of the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University
College. The other two remain among the seven American hostages.
The longest-held of the U.S. hostages is Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.

   The ruling Communist Party will soon be relegated
to a minority role in the Soviet Union unless it figures out how to
win over voters, Moscow's party chief warned Friday.
   ``If we can't learn to understand and defend the interests of
the people, we'll have to go into the opposition,'' Yuri A.
Prokofiev, leader of Moscow's 1.1 million Communists, told a news
conference.
   ``If there are no improvements in people's lives in the near
future, then in the next elections they may not vote at all for the
Communist Party, and it could end up in the minority,'' he added.
   Prokofiev was speaking from experience. In Moscow elections in
March, many Communists were trounced by more reformist candidates
who blamed the party for the city's many ills.
   Prokofiev himself was elected to the Moscow City Council, but
the bloc in the council that supports the Communist Party platform
numbers only about 90, compared with some 400 in the more radical
Democratic Russia group.
   In the Soviet Union's first multi-candidate elections, held over
the past year, many Communist leaders have been defeated. Officials
say they are victims of the party's ``crisis of confidence.''
   Prokofiev acknowledged that 6,000 Muscovites quit the party in
the first quarter of this year but said only ``a scattered few''
were leaving for ideological reasons. He said most were elderly or
token members who were no longer active Communists anyway.
   Of those who quit on principle, he said, about half left because
they think reforms are proceeding too slowly and the other half
because they oppose reform altogether, he said.
   Prokofiev predicted the Communist Party would formally split
soon, losing a reformist group known as the Democratic Platform.
But he said he had high hopes for this July's Party Congress, which
could help both improve the party's image and heal the rift between
party officials and rank-and-file Communists.
   Meanwhile, he said, the party is working on ``legally
strengthening'' its claim on buildings, newspapers and other
properties to make sure it won't lose them if it falls from power.
   Prokofiev said he had learned from the extensive financial
losses among Polish Communists whose party did not take such
measures before elections last year that ended in a Solidarity-led
government.
   He said Moscow party officials were also seeking commercial
ventures they could undertake to earn money to buy television time,
pay rent, and foot other bills that never came up when the party
and the government were virtually the same.
   In other Communist Party news, Leningrad party chief Boris
Gidaspov was re-elected Friday, the Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   Gidaspov is considered a leader of the more conservative wing of
the Communist Party. He has warned that allowing private property
would result in black marketeers dominating the economy. He drew
criticism last fall for organizing a party protest at which some
speakers denounced the Politburo and Kremlin reforms.
   Gidaspov, a former factory director, defeated four other
candidates in a secret vote, Tass said.

   Fifteen homeless people, some with only
pennies in their pockets, came into a windfall when the city paid
out $50,000 to settle a lawsuit protesting the mass street cleanup
of stashed bedrolls.
   ``I've come up a long way in the world in just a matter of
minutes,'' said Chuck Daigle, who began Thursday practically
penniless and later received his share _ a check for $3,308.46.
   The unemployed restaurant worker planned a steak and lobster
dinner, while co-plaintiff George Ellithorpe eyed a haircut and a
shave. Most recipients wanted to use the money to help them get off
the streets, said attorney Christopher Mears, who represented the
group.
   ``I hope it's not naive to be hopeful that, for a number of
these people, the money is going to help turn things around,'' said
Mears, who accepted only $373.10 to cover his expenses and court
costs.
   Plans ranged from finding a room for the night to car buying and
traveling to Alaska in search of long-lost relatives, Mears said.
   Daigle, who said he and Ellithorpe had less than 2 cents between
them before receiving the checks, planned a train trip to
Marysville in Northern California to visit relatives and look for
work.
   ``I have a one-shot chance to change my life, and I'm going to
do it. No more dreaming,'' said Daigle, 40.
   The plaintiffs, who live in the streets near the Civic Center,
filed suit in 1988 after their bedrolls and personal belongings
were taken during a street sweep.
   The confiscated belongings were not returned and some said they
lost valuable identification papers, medical prescriptions and
irreplaceable mementos.
   At Mears' request, Sunwest Bank in downtown Santa Ana agreed to
open savings accounts or to cash the checks, even though most in
the group have limited identification and no permanent address.
   Most bought travelers checks.
   Ellithorpe, 61, said his windfall wasn't likely to last long. He
planned to rent an apartment, buy eyeglasses to replace a pair he's
worn for 20 years, and get a haircut and a shave.
   ``I need a rest or a vacation from the streets for at least a
month,'' he said. ``Then I'll hit the bricks again.''

<TEXT>
   A Kansas man charged in a three-state
killing spree that left five dead pleaded guilty but mentally ill
to charges of capital murder and armed robbery in one of those
deaths, a prosecutor said today.
   Gregg Francis Braun of Garden City, Kan., entered his plea on
Thursday in a closed hearing before state District Judge Jay
Harris, said Colfax County Assistant District Attorney Leslie
Skinner.
   Two psychologists testified during the hearing that they
believed Braun suffered from a mental illness last July 23 when
Geraldine Valdez was shot to death in a Springer convenience store
where she worked as a clerk, Ms. Skinner said. Braun was to have
gone on trial May 7 in Taos.
   Braun, 29, also is charged with the July 19, 1989, shooting
deaths of two convenience store clerks in Garden City, Kan.; the
July 20 slaying of a photo processing shop owner in Pampa, Texas;
and the July 21 slaying of a woman in an Ardmore, Okla., flower
shop.
   In an emotional hearing last August, Braun confessed to the
killing of Ms. Valdez and blamed his problems on drugs. He said he
had been using cocaine heavily in the month before the slayings.
   Braun was being held in the Colfax County Jail in Raton. Ms.
Skinner said today that efforts were under way to transfer him to
the state penitentiary near Santa Fe.
   At the hearing Thursday in Las Vegas, N.M., Harris ordered
attorneys for both sides to submit legal briefs on the question of
whether a defendant who pleads guilty but mentally ill can face the
death penalty in New Mexico.
   If courts rule that capital punishment is permissible in such
cases, Ms. Springer said, a jury will later decide whether Braun
deserves the death penalty. If capital punishment is ruled out by
either the jury or the courts, Braun would face life in prison for
the guilty plea, Ms. Skinner said.
   Under New Mexico law, guilty but mentally ill means the
defendant was mentally ill but not legally insane.
   ``There was no reduction in charges, no plea bargaining in this
case by the state,'' she said. ``The defendant simply admitted to
both of the charges and the court found a factual basis for mental
illness.''
   Braun's attorney, Gary Mitchell, was in court on another case
today and could not be reached immediately.

<TEXT>
   France and West Germany are expected to
press European Community leaders at a summit Saturday for swift
progress toward European political union by 1993, despite Britain's
skepticism.
   The British are demanding to know what political union means.
The French and Germans say it's the spirit, rather than
definitions, that matters most at this stage.
   For British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Franco-German
alliance presents a diplomatic challenge: to tone down what she
sees as rhetoric without worsening her reputation as a reluctant
European.
   France and West Germany say they want Saturday's summit to agree
to set up an inter-governmental conference on political union. That
would be in addition to a conference already due late this year on
economic and monetary union.
   ``We are deeply skeptical about the timing,'' British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd said this week. ``Nevertheless, if our
partners wish to set in hand such work, we shall join actively in
the task and contribute our own ideas.''
   Ireland, the holder of the community's rotating presidency,
called the one-day summit to discuss German unification. It will
mean East Germany becoming the first former Communist territory to
join the wealthy 12-nation trade bloc.
   But spurred by fears of resurgent nationalism destabilizing
Europe, France and West Germany have plunged the community into the
momentous issue of political union.
   In an April 15 announcement, they said the community nations
should each have laws in place by Jan. 1, 1993, for both economic
integration and ``political union.'' Five days later, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand
wrote to Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey suggesting the
inter-governmental conference.
   No one has defined what political union means. Possibilities
range from a centralized government, through a United States of
Europe, to the more likely reality of increased powers for the
community's elected parliament and its executive commission in
Brussels.
   ``We are witnessing a decisive thrust toward European unity,''
Kohl declared Thursday after two days of talks with Mitterrand in
Paris.
   ``A dream is coming true _ seeing German unity and European
unity come into being together,'' he said.
   Mitterrand agreed. ``A European Community more unified _ that's
what we want. A structured, balanced, peaceful Europe _ that's what
we are working for.''
   Mrs. Thatcher opposes any form of federal Europe or markedly
greater powers for the European Commission, arguing that no
European government is truly willing to cede national sovereignty
to Brussels.
   A stickler for detail, she plans to ask bluntly what her
continental partners mean by ``political union,'' hoping their
confusion will prove her point _ that no one knows just what it
entails.
   But as Sir Leon Brittan, a senior EEC official, said Thursday:
``It doesn't have a meaning. It means what you want it to mean.''
   Mrs. Thatcher also believes the issue of political union is
premature. She wants the community of 320 million people to give
priority to more immediate issues, like establishing a single,
tariff-free market for Europe by the end of 1992 and incorporating
East Germany's backward economy.
   ``We think the best European cooperation, the best Europe we can
build, will be a Europe of 12 sovereign states sitting willingly
and freely together,'' Mrs. Thatcher said recently.
   ``I believe most people want to be proud of their country and
want to feel that affinity to it as well as to Europe.''
   ``Europe can only live in peace if nationalism is overcome,''
said Irmgard Adam-Schwaetzer, No. 2 to West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
   The Irish say they and other member states _ Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Denmark, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg
_ share a general wish for greater political unity.
   On monetary union, the 12 nations agree on the first stage of a
three-stage program, but Britain is resisting the ultimate goal of
a single central bank and one currency.
   The summit will also discuss closer relations with the other
newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.

   A Lithuanian who died after setting himself on
fire outside the Bolshoi Theater left behind suicide notes calling
on the Soviet president to permit his republic to become
independent, an official said today.
   In notes the victim left for his wife and Lithuanian government
officials, he said he was killing himself to let President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev ``know that Lithuanians will not live in a Lithuania
that is not independent.''
   The contents of the notes were disclosed by Rita Radzavicius, a
spokesman for the Lithuanian parliament, or Supreme Council.
   Stanislovas Jamaitis, 52, died on Thursday of burns suffered
when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set himself ablaze in
central Moscow.
   Jamaitis, who lived in the western Lithuanian city of Kaunas,
left one suicide note for his wife, Stasala, and another for
Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis and the Lithuanian
parliament.
   Referring to the Kremlin's economic blockade on Lithuania, which
declared its indepenence March 11, Jamaitis' said:
   ``I went to Moscow to set myself on fire in Red Square. The
occupiers have cut off energy supplies, and people are being thrown
out of work.''
   Thousands of workers have been laid off recently because of the
economic embargo, which is meant to break the republic's resolve.
   Moscow police spokesman Vladimir Martynov said earlier that
Jamaitis was ``in a drunken state'' when ``he poured gasoline on
himself and lit it.''
   Post-Factum, an independent Soviet news agency, reported that
bystanders said Jamaitis ``had been shouting various things,
including demands for Lithuanian independence,'' in the minutes
before he set himself ablaze.
   Little was known about Jamaitis except that he was the father of
two, had been recently unemployed and came from the Alitus region
about 30 miles southwest of the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius,
Martynov said.
   Passers-by helped extinguish the flames that engulfed Jamaitis,
but he was in shock when brought to the hospital and died five
hours later at 10:05 p.m. Thursday, Martynov reported. He never
regained consciousness.

   President Bush, ignoring congressional
pressure, announced today that he has decided not to place Japan on
a ``hit list'' of countries with the worst trade barriers against
U.S. products.
   India is the only country his administration has decided to keep
on its list of nations targeted for unfair trading practices, Bush
said in a statement.
   Bush hailed what he said was recent progress in easing
U.S.-Japanese trade frictions.
   ``Promoting a vibrant, open trading relationship with Japan
remains a key trade priority of the administration,'' Bush said.
   A recent agreement with Japan that included Japanese concessions
on opening its markets to more U.S. goods was a ``promising
start,'' he said.
   At the same time, he said, he was under no illusion that the
agreement alone would ``lead to an immediate improvement'' in this
nation's $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   But, he said, he was persuaded that Japanese Prime Minister
Toshiki Kaifu and other Japanese leaders ``share my commitment to
ensuring that trade strengthens, rather than undermines, the
friendship between our nations.''
   A year ago, the administration named Japan, Brazil and India as
the countries with the most offensive barriers to American trade.
   Both Japan and Brazil have won praise from the administration
for making significant concessions during negotiations aimed at
opening their markets to American products.
   But India, which was cited last year for a ban on operations of
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign
investment that distort trade, has refused to make concessions.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said that India was
targeted again because it has the most trade barriers of any
non-communist country and negotiations over the past year had made
no progress.
   Several members of Congress had warned the administration that
it would be making a serious mistake to fail to target Japan once
more as a way of keeping pressure on the country to honor its
market-opening commitments.
   But Hills rejected these arguments, saying that the
administration needed flexibility in its negotiating efforts with
other countries.
   ``We believe we have made enormous progress with Japan in the
past few months,'' she told reporters.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
he was glad that the administration had at least issued a new Super
301 list although he was disappointed that Japan was not included.
   ``There has been little improvement in our trade deficit with
that country and I am a bit of a skeptic as to whether the recent
agreements will make much of a difference,'' Bentsen said in a
statement.
   The 1988 trade law required the administration to issue a target
list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989
and 1990.
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' Bush said. ``This administration is
committed to free and fair trade. We want open markets and fair
treatment for our products, services, investment and ideas.''
   Bush said he had also directed Mrs. Hills to ``give her highest
priority'' to seeking a conclusion by December of ongoing
international trade liberalization talks now under way in Geneva.
   Sources said India's refusal to seek a negotiated settlement of
last year's trade case prompted the administration to cite India
again.
   While the designation of India was likely to meet with approval
on Capitol Hill, the refusal to cite Japan was certain to raise
heavy protests.
   Many members of Congress said that would indicate the
administration is not interested in carrying out the requirements
of the toughest section of the 1988 trade law, known as Super 301.
The law provides a tight timetable for negotiating away barriers
and provides for economic sanctions if the talks prove unsuccessful.
   They said Super 301 was written with Japan specifically in mind
and that Japan needed to be targeted again to ensure that it lived
up to its newfound willingness to lower trade barriers.
   In the days before the decision was announced, Hills lavished
praise on both Japan and Brazil for their willingness to negotiate
in good faith and said that citing Japan again could provoke a
backlash in Tokyo, where the Kaifu government has been pushing to
change Japan's trading practices.
   In Japan's case, there has been a flurry of trade agreements
over the past month. Japanese negotiators agreed to open their
markets for the sale of U.S.-made satellites, supercomputers and
forest products _ the three product areas cited in last year's
Super 301 case.
   In addition, Japan and the United States earlier this month
completed an interim agreement designed to attack broad-based
structural barriers that are preventing American and other foreign
companies from doing business in Japan.
   Hills praised Brazil for undertaking a ``fantastic change in
policy'' under newly elected President Fernando Collor de Mellor.
   Brazil has agreed to cut protectionist barriers and submit for
international settlement the licensing restrictions on imports
cited by the United States in last year's complaint.

<HEAD>Senate Keeps $420 Million in Aid to Panama</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 6th graf, A provision... to update with second vote on
abortion</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's aid requests for Nicaragua
and Panama are surviving unscathed in a $3.4 billion spending bill,
and the measure plodded forward today as senators dealt with a long
list of proposed amendments.
   The ``dire emergency'' money bill contained $420 million to help
rebuild Panama's economy and $300 million to help the new
democratic administration of Violeta Chamorro, sworn in Wednesday
as president of Nicaragua.
   ``Mrs. Chamorro's term may expire before we get the aid down
there,'' Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., cracked as he surveyed a
list late Thursday of dozens of amendments that senators sought to
add to the bill.
   Along with the aid Bush is seeking to shore up the fledgling
Central American democracies, the bill has become larded with a
long list of pet spending projects of lawmakers, pushing it to
nearly four times the original White House request.
   Senators today adopted an amendment by Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., calling for a study of how foreign aid can be used to
promote the fortunes of American businesses overseas. It then
turned its attention to a list of proposed amendments that included
sanctions on Iraq and relief for Lithuania.
   A provision in the bill permitting the District of Columbia to
use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women survived two
early test votes, 51-45 and 54-42. But it appeared the Senate was
in for a protracted debate over the perennially divisive issue.
Bush has vowed to veto the bill if the abortion language remains in
it.
   The bill grew by an additional $363 million late Thursday when
senators voted 62-30 to make up a shortfall in the State
Department's current budget. The largest chunk of the money goes to
pay U.S. dues to the United Nations, with other amounts for
construction of buildings overseas and for salaries and expenses.
   Earlier in the day Byrd, chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, tried unsuccessfully to slash the Panama aid to $300
million and use the savings for a variety of domestic programs.
   Byrd sought to harness the general unpopularity of foreign aid
in Congress and cast his amendment as an effort to make charity
begin at home.
   But Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., said the United States has an
obligation to Panama stemming from the U.S. economic embargo and
the damage inflicted by last December's military invasion, which
ousted dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We owe them,'' Hatfield said. ``This is a bill that's due.''
   Senators then voted 51-48 to kill Byrd's attempt, with eight
Democrats joining a nearly solid bloc of Republicans to provide the
majority in support of Bush's request.
   The Senate labored until late evening as it tried to deal with
dozens of proposed amendments, but prospects appeared remote for
quick approval of the overall aid bill.
   When finally passed, the measure still must go to a conference
with the House to work out differences with that chamber's $2.4
billion version. Most of the new spending in both versions of the
bill is covered by cuts in the Pentagon budget.
   And as it stood, the Senate bill faced a veto threat from Bush,
who opposes a provision that would allow the District of Columbia
government to use local funds to pay for abortions for poor women.
   Dealing with related legislation on Thursday, the House Foreign
Affairs Committee defied Bush and voted to cut in half and sharply
restrict the $85 million in annual U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   The action came as an amendment to a bill authorizing spending
of the Panama and Nicaragua aid funds, despite administration
objections that it could undermine fledgling peace talks between
the government of El Salvador and the leftist rebels who have
fought a decade-long civil war.
   It remained unclear whether the restrictions on aid would ever
be finally enacted into law. House Democratic leaders plan to meet
next week with Secretary of State James A. Baker III in an effort
to begin drafting a new bipartisan U.S. policy toward El Salvador
that could head off the restrictions.

   The five New York futures markets halted trading
and closed early today after a communications glitch prevented
price data from being distributed to customers.
   The 11:20 a.m. trading halt brought action in the nation's major
oil and metals trading pits to a standstill after the exchanges
discovered that no price quotes were leaving the building.
   ``The high-speed futures line is dead,'' said Tom Crisalli, an
operations employee with the Commodity Exchange Corp., which
oversees the five futures markets.
   After failing to resolve the problem, the exchanges shut down at
2 p.m. They gave traders five to 10 minutes to finish up pending
trades before going home early. The regular closing times for the
commodities traded at the exchanges run from 2:20 p.m. until after
3 p.m.
   Thousands of traders, brokers and investors around the country
were not receiving quotes on futures prices on their computer
screens. Officials said they were unsure about the origins of the
problem.
   Trading was halted at the Commodity Exchange, the nation's main
metals market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil
trading market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton
Exchange; and the New York Futures Exchange.
   Exchange executives took to the trading floor in the World Trade
Center complex in Manhattan shortly after 11 a.m. to inform
participants that the market would be halted. The normally frenzied
pace of shouted trading in the so-called pits died down and many
players left for the day, traders said.
   ``All of our members started to call up. People who were not on
the floor started calling asking for information,'' said Janet
Troy, spokewoman for the Coffeee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.
   ``I've been in this business over 10 years. I've never seen it
go down this long,'' said John Jonat, a precious- metals trader
Deak International Inc.
   Exchange officials said they believed the problem involved
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. lines that feed the data out of
the exchanges.
   But AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda Haertlein said the difficulty did not
appear to be in the AT&amp;T network but at the exchange.
   After they are recorded on slips of paper and entered into
computers on the exchange floor, the futures price information is
relayed to an on-site AT&amp;T facility that relays it to outside
points identified by the exchange.
   ``The AT&amp;T facility tests OK at this point and time,'' Haertlein
said. ``The problem does not appear to be in the AT&amp;T network.''
   The New York markets trade futures contracts from orange juice
to gold in an open-outcry system where bids are shouted by
designated floor brokers. The New York markets are second to
Chicago's commodity markets in trading volume and importance.

   Pro-Moscow truckers protesting Lithuania's
campaign for independence blocked rush-hour traffic in the Baltic
republic's capital this morning, while local authorities debated
how to ease tension with the Kremlin.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis weighed a proposal
from the leaders of France and Germany designed to end the impasse
that began with Lithuania's declaration of independence on March 11.
   The demonstration included about 50 trucks and was organized by
Communist Party members and Russian workers, said Rita Radzevicius,
a spokeswoman at the Lithuanian Supreme Council, or parliament, in
the capital city, Vilnius.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the truckers opposed the
``adventurist decisions of the Lithuanian'' parliament. It said
supporters of the Lithuanian popular front Sajudis dragged the
trucks from the streets with tractors.
   Ms. Radzevicius said in a telephone interview that local
authorities persuaded the truckers to end the blockade after about
two hours, but she said force was not used.
   Because of gas shortages caused by the Kremlin blockade,
rush-hour traffic in Vilnius was much lighter than usual. Many
people walked to work or used the city's extensive trolley system.
   The truckers worked for the Autotransport Enterprise in Vilnius
and consisted mostly of Russians who are members of Yedinstvo and
the splinter of the Lithuanian Communist Party that follows the
Kremlin line. Some Lithuanians also took part, she said.
   The main Lithuanian Communist Party split with Moscow in
December. Yedinstvo consists of Russians, Poles and other
minorities who believe that the Lithuanian majority is infringing
on their rights.
   Lithuanian authorities, meanwhile, grappled with a partial
economic blockade imposed by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
after the independence declaration, and groped for a diplomatic
solution to the standoff.
   Many shop shelves were empty, and the embargo slowed work at 46
businesses and stopped it at two others in Lithuania, the Moscow
newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna reported. The Kremlin has cut off all
oil and and 80 percent of Lithuania's natural gas supply, causing
thousands of workers to be laid off.
   Lithuania will begin food rationing on Tuesday, Vilnius Radio
reported, as the republic of 3.8 million struggles under the
economic embargo.
   A leading politician in the neighboring Baltic republic of
Estonia today pledged to help Lithuania survive the Soviet
blockade, even at the risk of relatiation by Moscow.
   ``We have to help Lithuania in every case,'' said Marju
Lauristin, a leader of the Estonian People's Front, in what she
said was the majority opinion of the Estonian Supreme Soviet. She
spoke during a visit to Helsinki, Finland.
   And in Brussels today, Lithuanian parliamentarians asked Belgium
to help offset Moscow's economic blockade. The delegation arrived
with ``the precise mission of launching an SOS for our people,''
said Emanuelis Zingeris, chairman of the Lithuanian parliament's
foreign affairs panel.
   Gorbachev, touring an industrial center in the Urals, was
confronted Thursday by activists protesting his crackdown in
Lithuania, with demonstrators branding him a ``political
hypocrite.''
   On the diplomatic front, French President Francois Mitterrand
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl delivered a proposal to
Lithuanian representatives in Moscow suggesting that the Baltic
republic temporarily suspend its secessionist actions ``so that the
current crisis ends in a solution acceptable to all parties.''
   Landsbergis, in an apparent bid to find something positive in
the letter from Mitterrand and Kohl, described it as ``a step
forward toward the realization of Lithuanian independence.''
   Lithuania wants an immediate dialogue, Landsbergis said, and ``a
termination of the Soviet economic blockade against Lithuania would
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue.''
   ``The leadership of Lithuania, greatly appreciating this act of
good will on the part of two noted leaders, will carefully study
this letter's proposition,'' he added.
   The letter came two days after President Bush refused to impose
sanctions on Moscow at this time for bringing economic and military
pressure on Lithuania _ a move that clearly angered Landsbergis.
   When asked if Landsbergis was disappointed by the letter from
Mitterrand and Kohl, Lithuanian parliamentary spokesman Ed Tuskenis
said the president viewed ``as positive'' the fact that it did not
mention revoking the republic's March 11 declaration of
independence. The letter discussed the temporary suspension of some
decisions by the Lithuanian parliament, the Supreme Council.
   Kremlin authorities on Monday urged Lithuania to suspend for two
years its declaration of independence.
   Lithuanian leaders have refused to revoke the declaration. But
the Baltic republic's leadership has always been willing ``to
discuss the timing and the form of independence, whether or not
that's a year or two,'' Tuskenis said after talking to Landsbergis.
   ``They said they never expected independence to come within a
matter of days, and they don't expect full independence in a
practical sense right away,'' he said by telephone from Vilnius.
   Also today, Lithuanian authorities disclosed that a Lithuanian
man who died Thursday after setting himself on fire outside the
Bolshoi Theater in Moscow left suicide notes calling on Gorbachev
to let Lithuania become independent.
   Since independence was declared in Lithuania, which was forcibly
annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, Gorbachev has imposed the
economic embargo and used the military to occupy some buildings in
Vilnius and round up army deserters.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, acknowledging
his warplane cutbacks could be just the beginning of major Pentagon
changes, predicted Friday that America's military is destined to be
``significantly smaller than it is today.''
   Cheney met with reporters one day after he informed Congress of
plans to nearly halve purchases of the B-2 Stealth bomber and the
C-17 transport jet, and delay production of the Pentagon's next
generation of fighters.
   It was Cheney's most significant step to date in his effort to
realign the nation's military expenditures in response to the
nation's budget woes and the lessened Soviet threat.
   But during his testimony, Cheney also indicated he's looking at
paring the Navy's fleet of aircraft carriers from 14 to 12 and that
he was considering further cuts in Air Force tactical fighter wings.
   These statements come on the heels of disclosures by top Army
officials that they may be forced to trim hundreds of thousands of
soldiers from the force in the coming years.
   Asked about such developments, Cheney noted that the service
chiefs are scheduled to give him their long-term spending plans
next week and that this will set off a debate ``on what we think
that force ought to look like.''
   ``There's clearly going to be a smaller Navy, clearly going to
be a smaller Marine Corps, smaller Army, smaller Air Force,''
Cheney said, adding, ``Obviously, we are looking at a force that is
significantly smaller than it is today.''
   But he added that there are several assumptions that must be
taken into account in any plan to draw down the forces, such as the
successful completion of the talks in Europe to reduce conventional
forces and the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets.
   Cheney's aircraft review called for reducing the proposed number
of B-2 bombers from 132 to 75 and reducing the proposed purchase of
the C-17 long-range transport plane from 210 to 120.
   The defense secretary also called for cutting back on the Navy's
A-12 attack aircraft and delaying purchases of the Air Force's
Advanced Tactical Aircraft and Advanced Tactical Fighter.
   He predicted the changes would trim $2.4 billion from President
Bush's $307 billion defense budget for 1991 and would save $34.8
billion through 1997.
   Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, an Air Force official told a Senate
Armed Services subcommittee Friday that a reduction in the 36
tactical fighter wings by 1996 is likely.
   ``I don't think I can say today whether we'll get below 30, but
we're going to get smaller,'' Maj. Gen. Richard E. Hawley, director
of operations, told the subcommittee on conventional forces and
alliance defense.
   Pressed by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., chairman of the
subcommittee, about whether 30 wings is a fair assumption, Hawley
said: ``I would not be surprised to see numbers in that range.''
   The Air Force official also indicated that Cheney's decision to
delay procurement of the Advanced Tactical Fighter poses a risk but
it was determined that the risk was acceptable.
   ``There is additional risk imposed by slipping the ATF,'' Hawley
said. ``I guess the question is, is it an acceptable risk and I
think the judgment is that it is an acceptable level of risk given
the changing nature of the threat we face.''
   Although Cheney told reporters he was pleased with the response
he'd received during his testimony, he had a blunt message for
those lawmakers who say he's not cutting enough: put up or shut up.
   ``It's easy to pontificate about what the overall top line ought
to be. But as soon as we get down to the real nitty-gritty of how
we're going cut the defense budget ... there's a noticeable lack of
any significant, substantive plans on Capitol Hill,'' the secretary
complained.

   A judge's decision to hold a state official in
contempt for failing to request adequate money for mental health
programs was unusual but probably justified, a former law school
dean said.
   Paul Bender, retired dean of the Arizona State University
College of Law, also said the ruling could spark lawsuits seeking
additional money for other state programs.
   Lawmakers said the ruling likely will result in more money, but
probably much less than the $45.2 million Maricopa County Superior
Court Judge Bernard Dougherty ordered Department of Health Services
Director Ted Williams to request.
   Dougherty ruled Wednesday that Williams was in contempt for
failing to ask for enough money to implement a 1985 court order
requiring the state to provide a full range of services for people
with chronic mental illness.
   The judge likely will sign the order next week, and Williams has
15 days after that to comply. The judge offered no specific
sanctions that he might apply.
   Williams' lawyers said no decision has been made about whether
to appeal.
   ``I don't remember seeing another case like it,'' Bender said.
``The idea of a judge getting involved in the state's budgetary
process is highly unusual. That doesn't mean that I think it's
illegitimate, because I don't think it's illegitimate.''
   Dougherty's ruling stemmed from a petition filed by the Center
for Law in the Public Interest, which originally sought contempt
sanctions against Williams and Gov. Rose Mofford.
   The state Supreme Court dismissed Mrs. Mofford as a defendant on
grounds that she was not a party to the original lawsuit and that
the courts had no authority to tell her what to put in her budget
request to the Legislature.
   Charles Arnold, a Phoenix lawyer who served on a governor's task
force on chronic mental illness, said he believed Dougherty's
ruling ``will provide the impetus'' for legislative action to pay
for the programs.
   ``Of course some legislators will get their feathers up and say,
`No court is going to tell us what to do,''' said Arnold, a
plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit that resulted in the ruling.
``All we can do is hope the good guys prevail.''
   Indeed, House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Wettaw
said: ``The judge is in never-never land.''
   And Senate Majority Leader John Mawhinney said: ``The
Legislature does not respond very well to judicial threats.''
   Still, Bender said he expects Williams to request the $45.2
million from the governor and for Mrs. Mofford to include the
entire amount in an amended budget request to the Legislature.
   ``That will put the onus on the Legislature, and that's a whole
different story,'' Bender said. ``What the Legislature could do is
simply repeal the laws that spell out what services these people
are entitled to. There is nothing to say the Legislature couldn't
do that.''
   House Majority Whip Chris Herstam said he doesn't expect that
``but I'm also not inclined to appropriate the amount of money they
want, because we don't have it.''
   The Legislature already is holding a special session to deal
with a budget deficit estimated at up to $350 million.
   Arnold said he expected the Legislature to provide $16 million
to $25 for the chronically mentally ill next year.
   ``That would be enough to satisfy the court for now and get the
department off the hook,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany on Friday said it would
trim its military spending to help pay for unification but said
East Germany also will have to cut costs for the merger to succeed.
   Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, also
said East Germany should not make unreasonable demands in
negotiations on merging the countries' economies.
   West Germany and East Germany hope to achieve economic unity by
July 2. This would be a giant step toward ending the two countries'
41-year division.
   Seiters predicted basic agreement, based on proposals by Bonn,
as early as next week.
   However, Lothar de Maiziere, East Germany's prime minister, said
his people would face enormous burdens if all subsidies are
immediately eliminated.
   ``We assume that rent, energy and public services will continue
to be subsidized,'' he told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper of East
Berlin before talks with a West German delegation began in the city.
   No details of the six hours of talks were released. They are to
continue Monday in Bonn.
   Guenther Krause, head of the East German delegation, said
agreement was reached on ``many questions.'' But he added ``there
are still open questions.''
   Seiters told West German lawmakers East Germany will have to
hold down public spending for economic union with West Germany to
work.
   ``I stress once again: West Germany is prepared to financially
support East Germany. But as in West Germany, East Germany must
carefully weigh what is financially feasible and what is not,''
Seiters told Parliament.
   Seiters called for cost cutting by state and local governments
and said unification will be financed without any tax increases _
with the help of strong West German economic growth and added
borrowing.
   He said unity costs will also be paid through federal spending
cuts in defense and other areas.
   Seiters said ``re-orienting the armed forces,'' for example,
will yield savings that can be used toward unification.
   He did not elaborate. West Germany is considering reducing its
armed forces from 490,000 to 400,000.
   Regarding monetary union, Bonn proposes exchanging one West
German mark for one East German mark for wages, pensions and
savings up to $2,300. East German savings over that amount would be
exchanged at a 2-1 rate.
   Seiters said all West Germans must be ready to make
contributions toward assisting in the overhaul of East Germany's
battered economy and smoothing the way for unification.
   He said ``basically, this undertaking cannot be compared to any
other.''
   ``We are not underestimating that many difficult problems need
to be solved. With the transition of this washed-up socialist
economy to a social market economy, we are treading in many ways on
unknown turf,'' said Seiters.
   ``Such a task requires from us all our courage, energy,
imagination and politically creative will,'' said Seiters.
   During the same parliamentary session, opposition politicians
accused Kohl of excluding them from participating in the unity
process.
   ``Unification is not a private matter for the federal
chancellor. It is a matter for the whole people,'' said Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin, a top official with the opposition Social
Democrats.

   The circus elephants and clowns cleared out of
Madison Square Garden for a night so that nearly 20,000 people
could gather there to finish a good book they began reading in 1982.
   The book was the Talmud, the repository of age-old Jewish
wisdom, and its readers were Orthodox Jews. Every day for the past
7{ years, each had read a page of the 2,711-page tome, and Thursday
night they converged on the Garden for a read-in to study the last
page.
   ``These are not dead letters of a printed book. They are
alive,'' Rabbi Simon Schwab, of Congregation K'hai Adath Jeshurun
of Manhattan, told the assemblage.
   The daily reading _ known as the Daf Yomi, or daily page _ was
synchronized in 1923, so that Jews all over the world read the same
page on the same day. Thursday marked the end of the ninth reading
of the Talmud since that date; on Friday, the cycle began anew.
   ``Anyone who studies Jewish law every day is guaranteed a place
in the World to Come,'' the text concludes.
   The Talmud is believed to have been given to Moses by God at
Mount Sinai and handed down orally for centuries before it was
transcribed. Commentaries from scholars up to the 17th century are
included.
   It is divided into tracts on agriculture, blessings, civil law,
matters pertaining to women (including marriage and divorce),
holiness and synagogue services, and purity, including foods that
are kosher.
   Many of the readers are laymen, not scholars; they meet in
informal study groups or read pocket editions on subway trains.
   There also are cassette tapes. About 15,000 students around the
world pay $8 a month for Dial-a-Daf, a recorded telephone message
discussing the day's page in English, Yiddish or Hebrew.
   There were gatherings around the world Thursday to mark the end
of the cycle, but the Garden event was the largest. The organizers,
Agudath Israel of America, reserved the Garden two years ago for
the occasion. Thus the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus,
in town for a monthlong stay, was forced to close for the night.
   Many of those attending the ceremony were black-suited Hasidic
Jews, with long beards and unshorn sideburns that grew several
inches long.
   Although Orthodox tradition does not encourage women to study
the Talmud, several hundred sat in the balcony, separated from the
men as they are at Sabbath services. It was the first time women
were invited to the Daf Yomi celebration; one rabbi said they were
welcomed as a gesture of thanks for the sacrifices they made so
their husbands could study.
   ``It's not easy,'' said Jacob I. Friedman, a lawyer who attends
a 6 a.m. study group. ``The alarm rings, and I must get up or I
miss my daily dose of inspiration.''
   There were roughly four times as many participants Thursday
night as there were in 1982, when the last cycle ended.
   ``Next time, we'll fill Yankee Stadium,'' one rabbi said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir left the door
open Friday to another coalition with the rival Labor Party but
said he would prefer a narrow-based government controlled by his
hard-line Likud bloc.
   Shamir, who was given the task of forming Israel's next
government by President Chaim Herzog on Friday, immediately ran
into trouble.
   Yigal Bibi, a legislator of the National Religious Party, said
he would only back Likud if the center-left Labor joined the
coalition. The surprise statement brought the two major parties
back to a 60-60 deadlock in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament.
   Shamir, 74, head of the interim government, said he hoped to
obtain a majority within the next three weeks as required by the
presidential mandate. Speaking to reporters, Shamir said the
prospects for a new Likud-Labor coalition ``at the moment look
unrealistic.''
   ``I would never rule out the possibility'' of a coalition with
Labor, he noted, ``but my efforts in this period won't be aimed at
a national unity government.''
   Likud and Labor ruled in an uneasy partnership as a result of
stalemated elections in 1984 and 1988. The government was brought
down March 15 by a Labor-engineered parliament vote of
no-confidence.
   The crisis was prompted by Shamir's refusal to accept, as Labor
demanded, a U.S. formula for arranging Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Herzog turned to Shamir after Shimon Peres, the Labor leader,
announced Thursday he had failed to assemble a coalition after 35
days of efforts.
   Herzog urged Shamir to act quickly.
   ``These days the country is in a state of political and public
confusion such as it has never known since its founding,'' the
president said. ``There is a heavy and true sense of depression in
the public.''
   The premier hopes to lure three right-wing factions and three
ultra-Orthodox parties into a majority coalition in the Knesset. In
such a coalition, important Cabinet posts are likely to be given to
Likud members, who control 35 seats.
   Likud officials have predicted they would get a majority of 65
seats, apparently by attracting four ultra-Orthodox legislators
from the Labor-aligned Agudat Israel Party.
   Labor has vowed to block Shamir, warning that his prospective
government would be extremist and derail Middle East peace efforts.
   ``It can ruin things in a big way for this country,'' Yitzhak
Rabin, a former Labor premier, said on Israel radio.
   Rabin, a rival of Peres, said Labor was ready to form a joint
government with Likud in order ``to handle the peace issue and
security problems and absorb new immigrants,'' from the Soviet
Union. The number of Soviet Jews immigrating to Israel is expected
to total 100,000 this year.
   Peres has said a Labor-Likud government would not be practical
and insisted that Labor should condition support for any government
on the acceptance of U.S. peace plans.
   Rabin, a Labor hawk who served as defense minister in the last
coalition and took a tough line on the Palestinian uprising,
declined to say whether Peres should step down. But he said
``various changes will be required in the Labor Party.''

<HEAD>Judge Hears Testimony in Lawsuit Over Noisy French Quarter
Musicians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET McCONNAUGHEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police do what they can to enforce noise
limits in the French Quarter, but brass bands quiet down when
officers set up meters to measure their loudness, a city attorney
told a judge Friday.
   ``There's no way we can take the test without the people being
tested aware of it,'' assistant city attorney Ron Sholes told state
District Judge Richard Ganucheau.
   Artists and business people who work in the court have filed
suit against Police Chief Warren Woodfork and seek an order from
Ganucheau instructing police to enforce city noise ordinances in
Jackson Square. The square is in the heart of the French Quarter
and one of this Dixieland jazz capital's prime tourist spots.
   Sidewalk musicians have entertained crowds there for years, but
artists who sell caricatures, instant portraits and bayou scenes in
the quarter say that now too many people play too loudly and too
often.
   They contend that the noise is causing them irreparable damage,
including headaches, stress, loss of sleep and irritability.
   Ganucheau did not indicate when he will rule, but did have some
sharp questions for plaintiff attorney Luke Fontana, who lives and
owns a store in the quarter.
   ``At what point does it become my provenance to tell the
superintendent of police to send his men to control noise in the
French Quarter and ignore cocaine traffic in the Desire Project?
... I would observe that those people whose children are getting
killed in the Desire Project might consider that irreparable harm.''
   He then added: ``This does not indicate my frame of mind.''
   Thoren Rand, a French Quarter caricature artist representing the
Association of Businessmen and Artists of Jackson Square, said
later that the groups that filed the suit aren't asking for extra
officers or time.
   Police already assigned to patrol the area could set up decibel
meters in a store or apartment where the owners had complained of
the noise and do it so that musicians couldn't see them, he said.
   He said police wouldn't even need meters to enforce a law
forbidding noise that can be heard more than 50 feet away.
   Deputy City Attorney Bill Aaron said that if the artists have a
gripe against the musicians, they should sue the musicians.
   ``We don't know who they are or where they live,'' objected
Fontana.

   The Bush administration said Friday that
action by both Lithuanian and Soviet leaders is needed for talks to
begin on the future of the rebellious republic.
   ``We have said all along that dialogue is the only way to solve
this problem,'' Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman,
said. ``Both sides need to find a way to get to that dialogue.''
   On Thursday, France and West Germany jointly urged Lithuania to
suspend its Parliament's moves toward independence as a way of
opening talks with Moscow.
   Asked if the United States supported the proposal by France and
West Germany, the State Department spokesman avoided a direct
response.
   He said the letter by President Francois Mitterrand of France
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany ``represents their
effort to diffuse the situation.''
   Further, Boucher said:
   ``We didn't sign the letter. It's their idea on how to get a
dialogue, and we support anything that could lead to that end.''
   At the same time, though, the State Department spokesman called
for action on both sides.
   ``Both sides need to find a way to get to that dialogue,'' he
said.
   On another subject, the State Department official said the
administration would extend trading privileges to Moscow only if
the Soviets complete legislation guaranteeing the right to travel
and implement such a law.
   The issue was raised after U.S. and Soviet negotiators reached
the outline of an agreement on a trade pact in Paris on Thursday.
Final details could be resolved before President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hold their summit meeting here May
30.
   Boucher said the Soviets were expected to complete the
emigration legislation in late May.

   Despite their obsession with security,
the Shiite Moslem militants holding Western hostages in Lebanon
sometimes bring in doctors from Iranian-funded hospitals to care
for ailing captives, informed sources say.
   American Robert Polhill, freed Sunday, suffered from diabetes.
But apart from loss of weight, a growth on his vocal cords and
malnourishment during his 39 months in captivity, he clearly was
given medication.
   ``The hostages have common health problems such as diabetes,
high blood pressure or high levels of uric acid,'' said a Shiite
physician, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Medicines for such health problems are not a problem. They can
be obtained anywhere in Lebanon,'' he told The Associated Press.
   West German businessman Rudolf Cordes, freed by another Shiite
faction Sept. 12, 1988, after 605 days in captivity, said he often
considered committing suicide when in captivity. His jailers gave
him five tranquilizers a day and brought in a doctor to examine him.
   In January last year, one group was reported to be seeking a
cardiologist to examine an unidentified hostage who was believed to
be suffering from a severe heart condition.
   It underlined that the hostage-holders make some effort to aid
ailing captives, possibly because at least one and maybe two
captives have died from neglect.
   Frenchman Michel Seurat, a researcher, died of a severe illness
believed to be hepatitis in December 1985, released hostages
reported.
   His captors, Islamic Jihad, claimed on March 5, 1986, that they
had killed him in retaliation for France extraditing two
pro-Iranian Iraqi dissidents to Baghdad.
   Briton Alec Collett, a New-York based writer who suffered from
diabetes, is believed to have died in captivity through illness.
   Medical personnel from the Khomeini Hospital in Baalbek in
eastern Lebanon, and clinics run by the fundamentalist
Iranian-backed Hezbollah in Beirut's southern slums are summoned to
help ailing hostages, other Shiite sources said.
   Baalbek and Beirut's southern shantytowns are Shiite strongholds
and most of the 17 Westerners missing in Lebanon are believed to be
held in the slums.
   Various groups hold seven Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans, two Swiss, an Irishman and an Italian. The longest-held
hostage is American Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   While medicine might help treat the hostages' physical ailments,
there is nothing that can be done to alleviate the immense
psychological trauma of being chained day and night, usually
blindfolded, beaten and submitted to mock executions, not to
mention poor food and unsanitary conditions.
   ``You have to learn to master your sadness, your desperation, to
channel your misery,'' former French hostage Jean-Paul Kauffmann
said after he was freed May 4, 1988.
   ``The worst thing for a hostage is not the physical suffering,
but the feeling of having been forgotten.''

   Japan Airlines is offering a new alternative to
in-flight food _ no flight.
   Its new restaurant in Osaka has a full-size replica of a JAL
Boeing 767, a cabin crew, videotapes of travel information and
seats in executive or first- class sections.
   ``For some people, airline food is an oxymoron,'' said airline
spokesman Geoffrey Tudor. ``But we thought there was a group of
people who didn't think so. We're aiming the restaurant at people
who maybe don't travel very much, but want to try out the
experience.''
   Grounded diners have quickly been reserving seats at the
restaurant since it opened this month at the International Garden
and Greenery Exposition in Osaka, officials say.
   Before the meal, customers settle into a row of airplane seats
in a lounge to watch a five-minute videotape of JAL in-flight
service and travel information. A real JAL cabin crew is on duty
``to add a touch of authenticity,'' Tudor said.
   In concessions to comfort, tables take the place of the plastic,
fold-down stands, and diners don't need a seat belt.
   Dominating the main, 106-seat dining room is the Boeing 767
replica, which houses a second-floor ``VIP cabin'' featuring
first-class meals ticketed at $75.
   Tudor said the new restaurant was the latest attempt by the
formerly government-owned airline to brighten its image since going
private in 1987.
   ``This sort of promotion would have been unthinkable four years
ago,'' he said. ``We took surveys and found that a lot of younger
people thought JAL was a pretty stuffy company.''

   Friday's session of the fraud trial of Imelda
Marcos was called off so a hypertension specialist could treat the
former Philippine first lady, who fell ill a day earlier after
testimony about her husband's ouster.
   Although Mrs. Marcos' attorneys had said she was expected in
court Friday, she did not appear on the advice of a doctor who
examined her that morning for high blood pressure.
   ``She said she felt fine, but she didn't look fine to me,'' said
one of her attorneys, Gerald Spence.
   Mrs. Marcos, who turns 61 in July, fell ill during the lunch
break Thursday after a customs agent told of the day in February
1986 when she and her husband, former Philippine president
Ferdinand Marcos, arrived in Hawaii following his ouster from power.
   U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan said the trial would resume
Monday and that Mrs. Marcos would wear a portable heart monitor to
court.
   Keenan said the physician, Dr. David Case, told him in a phone
conversation that it would ``not be a good idea from a health point
of view'' for Mrs. Marcos to continue Friday.
   According to Spence, Mrs. Marcos' blood pressure fluctuated
wildly Thursday after reaching the dangerous level of 230 over 100.
   Spence told reporters that Mrs. Marcos' family had ``a history
of death by stroke.'' He said she would wear the monitor, a small
rectangular box hung over her shoulder, ``wherever she goes.''
   The attorney said Mrs. Marcos had been under extreme stress
because of the trial and the death of her husband last September.
   ``She was with him every day, watching him die, and then she has
had to face this situation alone,'' Spence said. Thursday's
testimony ``just opened the flood gate for her.''
   The U.S. government charges that Mrs. Marcos and her late
husband embezzled $220 million from their country's treasury to
support a life of luxury and investments such as artwork and New
York real estate.
   Mrs. Marcos has pleaded innocent to racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice.
   Her co-defendant, Adnan Khashoggi, is charged with mail fraud
and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping the Marcoses hide
their ownership of an art collection and four Manhattan buildings.

   A 12-year-old computer hacker is accused of
gaining access to the computers of TRW Inc., a national company
that checks customers' credit ratings, and distributing charge card
numbers to computer bulletin boards.
   State police said today that authorities were preparing to
submit a petition to Wayne County Probate Court to charge the youth
of computer fraud and financial transaction fraud.
   The boy's computer and files were seized Thursday from his
Grosse Ile home, said Lt. Tom Meekins, of the Michigan State Police
Criminal Investigation Division.
   ``It won't be hard to prove,'' Meekins said. ``The records we
have indicate he was deeply involved.''
   Authorities talked to the boy in his home but not take him into
custody or charge him, Meekins said. Federal authorities had
originally said that the boy was arrested and charged, but that is
incorrect, Meekins said.
   Authorities were uncertain how many files were tapped, who used
the credit card numbers, and what was purchased with them, said
Michigan State Police Lt. Chris Hogan. But officials said TRW
officials noticed the improper entry to their system and contacted
authorities.
   ``TRW's still trying to figure that one out,'' he said.
   TRW Consumer Relations Supervisor Jean Stevens was not in her
Farmington Hills office this morning to comment, her secretary said.
   The Michigan Computer Crime Task Force of state and federal
authorities said the boy broke through TRW security at a
Detroit-area branch.
   ``Hacking is a common problem and is proliferating as the
computer industry improves and home computers are more available,''
said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent John Britt in Detroit. ``But
tapping into TRW is a new twist and pretty sophisticated.''
   The boy's mother said the family owned the computer for several
years and friends of her son recently taught him how to use it. He
worked on it for up to five hours every weeknight and up to 14
hours on weekends, she said.
   ``He didn't bother me,'' she said. ``He sat there on his
computer. Well, I figured, computers, that's the thing of the day.''

   A federal judge Friday struck down
Oakland's 1988 ``nuclear-free'' ordinance, one of the nation's
strongest measures banning local involvement in nuclear
weapons-related activities.
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin agreed with arguments by the
Bush administration that the measure interfered with the federal
government's constitutional authority over national defense and
atomic energy.
   The ordinance, approved by city voters in November 1988, forbids
most city contracting and investments with nuclear weapons
manufacturers, restricts transportation of nuclear material through
the city and is intended to outlaw nuclear weapons work in the city.
   It is the only such ordinance among more than 160 in the nation
to be challenged in court by the federal government.
   City Attorney Jayne Williams said an appeal would be considered.
City Councilman Wilson Riles Jr., a supporter of the ordinance,
said he was confident much of the measure would be revived by the
9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The ruling does not prohibit the city from limiting its
investments in government securities or posting
``nuclear-free-zone'' signs at its borders. Those provisions were
not challenged by the federal government.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was besieged with
complaints Friday about foul water and air in a city so polluted
that children have drawn pictures of smog and written: ``I don't
want to die!''
   After two days of addressing residents' worries about the
sagging economy in the Ural Mountains city of Sverdlovsk, Gorbachev
traveled to nearby Nizhny Tagil and confronted a new issue:
pollution.
   ``Metal is metal, but people, Mikhail Sergeyevich, are not
iron,'' a metalworker told the president as they met on the shop
floor of the Nizhny Tagil Metallurgical Complex. The comment was
reported by the Tass news agency.
   The city of 403,000 people is among 36 in a government ``black
book'' listing the most polluted areas of the Russian federation,
Pravda reported in September. Other news reports have said smog
from the 45-year-old coke-burning furnaces at the steel complex
burns children's skin as they walk to school and causes serious
lung and heart problems.
   Factories in the area, 900 miles east of Moscow, spew out more
than 600,000 tons of pollutants annually, about 1.5 tons per
resident.
   Local children last year sent the complex's managers drawings of
``smokestacks, smog enveloping living areas and the handwritten
words: `I don't want to die!''' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported.
   Huge demonstrations have been reported in Nizhny Tagil and other
Soviet cities as residents demand a cleanup of air and water.
   They say the pollution was caused by a government policy that
emphasized production at all costs, even at the expense of people's
health.
   The Kremlin chief saw the pollution and its sources first-hand
Friday, taking a walking tour of the sprawling metallurgical
complex, stopping occasionally to field what a Soviet television
correspondent said were thousands of workers' questions.
   Soviet TV's nightly newscast ``Vremya'' showed Gorbachev,
wearing a white hard hat with a visor to protect his eyes from the
intense light, walking past coke furnaces that spewed orange
flames. A camera showed three tall chimneys at the plant spitting
out gray smoke.
   Told by a crowd of shouting residents that the pollution was
less than usual because factories had reduced emissions before
Gorbachev's visit, the president said: ``They say they turned off
something. People are living (here). Surely we could have withstood
one day!''
   A woman interrupted excitedly, ``We've been breathing fresh air
for a week!''
   ``I know about the situation with your water and air,''
Gorbachev responded. He said the solution lies in a government plan
for modernizing local factories' equipment.
   Tass said a 35-year-old lathe operator told Gorbachev at a
Nizhny Tagil factory that makes railroad cars, ``Even a healthy
person like me often has difficulty breathing. And how is it for my
two children, all the children of Nizhny Tagil?''
   Gorbachev said he noticed the pollution as he flew into the city
Friday morning.
   ``As I looked out of the airplane,'' the president said, ``I
immediately understood how neglected the ecology is.''
   Another resident told Gorbachev there isn't one clean reservoir
in the region and trees are ``barbarically cut down,'' Tass
reported.
   The president also heard complaints from the metalworkers about
a shortage of kindergartens, fruits and vegetables, and modern
machinery.
   Gorbachev counseled residents to be patient because the
government faces similar demands from citizens nationwide.
   His wife, Raisa, was shown on TV giving a similar pitch to a
crowd of women that surrounded her during a visit to a museum in
Nizhny Tagil.
   Gorbachev wound up his visit to the Sverdlovsk region and
returned to Moscow on Friday. In televised remarks, he said he had
heard ``many justified demands'' but was convinced the people
believe the solutions lie in his reforms.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Americans to `Get Moving' on Census</HEAD>

   President Bush said Friday that completing the
nation's problem-plagued 1990 census is becoming a ``mammoth
undertaking'' and he urged Americans who haven't returned their
forms to ``get moving.''
   Thirty seven percent of the 95 million census questionnaires
sent in March haven't been returned.
   ``I simply want to ... urge every American who has not returned
the census form to do so; to stand up and be counted,'' Bush said
in remarks to a group of state legislators at the White House.
   ``We really need to get moving on this.''
   In his first comments on the difficulties vexing the U.S. Census
Bureau, Bush said census takers had begun ``to visit all address
from which census forms have not been received, a mammoth
undertaking'' in light of the poor mail response.
   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of a House subcommittee
that oversees the Census Bureau, estimates that fielding the
expanded army of census takers needed to cope with the low return
rate could add $180 million to the $1.3 billion earmarked this year
for conducting the census.
   Bush told the American Legislative Exchange Council that helping
persuade Americans to do a better job of returning their census
forms was ``a project that needs your involvement.''
   ``Census data will help you make important decisions for the
states. And it really fits into this theme of decentralization,
part of the decentralization of government, of putting our trust
where it belongs _ with the people,'' Bush said.
   The census will help determine distribution of hundreds of
billions of dollars in federal and state aid among states and local
communities for the next 10 years.
   It will also be the basis on which congressional and state
legislative district lines will be redrawn. Preliminary data
suggests that as many as 14 of the 435 House of Representative
seats may shift into different states as a result of the 1990 count.
   Some Democratic critics have assailed Bush for not doing enough
to guarantee an accurate census, even though he frequently talks to
Republican audiences about the importance of congressional
redistricting in soldifying GOP gains.
   Some analysts have suggested that a census undercount could work
to the benefit of Republicans.
   The theory is that middle-class households, where response to
the census forms has been generally high, contain a proportionately
larger number of Republicans; and that there is a higher percentage
of Democrats among those not yet counted.
   Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown urged Bush last
week to publicly support a complete census count.
   Bush has taped two public-service television announcements on
the importance of filling out census forms. He also invited cameras
and reporters into the Oval Office to watch him and his wife,
Barbara, fill out their own census forms last month.
   Contributing to the poor return rate was the fact that millions
of Americans never got the forms.
   The Census Bureau on Thursday began its door-to-door survey of
households that had not returned forms. That portion of the head
count is expected to take up to two months.
   People who did not receive a form may get one by calling the
Census Bureau at 1-800-999-1990.

   A Soviet parliamentary delegation, decrying
the secrecy their government imposed after the Chernobyl nuclear
accident four years ago, made an urgent appeal to the United States
and the world Friday for help in dealing with towering medical and
human problems.
   Severe shortages exist in medical equipment, radiological and
other scientific laboratories, radiation detectors, housing for
scores of thousands of relocated people and even baby food, the
five-man delegation said at a news conference at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``The history of mankind never knew an ecological catastrophe
which is so disastrous and having unknown consequences for the
nature, health and life of the present and future generations,''
the delegation said, relaying an appeal made originally by
officials of the Ukraine and endorsed this week by the Supreme
Soviet.
   Yuri N. Shcherbak, chairman of the ecology subcommittee of the
Supreme Soviet and a physician, said it had taken a political
struggle to open secret medical records and uncover the true extent
of the damage caused by the radiation that poured from the
Chernobyl reactor 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.
   The accident, on April 26, 1986, began with a fire in one of
four reactors followed by a core meltdown and an explosion, which
sent huge quantities of radiation billowing into the atmosphere.
   Dr. Shcherbak said thyroid disorders are beginning to appear
along with the first cases of leukemia and cancer, including
thyroid cancer in infants.
   He said serious medical effects are now expected to last
decades, perhaps centuries.
   ``Chernobyl is the gravest warning to all humankind; the warning
that the development of super technology systems may lead to great
damage and perhaps a threat to all living things on earth,'' he
said.
   Kakimbek S. Salykov, chairman of the delegation, said that
deaths attributed to Chernobyl have reached at least 300, compared
to the official report of 31, and that some 150,000 people show
some effects of radiation poisoning.
   But he said the true extent of medical damage may never be known
because a shroud of secrecy was placed on data after the accident
and no statistics were compiled on the effects of radiation on the
600,000 people who took part in the initial cleanup.
   He said that after the accident, the death rate among the 600
workers at the Chernobyl plant ``increased tenfold,'' including
several deaths from cancer.
   Dr. Shcherbak said that 1.5 million people ``got a great dose of
radiation'' and that the leukemia rate in the Kiev area is 2.6
times to 3.8 times greater than before the accident.
   ``Thirteen thousand persons must be relocated as soon as
possible,'' he said.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said that when the effects on
other Soviet republics are taken into account, some 4 million
people may have been exposed to excessive levels of radiation.
   The delegation released these other statistics:
   _12.5 million acres of farmland and 1.5 million acres of forests
in the Ukraine alone were affected by contamination.
   _The contaminated area of the Ukraine contained more than 1,600
towns and villages with more than 1.5 million inhabitants.
   _More than 90,000 people have been resettled from the
contaminated zones to 101 new villages in unaffected areas and
thousands more will be soon.
   _The ``obsolete'' Chernobyl reactors will be shut down
permanently this year or next.

<HEAD>Israel Will Return Heavy Water to Norway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel on Friday agreed to sell back to
Norway a shipment of heavy water it bought 31 years ago rather than
allow an inspection to prove the coolant was not used to make
nuclear weapons.
   ``We have negotiated an agreement that satisfies both sides,''
said Norwegian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset. The
pact removes a longstanding irritant in relations between the two
countries.
   The accord, signed in Oslo by Israeli Ambassador Yehiel Yativ,
obliges Norway to pay about $1.8 million to buy back the remaining
10.5 tons of heavy water.
   Israel purchased 20 tons of the nuclear reactor coolant in 1959
and one ton in 1970 for use at a research reactor in its southern
desert city of Dimona. Inspection rights were written into the
sales contract.
   ``Experts concluded that there is about 10.5 tons left after
evaporation and normal use,'' said Romundset.
   The agreement reached Friday gives Israel one year to drain the
heavy water from its facilities and return it to Norway.
   Heavy water, or deuterium oxide, can be used to convert uranium
into the plutonium used in atomic weapons.
   A former Dimona technician, Mordechai Vanunu, in 1986 charged
that Israel had produced up to 100 nuclear warheads. His allegation
prompted Norway to demand an inspection of Dimona's heavy water.
   Israel refused to open Dimona. It had not allowed a Norwegian
inspection since 1961, according to Norwegian press reports.
   Oslo banned exports of heavy water in March 1989 after learning
that at least three shipments ended up in countries on a Norwegian
blacklist. Fifteen tons were traced to India, which Norway refuses
to supply because the country has nuclear weapons but has not
signed a non-proliferation treaty.
   Norway's sole heavy water supplier, the Norsk Hydro A@S
industrial concern, stopped production a year ago.

   Drag out the Barcolounger, grab the remote
control and hoist that TV Guide. Sweeps season is back.
   J.R. ends up in the looney bin. The ``Twin Peaks'' murder is
finally resolved. ``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``Throw Momma From the
Train'' _ and, hold onto your hats _ ``Return to Green Acres'' all
debut on the little screen.
   There's also the battle of the bios on Sunday night when ABC's
``The Story of the Beach Boys: Summer Dreams'' goes
surfboard-to-mascara with the ``Fall From Grace'' of Jim and Tammy
Bakker on NBC.
   If you've ever wondered just what ``sweeps'' means, don't try to
figure it out. It's a scheme in which local stations monitor their
viewership so they can figure out how much to charge advertisers
for the next season. The sweeps occur four times a year.
   For viewers, all that really matters is that from April 25 to
May 22, there are enough big-name, big-budget movies and
cliffhanger series endings to make the eyes of even the most
hard-core couch potato glaze over.
   In the cliffhanger department, ``Dallas'' ends the season on May
11, with the rotten-but-entertaining J.R. in an insane asylum. Does
he wake up next season and discover it was all a Librium-induced
dream?
   ABC's highly acclaimed ``Twin Peaks'' will resolve the
continuing mystery of who murdered the lumber town's beauty queen,
but the last episode on May 24 will leave audiences hanging on a
different plot line, said ABC spokesman Bob Wright.
   And on ``Cheers,'' Sam pops the big question to Rebecca and
tries to get the bar back in a two-part season capper that ends May
3.
   In the showdown-we've-all-been-waiting-for department, Leland
McKenzie at last takes on Rosalind Shays before the season's last
episode of ``L.A. Law'' on May 17. Any more ground-breaking
segments from the yuppie lawyers who have passed gas, hired sex
surrogates and cursed on American television sets this season?
   Tune in, said executive producer David Kelley, ``I don't think
you'll be disappointed.''
   There's also a glut of docudramas to choose from. ``Voyage of
Terror: The Achille Lauro Affair'' screens May 1 and May 2 in most
areas (it's syndicated). ``Last Flight Out,'' starring James Earl
Jones and Richard Crenna, depicts the Americans who helped U.S. and
Vietnamese citizens escape Saigon in 1975 and will be shown May 20
on NBC.
   ``By Dawn's Early Light'' runs May 19 on HBO and stars Powers
Boothe, Rebecca De Mornay and Martin Landau teetering on the edge
of global annihilation after an unidentified missile destroys a
Soviet city.
   In a more uplifting vein, ``Archie, To Riverdale and Back'' has
the Jughead gang turning ``thirtysomething'' on NBC, May 6. And Eva
Gabor, Eddie Albert and three new Arnold the Pigs (even pigs need
stand-ins) are back in ``Return to Green Acres'' on CBS, May 18.
   There's more...
   The very first ``I Love Lucy'' show _ no, it's not a repeat,
it's the never-before-seen pilot _ is on CBS April 30. And the very
last ``Newhart'' sees the Stratford Inn coveted by Japanese
investors and Bob Newhart and company saying goodbye after eight
years on television.
   New batteries for the remote control, please.

   A man who burned himself to death was sending a
message to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``that Lithuanians will
not live in a Lithuania that is not independent,'' according to
suicide notes released Friday.
   In the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, Russian truckers lay down
in front of their rigs and blocked rush-hour traffic to protest the
Baltic republic's declaration of independence on March 11.
   The suicide victim, Stanislovas Jamaitis, 52, died Thursday of
burns suffered when he doused his clothes with gasoline and set
himself ablaze in front of the Bolshoi Theater in central Moscow.
   Jamaitis, a Lithuanian, left suicide notes to his wife, Stasala,
and to Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis. The Lithuanian
Supreme Council, or parliament, released the texts Friday.
Spokeswoman Rita Radzevicius translated them from Lithuanian to
Russian and read them over the telephone.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass also reported the existence
of the note but did not mention any political motive. Tass said the
letter ``spoke of an impossible family life and a desire to commit
suicide.''
   The version released by Lithuanian authorities apologized for
``something bad'' in his marriage, but stressed political motives.
   ``I went to Moscow to set myself on fire in Red Square,'' he
said. The Bolshoi is a few blocks from Red Square, where security
is heavier.
   ``The occupiers have cut off energy supplies and people are
being thrown out of work,'' wrote Jamaitis, who officials say was
recently laid off.
   ``I have lived my whole life in occupied Lithuania,'' wrote
Jamaitis, who was born two years before the Soviet Union forcibly
annexed Lithuania and its sister republics of Latvia and Estonia
during World War II.
   He was killing himself, he said, to ``let Gorbachev know that
Lithuanians will not live in a Lithuania that is not independent,''
said the note read by Ms. Radzevicius.
   The suicide recalled the 1971 self-immolation of a Lithuanian
student, Romas Kalanta, in the western Lithuanian city of Kaunas.
That act was a symbol of Lithuanian resistance in the 1970s and
1980s, activists say.
   The truck blockade in Vilnius marked a new level of protest by
non-Lithuanians in the republic. Demonstrators lay down in front of
their trucks in the center of Vilnius to protest ``adventurist
decisions'' of the Lithuanian parliament, Tass said.
   Supporters of the Lithuanian popular front Sajudis dragged the
trucks from the streets with tractors, Tass said. It also reported
that local authorities released truckers arrested in the protest to
keep the peace.
   Because of gas shortages caused by the Kremlin blockade,
rush-hour traffic was much lighter than usual Friday. Many people
walked to work or used the city's extensive trolley system.
   The blockade, shown on the Soviet evening TV news show
``Vremya,'' involved about 50 trucks and was organized by members
of a Lithuanian Communist Party splinter that remains loyal to the
Kremlin. Other organizers were members of Yedinstvo, consisting
mostly of Russian residents of Lithuania, said Ms. Radzevicius.
   Just over 80 percent of the republic's population is Lithuanian,
and some Russian, Polish and other minority residents have
expressed fear their rights will be violated.
   Gorbachev has ordered curbs on supplies of oil and natural gas
to Lithuania in an effort to stem the independence movement, and
Lithuanian and Soviet media stressed the hardships caused by the
embargo. Gorbachev also has refused to negotiate with Lithuania.
   Soviet authorities have restricted Western reporters from
traveling to Lithuania, except by invitation on trips organized by
the Foreign Ministry. The Associated Press was not invited on one
trip currently under way.
   In London, maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin criticized
Gorbachev's handling of the Lithuanian independence crisis.
   ``I would consider it immoral to declare an economic blockade in
regard to one of our republics,'' he said. ``Even if it were a
foreign country, Gorbachev wouldn't have behaved in that way
because people would have sat at the negotiating table and would
have sought a way for political settlement.''
   Kremlin officials have said Lithuania might become independent,
but at a slower pace, and Gorbachev's actions appear designed to
stem secessionist movements in other republics.
   The parliament of Estonia has voted to become independent at an
unspecified later date, and Latvia is scheduled to vote on the
issue next week.
   An Estonian delegation met Friday with Alexander Yakovlev, a
Gorbachev aide, to discuss the independence of the Baltic states,
the Estonian News Service reported. The non-governmental news
outlet said Yakovlev suggested Estonia suspend its drive for
independence and hold a referendum on the issue, but did not demand
the republic renounce its recent decisions.
   In Brussels, Lithuanian parliamentarians Friday asked Belgium to
help offset Moscow's economic blockade.
   Lithuanian President Landsbergis weighed a proposal from France
and West Germany that Lithuania temporarily suspend its
secessionist actions ``so that the current crisis ends in a
solution acceptable to all parties.''
   Lithuania wants an immediate dialogue, Landsbergis said, and ``a
termination of the Soviet economic blockade against Lithuania would
be beneficial to the atmosphere of this dialogue.''

<HEAD>Labor Pushes OSHA Changes on Workers Memorial Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Harold Gallegos says he still spits up blood
and endures rashes, blurred vision and kidney pains that began two
years ago after he cleaned out a highway pit contaminated with
toxic chemicals.
   As a Colorado state employee, Gallegos was not covered by
federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration laws that
require employers to tell workers what kind of hazards they face on
the job.
   Workers such as Gallegos would know their job risks under
proposed OSHA changes being pushed by labor unions as they
commemorate Workers' Memorial Day on Saturday. The day also marks
the 20th anniversary of Congress' creation of OSHA.
   In Gallegos' case, after cleaning the highway pit he learned
that it contained such heavy metals as arsenic, zinc and cadmium
and that an EPA clean-up site contaminated with radioactive waste
was just a few hundred feet away.
   The Colorado Department of Highways did not do anything
inappropriate because the state had cleaned the same pump house for
years without incident, spokesman Dan Hopkins said. The source of
the contamination is still being investigated, he said.
   ``There was never any indication of any hazard. We were shocked
when we detected the contamination,'' Hopkins said in a telephone
interview.
   Nevertheless, the state now tests ground water and sand before
cleaning similar pump houses and contracts the work out to
hazardous substance specialists as a precaution, Hopkins said.
   Gallegos has not filed suit and the state has paid his medical
bills and provided him leave, including three days to visit
Washington and spotlight attention on the 10,000 workers killed
each year on the job and some 70,000 others who have been
permanently disabled by workplace accidents.
   Under OSHA revisions being pushed by the AFL-CIO, state and
local employees and millions of other workers who currently don't
fall under the federal law would have to be informed about their
job risks.
   The 14.2 million-member federation also is calling on Congress
to require OSHA to increase penalties and enforcement authority;
improve record-keeping of job injuries and illnesses; and impose
stronger safety and health standards in some industries.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole is reviewing the proposed OSHA
changes and wrote a letter this week to AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland pledging to ``find ways to increase effectiveness and
implement improvements'' for OSHA enforcement.
   Labor's supporters generally praise Mrs. Dole's commitment to
workplace safety and consider her efforts a vast improvement over
the neglect they felt OSHA received under President Ronald Reagan.
   Next week, Senate labor subcommittee chairman Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, will hold a hearing on various proposals to strengthen OSHA
laws, including one to increase criminal penalties.
   Metzenbaum said that during OSHA's first 18 years of existence,
200,000 American workers were killed on the job. Many of the deaths
were the result of willful violations of OSHA laws, but ``not one
employer spent one night in jail,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Right now, the maximum criminal penalty for an employer who
willfully violates federal safety laws, when the violation results
in death, is six months in jail. Metzenbaum's proposal would
increase that to 10 years.
   Metzenbaum noted that last weekend, millions of Americans
celebrated Earth Day in a push for tough enforcement of
environmental laws.
   ``I applaud their actions. But if we throw corporate criminals
in jail for harming our trees and animals and water, we also should
throw them in jail for killing and maiming our workers,''
Metzenbaum said.
   The AFL-CIO, which created the first Workers Memorial Day last
year, plans to hold ceremonies in 100 communities around the nation
on Saturday.

   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez
called on the Organization of American States on Friday to play a
role in bringing about an easing of tensions between the United
States and Cuba.
   ``Thirty years of confrontation and tension between Cuba and the
United States will not disappear overnight,'' Perez said in a
speech to the OAS permanent council. ``But the OAS could create a
climate for facilitating a dialogue.''
   While results over the short term are not likely, Perez said it
is possible for the two governments to find an agenda for detente
and eventually an agenda for cooperation.
   Perez, who is here on an official visit, made the recommendation
as part of a broader proposal for revitalizing the OAS.
   Relations between the United States and Cuba have worsened in
recent months. The Bush administration has shown little interest in
opening a dialogue on reaching an accommodation.

   Troops fired at rock-throwing demonstrators in the
disputed southern territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, the official Tass
news agency reported Friday. Two civilians and seven soldiers and
police were injured, it said.
   Tass said the incident occurred Thursday night incident in
Stepanakert, capital of the mainly Armenian enclave located inside
Azerbaijan.
   The news agency said about 1,000 people gathered outside the
military commandant's office to demand the release of two Armenians
detained for addressing a rally earlier in the week. State of
emergency regulations in effect in the district forbid mass
demonstrations.
   The troops had used shields to move the crowd away from the
square in front of the commandant's office but were hit by stones
before they began shooting, the news agency reported.
   Among the injured were five Interior Ministry troops, two
policemen and two civilians, Tass said. One of the civilians
suffered a gunshot wound, it said, without elaborating.
   Nagorno-Karabakh has been at the center of a territorial dispute
between ethnic Armenians who dominate the region's population and
Azerbaijanis since February 1988.
   Armenians demand that the region be put under control of the
Armenian republic, while Azerbaijanis say it should be in their
hands. Violence, strikes and demonstrations have erupted repeatedly.

   Meat packers increased the share of cattle

the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   About 26.2 million steers and heifers were slaughtered in 1989,
said the department's Agricultural Marketing Service. Of that
number, 23.7 million head, or more than 90 percent, were
slaughtered by the top 15 companies, which were required to file
reports with the agency.
   The information collected showed that ``captive supplies'' of
cattle owned or controlled by the companies increased to a 22.4
percent share last year from 19.3 percent in 1988, the agency said
in a report.
   ``While packing firms and plants have grown over the past few
years, the supply of slaughter livestock has been reduced,'' the
report said. ``Increased capacity for processing, along with
reduced cattle numbers, force packers to actively seek the
available cattle.''
   Packers get captive supplies through their own cattle feeding
programs, forward contracting with other producers and marketing
agreements with feeders.

<TEXT>
   Sixteen pelicans found dead near here
were killed by lightning, wildlife officials said.
   ``It's unusual for this to occur,'' said game warden Joe Ulrich,
who investigated the birds' deaths southeast of Broadwater. He said
weather patterns seldom have such an impact on migrating birds.
   Pelicans, which are not unusual in Nebraska, are mong the
largest of all flying birds. They have wingspans of up to 9 feet.
   The American white pelicans probably were flying at an altitude
of several hundred feet when they were caught in a thunderstorm
earlier this week, said Dr. Stephen Kerr, a Gering veterinarian and
wildlife enthusiast who examined the birds.
   ``It's unusual because birds usually avoid bad weather,'' he
said Thursday.
   Kerr said his examination showed that the birds died before
hitting the ground. Marks on some of their plumage showed probable
contact with an electrical current, he said.

   Officers at this U.S. Navy
communications station near Athens destroyed a giant
telecommunications antenna on Friday, symbolically marking the
base's closure, the U.S. Embassy said.
   The United States announced this year it would shut down the Nea
Makri base and the Hellinikon Air Force base adjacent to Athens
Airport as part of a worldwide reduction of U.S. military
installations.
   About 300 people _ servicemen, dependents and Greeks from nearby
villages _ gathered for the toppling of the 660-foot antenna and
for a picnic later.
   The antenna came crashing down, folding in on itself, when base
commander Capt. Charles Voltaba III of Berwyn, Ill., ordered its
supporting struts released.
   Nea Makri base, 24 miles northeast of Athens, was established in
1963 as a radio transmitting and receiving relay station in support
of the 6th Fleet.
   It is one of four major military bases installed in Greece under
terms of a defense agreement begun in the 1950s and renewed
periodically since.
   Talks on a new defense agreement are expected to begin in May.
   The conservative New Democracy Party, which won elections April
8, has said it supports a continued U.S. military presence.

   Cuban authorities arrested eight people,
including Americans, and seized 110 pounds of cocaine in a cocaine
bust, the Mexican government news agency Notimex reported Friday.
   A dispatch from Havana, monitored in Mexico City, did not
identify those arrested other than to say they were Colombians,
Americans and Cubans living in the United States who arrived in
Cuba in two speedboats from Florida.
   It quoted an Interior Ministry communique as saying the cocaine
was found buried in Cruz Key, a beach in Camaguay province about
380 miles east of Havana. The communique said the drug was
confiscated between March 19 and April 23, but it gave no details.

<HEAD>Mystery Surrounds Disappearance of Chinese Farmers from Airport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATHOL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities on Friday searched fruitlessly
for seven Chinese peasants reported abducted upon arriving in this
country. Suspicions rose that they may have been trying to escape
China.
   Adding to the mystery was the question of why the Chinese were
being brought to a farm in this remote western Massachusetts town
to study organic agriculture, an art that has been practiced in
their country for centuries.
   ``The Chinese have never really had a foreign exchange to buy
chemicals. They are really knowledgeable from a millenium of
organic farming,'' said state Agriculture Commissioner August
Schumacher Jr.
   The seven missing Chinese were among a group of 16 farmers who
were brought here by Molly Aitken, president of the World Energy
Foundation and owner of Green Gables Farm, a modest spread on the
outskirts of town.
   Federal authorities investigating the disappearance at New
York's Kennedy International Airport say they suspect it may have
been a scheme to get away from the group and stay in the United
States.
   But Aitken said Thursday she trusted the seven and believes foul
play was involved. She said she and the Chinese government selected
the group.
   ``I cannot believe they would deliberately jeopardize our
project by running off,'' she said. ``They were very excited about
the project. It doesn't make any sense for them to want to do
this.''
   The group was from Fujian Province in southern China. The seven
missing men are in their late 20s and early 30s and are married
with families in China, Aitken said. The remaining farmers were
staying at her farm Friday.
   Aitken said she was greeting the group at the airport Wednesday
night when she noticed several were being herded off by three men.
The alleged abductors, apparently unarmed, were yelling orders in
Chinese.
   The men took the farmers across the crowded lobby, out the
terminal doors and into a waiting compact car.
   Port Authority spokesman Armando Arrastia in New York said
Friday investigators were searching for the getaway car, which was
registered in Morristown, N.J., to a man named Xueduan Chen, about
30 years old.
   Authorities were trying to locate the owner, said Sgt. Thomas
O'Reilly, a detective with the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which operates the airport.
   Several law enforcement officials said they were reluctant to
characterize the incident at Kennedy.
   ``There's something wrong here,'' said Duke Austin, a spokesman
for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Washington. ``If
there were other Asians there with cars, they must have known these
people were coming.''
   The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment Friday afternoon.
   Michael Ming Cui, an associate of Aitken's, suggested that
overseas relatives of the men may have grabbed them for cheap
labor. Austin, however, said the INS knew of no incidents in which
Chinese nationals were kidnapped as they entered this country.
   Cui said it is true the Chinese are expert in organic farming,
but the visiting farmers were here to learn more sophisticated
techniques such as solar-powered greenhouses and hydroponics.
   Cui said he doubted the disappearance was an attempt at illegal
immigration. He pointed to Chinese immigration papers that showed
that at least one member of the group had been cleared of
involvement in last year's student-led pro-democracy movement in
Beijing, which was crushed by the government.
   The farmers had been allowed into the United States on temporary
H-3 work visas intended for people in practical training programs.
   Working with the Beijing Vegetable Research Center, Aitken plans
to build a model Third World village on her property, said Cui, an
American-educated Chinese whose mother is affiliated with the
center.
   He said the project originally was intended to be conducted in
China, but supporters backed out after the government crackdown on
pro-democracy students.
   Aitken said the World Energy Foundation is a New York-based,
non-profit group that promotes the efficient use of energy and
rural electrification in underdeveloped countries.

<HEAD>Kent State Reconsiders, Puts Victim Names at May 4 Shooting
Memorial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENT, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kent State University, under pressure from
angry parents, has agreed that a memorial to be dedicated to the
students killed and wounded in a 1970 anti-war protest will include
a plaque inscribed with their names.
   The announcement was made Thursday by the university president,
Michael Schwartz. The granite plaque was placed near the hillside
memorial in preparation for the dedication ceremony on May 4, the
20th anniversary of the shootings.
   Schwartz made the decision after discussing the issue Wednesday
with Martin and Sarah Scheuer, the parents of one of the slain
students, Sandra Scheuer of Boardman, said Janet Thiede, a
university spokeswoman.
   In an interview with The Associated Press published last week,
Mrs. Scheuer expressed anger that no names were carved in the
reddish granite of the memorial.
   ``What good is a memorial if they don't have their names?'' Mrs.
Scheuer said. ``The Vietnam Memorial has names. Maybe the
university just wants to forget about it _ 20 years is probably
enough, they'll probably think.''
   Schwartz said the plaque was inscribed, ``In loving memory of:
Allison Krause, Jeffrey Miller, Sandra Scheuer and William
Schroeder,'' who were killed by Ohio National Guardsmen on May 4,
1970.
   Referring to the wounded students, the plaque also says,
``Respectfully remembered: Alan Canfora, John Cleary, Thomas Grace,
Dean Kahler, Joseph Lewis, Donald MacKenzie, James Russell, Robert
Stamps and Douglass Wrentmore.''
   ``The plaque will speak to what happened here at Kent while
Bruno Ast's design will speak to the larger issue of the disruption
going on in our country at that time and the impact the events here
had on our nation,'' Schwartz said in a statement.
   The plaque was placed near the sidewalk north of the memorial
plaza.
   Ms. Thiede, the university spokeswoman, said none of the
finalists in the architectural design competition had called for
including the names of the victims on the memorial.
   The memorial plaza, made of granite, is built on a 2{-acre site
atop a hill. It consists of four standing slabs of increasing size
that spread out from the center, signifying that the impact of May
4, 1970, spread far beyond Kent State.
   Ast's name appears on the memorial along with the words
``Inquire, Learn, Reflect,'' which the university has outlined as
its goal in building the memorial.
   The memorial, which cost $200,000, was scaled down from a $1
million proposal that the university said it had been unable to
finance through private fund-raising.

   William Bennett, the nation's drug czar,
said Friday that orphanages and youth camps may become sanctuaries
for youngsters facing ``systematic child abuse'' in drug-plagued
homes and neighborhoods.
   ``We may just have to find some way for children to get out of
the environment they are in to go to orphanages, to go to Boys
Towns, to institutions where they will be raised and nurtured,''
Bennett told about 3,000 delegates to a world drug conference.
   ``There are communities in America where children are not being
raised at all.''
   But Bennett offered no details about how children would be
separated from families or what facilities would be used under such
as plan.
   ``I think before this is over we will see a dramatic increase in
orphanages,'' he said. ``No one is a stronger proponent of family.
But when it reaches a level of systematic child abuse, we have got
to do something.''
   Nearly 7,000 adults and children attended the 13th annual
conference sponsored by the Atlanta-based Parent Resource Institute
for Drug Education. The convention ends Saturday.
   Bennett stressed drug education for young people but vigorously
opposed any efforts to legalize drugs or weaken present laws.
   He also charged the nation's colleges have ducked responsibility
in the battle against drug use.
   ``It's interesting how many of these colleges want to take on
ethnocentrism, racism and sexism, but when we ask them about drugs
they say it's a societywide problem and they can't do anything
about it,'' he said.
   ``They can certainly do something about it, such as adopting
strong rules and strong principles.''

   Two Michigan food processors are voluntarily
recalling 3,500 pounds of sausage because the products may contain
sulfite, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Dave's Sausage Factory in Detroit recalled 3,000 pounds, and
Mancini Sausage Co. in Harpers Woods 500 pounds, officials said.
   ``Sulfites can pose serious health risks for people who are
sensitive to these compounds,'' said Lester M. Crawford, head of
the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
   The sausage links produced by Dave's are sold under the names
``Wisbisky's Polish Sausage,'' ``Vetro's Italian Sausage'' and
``Dave's Pork Links.''
   The first two products are sold in clear plastic bags and weigh
about 1{ pounds each. The label shows the product name and has
``Est. 10198'' printed inside the USDA inspection seal.
   ``Dave's Pork Links'' are repackaged by stores and may be sold
under a private brand name, Crawford said. All three products are
distributed to grocery stores, delicatessens and restaurants in
Michigan.
   The Mancini Sausage Co. product is sold only to delicatessens
under the name, ``Polish Brand Sausage'' and is also in clear
plastic bags, with a weight of 1{ pounds each. White printing on
the bag shows the product name, ``Est. 10210'' printed inside the
inspection seal, and the words ``produced by Mancini Sausage
Company.''
   ``Although no illnesses have been reported, we urge consumers to
immediately return the sausage to the place of purchase,'' Crawford
said. ``Consumers who suspect they may have purchased `Dave's Pork
Links' under another brand name should ask the seller where the
sausage came from and return it if necessary.''
   Grocery store managers, delis and restaurants should return the
meat to the distributor.
   ``Sulfites are not permitted as direct additives to meat or
poultry food products,'' Crawford said. ``When ingredients that
contain sulfites are added to a meat poultry product, such as
vegetables in a stew, sulfites must be listed in the ingredients
statement on the label.''
   However, he said, pork sausage does not contain any ingredients
to which sulfites would normally be added.
   Consumers with question about the recall may phone the toll-free
USDA hotline at 1-800-535-4555 Monday through Friday from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. EDT. At other times a recording with information about
the recall will be provided, officials said.
   Callers in the Washington, D.C., area should call 447-3333.

   Donald Trump, the king of glitzy real estate and
casinos, now says he wants to become the king of cash.
   The tycoon said Friday he has discussed selling or refinancing
virtually every major asset he owns to raise money to buy new
properties. Trump said he has hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to
negotiate a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle less than a year
after buying the airline from Eastern Airlines.
   ``If I got the right offer, I would consider selling it,'' Trump
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
   Trump was confirming remarks made to the Wall Street Journal,
which published details of his financial plans in a story Friday
after its own interview with him. The Journal's account said Trump
was so adamant about his cash strength he threatened to sue the
newspaper if it suggested otherwise.
   Speculation about Trump's net worth and business intentions have
gathered momentum ever since his marital problems became the latest
gossip-tabloid fodder earlier this year.
   Forbes magazine, for example, says it has slashed an estimate of
Trump's net worth by more than $1 billion, to around $500 million.
In its May 14 cover story, which Forbes made available Friday, the
magazine says it revised the estimate after examining nonpublic
documents submitted by Trump last year to a government body, which
Forbes declined to specify.
   The article questions whether Trump's cash flow is sufficient to
cover the debt and interest payments from his vast holdings.
   Trump denied that his empire faces any cash shortage problems,
saying he has cash reserves of $380 million.
   ``I'm very liquid now,'' he told the AP. ``I want to build up
cash because I think cash is going to be king.''
   He did not elaborate, but said he is interested in raising cash
so that he will have funds on hand in the future to acquire
additional properties.
   Among Trump's assets are New York's Plaza Hotel, the glitzy
Trump Tower skyscraper on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, and casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., including the $1 billion Taj Mahal casino,
which recently opened with much fanfare.
   Some people in the financial community are watching for signs
that Trump might be accumulating cash to cope with a current or
anticipated cash crunch caused by a heavy debt load.
   ``He's in a cash squeeze. Why else is he doing this?'' said a
hotel industry analyst.
   He and other analysts spoke on condition they not be identified,
partly out of fear of arousing Trump's lawsuit threats against
people whose views he doesn't like.
   Last month, gaming industry analyst Marvin Roffman was fired by
his firm, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia, after he
made negative comments published in the Journal about the Taj
Mahal's long-term prospects. Trump threatened to sue the firm and
Roffman was fired after he rescinded his initial written apology to
the developer.
   Several of Trump's biggest holdings don't produce enough income
to cover interest payments on loans taken out to pay for
acquisitions. This means that Trump relies heavily on cash cows,
such as casinos and condominiums, according to the Journal article.
   The Plaza and Trump Tower will not be sold, Trump said.

   The ninth annual international gathering of
crew cuts was abuzz with tales of the perils involved in keeping
closely cropped.
   The crew assembled at the restaurant where it all began when
someone told one of the group's originators, Jerry Brown: ``You
crew cuts are a dying breed.''
   To prove that wrong, Brown began recruiting people with crew
cuts for the annual gatherings and found they all carry a sense of
pride.
   ``Not too many are shy individuals. Maybe it has something to do
with the hair standing erect,'' Brown said.
   Brown even went so far as to get Gov. Rudy Perpich to declare
Thursday Crew Cut Day in Minnesota.
   The 20 who congregated swapped haircut tales Thursday night.
   Brown remembered going into a Washington, D.C., barber shop and
the barber's ``hand was shaking so bad. I walked out of there, and
my head was like the Rocky Mountains.''
   Brown said people with long hair can have the length uneven by a
quarter inch and it's hardly noticeable. Not so with a crew cut.
   ``One slip and you could draw blood,'' Brown said.
   Among the first-timers was Russ Mansmith of Wyoming, Minn., who
said:
   ``I've had a crew cut since 1940 except for a six-month period
in eighth grade. That was my rebellious period.''

   Any plans to visit Kresge College,
part of the University of California, Santa Cruz, will require a
passport and visa.
   Students at Kresge, one of eight UCSC residential colleges,
voted overwhelmingly this week _ 306-79 _ to secede from the main
campus.
   The students on Thursday were making plans to issue passports
and entry visas. They also intend to set up toll booths at ``border
checkpoints.''
   It all started with a ballot measure that sought a secession.
Initially, it was considered a ``symbolic initiative,'' but Steve
Parks, chairman of the Kresge Student Parliament, said, ``We're
going to take this thing a bit further.'' Hence, the toll booths
and visas.
   The ballot measure blasts school administrators as ``managers
and demagogues rather than the visionaries and idealists'' who
established the university among the redwoods above downtown Santa
Cruz in the 1960s.
   ``We secede in the name of the environment; we secede in the
name of the Earth,'' stated the initiative.
   Parks said the secessionist movement was spurred, among other
things, by concerns about fast campus growth.
   A UCSC spokesman said administrators are baffled.
   ``We are not sure what this means,'' said John Harvith, the
school's assistant director of public information.

   The Rev. Calvin McCutcheon has two
purposes in life. One: his congregation. The other: fleecing sheep.
   Both are sheer pleasure, he says.
   ``The two things I've done in my life are preach and shear
sheep,'' said McCutcheon, 52. ``I try to feed my flocks as well as
fleece them.''
   A Methodist minister, McCutcheon has been pulling the wool off
of eyes since he was 14, when it took him 25 minutes to strip a
sheep.
   His skills were on display at the fifth annual Sheep to Shawl,
an agricultural exhibit earlier this week at Fayette Plateau
Vocational-Technical Center.
   Shearing and preaching have plenty in common, McCutcheon says.
   At least three Bible verses speak about the relationship between
God and man using the word shepherd, he said.
   ``I understand that better because I've sheared sheep,''
McCutcheon said.
   McCutcheon is a seven-time state champion, and once sheared 300
in one day.
   His fastest official time is one minute, 19 seconds.
   He charges $1.75 a head, and has sheared throughout West
Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Indiana and
Illinois.
   But he said he's too busy looking after his own flocks at
Memorial United Methodist Church in Summersville and Bennett
Memorial United Methodist in Glade Creek to keep his own sheep.

   Sen. Robert C. Byrd was honored Friday for
casting more votes than anyone in Senate history.
   Byrd's vote on an amendment to a $3.4 billion supplemental
spending bill was No. 12,134.
   The West Virginia Democrat cast his first vote on Jan. 7, 1959,
on a procedural matter.
   ``Senator Byrd has maintained a voting attendance record of 98.4
percent during his Senate service,'' said Senate Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell of Maine in a tribute on the Senate floor.
   The previous record was held by former Sen. William Proxmire,
D-Wis., who cast 12,133 votes during his 31 years in the Senate.
   Among those praising Byrd was Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., who
at 87 is the oldest member of the Senate.
   ``He has made a remarkable record in the Senate,'' Thurmond
said. ``He is one of the ablest parliamentarians who has ever
served ... throughout the history of the Senate.''
   Byrd, 72, responded to the tribute by saying: ``Records are made
to be broken, and this record will be broken in time.''
   The former majority leader is a Senate historian and
accomplished fiddler.
   Proxmire is still a record-holder. He cast 10,261 consecutive
votes from 1966 to 1988, and had a 99.85 percent voting attendance
record, according to Senate records.
   Byrd went back to business after the tribute, delivering a
speech criticizing the Bush administration for not finding Japan in
violation of trade agreements.

   A semi-trailer carrying 16 Harpoon missiles
with unarmed non-nuclear warheads was sideswiped by another truck
on a highway, injuring two people, officials said Friday. No
explosion or fire was reported.
   The accident on Interstate 64 in eastern Kentucky didn't pose a
substantial threat to the area, but a section of the road was shut
down for about 9{ hours, said state police and state Disaster and
Emergency Services officials.
   U.S. Army explosives experts from Fort Knox arrived by
helicopter early Friday to inspect the wreckage. The accident was
reported at 11:30 p.m. EST Thursday.
   The interstate was reopened about 9 a.m. Friday after the
trailer rig containing the rockets was towed under state police
escort to the Lexington Blue Grass Army Depot, said Kentucky State
Police trooper Gary Kistner.
   In Washington, Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a U.S. Navy spokesman,
said 16 Harpoon missiles were being shipped from the Yorktown, Va.,
Naval Weapons Station to the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics plant
in St. Charles, Mo., a St. Louis suburb.
   The weapons, complete with non-nuclear 500-pound warheads and
guidance systems, would have required further procedures before
they were battle-ready, he said.
   Each missile is shipped in a separate container ``designed to
cradle the missile ... so that accidents of this nature will not
yield an explosion,'' he said.
   The missile's protective canisters were not broken but were
undergoing inspection at the Blue Grass Army Depot, said depot
spokesman Robert Armogeda.
   Harpoon missiles are a type of cruise missile that can be
launched from ships, submarines or aircraft. The 15-foot-long
weapon is considered a medium-range anti-ship missile.
   A truck and trailer rig driven by Charles Harrell, 49, of
Phillipsburg, Mo., was carrying the missiles when it was sideswiped
by a rig driven by Jimmy Scott, 55, of Florrissant, Mo., Kistner
said.
   Scott, a driver for J.B. Hunt Transport of Lowell, Ark.,
apparently lost control of his rig and crossed the highway's
median, colliding with the tractor portion of the missile truck,
Kistner said.
   Scott was listed in serious but stable condition in the
intensive care unit of King's Daughter's Medical Center in Ashland,
said nursing supervisor Sherry Swimm. The driver's wife, Marian
Scott, 55, was treated for injuries and released.
   Harrell, a driver for Diablo Transportation Inc. of Pacheco,
Calif., and a passenger were not injured.

<HEAD>New York State Halts Deposits at Five Sperm Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Health Department said Friday it has
barred deposits at five sperm banks, including two being sued by
women who say they were impregnated by the wrong sperm.
   In a letter delivered Wednesday, each bank was told to ``cease
collecting and processing human semen for artificial insemination
and to either destroy all anonymous semen samples or hold them
until ... it meets requirements for (anonymous) donor screening and
testing.''
   Authorities said none of the banks had applied for a state
license as required by a regulation that took effect in October.
   The banks, all in Manhattan, included Advanced Fertility
Services, which has been sued by Julia Skolnick, and University
Fertility Center of Research, which has been sued by a married
couple identified in court papers as Jane and John Doe.
   Mrs. Skolnick gave birth to a daughter who is half black. Mrs.
Skolnick is white, as was her late husband, whose sperm was
supposed to have been used in the insemination.
   Jane Doe sued University after she gave birth to a child whose
blood type allegedly did not match her's or her husband. She
arranged to be impregnated by his sperm.
   The three other banks were Fertility Research Foundation, the
Fertility Institute of New York, and the Mary Wilson Fertility
Center.
   According to investigators, the most serious problems were at
Advanced Fertility. The investigators said there was no evidence:
   _that Advanced Fertility quarantined semen from anonymous donors
for six months before it was used;
   _that donors were given appropriate physical exams;
   _that semen was frozen within an hour of collection;
   _that semen was screened for HTLV-I, a virus linked to leukemia
that can be sexually transmitted.
   In addition, the bank failed to apply for a state license even
after it being told, said Maryanne Gardineer, a Health Department
regulator.
   Robert Whittaker, a lawyer for the bank, said its operator, Dr.
Hugh Melnick, ``is working with the state and has indicated that
whatever bookkeeping problems exist will be corrected.''
   Vicki Zeldin, a health department spokeswoman, said Advanced
Fertility ``claimed these were only paperwork problems, but if they
can't document that something happened, how do we know they did
it?''
   Ms. Gardineer declined to comment on a report published earlier
this week that investigators also found semen at the bank bearing
the code of Mrs. Skolnick's husband. Mrs. Skolnick says she was
told by the bank that all of her husband's semen there had been
used; she says the finding is proof that she was artificially
inseminated with the wrong sperm.
   Mrs. Skolnick also has sued Idant Laboratories, where her
husband deposited his sperm and which was supposed to send it to
Advanced Fertility for insemination. Ms. Gardineer said the state's
review of Idant, New York's largest sperm bank, was not finished.
   Investigators found that Wilson Fertility was using fresh semen
that had neither been frozen nor quarantined, Ms. Gardineer said.
   Ian Wilson of Wilson Fertility said fresh semen is more
effective than frozen, and he complained that the state order would
inconvenience patients without increasing safeguards against
disease.
   Zeldin said the three other banks were cited because they had
not applied for the license.
   Ms. Gardineer said she does not know how many semen banks
operate in the state. So far license applications have been
received from nine banks, including five in other states.
   Officials at University said it no longer collected semen.
   The state's order only bars the five banks from collecting or
processing semen, not from releasing semen already on deposit.
Accordingly, the move does not affect semen of known donors like
those involved in the two lawsuits.
   But sperm banks' record keeping is at the heart of those cases,
and Ms. Gardineer said the inspections raised questions.
   ``You should be able to trace semen much in the same way you can
blood,'' she said. ``But from what we've seen, the paper trail just
isn't there.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author-in-hiding Salman Rushdie said Friday he
misses everyday pleasures like taking a walk, but will not allow
his prison-like circumstances to defeat him.
   In a telephone interview with BBC radio, the British author of
``The Satanic Verses'' also said he finds it odd no one has been
prosecuted for making the threats that keep him in hiding 14 months
after Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini imposed a death sentence.
   ``I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that people have been
prosecuted for incitement in the past on less grounds than this,''
he said. ``I see what everyone else has seen on television and I
find it hard to believe that's not sufficient evidence.''
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said in reply to a question at a news conference
Friday that the death sentence stands and has been supported by the
Islamic world.
   Khomeini, Iran's spiritual and revolutionary leader, condemned
Rushdie's novel as blaspheming Islam. Khomeini died June 3, but
Iranian authorities reaffirmed his death decree, and Iranian
clerics offered millions of dollars to anyone who killed Rushdie.
Some British Moslems have expressed support for Khomeini's decree.
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, is not a practicing
Moslem.
   Asked how he was coping with life in hiding and under guard,
Rushdie said, ``Well, it's amazing what people can get used to.
   ``I'm doing my work, and I suppose that keeps me going. But I
would like to think that this isn't a permanent condition. ... It
is a very difficult situation, but I don't intend to be defeated by
it.
   ``I spend my life reading and writing. It's a simple life,'' he
said. ``I get up in the morning and I work, and I do whatever you
might do if your life were confined to the interior of a house.''
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said it was the 42-year-old
writer's first broadcast interview since the Feb. 14, 1989, death
threat drove him into hiding.
   Rushdie said he regards the confines of his safehouse as a
prison.
   ``The fact that I cannot leave the house is a colossal
restriction, and is, indeed, a loss of freedom, '' he said.
   ``The worst about it is the loss of ordinary life. The worst
about it is not being able to do things that everybody else would
take for granted, like walking down a street.''
   Rushdie said he has finished a novel for older children, and a
selection of his essays and criticisms.
   ``When I've had a bit of a rest, (I) try to dive into a grownup
novel,'' Rushdie said.
   He gave no indication of where he was.
   Rushdie indicated it was not his responsibility to bring the
campaign against him to an end. He called it a political problem
``that needs to be solved at the political level, and I have to
remain optimistic that it will be.''
   ``I wrote a book quite legitimately that was published quite
legitimately, and it's not really for the person who is the object
of an attack to solve the problem,'' he said.
   But Liquat Hussain, leader of the Moslem community in the
central England city of Bradford where ``The Satanic Verses'' was
first burned, said Rushdie ``is the key to the problem.''
   ``He and his publishers can only solve the problem by
withdrawing the book from publication,'' he said.
   Hussain said the Moslem campaign against the book would continue
until it was withdrawn and the British law on blasphemy applied to
all citizens. The law now applies only to Christian religions.
   Rushdie agreed to the interview on behalf of the Charter 88
campaign for a written constitution in Britain, which is the only
country in Western Europe without one.
   Rushdie said newspaper reports that he was sighted in various
places and had to be hustled away from a dinner in Oxford after
Moslems arrived, were wrong.
   ``I've been sighted all over the place. I'm told I've been in
Switzerland; there was a point where I was supposed to be in
Paris,'' Rushdie said. ``The fact is that I'm in none of those
places.''
   The BBC said Rushdie placed the call and they did not know from
where he called.

   Three men accosted Iran's foreign minister
in a U.N. hallway Friday shouting ``Murderer!'' and ``Torturer!''
and one hurled eggs at Velayati before being wrestled to the floor.
   The eggs missed and the minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, was
untouched and unharmed. The three well-dressed men, who identified
themselves as Iranians, were apprehended and held for questioning.
   One man, giving his name as Ahmed Mohini, said the Iranian
government killed his brother.
   ``Velayati does not represent the Iranian people and should not
be allowed here,'' he said, before being hustled off by guards.
   Velayati proceeded to his scheduled news conference, where he
told reporters he didn't know the men.
   It was not known how the men got through U.N. security. U.S.
State Department security guards also were protecting Velayati.
   The ambassador told the conference in response to a question
that Iran's 14-month-old death sentence against British author
Salman Rushdie still stands and has been supported by the Islamic
world.
   The sentence was decreed by the late Iranian leader Ayatolla
Ruhollah Khomeini, who found Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic
Verses,'' blasphemous.
   Velayati also repeated statements calling for international
efforts to free all ``hostages,'' Western and Middle Eastern, held
in Lebanon and Israel.
   ``It helps this positive process if the United States and
Britain use their moral influence over the government of Israel and
also the Phalangist groups (in Lebanon) to get the release of
Iranian hostages ... and also some Moslems in Lebanon and
Palestine.''
   He was referring to Iranians who disappeared in Lebanon in the
early 1980s and to prisoners held by Israel and its South Lebanese
Army militia allies.
   Velayati said Iran-Iraq peace talks were stalemated and he
blamed Iraq.
   The two Persian Gulf neighbors fought an eight-year war which
was halted by a truce in 1988.

   President Bush on Friday removed Japan from a
``hit list'' of countries judged to have erected the most offensive
trade barriers against American products, rewarding Japanese
efforts to ease trade tensions between the two economic superpowers.
   Instead, the president said he had decided to cite only one
country _ India _ under a tough section of U.S. trade law which
provides for economic retaliation if the offending barriers are not
removed.
   The decision brought immediate protests from members of
Congress, who charged the administration had made a serious mistake
in not naming Japan, the country Congress specifically had in mind
when it wrote the provision, known as Super 301, into the 1988
Trade Act.
   ``I am thunderstruck,'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said in a
Senate floor speech. ``Excuse me, Mr. President, but this boggles
the mind. ... Letting Japan off the hook is a serious mistake and I
think Congress ought to take a look at it.''
   Critics said Japan needed to be targeted to keep pressure on the
government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu to live up to a flurry
of trade concessions he has made aimed at lowering America's huge
$49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   ``It is clear that Japan should be on the list,'' said Sen. Don
Riegle, D-Mich., one of the sponsors of the Super 301 provision.
``Our government is not using the tools that are available to
correct this continuing hemorrhage of U.S. capital and jobs.''
   But Bush, in announcing his decision, said he was persuaded that
Kaifu shared ``my commitment to ensuring that trade strengthens,
rather than undermines, the friendship between our nations.''
   Administration officials said targeting Japan could provoke a
public backlash against the United States and make Kaifu's job of
reforming Japan's trading system even more difficult.
   ``We believe that the most effective way to achieve results is
through cooperation, not confrontation,'' U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills told reporters.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama praised the president's
decision, saying it upheld his government's position that it would
not negotiate with the United States under threat of retaliation.
   But House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt called the decision a
``free trade furlough.''
   ``If we have learned anything over the years as we have fought
to reduce our monumental trade deficit with Japan, it is that the
only thing that works is clear, constant, consistent pressure for
needed change,'' Gephardt said.
   A year ago, the administration used the Super 301 provision to
target Japan, Brazil and India as the countries with the highest
barriers to American trade.
   Japan was cited for barriers to sales of U.S.-made
supercomputers, satellites and wood products. In the past month,
U.S. and Japanese negotiators have reached market-opening
agreements in all three areas.
   Brazil was targeted for restrictive import licensing practices.
Hills said recently enacted legislation in that country should meet
U.S. concerns in this area.
   But India, which was cited last year for a ban on operations of
foreign private insurance companies and for controls on foreign
investment that distort trade, has refused to make concessions.
   The 1990 target list names those barriers again. Hills said
India was singled out because it had erected more trade barriers
than any non-communist country and the negotiations over the past
year had made no progress.
   The Indian government issued a statement saying it would
continue to refuse to ``negotiate bilaterally under threat of
sanctions.'' It said the best way to resolve the dispute was in the
current round of global trade talks being held under the auspices
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Members of Congress said it made no sense to target India, with
its modest $850 million trade surplus with the United States, and
neglect Japan, whose trade surplus accounted for almost half of
America's $109 billion deficit last year.
   ``Naming India and not Japan makes a mockery of Super 301 and
U.S. trade policy,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said he was glad
the administration had at least issued a new Super 301 list
although he was disappointed that Japan was not included.
   Bentsen, D-Texas, had warned earlier in the week that if the
administration ignored the law completely this year he would work
to block congressional passage of trade agreements the
administration is expected to seek this year with the Soviet Union,
China and the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
   The 1988 trade law required the administration to issue a target
list of countries with the most offensive trade barriers in 1989
and 1990. The law provides a tight timetable for negotiating away
barriers and provides for retaliatory tariffs against the nation's
imports into the United States if the negotiations prove
unsuccessful.
   Some in Congress said they would propose legislation to make the
Super 301 designation an annual event, thus forcing the
administration to address again next year Japan's success in
opening its markets.

<HEAD>Chad Says Hundreds of Rebels Die in Fighting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chad said Friday that its troops killed more than
700 Libyan-backed rebels in recent fighting, and that France
promised to keep a reinforced military contingent in its former
colony.
   The Libyans ``continue to want to impose their will on Chad''
despite a peace agreement the two countries signed Aug. 31, said
Foreign Minister Asheik Ibn Oumar.
   ``We have had the assurance that ... French backing will not be
lacking when we need it,'' he said.
   The Chadian government of President Hissene Habre accuses
Tripoli of arming and training the Islamic Legion rebels fighting
in eastern Chad, but Libya denies the Legion exists.
   The two North African countries, which border each other, have a
long-running dispute over a territory in northern Chad called the
Aouzou Strip.
   Casualty figures released by the Chadian Embassy in Paris listed
736 rebels killed and 328 captured in attacks April 18 and 20 on
two columns of the Islamic Legion.
   Chad's High Command gave government losses for the first time:
47 soldiers killed, 102 wounded and about 150 vehicles and 63 heavy
arms captured.
   The Legion operates along Chad's eastern border from bases
inside neighboring Sudan's lightly populated Darfur province, where
the Khartoum government exercises virtually no control.
   Renewed fighting in the sporadic civil war broke out last month
when rebels took government outposts at Bahai and Tine. Chadian
troops later recaptured the positions.
   
   Ibn Oumar said France assured him 1,200 French troops will
remain in Chad indefinitely but added that no active support of the
soldiers would be needed.
   ``What we need is materials and weapons, not the men to use
them,'' he said.
   Libya, which once occupied most of northern Chad, was chased out
three years ago in a series of defeats. It still claims the Aouzou
Strip as its own.
   In the August agreement signed in Algiers, Libya and Chad
reconfirmed a cease-fire, agreed to the exchange of prisoners of
war and to submitting their territorial dispute to international
arbitration.
   But Ibn Oumar said Chad has encountered ``only endless
obstruction'' from the Libyans in trying to implement the agreement.
   Every meeting of experts on the territorial dispute ended in
failure. Ibn Oumar said Libya wanted to discuss freeing an
estimated 2,000 Libyans held by Chad, while Chad wanted to discuss
the future of the Aouzou Strip.
   He said unless there is a breakthrough, Chad is plans ``to place
the problem before the International Court at the Hague as from
Sept. 1, as entitled by the Algiers agreement.''
   Ibn Oumar also complained that European countries have an
increasing tendency to neglect Africa because their attention is
focused on events in Eastern Europe.
   ``We have repaid our total debt three or four times, yet today
we are more indebted than ever,'' he said. ``The European countries
refuse even to discuss our urgent needs, although the
responsibility is theirs for colonizing us and for looting our
economies during and since the colonial era.''
   Chad gained independence from France in 1960.

<HEAD>Exxon Unveils 1990 Alaska Cleanup Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. on Friday unveiled its
second _ and last _ cleanup plan for the Exxon Valdez oil spill,
saying it will spread fertilizers that promote oil-eating bacteria
and send squads to pick up debris. ``This year's work is scattered,
so we want to use a very flexible, squad-type group that can move
in and move out and move over to do other work,'' said Don
Carpenter, Exxon's logistics and operations manager.
   The plan, submitted to Coast Guard Rear Admiral David E.
Ciancaglini for approval, contradicts conclusions by state
officials that more than three quarters of beaches surveyed were
still oiled from last year's spill.
   The plan's call for bioremediation _ the use of the fertilizers
_ also has been controversial. State environmental officials said
earlier in the week they won't approve its use until further
studies have been done to allay fears about possible toxicity.
   Exxon plans to return its crews to the beaches May 1.
   A multi-agency task force has been conducting a shoreline survey
this month and determined that conditions in Prince William Sound
and the Gulf of Alaska have improved dramatically over the winter,
Exxon said.
   The oil company said its studies of 574 miles of shoreline so
far showed two-thirds without any oil at all, 22 percent with
``very light oiling'' and 13 percent with ``a narrow to wide band
of weathered crude along sections.''
   Those figures include subsurface oil as well, they said, which
went below 4 inches on 16 miles of shoreline.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation reported
those survey results differently Wednesday, saying 79 percent of
the shoreline sites surveyed were still oiled.
   ``I don't understand their numbers _ what the statistics are
based on,'' Exxon's technical manager, Bob Mastracchio, said
Friday. ``We've got 20 teams out there surveying shorelines.''
   A more serious clash, however, may develop over bioremediation.
   Of 209 sites Exxon has targeted so far for cleanup, it hopes to
use bioremediation on 160 of them.
   Some state and federal policymakers are worried about the
release of still more toxins. If they don't allow the fertilizers,
``that's gonna be a dilemma for the agencies and the plan,''
Mastracchio said.
   ``If you can't use bioremediation, you can let nature remove the
oil over the next few seasons. Bioremediation simply speeds up a
natural degradation process.''
   The company will meet with federal parks officials and state
environmental officials to continue talking about the use of the
fertilizers, he said.
   Exxon said it plans to manually pick up oily debris and tarballs
on the majority of sites targeted for cleanup, spotwash certain
areas and till and rake sediment in others. Mastracchio said manual
pickup was the least environmentally destructive kind of cleanup,
comparing rock-washing an entire beach to ``strip-mining'' it.
   The size of Exxon's crews this summer will be about 10 percent
of last summer's. The company expects to have 1,100 people at work
on the cleanup by June 1.
   Exxon's plans call for eight mobile teams supported by eight
berthing vessels and 12 landing craft. The teams would be supported
by 24 helicopters, 10 other aircraft, 20 work boats, eight supply
vessels and about 30 smaller boats and skiffs.
   That compares with more than 10,000 workers and 1,000 boats
leased for last summer's $2 billion program.
   Exxon officials wouldn't estimate how much this summer's cleanup
will cost, but they expect it will be their last.
   ``We're putting out more than enough resources so the work can
be done by the end of this summer,'' said Carpenter.
   Hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline were fouled when the
tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef March 24, 1989,
releasing nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil into
the water.
   It was the nation's biggest oil spill, coating hundreds of miles
of shoreline and killing hundreds of otters and thousands of birds
and other animals.
   Ciancaglini, the federal on-site coordinator, said it will take
him several days to review Exxon's plan and the comments on it
submitted by various state and federal agencies, and other parties.
The review won't delay the start of cleanup, he said.

<TEXT>
   A wildlife advocacy group said Friday
it has begun a campaign to warn fishermen on Indonesia's Padaido
Islands that damage caused by their catching fish with explosives
will ruin the fishing grounds.
   The warning came in an article published by the feature service
of the World Wide Fund for Nature, or WWF, known as World Wildlife
Fund in the United States, Canada and Australia.
   It informed the fishermen that the explosives they fashion from
recovered World War II bombs are ruining fragile coral reefs and
devastating marine life. ``What will we live on tomorrow?'' ask a
WWF poster in the local language. ``Where will we fish? Don't ruin
your future''
   WWF, said that at the end of the war the U.S. 7th Fleet, which
operated out of the Padaido Islands, dumped thousands of live bombs
in the center of the chain's atoll.
   Villagers dredged up the bombs, emptied their contents ``and
developed a local fish bomb industry'' that proved destructive to
the environment, the WWF said. The contents of a large bomb can
fill hundreds of small fishing bombs.
   The concussion from the bombs kills the fish and they float to
the surface for fishermen to collect.
   It takes 38 years for a bombed reef to grow back to half its
original area, Don McAllister, a specialist with the
Switzerland-based World Conservation Union, was quoted as saying.
   WWF said fish catches fall dramatically when reefs are damaged,
but the bombing problem has been largely ignored because damaged
reefs are hidden beneath the sea.

   A day after a Colombian presidential
candidate was slain in a hail of bullets aboard an Avianca Airlines
flight, passengers were up in arms Friday at the prospect of flying
with a politician and her 25 bodyguards.
   About 100 ticketed passengers refused to board a domestic
Avianca flight in the coastal city of Barranquilla when they
learned that a leftist congresswoman and her heavily armed security
contingent would be traveling with them, radio reports said.
   It was on a flight to Barranquilla from Bogota Thursday that a
submachine gun-toting assassin fatally wounded Carlos Pizarro, a
former guerrilla and presidential candidate. Pizarro's dozen
bodyguards quickly killed the assailant, and the plane landed
safely.
   The radio chains Caracol and RCN said in Friday's incident, the
plane stayed at the ramp at the Barranquilla airport for 2{ hours
until about 50 of the ticketed passengers finally decided to board,
and the plane departed.
   The congresswoman, Vera Grave, is a longtime member of the April
19 Movement guerrilla group, known as the M-19, which Pizarro
commanded. She was elected to Congress after the guerrilla group
disbanded six weeks ago.
   Meanwhile, the pilot of the plane on which Pizarro was
assassinated suggested that new guidelines might be needed to
prevent airliners from becoming the scene of gunbattles between

<HEAD>Ulster Bobby-Trap Kills Northern Ireland Builder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A booby-trap bomb blew up a car
near the Irish border Friday and killed a builder whose company had
been threatened by the Irish Republican Army over its work for the
security forces.
   In London, the Court of Appeal overturned the 1988 convictions
of three Irish people accused of conspiring to kill Tom King, then
Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, on grounds that comments King
made may have prejudiced the trial.
   Martina Shanahan, 24, John McCann, 26, and Finbar Cullen, 29,
were freed, but then were immediately rearrested under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act and ordered returned to Ireland.
   Friday's bombing in the fishing village of Kilkeel came a day
after police said they received intelligence reports that the IRA
planned to step up its terror campaign, and police called on the
public to be ``extremely vigilant.''
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the explosion at a road
junction five miles from the border with Ireland mortally wounded
the driver. He died soon after in a hospital.
   Neighbors identified the victim as Ken Graham in his mid-30s.
   The IRA had warned Graham's firm to stop construction work at
police and military installations in the province, according to
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   As part of its campaign to drive the British out of Northern
Ireland, the IRA has killed 13 people involved in such construction
work since August 1985.
   The IRA wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland
with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   In nearby Newry, police reported confiscating more than 1,000
pounds of explosives and a rifle in a vacant house in a Catholic
neighborhood.
   The three Irish people whose convictions were overturned had
been found guilty of conspiring to kill King after his daughter saw
them in the grounds of their home in Northern Ireland and notified
security men.
   The court ruled that King, now defense secretary in Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Cabinet, could have prejudiced the
outcome of the trial by appearing on television and arguing that
terrorist suspects should not have the right to remain silent.

   The new pro-democracy government said
Friday it has dismantled the last remnants of King Birendra's
29-year-old political system, which had given the monarch an
absolute grip on power.
   C.K. Prasai, a spokesman for the Nepali Congress Party, said the
Cabinet had moved late Thursday night to dissolve the system of
``panchayat.'' The term means ``grassroots government,'' but it
actually gave the palace the power to choose local and national
government representatives.
   The new government took office April 19. Birendra legalized
political parties April 8, two days after security forces opened
fire on pro-democracy deomstrators, killing scores of people.
   Witnesses said 200 people were killed, but Birendra's government
said 10 were killed and 107 were injured.
   Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai announced the Cabinet
decision during a Nepali Congress executive committee meeting
Friday, Prasai told reporters.
   ``From now on there is no panchayat from village level to
national level in the country,'' Prasai said. ``This is a very
drastic and swift step towards fulfilling the aspirations of the
people. It is happy news.''
   The panchayat system was introuduced by Birendra's father, King
Mahendra, in 1961, and extended from local levels to the Rashtriya
Panchayat, or National Assembly.
   Birendra dissolved the Rashtriya Panchayat on April 16,
succumbing to demands of the pro-democracy movement spearheaded by
the Nepali Congress and the seven-party United Left Front.
   His order did not formally disband local branches of the system,
although they had become practically defunct.
   Prasai said the district panchayats will be run by local
development officers and that village secretaries will handle
administrative duties until a new system is announced.
   The Nepali Congress headed the country's only democratically
elected government in 1959, but it lasted only 20 months before it
was dismissed by Mahendra as part of his plan to set up the
panchayat system.

<HEAD>Governor Says South Dakota Plans To Sue Corps Of Engineers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET BROKAW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PIERRE, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Mickelson said Friday South
Dakota will file a lawsuit seeking to force the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to reduce water releases from drought-stricken reservoirs
on the upper Missouri River.
   Despite a three-year drought, the Corps of Engineers has
continued to discharge large amounts of water to support a small
amount of barge traffic from Sioux City, Iowa, to St. Louis, Mo.,
Mickelson said at a news conference.
   The governor said he's still willing to settle the dispute
through negotiation, but it's unlikely such an agreement can be
reached before the lawsuit is filed sometime next week.
   ``I'm tired of the inaction and the indifference we have seen
from all of our efforts,'' Mickelson said.
   He said governors of other Missouri River states and leaders of
Indian tribal governments may join South Dakota in the lawsuit.
Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota said Friday his state is likely
to take part.
   The state has hired former Gov. Bill Janklow, a lawyer, to
handle the lawsuit.
   Dropping water levels have threatened city and rural water
supply systems, left boat ramps far from the water's edge and
prevented irrigators from using the water in the huge reservoirs,
Mickelson said.
   ``The citizens of South Dakota deserve and have the right to
expect that we will equitably share in the benefits of the Missouri
River reservoirs, and to this point we have not,'' he told
reporters.
   G. Edward Dickey, acting deputy secretary of the Army for civil
works, said the agency doesn't comment on lawsuits or potential
lawsuits.
   But Dickey said groups that use rivers and reservoirs get
worried when a drought cuts the water supply. The corps is
following the policy in its master manual in operating the Missouri
River reservoirs, he said.
   ``We have a drought out there, a very severe drought. ... It's
not surprising we have a lot of anxieties,'' Dickey said in a
telephone interview from his Washington office. ``Until it rains,
there's going to be continuing unhappiness among all users because
everybody gives up something.''
   The water levels in Fort Peck Lake in Montana, Lake Sakakawea in
North Dakota and Oahe Reservoir in South Dakota have suffered the
greatest drops in water levels during the drought. The other three,
smaller reservoirs in South Dakota have not been affected as much.
   The water level in Oahe Reservoir, which stretches 230 miles
from the middle of South Dakota to southern North Dakota, has
fallen 20 feet below normal at times during the past year.
   Mickelson said the Corps of Engineers' own study estimates
downstream barge traffic is worth only $12 million a year, while
recreation in the upstream states is worth more than $63 million
annually, he said.
   ``What we're seeing now is massive, record releases that are
going out of the reservoirs in our state to support a dying
navigation industry between St. Louis and Sioux City,'' Mickelson
said.
   Sinner, the North Dakota governor, said the Corps of Engineers
relies on the downstream navigation channel more than private
shippers do.
   He said the lawsuit might seek a court order reducing reservoir
releases to the point where downstream navigation is shut down.
   Mickelson said the lawsuit will seek a court order requiring the
corps to determine new long-term priorities for water use in the
Missouri River. The lawsuit would harm only the navigation industry
in downstream states, Mickelson said.

<TEXT>
   Five long-exiled leaders of the
African National Congress made an emotional return to South Africa
on Friday to prepare for groundbreaking talks next week with the
white-led government.
   The five, who arrived from the group's exile headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia, will join ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela for
discussions with President F.W. de Klerk's government May 2-4.
   ``As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 27 years
ago, `We are really on the way,''' said Joe Slovo, a member of the
ANC's National Executive Committee. He fled South Africa in 1963.
   ``We who left by the back door ... have now entered the very
front door of South Africa,'' said Slovo, the ANC's highest-ranking
white. ``It's a remarkable feeling.''
   In addition to Slovo, the group included the ANC's
secretary-general, Alfred Nzo; head of foreign affairs, Thabo
Mbeki; commander of the movement's guerrilla wing, Joe Modise; and
head of the women's section, Ruth Mompati.
   The five, who had been in exile since the 1960s, arrived on a
private charter and held an airport news conference.
   ``It is an exciting moment for all of us,'' said Nzo.
``Regrettably, our South Africa is still a bleeding country ravaged
by the apartheid system which continues to divide our people into
warring clusters.''
   Mbeki wept as he stood beside his 80-year-old father, Govan
Mbeki, an ANC veteran who spent 23 years in prison before his
release in 1987.
   About 100 supporters greeted the ANC leaders at the airport.
Hundreds more lined the road outside, waving the banners of the ANC
and its ally, the South African Communist Party.
   Meanwhile, exiled ANC President Oliver Tambo, 73, quietly left
Sweden on Thursday after a recuperating there since Jan. 3 from a
stroke he suffered late last year, officials in Stockholm said
Friday.
   The Swedish news agency TT said Tambo wanted to return to South
Africa soon, but it was unlikely he would be able to resume an
active leadership role in the ANC.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC in February after a 30-year ban. Many
of the estimated 15,000 members in exile are likely to return this
year. Four lesser-ranking ANC officials returned this week but have
not appeared in public.
   The government promised that the exiled ANC leaders would not be
prosecuted upon returning to South Africa for the talks.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
country's 5 million whites maintain political and economic control,
and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
   Next week's talks are designed to clear the way for negotiations
on a new constitution that would include blacks.
   The ANC has said the government must lift the 3{-year-old state
of emergency and release prisoners convicted of politically
motivated crimes before negotiations can begin. The government
wants the ANC to renounce its armed struggle.
   The government has said constitutional negotiations will include
several black opposition groups in addition to the ANC.
   Slovo is general secretary of the Communist Party. About half of
the ANC's top 35 leaders also are Communists.
   In other developments:
   _Police said Friday six people were killed in black factional
fighting in Natal Province during the preceding 24 hours.
   _Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said he plans to introduce
legislation that would end racial segregation of prisons.
   _A former member of the Johannesburg City Council security
department alleged that a military intelligence operative was
responsible for the assassination last year of prominent white
anti-apartheid activist David Webster.
   Hannes Gouws made his allegation at an inquiry into a spy ring
conducted by the city council. No one has been arrested for
Webster's killing.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Mandates Statewide Recycling, Tax to Pay for It</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson on Friday signed
what he called the nation's strictest recycling law, which bans
bottles, newspapers and other recyclable waste from Wisconsin dumps
by 1995.
   The law requires every community to draw up a mandatory
recycling plan by that year. And it imposes a $15 million-a-year
tax on big businesses to help pay for stemming the tide of trash.
   Sponsors of the measure, along with some environmentalists, also
called it the most far-reaching in any state because of its one-two
punch of mandatory statewide recycling and a tax on business.
   ``As far as I know, Wisconsin is the first state to use a
broad-based business tax to pay for recycling,'' said Jeanne Wirka,
policy analyst for the Washington-based Environmental Action
Foundation. The advocacy group has 30,000 members nationwide.
   The Wisconsin bill is similar to a measure pending in the
Vermont legislature, and is likely to serve as a model for other
states, she said.
   Thompson, a Republican, surprised some by retaining part of the
business tax, which he had been expected to excise from the bill
using his power of partial veto.
   ``Overall, it's a very tough bill and it's making a lot of
people nervous,'' said Douglas Johnson, a lobbyist for an industry
group called the Wisconsin Consumer Packaging Council.
   Nothing will change immediately because of the bill, which will
work largely by banning recyclable products from the state's
landfills.
   Communities, many of which have already begun work on plans that
require residents and businesses to recycle, must have mandatory
recycling in place by 1995. That is also when the dumping
restrictions take effect.
   A detailed list of products barred from dumps includes aluminum,
glass and plastic containers, newspapers, cardboard and office
paper, steel containers and old tires.
   Wisconsin dumps will have to stop taking refuse from
out-of-state _ except from communities with the same strict
recycling rules. Private Wisconsin dumps now accept large amounts
of refuse from Minnesota and elsewhere.
   The state will put up $18.5 million a year to finance the
effort. Added to that will be an estimated $15 million from a tax
on larger businesses.
   The tax would be graduated: Firms with annual receipts of $1
million would pay $63 a year, and that would rise to rise to $2,170
for firms with $6 million or more in gross receipts. Companies with
gross annual receipts of less than $1 million would be spared the
tax.
   Businesses would begin paying the tax in 1992, to accumulate
money for the recycling program. The tax method would be reassessed
after two years.
   ``This is the most progressive, far-reaching and potentially
effective recycling law in the United States,'' Thompson said
during the Capitol bill signing-ceremony.
   Wisconsin previously enacted legislation banning grass clippings
and other yard wastes from landfills beginning in 1993.
   The original bill called for about $30 million in business
taxes. But Thompson used his partial veto power to cut the gross
receipts tax in half, and to set an expiration date of two years to
force the Legislature to seek others forms of funding.
   The governor also removed sections that would have banned some
types of packaging. He said that ``represented a potential threat
to Wisconsin jobs with little or no demonstrated environmental
gain.''
   The Legislature approved the measure in late March, after
removing some strict features. Among them was a proposed penny-per
diaper tax on disposables to pay for recycling.

<HEAD>Japanese Astonomers Make Detailed Pictures of Comet Austin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese astronomers reported Friday that they have
produced detailed pictures of Comet Austin, which is observable
through telescopes in the northern hemisphere as it nears the Earth.
   An observatory official said researchers took the photographs
Wednesday night through a telescope at Tokyo University's
observatory in northern Japan. He said details of the comet's
4.4-million-mile-long tail showed up clearly in the pictures,
affording researchers the opportunity of studying it.
   The tail of a comet is essentially a vapor trail created by
solar wind striking the comet's icy surface.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
photos are the first of Comet Austin taken by Japanese researchers
for astronomical observation.
   The comet is advancing about 3.8 million miles a day, he said.
Unlike periodic comets such as Halley's, he said, Comet Austin,
having circled the sun, will never return.
   Comet Austin was named for amateur astronomer Rodney Austin of
New Zealand, who discovered it last year.
   It will be observable throughout much of the Earth's northern
hemisphere until the end of May, but it is not bright enough to be
seen by the naked eye, the official said. It is traveling in a
westerly direction, he added.
   The official reported that the observation effort is being
conducted at 30 locations throughout Japan and that photos and
other data on Comet Austin will be shared with the Smithsonian
Observatory in the United States.

<TEXT>
   A jury Friday convicted a former Houston policeman
of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting of a black woman on a
Houston freeway after a Halloween night of drinking among off-duty
officers.
   Alex Gonzales, who was himself critically wounded by the victim
in what prosecutors said was self-defense, faces up to 20 years in
jail for the conviction in the death of Ida Lee Delaney on Oct. 31.
   The all-white jury, which began deliberating late Wednesday
afternoon, delivered its verdict shortly before 2:30 p.m. Friday.
   State District Judge Ted Poe instructed jurors that they could
find Gonzales guilty of murder, voluntary manslaughter or innocent
of either charge.
   The punishment phase of the trial is scheduled to begin Monday.
   The trial was moved to Dallas because of heavy pretrial
publicity in Houston, where the death of Ms. Delaney became another
cause for groups that maintain that Houston police are hostile
toward blacks. She was a janitor at The Houston Post.
   Gonzales, 25, was accused of provoking Ms. Delaney, 50, into the
pre-dawn shooting, then killing her. Tests after the incident
showed Gonzales had a blood-alcohol level of .19, nearly twice the
amount to be considered legally drunk in Texas.
   According to trial testimony, Gonzales was riding in a private
car with two other off-duty officers, none wearing uniforms, when
they encountered Ms. Delaney's pickup truck about 5:15 a.m.
   Prosecutors said Gonzales and the other officers, who have also
been dismissed from the department since the incident, chased Ms.
Delaney for 12 miles after she cut them off in traffic on her way
to work.
   ``He stepped out of his police suit to become a thug on the
street,'' said Harris County prosecutor Chuck Rosenthal in closing
arguments on Wednesday.
   Ms. Delaney had no way of knowing that the men chasing her were
police officers, prosecutors said.
   The shooting occurred after Ms. Delaney pulled off the freeway.
   Defense attorneys Wednesday said Gonzales shot Ms. Delaney in
self-defense.
   ``She was a violent, aggressive hair-trigger individual,''
defense attorney Joe Bailey said.
   Fellow defense attorney Mike Hinton told the jury, ``She was
discharging her weapon because she was discharging her temper.''
   Gonzales said he and fellow officers Alexander Romero and R.C.
Gonzales Jr. followed Delaney to arrest her after she nearly hit
their car with her pickup and shot at them.
   Prosecutors say the three harassed and terrified the woman and
that Gonzales, who was drunk and out of uniform, slugged Delaney in
the face before shooting her to death.

   The Hubble Space Telescope orbited
with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame
communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its
electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
   Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of
shuttle Discovery's astronauts, who prepared for Sunday's return to
Earth.
   ``You've been released from Hubble support. It's on its own,''
Mission Control's Story Musgrave told the five crew members.
   ``That's great news,'' replied Discovery commander Loren J.
Shriver.
   ``There are handshakes and smiles all around up here. I'll bet
it's just that way back down there, too,'' added mission specialist
Steven Hawley. ``Who's buying tonight?''
   ``We'll buy when you all get back,'' Musgrave replied.
   Flight director William Reeves said it was too early to cheer.
   `We still have an important part of the mission to go,'' Reeves
said. ``We reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the
ground.''
   Discovery is to land at 9:48 a.m. EDT Sunday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif. Landing would have been delayed a day if
astronauts Bruce McCandless and Kathryn Sullivan had had to perform
a space walk to crank open the telescope's lens cover, or aperture
door.
   The shuttle trailed 50 miles behind Hubble when the aperture
door opened 380 miles above Earth, but passed 3.7 miles beneath the
telescope later in the day.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had planned to
release its first test image from the $1.5 billion telescope on
Tuesday, showing an open star cluster in the constellation Carina.
But Steve Terry, director of orbital verifications, said that would
be delayed by problems with Hubble's high-speed antennas.
Scientific data will follow in a month or two.
   Hubble's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the
heavens at 10:30 a.m. EDT, nearly four hours later than planned,
exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the
first time.
   Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift
even though the telescope was in an automatic ``safe mode,'' with
all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed
dish antennas with a relay satellite.
   One of the two antennas apparently had swung too far, and the
telescope shut down, said Jean Oliver, a Hubble deputy project
manager. If future movements of the antenna have to be limited to
avoid the problem, it would have only slight impact on the
telescope's observing time, Oliver said.
   Terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been
delayed much longer.
   ``There has to be a point where you say they have to go their
way and we have to go ours,'' he said of the astronauts.
   When the door opened, two of Hubble's four position-stabilizing
gyroscopes stopped working; later, engineers got them back on line.
The motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros, said Dave
Drachlis of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. That, too,
kept it in the safe mode.
   Oliver said it would be Saturday morning before the telescope is
brought out of the safe mode. It will take another day to get the
instrument operating normally again, putting controllers at Goddard
several days behind.
   ``We're trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any
corners and do anything fast because we feel there's a lot at risk
here and we want to make sure we're doing it properly,'' Oliver
said. ``We've got a long future ahead of us, and we want to make
sure it starts off on the right foot.''
   NASA said the telescope was safe and in a stable position.
   Tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly
narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many
malfunctions, Terry said. In addition to that trouble, there were
two communications outages totaling several hours.
   ``We're cautious, and that's natural,'' Terry said. ``We've got
a very expensive spacecraft here and we don't want to do anything
to jeopardize the usefulness. ... We'll get to the point where we
know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits
appropriately.''
   Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be ``the
master of its own destiny'' in case contact with an orbiting
communications system is lost for extended periods. The telescope
will share the system, known as Tracking and Data Relay Satellites,
with other space craft.
   Except for a tiny wedge opening, the lens cover had been closed
and the telescope blind ever since Hubble was released by the
astronauts Wednesday.
   From its orbit high above Earth's distorting atmosphere, the
telescope will enable astronomers over its 15-year working lifetime
to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the
universe. The universe is believed to have been created about 15
billion years ago in a cosmic explosion.
   The late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, for whom the telescope is
named, provided the basis for the Big Bang theory of creation. He
discovered during the 1920s that the universe is expanding and that
the farther the galaxy is from Earth, the faster it is moving away.
   In honor of the astronomer, Sullivan carried with her into space
an eyepiece from the 100-inch telescope at California's Mount
Wilson Observatory that Hubble used to make his pioneering
observations.
   ``It's a great pleasure to have something of such historical
significance and something that so directly symbolizes Edwin
Hubble's fundamental contributions to astronomy,'' she said Friday
afternoon.
   Once back on Earth, the eyepiece will be displayed at the
observatory.

<HEAD>Girl Loses Arms, Legs From Rare Toxic Shock Bacteria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old girl's arms and legs were
amputated after a rare form of toxic shock bacteria infected
chicken pox lesions on her body, doctors said.
   ``This is exceedingly rare,'' said Dr. John Bradley, director of
the division of infectious disease at Children's Hospital.
   He said he knew of no documented case of this strain of bacteria
infecting children, although there have been dozens of cases
involving adults and it is fatal about 30 percent of the time.
   Jessica Lynn Esquivel was admitted to the hospital April 1 with
what was believed to be a routine case of chicken pox. But a
toxin-producing streptococcal bacteria infected the lesions on her
body caused by the chicken pox and spread to the other parts of her
body.
   The onset of toxic shock caused what Bradley termed ``full
cardiac arrest,'' in addition to kidney, liver and respiratory
failure, before infusions of penicillin began to reduce the effects
of the bacteria.
   Because the illness had obstructed circulation to her limbs,
doctors severed Jessica's legs at the knee and her arms at the
elbow on April 18, Bradley said Wednesday.
   Jessica had been in critical condition after the surgery, but
was upgraded to serious this morning, said hospital spokeswoman
Sharon Ross.
   ``With what we know about this toxin-producing strain of strep,
the shock that we saw here at the hospital was an extremely
difficult one to reverse,'' Bradley said.
   He said he doubted that Jessica's condition could have been
prevented because there is no vaccine for chicken pox and because
of the rarity of the bacteria.
   He said the child would not have incurred the bacteria without
first having had the chicken pox, but that streptococcus infections
as an adjunct to chicken pox are common.
   Dr. Brad Peterson, who treated Jessica, said the girl suffered
damage to her vital organs but they are ```100 percent'' better now.
   Jessica, who had been in an artificial respirator until this
week, is now able to speak. Peterson said the loss of her arms and
legs have been explained to her and that a psychiatrist has been
made available.
   Ms. Ross said a trust fund has been established to help pay for
the child's long-term recovery.
   Lisa Esquivel, 25, said she and her husband, Felix, 27, the
girl's parents, are devastated by the turn of events.
   ``Now my daughter doesn't have hands or feet ... and it's
hard,'' said Felix Esquivel.

<HEAD>Chemists' Laboratory-Created Molecule Makes, Stores Energy</HEAD>

   A synthetic molecule that converts light
into energy almost as efficiently as the natural process of
photosynthesis could be used to enrich soil and genetically design
herbicide-resistant crops, scientists say.
   The device, which stores energy the way a battery would, may
even help speed up computers _ if someone can figure out how to
hook up the microscopic device to wires many times its size.
   Thomas Moore, one of the 12-member team from Arizona State
University's Photosynthesis Research Center who worked on the
molecule, said it might be able to drive chemical reactions in the
soil such as nitrogen fixation, known more commonly as
fertilization.
   Crops grown in such soil would be healthier and more robust.
   The researchers published the details of their work in the April
13 issue of the journal Science.
   Devens Gust, a leader of the research group, said the device is
called a ``pentad molecule'' because of its five active parts,
which are based on natural materials. A previous device they built
in 1983 consisted of three parts but was only 5 percent as
efficient as the new one, which is capable of storing 83 percent as
much energy as natural molecules do in photosynthesis.
   Gust said the device does that by separating the positive and
negatively charged parts of atoms and holding them about
one-billionth of a centimeter apart at opposite ends of the
ladder-like molecule.
   Photosynthesis is the solar-powered process by which plants
convert nutrients and water to food.
   Dr. Mark Wrighton, chairman of the chemistry department at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a telephone
interview that efficient molecular electronic components also could
radically increase the speed and capability of computers.
   Gust, however, said one roadblock to employing the ASU molecule
in consumer electronics is its size in relation to wires leading to
circuits.
   ``The traditional approach to electronics really has been a
materials approach,'' Gust said. ``You start out with something
such as bulk silicon. Then you devise ways to make devices from
that bulk silicon that are smaller and smaller.''
   Using the molecular-electronics approach, he said, ``You design
the device at the molecular level. Then you try to figure out ways
to incorporate these molecular-sized devices into large,
macroscopic electronic circuits.''
   Such applications may be years away, Gust said. But he said the
device would be easy to apply in agriculture almost immediately.
   Besides its use in fertilizing soil, Gust said, the molecule
could be used to genetically design plants resistant to herbicides,
many of which are designed to interrupt photosynthesis.
   Then farmers could spray their fields with a herbicide that
would not affect the desired plants.

<TEXT>
   A dozen rockets slammed into the
Afghan capital and killed five people Friday, the 12th anniversary
of the bloody coup that began Communist rule in Afghanistan, Radio
Kabul reported.
   In Pakistan, relief officials said fundamentalist Moslem clerics
railing against Western influence led about 5,000 people on a
rampage against a private aid group's facilities at a camp for
Afghan refugees.
   No one was hurt in Thursday night's attack at Nasir Bagh, a
sprawling compound near Peshawar that has been home to about 60,000
refugees during the decade-long war in Afghanistan, the officials
said.
   But Shelter Now International, which is financed by several
Christian organizations and delivers relief supplies to refugee
children and widows, said it sustained almost $1 million in damage.
   ``We've been here seven years,'' said Thor Armstrong, director
of Shelter Now. ``It's incomprehensible that this would happen.''
   Armstrong says the trouble apparently was caused by
fundamentalists angry over what they consider corrupting Western
influence on Afghan women.
   Radio Kabul said Friday's fatal rocket attack was the second in
as many days on the Afghan capital.
   The state-run broadcast blamed the latest attack on ``extremist
opposition members backed by Pakistan,'' presumably referring to
U.S.-supported anti-Communist rebels.
   No group claimed responsiblity. Rebel fighters routinely deny
hitting civilian targets.
   Radio Kabul said eight people were wounded and five killed in
the raid. It said two people died and 11 people were hurt Thursday
when five rockets blasted the capital.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in rocket attacks on the
Afghan capital in the past several years.
   The worst attack in recent weeks occurred Monday when a rocket
hit a mosque and killed 13 people. Another six people died that day
when rockets slammed into other parts of the city.
   Moslem insurgents, bankrolled by the United States, Pakistan,
Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, have been fighting 12 years to
topple Kabul's ruling Communists.
   Friday's attack coincided with the 12th anniversary of a bloody
coup that put the Communists in power in Afghanistan.
   On April 27, 1978, Communist leader Nur Mohammad Taraki
overthrew Mohammad Daoud in what was called the Saur Revolution,
named after the Moslem month in which it occurred.
   Within two years of the 1978 coup, more than 100,000 Soviet
soldiers marched into the Central Asian country to replace one
Communist government with another and to crush a burgeoning Moslem
insurgency.
   After nine years of direct involvement, Moscow withdrew its
troops from Afghanistan in 1989.
   Rebel fighters, headquartered in Pakista, have vowed to continue
their fight until Afghanistan's President Najib and his ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan is overthrown.
   The radio broadcast condemned the rebel fighters for the attack,
particularly during Eid-il Fitr, one of Islam's holiest holidays.
   Traditionally the Saur Revolution anniversary has been marked by
pomp and ceremony, military parades and speeches lauding
Communism's contributions to Afghanistan.
   But since the Soviet withdrawal, Najib has toned down the
anniversary.
   The only reference to the Saur Revolution on Radio Kabul's
broadcasts Friday was a message of congratulations from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Since withdrawing its troops, Moscow has sent billions of
dollars worth of military and humanitarian assistance to Kabul.
   Last year, Najib delayed the Saur Revolution celebrations one
day after his government's secret police reportedly uncovered a
plot to assassinate him.
   The state-run radio broadcast did not say whether celebrations
had been canceled Friday or whether they had been delayed.

<HEAD>Atlanta Mayor Pleads for Handgun Laws in Surrounding Counties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days after a mental patient took his new
gun to a suburban mall and shot five people, Mayor Maynard Jackson
pleaded Friday with outlying counties to adopt a handgun waiting
period similar to Atlanta's.
   ``No one is trying to prohibit the use of handguns,'' Jackson
said at a hastily called crime summit at City Hall. ``What we're
talking about is a sane and civilized system _ where someone who's
insane and crazy cannot get a gun and blow somebody's brains out.''
   Atlanta and surrounding Fulton County currently require a 15-day
wait for the purchase of a handgun, to allow public safety
officials time to investigate the buyer's background.
   But virtually anyone can visit towns in surrounding counties to
buy a gun with no delay, since Georgia's local and state
governments have traditionally been hostile to any kind of gun
control.
   About three dozen elected officials and police leaders from the
metro area attended Jackson's meeting. None spoke up to oppose the
waiting-period proposal.
   ``We've got to do something,'' said Mayor T.O. Smith of College
Park, near Atlanta's southside airport. ``It's got to be at the
state level, but we can set an example.''
   After the meeting, Commissioner Nate Mosby of DeKalb County,
where the shootings occurred, said he would draft waiting-period
legislation.
   ``I think the majority of the commission would be amenable to
some kind of deterrent, and the waiting period is the most
palatable,'' he said.
   ``My plea is a consistent waiting period in the eight counties
of metro Atlanta _ that's all I'm asking,'' Jackson said. ``When
somebody's got a record as a homicidal maniac, it gives us a chance
to check.''
   James Calvin Brady, identified as the gunman who killed one and
injured four Tuesday at Perimeter Mall, had been released a day
earlier from a state mental hospital, even though a medical form he
was still carrying listed him as ``homicidal.'' After being
released, he bought the gun in suburban Avondale Estates.
   Atlanta police officials attending the summit said handgun
applications in Atlanta fell from 846 in 1985 to 197 in 1989,
presumably because purchasers bought guns elsewhere.
   Those attending the summit included representatives of DeKalb,
Clayton and Fulton counties and the cities of Atlanta, Hapeville,
Alpharetta, Doraville, McDonough, Roswell, Smyrna, East Point,
Mountain Park, Fairburn, Palmetto, Chamblee and Decatur.
   Skipping the meeting was Mayor J.O. Stephenson of Kennesaw, the
Cobb County town that passed a mandatory gun ownership bill several
years ago in response to gun control initiatives elsewhere.
   ``It's ludicrous to think you can penalize law-abiding people
when criminals and crazy people are going to try to get them (guns)
any way they can,'' he said Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The nation's No. 1 dairy state on Friday
approved a temporary ban on use of a synthetic hormone that makes
cows give more milk.
   The measure, signed into law by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson,
prohibits all but experimental use of bovine growth hormone in
Wisconsin until June 1, 1991.
   After that, farmers would be able to inject their cows with the
hormone, which some consumer groups contend hasn't been adequately
tested for potential heal affects on humans who drink milk. A
similar bill is pending in Minnesota, another major milk-producing
state.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is allowing private
companies to test the hormone on farms, but has yet to approve it
for commercial use. Some of the milk from test herds has reached
the market, and the FDA contends that milk is safe.
   In signing the ban, Thompson vetoed a separate, stricter bill.
That measure would have banned used of the genetically engineered
hormone until six months after the FDA approved it for commercial
use.
   The Republican governor said the more extensive moratorium would
have put Wisconsin dairy farmers at a disadvantage against
competitors in states where the hormone could go into commercial
use immediately after FDA approval.
   The hormone, a copy of that which occurs naturally in cows, is
said to boost milk production by 10 percent to 20 percent.
   Under the new law, the hormone can be used over the next 14
months in Wisconsin, but only for experiments. Any milk produced by
injected cows would have to dumped.
   Supporters of the hormone warned that Wisconsin dairy farmers
could be hurt if the state became an ``island'' surrounded by
states that permitted its use.
   Opponents contended increased production could push milk prices
down, thus driving smaller dairy farmers out of business.

<HEAD>Oakland Anti-Nuclear Ordinance Ruled Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oakland's 1988 ``nuclear-free'' initiative,
one of the nation's broadest local bans on nuclear weapons-related
activities, was declared unconstitutional Friday by a federal judge.
   The ordinance forbids most city contracting, purchases and
investments with nuclear weapons manufacturers, restricts
transportation of nuclear material through the city and outlaws
most nuclear weapons work in the city.
   The federal government's lawsuit last September, the first it
has filed against any of the more than 160 local nuclear-free laws
in the country, said the Oakland ordinance interfered with
exclusive federal control of national defense, atomic energy and
shipments of hazardous materials.
   U.S. District Judge John Vukasin agreed with the government's
arguments in a brief ruling from the bench Friday. Earlier, Vukasin
had refused to let city officials or anti-nuclear groups examine
federal officials or documents to determine the extent of possible
interference with government operations.
   ``The Oakland ordinance is so comprehensive, so complete, so
all-encompassing that it is invalid on its face,'' the judge said.
``(It) cannot help but conflict with the rights of the federal
government.''
   The ruling is a potentially serious blow to a spreading campaign
by anti-nuclear activists to put teeth into previously symbolic
nuclear-free ordinances, chiefly by limiting local government
purchases and investments.
   A similar measure is on the June ballot in Alameda County, home
of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, where many of the nation's
nuclear weapons are designed.
   City Councilman Wilson Riles Jr., a supporter of the Oakland
ordinance, predicted that most of it would be revived by a higher
court.
   ``A lot of the things Oakland is trying to do with respect to
protecting the health and welfare of its citizens have long
standing in the law,'' Riles said. He said ordinances imposing
similar restrictions on South Africa-related purchases and
investments have been upheld in court.
   Steve Bloom, principal draftsman of the ordinance and
coordinator of a group called Nuclear-Free California, said the
decision was ``the kind of ruling Vukasin was appointed (by former
President Ronald Reagan) to make, not based on law but based on
political expediency.''
   Vukasin said he would issue a written decision later. It was not
clear whether his ruling extended to portions of the ordinance that
do not involve the government directly, such as a ban on city
purchases of products made by companies engaged in nuclear weapons
work.
   But the government's suit argued that enforcement of the
ordinance against its private contractors would also harm the
national defense.
   ``Private contractors are relied on a great deal by the United
States top carry out the national defense,'' Justice Department
lawyer Richard Stearns told Vukasin. He said any effort by the city
to ``punish contractors by denying them business with the city''
would harm the government as well.
   The only provisions expressly exempted from the ruling allow the
city to limit its investments in government securities and post
``nuclear-free-zone'' signs at its borders. Those provisions were
not challenged by the government.
   The Oakland ordinance, approved by a 57 percent vote in November
1988, declared that all ``nuclear weapons work,'' including
production, storage or classified research on nuclear weapons,
would be outlawed within two years in the city of 350,000.
   It also prohibited all city contracts and investments with
nuclear weapons-makers, unless no reasonable alternatives existed,
and authorized the City Council to choose the safest routes for
shipment of radioactive material.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Friday that
the United States is making a grave mistake in assisting rebels
fighting Angola's leftist government and is depriving Namibia of
needed help.
   He called for a Marshall Plan for Namibia and southern Africa.
   The civil rights leader and politician said newly independent
Namibia is getting $10 million in U.S. assistance, compared to $500
million for Poland. The Marshall Plan, first urged in 1947 by
then-Secretary of State George C. Marshall, fostered European
economic recovery after World War II through enormous infusions of
U.S. aid.
   Jackson spoke during a news conference sponsored by the
Organization of African Unity dealing with Namibia's achieving
independence this month from South Africa.
   Jackson said ``troublesome signs'' were emerging in
U.S.-southern African policy. He called it ``incoherent'' and asked
for a ``comprehensive plan and real commitment to end apartheid.''
   In Angola, he said, the United States was wrongly aiding rebels
led by Jonas Savimbi.
   He said the United States is sending the wrong signal to
southern Africa at a time when the Angolan government has announced
direct peace talks with the rebels and is trying to liberalize its
centralized economy.
   Jackson also said he learned through a newspaper article that
the United States was evading its own sanctions on South Africa and
was wrongly allowing imports of South African steel, through a
technicality.
   ``When we find this steel, we should protest and hold vigils
against it,'' he said. He called on states, municipalities and
individuals to oppose such imports.
   ``We need to keep strict sanctions against South Africa,'' he
said. Black leader ``Nelson Mandela is out of jail, but he is not
free. But (Solidarity leader) Lech Walesa of Poland is truly free.''

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Marcia Wallace's scheduled
appearance at a hospital cancer program this weekend has been
canceled because of her pro-choice position on abortion.
   The actress, probably best known for her role as Bob Newhart's
receptionist on ``The Bob Newhart Show'' in the 1970s, was
scheduled to speak about her successful fight against breast cancer
during a breast cancer awareness and education program.
   Officials at Providence-St. Margaret Health Center made the
decision Tuesday after the actress refused to take a ``no comment''
stance if the abortion issue arose, said spokeswoman Therese Horvat.
   The hospital, which is anti-abortion, feared that Ms. Wallace
might talk about her abortion views if asked by the media or
someone else attending the event, Ms. Horvat said in a statement
Thursday.
   Ms. Wallace said in a telephone interview from her Los Angeles
home that she was upset with the hospital's decision because her
views on abortion had nothing to do with her fight against cancer.
   She said she had no intention of raising the abortion issue in
her talk and had never taken a public stand. It came up only when
the hospital asked her for her views, she said Thursday.
   ``I cannot imagine why the hospital thought I would bring it
up,'' she said. ``I don't get the connection, but I hope women
really take advantage of the cancer awareness program.''

<HEAD>Government Announces Price Hikes, Higher Indirect Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new government on Friday announced an
economic austerity program including price increases, higher
indirect taxes and cuts in inflation-linked pay raises for public
employees.
   The moves came only hours after Premier Constantine Mitsotakis
and his conservative party won a vote of confidence in Parliament.
   The measures, aimed at increasing state income by $2.4 billion
this year, are also expected to trigger higher inflation, National
Economy Minister George Souflias told journalists. As it was,
inflation hit 17.8 percent in March.
   Consumers will quickly feel the pinch. Under the program,
electricity rates will rise by 12 percent, postal services by 15
percent, train tickets by 25 percent and domestic airfares by 25
percent.
   ``We have reached a dead end,'' Souflias said. ``Of every 100
drachmas the state spends it has to borrow 40. This has to come to
an end.''
   Mitsotakis told lawmakers before the confidence vote that the
total public debt would be $91.4 billion by the end of the year.
   Souflias said uncoupling state workers' pay and inflation will
mean a wage reduction of 6 percent in real terms. But he said it
would increase state revenue by $457 million.
   Companies and professionals will pay an extra 7 percent surtax
on profits this year. Fuel prices will rise immediately, with
super-grade gasoline going from $2 per gallon to $2.68. The value
added tax will increase, as will alcohol and tobacco taxes.
   The conservative New Democracy party won elections on April 8,
following two inconclusive polls last year. Mitsotakis has placed
the blame for the current economic woes on his Socialist
predecessors, who ruled for eight years.

<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of aerial spraying against
the Medfly are angry over a state decision to ban spraying in an
area where the endangered kangaroo rat roams.
   ``This says to me that kangaroo rats are more important than
humans,'' said Adelaide Nimitz of Burbank, who heads a group called
Families Opposed to Chemical Urban Spraying.
   The decision marked the second time this year the state has
granted an exemption from the malathion spraying program that some
people fear poses health hazards to humans.
   Three months ago, state agricultural officials angered Orange
County residents by ordering helicopters to spray around the Rev.
Robert H. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove because of
an outdoor event, attended by several thousand guests, that
coincided with the spraying.
   After the outcry, the state pledged to stop issuing exemptions _
until the kangaroo rat matter came up.
   State officials say federal law protecting endangered species
left them no choice but to avoid spraying areas where the rat
lives. The kangaraoo rat is a small, long-legged desert rodent
known for its jumping ability.
   ``This is a whole different thing,'' said Pat Minyard, deputy
director of the Medfly Project in El Monte. ``There's a radical
difference between doing something to be nice guys as in the case
of Crystal Cathedral and doing something because of the law.''
   The exemption affects a 5-square-mile area where the rats live
within a 19-square-mile Medfly spraying zone near Woodcrest and
March Air Force Base.
   ``I'm just appalled to think that rats have more rights in the
state's eyes than I do or my children,'' said Garden Grove
anti-malathion activist Mollie Haines.
   Malathion has been sprayed for months over a wide area of Los
Angeles County. Recent Medfly discoveries in Orange, San Bernardino
and Riverside counties prompted officials to widen spraying zones.
   Mediterranean fruit flies are under attack because they threaten
the state's multibillion dollar farm economy.

   President Omar Bongo on Friday named a
new prime minister to oversee the transition to a multiparty
democracy in this Central African nation.
   Bongo, who named Casimir Oye-Mba as the new prime minister, said
in a nationwide television address that Gabon is at the dawn of a
new era with a commitment ``to the democratic process.''
   Bongo has ruled this small, oil-rich nation since Nov. 28, 1967.
He has been under pressure for months to end one-party rule.
Anti-government demonstrations turned into riots in the capital,
Libreville, and in the oil center of Port Gentil.
   Last week Bongo met with opposition leaders and agreed to permit
opposition parties to contest the next legislative elections
against his Gabonese Democratic Party. No election date was set.
   The opposition also demanded that Bongo appoint a new government
before the elections. Friday night, Bongo announced Prime Minister
Leon Mebiame would be replaced by Oye-Mba, who would set up a new
government.
   Mebiame had been a leading member of Bongo's government for 20
years.

<TEXT>
   Romanians gathered at one of the
biggest rallies since the December revolution Friday in support of
interim President Ion Iliescu and in defiance of anti-communist
protesters seeking his resignation.
   Iliescu is the target of a six-day, round-the-clock protest by
Romanians who doubt he has really abandoned communism. On Friday he
urged more than 10,000 supporters to exercise tolerance of
opposition views, but attacked those who want him to step down.
   ``They can't rebuild the country if they choose to camp out on
the street without working,'' he told the crowd overflowing the
square in front of the military academy.
   Iliescu, 60, a former Communist Party secretary under Nicolae
Ceausescu, fell from Ceausescu's favor after opposing the dictator
and was given relatively minor party posts. He rose to prominence
in the revolution that toppled Ceausescu _ who was executed
Christmas Day _ and resulted in the disintegration of the Communist
Party.
   His foes accuse Iliescu and others in the National Salvation
Front of seeking to re-establish some form of Marxist rule, despite
repeated assertions that the Front embraces democracy.
   The Front dominates the interim government running Romania until
May 20 elections.
   Both Iliescu and Premier Petre Roman, another former Communist,
sought at the rally to emphasize their commitment to a pluralistic
democracy and a market economy.
   The president characterized the demise of communism as ``an
irreversible process taking place in all the countries which were
subjected to the so-called socialist society.''
   Iliescu defended his opposition to rapid economic change,
saying, ``It's well-known that we have already taken steps toward a
market economy ... but a brusque change is an adventure.''
   ``We have been burned before by the automatic transplanting of
foreign models here,'' Iliescu said, clearly alluding to the
disastrous attempt to introduce the Soviet system of the early
1950s that placed emphasis on heavy industry.
   The trial of Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, former head of the
Securitate secret police academy and brother of the dictator, was
suspended on Friday until May 29. The prosecution said it needed
time to investigate further.
   The panel of three military judges held that not enough evidence
now existed for a verdict. He is charged with ordering his cadets
to fire on demonstrators during the revolution and killing seven
protesters himself.

   A bomb in a package addressed to the
Rev. Pat Robertson exploded Friday at his Christian Broadcasting
Network's mailroom, injuring a security guard, CBN officials said.
   Police confirmed there was a bombing but refused to release
details. Robertson said the package was addressed to him, and
suggested it could be related to recent attacks on a Houston
preacher and gospel singer Sandi Patti. ``This could be part of a
pattern of attacks against evangelical Christians,'' Robertson said.
   The package had a North Carolina postmark and looked suspicious
to station workers, said Frankie Abourjilie, a CBN spokeswoman.
   Security guard Scott Scheepers was summoned, and the bomb
exploded when he opened the package, Mrs. Abourjilie said.
   Scheepers, 33, was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital,
were he was in stable condition with shrapnel wounds in his left
leg, said hospital spokeswoman Rhonda Hoover.
   Scheepers, who estimated he has handled 75 to 80 suspicious
packages, said from his hospital bed that he opened the brown-paper
parcel only after checking it twice with an X-ray machine.
   ``It appeared to be safe, it wasn't heavy at all,'' he said.
``I'd opened it about a half-inch and it just exploded.''
   Robertson, a 1988 Republican presidential hopeful, noted two
recent attacks _ the explosion of a letter bomb at the church of
the Rev. John Osteen of Houston that injured his daughter and an
arson fire at the Indiana recording studio of gospel singer Sandi
Patti.
   ``This is evidence of extreme hatred by some deranged
individuals who want to silence the Christian voice in this
country,'' Robertson said. ``They should realize that devices sent
through the mail will never reach those for whom they are intended.
Their victims will be innocent men and women who have devoted their
lives to serving God.''
   Virginia Beach police spokesman Lou Thurston declined to give
details about Friday's bomb.
   ``We don't want to jeopardize our investigation or
prosecution,'' Thurston said.
   He said the explosion caused no damage but debris from the
package was scattered about.
   Participating in the investigation were officers of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI, postal
inspectors, state and city police and the city fire dpeartment.
   Robertson said the bomb was a ``crude device. If it had been a
bit more sophisticated, it would have killed Scott.''
   Robertson, whose ``The 700 Club'' TV program is seen by an
estimated 965,000 households daily, said he did not plan to tighten
security.
   ``What we have to recognize as Christians is we are in a
spiritual battle. The work we are doing is effective but dangerous.
It's a front line activity,'' said Robertson, who noted he receives
monthly death threats.
   On Jan. 30, a shoebox size package exploded in the lap of
Osteen's daughter, Lisa, in Houston. She was not seriously injured.
Houston police said the package was postmarked from North Carolina.
   On April 17, Ms. Patti's recording studio in Anderson, Ind., was
heavily damaged by arson. An anonymous caller claiming to represent
a group called the Equal Religious Coalition claimed responsibility
for the blaze and said the studio was burned because Ms. Patti
``put herself on the pedestal of God.''
   Police in Anderson said they had never heard of the group but
were taking the claims seriously.

   A late-season snowstorm blasted parts of the high Plains on
Friday, while thunderstorms, tornados and hail moved on to bedevil
the South and Midwest after deluging Texas with killer floods.
   In Texas, high winds from at least 18 twisters and large hail
damaged houses and toppled power lines and trees Friday after three
days of severe thunderstorms. No major damage or injuries were
reported.
   But in the East, many were surprised by unseasonable weather of
a different kind: Temperatures soared as high as the low 90s,
toppling records from Cape Hatteras, N.C., to Sault Ste. Marie,
Mich.
   Snow fell over parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Wyoming on
Friday, and wind from the icy blast toppled power lines,
temporarily blacking out up to 30,000 homes in the Black Hills of
South Dakota. Power was restored to most customers within two hours
of the early-morning blackout, power company officials said.
   Snow piled up to 7 inches deep in the Black Hills overnight, 6
inches at Gillette, Wyo., and 5 inches at Sundance, Wyo.
   Forecasters warned more snow and freezing rain could fall
Saturday over parts of the Dakotas, western Montana and Idaho.
   Snow was forecast Friday night in the mountains of northeastern
Oregon and the Cascade Range.
   A band of thunderstorms stretched from eastern Texas across to
Alabama and up through the Midwest on Saturday, producing small
hail at Des Peres, Mo., and freezing rain in Minnesota. Tornado
watches were posted in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.
   In Texas, some communities ravaged Thursday by the storm system
began to return to normal Friday, but hard-hit Brown and Parker
counties in the north-central part of the state remained flooded.
   Workers struggled Friday to contain at least 2,500 gallons of
crude oil that spilled into Bass Lake, about 120 miles southwest of
Dallas, when pressure from high water burst a pipeline.
   They hoped to stop the oil from flowing down the Sabana River to
Lake Proctor, a water source for three counties.
   The line of storms was forecast to continue east Saturday,
stretching from Alabama to Michigan. Snow or rain was forecast for
the high Plains, while the rest of the country was expected to get
clear or partly cloudy skies.
   Among the spots where temperature records were broken Friday
were Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., 83; Toledo, Ohio, 87; Syracuse, N.Y.,
88; Boston, 92; Newark, 91 and Cape Hatteras, 89.
   The low for the nation this Friday was 19 degrees at Big Piney,
Wyo.

<HEAD>Gloria Estefan Files Lawsuit in Bus Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SCRANTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for singer Gloria Estefan filed
suit in federal court Thursday seeking damages for a March accident
that broke two vertebrae in her back.
   The lawsuit named two truck drivers, their employers and other
companies associated with the trucking firms at the time of the
accident.
   Ms. Estefan, lead singer of the Miami Sound Machine, was joined
in the lawsuit by her husband, Emilio; her son, Nayib; her personal
aide, Barbara Arencibia, and her son's tutor, Lori Rooney. Estefan
works with his wife as her producer and manager.
   The lawsuit seeks damages in excess of $50,000 on each of eight
separate counts filed on behalf of the singer, individually and
jointly. The other plaintiffs are also seeking more than $50,000
each on numerous counts.
   Named as defendants were Heraldo E. Samuels; Ventura Transport,
Inc.; Flexi-Van Leasing, Inc.; Maersk, Inc.; Maersk Canada, Inc.;
Maersk Line Limited, Maersk Container Service Co., Inc.; Anthony D.
Naro and Naro Enterprises, Inc.
   The lawsuit charges the defendants with recklessness,
carelessness and negligence and alleges Ms. Estefan, ``a world
famous professional performer and entertainer,'' was prevented from
pursuing her profession, which resulted in the loss of ``many
millions of dollars.''
   Ms. Estefan and her family and staff were headed from
Washington, D.C., to a concert engagement at Syracuse, N.Y., when
their bus came upon the scene of a tractor-trailer accident shortly
after noon on March 20.
   The truck, operated by Naro, an employee of Naro Enterprises,
had jack-knifed, bringing westbound traffic on Interstate 380 to a
standstill.
   As the bus waited in traffic, it was rear-ended by another
tractor-trailer, operated by Samuels, an employee of Ventura
Transport. The truck was owned by Flexi-van Leasing, and was
hauling a Maersk container, the suit charged.
   The accident left Ms. Estefan with two broken vertebrae. The day
after the accident, she was airlifted from a Scranton where she was
initially treated, to the Orthopedic Institute Hospital for Joint
Diseases in New York City, N.Y.
   Surgery to repair her back was performed in New York and she
later moved back to her Miami area home to recuperate. She has not
yet resumed her career.

<TEXT>
   Police in Northern Ireland on
Thursday called for public vigilance to try to stave off an
expected series of attacks by the Irish Republican Army.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association quoted
unidentified sources as saying the warning was not a routine one,
and that it was based on intelligence information that a wave of
bombing and shooting attacks was planned.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary headquarters warned the public to
be ``extremely vigilant'' in ``the period immediately ahead,'' and
asked people to report anything suspicious.
   News reports meanwhile said Thursday that police believed a
23-year-old Protestant man gunned down in a Roman Catholic
neighborhood was slain by a Protestant gang.
   Brian McKimm, a father of three, was hit by several gunshots
Wednesday night as he walked along the boundary of the Ligoniel
housing estate, police said. He lived in a Protestant area nearly.
   Press Association, BBC-TV and Channel 4 TV News reported that
police believe the killers were Loyalist extremists, but a
spokesman in the Royal Ulster Constabulary press office declined to
comment on those reports.
   Witnesses said four gunmen drove away slowly in two cars, as if
they were looking for other targets, according to Press Association.
   Belfast council member Brian Feeney, of the predominantly Roman
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, on Thursday called the
slaying a reminder of ``the terrifying random nature of attacks by
Loyalist gangs.''
   Loyalist extremists favor British rule in the
Protestant-dominated province while the Irish Republican Army and
other republican groups are fighting to unite Northern Ireland with
the overwhelmingly Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   McKimm was the 19th person to die in political and sectarian
violence this year in Northern Ireland.

   Maoist Shining Path rebels gunned down two
policemen Thursday who were eating breakfast at a roadside
restaurant north of Lima, police said.
   The rebels then blew up the officers' car and fled on foot,
abandoning their own auto near the site of the attack, 14 miles
north of the capital.
   The shootings set off a police manhunt in Lima's northern and
western shantytowns. Dozens of buses were stopped and hundreds of
people detained.
   The night before, acting on information that an attack was
imminent, police rounded up more than 4,000 people in a similar
sweep of Lima shantytowns.
   Meanwhile, police said Thursday that six members of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement had died in a battle Wednesday night
with police in the central Andean town of Chupaca.
   Police said they suffered no casualties in the attack on their
post by about 50 guerrillas.
   The pro-Cuban group, which took up arms in 1984, is a smaller,
less radical guerrilla organization than the Shining Path.
   The first half of April was the bloodiest two-week period since
the Shining Path rebels took up arms in 1980. The government said
about 300 people died in political violence during the period,
immediately before and after general elections.
   More than 18,000 people have died in Peru's political violence
since 1980, the government says.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ More than 500 demonstrators marched
through the capital on Thursday chanting slogans demanding an end
to army violence and asking for justice for victims of military
repression.
   The marchers, mostly young slum dwellers, moved along to
drumbeats, carrying signs reading ``There is no Democracy without
Justice!'' and ``Justice before elections!''
   The protest was called in memory of seven people killed in front
of the prison fortress Fort Dimanche during a demonstration in
1986. The prison has been closed.
   ``We must stand up and be heard, so that the government will
satisfy the people's demands,'' read a communique of the leftist
Committee of United Popular Forces that organized the march.
   The demonstrators also protested army occupation last week of
Cabaret, a village outside the capital of Port-au-Prince. Residents
there were marching to protest a monthlong power outage when
soldiers moved in.
   The army allegedly burned down 34 homes after protesters killed
a sergeant who had shot and wounded three people. Almost 50
villagers were arrested and reportedly beaten. Nearly 20 people
remain in custody.
   Thurday's demonstration ended without incident in the public
square facing the Presidential Palace.
   The civilian caretaker government of Mrs. Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot, which took power on March 13, is not believed to
wield much power with the army, which turned power over to her
until elections are held this year.
   She was named to head a caretaker government after violent
demonstrations against the military rule of Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril
forced him to flee Haiti.
   The commemorative demonstration began in front of the charred
ruins of St. Jean Bosco Church, where goon squads killed at least
12 worshipers and wounded 70 on Sept. 11, 1988.
   Only one person has been charged with complicity in the incident
and no investigation is in progress. Similarly, no one has been
charged with the November 1987 election day massacre in which 34
voters were killed at the polls by thugs backed by soldiers.

<HEAD>Li Peng Returns From Soviet Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng on Friday returned from a
four-day visit to the Soviet Union. He was China's first head of
government to make the trip in 26 years and helped to mend
relations between the two Communist giants.
   During Li's meetings with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
and Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, the two sides agreed to improve
political and economic relations and work toward easing military
tension along their common border.
   According to official reports, the leaders discussed the war in
Cambodia, the Korean peninsula and disarmament. The Soviet Union,
which has had increasing unofficial contacts with Taiwan, expressed
support for the Chinese position that Taiwan is an inalienable part
of the territory of the People's Republic of China.
   Li, who favors strong central control over the economy, also
discussed the two countries' reform policies with Gorbachev, and
the two leaders agreed there is no single model for realizing
communist ideals.
   Chinese leaders are reportedly critical of Gorbachev's policies
of perestroika and glasnost _ restructuring and openness _ and
blame the Soviet reforms for East Europe's rejection of traditional
socialist models.
   The Soviet Union was China's main benefactor and closest ally
from 1949, when the Chinese communists gained power, until 1960.
Differences over ideology led to a split in the early 1960s, and
the two fought a brief border war in 1969.
   Relations have slowly improved since the mid-1980s but were not
formally normalized until Gorbachev visited Beijing last May.
   The last Chinese premier to visit Moscow was Li's foster father,
Chou En-lai, in 1964.
   During Li's visit, agreements were signed on cooperation in
energy, transport, agriculture, environmental protection and space.
The two sides agreed to mutually reduce armed forces on the
4,300-mile border and keep troops to a ``minimum corresponding to
normal good-neighborly relations.''
   China said it will grant credits to the Soviet Union to buy $330
million worth of consumer goods, while the Soviet Union is to
provide credits to build two nuclear power plants generating 1
million megawatts each.

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perrier returned to a third state Thursday
despite a last-minute wrangle with health authorities that took
some of the sparkle out of the promotional blitz over the bottled
mineral water.
   Perrier, absent from the market since February because of a
chemical scare, was reintroduced in Connecticut and New Jersey on
Tuesday.
   The company _ which has been advertising its impending return
for some time _ launched a promotional campaign in New York on
Thursday that included passing out the green bottles on Manhattan
streets.
   ``We're calling it Perrier Day,'' said Jane Lazgin, a
spokeswoman for Greenwich, Conn.-based Perrier Group of America Inc.
   Distribution is planned for other states in the east later this
month and in the Los Angeles area by mid-May, said.
   The company recalled its bottled water worldwide in February
after tests showed traces of benzene, a cancer-causing chemical.
The company said the amounts were so small as to pose no health
threat, and said the benzene came from improper filtration of
carbon dioxide gas added to the water.
   Then last week, in the midst of the build-up for reintroduction
of Perrier _ in bottles labled ``nouvelle production'' _ the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration refused to let the water be labled
``naturally sparkling.''
   That brought another round of bad press for Perrier, touted as a
healthful, naturally sparkling mineral water.
   Perrier officials went along, even though they insist the
carbonation and water both come from the spring, but the carbon
dioxide is separated and filtered before being put back in the
water.
   In New York, reintroduction planned for Wednesday was delayed by
yet another disagreement with health regulators, this one over salt
content.
   One of many chemical test results submitted by the company
showed higher levels of sodium than allowed under federal standards
for products advertising themselves as being low-sodium, said
William Fagal, department spokesman.
   Perrier, already nervous about consumer questions about its
purity, said many other tests showed no problems with sodium, he
said.
   The company and Health Department finished negotiating terms of
the reintroduction Wednesday night.
   New York inspectors were still finding old bottles of Perrier
from before the recall on store shelves and also wanted to make
sure the company had sufficient plans for retrieving them,
according to William Stasiuk, director of the Health Department's
Center for Environmental Health.

   Angry farmers dumped three truckloads of
potatoes and blockaded entrances to the state television building
on Thursday to protest government refusal to buy surplus crops.
   A report on the evening TV news showed passers-by scooping up
the potatoes.
   Earlier, the same farmers drove past the Ministry of Agriculture
and Parliament in their trucks.
   Deputy Prime Minister Czeslaw Janicki received a delegation of
farmers and pledged that state-run potato processing plants and
other factories would buy some of the surplus.
   The previous Communist government routinely intervened to
purchase surplus crops, but the Solidarity-led government is
committed to free market principles.
   A government economic reform plan that took effect on Jan. 1
ended most state subisidies and price supports.
   Farmers say the government should compensate them for the drop
in demand, especially since the cost of equipment, fuel and
electricity have risen significantly.
   The farmers were also demanding greater access to the media.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
said Thursday his government will resume peace talks with leftist
rebels next week but the talks would be indirect, with a United
Nations official acting as a go-between.
   He told a news conference no specific time and place have yet
been set for direct talks, but that U.N. official Alvaro de Soto
will be on hand as of May 2 to mediate.
   De Soto's mission will be mainly to arrange direct talks.
   The contacts come under an agreement reached in Geneva last
month by Cristiani's conservative administration and the Farabundo
Marti National Liberation Front guerrillas.
   ``We believe that with the renewal this effort ... we are on our
way toward initiating the process of dialogue,'' Cristiani said.
   Last week, Cristiani said his government planned to resume the
talks May 3 in a Central American capital or in Caracas, Venezuela,
but did not go into specifics.
   Human rights groups estimate that 72,000 people, most of them
civilians, have been killed since civil war began in El Salvador in
October 1979.
   Attempts to initiate a dialogue by a previous Christian
Democratic administration in 1984 and 1985 ended in deadlock.
   Direct talks between the two side started shortly after
Cristiani took office last June, but broke down after the
guerrillas launched a major offensive in early November.
   In a communique, the front on Thursday expressed willingness to
resume the talks and said it will continue to refrain from
attacking businesses, communications, transportation and civilian
government officials.
   But the communique warned the guerrillas will continue
sabotaging the nation's power grid and harassing military positions
``to make sure the government sits down to negotiate.''
   In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted to
halve U.S. military aid to El Salvador and impose strict new
conditions on the money. On a voice vote, the Democratic-controlled
panel moved to cut the $85 million a year that the United States
provides to help El Salvador's military.
   The action amended a bill that would authorize spending of
emergency aid President Bush wants this year for Nicaragua and
Panama.

<TEXT>
   A former mail carrier was sentenced
to six months in jail Thursday for shooting a dog to death just as
its owner was about to hand him his Christmas present.
   Floyd Bertran Sterling, 35, pleaded no contest to felony cruelty
to animals in a plea-bargain agreement with prosecutors on Feb. 21.
In return, charges of carrying a concealed weapon and negligent gun
use were dropped.
   Sterling could have faced one year in jail. He was on probation
for illegal possession of a handgun at the time of the shooting.
   ``I have sold all of my guns,'' Sterling told Superior Court
Judge Meredith Taylor before sentencing. ``I have no intention of
ever owning a gun again.''
   The mail carrier killed Tammie Brody's German shepherd mix named
Skippy in the front yard of her home on Dec. 26. Brody said her dog
was shot just as she was about to hand Sterling a bottle of vodka
as a Christmas gift. The shooting was witnessed by Brody's
10-year-old son, Brian.
   Sterling had said Skippy was a vicious dog and had bitten him
before. Brody testified that he ``freaked out'' and fired a
.22-caliber revolver without provocation.
   The bullet entered the dog at the rear and traveled to the front
of its body, suggesting the animal may have been shot while running
away from Sterling.
   Taylor imposed sentence after reviewing psychiatric reports on
Sterling, who resigned his job in March.
   The U.S. Postal Service paid the $773.50 bill for Skippy's
funeral and burial in a silk-linked casket at a pet cemetery in
Calabasas.

<HEAD>Ivana Trump Tries to Cancel `Singles' Contract</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tempestuous Trumps are at it again.
   Ivana Trump, appalled at press coverage of a pact that allowed
her and estranged billionaire husband, Donald, to date, Thursday
ordered her attorneys to cancel the contract.
   But Trump's attorneys said the contract, which reportedly would
allow her and Trump to date without providing grounds for divorce,
remains in effect.
   The contract drew attention earlier this week from New York's
tabloids which published headlines such as ``Safe Sex,'' and
``Donald and Ivana Playing Singles Games.''
   In a statement, Mrs. Trump said the agreement was misunderstood
and misrepresented by the press. The intent of the pact, she said,
was to protect her children.
   ``The last thing I want in the world is to start to date,'' Mrs.
Trump said. ``I love my husband. Men are the last thing on my mind
and I do not want my husband's lawyers to misinterpret my going out
socially with friends or having male employees.''
   Mrs. Trump also said, ``I cannot be hiding or reclusive for the
rest of my life. I want to go on seeing my friends and go on
living. I had hoped that this agreement would preclude any
speculations about my friends, friendships, male employees.''
   Stan Lotwin, Trump's attorney, said he doubted the cancellation
would be challenged because, as far as he was concerned, the pact
remains in force. Lotwin noted the April 11 contract was to be in
effect for 60 days at which point either party could cancel.
   Of the ``dating'' contract, Lotwin said,
   ``It was requested by her attorney. It was written by her
attorney. And, now, because she doesn't like the public reaction,
she wants out,'' he said.

<HEAD>New York City, State Reach Agreement on $600M Cleanup of City
Dumps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The city and state reached agreement Thursday on
a $600 million plan to clean up the city's contaminated garbage
dumps, including the world's largest landfill, Fresh Kills on
Staten Island.
   The agreement obligates the city and state to clean up landfills
where hazardous wastes were dumped illegally, Mayor David Dinkins
and state Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling
said at a City Hall news conference.
   ``We all know the damage that we, the human species, have done
to our home,'' Dinkins said. ``Now we must begin to undo it.''
   The agreement includes a five-year $200 million cleanup at the
3,000-acre, 150-foot-high Fresh Kills landfill, and $400 million to
purge four of the city's now-closed dumps of pollutants.
   Under the agreement, the state has withdrawn its 1989 threat to
close the Fresh Kills landfill and dropped the $81 million in fines
it had levied against the city.
   The pact allows the city to operate Fresh Kills until 1998 as
long as it goes ahead with cleanup operations.
   The Fresh Kills facility handles nearly 17,000 tons of solid
waste and ash daily and is one of only two operating municipal
landfills in the city.
   It was described in 1981 by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency as an ``open dump.''
   Jorling said the agreement represents ``a full commitment by New
York City to eliminate the sources of contamination from these
major facilities and remove the environmental and public health
threats that the landfills pose.''
   The agreement paves the way for the city to receive about $300
million under the 1986 state Environmental Quality Bond Act to
cover 75 percent of the cost of cleaning up the four closed
landfills by 1998.
   The city already has collected $30 million in settlements from
13 corporations that generated toxic waste in a case involving
Exxon, the mayor's office said. The city has filed claims against
150 other companies it said were responsible for pollution.
   Any proceeds from the lawsuit will be used to pay for the
cleanup operations at the four inactive landfills.

<HEAD>Hedrick Smith Redux: `Inside Gorbachev's U.S.S.R.'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was 1971, and Nikita Khrushchev was three
days dead without a mention in the Soviet press.
   Hedrick Smith, in his first week as Moscow bureau chief for The
New York Times, went for the man-in-the-street angle.
   ``They didn't want to talk to me. They ran the other way,''
Smith said. But that was before Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost opened
Soviet society.
   It was different in May 1988, when Smith was beginning work on
``Inside Gorbachev's U.S.S.R.,'' an insightful, four-part series
starting tonight on PBS. Again, he went for the man-in-the-street
interview.
   ``Instead of having people run the other way, they gathered,''
Smith said. Some even complained about their country. And even
though they were surrounded by police, no one was shouted down or
dragged away.
   ``To have that happening on the street and to hear the kinds of
things people had to say was just an extraordinary change for me,''
said Smith, a two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner and author of the 1976
best seller ``The Russians.''
   ``Inside Gorbachev's U.S.S.R.'' puts a fascinating, human face
on the fundamental changes resulting from Gorbachev's doctrine of
perestroika, or restructuring of Soviet society.
   ``I don't think that people in America understand the enormity
of the change,'' Smith said. ``We're talking about people being
jerked bodily into the 21st century from a mentality somewhere in
the autocratic 18th or 19th century.''
   The four programs cover the changes in Soviet politics, the mass
media, the foundering economy and the recent tumultuous events in
the ethnic republics. The first episode, ``The Taste of
Democracy,'' examines the foundations of perestroika, using
excellent archival photos and footage to track Gorbachev's rise to
power and the systemic failure of the Soviet bureaucracy.
   It also identifies Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Josef
Stalin in 1956 as the central event of Gorbachev's political
generation, and documents the Soviets' growing awareness of their
power over their government and themselves.
   The second installment, ``Comfortable Lies, Bitter Truths,''
shows the burgeoning influence of Soviet television, and the
Soviets painfully relearning and rewriting their own history.
   The episode, elegiacally photographed by Wiley Foster, visits
the forests of Kuropaty, one of eight mass gravesites around Minsk
holding the bodies of an estimated 250,000 victims of Stalin's
purges. It is powerful and moving.
   ``That's one of the most horrible places I have ever been,''
Smith said in a small, sad voice, describing a forest pocked with
thousands of declivities, each marking six to a dozen bodies.
   ``The land ... it looks like it's got scarlet fever,'' he said,
his voice breaking. ``The holes everywhere ... there's no way a
camera can get how many there are.''
   The third episode, ``In Search of Perestroika,'' shows a
centralized economy frustrating its fledgling capitalists and its
state factory managers, who face shortages of labor, raw materials,
transportation and marketing.
   It's in the economic domain where Gorbachev's moderation most
clearly is failing, Smith said.
   ``Piecemeal measures just ain't going to work,'' he said. ``I
really do wonder whether he has not gotten about as far as he can
go.''
   The fourth installment, ``Coming Apart,'' focuses on the restive
republics of Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Lithuania.
   Smith said he expects Gorbachev's U.S.S.R. in the next
quarter-century to reflect a ``roller coaster'' of conservatism
vying with liberal reform.
   The Soviet Union, he said, has to make up for 200 years of
history that took place in the West.
   Can Gorbachev succeed?
   ``In a way, the answer is that he could succeed wildly in the
next five years and disappear,'' Smith said. ``Somebody else would
come along and you'd still be asking the same questions, because
the task is so enormous.''

<HEAD>Oprah Winfrey Back In ABC's ``Brewster's Place''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oprah Winfrey's ``Brewster Place,'' which began
as the high-rated ``The Women of Brewster Place'' miniseries of
last year, starts life anew tonight as a half-hour ABC series.
   Alas, it has an oddly tame, although pleasant, premiere.
   Filmed in Chicago at Harpo Studios, where Winfrey also does her
syndicated talk show, the series is about the lives of big-city
blacks in 1967. It has a lot of things going for it, particularly
Winfrey's acting.
   She's eminently believable as the lead character, Mattie
Michael, a wise, steady single woman to whom fate has dealt a few
hard knocks, but who faces life with dignity and a certain
down-home grace.
   The show's other pluses: an optimistic view of life, a fine
ensemble cast and David Shire's sprightly, lovely no-words theme
song that verges close to Bach in its rendition by the fine a
capella group, Take Six.
   (A first-rate singer and composer, Oscar Brown Jr., also lurks
in the cast as Jessie, the husband of the neighborhood busybody.)
   But the show's future episodes are going to need a bit more bite
and true grit if the series is to make its way in this wicked
world, a world in which the new buzz phrase of networks is ``get
weird,'' as in ``Twin Peaks.''
   Co-written by Earl Hamner, who did ``The Waltons,'' the premiere
is a gentle lesson on the need, after misfortune strikes, to pick
yourself up, dust yourself off and start all over again, preferably
in a new direction.
   But Winfrey's Michael, with all her strength, can't bring
herself to make such a dramatic move, even when fired from her
hairdresser's job at a local beauty parlor after refusing to help
bilk her trusting customers.
   Save for work as a domestic, her job prospects are dim because
of her lack of formal education and skills that could lead to, say,
a secretary's job.
   She has a nest egg that she's saved up in recent years. But she
can't bring herself to bet it on herself in a business venture. The
reason: she was financially ruined before by her own son.
   It turns out he had been arrested _ the charge isn't specified _
and jumped bail. He left his mother, who had put up her home as
security for bail money, flat broke.
   When she's fired from her hairdresser's job, her best friend,
Etta Mae (Brenda Pressley), urges a big change _ becoming her
partner in a local Italian restaurant. Etta Mae has a beau who will
loan her half the money.
   Etta Mae isn't embarrassed that her friend says she's dreaming.
``Damn right,'' she snaps. ``And you look to me like you could use
a good dream.''
   The restaurant is being sold by an old, decent man who blames
age, not the changing racial nature of the neighborhood, for the
slide in his business.
   ``The neighborhood's changed,'' he says. `` All my customers,
they got old like me, moved to Miami.''
   There are such men, to be sure. But this suggestion of racial
harmony just doesn't ring true. Neither does the generally sweet,
good-hearted nature of most everyone in and around this
make-believe Brewster Place.
   And you know, almost from the start, that Mattie is going to see
the light and take a chance. Of course, that's after other
characters are established and she helps her widowed cousin and his
three kids, all fresh in from Arkansas, move into their new
Brewster Place apartment.
   In a way, the opening show is almost a black urban counterpart
of Hamner's ``The Waltons,'' with its emphasis on decency and
optimism, and even occasional narration by the lead charatcer.
   It's all well and good to revive what that rural, predominantly
white-cast CBS series represented _ kinder, gentler television.
   But a bit more realism would help ``Brewster Place,'' too.
   Incidentally, the show will be seen again next Tuesday. The day
after that, it will settle into ABC's Wednesday night schedule.
   Two Tuesday showings may seem an odd way to get a Wednesday
night series going. But gosh, folks, that's why they invented TV
executives.

<HEAD>Liberia 10 Years Later: Economic Collapse and Civil War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GANTA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many Liberians cheered 10 years ago when a
young army sergeant threw out the autocratic old order, but no
more. Now Samuel K. Doe presides over a shattered economy and civil
war is feeding tribal hatreds.
   Some who welcomed the coup even wish for the days before
President Doe, when this West African country was dominated by a
small elite descended from the freed American slaves who founded it
in 1847.
   At a banquet April 12, the coup anniversary, Doe blamed the poor
economy and high unemployment on low world prices for Liberia's raw
materials.
   The president, now a portly, self-appointed general, told the
scores of diplomats, officials and business leaders invited for
Redemption Day: ``We recall the events of the past 10 years with
considerable pride.''
   Applause for the speech was so feeble the master of ceremonies
exhorted guests to raise a cheer.
   A Liberian muttered, ``What we need is redemption from Doe.''
   Doe has changed army commanders five times in an effort to
defeat rebels led by Charles Taylor, a former aide who was accused
of embezzlement and fired.
   Army soldiers have held Ganta, a garrison town, but lost most of
the rest of Nimba County, an area of 4,400 square miles that juts
east between Guinea on the north and Ivory Coast.
   Since Dec. 24, when they invaded Nimba from Ivory Coast,
Taylor's ragtag rebels have pushed south into River Cess County,
southwest to Grand Bassa County and west to Bong County.
   They have halted traffic on the railroad serving an iron mine
that normally earns half Liberia's foreign exchange. All but two of
the Americans and Britons who run the mine have left.
   Nimba, which covers about 10 percent of the country, is an area
of dense forests, highlands and mountains. It produced more than 20
percent of Liberia's food, but at least four-fifths of its 350,000
people have fled the fighting to Ivory Coast, Guinea and other
parts of their own country.
   Killing, raping and looting by government soldiers have won the
rebels hundreds of recruits. What could have been a minor rebellion
has become a major tribal conflict.
   Most of the refugees are of the Gio and Mano tribes, as are many
rebels.
   Members of those tribes have been army targets, and rebels
retaliate by killing civilians of Doe's Krahn tribe and the
Mandingo tribe, which supports Doe.
   No one knows how many civilians have been killed. International
human rights organizations and aid agencies estimate soldiers have
killed hundreds of civilians and the rebels have slain scores.
   Diplomats and aid workers in Monrovia said rebels ``lined up and
shot'' Krahn and Mandingo civilians when they captured Kombo Town
in River Cess County, southwest of Nimba. Refugees admitted seeing
such reprisals.
   Young men have been pressed into service to strengthen the
5,000-man army and criminals freed by presidential amnesty have
been put into uniform, Liberian and Western sources reported.
   ``Most of them fire 15 shots in training,'' a European diplomat
said. ``They are a frightened, illiterate, superstitious bunch
expected to put their lives on the line for $1.50 a day.''
   Many desert, but the government denies it.
   The government will not say what the war costs, but Doe
announced in January he was diverting money set aside to register
voters for 1991 elections. By Redemption Day, many civil servants
had not been paid for three months.
   Taylor, the 42-year-old rebel leader, escaped from a jail in the
United States in 1984. He was being held for extradition to face
charges of embezzling $1 million.
   Thousands of Liberians embraced the revolution when Doe seized
power April 12, 1980, even though he killed ousted President
William S. Tolbert and 30 other prominent Americos, as the
descendants of Liberia's founders are called.
   The 29-year-old master sergeant promised equality regardless of
tribe and an end to corruption, human rights abuses, nepotism and
domination by the Americos. Doe also pledged to return power to
civilians.
   He delivered economic collapse and brutal repression of dissent.
He held an election and won it, but Western diplomats say it was
rigged.
   Then came the rebellion.
   ``Tribal hatred engendered by the conflict is terrifying,'' one
Liberian said. ``Many of us are saying our only hope is to look for
a leader among reasonably minded Americos.''
   William Gabriel Kpoleh, leader of the opposition Liberian
Unification Party, said: ``What Doe has done is replace one
privileged set of rulers with another, his Krahn tribe.''
   Kpoleh was freed last month by presidential pardon after serving
two years in jail for plotting against Doe. The charges were phony,
he said in an interview at the office of a friend.
   Security agents told the friend ``they will burn down his
building if he lets me work here,'' Kpoleh said.
   Last month, the offices of the independent Daily Observer in
Monrovia burned down. A night watchman said four men in military
uniforms set the fire and told him it was punishment for
anti-government reports.
   Two U.S. government warehouses were destroyed by fire, just as
U.S. relations with Liberia reached their lowest ebb.
   American aid, including millions for the military, used to be
the highest per capita in sub-Saharan Africa, totaling more than
$500 million in 1980-85. It was cut to $10 million this year by
congressmen who cited human rights abuses and failure to repay
loans.
   Doe told reporters recently his government has faced ``all kinds
of coup attempts and invasions'' intended to ``discourage potential
investors.''
   Businessmen say corruption is enough deterrent, that Liberia is
rich in resources but Doe has emulated previous administrations
whose leaders looked after themselves.
   Miners from Lebanon extract gold and diamonds, one businessman
said, ``But the country gets little out of it because they pay huge
bribes to government officials to smuggle them out.''
   There is little industry. Liberia is one of the world's richest
sources of rubber, but imports tires.
   An overvalued currency, set at parity with the U.S. dollar,
makes imports expensive. Grapefruit and pineapples are grown in
Liberia, but restaurants offer imported canned juices at up to $5 a
glass.
   ``It's easy to ask what a country of just 2.2 million people did
with all the aid money,'' former Finance Minister David M. Farhat
said in an interview. ``Most of it was poured into projects that
are completely useless.''
   Kpoleh said Doe's bloody method of dealing with rivals sickens
Liberians.
   It began with the killings at the time of the coup. Since then,
more than 20 government ministers and army officers have been
executed for allegedly plotting coups, and dozens more have died in
unexplained circumstances.

<HEAD>Liberian Refugees Overrun Guinean Villages</HEAD>
<HEAD>With A Decade of Doe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GOSSOPA, Guinea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of refugees fleeing the
brutality of Liberian soldiers are crossing the border and
inundating villages like Gossopa.
   Many are filled with tribal hatred and vow to return home for
revenge.
   ``They killed my mother. They killed my sister. They killed my
little brother,'' a 34-year-old businessman said. ``Now, I'm
joining the rebels and I'm going to kill them, especially those
Krahns.''
   Liberia's president, Samuel K. Doe, is of the Krahn tribe.
   Guinean officials complain of slow international response to
help feed a refugee population they said had doubled in April to
more than 150,000.
   ``Up to now, we have received nothing but promises from the
international community, with the exception of France, Ireland and
Sierra Leone,'' said Aboubacar Fabou Conde, the second-ranking
government official at N'zerekore, a provincial capital near the
frontier.
   The World Food Program said emergency food approved Feb. 26 was
bought locally in Conakry, capital of Guinea, and was being sent to
the refugee area 635 miles away.
   Diane Weather, an information officer at the U.N. agency's Rome
headquarters, said poor roads along the heavily forested border
often deteriorated into rutted tracks, so transportation was
uncertain.
   She said 3,640 tons of rice, canned fish and oil were being sent
and would help feed 80,000 people for six months. Ms. Weather said
the agency believed the estimate of 150,000 refugees was high.
   Guineans expressed fear that, by the time the size of the
refugee population was recognized, it would be too late to deliver
food before a six-month rainy season.
   ``The Guinean government has done everything it can,'' Conde
said. ``Our villagers have exhausted their food reserves and even
eaten seed grain, so now there is nothing to plant and the rainy
season is upon us.''
   Diplomats said politics also had slowed aid. Relief agencies had
hoped to move food by truck from Monrovia, capital of Liberia, a
drive of six to 10 hours over a good road.
   The journey from Conakry takes four or five days in the rainy
season.
   Doe's government refused because it wants the refugees
repatriated, then the point became moot April 13, when rebels cut
the road with an attack on Ganta, near the border.
   The most recent refugee influx came from Sanniquellie, capital
of Nimba County, a part of Liberia that juts east between Guinea
and Ivory Coast. The town is believed to have changed hands four
times in the second week of April.
   At N'zerekore, Guinean officials welcomed more than a dozen
civil administrators from Sanniquellie. Their abandoned vehicles
could be seen across the St. John's River, the border at that
point, which they crossed on foot.
   Gossopa, nearby, normally has 800 residents but was sheltering
3,500 refugees in March and 5,906 in April.
   Fifteen of the refugees were Liberian army soldiers who fled the
fighting across the river.
   ``We were plotting to kill those soldiers,'' said a 20-year-old
high school student. Like other refugees, he would not give his
name because he feared for relatives still in Liberia.
   Warrant Officer George Newray and the other soldiers denied
allegations of brutality.
   Of his own retreat from the fighting, he said: ``The rebels were
stronger than us and better armed. My friend was killed beside me
when the rebels attacked. We ran out of ammunition, So I decided to
effect the army code of SEE: survival, evasion and escape.''
   He claimed he ran into and escaped from a white man dressed in
an ``olden-time red military dress uniform like the Romans and a
gas mask ... who is known to help command rebels.''
   Then he was confronted by ``a medicine woman at the rebel
command post who started performing juju (magic) and turned into a
snake,'' Newray said.
   Such stories are common. One Liberian in Gossopa said soldiers
believe ``rebels hide powder in their pants that makes them
disappear or fly away.''
   Refugees were openly sympathetic to the rebels, who they said
ordered all civilians into Sanniquellie Hospital when they took the
town ``because they said they did not want us harmed in the
fighting.''
   One said refugees had returned regularly for food and other
belongings. ``When I went the last time,'' he said, ``the rebels
drove me to my house, helped me pack up my belongings, killed my
hog for me and transported it to the border.''
   After the government announced April 14 that the army had
retaken Sanniquellie, they were afraid to return, the refugees said.
   ``The soldiers steal everything _ food, clothing _ and they burn
down our homes,'' one of them told a reporter.
   Refugees said villagers who remain in Nimba had formed militias
allied with the rebels to protect property from marauding troops.
The men of Nimba are traditional hunters and most have shotguns.

<HEAD>New Visa Rules Worry Music Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boundaries may be opening worldwide, but some
in the entertainment industry say the United States border is
getting tougher to cross for anyone with a guitar and the ability
to carry a tune.
   They're concerned that new visa rules will allow superstars such
as Paul McCartney to pull in millions at U.S. concerts while
singers who have more promise than paychecks are left trying to win
over an audience of American immigration officials.
   ``There's clear and away an aversion by some people to
contemporary, international music being brought into this
country,'' says Bill Kitchen of Cellar Door Productions, a major
East Coast concert promoter.
   The new U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service rules spell
out tougher standards for temporary workers coming into the United
States. Would-be visitors have to prove that American workers can't
do the same job, and artists have to show they've gained
recognition _ and made a living _ at their art.
   French Culture Minister Jack Lang complained this month that if
impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh were working today rather
than 100 years ago, he couldn't get a visa for the United States.
   So far, say promoters and agents, it doesn't appear as if any
fledgling Beatles have been turned away at Customs since the new
rules took effect Feb. 26.
   But they say the regulations follow tighter rules over the past
decade that have led to some tours being canceled at the last
minute. And they fear American stages may be out of reach for
artists who can't afford immigration lawyers to lead the way.
   ``There is a concern about how the regulations could be
interpreted,'' said Jeffrey Gabel, an immigration lawyer in New
York who has written about the new rules for Billboard magazine.
   The big change is in the two categories of visas the United
States gives to enter the country for temporary employment.
   In the past, most artists were given H-1 visas, handed out
without much question to film directors, singers and groups. The
new regulations make clear the H-1 is for aliens of ``distinguished
merit and ability'' and ``sustained achievement.''
   One-hit wonders aren't favored, while the winner of an Academy
Award or Nobel Prize, the INS suggests, should have no trouble
getting a H-1.
   Others are directed to the H-2, which requires an application
first to the Labor Department and then to the INS. That can take
from two to six months, which concerns entertainers who may not be
able to set tour plans more than a few weeks ahead of time.
   ``We're not getting into judging what they do,'' Rick Kenney, an
INS spokesman, said in an interview. ``They would have to show that
they're going to be providing a service that's good for the United
States.''
   It shouldn't hinder the Royal Danish Ballet from touring, but
the Philadelphia Orchestra might have to answer a lot of questions
if it wants to hire a third violinist from Great Britain.
   ``We just make judgments of who is and who is not just a regular
worker,'' said Kenney.
   Kitchen recalls that even before the new rules, British folk
rocker John Wesley Harding's performance at a Washington club
consisted only of an explanation to the crowd that he didn't have a
visa to perform.
   And he says a French rock group, ``Niagara,'' canceled one date
and got to play another only after France's cultural attache and
Sen. John Warner, R-Va., interceded with immigration officials who
were unimpressed with the group's French clippings and videos.
   ``I have yet to hear an explanation of why a band shouldn't be
brought over,'' said Seth Hurwitz, owner of Washington's 9:30 Club,
a small venue for international acts on the rise.
   ``This takes business away from American businessmen like me,
and it deprives the American public the chance to see someone they
want to see,'' said Hurwitz.
   The INS says the new rules mean promoters are going to have to
be better prepared _ no more booking garage bands from Liverpool on
Friday to play in New York next Wednesday.
   ``You have to be aware that it's going to take more information
and you're going to have to file longer in advance,'' said Joel
Peresman, an agent with The National Talent Group in New York.
   ``Unfortunately, this is a big change for everybody,'' said the
INS's Kenney. ``It's going to be a change in practice for a lot of
people and they're going to have to get used to it and stop taking
it personally.''
   As for Lang's comment that Dutch-born van Gogh _ who sold only
one painting before he died in 1890 _ Kenney says the French
official was exaggerating.
   ``That's just political,'' said Kenney. ``He probably wouldn't
get an H-1, but that doesn't mean he'd be denied entry. He would
apply for an H-2.''

   Ames Department Stores Inc., the giant
discount retailer that stumbled after purchasing the Zayre chain
two years ago, has filed for bankruptcy court protection, the
company said.
   The filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York late Wednesday
followed a tumultuous week in which Ames stock traded wildly amid
speculation that the chain would seek protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   ``The Chapter 11 filing will give our suppliers the assurance
they need to resume the steady flow of merchandise into our
stores,'' Peter B. Hollis, chief executive of the Rocky Hill,
Conn.-based chain, said Thursday.

   The United States and the Soviet Union reached
basic agreement on an economic pact that would normalize trade

   The agreement would clear the way for the Soviet Union to obtain

   The move comes one week after Citicorp reported a 56 percent

<HEAD>Wolf Says UAL Non-Contract Workers Getting Short Shrift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s 26,000 non-contract employees
are being treated unfairly by the three union groups leading the
charge for employee ownership of United Airlines' parent, says
Chairman Stephen Wolf.
   Wolf said he agreed with Daryl Thorogood, a United reservations
agent from San Francisco, who told the company's shareholders
Thursday that the exclusion of salaried and management employees
from buyout negotiations was ``rude, illegal and undemocratic.''
   Still, Wolf told several hundred shareholders at the annual
meeting that the proposed $201-a-share employee buyout is the best
deal possible under the circumstances.
   He also said UAL plans to announce soon a large order for
wide-bodied jetliners that may include the new Boeing 777.
   Ms. Thorogood read a letter she said had been sent to a number
of large banks and brokerage firms explaining the non-contract
workers' dissatisfaction with their treatment in the fashioning of
the $4.38 billion buyout proposal.
   At a news conference after the two-hour meeting, Wolf declined
to speculate on whether opposition by non-contract employees could
scuttle the deal, then added: ``I don't think you'd want them
against it.''
   ``I cannot possibly conceive of acquiring this corporation in
terms of 100 percent employee participation when 26,000 are being
disenfranchised,'' Wolf said.
   ``I think it's important to have them involved and have them
involved fairly.''
   The non-contract employees represent about a third of UAL's
71,500 workers. They include reservations and ticket agents,
professional and technical staff and management and supervisors,
excluding Wolf and other top officers.
   Under the deal approved April 6 by UAL's board, United's pilots
would own 37.9 percent of the company's stock, Machinists would own
35.7 percent, non-contract employees would get 14.3 percent and
United flight attendants 12 percent.
   The union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit
cuts totaling $2 billion over five years to help offset buyout
costs. Ms. Thorogood said the non-contract employees have had no
voice in deciding how much they would give up.
   Responding to other shareholder questions at what could be UAL's
last public stockholder meeting, Wolf said the employee bid is
``financeable'' and ``do-able'' but declined to speculate on
whether the deal will get done.
   He tried to reassure skeptical stockholders that the proposed
deal is better than the union group's initial bid, which was $11 a
share lower but included partial public ownership.
   Wolf also said selling all the company's stock to the employees
was better than the alternative: a threat by UAL's largest
shareholder, Coniston Partners, to oust the company's directors and
sell UAL to the union group at a price that Wolf said would have
been lower than the one negotiated by the board.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, ``didn't have
any regard for the other 88 percent of our shareholders,'' Wolf
said.
   ``Under the circumstances, we got the highest price we possibly
could have obtained for our shareholders and we spent a diligent
amount of time on doing that,'' he added.
   Investor skepticism about the ability of United's pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists to borrow the $4 billion they need to
complete their proposed buyout has contributed to a steady slide in
UAL's stock price. The shares closed Thursday at $152.50 on the New
York Stock Exchange, down from $163.50 on April 6, the day the
board accepted the offer.
   Wolf said UAL plans to announce, possibly by June 15, the
largest order in aviation history for wide-body aircraft. He said
the order will include some twin engine aircraft _ either Boeing
777s or Airbus A330s _ and also possibly some McDonnell Douglas
MD11s. Wolf would not elaborate on the number or dollar value of
the aircraft.
   At the meeting, shareholders re-elected 13 of UAL's 15 directors
to one-year terms. The two remaining directors had reached the
mandatory retirement age of 70 and were not replaced.

<HEAD>Big Discounter Files For Chapter 11</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAVOIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Suppliers who helped pushed troubled Ames
Department Stores Inc. into bankruptcy welcomed the discounter's
Chapter 11 filing, saying it would provide the security needed to
keep goods on store shelves.
   ``The air has been cleared as far as where the money will come
from,'' said Robert Luehrs, president of Chic Jeans.
   Ames filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code late Wednesday, largely because of its
inability to digest the Zayre chain it bought two years ago. The
purchase doubled Ames' size and turned it overnight from a
little-known New England-based chain to the nation's fourth-largest
discounter.
   The bankruptcy filing will allow Ames to reorganize its business
and pay suppliers under a new credit arrangement.
   In its filing, Ames listed a total of $1.44 billion in
liabilities and $1.66 billion in assets.
   It listed the company's biggest creditor as Societe Generale
Financial Corp., which is owed just over $14 million. Others listed
among the top 20 creditors include Thermos Co. at $5.2 million
owed; Rubbermaid Inc., $4.5 million; J.P. Stevens, $3.2 million,
and Fisher Price, $2.9 million.
   Ironically, it was skittishness on the part of Ames' suppliers
that pushed the company to file for protection from its creditors.
   Several suppliers began cutting off shipments to Ames last month
after the company announced it lost an estimated $228 million in
the fiscal year that ended Jan. 27. That news, coupled with an
apprehensive retail climate following the January bankruptcy filing
by Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailers, put suppliers into a near-panic.
   ``It's unprecedented in the history of retailing that suppliers
cut you off like that, but when you have Numero Uno go into
receivership ... it makes people very nervous,'' said Alan
Millstein, publisher of a monthly newsletter for retailers and
manufacturers.
   Ames' stock rebounded slightly after Thursday's announcement,
closing at $1.62{ a share on the New York Stock Exchange, up 12{
cents. Ames stock had been trading at nearly $30 a share in late
1987, but dipped to $9 a share in early January as Ames' troubles
mounted after a dismal Christmas season.
   Under the bankruptcy filing, Chemical Bank has agreed to lend
the Ames chain $250 million, with use of the money under control of
the bankruptcy court. The money will allow Ames to continue
operations and pay for merchandise shipments as it prepares it
reorganization plan.
   Suppliers said the new credit arrangement offers them a measure
of security they didn't have before the filing.
   The Gitano Group Inc., a sportswear supplier that is owed $5.3
million, said it plans to meet with Ames to talk about resuming
shipments now that they have some assurance of payment. Gitano
stopped shipments about four weeks ago.
   Analysts were unanimous in blaming Ames' downward spiral on its
$788 million acquisition of the 392-store Zayre chain in October
1988.
   ``This had to happen,'' said Howard Davidowitz, chairman of a
New York-based retail financial consulting firm. ``They took on a
company that had been sinking and the sinking just accelerated.
They couldn't save themselves.''
   The Zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions, heavy
advertising and discounted fashion items. Ames, in contrast, stocks
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions.
   Ames has since closed 90 Zayre stores and converted others to
the Ames name.
   Further, the company's attempts to quickly merge Ames and Zayre
computer systems resulted in some glitches that delayed payments to
suppliers, which led some suppliers to cut off the chain's credit.
   Douglas Ewing, Ames vice president for investor relations, said
a dismal Christmas season at Zayre stores after a disappointing
year pushed Ames over the edge.
   ``I think the fourth-quarter results, coupled with the sales
shortfall overall, did it for us,'' Ewing said.
   Ewing said Ames will continue normal operations while it works
out a payment plan with its creditors. He said the chain has no
immediate plan to cut staff or close additional stores, but would
not speculate on what will happen under the restructuring.
   Founded in 1958, Ames operates more than 600 stores in 20 states
and has about 55,000 employees.

<TEXT>
   Michael Milken's guilty plea may have settled
criminal charges, but his days as a target of civil litigation are
only beginning.
   Lawyers said Thursday about a dozen class-action lawsuits
already have been filed against the former junk bond financier, on
top of some 30 still pending over his relationship with ex-stock
speculator Ivan Boesky. More lawsuits are planned.
   The investors suing Milken claim a $400 million fund established
as part of his plea bargain to compensate defrauded investors won't
be enough.
   But it could be years before investors ever see a penny.
Attorneys first must sort through millions of documents to build
their cases, and Milken's defense lawyers promise to take the
claims to trial if necessary.
   Proceedings already have been delayed in the Boesky-related
lawsuits because prosecutors have prevented witnesses such as
Milken and Boesky from testifying while criminal cases were pending.
   Lawsuits already have been filed in New York, Phoenix, San Diego
and elsewhere alleging that Milken defrauded investors in
connection with hostile takeovers, the junk bond market and the
nation's troubled savings and loans.
   ``The plaintiffs bar is drawn to something like this like bees
to honey. We're not surprised,'' said Milken attorney Steven B.
Rosenfeld.
   ``Most of the litigation out there is totally, totally unrelated
not only to anything he pleaded guilty to but anything the
government ever investigated him for,'' he said.
   Milken, the former head of junk bonds for Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., pleaded guilty Tuesday to six tax and securities fraud
charges and agreed to pay $600 million to settle his four-year-long
battle with the government.
   Under the plea, Milken will put $400 million in a fund to be
administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission for
investors who can prove they were swindled by Milken's actions.
   The fund is not restricted to the limited transactions and
transgressions in the plea bargain, any civil claim against Milken
has a right to part of the money. In structuring the plea, Milken's
lawyers tried to limit his potential exposure to civil litigation.
   ``You could spend the next 10 years investigating Milken on
these things,'' said Daniel Berger of the Philadelphia law firm
Berger &amp; Montague, which is involved in Milken litigation. ``The
stuff he was indicted on was peripheral. That doesn't mean there
isn't other stuff.''
   Berger's firm doesn't believe the fund will be large enough. If
the money runs out, Milken is personally liable for civil claims.
Milken attorney Arthur Liman said in court he believes $400 million
will be plenty.
   One lawsuit filed last month on behalf of Unocal Corp.
shareholders accuses Milken, Drexel and about 100 other defendants
of a sweeping conspiracy to rig the financial markets in major
takeover deals of the 1980s.
   The sprawling claims _ Unocal was a takeover target in 1985 _
portray Milken as mastermind of a racketeering enterprise that
engaged in stock manipulation, insider trading, stock parking and
other felonious activity.
   It names takeover strategists including T. Boone Pickens Jr.,
Carl Icahn and Saul Steinberg; Boesky and his cronies; dozens of
former Drexel employees; other convicted Wall Street figures such
as stockbroker Boyd Jefferies and GAF Corp. executive James
Sherwin; even Milken's wife, Lori.
   The lawsuit seeks $2.3 billion in tripled damages under the
racketeering law. Said Rosenfeld: ``It's a bunch of nonsense.''
   Two shareholder lawsuits _ involving Columbia Savings &amp; Loan
Association and Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association _ recently added
Milken as a defendant. The thrifts, which lost hundreds of millions
of dollars, had large junk bond holdings acquired through Drexel.
   Another lawsuit filed on behalf of an estimated 10,000 junk bond
holders claims Milken rigged securities prices by controlling a
``daisy chain'' of buyers and sellers. Drexel lawyers claim that
suit is invalid because the main plaintiff lacks legal standing.
   ``A lot of things are in the works,'' said attorney R. Bruce
McNew of the Philadelphia firm Greenfield &amp; Chimicles, which
specializes in shareholder actions.
   Similar funds were set up in other Wall Street fraud cases _ $50
million for Boesky, about $20 million for investment bankers Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel, and $350 million for Drexel. But $150
million of the Drexel fund _ which also could be used for Milken
plaintiffs _ is tied up in bankruptcy court.
   The 30 lawsuits involving Boesky's dealings are consolidated
before U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack, who also will handle the
Milken civil litigation.
   No money yet has been paid out from the Boesky fund, which was
created more than three years ago.

<TEXT>
   The head of the nation's biggest cellular phone
company got the right number last year. He topped Business Week's
annual ranking of the nation's highest-paid chief executive
officers.
   Craig O. McCaw, 40, chairman and chief executive officer of
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., earned $53.9 million in salary,
bonuses and stock options last year, the magazine said Thursday in
a release from its May 7 issue. That put him on top by a wide
margin.
   The ranking differs considerably from one released earlier this
week by Forbes magazine. That list ranked Coca-Cola Co.'s chief
executive officer, Roberto C. Goizueta, as highest-paid, with $10.8
million in salary and other compensation last year. Business Week
placed Goizueta eighth, listing his compensation at $10.7 million.
   The Forbes list included only CEOs from the magazine's ranking
of the 50 largest U.S. companies, while Business Week surveyed 356
public companies in its 40th annual ranking. McCaw Cellular was not
among Forbes' 50 largest companies.
   Business Week said that among those it surveyed, the average
chief executive's salary and bonus rose just 3.4 percent in 1989,
to $1,172,533, the smallest increase since the 2 percent rise in
1970. According to Labor Department figures, the gain trailed the
increases for white-collar professionals, 4.9 percent, and factory
employees, 3.7 percent.
   McCaw, whose company has yet to turn a profit, earned only
$289,000 cash in salary but received $53.6 million from exercising
stock options that he and other McCaw executives received before
the company went public.
   Second on Business Week's list was Steven J. Ross, co-chairman
and CEO of Time Warner Inc., who received $34.2 million as co-head
of the media company. The bulk of his earnings _ $29.4 million _
was in long-term compensation such as stock options.
   In third place was Donald A. Pels, who received $22.8 million as
chairman and chief executive of Lin Broadcasting. McCaw Cellular
acquired Lin, a cellular phone, broadcasting and publishing
company, earlier this year.
   Jim P. Manzi, chairman, president and chief executive of Lotus
Development Corp., ranked fourth. Manzi received $16.4 million from
the computer software company.
   In fifth place was Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive of
athletic shoe maker Reebok International Ltd. Fireman was paid
$14.6 million, all in salary.
   Ronald K. Richey, chairman and chief executive of Torchmark
Corp., earned $12.7 million from the insurance and financial

   Worries about the quality of real estate and
takeover loans reached the nation's largest bank as Citicorp had
its credit rating lowered by a major rating agency.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. on Thursday downgraded about $30 billion
in credit of Citicorp.
   The move comes one week after Citicorp reported a 56 percent
drop in first-quarter earnings, in large part because of domestic
real estate loan difficulties in slumping regions that are expected
to worsen this year.
   Citicorp said it was dissapointed by the move.
   ``We are confident that the strength of Citicorp's core
businesses and well-positioned global franchises will continue to
provide excellent returns and growth,'' it said in a statement.
   Standard &amp; Poor's said it was lowering key credit ratings
because ``Citicorp's aggressive capital philosophy leaves it
diminished flexibility to face increased risks in the general
business environment.''
   S&amp;P said Citicorp has successfully resolved most of its problems
related to loans to developing countries, but is in a ``weakened
condition'' to deal with problems loans for real estate and
leveraged buyouts.
   S&amp;P also said Citicorp's capital levels are low, especially
considering the bank's relatively low reserves to guard against
failed loans.
   A number of major banking institutions have seen their debt
ratings downgraded recently by S&amp;P and Moody's Investors Service _
the two major credit rating agencies _ due to similar problems.
   But the downgrade _ to double-A-minus from double-A on the
bank's senior debt _ is noteworthy because of Citicorp's size,
prestige and credit rating, which is higher than many banking
institutions. Moody's last week said it was considering a downgrade
for Citicorp.
   A lower credit rating could make it more expensive for Citicorp
to borrow money by prompting investors to demand higher interest to
compensate for increased risk. The ratings have no effect on
customer deposits.
   Robert Albertson, a banking analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
criticized the downgrade as unnecessary.
   ``I think it's two rating agencies trying to be more bearish
than the regulators and I think it's a mistake,'' he said.
``Everybody's trying to sound tougher and be tougher in an
environment that's uncertain.''
   Albertson said he believes Citicorp in the past has accurately
forecast its losses and that if regulators had problems with the
bank's exposure to commercial real estate loans, ``they would have
said so by now.''
   Analysts said 7 percent of Citicorp's outstanding real estate
loans, excluding residential mortgages, were nonperforming in 1989,
about in line with other banks. But the amount of nonperforming
loans _ on which payments are not being made _ are expected to
increase.
   About 5 percent of Citicorp's highly leveraged transactions were
non-performing, fifth worst in a survey by ICBA Inc., a credit
rating agency. Citicorp has $7.8 billion in highly leveraged loans
outstanding, about twice as much as the next biggest bank.
   S&amp;P said Citicorp has withstood problems in its portfolio of
loans to developing countries. The bank charged $135 million
against earnings for loans to developing countries in the first
quarter, including $56 million of real estate loans, mostly in
North America.
   About half of a $548 million quarterly increase in loans not
paying interest reflected loans to highly leveraged companies
involved in takeovers or refinancings.
   Citicorp allocated $570 million in the first quarter for loan
losses, a $212 million increase over the previous year. Citicorp
had $1.3 billion in nonperforming U.S. real estate loans, up $119
million from a year earlier.
   S&amp;P said that Citicorp, despite the downgrade, has advantages
over other banks because of its diversification, strong consumer
businesses such as credit cards and varied forms of corporate
banking.

<HEAD>B-2 Builder Says Proposed Production Cut Will Hurt Subcontractors

   From suppliers to the aerospace giant
Northrop, the defense industry will feel the pinch of the
Pentagon's plan to slash production of the B-2 stealth bomber
nearly in half.
   ``It would mean that we would not recognize the buildup and
growth we had anticipated when we set out to do this,'' John
Kvasnosky, spokesman for Boeing Military Airplanes, said Thursday.
   He spoke after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney outlined to
Congress proposed cuts aimed at saving $34.8 billion through 1997.
The savings would be achieved partly by purchasing 75 B-2 stealth
bombers instead of 132 and delaying the start of production of
Advanced Tactical Fighters.
   With 10,000 people working on the B-2 project in the Seattle
area, the Boeing Co. is one of the largest contractors for the
stealth, built by Los Angeles-based Northrop.
   Northrop employs 12,000 people on the B-2 project, including
about 1,700 who work on assembling the radar-evading bomber in
Palmdale, Calif.
   Stealth bomber subcontractors and suppliers across the nation
employ 30,000 to 40,000 workers, said Tony Cantafio, a Northrop
spokesman.
   Production of five B-2s was proposed in the fiscal 1991 budget
at a cost of $5.5 billion. Under the new plan only two jets would
be built that year.
   ``The immediate effect may be felt by suppliers and
subcontractors around the country,'' said Cantafio.
   ``From an employment standpoint at Northrop, there won't be an
immediate effect.''
   Northrop still will need to hire several hundred more workers
for the Palmdale plant because of prior orders, Cantafio said.
However, Cheney's proposal would halve production in peak years to
12 from 24 aircraft.
   ``Obviously, in the long run we won't build up our employment to
the original schedule,'' Cantafio said.
   Just last Sunday the company ran full-page newspaper
advertisements for a B-2 job fair, using a photograph of the
ominous-looking flying wing and an appeal to many types of
aerospace workers to help ``make history.''
   Northrop has also been running television ads focusing on
employees talking about their work and featuring famed test pilot
Chuck Yeager.
   Building fewer stealth bombers would reduce the program's
projected cost from $75.4 billion to $61.1 billion but would raise
the cost of individual planes to more than $800 million, according
to Cheney.
   Northrop also is competing for a role in a new generation
aircraft known as the Advanced Tactical Fighter, which will replace
the Air Force's F-15.
   Cheney still wants 750 planes built but would push back
purchases two years, from 1994 to 1996.
   The Northrop spokesman characterized the impact of that change
as minimal because the aircraft is not yet in full-scale
development.

<HEAD>Executives of Marshall Field Announce Resignations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The top two executives of Marshall Field &amp; Co.
announced their resignations one day after Dayton Hudson Corp. said
it would consolidate Field's corporate headquarters with its own in
Minneapolis.
   Field Chairman Philip B. Miller and President Burnett W. Donoho
will resign when Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson's $1.04 billion
buyout is complete, Miller said Thursday.
   A week ago, Dayton Hudson beat out several suitors including a
group of managers led by Miller in a bidding war for Marshall
Field's.
   ``I was terribly disappointed that our bid wasn't successful,''
Miller said. ``We couldn't have reached that (price) level with our
partnership group. One of the ways (Dayton Hudson) got to their
number was their plan to consolidate, which we couldn't do.''
   Dayton Hudson expects to complete the deal within two months.
   BAT Industries PLC of Britain put the 24-store chain up for sale
last year as part of its restructuring to fight a takeover attempt
by corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Goldsmith dropped his
takeover effort Monday.
   In a letter Wednesday to Marshall Field's employees, Dayton
Hudson said it will offer jobs in Chicago and Minneapolis to some
central office employees. A Marshall Field regional organization,
focused on customer service and community involvement, will be
based in Chicago, the letter said.
   Of the 1,700 corporate employees, 350 to 400 are in the
merchandise group, including buyers and managers. Remaining jobs
are largely administrative and operational.
   Miller said he believes the consolidation will result in the
loss of about 1,450 jobs in Field's central organization.
   ``We will know by the time of the closing at the end of May or
the first few days of June how many people will be let go,'' said
Ann Barkelew, a spokeswoman for Dayton Hudson.
   She also said the company tried to work with Miller to see if it
had anything that interested him.
   ``To say anything more would not be appropriate because he has
made his decision,'' she said from Minneapolis, adding the company
has no idea who will replace Miller.
   Miller said he had discussions with Dayton Hudson about staying
with the company, but it became apparent to him it was time to move
on.
   Under the consolidation plan, ``the responsibilities are so
changed I don't feel I can be effective,'' he said during a news
conference.
   ``I don't have any plans right now. This has come about very
quickly.''
   Miller won wide credit for making Marshall Field's an attractive
target. He came to the chain in 1983 from Dallas-based
Neiman-Marcus, where he was president.
   His retailing history also included stints as merchandise
manager of Filene's in Boston, vice president and general manager
of Wallach's in New York, vice president and general merchandise
manager of Bloomingdales, and president of Lord &amp; Taylor, both of
New York.
   Donoho joined Field's in 1984, from Gimbel's Midwest _ at the
time a subsidiary of New York-based Gimbel's Department Stores _
where he was president and chief operating officer.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of brands of insect repellents,
including some types of OFF and Cutter's, are being withdrawn from
stores because a long-used ingredient to repel biting flies gave
tumors to lab rats and withered their ovaries.
   The ingredient's manufacturer, McLaughlin Gormley King Co. of
Minneapolis, gave the government test information disclosing the
problem and asked that its license to produce and sell it be
withdrawn, said Albert Heier, a spokesman for the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   ``The company has voluntarily canceled their registration on
this product and informed all the users,'' Heier said Thursday.
``They did the responsible thing.''
   Some 200 brands of insect repellent, including Deep Woods OFF
and Cutter's, use the ingredient
2,3,4,5-Bis(2,butylene)tetrahydro-2-furaldehyde as an additive to
repel flies that bite, Heier said.
   Two of the major users of the additive are S.C. Johnson and Son
Co. of Racine, Wis., which makes OFF, and Miles Co. of Chicago,
producer of Cutter's, Heier said.
   Both companies began notifying retailers a couple of weeks ago
to take the products containing the ingredient off their shelves.
In both cases, the withdrawal affects only a portion of the product
line, and does not include every insect repellent the companies
make.
   S.C. Johnson publicly announced its withdrawal of OFF earlier
this month, but Cutter's said nothing in public, although it did
notify retailers.
   About 25 percent of all insect repellents on the market use the
additive, known industrially as R-11 although that name does not
appear on the label of any consumer product. The labels, instead,
carry the long technical name, Heier said.
   The manufacturer's test results showed that the additive caused
``adverse reproductive effects, ovarian atrophy and oncogenicity,
or tumors,'' in laboratory rats and mice, the EPA spokesman said.
   ``These are the preliminary results; the studies aren't
completed,'' he said.
   The government has done no independent testing of the additive _
it requires pesticide manufacturers to conduct safety tests _ and
does not know how dangerous it may be. The ingredient has been used
for 35 years.
   ``We just don't have enough data to do a risk assessment,''
Heier said. ``We have no evidence that it hurt anybody.''
   In the case of Deep Woods OFF, the withdrawal affects about
150,000 cases of aerosol and pump containers and boxes of
towelettes, the company said in its public announcement nearly
three weeks ago.
   Cutter's, however, did not make a public announcement and
instead quietly informed retailers to take products from their
shelves, said spokeswoman Dionn Tron.
   ``Because there was no safety reason for doing this, it was
simply a precautionary measure on our part, there was no public
announcement,'' she said.
   The voluntary recall involved several products carrying the
Cutter's name, Ms. Tron said. Three Cutter's products did not
contain the ingredient in question: the tick repellent, the maximum
strength formula and the stick repellent.
   The recalled products are being replaced with new ones carrying
a yellow sticker saying it is a new formula, the spokeswoman said.
   Sixty-five other companies also produce repellents using R-11
under a variety of brand names.
   Among those are pet products, including some flea and tick
repellents marketed under the Adams or Mycodex brand names, said
Linda Kriesman, a spokeswoman for SmithKline Beecham Co.
   The products have been reformulated, and those new formulas
either have been approved already by the government or are awaiting
approval, she said.
   People with repellents containing R-11 who want to throw it away
should handle its disposal as they would any pesticide in
accordance with local ordinances, Heier said.
   Ms. Tron said people with Cutter's products containing R-11 can
contact the company, which will send a mailer to dispose of it.
   However, she said there was no need to get rid of the repellent.
   ``People who have the stuff can continue to use it,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A religious group has ended a nine-month
boycott of Clorox Co. products, citing a marked reduction in the
company's sponsorship of ``sex, violence, profanity and
anti-Christian stereotyping'' on television.
   But the boycott ``was a success in both dropping the sales of
Clorox products and in encouraging Clorox to enforce their
advertising policy,'' said Billy Melvin, executive director of
National Association of Evangelicals and chairman of the group
known as Christian Leaders for Responsible Television, or CLeaR-TV.
   Without disclosing whether the boycott cut into sales, Clorox
communications director Fred Reicher said, ``certainly we are
gratified the boycott has been lifted. The boycott made us aware
that implementation of our standards were flawed and we tightened
those.''
   CLeaR-TV describes itself as a coalition of 1,600 Christian
leaders with constituencies totaling 60 million people.
   The Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, a United Methodist preacher who
founded the group and serves as its executive director, said the
organization would continue a one-year boycott of products made by
the Mennen Co., also accused of sponsoring what the group sees as
objectionable television programming.
   When the boycotts were announced nine months ago, CLeaR-TV said
it had found the two manufacturers had placed advertisements on
offensive television programs from April 27 through May 24, a
``sweeps'' period during which the popularity of network
programming is gauged.
   Programs considered particularly offensive during that period _
both carrying advertising by the targeted companies _ included
NBC-TV's ``Miami Vice'' and ``Dream Street,'' Melvin had said.
   CLeaR-TV said it found a reduction of almost two-thirds in the
amount of sex, violence and profanity sponsored by Clorox last fall
as compared with last spring.
   The group said it had been approached by Clorox officials in
February noting that standards had been tightened and requesting
that the boycott be lifted.
   Clorox, whose products include bleach, Act laundry detergent,
Formula 409 cleaner and Lucite paint, ranked 66th among the leading
national advertising spenders at $148 million in 1988, according to
the trade publication Advertising Age.

<HEAD>Revco Agrees to Sell 221 Stores to Reliable Holdings Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Revco D.S., Inc.
said Friday it has agreed to sell 221 of its midwest drug stores to
Reliable Holdings Corp., of Fort Worth, Texas, for an undisclosed
price.
   The agreement marks the first step in a restructuring plan
announced in January designed to sell off 712 of Revco's 1,873
stores. Revco is currently operating under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code because of a debt-financed takeover that
soured.
   Included in the transaction, which will require bankruptcy court
approval, area all of Revco's stores in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri and in western Tennessee, the
Twinsburg company said in a release.
   Reliable Holdings Corp. was formed by Acadia Partners, L.P., and
the management of Reliable Drug Stores, Inc., a 112-store chain
based in Indianapolis.
   ``All our customers can continue to shop at Revco with full
confidence that their needs will be met,'' said Boake A. Sells,
Revco chairman and chief executive officer. ``We anticipate a very
smooth transition of these stores to Reliable.''
   The goal of Revco's restructuring plan is to concentrate on 10
eastern states, which account for 64 percent of the chain's sales.
The states include Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, West
Virginia andVirginia.
   Revco has annual sales of more than $2.7 billion.
   The company filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
July 1988, about a month after it failed to make an interest
payment on outstanding high-risk junk bonds used to finance its
$1.5 billion, management-led leveraged buyout.

   Stock prices declined slightly today as traders
studied the latest data on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dipped 1.81 to 2,674.77
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers held a narrow edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 421 up, 469 down and
512 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.86 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Before the trading day began the Commerce Department estimated
that the gross national product grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   An accompanying gauge of inflation showed prices in the
January-March period rising at a 7{-year high of 5.7 percent
annually.
   Analysts said those figures tended to reinforce fears on Wall
Street that the Federal Reserve might soon feel compelled to
tighten credit in its campaign to keep inflation in check.
   But interest rates declined a bit in the credit markets, where
yields on Treasury bonds climbed past the 9 percent level Thursday
for the first time in nearly a year. Brokers said many bond traders
had been braced for a bigger GNP increase than was actually
reported.
   Sun Microsystems rose 1&lsqb; to 24&lsqb; in the over-the-counter market.
Late Thursday the company reported earnings for its fiscal quarter
ended March 30 of 40 cents a share, up from 38 cents in the
comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .11 to 182.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .27 at 344.48.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 10.14 to
2,676.58.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 677 up, 764 down and
521 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 141.33 million
shares, up from 133.48 million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Company Offers to Buy Clunkers to Reduce Smog</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A giant oil company is offering $700 to
motorists who are looking to unload their old clunkers and would
like to help reduce smog in the Los Angeles area.
   ``We want to take the heaviest polluters off the road and hand
them over to a scrap yard, which will shred and recycle the
metal,'' Unocal Corp. Chairman Richard J. Stegemeier said Thursday.
   Unocal executives said pre-1971 vehicles pollute 15 to 30 times
more than 1990 models, although air quality officials don't
consider buy-back programs for old cars the most effective way to
reduce pollution.
   There are 410,000 pre-1971 cars registered in the Los Angeles
area. Unocal said it would pay $700 for the first 7,000 cars turned
in.
   ``We want to demonstrate ways of reducing smog that are
efficient and cost-effective,'' Stegemeier said. The program is
scheduled to begin June 1.
   Another voluntary program, to take effect in July, offers free
smog checks and emission control tune-ups for pre-1975 cars at
participating Unocal 76 service stations.
   Such tune-ups could remove 17 million pounds of carbon monoxide,
nitrogen oxides and reactive organic gases from the Los Angeles
basin, which has the worst air quality problem in the nation,
Unocal said.
   A buy-back program was suggested last year to regional smog
control officials by the Claremont Institute, a conservative
non-profit think tank.
   The institute suggested paying about $1,500 apiece to remove
850,000 pre-1980 vehicles from the region at a cost of $1.3
billion, said Lucas Morel, a research associate at the institute.
   While unusual in its approach, Unocal's announcement was hardly
unique.
   ``They're all becoming environmentally pro-active,'' said
Kenneth B. Funsten, an oil industry analyst.
   Funsten attributed the trend largely to Exxon Corp.'s handling
of the Alaska oil spill, which has hardened political opposition to
oil industry operations.
   Tom Eichhorn, a spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, said estimates of pollution eliminated by
vehicle buy-back programs are questionable because old cars are
less reliable and probably driven less than newer cars.
   In addition, agency officials estimate that most old cars will
stop running in a few years anyway, which doesn't really help the
region attain federal clean air standards by 2007, as required by
Congress.

   The U.S. economy, which ended last year on a
weak note, rebounded during the first quarter of 1990 at a
surprisingly healthy annual rate of 2.1 percent, the government
said today.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product _ the
total output of goods and services _ grew nearly twice as fast as
the feeble 1.1 percent gain from October through December.
   But the faster growth was accompanied by a worrisome pickup in
inflation as a price gauge tied to the GNP jumped at an annual rate
of 6.5 percent, up from the 4.5 percent rate for last year and the
biggest gain since a 7.7 percent advance in the fourth quarter of
1981.
   J. Antonio Villamil, Commerce Department chief economist, said
the weather contributed to both the economy's strength and the
price hike and that inflation would moderate over the rest of the
year.
   Excluding the weather factor and a federal pay raise that went
into effect in January, inflation rose only 5.2 percent, he said.
   ``Despite the larger price rise, the first quarter still had
encouraging developments _ signs of the economy's resilience,'' he
told a news conference, noting that the 2.1 percent GNP growth was
close to the administration's forecast last January of 2.2 percent.
   While the Bush administration is counting on a growing economy
this year to help close the federal budget gap, many private
analysts are pessimistic about whether the first-quarter rate can
be sustained.
   These analysts believe the first-quarter GNP strength resulted
from special, one-time factors and many fear the Federal Reserve
could slow it further by increasing interest rates to curb
inflation.
   In fact, for the entire year, the consensus forecast is for a
meager GNP growth of just 1.9 percent, far below the 3 percent
increase of 1989 and a half-percentage point below the
administration's 2.4 percent forecast.
   Still, the first quarter performance was a far cry from most
forecasts when the year began.
   At that time, many economists forecast GNP growth in the first
quarter would be little improved from the fourth quarter rate, the
slowest in three years. Some even said the economic recovery, now
in its eighth year, was in danger of toppling into a recession.
   The unexpected strength in the first quarter was credited in
part to the unusually warm weather during the quarter, which
boosted building construction and helped to hold down America's
demand for foreign oil.
   But the weather also was partly responsible for the jump in
inflation.
   December was the fourth coldest on record, destroying fruits and
vegetables and driving up prices in the following months. The
frigid temperatures also resulted in higher fuel costs as dealers
sought to replenish their stocks.
   The GNP's 2.1 percent advance was the fastest since a 3.0
percent gain in the third quarter last year. The various changes
left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, growing at an annual
rate of $4.196 trillion in the

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
aggressive pre-weekend profit-taking in the soybean market.
   A powerful soybean rally on Thursday reflected concerns about
the continuing slow pace of the Brazilian soybean harvest and
strong world demand for soybean meal, analysts said.
   Forecasts for warmer- and drier-than-normal weather in the
Midwest next week also helped fuel Thursday's run-up in soybeans as
well as in grains.
   Corn and wheat futures were off slightly this morning, in
sympathy with the soybean market and in reaction to continued good

   The Senate Agriculture Committee voted today
to set a national standard for organically grown food.
   The regulations requiring farmers to follow specific methods in
order to label their products ``organically produced'' will be part
of the 1990 farm bill that the full Senate will vote on later this
year.
   ``This legislation sets one tough national standard for organic
foods,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the
agriculture committee.
   He said the label will mean that the food has been grown without
substances known to be harmful to human health or to cause
environmental pollution.
   ``A March 1990 Harris poll showed for the second year in a row
that more than four out of five Americans want organic fruits and
vegetables and over half are willing to pay more for them,'' he
said. ``Consumers who want organic food should get what they pay
for.''
   Leahy said current farm programs encourage chemical-intensive
agriculture by discouraging crop rotation and limiting diversity.
   ``This legislation will help American farmers learn to use fewer
synthetic pesticides and fertilizers,'' he said.
   The bill that will be incorporated into legislation setting
federal farm policies for the next five years was passed
unanimously by the Senate committee.
   The bill requires:
   _ Minimum standards for the label ``organically produced.''
   _ Periodic on-site inspections and residue testing.
   _ An accreditation program for state officials and private
individuals who certify farms and food-handling operations.
   _ A second label indicating the state of origin of the product.
   _ Establishment of a national organic promotion advisory
committee to gain insight and advice from the organic farming
sector of the agriculture industry to help develop legislation on
organic promotion, research and education.
   The House, which is also working on the 1990 farm bill, has not
passed any similar legislation yet.

   Earnings for the nation's Big Three automakers
are expected to take another double-digit dive, reflecting
production slashes and economic problems in South America, analysts
say.
   First-quarter profits for General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co.
and Chrysler Corp. are expected to be less than a third of last
year's levels, auto analysts said Thursday. The companies will
report their quarterly earnings next week.
   ``The pricing environment was extremely weak and there wasn't a
lot of production in the first quarter,'' said John Kirnan of
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. of New York.
   During the January-March period this year, automakers cut
production and laid on incentives in an effort to deflate
ballooning new-car inventories. The inventories were brought back
to more manageable levels, which was good for the companies, but
the moves apparently clobbered first-quarter earnings.
   A spot check of analysts showed forecasts that GM's quarterly
earnings would be down about 70 percent from the $1.55 billion
earned during the first three months of last year, when GM had its
best quarter since the second quarter of 1984.
   Ford's earnings should be down about 75 percent from the $1.64
billion the company earned in last year's period. Chrysler Corp.
may show a marginal profit, if any, compared with the $351 million
in profits it posted last year, the analysts said.
   ``The earnings are going to be almost a yawn,'' Kirnan said.
``People have been bracing for the weakened earnings report. The
bigger question is when we are going to get the turn.''
   Auto company executives and other analysts have predicted that
the first half of the year would be tough and that things would
pick up in the second half.
   ``In the second quarter, earnings will still be below last year,
but the comparisons won't be as bad as the first quarter,'' said
David Healy of Barclays-BZW of New York.
   A second-half rebound may be delayed, though, Kirnan said.
   ``The and truck) sales numbers have certainly gotten back into a
sluggish territory and with interest rates continuing to escalate,
it may choke off a major turn in second-quarter and second-half
earnings of these companies,'' he said.
   Chrysler, which has relied heavily on incentives to sell its
cars and trucks, had an aggressive incentive program for its
popular minivans during January that pumped up sales. But incentive
costs come directly out of profits, and the No. 3 automaker doesn't
have overseas operations to prop up any sag in North American
operations.
   During the past year or so, GM and Ford relied on their overseas
businesses, especially in Europe and South America, to help
maintain profit levels for the entire corporation. That reliance
may be ending.
   ``A lot of people got surprised by the extent of the damage in
Brazil,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors Service
Inc. in New York. ``Everything is at a standstill in Brazil.''
   In March, the new Brazilian government froze 80 percent of the
nation's savings, sharply curtailing economic activity. On March
26, Ford and the West German automaker Volkswagen AG shut down
production at Autolatina joint venture in Brazil and put 2,800
employees on a paid leave.
   Ford spokesman Rex Greenslade said Thursday those workers would
be recalled next Wednesday.
   Ford, in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said if current conditions continued in Brazil there
was a potential for a substantial negative effect on the company's
earnings.
   Greenslade declined to comment on whether the employee recall
meant that Ford has more confidence in the Brazilian economic
situation.

<HEAD>Wang Posts Third-Quarter Loss And Drop In Revenue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. said Friday it lost $146.6
million in its most recent quarter, in part due to a number of
significant one-time charges, including one related to the sale of
its international lease-financing operations.
   The loss, which came to 89 cents a share, was double the loss of
the same period a year earlier, when Wang reported a deficit of
$63.7 million, or 39 cents a share.
   The office computer company said its revenue dropped to $583.1
million in the three months ended March 31, which is Wang's third
fiscal quarter, from $721.4 million for the same quarter of 1989.
   ``A significant portion of our third-quarter loss is the direct
result of one-time charges associated with our highly successful
program to sell non-strategic assets and the ongoing fundamental
reordering of Wang's business operations,'' Richard W. Miller,
Wang's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
   Miller said the Lowell-based company's debt-reduction plan would
have a positive effect in the future by eliminating about $55
million in annual interest payments, which accounted for $15.9
million of Wang's fiscal third-quarter loss.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Wang reported a
net loss of $219.2 million, or $1.33 a share, compared with a loss
of $49.6 million, or 33 cents a share, for the same period a year
earlier.
   ``Since August 1989, our aggressive actions to sell
non-strategic assets and our consolidation programs have enabled
Wang Laboratories to cut operating expenses by more than $300
million annually,'' Miller said.
   ``With future asset sales anticipated, Wang hopes to eliminate
completely its bank-group debt and associated future interest
payments, while strengthening its cash reserves.''
   Wang said Friday it completed the sale of its international
lease-financing operations to GE Capital Corp., a division of
General Electric Co., for about $240 million. The company said it
expected to record a book loss of about $19 million on the sale,
which was recorded in Wang's third-quarter results.
   Officials said $215 of the proceeds from the sale will be used
to reduce the company's bank debt to about $90 million. The
remaining $25 million will be used to increase the company's cash
reserves, officials said.
   Wang's bank debt had totaled about $575 million last August.

   General Electric Co. said Friday it will
eliminate about 4,200 hourly and salaried jobs over the next two
years at five GE Aerospace locations.
   The cuts are part of GE's efforts to reorganize its aerospace
defense businesses so the company can remain successful despite a
shrinking market and increased competition.
   GE says it will take advantage of projected attrition and
retirements of about 2,000 employees to reduce significantly the
number of employess actually laid off.
   The reductions are scheduled to take place at plants in
Binghamton, Syracuse and Utica, N.Y. and Camden and Moorestown, N.J.
   ``We are taking decisive actions now to enable our business to
meet its future commitments to customers and ensure that GE
Aerospace will be a vital, industry-leading business for many years
to come,'' said Jon Rittenhouse, senior vice president for GE
Aerospace.
   ``We're entering a decade that will provide a difficult
challenge for defense companies,'' he said. ``The world's changing
political outlook will result in a smaller, more intensely
competitive worldwide defense market.''
   Where layoffs are necessary, GE will offer financial assistance
based on length of service and medical and life insurance coverage
for up to one year from the date of layoff. The company also will
offer job-finding assistance.
   The cuts affect about 15 percent of the company's 6,000
employees at three Syracuse-area plants. They are the first
significant local layoffs since the company shut down its picture
tube production operation in November 1986.
   GE, Syracuse's largest employer, will cut 200 salaried jobs by
the end of 1990, said GE spokeswoman Connie Grasso. Another 420
hourly jobs and 250 salaried will be eliminated over the next two
years.
   Layoffs at the three local sites in the towns of Geddes, DeWitt
and Salina will begin as early as June 1.
   In 1989, GE Aerospace cut 4,000 jobs, decreasing its work force
from 44,000 to 40,000 through layoffs, business cutbacks, attrition
and retirement. The company plans a similar reduction this year and
a smaller one in 1991.

   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. on Friday
reported a 3 percent increase in net income in the first quarter,
with increases in most of its divisions but sluggish results from
its auto and homeowner lines.
   The insurance company recorded net income of $180 million, or
$1.61 a share, in the latest three months, up from $174 million, or
$1.52 a share, in the same 1989 period.
   Total revenues were $4.77 billion, up 4 percent from $4.57
billion in the same period in 1989.
   ``We had significantly better group insurance and pension
results,'' said Aetna Chairman James T. Lynn. ``However, our
personal auto insurance business continues to suffer from high loss
costs and inadequate prices.''
   The auto-homeowners' line earned $1 million in the quarter, on
premiums of $677.3 million, compared to a $4 million loss in the
1989 period on premiums of $680.3 million.
   Aetna had much stronger results in its employee benefits
division, which recorded $77 million in earnings compared to $42
million in the 1989 period. Premiums totaled $1.1 billion, up from
$1.04 billion in the first quarter last year.
   The personal financial security division had $20 million in

<HEAD>Retirement Prospects Not Rosy for Service Sector Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An increasing number of service workers
won't have adequate retirement income promised by the 1965 Older
Americans Act, a Florida State University professor reported Friday.
   A study co-written by associate sociology professor Melissa A.
Hardy said service workers are less likely to retire, and more
likely to leave the work force through disability or death, than
those in most other career fields.
   ``The study suggests that retirement among service workers is an
option that is financially unavailable or unattractive,'' Hardy
said. ``It indicates that, as the service sector grows, fewer
Americans will be able to retire early enough to enjoy their
retirement years.''
   Mark D. Hayward, a professor of sociology at the University of
Southern California, and William R. Grady, a researcher at Battelle
Memorial Institute in Seattle, co-wrote the study.
   Service jobs include such occupations as waitress, porter,
bartender, janitor, cab driver and kitchen worker.
   ``Clearly, workers with different occupational histories do not
have equal access to adequate retirement income promised by the
Older Americans Act because inequalities are built into the
system,'' Hardy said.
   The 25-year-old law, a major piece of President Lyndon Johnson's
``Great Society'' program, says Americans should have ``equal
opportunity to the full and free enjoyment of ... retirement in
health, honor and dignity.''
   But the study found only 67 percent of service workers
nationwide leave the job for conventional retirement. The rate was
higher for managers, craftsmen, factory workers, clerical help,
farm laborers and general laborers.
   ``One reason fewer service workers retire is because pension
systems tend not to be in place in service industries as they have
traditionally been in manufacturing industries,'' Hardy said. ``And
they're often low-wage jobs, so the probability of service workers
accumulating savings and investments is much reduced as well.''
   The result is that more service workers stay on the job until
they become disabled or die compared to other occupations, she
said. According to the study, which tracked 2,816 men from age 55
through retirement, 9 percent of all service workers leave work
because of disability.
   Only farmers at 10 percent leave at a higher rate, the study
noted. And only professionals are more likely to die on the job
than service workers. Among professionals, 15 percent died while
still working, as opposed to 13 percent of service workers.
   Professionals traditionally stay on the job longer than others
because they enjoy the challenge, have more control over their work
and sometimes find it harder to maintain their lifestyles on
pensions, she said. About 11 percent of the service workers were
still employed at the end of the study period.

   An accompanying gauge of inflation showed prices in the
January-March period rising at a 7{-year high of 5.7 percent
annually.
   Analysts said those figures tended to reinforce fears on Wall
Street that the Federal Reserve might soon feel compelled to
tighten credit in its campaign to keep inflation in check.
   Interest rates were mixed in the credit markets, where yields on
Treasury bonds climbed past the 9 percent level Thursday for the

<HEAD>Lockheed Announces 2,750 Layoffs Day After Douglas Announces 3,000
Job Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Corp. said today it would lay
off 2,750 workers in its plane-building division, including about
2,000 of them in Southern California.
   The job cuts, which had been expected, were the second big round
of aerospace layoffs in as many days to hit the region. McDonnell
Douglas Corp. said Wednesday it will eliminate 3,000 jobs at its
Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit this summer to reduce the
costs of jet aircraft production at the money-losing division.
   In yet another indication of hard times for the defense
industry, General Electric Co. said today it will eliminate about
4,200 jobs over the next two years at GE Aerospace locations in New
York and New Jersey. The cuts are part of efforts to make GM's
aerospace defense businesses leaner so the company can compete
despite a shrinking market and increased competition.
   James Ragsdale, a spokesman for Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems
Co. in Burbank, said the other 750 employees who will lose their
jobs are based in Marietta, Ga., where Lockheed had built the huge
C-5 cargo plane.
   The C-5 is just one of four Lockheed military planes whose
production had ended recently or is to end soon. The others are the
P-3 sub-hunter, the TR-1 high-altitude reconnaissance plane, and
the F117A stealth fighter.
   ``It is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft
production project that will begin before the mid-1990s,'' Ken
Cannestra, the president of the aeronautics unit, said in a
statement.
   Lockheed, the nation's sixth-biggest military contractor, saw
its profits fall from $624 million in 1988 to just $2 million last
year. One big reason was that the company underestimated by
hundreds of millions of dollars the costs of developing a new
warplane, the P-7, a replacement for the P-3.
   As of April 1, Lockheed's aeronautical division had 10,124
workers in Georgia and 12,752 in Southern California. Employment in
the division peaked in mid-1988. About 9,000 workers already had
been laid off.
   Douglas Aircraft hasn't managed any profit recently. In its
first-quarter report last week, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas
said the quarterly operating loss at Douglas was $84 million.
   Douglas is home to the MD-80 jetliner and where the MD-11
jetliner and C-17 cargo plane are being developed. Employment rose
from about 15,000 in 1984 to 50,000 as orders for the twin-engine
MD-80 surged and the other planes were brought along. But the
losses forced the elimination of 3,000 of those jobs, about 6
percent, the company said.
   ``The bottom line is, we've got to reduce costs because the
performance has not been up to expectations,'' said spokesman John
Thom.
   Thom said the cuts had been under discussion for some time and
were not a reaction to Thursday's proposal by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney to buy 120 of the C-17 long-range transport planes
instead of the 210 originally planned. Cheney projects that such
cuts would save $11.9 billion over the life of the program.

   Dave Lyons remembers the glory days in
Odessa, Texas, when the oil boom brought roustabouts and rig
workers to west Texas and the circulation of his newspaper, The
Odessa American, shot skyward.
   ``They were blue-collar workers. But they were sophisticated,''
he said. ``They were world traveled. Some of them had served
overseas in Saudi Arabia or Libya.''
   They were people who read newspapers.
   Now, many of the oil people are gone, and, like other Texas
papers, The Odessa American is struggling back from a precipitous
tumble in readership and advertising.
   Texas papers are not alone. Odessa's story was typical of tales
of woe told this week at the American Newspaper Publishers
Association's 104th convention, a gathering that annually takes the
pulse of the U.S. newspaper industry.
   This year, the pulse was slower than ever and the prognosis for
the patient's future was anybody's guess. Was the problem a
recurring depression or something more life threatening? A
transfusion of advertising would help, all agreed. A healthier
readership was advised.
   The Odessa American, a member of the Freedom Newspapers group
with a circulation of 38,000, is bouncing back, Lyons said, due to
aggressive changes. Those include conversion from an afternoon to a
morning paper and a heavy focus on local sports to attract
notoriously indifferent younger readers.
   ``Since 1986, we've lost about 20 percent (of circulation),''
Lyons said. ``But that was because we lost population. Our home
county had a population of 144,000 before the oil bust. Now the
population is 116,000. ...
   ``These days, every time I see an obituary for a person over 50,
I think, oh, no, there goes another subscriber,'' Lyons said.
   Advertising, the life blood of newspapers, has been draining
away at an alarming rate all over the country. In the worst slump
since the 1970s, advertising was down 2.8 percent in 1989 from a
year earlier, according to Leading National Advertisers, a firm
that tracks newspaper ad revenue.
   In the first quarter of 1990, even the normally robust Times
Mirror Co. reported a 33 percent fall in net income. The drop was
blamed on a soft ad market, particularly for the company's East
Coast newspapers.
   Times Mirror's flagship paper, the Los Angeles Times, announced
a dramatic circulation climb of 9.5 percent to an all-time high of
1,225,189 daily, buoyed by readers from the Los Angeles Herald
Examiner, which folded in November. But the Times' advertising
revenue was down about 2 percent.
   Ironically, the financial news that fills newspaper business
pages has had a boomerang effect, striking the messengers in the
pocketbook. Acquisitions, mergers, store closures and a falling
real estate market mean decreased advertising.
   Classified pages, the newspaper's financial backbone, shrank as
ads for automobiles, real estate and help wanted declined.
   ``The question is whether it's cyclical or not,'' said John J.
Curley, chairman of Gannett Co., which owns more dailies than any
other group. ``We honestly don't know.''
   In its first-quarter report, issued last week, Gannett profits
rose by only the narrowest of margins, from $74.9 million a year
ago to $75 million this year.
   Curley sees the newspaper recession as regional rather than
nationwide. He linked it to last winter's bankruptcy protection
filing by the Campeau Corp., the Toronto-based conglomerate that
controlled some of this country's best-known retail stores,
including Bloomingdale's, Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and Abraham &amp;
Straus.
   ``West is best,'' Curley said, noting that the Southwest,
recovering from the oil crisis, is doing well. ``Northwest is
second-best. Midwest is more down than out. Southeast is mostly
down _ that's retail related. Northeast is worst, with automotive
ads a big factor.''
   Craig Standen, president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, an
arm of ANPA, stressed that newspapers aren't the only media-related
companies suffering.
   ``The whole media market, the advertising business, is not going
as fast as it has in the past,'' he said. ``Yes, it's a problem for
newspapers. But I don't think it means something is structurally
wrong with newspapers.''
   Declining readership was the other major problem troubling
publishers. It was the topic of panel discussions, speeches and
workshops. Poor education was denounced. More literacy was demanded.
   A note of hope was sounded by Steven L. Isenberg, associate
publisher of Newsday, who said that in spite of a general economic
downturn, New York remains a bastion of newspaper readers.
   ``In New York City, the number of people who read two or more
papers a day is remarkable,'' he said, adding, ``Opinion is the
mother's milk of New York life. We give them columnists with
different opinions and views, and they come back with a real
signature of daily life.''
   Isenberg warned that while newspapers are besieged with
financial woes, they shouldn't forget their underlying purpose.
``Newspapers are part of helping us to be intelligent citizens,''
he said.
   ``We are an engine of democracy and we have a responsibility to
the whole community,'' said C. Shelby Coffey III, editor and
executive vice president of the Los Angeles Times.
   ``I think newspapers are central to the survival of a free
society,'' said John E. Cox, Jr., president of the Foundation for
American Communications.
   Their statements could be taken as an echo of the enthusiastic
standing ovation the 1,600 ANPA members gave to two special guests
_ the publishers of a Bogota, Colombia, newspaper that fought that
country's drug lords and managed to publish after its plant was
bombed. No mention was made of the paper's advertising and
circulation numbers.

<HEAD>Revco Agrees to Sell 221 Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revco D.S. Inc. said Friday it agreed to
sell 221 of its 1,873 stores to Reliable Holdings Corp. of Fort
Worth, Texas, as part of its restructuring under bankruptcy court
protection.
   Revco, one of the largest drugstore chains in the country with a
work force of 26,800 people, announced Jan. 26 that it planned to
sell 712 of its stores.
   The price of the deal with Reliable Holdings was not disclosed.
   Weighed down by debt incurred in a takeover, the chain had filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law in July 1988. Its restructuring involves selling
stores in the western United States and emphasizing its operations
in the East, where it gets most of its sales.
   Revco will sell to Reliable Holdings all its stores in western
Tennessee and in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan and Missouri, Revco said.
   Reliable Holdings Corp. was formed by Acadia Partners LP, and
the management of Reliable Drug Stores Inc., a 112-store chain
based in Indianapolis.
   ``We anticipate a very smooth transition of these stores to
Reliable,'' said Boake A. Sells, Revco chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Friday's announcement is the first involving buyers for the
stores. Any sales are subject to bankruptcy court approval.
   Revco officials in January said they hoped that those working in
stores targeted for sale would be hired by eventual buyers.
   The company said its business in 10 Eastern states accounts for
64 percent of the chain's sales.
   The states are Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, West
Virginia and Virginia.
   Other Revco stores are in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Texas.
   Revco has annual sales of more than $2.7 billion.
   The company filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
July 1988, after it failed to make an interest payment on
outstanding ``junk bonds'' used to finance its $1.5 billion,
management-led leveraged buyout the previous year.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer of the company borrows the
purchase money with the idea of repaying it through asset sales and
earnings.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge, Grains Close Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed sharply higher
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late flurry of
speculative buying underpinned by strong demand and slow shipments
from Brazil.
   Grain futures ended mixed with new-crop wheat prices rising
strongly.
   Analysts were somewhat bewildered by the performance of the
soybean market, which had opened lower after a powerful advance on
Thursday.
   Mickey Luth, grains analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
said underlying support was provided by strong world demand for
soybean meal and by the slow pace of soybean and soymeal exports
from South America due to harvest delays and sweeping economic
reforms in Brazil.
   But analysts said there had been no change Friday in supply and
demand factors that might account for the surge in the soybean
market. Friday's rally was led by speculative funds, they said.
   The soybean market also may be reflecting speculation that the
past week's unusually warm, dry Midwestern weather could extend
into the growing season, analysts said. But they added that it is
too early in the growing season to worry about a repeat of the 1988
drought.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 5} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.70 a bushel; corn was 1

   Energy futures prices finished mixed Friday in a
session shortened by a computer glitch that disrupted trading on
five futures and options markets.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, gained 7
cents to settle at $18.54 a 42-gallon barrel after losing 19 cents
on Thursday. Subsequent contract months posted somewhat stronger
gains.
   Home heating oil for May delivery rose 0.67 cent to 53.74 cents
a gallon matching Thursday's gain. Other contract months also
advanced.
   But the May contract for unleaded regular gasoline lost 0.39
cent on top of a 1.26-cent decline Thursday to settle at 60.95
cents a gallon. Subsequent months also lost ground.
   And natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.550 per million
British thermal units, down from $1.558 on Thursday.
   Traded halted at 11:20 a.m. EDT after computer screens when
blank, leaving traders unable to monitor price quotes. Activity
came to a standstill in the nation's major oil and metals trading
pits.
   ``It was a surprisingly short day,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director at Elders Futures Inc.
   The exchanges gave traders about five minutes to close out their
positions before shutting down officially at 2 p.m. EDT.
   ``We may have seen more activity if we had had a full day,''
Beutel said.
   But he noted that trading often subsides ahead of an OPEC
meeting. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' price
monitoring committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to to discuss
ways of holding down the cartel's production and stopping oil
prices from falling.

<HEAD>Governor Signs Pennsylvania Anti-Takeover Law; Two Suits Filed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Robert P. Casey Friday signed the
nation's toughest anti-takeover law, saying it would discourage
corporate raiders from stripping jobs and economic vitality from
Pennsylvania.
   Within hours, the law was challenged by two suits filed in
federal court that claimed unconstitutional infringment on
shareholder and investor rights.
   Analysts expect the law, which took effect immediately, will
create ripples in boardrooms and legislatures throughout the nation.
   For the first time in any state, raiders will be forced to
surrender short-term profits from thwarted takeover attempts. The
law also restricts the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor
contracts when corporations change hands.
   Casey said the buyout spree of the past decade had left a wake
of broken dreams for both workers and companies. The law, he said,
would protect their interests in the face of greed-driven
profiteers.
   ``We're interested in long-term, stable economic growth. We're
not interested in corporate raiders that see short-term profits for
narrow interests,'' Casey said.
   Hostile takeovers have cost Pennsylvania thousands of jobs and
such corporate mainstays as Gulf Oil Co., which closed its
headquarters in Pittsburgh after it was merged with Chevron Corp.
The AFL-CIO estimates 90,000 jobs were lost nationwide over the
last decade because of mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts.
   Casey signed the bill at city council chambers blocks from the
corporate headquarters of Armstrong World Industries Inc., the
floor covering manufacturer that the legislation was first drafted
to protect.
   Its enactment comes three days before Armstrong's annual
stockholder meeting, where the Belzberg family of Canada plans to
wage a proxy fight to place four of its representatives on the
company's board.
   A suit filed on behalf of the Belzbergs in U.S. District Court
in Philadelphia alleges the law conflicts with federal legislation
and violates the First and Fifth amendments of the Constitution.
   ``The federal statutory scheme is designed to create a level
playing field for management and those who would oppose management.
This new legislation dramatically tilts the playing field in favor
of management,'' said Lawrence Fox, an attorney who filed the suit
on behalf of First City Financial Corp. and other Belzberg-owned
entities.
   The second suit was filed by Richard Greenfield, a Montgomery
County attorney, on behalf of a New York resident and an Arizona
resident who own stock in Pennsylvania companies.
   ``The shareholders are concerned with the provision of the new
law that effectively takes away the very fundamental rights they've
traditionally had. We don't think, for that reason, that the law is
constitutional,'' Greenfield said.
   The central provision in the law requires raiders, after a
failed buyout or proxy fight, to forfeit any profit made from the
sale of the target company's stock for 18 months. Shareholders who
initiate proxy fights could avoid sanctions in most cases,
providing they don't intend to take control of the corporation.
   The law would also allow management to give first consideration
to employees, customers, suppliers or the community, rather than
shareholders, when weighing takeover bids. Another provision would
deny raiders voting rights in a corporation until they are restored
by other shareholders.
   If corporate ownership changes hands, labor contracts would have
to be honored and severance paid to laid-off workers.
   Up to 90 days after the law takes effect, corporations would be
able to exempt themselves from the legislation. The chairman of PNC
Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh has said he plans to recommend to
directors that the company exempt itself. PNC is the parent company
of Pittsburgh National Bank and is the nation's 14th-largest bank
holding company.
   The legislation had been criticized by the chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, among others. Critics contend
the bill would insulate bad management from shareholders and
ultimately depress stock prices for state companies.
   Some also claim the law is too late because the pace of hostile
takeovers slowed considerably and the junk bond market is in
shambles.
   But supporters assert the law will give companies breathing room
from the threat of takeovers, freeing them to concentrate on growth
and long-range planning.
   ``I clearly think that it's going to mean stabilization and
preservation of Pennsylvania corporations, jobs and payroll,'' said
Clifford Jones, president of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business
and Industry, which drafted the bill.

   Stock prices posted a broad loss today as
traders studied the latest data on economic growth.
   Before the trading day began the Commerce Department estimated
that the gross national product grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   An accompanying gauge of inflation showed prices in the
January-March period rising at a 7{-year high of 5.7 percent
annually.
   Analysts said those figures tended to reinforce fears on Wall
Street that the Federal Reserve might soon feel compelled to
tighten credit in its campaign to keep inflation in check.
   Interest rates were mixed in the credit markets, where yields on
Treasury bonds climbed past the 9 percent level Thursday for the
first time in nearly a year. Brokers said some bond traders were
relieved that the GNP increase wasn't any bigger than it turned out
to be.

   National Steel Corp. said Friday it lost $4.2
million in the first quarter in contrast to a profit of $9.8
million a year earlier, and cited reduced demand in the markets it
serves.
   Sales decreased 7 percent to $611.7 million from $654.5 million
in the same quarter of 1989, the company said.
   The 1989 first-quarter results included an extraordinary credit
of $2.6 million, which represents the tax benefit of operating loss
carryforwards not previously recognized, the company said.
   National Steel Chairman Howard M. Love attributed the
first-quarter loss largely to sluggishness in most markets, in
particular automotive.
   ``Because of the softness in demand, we experienced both a
decline in prices and an unfavorable impact on our product mix,''
he said.
   Also contributing to the loss were higher raw material prices,
especially zinc and scrap, and higher operating costs, Love said.
   ``Despite the first quarter decline, there is continually rising
long-term market demand for value-added goods such as galvanized
and tin-mill products,'' he said.

   The five New York futures and options markets
shut down early on Friday after a communications glitch prevented
thousands of traders, brokers and investors from receiving price
data.
   Action in the nation's major oil and metals trading pits came to
a standstill when the exchanges discovered that no price quotes
were leaving the building.
   Exchanges employees and participants said it was the first time
in recent memory that the markets were closed because of a
technical problem. Traders reported no panic and an orderly
shutdown. Some players took an early weekend. Trading was halted at
11:20 a.m. at the Commodity Exchange, the nation's main metals
market; the New York Mercantile Exchange, the main oil trading
market; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the Cotton Exchange;
and the New York Futures Exchange.
   ``It's a Friday afternoon and it's a gorgeous day outside. If it
didn't look like Comex was going to open up, it was, `I'm going to
get a tee time or put my boat in the water,''' said Scott Hinton, a
metals broker with Elders Futures Inc.
   The problem involved communication lines inside the exchange at
the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan and prevented price
quotations from being transferred from the trading floor to
computer screens in the outside world.
   ``The high-speed futures line is dead,'' Tom Crisalli, an
operations employee with the Commodity Exchange Center, which
oversees the five futures markets, said early Friday afternoon.
   Failing to resolve the problem, the exchanges shut down at 2
p.m. after giving traders a few minutes to settle pending deals.
The regular closing times for most commodities run from 2:20 p.m.
until around 3 p.m. The New York Stock Exchange composite
index-futures contract continued to trade until its normal 4:15
p.m. close.
   Employees said the system began transmitting data again at 2:49
p.m. Officials said the exchanges would reopen Monday. But the
exact cause of the glitch remained unclear.
   Exchange executives took to the floor shortly after 11 a.m. to
inform participants that trading would be halted. The normally
frenzied pace of shouted trading died down. One floor worker played
a George Thorogood rock tune on the harmonica.
   ``It's closed, baby,'' Michael Wilner, president of Hilltop
Trading Co., an energy futures trader, told a California trader who
was unaware of the problem. ``We're done for the day. Period.''
   Wilner said there was some confusion after the halt was
announced but trading had been slow so participants didn't panic.
The problem was further minimized because foreign markets already
had closed for the weekend.
   But market participants said such a shutdown could have caused
chaos if the stock market, for instance, was in turmoil or rumors
about world events that often buffet the markets had been
circulating.
   ``I've been in this business over 10 years. I've never seen it
go down this long and I've never seen it close down early,'' said
John Jonat, a precious- metals trader Deak International Inc.
   Wilner said the event indicated the kinds of perils that affect
financial markets, which rely on sophisticated computer and
telephone communications networks that could go down at any time.
   ``If you go skateboarding you should wear elbow pads, knee pads
and a helmet,'' he said from the exchange floor. ``There are a lot
of forces that impact on the market.''
   Exchange officials said the glitch was in its internal
communications network, not with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
lines that feed data from the exchanges.
   After trades are recorded on slips of paper and entered into
computers on the exchange floor, the futures price information is
relayed to an on-site AT&amp;T facility that in turn relays it to
outside points identified by the exchange.
   ``All indications are that the problems encountered by the
commodity exchanges were not caused by AT&amp;T's network or
equipment,'' AT&amp;T spokeswoman Linda Haertlein said.
   The New York markets trade futures contracts from orange juice
to gold in an open-outcry system where bids are shouted by
designated floor employees. The New York markets trail Chicago's
commodity markets in trading volume and importance.

   For years, Ames Department Stores Inc.
flourished by gobbling up other bankrupt or ailing discount chains.
Now, the once-thriving retailer is learning what it's like to be on
the other side.
   Analysts say Ames can recover from its own bankruptcy filing by
ridding itself of its unprofitable Zayre stores and reorganizing
its own stores.
   But that will be an especially difficult task in a turbulent
retail climate, where bankruptcy filings have become almost as
common as dollar-day sales.
   Ames became the latest casualty in the retail industry when it
filed for protection from its creditors Wednesday under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   The Ames' filing came three months after Campeau Corp.'s Allied
and Federated stores filed for Chapter 11 protection, a move that
sent a wave of panic through the industry. Last summer, the Bonwit
Teller and B. Altman units of the Hooker Corp. also filed for
protection.
   Coupled with the downfalls of smaller retailers, the troubles of
the upscale-Campeau companies and the discount Ames chain has left
suppliers skittish and retailers worrying about who will be next.
   ``The drink of choice used to be Absolut (vodka) on Seventh
Avenue. It's now Maalox,'' said Alan Millstein, publisher of a
monthly newsletter for retailers and manufacturers.
   Retail analysts blame Ames's problems on its 1988 acquisition of
the Zayre discount chain, a deal some analysts now describe as the
albatross that brought Ames down.
   But they also say Ames may have been able to save itself in a
healthier retail climate.
   Howard Davidowitz, chairman of a New York-based retail financial
consulting firm, said Ames's problems are symptoms of the
competitive squeeze that has gripped retailers for the last five
years.
   ``America is badly over-stored and over-shopping centered, and
what happens in that environment is the strong get stronger and the
weak get weaker and fall out,'' Davidowitz said.
   Other analysts say those who blame a new breed of competition in
retail are just whining, and that the recent spate of bankruptcy
filings are really caused by mismanagement and bad decisions.
   The bankruptcy filings by Ames and the Campeau units ``have
nothing to do with anything but people making bad financial
decisions,'' said Jeffrey Branman, managing director for Financo
Inc., a New York investment bank that specializes in retail
industry transactions.
   ``There really is not a revolution that's going on,'' Branman
said. ``This is the normal evolution where the strong get stronger
and the weak get weaker and get shaken out.''
   The tense retail climate caused by recent bankruptcies has led
to a growing number of consolidations, especially among discounters.
   Ironically, Ames rode the crest of the consolidation trend,
swallowing up competitors who were either bankrupt or on the brink
of bankruptcy. From 1974 to 1985, Ames had consumed nearly 500 new
stores by capitalizing on the weaknesses of competitors, including
stores owned by Giant Stores Corp., W.T. Grant Co., KDT Industries
Inc., G.C. Murphy Co., and Neisner Brothers Inc.
   Ames's purchase of the Zayre chain in 1988 is widely seen as the
company's one big blunder. Its $788 million acquisition of the
392-store Zayre chain doubled Ames' size and transformed the
company from a little-known New England-based chain into the
nation's fourth-largest discounter.
   The Zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions, heavy
advertising and discounted fashion items. Ames, by contrast, stocks
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions. The two
styles never meshed successfully.
   Analysts who have watched Ames through its glory days and its
more recent turmoil say the chain's recovery will depend on its
ability to scale back its operations to the manageable and
successful size it had before acquiring the Zayre chain.
   ``It will be a difficult road back for Ames because they have to
divest themselves of all of the Zayre stores and of their own
under-performing stores, and they have to go back to a promotional
discount store to regain consumer recognition,'' said Walter S.
Loeb, president of a New York retail consulting firm.
   Ames's ability to win back the confidence of its suppliers is
also considered critical for any comeback.
   The discounter listed a total of $1.44 billion in liabilities
and $1.66 billion in assets in its bankruptcy filing. Its top 20
creditors include Societe Genenerale Financial Corp., which is owed
just over $14 million; Rubbermaid Inc., which is owed $4.5 million;
and the Sara Lee Group, which is owed nearly $3.9 million.
   Suppliers began cutting off deliveries to Ames last month, after
they were not paid for earlier shipments because of Ames's cash
shortage.
   ``Their basic customer couldn't care less whether the store is
in bankruptcy or not,'' said Millstein. ``All they care about is
seeing their favorite merchandise on the shelves, and to do that
you need suppliers.''

   The dollar declined against most major
currencies Friday in trading dominated by the West German mark and
Japanese yen.
   News that inflation has picked up this year initially caused
heavy dollar buying but it tapered off by late morning.
   Gold prices fell modestly.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for June delivery
settled down 30 cents at $373 a troy ounce after an abbreviated
session. Trading ended early on the Comex, before noon in New York,
because of a communications problem. Later, Republic National Bank
of New York quoted a troy ounce of gold bullion at $371.50 as of 4
p.m. EDT, 90 cents higher than Thursday's late bid.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded within a narrow
range as most of the buying and selling interest was directed
toward the mark and yen.
   ``Really, the day was dominated by cross trading, particularly
the mark-yen,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of
Boston.
   Traders snapped up dollars in the morning after the government
reported that U.S. inflation jumped 6.5 percent in the first
quarter of this year, the steepest increase since a 7.7 percent
advance in the fourth quarter of 1981.
   They bought on the assumption that the Federal Reserve Board
might step up its battle against inflation by pursuing a tighter
credit policy, which would lead to higher interest rates. Higher
rates would boost returns on dollar-denominated investments and
tend to increase demand for dollars.
   But the buying enthusiasm soon waned. Traders apparently
concluded that the central bank wouldn't adjust its policy in the
immediate future. Activity typically slows on Fridays because
traders prefer not to establish significant new positions ahead of
a weekend.
   The inflation reading came in a report that showed the gross
national product, the country's total output of goods and services,
grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first three months of
1990. The GNP figure was in line with expectations and therefore
had little impact on the dollar.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo where it rose to 159.08
Japanese yen from 158.77 yen on Thursday. Later in London, it fell
to 158.80 yen. By the time trading was done for the day in New
York, the dollar had risen to 159.30 yen from 159.23 yen late
Thursday.
   The British pound rose to $1.6360 from $1.6340 late Thursday.
Sterling also strengthened in New York and one pound fetched
$1.6350 in late trading, up from $1.6342 the day before.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's quotes, included: 1.6775 West German marks, down from
1.6797; 1.4530 Swiss francs, down from 1.4575; 5.6290 French
francs, down from 5.6355; 1,230.00 Italian lire, down from
1,231.75; and 1.16375 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1603.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Thursday's rates were: 1.6755 West German marks, down from 1.6810;
1.4560 Swiss francs, down from 1.4605; 5.6240 French francs, down
from 5.6395; 1.8845 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8915; 1,228.00
Italian lire, down from 1,231.00, and 1.1632 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1602.
   Gold prices moved lower on most world markets while silver was
mixed.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $370.75 a troy ounce,
from $372.65 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $370.00, from $372.75 bid late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose 11 cents to close at a bid
373.14.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.95 a
troy ounce from $4.96 bid late Thursday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery closed at
$4.920 a troy ounce, up from $4.913 late Thursday.

   The stock market closed out its second straight
week of losses with a broad decline Friday, registering little
enthusiasm over the latest statistics on economic growth.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 31.53 to 2,645.05,
extending its drop for the week to 50.90 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
403 up, 1,070 down and 491 unchanged.
   Before the trading day began the Commerce Department estimated
that the gross national product grew at a 2.1 percent annual rate,
after adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   An accompanying gauge of inflation showed prices in the
January-March period rising at a 7{-year high of 5.7 percent
annually.
   Analysts said those figures tended to reinforce fears on Wall
Street that the Federal Reserve might soon feel compelled to
tighten credit in its campaign to keep inflation in check.
   Interest rates were mixed in the credit markets, where yields on
Treasury bonds climbed past the 9 percent level Thursday for the
first time in nearly a year. Brokers said some bond traders were a
little relieved that the GNP increase wasn't any bigger than it
turned out to be.
   Citicorp dropped { to 21~ in active trading on word that
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on most of the bank
holding company's debt securities.
   Illinois Power, the day's volume leader, fell 1 to 15 on
turnover of more than 3.2 million shares. A hearing examiner
recommended that the utility be granted just a small part of a
requested rate increase.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included Exxon, down | at
45; International Business Machines, down 1&rsqb; at 107&rsqb;; Philip
Morris, down ~ at 41{, and McDonald's, down \ at 30&rsqb;.
   Sun Microsystems rose } to 23} in the over-the-counter market.
Late Thursday the company reported earnings for its fiscal quarter
ended March 30 of 40 cents a share, up from 38 cents in the
comparable period a year earlier.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 130.63 million
shares, against 141.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 154.66 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $31.04 billion, or 0.97
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slumped 1.92 to 180.74.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.55 to 383.34, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.81 at 329.11.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<HEAD>SEC Hits Denver Penny Stock Brokerage Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the latest round in a decade-long struggle
with penny stock mogul Meyer Blinder, federal regulators on Friday
suspended the firm he founded from trading in the low-cost,
high-risk securities for 45 days, and from underwriting such
offerings for two years.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission, in an administrative
action, also barred Blinder himself from associating with any
registered broker-dealer for at least two years.
   Lawyers in Washington for the firm and Blinder were out of their
offices Thursday afternoon and had not returned a reporter's
telephone call for comment by evening.
   Lawyers in the SEC's enforcement division were at a conference
Friday and also unavailable for comment.
   Normally, however, such findings are appealable either to the
full commission or to a federal judge.
   Blinder, 69, of Denver, Colo., and four associates were indicted
in February on racketeering and securities fraud charges by a
federal grand jury in Las Vegas. The indictment followed a 1988
Internal Revenue Service raid on Blinder Robinson's Denver office.
   Blinder Robinson was once the nation's largest penny stock
brokerage.
   Penny stocks are low cost, high risk securities, usually trading
for less than $3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges
and thus reliable, up-to-the-minute information about them is hard
to obtain.
   That makes penny stocks _ which typically are used to raise
capital for new or small companies _ prone to fraud by unscrupulous
traders and promoters.
   The SEC action dates back to the early 1980s and has see-sawed
back and forth through hearings in the federal courts in Denver and
Washington, as well as administrative actions before the full
commission and administrative law judges.
   The SEC has accused Blinder and the firm of fraud and
manipulative practices involving the securities of America Leisure
Corp., a company that told investors it planned to build and
operate an Atlantic City, N.J. casino-hotel but only owned 1.72
acres of land in Atlantic City, an area deemed too small for such a
venture.

   Here is a look at the six competitors for a
U.S. standard for either high definition TV or enhanced television:
   _ZENITH ELECTRONICS CORP.: Zenith says it has devised technology
to compress the 30 megahertz signal of HDTV into 6 megahertz, the
band width of today's television broadcasts.
   The system transmits the-low frequency portion of the signal
digitally, or in computer language, sharply reducing the power
required for HDTV transmission. By reducing the power, Zenith says
it can boost the high-frequency, picture-side of the signal.
   Zenith has joined American Telephone and Telegraph Co. in
developing its HDTV system, which it says would be available in
1994. Zenith says it is spending $10 million on HDTV research this
year.
   --- _SARNOFF CONSORTIUM: Composed of the David Sarnoff Research
Center in Princeton, N.J., NBC, Philips Consumer Electronics Co.
and Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc.
   It plans to introduce HDTV in two steps. The first, Advanced
Compatible Television, or ACTV, would produce images 30 percent
clearer than today's broadcasts, digital sound and ``ghost-free''
images.
   The group's HDTV proposal is a Philips concept based on an
analog system, the conventional way of sending television signals.
But it says the system will not be ready for testing until late
1991.
   The consortium, which has spent $100 million on these projects
over the past seven years, plans to have ACTV available by 1993 and
full HDTV by 2000. --- _NHK (JAPAN BROADCASTING CORP.): NHK is
proposing two systems: MUSE, an HDTV system, and MUSE-6, which
provides an enhanced version of today's TV. It remains unclear how
much the company is spending for research on these projects.
   --- _MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE of TECHNOLOGY: MIT is proposing a
Channel Compatible System, similar to Zenith's. MIT says the
difference is it provides a more robust signal that eliminates
distortion of regular broadcast channels by the high-definition
signal. The system uses a hybrid digital-analog signal developed
during seven years of research that cost $2 million.
   --- _PRODUCTION SERVICES INC.: The Tuscon, Ariz.-based research
company proposes a system it calls GENESYS, in which a
high-definition signal would be superimposed on a regular broadcast
signal. The completely digital system uses technology to shrink the
HDTV transmission into a 6 megahertz band. The company says it has
spent $2 million over six years developing the technology.
   --- _FAROUDJA LABORATORIES: The Sunnyvale, Calif., research
company proposes an enhancement of the current TV signal that
removes some of the ghosts and squiggles. It is not HDTV. The
amount of money spent on research remains unclear.

   Wendy's International Inc. on Friday
reported its first-quarter profit fell 44 percent from results that
included a onetime gain a year earlier.
   The fast-food restuarant operator said it earned $3.5 million,
or 4 cents per share, in the three months ended April 1, down from
$6.3 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier.
   The company said its 1989 results included a $5.2 million gain
due to an accounting change.
   Revenues slipped 7 percent to $241.3 million from $259.5 million
for the same period of 1989. Wendy's said there were 56 fewer
company-owned restaurants during the 1990 quarter, most of them
sold to franchise owners.
   Wendy's said its Super Value Menu has helped improve the
company's operating performance. The Super Value Menu is a
collection of seven menu items priced at 99 cents in most markets.
   James W. Near, company president and chief executive officer,
said improved efficiency led to higher profit margins.
   ``Although produce costs were higher in the first quarter of
1990, ... the company was able to improve margins through increased
efficiencies,'' Near said. ``We reduced operating expenses to
$200.2 million from $223 million, and raised restaurant operating
margins to 9.8 percent from 6.4 percent.''
   The company has also reduced its reliance on price discounts.
Discount coupons accounted for only 1.4 percent of company sales,
compared to 6 percent in 1989, the company said.
   At the end of the quarter, there were 3,744 Wendy's Old
Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants worldwide, including 1,103
operated by the company.

<HEAD>Exxon Unveils the Extent of its 1990 Summer Cleanup Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Exxon Corp. said Friday its 1990
summer cleanup program on the still-oiled shorelines of Prince
William Sound will consist of small, mobile squads of workers using
techniques that are the least intrusive on the environment.
   The giant oil company has said its crews will be returning to
the beaches on May 1 for a second and final year.
   Hundreds of miles of Alaska shoreline were fouled when the
tanker Exxon Valdez slammed into a charted reef March 24, 1989,
shredding its hull and releasing nearly 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude oil into the water.
   Exxon submitted its cleanup plan Friday to the Federal On-Scene
Coordinator, Coast Guard Rear Adm. David Ciancaglini, who must
approve the proposal before any work is allowed to begin.
   A multi-agency task force has been conducting a shoreline survey
this month and determined that conditions in Prince William Sound
and the Gulf of Alaska had improved dramatically over the winter,
Exxon said.
   As of April 20, 574 miles of shoreline had been inspected. Still
more sites remain to be checked before the survey ends next week.
   Exxon said the inspections showed no evidence of surface oil on
372 miles of shoreline, or 65 percent, very light oiling along
sections of 130 miles, or 22 percent, and a narrow to wide band of
weathered crude along sections of 72 miles, or 13 percent.
   ``The remaining oil is on generally short lengths of shoreline
in scattered locations,'' Otto Harrison, general manager of Exxon's
Alaska operations said in a news release.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation reported the
results of the survey another way Wednesday, saying that 79 percent
of the shoreline sites surveyed were still oiled.
   While there may be some debate over the extent of the campaign,
it's expected that the real controversy may be over the way Exxon
goes about cleaning up what's left of the mess.
   Exxon said it plans to pick up oily debris and tarballs
manually, spotwash certain areas, till and rake sediment and use
bioremediation _ oil-eating bacteria _ to hasten the breakup of the
tarry coating on some beaches.
   But state policymakers are not yet certain they want to use the
fertilizers on the beaches, fearing the release of still more
toxins.
   Exxon expects to have 1,100 people at work on the cleanup by
June 1.

<HEAD>Equimark Pulls Out Of National Bancshares Deal, Opening Way For
Feds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed recapitalization of National Bancshares Corp. of
Texas Inc. fell through Friday when Equimark Corp. pulled out,
laying the basis for the federal takeover of the largest remaining
insolvent bank in Texas.
   Equimark, a $3.7 billion financial services company based in
Pittsburgh, agreed last July to take over the ailing San Antonio
bank holding company, providing $31 million of its own money along
with $250 million from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   However, the deal was contingent on approval by holders of at
least 85 percent of $25 million National Bancshare's debt, and on
Thursday the bank holding company said holders of only 25 percent
had given their approval by the 5 p.m. deadline.
   ``Obviously we are disappointed that this transaction cannot go
forward as planned,'' said Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer.
   National Bancshares had assets of $2.3 billion last July, but
that has shrunk to about $1.9 billion.
   ``The FDIC and other regulatory agencies are proceeding to
consider alternative resolutions to the NBC situation, including
contact with qualified prospective acquirers,'' FDIC spokesman
David Barr said Friday.
   Those alternatives include closing National Bancshare's
insolvent banks, and selling them immediately to another
institution, or operating them as ``bridge banks'' until a buyer
can be found.
   A sale offer could rekindle the interest of a host of other
banks who had originally taken a look at National Bancshares last
year. Included in that list were NCNB Texas National Bank, the
state's largest holding company; Minneapolis investor Carl Pohlad
together with Norwest Corp.; and Security Pacific Corp.
   However Robert Rieke, banking analysts at Rauscher Pierce Refnes
Inc. brokerage in Dallas, predicted two Texas banks _ First City
Bancorp. of Texas Inc. and Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc., a
subsidiary of Chemical Banking Co. _ will show the greatest
interest.
   ``I cannot imagine an out-of-state organization coming to Texas
and using (National Bancshares) as a platform,'' he said.
   National Bancshares, once the eighth largest bank holding
company in Texas and second largest bank in San Antonio, lost $28.5
million in the first quarter of this year, following a loss of
$429.1 million in the previous four years.
   Declining real estate and energy markets have sapped many Texas
banks in recent years, forcing many of the into private or
federally funded recapitalizations.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise, But Yield Remains Above 9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices rose slightly Friday in light
trading as the market shrugged off a government report showing
strong economic growth and rising inflation. But long Treasury bond
yields remained above 9 percent.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond rose 5-32 point, or
$1.56 for each $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when
prices rise, dipped to 9.02 percent from 9.04 percent late Thursday.
   The yield on the 30-year Treasury finished above 9 percent
Thursday for the first time in almost a year. The yield is
important since it is used to calculate some mortgage and other
loan rates.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product rose 2.1
percent in the first quarter, almost double the previous quarter's
rate. A price gauge tied to the GNP shot up an annual rate of 6.5
percent from the 4.5 percent for all of last year.
   Both reports normally would be bad news for the bond market
because inflation erodes the value of fixed-income securities such
as bonds and because a healthy economy makes it less likely the
Federal Reserve will act to ease interest rates.
   But the figures had been expected by bond traders _ in fact,
some anticipated the inflation figure would be even higher, said
James Marshall, a trader with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   After the release of the numbers, bond prices rose, then fell,
then rose again. Some traders said the market appeared to be
reacting to different components of the report.
   ``The market didn't know which way it wanted to go,'' Marshall
said.
   Bond prices had been down all week. ``People have been saying it
(the market) is oversold and can't go down forever,'' Marshall
said. ``But then we've got a lot of supply coming up for the
quarterly refunding. That always causes a lot of consternation,''
he said, referring to the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction
next month.
   ``You have these two forces at work and they really kind of
washed each other out today.''
   Another force at work was the need by some traders to cover
their short positions before the weekend by buying bonds, he added.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose by between 5-32 point and 3-16 point,
intermediate maturities rose by 3-32 point to 5-32 point, and
long-term issues rose by &lsqb; point to 7-32 point, according to
figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.84 to 1,129.54.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 11-32 point to 89 5-32. The average
yield to maturity rose to 7.73 percent from 7.70 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.02 percent as the
discount fell 5 basis points to 7.77 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 8.34 percent as the discount fell 9 basis points to
7.91 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.51 percent as the
discount fell 10 basis points to 7.92 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, down from 8 3-16
percent late Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former Paramount Pictures Corp. executives
were accused in a federal indictment Friday of taking kickbacks
such as cash and free use of a summer house from two companies
doing business with the movie producer.
   The indictment, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
charged Gordon Weaver and Stephen Rose with not reporting the
kickbacks as income on their 1983 and 1984 tax returns.
   Weaver, 52, the former president of the Worldwide Marketing
Division of Paramount's Motion Picture Division, additionally was
charged with conspiracy. He resigned in 1984 after a company
investigation.
   Weaver and Rose, formerly the vice president of marketing of the
Motion Picture Division, allegedly extorted the kickbacks under
threat that Paramount would withhold its business, the indictment
said.
   ``These unsupported allegations were first made six years ago.
They were subsequently reviewed by two different organizations with
which I was associated and found to be utterly lacking in
credibility,'' Weaver said in a statement.
   ``I now at least will be provided the opportunity to once and
for all put these slanderous charges to rest,'' he said.
   It was not clear to what organizations Weaver was referring in
his statement.
   A call to Rose's attorney, Gerald Walpin, was not immediately
returned.
   Weaver was accused of receiving numerous cash payments from
Spiros Associates, an advertising company, and Filmland Production
Inc. He also allegedly had free use during the summer of 1983 of a
house on Fire Island rented by Filmland.
   The indictment said Rose solicited a kickback from Filmland by
asking the company to buy him a Mercedes-Benz automobile. It also
said Rose received about $1,000 a month between April 1983 and May
1984 as payments for a car loan.
   Rose additionally was accused of receiving $2,260 from Filmland
in November 1983 to pay expenses for his daughter's bar mitzvah.
   Weaver and Rose also allegedly received color television sets
from Filmland.
   Weaver was charged with conspiracy and filing false tax returns
in 1983 and 1984. If convicted, he faces a maximum of 11 years in
prison and $600,000 in fines.
   The indictment charged Rose with the filing of a false tax
return in 1983, which carries a maximum penalty of three years in
prison and a $100,000 fine.

<HEAD>Soybeans Surge To 9-Month High On Supply, Weather Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged Friday to their highest levels
since last summer, extending a rally linked to the rain-slowed
Brazilian harvest and fears that the recent hot, dry Midwestern
weather might be a harbinger of drought.
   On other commodity markets, grain futures ended mixed, cattle
were higher; pork futures were mixed; oil futures were mixed; and
precious metals were mixed.
   Trading in oil, precious metals and a number of other
commodities ended before noon EDT after a communications glitch at
New York's Commodity Exchange Center prevented price quotes from
the five New York markets from reaching customers.
   The trading halt affected the New York Mercantile Exchange; the
Commodity Exchange; the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange; the New
York Cotton Exchange; and the New York Futures Exchange. Officials
said the problem was corrected Friday afternoon and normal trading
would resume on Monday.
   Soybean futures settled 7{ cents to 10} cents higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade with the contract for delivery in May up 8}
cents at $6.35 a bushel, the highest settlement of a near-month
soybean contract since July 28.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 5} cents higher with May at
$3.70{ a bushel; corn was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with May
at $2.80 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with
May at $1.62\ a bushel.
   The rise in soybean futures followed leaps of 17 cents Thursday
and 10} cents Wednesday in the May soybean contract.
   Soybean meal for May delivery settled $3.90 higher at $184.40
amid the heaviest trading volume in exchange history. The Board of
Trade said Friday's volume of 54,815 meal contracts surpassed the
previous high of 45,411 set Oct. 20, 1987.
   Analysts said some of the underlying support in the soybean
complex was provided by the relatively slow pace of soybean and
soymeal exports from South America, mainly due to wet-weather
harvest delays in Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean
producer.
   ``They've had rain pretty much on a steady basis for a month
now,'' said Walter Spilka of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   He said the Brazilian harvest was about half complete but would
be 80 percent finished by now if the harvest was progressing at a
normal pace.
   The slow Brazilian harvest is fueling speculation that European
nations may need to buy U.S. soybean meal for livestock feed,
according to Spilka and others.
   The strong soybean market also may have reflected speculation
that the past week's unusually warm, dry Midwestern weather could
extend into the growing season, analysts said.
   But several said it was too early in the growing season to worry
about a repeat of the 1988 drought.
   After the close of trading Friday, a National Weather Service
forecast predicted normal to below-normal temperatures and normal
to above-normal rainfall for the region through the end of July.
   Cattle futures posted modest gains on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange amid buying prompted by the low price of futures versus
the cash cattle markets.
   Further support came from a a strong rally in the adjacent
pork-belly pit early in the session, although those gains were
later trimmed.
   Live cattle settled .40 cent to .55 cent higher with June at
73.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .73 cent higher
with May at 82.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .57 cent lower to
.10 cent higher with June at 63 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .80 cent lower to .95 cent higher with May at 64.65 cents a
pound.
   In a shortened session on the New York Merc, West Texas
Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents to 12 cents higher with June
at $18.54 a barrel; heating oil was .14 cent to .67 cent higher
with May at 53.74 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .39 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with May at 60.95 cents a gallon.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents lower in a short session on
the Commodity Exchange with June at $373 a troy ounce; silver ended
0.6 cent to 3.2 cents higher with May at $4.92 a troy ounce.

   Summer camp directors planned letters to parents
and pharmacies yanked cans from shelves Friday after two top insect
repellents were recalled because a long-used ingredient made lab
rats sick.
   The Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that the
makers of Deep Woods OFF! and Cutter's insect repellents had
voluntarily recalled their products because of the findings.
   The ingredient's manufacturer, McLaughlin Gormley King Co. of
Minneapolis, told the government that preliminary testing showed an
additive known as R-11 gave tumors to lab rats and withered their
ovaries. The company asked that its license to make the product be
withdrawn.
   About 200 brands of repellent use R-11, which helps repel flies
that bite.
   ``I will just make sure that when my final notice goes out to
parents, if they don't know about it not to send anything with
their child that's on the recall list,'' said Betsy Cobb, owner of
Camp Runoia, a small girls camp in Belgrade Lakes, Maine.
   Cobb said the camp does not recommend a brand of insect
repellent children should bring, but said she would check to see
what children were using.
   ``I would not put it on a child,'' said Dolly Jacobson, owner of
Buck and Beaver Camp in Shohola, Pa., in the Poconos mountains,
which attracts about 100 boys and girls ages 7 to 15.
   ``I'm planning on covering it during orientation _ telling them
to be on the lookout in case parents haven't heard about it,'' she
said.
   Two of the major users of the additive are S.C. Johnson and Son
Co. of Racine, Wis., which makes OFF! products, and Miles Co. of
Elkhart, Ind., producer of Cutter's.
   OFF! spokeswoman Barbara Jorgensen said 150,000 cases of Deep
Woods OFF! containing R-11 were in circulation. The company on
April 6 asked retailers to return the product and exchange it for a
newly formulated one.
   Deep Woods OFF! has contained R-11 since it was first
manufactured in 1973. The new version will will bear a red sticker
on the cap saying ``New Forumla,'' she said. Other OFF! products
are not affected by the recall.
   ``There's a huge concern that there would be product
confusion,'' said Jorgensen. ``We don't want people to overreact to
this and not use insect repellents this season ...''
   Miles Inc. on April 10 asked its retailers to return Cutter's
aeresol, pump spray and lotion, which contained R-11. The new
versions without the chemical will have a yellow sticker.
   ``Our concern is that consumers not become overly alarmed
because this does not pose a health risk,'' company spokeswoman
Dionn Tron said.
   Rite Aid Corp., one of the nation's leading drug-store chains,
notified its 2,350 stores in 22 states to pull the problem
repellents from shelves. A Rite Aid official said the company was
waiting to retrieve all the old formula before stocking the new
versions.
   ``We do have the new formula in warehouses but we want to make
sure we only get the product that manufacturers have approved as
safe on the shelves,'' said the official, who asked not to be named.
   Bonnie Carmody, manager of Naults Heights Pharmacy in Concord,
N.H., said she pulled the remaining 12 cans of the products off the
shelves Friday after a pharmacist heard a news report about the
recall.
   She said Deep Woods OFF! and Cutter's products were big sellers
in New England _ dreaded for its summer bug migration _ and she
expected consumers to buy the replacement versions.
   About 25 percent of all insect repellents on the market use the
additive, formally known as
2,3,4,5-Bis(2,butylene)tetrahydro-2-furaldehyde. The technical name
appears on product labels.
   The government said it has done no independent testing of R-11,
requiring pesticide manufacturers to conduct safety tests, and does
not know how dangerous it may be. The ingredient has been used for
35 years.

<HEAD>House Resolution Introduced Urging Strike Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A resolution urging a resumption of bargaining
in the eight-week-old Greyhound bus strike and deploring strike
violence was introduced Thursday in the House by Rep. Pat Williams,
D-Mont., and about 100 co-sponsors.
   ``The toll exacted by this increasingly bitter dispute is
worsening with each day that passes without negotiations,''
Williams said.
   Greyhound has refused to resume negotiations until a week passes
without a shooting or bomb threat; the last confirmed incident
occurred Monday. Talks broke down March 18 in Tucson, Ariz., and
have been stalled ever since.
   The Amalgamated Transit Union, which has condemned the nearly 40
shootings and other violent incidents that have occurred, has said
it was willing to resume contract talks at any time.
   ``We wish that the company would see the error in its ways,
particularly in regard to this business of putting the bargaining
process in the hands of some kook out there who might make a phone
call or pick up a weapon,'' said union spokesman Nick Nichols.
   Greyhound spokesman George Gravley said the company welcomed
Congress' condemnation of the violence and that Greyhound
executives would resume bargaining when seven days passed without
violence.
   The bus line's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 of its office and
maintenance workers walked out March 2 over wages and job security.
The company, which operates the only nationwide bus system, has
been running on a reduced schedule since then, using replacements
and union members who cross picket lines.

<HEAD>Board Remaining Neutral on Japonica Debt Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International's board of directors
said it intends to remain neutral on a suitor's proposed purchase
of the company's debentures.
   Japonica Partners, which is challenging Allegheny's bankruptcy
reorganization plan, has offered to buy the debentures of Allegheny
and its wholly owned subsidiary, Chemetron Corp.
   ``The board of directors does not recommend that debenture
holders accept or reject the Japonica offer and is remaining
neutral,'' the company said Thursday in a statement. ``Just as
voting on a reorganization plan is an individual matter, so is the
decision whether to accept or reject Japonica's offer.''
   The board also said it supports the company's reorganization
proposal as ``the only viable plan'' that ``is in the best
interests of all creditors and shareholders.''
   The manufacturer of Sunbeam and Oster appliances also announced
Thursday it posted a net loss of $7.4 million in the second quarter
of its fiscal 1990, or $1.38 a share. That compared with a loss of
$4.6 million, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. Sales were $253.7
million vs. $268.3 million.
   Allegheny International blamed this year's losses on a decline
in the sale of small appliances and outdoor patio furniture, as
well as ``highly competitive market conditions and an unstable
retail environment.''

<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz of North America is
recalling 1,584 of its 300-class medium-size cars to replace a part
for an auxiliary engine cooling fan, the automaker said Friday.
   The company said that when the auxiliary fan is working at a low
speed, heat from the pre-resistor could cause its protective
plastic cover to melt and possibly burn. Three incidents of the
plastic cover melting have been reported, but none have involved
injury, the company said.
   Dealers will replace the pre-resistor with one that has a metal
cover at no charge, according to the company, which has its North
American base in Montvale.
   The cars being recalled are some 1990-model 300E 2.6, 300E and
300E 4Matic sedans, 300TE and 300TE 4Matic station wagons and 300CE
coupes, the company said.
   The pre-resistor is a device to reduce the voltage supplied to
the auxiliary fan to enable it to run at different speed, depending
on the engine coolant temperature.
   Mercedes-Benz suggested owners of the involved cars only operate
the climate control system in the economy mode until the faulty
unit is replaced.

<HEAD>SEC Reportedly Asks NASD to Explore Electronic Pricing for Junk
Bonds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission has asked the National Association of Securities Dealers
to explore the development of an electronic pricing system for the
junk bond market, a newspaper reported.
   Such a system could improve liquidity in the ailing market for
high-yield bonds and increase investor interest in the securities,
The New York Times said in an early edition of Friday's paper.
   The request is based on a new computerized trading system the
association has developed for securities issued via private
placement. The SEC authorized big institutional investors to trade
such securities last week and at the same time approved the trading
system, known as Portal.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden has asked the association to
examine whether Portal could be used to quote prices of junk bonds,
the Times reported.
   ``At the request of the SEC, we are exploring whether we can use
the same software that we developed for Portal in the pricing of
high-yield securities,'' Joseph Hardiman, president of NASD, was
quoted as saying.
   ``There is obviously a void in the pricing of those securities,
and there is strong demand among buyers, legislators and regulators
to see if we can come up with something.''
   Prices and trading activity in the junk bond market have been
depressed for months by defaults, bankruptcy filings by major
issuers and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which used
to dominate the market.

   Federal regulators on Friday said they banned
the former president of the second-largest savings institution in
New Jersey from working for a a bank, thrift or credit union.
   Office of Thrift Supervision Director Timothy Ryan signed the
order Thursday after an administrative law judge found that Gerald
R. O'Keeffe, former president of First Atlantic Savings and Loan
Association, South Plainfield, N.J., ``had been personally
dishonest and had acted in willful disregard for First Atlantic's
safety and soundness.''
   The agency said O'Keeffe:
   _Accepted unauthorized compensation in excess of $40,000 from a
subsidiary.
   _Carried large interest-free overdraft balances in his checking
account at First Atlantic for lengthy periods.
   _Took out mortgage and personal loans at advantageous rates.
   _Participated in investor partnerships that dealt with First
Atlantic's real estate ventures at advantageous terms.
   O'Keeffe, who resigned in January, is banned from working for a
federally insured institution without advance permission from
regulators. His institution was seized by the government Feb. 23.

   The nation's economy grew at a 2.1 percent
rate in the first quarter but private analysts said an ``ugly''
inflation rate could mean higher interest rates that would slow
growth later this year.
   Besides strength in the gross national product _ the nation's
total output of goods and services _ the Commerce Department
reported Friday that inflation jumped 6.5 percent, its steepest
jump since a 7.7 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1981.
The GNP inflation rate for 1989 was 4.5 percent.

   President Bush has spared Japan from a ``hit

   Bush's move Friday amounted to a reward for Japan because of its
efforts to ease trade tensions between the two economic

country _ India _ under a tough section of U.S. trade law.

shut down early after a communications glitch prevented thousands
of traders, brokers and investors from receiving price data.
   Action in the nation's major oil and metals trading pits came to
a standstill at 11:20 a.m. Friday when the exchanges discovered
that no price quotes were leaving the building.
   Exchanges employees and participants said it was the first time
in recent memory that the markets were closed because of a

   Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the nation's
toughest anti-takeover law, saying it would discourage corporate
raiders from stripping jobs and economic vitality from Pennsylvania.
   Within hours, the law was challenged Friday by two suits filed
in federal court that claimed an unconstitutional infringment on
shareholder and investor rights.
   For the first time in any state, raiders will be forced to
surrender short-term profits from thwarted takeover attempts. The
law also restricts the voting rights of raiders and preserves labor
contracts when corporations change hands.

<HEAD>GM To Include Electronic Ignition On Nearly All Models</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY BAIR</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. will install electronic
security devices as standard equipment in the ignition systems of
nearly all its cars by 1994, GM Chairman-elect Robert Stempel said
Friday.
   The Pass-Key system, currently available on about one-eighth of
GM's fleet, relies on a computer chip embedded in a key. The chip
communicates electronically with the engine through the ignition
lock.
   If the lock reads an unfamiliar code, the car's starter and fuel
lines are disabled for several minutes, according to Delco
Electronics, the GM division that makes Pass-Key.
   The system shuts down the starter and fuel lines if a thief
tries to start a car without a key, Delco said.
   Stempel said the 1991 Saturn line of cars, scheduled for release
this fall, would include the Pass-Key as standard equipment.
   ``By the time we get through 1993, virtually all of our cars
will have this electronic system,'' Stempel said in a telephone
interview from Detroit. ``The thief will have to pick the car up
and cart it away if he wants to steal it.''
   ``It's not an end-all to the theft problem, but it helps,'' said
Stempel, a senior GM executive who was recently named to succeed
Roger Smith as chairman.
   GM spokeswoman Toni Simonetti declined to say how much the
Pass-Key project would cost, either in total or on a per-car basis.
   The system first appeared on the 1986 Chevrolet Corvette.
   It since has been installed on the Chevrolet Camaro, Pontiac
Firebird, Oldsmobile Toronado, Buick Reatta and Riveria and
Cadillac Allante, Seville, Eldorado, DeVille and Fleetwood, GM said.
   In January, February and March, GM sold 101,807 of the 11
Pass-Key-equipped cars, or 12.3 percent of the company's total
sales.
   Spokesmen for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said the
companies, which with GM make up the nation's Big Three automakers,
had announced no plans to install electronic-security devices in
car ignitions.

   Pennzoil Co. announced Friday its first quarter
earnings declined 38 percent largely because of a poor performance
by its sulphur division and a decline in its motor oil and
automotive products operations.
   For the first three months of 1990, Pennzoil earned $32.7
million, or 85 cents per share, compared with earnings of $52.5
million, or $1.34 per share, during the first quarter of 1989.
   Revenue fell 4 percent to $553.2 million from $576.3 million a
year ago.
   ``Operating income from the company's oil and gas operations was
up sharply over 1989 levels, due to higher crude oil and natural
gas prices,'' said James L. Pate, Pennzoil's president. ``However,
the gain was largely offset by lower prices and volumes in the
sulphur division.''
   ``Operating income for the motor oil and automotive products
segment was somewhat lower due to decreased motor oil volumes and
increased cost,'' he said.
   The company's oil and gas division posted profits of $45.8
million, up 92 percent from $23.8 million in 1989.
   The sulphur division, however, had a 67 percent decline in its
operating profit to $9.9 million from $30.1 million a year earlier.
Its motor oil and automotive products sector had a 22 percent
decline in profits for the first quarter _ to $19.6 million this
year from $24.7 million in 1989.

   General Electric Co. and Lockheed Corp.
announced thousands of job cuts Friday, a move analysts say is
fueled in part by decreases in defense spending.
   GE said it will eliminate about 4,200 hourly and salaried jobs
over the next two years at five GE Aerospace locations in New York
and New Jersey.
   Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., plans to lay off 2,750
workers in its plane-building division, including about 2,000 in
Southern California.
   The job cuts, which had been expected, were the second big round
of aerospace layoffs in as many days to hit Southern California.
   On Thursday, McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it will eliminate
3,000 jobs at its Long Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit this
summer to reduce the costs of jet aircraft production at the
money-losing division.
   ``The basic reason for the reductions is we're looking at cuts
in the defense budget,'' said Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst for
Argus Research Corp. in New York. ``If they keep all those people,
they will be expending money and will not have the same amount
coming in.''
   Steven Binder, an analyst at Bear, Sterns and Co. in New York,
said the job cuts are ``reflective of future defense cuts and
spending.''
   ``During recent years the Defense Department has had to cut
procurement and research and development. That has made it
necessary for companies to reduce employment,'' he said.
   GE's cuts stem in part from efforts to reorganize its aerospace
defense businesses so the company can remain successful despite a
shrinking market and increased competition.
   GE says it will take advantage of projected attrition and
retirements of about 2,000 employees to reduce significantly the
number of employees actually laid off.
   The reductions are scheduled to take place at plants in
Binghamton, Syracuse and Utica, N.Y. and Camden and Moorestown, N.J.
   ``We are taking decisive actions now to enable our business to
meet its future commitments to customers and ensure that GE
Aerospace will be a vital, industry-leading business for many years
to come,'' said Jon Rittenhouse, senior vice president for GE
Aerospace, which is based in Valley Forge.
   ``We're entering a decade that will provide a difficult
challenge for defense companies,'' he said. ``... By taking these
steps, we are protecting the long-term competitive outlook for the
business.''
   Where layoffs are necessary, GE will offer financial assistance
based on length of service and medical and life insurance coverage
for up to one year from the date of layoff. The company also will
offer job-finding assistance.
   The cuts affect about 15 percent of the company's 6,000
employees at three Syracuse-area plants. They are the first
significant local layoffs since the company shut down its picture
tube production operation in November 1986.
   GE, Syracuse's largest employer, will cut 200 salaried jobs by
the end of 1990, said GE spokeswoman Connie Grasso. Another 420
hourly jobs and 250 salaried will be eliminated over the next two
years.
   Layoffs at the three local sites in the towns of Geddes, DeWitt
and Salina will begin as early as June 1.
   James Ragsdale, a spokesman for Lockheed's Aeronautical Systems
Co. in Burbank, said 750 employees who will lose their jobs are
based in Marietta, Ga., where Lockhee had built the huge C-5 cargo
plane.
   The C-5 is just one of four Lockheed military planes whose
production had ended recently or is to end soon. The others are the
P-3 sub-hunter, the TR-1 high-altitude reconnaissance plane, and
the F117A stealth fighter.
   ``It is unlikely we will have any large new military aircraft
production project that will begin before the mid-1990s,'' Ken
Cannestra, the president of the aeronautics unit, said in a
statement.
   Lockheed, the nation's sixth-biggest military contractor, saw
its profits fall from $624 million in 1988 to just $2 million last
year. One big reason was that the company underestimated by
hundreds of millions of dollars the costs of developing a new
warplane, the P-7, a replacement for the P-3.

   Staloff won a reputation as an innovator of financial products
when he was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and
president of the Philadelphia Board of Trade.
   But he apparently encountered conflict at Comex where members,
mainly trading houses and individual traders, have a reputation for
being strong-willed and who effectively run the exchange.
   The Comex is the nation's major gold, silver and copper futures
exchange, but it is a distant fourth in size behind the Chicago
Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Trading volume at the exchange has been sluggish and the Comex
has had trouble developing innovative futures products to compete
with the big Chicago exchanges.

   Donald Trump may not be nearly as rich as he
claims, Forbes magazine says in an article that if true would bump
the tycoon out of the world billionaire's club.
   Forbes has slashed its estimate of Trump's net worth by more
than $1 billion, to around $500 million. In its May 14 cover story,
which Forbes made available Friday, the magazine says it revised
the estimate after examining nonpublic documents submitted by Trump
last year to a government body, which Forbes declined to specify.
   The article challenges Trump's claim in the documents to have a
net worth of $1.5 billion. It also questions whether Trump's cash
flow is sufficient to cover the debt and interest payments on his
vast holdings.
   The developer said Friday he has discussed selling or
refinancing most of his major asset to raise money to buy new
properties. Trump said he has hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to
negotiate a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle less than a year
after buying the airline and sticking his name on it.
   Trump said he is interested in raising cash now so that he will
have funds on hand in the future to acquire additional properties.
   His assets also include New York's Plaza Hotel, the glitzy Trump
Tower skyscraper on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, and casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., including the $1 billion Taj Mahal casino,
which recently opened.
   In a statement released late Friday, Trump Organization said
Forbes made a ``mathematical mistake or purposeful omission'' by
not including $160 million a year in anticipated operating profit
from the Taj Mahal, while including the new casino's debt service.
   ``They (Forbes) made a major mistake here,'' said a Trump
spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name.
   He declined comment on the broader question of Trump's total net
worth. ``Only Donald Trump's accountants know this,'' he said.
``Forbes magazine may guess, as others do, but they really don't
know.''
   Ray Healey, a spokesman for the magazine, responded, ``We've
done a very thorough analysis and we stand by our story.''
   Using the list of properties in Trump's 1989 documents, and
updating their values, Forbes said it came up with a total market
value of slightly less than $3.7 billion. However, with nearly $3.2
billion in debt, Trump's cash shortfall may be nearly $40 million a
year, the business magazine estimated.
   Some of the interest on his debt is accruing rather than being
paid in cash.
   In the documents, Trump claims a net worth, after deducting all
debts and mortgages, of $1.5 billion, Forbes noted in the article
entitled ``Manhattan's Favorite Guessing Game: How Rich is Donald?''
   The magazine's own estimate in 1989 was $1.7 billion.
   ``Double-whammied by a real estate recession and problems with
his gambling casinos, Donald Trump may be down to his last
half-billion in net worth and he has little liquidity,'' the
article says. ``That's not comfortable for a guy with more than $3
billion in debt.''
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Trump insisted
that he is ``very liquid now.''
   ``I want to build up cash because I think cash is going to be
king,'' he said.
